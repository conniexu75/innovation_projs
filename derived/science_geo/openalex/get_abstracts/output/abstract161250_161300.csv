https://openalex.org/W1537745645,"Multiple lines of evidence, from molecular and cellular to epidemiological, have implicated nicotinic transmission in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show the signal transduction mechanism involved in nicotinic receptor-mediated protection against β-amyloid-enhanced glutamate neurotoxicity. Nicotine-induced protection was suppressed by an α7 nicotinic receptor antagonist (α-bungarotoxin), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002 and wortmannin), and a Src inhibitor (PP2). Levels of phosphorylated Akt, an effector of PI3K, and Bcl-2 were increased by nicotine. The α7 nicotinic receptor was physically associated with the PI3K p85 subunit and Fyn. These findings indicate that the α7 nicotinic receptor transduces signals to PI3K in a cascade, which ultimately contributes to a neuroprotective effect. This might form the basis of a new treatment for AD."

Recently, tumstatin (the NC1 domain of α3 chain of type IV collagen) was identified as possessing anti-angiogenic activity. In the present study, the anti-angiogenic activity of tumstatin was localized to the putative 54–132-amino acid Tum-5 domain, and the activity mediated by αvβ3 integrin interaction in an RGD-independent manner. The recombinant Tum-5 produced inEscherichia coli and Pichia Pastorisspecifically inhibited proliferation and caused apoptosis of endothelial cells with no significant effect on nonendothelial cells. Tum-5 also inhibited tube formation of endothelial cells on Matrigel and induced G1 endothelial cell cycle arrest. Moreover, anti-angiogenic effect of Tum-5 was also examined in vivousing both a Matrigel plug assay in C57BL/6 mice and human prostate cancer (PC-3) xenografts in nude mice. The in vivo results demonstrate that Tum-5 at 1 mg/kg significantly inhibited growth of PC-3 tumors in association with a decrease in CD31 positive vasculature. These in vivo studies also show that, at molar equivalents, human Tum-5 is at least 10-fold more active than human endostatin. In addition, these studies for the first time suggest that through the action of endogenous inhibitors, αvβ3 integrin may also function as a negative regulator of angiogenesis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Tum-5, a domain derived from tumstatin, is an effective inhibitor of tumor-associated angiogenesis and a promising candidate for the treatment of cancer.

The tumor cell component and the endothelium of blood vessels function in concert to coordinate the expansion of tumor tissue (1Folkman J. Nat.

Basement membranes are organized as thin layers of specialized extracellular matrix that provide the supporting scaffold for epithelial and endothelial cells (8Paulsson M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 93-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Basement membranes not only provide a mechanical support but also influence cellular behavior such as differentiation, proliferation, and migration of various cells including endothelial cells. Vascular basement membrane constitutes an insoluble structural wall of newly formed capillaries and is speculated to play an important role in regulating pro- and anti-angiogenic events (6Colorado P.C. Torre A. Kamphaus G. Maeshima Y. Hopfer H. Takahashi K. Volk R. Zamborsky E.D. Herman S. Ericksen M.B. Dhanabal M. Simons M. Post M. Kufe D.W. Weichselbaum R.R. Sukhatme V.P. Kalluri R.

Biol. 1996; 8: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) and is expressed as six distinct α-chains, namely, α1–α6 (12Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). These α-chains are assembled into triple helices that further form a network to provide a scaffold for other macromolecules to interact with the basement membrane. These α-chains are composed of three domains, the N-terminal 7 S domain, the middle triple helical domain, and the C-terminal globular noncollagenous domain (NC1)1 (13Timpl R. Wiedemann H. van Delden V. Furthmayr H. Kuhn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 120: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Type IV collagen is thought to be important in endothelial cell proliferation and behavior during the angiogenic process (5Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H. Ramchandran R. Torre A.

The NC1 domain of type IV collagen plays a crucial role in the assembly of type IV collagen to form trimers and thus influences basement membrane organization, which is important for new blood vessel formation (9Madri J.A.

Synthetic peptides (amino acids 185–203) derived from NC1 domain of α3 chain of type IV collagen (α3(IV)NC1) have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of melanoma in vitro (15Han J. Ohno N.

Recently, we identified that α3(IV)NC1, termed “tumstatin,” possessed a novel anti-angiogenic activity (7Maeshima Y. Colorado P.C. Torre A. Holthaus K.A. Grunkemeyer J.A. Ericksen M.D. Hopfer H.

Integrin αvβ3 is potentially associated with angiogenic vascular cells and plays a critical role in angiogenesis and in promotion of endothelial cell survival (18Brooks P.C. Clark R.A. Cheresh D.A.

Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). In this regard, we recently identified that tumstatin binds to αvβ3 integrin in a RGD-independent manner, and this binding is essential for its anti-angiogenic activity (20Maeshima Y. Colorado P.C. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23745-23750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In the present study, the putative 54–132-amino acid anti-angiogenic domain of tumstatin as determined by deletion mutagenesis (7Maeshima Y. Colorado P.C. Torre A. Holthaus K.A. Grunkemeyer J.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21340-21348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) was expressed as recombinant protein (Tum-5) using Escherichia coli and yeast (Pichia pastoris). Tum-5 inhibits neovascularization and tumor growth in vivo using two different model systems. Tum-5 also inhibits angiogenesis through αvβ3 integrin interaction on endothelial cells as previously shown for the full-length tumstatin. Results obtained in the present study suggest that Tum-5 binds predominantly to β3 subunit of αvβ3 integrin. Additionally, Tum-5 interaction with αvβ3integrin is independent of vitronectin or fibronectin binding to endothelial cells, suggesting that Tum-5 may function as an angiogenesis inhibitor via negative regulation of αvβ3 integrin on endothelial cells. In addition, the present study also demonstrates that the anti-angiogenic activity of Tum-5 is not dependent on disulfide bond linkage. These results strongly implicate the use of this novel protein domain as a possible drug candidate in the treatment of diseases dependent on angiogenesis. The sequence encoding deletion mutants (Tum-1–5) of tumstatin was amplified using polymerase chain reaction from the α3(IV)NCI/pDS vector as previously described (7Maeshima Y. Colorado P.C. Torre A. Holthaus K.A. Grunkemeyer J.A. Ericksen M.D. Hopfer H. Xiao Y. Stillman I.E. Kalluri R. J. Biol.

Expression of recombinant protein in E. coli and purification using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) was performed as previously described (7Maeshima Y. Colorado P.C. Torre A. Holthaus K.A. Grunkemeyer J.A. Ericksen M.D. Hopfer H. Xiao Y. Stillman I.E. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21340-21348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Amino acids 45–132 of tumstatin were expressed as Tum-5, which includes the N-terminal 9 amino acids in addition to the previously identified anti-angiogenic domain (54–132 amino acids) (7Maeshima Y. Colorado P.C. Torre A. Holthaus K.A. Grunkemeyer J.A. Ericksen M.D. Hopfer H. Xiao Y. Stillman I.E. Kalluri R. J. Biol.

Only soluble protein with a low endotoxin level (less than 50 enzyme units/mg) was used in these experiments. Recombinant full-length tumstatin was expressed using 293 human embryonic kidney cells as previously described (7Maeshima Y. Colorado P.C. Torre A. Holthaus K.A. Grunkemeyer J.A.

Recombinant Tum-5 was expressed in yeast using P. pastoris with a method previously described (22Dhanabal M. Ramchandran R. Volk R. Stillman I.E. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Simons M. Sukhatme V.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar). pPICZαA was used for the subcloning of Tum-5 so that Tum-5 would be fused to C-terminal 6-histidine tag. Site-directed mutagenesis (C126 to A126) was induced to facilitate enhanced secretion of Tum-5 (Tum-5/126C-A). Human endostatin was expressed in yeast using P. pastoris with a previously described method (22Dhanabal M. Ramchandran R. Volk R. Stillman I.E. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Simons M. Sukhatme V.P.

These peptides were synthesized and characterized as previously described (25Arap W. Pasqualini R. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1998; 279: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar). Recombinant Tum-5 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as previously described (26Kalluri R. Sun M.J. Hudson B.G. Neilson E.G. J. Biol.

Goat anti-rabbit IgG and anti-human IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-polyhistidine tag antibody was purchased from Invitrogen, and monoclonal anti-polyhistidine tag antibody conjugated with peroxidase was purchased from Sigma. Bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (C-PAE), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line (PC-3), and NIH3T3 fibroblasts were all obtained from American Type Culture Collection. These cell lines were maintained in DMEM (C-PAE; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 mg/ml of streptomycins; in EGM-2 (HUVEC; Clonetics, San Diego, CA); or in F12K (PC-3; Cellgro). The melanoma cell line WM-164 was obtained from Dr. Meenhard Herlyn at the Wistar Institute (Philadelphia, PA) and maintained as previously described (20Maeshima Y. Colorado P.C. Kalluri R. J. Biol.

A suspension of C-PAE cells (7,000 cells/well, passage 2–6) in DMEM containing 0.5% FCS was added onto 96-well plates precoated with fibronectin (Sigma, 10 μg/ml). After 24 h, medium was replaced with DMEM containing 20% FCS and recombinant Tum-5. Then, after 36–48 h, methylene blue staining was performed as previously described (5Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H. Ramchandran R. Torre A. Maeshima Y. Mier J.W. Sukhatme V.P. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1209-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Polymyxin B (Sigma, 5 μg/ml) was used to inactivate any endotoxin that was still present (28Liu S. Tobias R. McClure S. Styba G. Shi Q. Jackowski G. Clin Biochem. 1997; 30: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), although all samples tested were less than 50 enzyme units/mg in endotoxin, a concentration that is not enough to affect endothelial cell growth (data not shown). WM-164 cells were analyzed using a similar protocol. The BrdUrd incorporation assay was conducted using the BrdUrd proliferation assay kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Calbiochem) with some modifications. Briefly, C-PAE cells were seeded onto 96-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FCS. The next day the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2% FCS with or without Tum-5 or full-length tumstatin (293 cell expressed). The plates were then incubated for 46 h at which time cells were pulsed for 2 h with BrdUrd (10 nm). The cells/DNA were then fixed to the wells, reacted with anti-BrdUrd primary and secondary antibodies and then developed using a colorimetric reaction. The plates were read atA450 nm on a Molecular Devices plate reader. All groups represent triplicate samples. Cell viability was assessed by MTT (Chemicon) assay according to manufacturer instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with some modifications. C-PAE cells (5,000 cells/well) were plated in a 96-well plate in DMEM containing 5% FCS. The next day, Tum-5 was added and incubated for 24 or 48 h, and cell viability was evaluated as previously described (7Maeshima Y. Colorado P.C. Torre A. Holthaus K.A. Grunkemeyer J.A.

C-PAE cells were plated onto 96-well plates and serum-depleted as described above. Tum-5 (final concentration, 20 μg/ml) was incubated with varying concentrations of human αvβ3 integrin protein (Chemicon) for 30 min at room temperature, and the mixture was added onto the cells and incubated for 48 h. Proliferation assays were performed using the methylene blue staining method as previously described (5Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H. Ramchandran R. Torre A. Maeshima Y. Mier J.W.

In experiments with anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody, cells were plated and preincubated with the antibody for 1 h before Tum-5 (final concentration, 20 μg/ml) was added. C-PAE cells were growth arrested by contact inhibition for 48 h. The 0 h value refers to the percentage of cells in S phase at this time point. The cells (0.1 × 106/well) were harvested and plated into a 12-well plate coated with fibronectin in 5% FCS and recombinant Tum-5 or Tum-5/126C-A. After 21 h, the cells were harvested and then fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol. The fixed cells were rehydrated at room temperature for 30 min in PBS containing 2% FCS and 0.1% Tween-20 and then centrifuged and resuspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer. RNase digestion (5 μg/ml) was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by staining with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml). The cells were analyzed using a Coulter EPICS XL-MCL flow cytometer. Annexin V, a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein with a high affinity for phosphatidylserine, was used to detect apoptosis (29van Engeland M. Nieland L.J. Ramaekers F.C. Schutte B. Reutelingsperger C.P. Cytometry. 1998; 31: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (0.5 × 106/well) were seeded onto a 6-well plate in DMEM containing 10% FCS. On the next day, fresh medium containing 10% FCS was added together with Tum-5 or 80 ng/ml of TNF-α. After 18 h of treatment, floating and attached cells were harvested and processed as described elsewhere (5Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H. Ramchandran R. Torre A. Maeshima Y.

Briefly, C-PAE cells (0.4 × 106/well) were plated in 60-mm Petri dishes precoated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml). Cells were serum-starved (2% FCS) for 24 h, and then cells were stimulated with basic fibroblast growth factor (3 ng/ml) in DMEM (2% FCS) also containing Tum-5 (10 μg/ml) and incubated for 24 h. Controls received PBS buffer. TNF-α (80 ng/ml) was used as a positive control. After 24 h, both the supernatant and attached cells were combined, and an equal number of cells (4 × 107 cells/ml) was processed following the manufacturer's instruction (CLONTECH). A specific inhibitor of caspase-3, DEVD-fmk was used for specificity. The absorbance was measured in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) at 405 nm. Similarly nonendothelial cells (PC-3) were used and analyzed. This assay was repeated three times. The endothelial tube formation assay was performed as previously described (7Maeshima Y.

Matrigel-precoated 96-well plates were used, and HUVECs (5,000 cells/well) were seeded in the presence of Tum-5 or human endostatin. Control cells were incubated with PBS. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, and the number of tubes was counted using a microscope (magnification of 3.3× ocular, 10× objective). Three wells were viewed, and the number of tubes/well was counted and averaged by two investigators blinded for the experimental protocols.

Plates were blocked with 100 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 2 h. HUVECs or C-PAEs (1.5 × 105 cells/ml, in M-199) were incubated with either 10 μg/ml of antibody or synthetic peptide for 15 min. Then, 100 μl of the cell suspension/well was added onto the plates and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. After washing, the number of attached cells was determined with methylene blue staining. Control mouse IgG1 and mouse monoclonal antibody to human β1integrin (clone P4C10) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Monoclonal antibody to human αvβ3 integrin (clone LM609) was purchased from Chemicon. Direct ELISA was performed as described previously (31Kalluri R. Shield C.F. Todd P. Hudson B.G. Neilson E.G. J.

Tumstatin (293 cell expressed) or Tum-5 was coated onto a 96-well plate in triplicate (100 ng/well), and an equal molar amount of binding protein αvβ3 integrin (Chemicon) was added. Binding was established with monoclonal antibodies to αvβ3 integrin (clone LM609, Chemicon). The ELISA was developed with an alkaline phosphatase secondary antibody and read in a plate reader at absorbance of 405 nm. In vivo Matrigel plug assay was performed as previously described (7Maeshima Y. Colorado P.C. Torre A. Holthaus K.A. Grunkemeyer J.A. Ericksen M.D. Hopfer H. Xiao Y. Stillman I.E. Kalluri R. J. Biol.

All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the animal care and use committee of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and are in accordance with the guidelines of the Department of Health and Human Services. Matrigel (Collaborative Biomolecules) was mixed with 20 units/ml of heparin (Pierce), 50 ng/ml of vascular endothelial growth factor (R&D), and 5 μg/ml of Tum-5 or 10 μg/ml of Tum-1. The control group did not receive recombinant proteins. The Matrigel mixture was injected subcutaneously, and after 6 days mice were sacrificed, and the Matrigel plugs were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The plugs were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and hematoxylin and eosin stained. Sections were examined by light microscopy, and the number of blood vessels from 4–7 high power fields (×400) were counted and averaged. All sections were coded and observed by an investigator who was blinded for study protocols. Each group consists of four Matrigel plugs. Male athymic nude NCRNU mice, 5–6 weeks old, weighing ∼25 g were implanted with 2 × 106 PC-3 cells into the dorsal subcutis. The tumors were measured using Vernier calipers, and the volume was calculated using the standard formula (width2 × length × 0.52) (3O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M.

The tumors were allowed to grow to ∼50 mm3, and animals were then pair-matched into groups of 6 mice. Initial doses were given on the day of pair-matching (Day 1). Tum-5, Tum-5/126C-A, or human endostatin was intraperitoneally injected twice daily at doses ranging from 1–20 mg/kg for 20 days in sterile PBS. Only soluble proteins were used. In addition, continuous delivery using Alzetmini-pumps surgically implanted subcutaneously were used in one treatment (Tum-5) group. Mice were weighed twice weekly, and tumor measurements were taken twice weekly, starting on Day 1. Estimated mean tumor volumes were plotted as a ratio (V/Vo), where V = tumor volume on day of measurement and Vo = initial tumor volume. Upon termination (Day 21), the mice were weighed and sacrificed, and their tumors were excised and examined by light microscopy and CD31 immunostaining. In this model, (the mean treated tumor weight)/(mean control tumor weight) × 100% was subtracted from 100% to give the tumor growth inhibition for each group. In all experiments, the control group received vehicle injection. Intratumoral microvessel density (MVD) was analyzed on frozen sections of PC-3 tumor xenografts using a rat anti-mouse CD-31 monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) with a standard streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase detection system (Vectastain ABC Elite kit). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using 1% H2O2/methanol for 30 min, and slides were then subjected to antigen retrieval by incubating with proteinase K for 30 min at room temperature. Anti-mouse CD31 antibody was diluted 1:20 in PBS-T (PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20) and incubated for 2 h after sections were blocked with 5% normal goat serum/PBS-T. Normal rat IgG was used as a negative control. Immunoperoxidase staining was carried out utilizing the Vectastain ABC Elite reagent kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Sections were counterstained with Methyl green. MVD was assessed at first by scanning the tumor at low power, then identifying three areas at the tumor periphery that contain the maximum number of discrete microvessels, and then counting individual microvessels on a lower magnification (40×) field. The mean microvessel density was compared among treatment groups and analyzed using Student's t test. All values are expressed as means ± S.E. Analysis of variance with a one-tailed Student's ttest was used to identify significant differences in multiple comparisons. A level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Tum-5 was produced as a fusion protein with a C-terminal 6-histidine tag in E. coliusing the expression plasmid pET 28a and in yeast using plasmid pPICZαA. Tum-5 was expressed to encompass amino acids 45–132 to include the putative amino acids 54–132 anti-angiogenic domain of tumstatin. The E. coli expressed protein was isolated predominantly as soluble protein after a refolding process, and SDS-PAGE"
https://openalex.org/W2056817403,"Transcript expression of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at high salinity was determined by microarray analysis of 6144 open reading frames (ORFs). From cells grown in 1 m NaCl for 10, 30, and 90 min, changes in transcript abundance >2-fold were classified. Salinity-induced ORFs increased over time: 107 (10 min), 243 (30 min), and 354 (90 min). Up-regulated, functionally unknown ORFs increased from 17 to 149 over this period. Expression patterns were similar early, with 67% of up-regulated transcripts after 10 min identical to those at 30 min. The expression profile after 90 min revealed different up-regulated transcripts (identities of 13% and 22%, respectively). Nucleotide and amino acid metabolism exemplified the earliest responses to salinity, followed by ORFs related to intracellular transport, protein synthesis, and destination. Transcripts related to energy production were up-regulated throughout the time course with respiration-associated transcripts strongly induced at 30 min. Highly expressed at 90 min were known salinity stress-induced genes, detoxification-related responses, transporters of the major facilitator superfamily, metabolism of energy reserves, nitrogen and sulfur compounds, and lipid, fatty acid/isoprenoid biosynthesis. We chose severe stress conditions to monitor responses in essential biochemical mechanisms. In the mutant, Deltagpd1/gpd2, lacking glycerol biosynthesis, the stress response was magnified with a partially different set of up-regulated ORFs."
https://openalex.org/W1561751527,"Matrix GLA protein (MGP) is ubiquitously expressed with high accumulation in bone and cartilage, where it was found to associate with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) during protein purification. To test whether MGP affects BMP-induced differentiation, three sets of experiments were performed. First, pluripotent C3H10T1/2 cells transfected with human MPG (hMGP) or antisense to hMGP (AS-hMGP) were treated with BMP-2. In cells overexpressing hMGP, osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation was inhibited indicating decreased BMP-2 activity. Conversely, in cells overexpressing AS-hMGP, BMP-2 activity was enhanced. Second, cells were prepared from homozygous and heterozygous MPG-deficient mice aortas. When treated with BMP-2, these cells underwent chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation, respectively, whereas controls did not. Third, FLAG-tagged hMGP with the same biological effect as native hMGP inhibited BMP-induced differentiation, when exogenously added to culture media. Together, these results suggest that MGP modulates BMP activity. To test whether hMGP fragments would retain the effect of full-length hMGP, three subdomains were overexpressed in C3H10T1/2 cells. In cells expressing the mid-region, alone (amino acids (aa) 35–54) or in combination with the N terminus (aa 1–54) butnot the C terminus (aa 35–84), osteogenic differentiation was enhanced and occurred even without added BMP-2. Thus, two subdomains had the opposite effect of full-length hMGP, possibly due to different expression levels or domain characteristics.

Thus, two subdomains had the opposite effect of full-length hMGP, possibly due to different expression levels or domain characteristics. Matrix GLA protein (MGP)1 is a small ubiquitous matrix protein containing carboxyglutamic acid (GLA) (calculated mass of mature protein 10.4 kDa), initially isolated from bone and characterized by Price et al. (1Price P.A. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1985; 260: 14971-14975Google Scholar). Results from other investigators suggest that MGP affects differentiation in developing cartilage and bone. Luo et al. (2Luo G. D'Souza R. Hogue D. Karsenty G. J. Bone Miner. Res... 1995; 10: 325-334Google Scholar) observed that MGP is expressed in early and late stages of chondrogenic differentiation but not in the intermediate stage. Yagami et al. (3Yagami K. Suh J.-O. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Koyama E. Abrams W.R. Shapiro I.M. Pacifici M. Iwamoto M. J. Cell Biol... 1999; 147: 1097-1108Google Scholar) found that MGP had an effect on mineralization in chondrocytes that was dependent on cell stage; it affected mineralization in hypertrophic chondrocytes but not in proliferative chondrocytes. They also found that overexpression of MGP in developing limb buds delayed chondrocyte maturation and blocked endochondral ossification. In MGP null (MGP−/−) mice (4Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature.. 1997; 386: 78-81Google Scholar), the epiphyseal growth plates of bones showed inappropriate calcification in the layer of proliferating chondrocytes that failed to differentiate into hypertrophic chondrocytes. In addition, the mice unexpectedly developed severe vascular calcification, resulting from a replacement of the aortic medial layer by chondrocyte-like cells, producing a typical cartilage matrix that progressively calcified. When Urist and colleagues (5Urist M.R. Huo Y.K. Brownell A.G. Hohl W.M. Buyske J. Lietze A. Tempst P. Hunkapiller M. DeLange R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1984; 81: 371-375Google Scholar) first discovered bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), they observed a tight association with MGP in vitro during protein purification requiring strong denaturants to break. Although complex formation was not shown in vivo orin situ, it was suggested that MGP may sequester BMP in bone tissue and as such regulate its activity (5Urist M.R. Huo Y.K. Brownell A.G. Hohl W.M. Buyske J. Lietze A. Tempst P. Hunkapiller M. DeLange R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1984; 81: 371-375Google Scholar). Since BMP mediates its biological response through a cell surface receptor, MGP could potentially act extracellularly to form an inactive complex with BMP. It has not been shown whether MPG affects BMP function by forming such a biologically inactive complex whose formation blocks BMP action on cells. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that the mechanism for the effect of MGP on cell differentiation is through modulation of BMP activity. A useful model for assaying BMP-2 functional activity in mesenchymal differentiation is the “undifferentiated” mesenchymal cell line, C3H10T1/2. These multipotent mouse embryonic cells, also known as vascular precursor cells (6Hirschi K.K. Rohovsky S.A. D'Amore P.A. J. Cell Biol... 1998; 141: 805-814Google Scholar), differentiate along adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages when stimulated with BMP-2 (7Wang E.A. Israel D.I. Kelly S. Luxenberg D.P.

Once stimulated, colonies of lineage form within the same culture and time frame. To test the hypothesis that MGP modulates BMP-2-induced mesenchymal differentiation, we overexpressed human MGP (hMGP) and antisense to hMGP (AS-hMGP), and we assayed differentiation along each lineage in response to recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2). We also compared responses to rhBMP-2 in cells isolated from aortas of homozygous and heterozygous MGP-deficient mice to those isolated from aortas of wild-type mice. FLAG-tagged hMGP with the same biological effect as native hMGP was used to localize the MGP effect to the extracellular space. In addition, the effect of overexpression of selected hMGP subdomains was compared with that of full-length hMGP. These results support the concept that MGP modulates BMP activity in mesenchymal differentiation and that the physical interaction observed during protein purification from bone may have physiological significance. Full-length human MGP (hMGP) cDNA subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pBSSK(−) plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) (9Kiefer M.C. Bauer D.M. Young D. Hermsen K.M. Masiarz F.R. Barr P.J. Nucleic Acids Res... 1988; 16: 5213Google Scholar). The hMGP sequence was excised and subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) Zeo (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in sense or antisense orientation using the HindIII andXbaI sites for sense orientation, and the NotI and ApaI sites for antisense orientation. A schematic overview of the vectors used in this study is provided in Fig.1. To construct the N-MGP vector (containing the N-terminal and the central region of hMGP, aa 1–54, Fig. 1), the correct fragment was generated by PCR of hMGP cDNA using primers ERIFL-5′ and MGPX-3′ (Table I) and then subcloned into theEcoRI and XbaI sites in the pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid after digestion of the restriction enzyme sites in the primers. To construct the mid-MGP vector (containing the central region of hMGP alone, aa 35–54, Fig. 1), the C-MGP vector (containing the C-terminal and the central region of hMGP, aa 35–84, Fig. 1), and the control vector (containing only the leader sequence, Fig. 1), the hMGP-leader sequence was first excised from the hMGP cDNA usingEcoRI and a HinfI site located just downstream of the leader sequence. Fragments containing the C-MGP and the mid-MGP regions were generated by PCR of hMGP cDNA using primers MGPH-5′ and XBAFL-3′, and MGPH-5′ and MGPX-3′ (Table I) respectively. The fragments were subsequently ligated into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector downstream of and in frame with the leader sequence, after digestion of the restriction enzyme sites in the PCR primers. For the control vector, the EcoRI-HinfI fragment was ligated into pcDNA3.1(+) digested with EcoRI and EcoRV. This vector contains the leader sequence alone followed by a stop codon 1 base downstream of the HinfI site.Table IPrimer sequences for vector construction and RT-PCRTarget genePrimer sequencePosition (Ref.)Annealing TemperatureCycle No.1-aCycle numbers refer to the number of cycles used for RT-PCR for the respective primer pair.°CPrimers for vector construction1-bUnderlined sequences refer to the added enzyme sites.ERIFL-5′5′-ACGTGAATTCAGACTGACCTGCAGGA-3′ (EcoRI)24–39 (30Chen L.

Open table in a new tab To construct the FLAG-tagged hMGP vector, a fragment containing full-length hMGP in which the stop codon had been replaced by anXhoI site, was generated by PCR of hMGP cDNA using primers ERIFL-5′ and mgpFLAG-3′ (Table I). The FLAG tag was placed in the C terminus of the resulting protein by subcloning the fragment into the EcoRI and XhoI sites in the pCMV-Tag4 plasmid (Stratagene), after digestion of the restriction enzyme sites in the primers. To construct the human BMP-2 vector, the correct fragment containing the complete coding sequence was generated by PCR of human BMP-2 cDNA using primers bmp2ERI-5′ and bmp2XBA-3′ (Table I), and then subcloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites in the pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid, after digestion of the restriction enzyme sites in the primers. All constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing of the complete coding sequences. C3H10T1/2 mouse cells were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium with Earle's salt (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) and HEK293 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific), both supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mmol/L), andl-glutamine (2 mm). To prepare aortic cells from MGP-deficient and control mice, whole aortas were obtained and cleaned of visible surrounding fat and other tissue. Aortic cells from heterozygous MGP+/− and normal mice were prepared by enzymatic digestions with cold trypsin as described previously (10Freshney R.I. in Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Techniques,.Wiley-Liss, Inc.,. 1987; : 115-118Google Scholar). Because of cartilaginous metaplasia, homozygous MGP−/− aortas required use of enzymatic digestion adapted to cartilage as described previously (10Freshney R.I. in Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Techniques,.Wiley-Liss, Inc.,. 1987; : 115-118Google Scholar) for release of cells. After digestion, the cells were plated in gelatin-coated 12-well plates and grown in F-12 medium (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mmol/liter), and l-glutamine (2 mm). The MGP−/− cells did not tolerate subsequent trypsinization and re-plating and thus were treated with rhBMP-2 as they reached ∼75% confluency. Cells from normal mice and MGP+/− mice were trypsinized, plated, and treated with rhBMP-2 as they reached ∼75% confluency. Treatment with rhBMP-2 was continued for a total of 14–16 days. The cells were then taken to histochemical staining, RT-PCR, or immunoblotting. Transfections were performed using SuperfectTM (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), after optimization of the ratio of DNA to transfection agent as per manufacturer's instructions. Stable, mixed mass transfectants of C3H10T1/2 cells were selected and maintained by adding ZeocinTM (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 500 ng/ml to all culture media. Recombinant human BMP-2 was graciously supplied by Genetics Institute or generated in our laboratory from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the human BMP-2 vector. The concentration of rhBMP-2 in undiluted conditioned media was estimated by comparison with purified rhBMP-2 from Genetics Institute using Western blotting. Two thousand C3H10T1/2 cells were plated in 60-mm Petri dishes, or 150 cells were plated per well in 12-well plates. BMP-2 was added to the cultures the day after plating at a concentration of 500 ng/ml. Because of the sparse plating, the initial medium with rhBMP-2 was left on the cells for 7 days; thereafter, the medium was changed every 3–4 days for a total of 21 days. Cells in 60-mm Petri dishes were used for RT-PCR, immunoblotting, or immunoradiometric assay; cells in 12-well plates were used for histochemical staining. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using an RNA isolation kit (Stratagene). Reverse transcription of 3 μg of total RNA was carried out for 90 min at 37 °C in 50 μl of RT buffer (as supplied by Stratagene), supplemented with 0.5 mm of each dNTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 50–80 units of RNase Block, 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (both Stratagene), and 750 ng of oligo(dT) (10Freshney R.I. in Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Techniques,.Wiley-Liss, Inc.,. 1987; : 115-118Google Scholar) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for priming. PCR using primers to unique sequences in each cDNA was carried out in a volume of 10 μl, using Pfu buffer, 7 units of nativePfu polymerase (Stratagene), 0.1 μl of [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 25 ng of each primer, and 1 μl of template (from a 50-μl RT reaction). Thermal cycling was performed as follows: 1) initial denaturation at 96 °C for 2 min; 2) cycling for cDNA-specific number of cycles (Table I) between 96 °C for 1 min, cDNA-specific annealing temperature (Table I) for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; and 3) final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. For semi-quantitative PCR, the number of cycles was chosen so that amplification remained well within the linear range, as assessed by densitometry (NIH Image J, version 1.08i, public domain program) of standard curves for representative samples. An equal volume from each PCR was analyzed by 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and dried gels were examined by autoradiography. For PCR generating DNA fragments for vector construction, the number of cycles was chosen to ensure sufficient amounts of generated product, usually 45 cycles. Cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates at 100 cells per well. Sixteen hours later, 200 μl of conditioned media containing rhBMP-2 (estimated 600 ng/ml) alone or in combination with ∼3-fold molar excess hMGP-FLAG was applied to the cultures. The initial medium was left on the cells for 6 days; thereafter, the medium was changed every 3–4 days for a total of 13–14 days. Conditioned media containing either BMP-2 or hMGP-FLAG alone were prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with 16 μg of the respective plasmid per 100-mm culture dish. Conditioned media containing both BMP-2 and hMGP-FLAG were prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with 4 and 12 μg of the BMP-2 and the hMGP-FLAG plasmid, respectively, per 100-mm culture dish. In all cases, 5 ml of conditioned medium was collected after 48 h of incubation starting after transfection. Control media were collected form HEK293 cells transfected with empty vector. To determine AP activity, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by freeze-thawing twice in 50 μl of 0.2% Nonidet P-40 with 1 mm MgCl2. Cell lysates were assayed for AP activity by adding 150 μl of AP buffer (40 mg of Sigma 104 phosphate substrate dissolved in 20 ml of Sigma 221 Alkaline Buffer Solution diluted 1:2 with distilled water) per well and incubating for 60 min at 37 °C. Absorbance at 405 nm was read using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and activity was expressed as units per mg of cellular protein. Oil Red O, von Kossa, Alizarin Red, and Alcian Blue histochemical stains were performed using standard methods. Alkaline phosphatase stain was performed as described previously (11Balica M. Boström K. Shin V. Tillisch K. Demer L.L. Circulation.. 1997; 95: 1954-1960Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, 30 μg per sample of whole cell extract protein was electrophoresed through 3–8% NuPAGETM Tris acetate gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) or 4–12% NuPAGETM Bis-Tris (MOPS) gels for collagen IX and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ), respectively. For detection of FLAG-tagged hMGP and BMP-2 in conditioned media, 30 μl of media were electrophoresed through 10% NuPAGETM Bis-Tris (MES) gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filter using NuPAGETM Transfer buffer (NOVEX). The blots were incubated with specific antibodies to either collagen IX (monoclonal antibody MAB3304 (12Warman M. Kimura T. Muragaki Y. Castagnola P. Tamei H. Iwata K. Olsen B.R. Matrix.. 1993; 13: 149-156Google Scholar), Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml, PPAR-γ protein (polyclonal antibody H-100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, the FLAG tag (polyclonal antibody F7425, Sigma) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, or BMP-2 (polyclonal antibody H-51, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Specific antibody binding was visualized with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mouse osteocalcin was quantitated in undiluted conditioned culture medium after 4 days of incubation according to manufacturer's instructions using an immunoradiometric assay (Immutopics, San Clemente, CA), and the results were expressed as ng/ml. There was no cross-reactivity with bovine osteocalcin derived from FBS. To determine the effect of MGP on BMP-2-directed differentiation, we used low density cultures of the multipotent mouse mesenchymal cell line, C3H10T1/2 cells, which commit to various mesenchymal lineages when stimulated with exogenous BMP-2 (7Wang E.A.

Dyn... 1998; 213: 398-411Google Scholar), even after brief, transient exposures (7Wang E.A. Israel D.I. Kelly S. Luxenberg D.P. Growth Factors.. 1993; 9: 57-71Google Scholar). Without stimulation, there are low levels of spontaneous differentiation at base line (7Wang E.A. Israel D.I. Kelly S. Luxenberg D.P. Growth Factors.. 1993; 9: 57-71Google Scholar). We used these cells as a bioassay to study effects of MGP on BMP-2 response by varying MGP expression. MGP expression is highly dependent on cell density in cultured rat kidney (NRK) cells (13Cancela M.L. Hu B. Price P.A. J. Cell. Physiol... 1997; 171: 125-134Google Scholar); the expression at low density was barely detectable but increased significantly with culture density. We observed the same phenomenon in C3H10T1/2 cells, with barely detectable MGP expression 1 day after low density plating, increasing at least 12–13-fold after 3 weeks in culture. To test the hypothesis that MGP affects cell differentiation through altered responses to BMP-2, we modulated the MGP expression at low cell density (i.e. minimal expression of endogenous MGP) conditions, using stable cell lines overexpressing human MGP (hMGP) or antisense to MGP (AS-hMGP). We used the human MGP sequence that can be distinguished from mouse MGP using RT-PCR. One day after low density plating, cells transfected with hMGP had an estimated 3-fold increase in MGP signal (including both sense mouse and sense human MGP, Fig. 2). Also at low density, cells transfected with AS-hMGP had an estimated 3-fold increase in MGP signal (including both sense mouse andantisense human MGP, Fig. 2) compared with nontransfected control cells. Addition of BMP-2 in all experiments was performed at this low density state. To assess whether altered levels of MGP expression modulate BMP-2-induced differentiation, we established a differentiation assay in C3H10T1/2 cells following the methods of Wanget al. (7Wang E.A. Israel D.I. Kelly S. Luxenberg D.P. Growth Factors.. 1993; 9: 57-71Google Scholar). Treatment with rhBMP-2 or control vehicle was started at low density and continued for 21 days to allow distinct colonies of differentiated cells to form. We used rhBMP-2 at a concentration of 500 ng/ml based on preliminary experiments showing that this concentration induced differentiation in nontransfected C3H10T1/2 cells detectable by both specific cell markers and histochemical stains used to identify osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic cell differentiation. RT-PCRs for osteocalcin (14Celeste A.J. Rosen V. Buecker J.L. Kriz R. Wang E.A. Wozney J.M. EMBO J... 1986; 5: 1885-1890Google Scholar) in combination with von Kossa and Alizarin Red stains were used to identify osteogenic differentiation, RT-PCR for collagen IX (15Kolettas E. Buluwela L. Bayliss M.T. Muir H.I. J. Cell Sci... 1995; 108: 1991-1999Google Scholar), and Alcian Blue stain to identify chondrogenic differentiation, RT-PCR for PPAR-γ (16Cowherd R.M. Lyle R.E. McGehee Jr., R.E. Cell. Dev. Biol... 1999; 10: 3-10Google Scholar), and Oil Red O stain to identify adipogenic differentiation. The response to BMP-2 differed with the transfected construct. Nontransfected cells at low density underwent differentiation into a mix of all three cell lineages with cells of each lineage grouped in colonies as expected. No difference was seen between nontransfected cells and control cells transfected with plasmid containing only the MGP-leader sequence. However, in cultures of cells overexpressing hMGP, BMP-2-induced differentiation was inhibited. Conversely, in cultures overexpressing AS-hMGP, osteogenesis and chondrogenesis were enhanced. These effects were first evident in phenotypic changes. Cells overexpressing hMGP maintained a noninduced phenotype despite BMP-2 treatment (Fig. 3, middle panels). In contrast, even without BMP-2 treatment, AS-hMGP-expressing cells spontaneously underwent these phenotypic changes (Fig. 3, bottom panels). In hMGP-overexpressing cells, cell-specific markers, osteocalcin and collagen IX, were inhibited based on semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig.4). In fact, both osteocalcin and collagen IX expression showed a decreasing trend in BMP-2-treated cells. In contrast, in AS-hMGP-overexpressing cells, osteocalcin expression increased about 2-fold, and collagen IX expression increased 4-fold compared with non- and control-transfected cells. Adipogenic differentiation appeared to be only partially inhibited in cells expressing hMGP based on only partial inhibition of PPAR-γ2. This may be due to the base-line expression of BMP-4 which induces adipogenic differentiation in these cells (17Butterwith S.C. Wilkie R.S. Clinton M. Biochem. Soc. Trans... 1996; 24: 163Google Scholar). To confirm the RT-PCR results, we performed immunoradiometric quantitation of mouse osteocalcin in cell media (Fig.5, upper panel) and immunoblotting for PPAR-γ protein and collagen IX (Fig. 5,lower panel). These results were consistent with the findings of the RT-PCR. The antibody for PPAR-γ protein recognizes both PPAR-γ1, which is widely expressed in a variety of cells (16Cowherd R.M. Lyle R.E. McGehee Jr., R.E. Cell. Dev. Biol... 1999; 10: 3-10Google Scholar), and PPAR-γ2. PPAR-γ2 contains 28 extra amino acids at the N terminus (16Cowherd R.M. Lyle R.E. McGehee Jr., R.E. Cell. Dev. Biol... 1999; 10: 3-10Google Scholar) (∼3.5 kDa) and thus corresponds to the upper band. Nonquantitative histochemical stainings (Fig.6) further confirmed an inhibition of osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation in hMGP-overexpressing cells. As expected, Oil Red O staining showed occasional adipocytes (Fig. 6, left middle panel). Positive staining for all lineages was seen in nontransfected control cells and in AS-hMGP-overexpressing cells. Thus, in cells overexpressing hMGP, BMP-2 activity was reduced, and in cells overexpressing AS-hMGP, BMP-2 activity was increased. To test our results ex vivo, mixed aortic cells from homozygous MGP−/− and heterozygous MGP+/− mice as well as wild-type controls were harvested and cultured. The cells were treated with rhBMP-2 at a concentration of 500 ng/ml for 14–16 days. When MGP−/− cells were treated with BMP-2, chondrogenic differentiation was induced based on strong induction of alkaline phosphatase in colonies of rounded cells (Fig.7 A) and formation of distinct colonies of chondrocytes producing acidic mucopolysaccharides (18Asahina I. Sampath T.K. Nishimura I. Hauschka P.V. J. Cell Biol... 1993; 123: 921-933Google Scholar) (Fig. 7 A). In MGP+/− or control +/+ cells, BMP-2 failed to induce chondrogenic differentiation based on histochemical staining, as well as RT-PCR and immunoblotting for collagen IX (data not shown). However, in MGP+/− cells, BMP-2 did induce osteogenic differentiation based on mineral formation and increased osteocalcin expression (Fig.7, B and C). Although a low level of osteocalcin expression was found at base line in wild-type cells, this showed a decreasing trend with BMP-2. The differential effect may be the result of a changed ratio of MGP relative to BMP-2 resulting in relatively unopposed BMP activity. These results differ from those in C3H10T1/2 cells, in that osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation in mouse cells appeared to be confined to heterozygous or homozygous cells, respectively. It is possible that the C3H10T1/2 cells are less differentiated than the isolated vascular cells, retaining a higher degree of pluripotentiality. Equally possible is that cell isolation procedures and/or culture conditions select for certain types of cells resulting in the observed differences. In the experiments described above, mRNA levels of MGP were modulated by overexpression of hMGP or AS-hMGP or by using cells from MGP-deficient mice. Even though mRNA levels most commonly reflect protein levels, this may not always be the case. To determine directly the effect of MGP protein on BMP-induced differentiation, we tagged the C-terminal end of hMGP for easy detection in conditioned media (Fig.8 A, inset), and we compared the response to BMP-2 of C3H10T1/2 cells expressing hMGP-FLAG with those expressing nontagged hMGP. No significant difference was detected, here demonstrated by comparing BMP-2-induced alkaline phosphatase activity, an early marker for osteoblastic and chondrocytic differentiation (Fig. 8 A). These results indicate that MGP protein is secreted by the transfected cells and that the experimentally tagged protein retains the function of the original MGP. Nontransfected C3H10T1/2 cells were then treated with conditioned media containing BMP-2 alone or in combination with ∼3-fold molar excess hMGP-FLAG. Conditioned media containing BMP-2 (Fig. 8 B, inset) or hGMP-FLAG was prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with expression vectors of BMP-2 or hMGP-FLAG. Condi"
https://openalex.org/W1971656831,"Heat shock transcription factor 2 (HSF2) is a transcription factor that regulates heat shock protein gene expression, but the mechanisms regulating the function of this factor are unclear. Here we report that HSF2 is a substrate for modification by the ubiquitin-related protein SUMO-1 and that HSF2 colocalizes in cells with SUMO-1 in nuclear granules. Staining with anti-promyelocytic leukemia antibodies indicates that these HSF2-containing nuclear granules are PML bodies. Our results identify lysine 82 as the major site of SUMO-1 modification in HSF2, which is located in a ""wing"" within the DNA-binding domain of this protein. Interestingly, SUMO-1 modification of HSF2 results in conversion of this factor to the active DNA binding form. This is the first demonstration that SUMO-1 modification can directly alter the DNA binding ability of a transcription factor and reveals a new mechanism by which SUMO-1 modification can regulate protein function."

Early in the disease process CF patients often have intermittent airway infection because of Staphylococcus aureus, followed byPseudomonas aeruginosa infection, which eventually becomes chronic. These infections are associated with an excessive inflammatory response, characterized by the accumulation of large amounts of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) chemokine IL-8, as well as PMNs and their toxic products in the airways (1Konstan M.W.

Cells with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutations, as well as damaged or regenerating epithelial cells, express increased numbers of asialylated glycolipids such as asialoGM1 (5Saiman L.

The binding of asialoGM1 on airway epithelial cells by P. aeruginosa stimulates nuclear translocation of NF-κB and activates transcription of IL-8 (9DiMango E. Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Tabibi S. Prince A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2598-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the major airway chemokine in the lung for PMNs, initiating the epithelial immune response to this pathogen. This response can be stimulated by intactP. aeruginosa, the isolated P. aeruginosa adhesin type IV pilin, or by an antibody to the pilin receptor asialoGM1 (9DiMango E. Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Tabibi S. Prince A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2598-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,10DiMango E. Zar H.J. Bryan R. Prince A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2204-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms involved in bacterial induction of epithelial cell signaling have been examined for several mucosal pathogens. Pathogenic Neisseria, which also express type IV pili, but not pil mutants, activate cervical epithelial cell lines by increasing [Ca2+]i through an interaction with CD46 (11Kallstrom H. Islam M.S. Berggren P.O. Jonsson A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21777-21782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ increase is because of influx associated with the translocation of a Neisserialporin into the eukaryotic cells and induces apoptosis, which accompanies Neisseria invasion of these epithelial cells (12Muller A. Gunther D. Dux F. Naumann M. Meyer T.F. Rudel T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Invasive pathogens in the gut such as Salmonella also stimulate NF-κB-dependent gene expression through Ca2+-dependent signaling (13Gewirtz A.T. Rao A.S. Simon Jr., P.O. Merlin D. Carnes D. Madara J.L. Neish A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, airway epithelial cells with intact tight junctions are highly resistant to bacterial invasion (14Lee A. Chow D. Haus B. Tseng W. Evans D. Fleiszig S. Chandy G. Machen T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L204-L217PubMed Google Scholar) and apoptosis (15Rajan S. Cacalano G. Bryan R. Ratner A.J. Sontich C.U. van Heerckeren A. Davis P. Prince A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In diseases such as CF in which there is prominent stimulation of epithelial cytokine expression (1Konstan M.W. Hilliard K.A. Norvell T.M. Berger M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), the bacterial burden is clearly in the airway lumen and not intracellular (4Pier G.B. Grout M. Zaidi T.S. Olsen J.C. Johnson L.G. Yankaskas J.R. Goldberg J.B. Science. 1996; 271: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), indicating that superficial interactions between specific bacterial gene products and epithelial receptors are sufficient to activate epithelial cell signaling. There is ample evidence that epithelial cells express IL-8 in response to a variety of pulmonary pathogens through NF-κB-dependent transcription. However, the more proximal components of the epithelial cell signaling cascade, the nature of the receptor, and the kinases involved in signal transduction have not been previously characterized. As perturbation of airway epithelial cells by various stimuli can initiate Ca2+ oscillations (16Evans J.H. Sanderson M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L30-L41PubMed Google Scholar) we postulated that bacterial ligands might activate epithelial responses by stimulating alterations in [Ca2+]i and causing activation of Ca2+-dependent kinases. In the studies presented, we sought to determine whether the common pulmonary pathogens S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, which are known to recognize asialylated glycolipid receptors, stimulate epithelial proinflammatory responses by the activation of a common pathway and to identify the components of the major signaling cascades involved. We demonstrate that these organisms, but not mutants lacking specific adhesins that ligate asialoGM1 moieties on the epithelial surface, generate increases in Ca2+ from intracellular stores to activate MAPKs, stimulate NF-κB translocation, and initiate IL-8 production. 1HAEo− cells, SV40 immortalized human airway epithelial cells whose properties have been well characterized (9DiMango E. Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Tabibi S. Prince A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2598-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), obtained from D. Gruenert (University of California, San Francisco, CA) were grown in 96-well plates in DMEM-F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 4 μg/ml amphotericin B. 9HTEo− cells were obtained from P. Davis (Case Western Reserve University) and grown in 6-well plates in DMEM-F-12 as above. Unless specified, reagents were purchased from Sigma. CHO-K1 cells obtained from ATCC were grown in DMEM + 10% FCS. PAO1, a motile, piliated, nonmucoid strain of P. aeruginosa, whose genome has been sequenced, was grown in M9 or LB media. PAOalgC has a mutation blocking phosphoglucomutase expression that results in defective LPS and alginate biosynthesis (17Coyne Jr., M.J. Russell K.S. Coyle C.L. Goldberg J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3500-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PAO/NP (pilA) lacks expression of pilin (10DiMango E. Zar H.J. Bryan R. Prince A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2204-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar).S. aureus strains RN6390 and RN6911 (agr) were grown in CYGP media and diluted as above (18Booth M.C. Cheung A.L. Hatter K.L. Jett B.D. Callegan M.C. Gilmore M.S. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subconfluent monolayers of 1HAEo− airway epithelial cells grown on glass coverslips were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 0.02% pluronic acid at room temperature for 45 min and then washed twice with PBS. Ratiometric imaging with excitation at wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm was done using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope and analyzed using VPROBE software. Frames were collected at 6-s intervals following the application of bacteria. Recordings were monitored from 10 cells/field, and at least five fields were examined for each condition. Binding competition assays were done using 1HAEo− cells grown to confluence in 96-well plates (9DiMango E. Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Tabibi S. Prince A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2598-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wells in quintuplicate were incubated with 2 × 108cfu/ml 35S-labeled PAO1 plus unlabeled organisms (P. aeruginosa or S. aureus in 5-fold excess). After a 60-min incubation the monolayers were washed three times in PBS and solubilized in 0.2% NaOH, and scintillations were counted. Binding competition studies in the presence of anti-asialoGM1 were done by incubating the monolayers with bacteria in DMEM + 0.1% bovine serum albumin with or without rabbit polyclonal antibody to 270 μg/ml asialoGM1 (anti-asialoGM1) (Wako, Richmond, VA) or with monoclonal anti-human epithelial antigen (250 μg/ml) (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Assays using S. aureus were done in the presence of 0.1% FCS. IL-8 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) following a 60-min exposure of confluent monolayers of 1HAEo− cells, weaned from serum for 24 h, in 96-well plates to 1–4 × 108 cfu/ml of the various bacterial strains preincubated for 60 min with the reagents indicated (9DiMango E. Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Tabibi S. Prince A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2598-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were washed and sterilized with gentamicin, and supernatants were harvested either 4 or 18 h later for IL-8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Duplicate wells were treated with trypan blue to assess epithelial viability during the assay, which was >75%. Assays using S. aureus were done in the presence of 0.1% FCS. Each IL-8 or luciferase data point was determined in quintuplicate, a mean and standard deviation was calculated, and statistical significance was evaluated using a one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's post test (GraphPad Instat version 3.00; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to test the null hypothesis that there was no difference in the amount of the outcome variable (IL-8 production or luciferase units) under each test condition as compared with the untreated control. For bacterial binding studies, means and standard deviations were compared using an unpaired, two-tailed t test. Epithelial cells grown in 6-well plates to 90% confluence were weaned from serum overnight. The cells were stimulated with thapsigargin, P. aeruginosa PAO1, orS. aureus (in DMEM + 0.1% FCS) for the time intervals indicated, washed, and lysed by the addition of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 45 min. Aliquots of the cell lysates (5–20 μg of protein) were combined with 4× NuPage (Novex, San Diego, CA) sample and reducing agent and heated to 70 °C for 10 min. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on SDS polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked in 5% skim milk overnight. Immunodetection was done with mouse monoclonal anti-phosphorylated or anti-nonphosphorylated p44/42 ERK1/2 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phosphorylated p38 MAPK (Tyr-180/Tyr-182), or anti-actin (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). An anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used as the secondary antibody and detected with Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). 1HAEo− cells were grown in 6-well plates to 80–90% confluence, washed once with PBS, and replated with serum and antibiotic free DMEM-F-12. Cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), 1 ng of plasmid DNA of pNF-κB-luciferase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which contains five NF-κB binding sites upstream of a luciferase reporter gene, and a constitutively active pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) to control for transfection efficiency and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 18 h. Cells were washed twice, and selected wells were pretreated with 5 μm BAPTA/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and resuspended in serum and antibiotic free DMEM-F-12 for 1 h. Cells were stimulated with antibody to asialoGM1 (100 μg/ml), 15 μm thapsigargin, or 108 cfu/ml of PAO1 in serum and antibiotic free DMEM-F-12 for 2 h or with S. aureus RN6390 in DMEM-F-12 + 0.1% FCS, washed, lysed, and harvested using passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase assays were performed using the reagents and protocol for the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and analyzed with a luminometer. After standardization for transfection efficiency, data were plotted as the mean of quadruplicate samples and are representative of at least two independent experiments. To directly demonstrate that asialoGM1 provides the required receptor to initiate NF-κB activation, CHO cells, which do not normally express apically exposed asialoGM1, were incubated with various concentrations of purified asialoGM1 (Fluka, Milwaukee, WI) for 2 h at 37 °C, and incorporation was demonstrated by flow cytometry using anti-aGM1 (100 μg/ml) as a primary antibody and goat anti-rabbit conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) as a secondary antibody. In subsequent experiments, CHO cells were incubated with 250 μm aGM1 for 2 h, transiently transfected with the NF-κB reporter system as above, and exposed to anti-aGM1 (100 μg/ml), 108 cfu/ml S. aureus, or 108 cfu/ml P. aeruginosa. Analysis of NF-κB activation was carried out as above. Experiments using S. aureus were performed in the presence of 0.1% FCS. Cellular responses to external stimuli often involve Ca2+-dependent signaling cascades. We tested the ability of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and corresponding mutant strains lacking genes expected to be involved in adherence to stimulate Ca2+ increases in human respiratory epithelial cells. The addition of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to Fura-2/AM-loaded 1HAEo− cells prompted a 100 nm rise in [Ca2+]i with return to baseline within 5 min (Fig. 1). Single cell recordings demonstrated that similar 100 nm increases in [Ca2+]i could be elicited by PAO1, anti-asialoGM1, or purified pilin, but not by the mutant PAO/NP (pilA), which does not recognize this receptor (5Saiman L. Prince A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1875-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) (Fig.2). Antibody recognition of human epithelial antigen on the cells did not elicit Ca2+ fluxes nor did purified P. aeruginosa LPS alone or in the presence of 0.1% serum. A PAO algC mutant that lacks phosphomannomutase activity required for both LPS and alginate synthesis (17Coyne Jr., M.J. Russell K.S. Coyle C.L. Goldberg J.B. J.

P. aeruginosa PAO1 and antibody to asialoGM1 also stimulated Ca2+ responses in respiratory epithelial cells derived from nasal polyps in primary culture (data not shown). S. aureus RN6390 activated Ca2+ fluxes of similar amplitude as PAO1 (Fig. 2 D) and was also able to initiate Ca2+ oscillations following the initial stimulus. The agr mutant RN6911 did not activate Ca2+fluxes. Representative tracings from single cells activated by anti-asialoGM1 demonstrate the cell to cell variations in the Ca2+ response (Fig. 2 E).Figure 2Spectrophotometric monitoring of Ca2+ transients in 1HAEo− cells loaded with Fura-2/AM and exposed to the stimuli indicated.

Zar H.J. Bryan R. Prince A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2204-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Although other adhesins are also expressed, pilin is the major ligand for this receptor and is responsible for much of the induction of IL-8 expression (5Saiman L. Prince A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1875-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). A dose-response relationship of the binding of P. aeruginosato cells with increasing amounts of surface asialoGM1 has been described (19Bryan R. Kube D. Perez A. Davis P. Prince A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, some data suggest that S. aureus might compete with P. aeruginosa for receptors on the surface of epithelial cells (20Imundo L. Barasch J. Prince A. Al-Awqati Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3019-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We postulated that the activation of Ca2+ responses by S. aureus, similarly, was because of ligation of the asialoGM1 receptor. Binding competition studies were done to see whether antibody to asialoGM1 inhibited bacterial attachment to airway epithelial cells and whetherP. aeruginosa could directly compete with S. aureus for epithelial binding. In the presence of anti-asialoGM1, 60% of PAO1 binding was displaced as compared with 40% of S. aureus RN6390 binding (p < 0.0002 andp < 0.004, respectively). Control assays done with the same concentration of antibody to human epithelial antigen resulted in no inhibition of binding by either species (data not shown). TheS. aureus agr mutant RN6911, which did not activate Ca2+ fluxes, was not displaced by antibody to asialoGM1. Radiolabeled P. aeruginosa PAO1 could be displaced byS. aureus RN6390 as effectively as by unlabeled PAO1 present in 5-fold excess. An equivalent inoculum of the S. aureusmutant RN6911 did not compete as efficiently suggesting that it has less affinity for common receptors. Labeled S. aureus was also able to compete with P. aeruginosa for binding (data not shown). Epithelial cells produce the PMN chemokine IL-8 in response to adherent P. aeruginosa through activation of NF-κB and transcription of the IL-8 gene (9DiMango E. Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Tabibi S. Prince A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2598-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10DiMango E. Zar H.J. Bryan R. Prince A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2204-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). S. aureus strains similarly stimulate IL-8 expression (Fig.3). The wild type S. aureusstrain RN6390 was associated with a greater IL-8 response than theagr mutant. To determine whether the activation of IL-8 expression is a direct consequence of [Ca2+]i release, epithelial cells were pretreated with reagents expected to alter Ca2+signaling prior to and during P. aeruginosastimulation, and IL-8 production was measured (Fig.4). Although chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA (21Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C404-C408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) did not inhibit IL-8 expression, epithelial cells pretreated with BAPTA/AM (22Unno N. Baba S. Fink M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G700-G708PubMed Google Scholar) to chelate intracellular Ca2+ had significantly decreased IL-8 responses (p < 0.001 for each). NiCl2, which functions as an external Ca2+ channel blocker (23Lagaud G.J.L. Randriamboavonjy V. Roul G. Stoclet J.C. Andriantsitohaina R. Am. J.

Compounds expected to affect Ca2+/calcineurin-dependent signaling pathways such as cyclosporin A (25Tomono M. Toyoshima K. Ito M. Amano H. Kiss Z. Arch. Biochem.

Airway epithelial cells treated with thapsigargin (27Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3001) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-dependent ATPase that transiently increases [Ca2+]i, or with okadaic acid, a PP2A phosphatase inhibitor that affects Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase activity (28Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), produced a dose-dependent increase in IL-8 production (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) (Fig. 4 B) suggesting that activation of IL-8 expression can be mediated solely through increases in [Ca2+]i. Many signaling cascades activate the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and other transcriptional activators involved in IL-8 transcription. NF-κB translocation can be initiated by Ca2+-dependent signals through the stimulation of MAPKs (29Enslen H. Tokumitsu H. Stork P.J. Davis R.J. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10803-10808Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We tested the involvement of two of the major families of MAPKs in the activation of IL-8 expression induced by ligation of the asialoGM1 receptor by bacteria or antibody (Fig.5). Stimulation of epithelial IL-8 expression by anti-asialoGM1 (Fig. 5 A), P. aeruginosa (Fig. 5 B), or S. aureus (Fig.5 C) was inhibited by either PD98059, a specific inhibitor of the MAPK/ERK1 kinase (30Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar). Inhibition of S. aureus stimulation of the cells by PD98059 and SB202190 was significant with p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively, and for all the other stimuli p < 0.001. Moreover, the Ca2+dependence of the IL-8 response was indicated by the ability of BAPTA/AM to significantly inhibit the induction of IL-8 by S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, or anti-asialoGM1 (p < 0.001 for each). To determine whether the proposed pathway is active in human airway epithelial cells in general, the kinetics of MAPK activation following exposure of an unrelated cell line to stimuli that increased [Ca2+]i and caused IL-8 production was examined. In lysates of 9HTEo− cells exposed to thapsigargin, phosphorylated ERK (p44/p42) was briefly detectable by Western hybridization within 15 min of stimulation and was gone by 30 min (Fig.6). Stimulation of the same cell line with P. aeruginosa also activated ERK1/2 briskly and transiently. 1HAEo− cells responded similarly to P. aeruginosa with phosphorylation of the p44/p42 ERK1/2 (Fig.7 A). In the presence of 0.1% FCS, which is required for staphylococcal binding, phosphorylated ERKs were detectable in unstimulated cells. There was a rapid response toS. aureus RN6390 with dephosphorylation of the ERK kinase, as compared with the total (phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated) p44/p42 kinase in the cell. Addition of anti-asialoGM1 to 1HAEo− cells resulted in more prolonged ERK1/2 phosphorylation persisting beyond 60 min, and thapsigargin also activated this kinase (Fig. 7 B). Phosphorylated p38 MAPK was induced following either P. aeruginosa or S. aureus exposur"

The helicase activity of eIF4A has been further characterized with respect to substrate specificity and directionality. Results confirm that the initial rate and amplitude of duplex unwinding by eIF4A is dependent on the overall stability, rather than the length or sequence, of the duplex substrate. eIF4A helicase activity is minimally dependent on the length of the single-stranded region adjacent to the double-stranded region of the substrate. Interestingly, eIF4A is able to unwind blunt-ended duplexes. eIF4A helicase activity is also affected by substitution of 2′-OH (RNA) groups with 2′-H (DNA) or 2′-methoxyethyl groups. These observations, taken together with results from competitive inhibition experiments, suggest that eIF4A may interact directly with double-stranded RNA, and recognition of helicase substrates occurs via chemical and/or structural features of the duplex.

The initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic systems is an intricate process involving at least 12 protein factors that work in concert to bring the mRNA, the initiating methionyl-tRNA, and the 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits together to form an 80 S complex capable of peptide chain elongation (see Refs. 1Merrick W.C.

DEAD box (and related DEXH box) proteins contain eight highly conserved amino acid sequence motifs and have been implicated in virtually every cellular process involving RNA unwinding and/or rearrangement. These include transcription, ribosomal biogenesis, pre-mRNA splicing, RNA export, translation, and RNA degradation (6de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Trends Biochem.

In vitro analysis of this family of proteins has demonstrated that all members possess RNA-dependent ATPase activity, and many are capable of melting short RNA duplex structures in an ATP-dependent manner (8Rogers Jr., G.W.

Two groups have presented partial crystal structures of yeast eIF4A (31Benz J. Trachsel H. Baumann U. Struct. Fold.

Both show that the three-dimensional fold, strand topology, and the orientation of conserved motifs in the N-terminal portion of eIF4A are strikingly similar to domain I of the HCV NS3, PcrA, and Rep helicases (31Benz J. Trachsel H. Baumann U. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 15: 671-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32Johnson E.R. McKay D.B. RNA. 1999; 5: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of the C-terminal portion eIF4A has been solved and again shows that tertiary structure and positions of the conserved motifs in eIF4A have the same topology as the equivalent domains of the Rep, PcrA, and HCV NS3 helicases (33Caruthers J.M. Johnson E.R. McKay D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13080-13085Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Such similarities strongly suggest a common structural and mechanistic theme among these helicases (34Bird L.E. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).eIF4A has been the subject of intense biochemical study. A detailed kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of the RNA-activated ATPase activity of eIF4A has been performed, which showed that the binding of RNA and ATP to eIF4A is coupled (35Lorsch J.R. Herschlag D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2180-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These data, along with limited proteolysis experiments, suggest that eIF4A undergoes a series of ligand-dependent conformational changes as it binds its substrates (RNA and ATP), hydrolyzes ATP, and releases products (36Lorsch J.R. Herschlag D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2194-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The effect of changing oligonucleotide length, backbone composition, and identity of the 2′-substituent of the ribose moiety has been investigated and shown to alter the nucleic acid binding and ATPase activities of eIF4A (37Peck M.L. Herschlag D. RNA. 1999; 5: 1210-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Previously, we have demonstrated that eIF4A functions alone as an ATP-dependent RNA helicase (8Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Results indicated that the initial rate of eIF4A-dependent unwinding decreased as the stability of the duplex is increased and that eIF4A helicase activity is nonprocessive (8Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). A simple model of unwinding was proposed suggesting that eIF4A affects strand separation by unwinding a small number of base pairs, consequently making the duplex behave as a shorter, less stable duplex in a thermodynamic sense. If there is sufficient destabilization of the duplex by eIF4A, complete stand separation occurs (less stable duplex substrates). Conversely, if the duplex is not sufficiently destabilized by eIF4A, the partially unwound strands reanneal (i.e. snap back), and complete strand separation does not occur (more stable duplex substrates) (8Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In addition, the helicase activity of eIF4A may be stimulated by either eIF4B or eIF4H or if eIF4A exists as part of the eIF4F complex (4Richter N.J. Rogers Jr., G.W. Hensold J.O. Merrick W.C. J.

Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). However, it has not been determined if there is a minimal size of the single-stranded region adjacent to the duplex region of the substrate needed to promote helicase activity or if eIF4A alone may function bidirectionally. Furthermore, the effect of changing the 2′-substituents of the ribose sugars or the phosphate backbone of the duplex on the helicase activity of eIF4A is unknown. In a continuing effort to understand the mechanism by which eIF4A and other DEAD/DEXH proteins unwind nucleic acid duplexes, an investigation of the helicase activity of eIF4A with respect to duplex substrate specificity was performed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsReagents were purchased from the following suppliers: rabbit reticulocyte lysate from Green Hectares, Oregon, WI; ATP and BSA from Sigma; [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]CTP from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; DNA oligonucleotides PTT-23, PTB-44, and D-14, D-15, D-16, D-17, D-20, and D-20C from the Molecular Biology Core Laboratory, Case Western Reserve University; DNA oligonucleotides PTB-41SD, PTB-41S-, PTB-41S+, PTB-44L+, and d-44 from IDT, Inc., Coralville, IA; RNA oligonucleotides R-10, R-11, R-12, R-13, R-14, and R-15 from Cybersyn, Lenni, PA; RNA oligonucleotides R-17–5′, R-19–5′, R-21–5′, R-23–5′, R-28–5′, R-38–5′, R-17–3′, R-19–3′, R-21–3′, R-23–3′, R-28–3′, R-38–3′ R-17C, R-13C, R-13SD, R-13S-, R-13S+, and R-16L+ from Dharmacon, Inc, Boulder, CO; MegashortscriptTM In Vitro transcription kit from Ambion; and T4 polynucleotide kinase from New England Biolabs.

DNA oligonucleotides synthesized by IDT, Inc., were polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-purified, lyophilized, and resuspended in distilled H2O. RNA oligonucleotides synthesized by Cybersyn were polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-purified, lyophilized, and resuspended in distilled H2O. RNA oligonucleotides synthesized by Dharmacon were deprotected per the manufacturer's instructions, lyophilized, and resuspended in distilled H2O. Quantitation of each oligonucleotide was performed by UV spectroscopy, and a value of 33 μg per 1A260 was used in determining concentration. Integrity and proper size of each oligonucleotide was assessed by32P-end-labeling each oligonucleotide (described below) and analysis on a denaturing (7 m urea) 20% polyacrylamide gel with known size standards.Transcription of RNAR-44, -41SD, -41S-, -41S+, and -44L+ (see Table I) were synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase. The templates for transcription were composed of PTT-23 annealed to PTB-44, -41SD, -41S-, -41S+, or -44L+ (see TableI). Transcription reactions were performed using Ambion's MegashortscriptTM transcription kit per the manufacturer's instructions and included 1 μl of [α-32P]CTP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) as a tracer label. Products of the reactions were purified on a denaturing (7 m urea) 14% polyacrylamide (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) gel. The proper bands were located by autoradiography, excised from the gel, and the RNA eluted from the gel slices in 400 μl of 0.5 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 3% phenol:chloroform (v/v) for 3–4 h at 4 °C. The gel slices were removed from the solution by centrifugation through quick-sep columns, and the recovered RNAs were phenol:chloroform-extracted once and ether-extracted twice, followed by ethanol (1 ml) precipitation for 12–24 h at −20 °C. The precipitated RNAs were recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 60 min. The supernatant was removed, and the RNA pellets washed in ice-cold 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in distilled H2O. Quantitation of each purified transcript was performed by UV spectroscopy as described above.Table ICharacteristics of DNA and RNA oligonucleotidesOligonucleotideLengthSequence 5′ → 3′DNA templates for transcriptionPTT-2323gaatttaatacgactcactatagPTB-4466gcgtgctttacggtgctagttttgttttgttttgtttttctccctatagtgagtcgtattaaattcPTB-41SD63ccgttgaagcatcgttgttttgttttgttttgttttctccctatagtgagtcgtattaaattcPTB-41S−63ccgattacgatacgttgttttgttttgttttgttttctccctatagtgagtcgtattaaattcPTB-41S+63cctgttgccatgcgttgttttgttttgttttgttttctccctatagtgagtcgtattaaattcPTB-44L+66ccgaattatacgttacgttgttttgttttgttttgttttctccctatagtgagtcgtattaaattcLong strands of duplex substrates1-aR designates RNA, D designates DNA, PS designates a phosphorothiate backbone, 2′-MOE indicates the substitution of 2′-MOE for 2′-OH.R-4444gggagaaaaacaaaacaaaacaaaacuagcaccguaaagcacgcR-38–5′38aaaacaaaacaaaacaaaacaaaauagcaccguaaagcR-28–5′28aaaacaaaacaaaauagcaccguaaagcR-23–5′23aaaacaaaauagcaccguaaagcR-21–5′21aacaaaauagcaccguaaagcR-19–5′19caaaauagcaccguaaagcR-17–5′17aaauagcaccguaaagcR-38–3′38gcuuuacggugcuuaaaacaaaacaaaacaaaacaaaaR-28–3′28gcuuuacggugcuuaaaacaaaacaaaaR-23–3′23gcuuuacggugcuuaaaacaaaaR-21–3′21gcuuuacggugcuuaaaacaaR-19–3′19gcuuuacggugcuuaaaacR-17–3′17gcuuuacggugcuuaaaR-13C13agcaccguaaagcR-41SD41gggagaaaacaaaacaaaacaaaacaacgaugcuucaacggR-41RE41ggcaacuucguagcaacaaaacaaaacaaaacaaaagagggR-41S−41gggagaaaacaaaacaaaacaaaacaacguaucguaaucggR-41S+41gggagaaaacaaaacaaaacaaaacaacgcauggcaacaggR-44L+44gggagaaaacaaaacaaaacaaaacaacguaacguauaauucggD-4444gggagaaaaacaaaacaaaacaaaactagcaccgtaaagcacgcD-2020gtgcgtgctttacggtgctaShort strands of duplex substrates1-aR designates RNA, D designates DNA, PS designates a phosphorothiate backbone, 2′-MOE indicates the substitution of 2′-MOE for 2′-OH.R-1010gcuuuacgguR-1111gcuuuacggugR-1212gcuuuacggugcR-1313gcuuuacggugcuR-1414gcuuuacggugcuaR-13SD13ccguugaagcaucR-13S−13ccgauuacgauacR-13S+13ccuguugccaugcR-16L+16ccgaauuauacguuacR-17C17uuuaagcaccguaaagcD-1414gctttacggtgctaD-1515tgctttacggtgctaD-1616gtgctttacggtgctaD-1717cgtgctttacggtgctaD-20C20tagcaccgtaaagcacgcacD-PS-161-bIndicates that all of the nucleotides in the oligonucleotide contain the indicated modification.16gtgctttacggtgcta2′-MOE-111-bIndicates that all of the nucleotides in the oligonucleotide contain the indicated modification.11gctttacggtg2′-MOE-131-bIndicates that all of the nucleotides in the oligonucleotide contain the indicated modification.13gctttacggtgct2′-MOE/PS-141-bIndicates that all of the nucleotides in the oligonucleotide contain the indicated modification.14gctttacggtgcta2′-MOE/PS-161-bIndicates that all of the nucleotides in the oligonucleotide contain the indicated modification.16gtgctttacggtgcta1-a R designates RNA, D designates DNA, PS designates a phosphorothiate backbone, 2′-MOE indicates the substitution of 2′-MOE for 2′-OH.1-b Indicates that all of the nucleotides in the oligonucleotide contain the indicated modification. Open table in a new tab 32P-End-labeling of OligonucleotidesForty picomoles of either R-10, -11, -12, -13, -14, -15, -13SD, -13S-, -13S+, -16L+, and -13C or D-14, -15, -16, and -17 oligonucleotides (see TableI) and 10 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) were combined with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (10 μl final volume), and reactions were performed as described (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 11.31-11.32Google Scholar). Percent incorporation of the label into these oligonucleotides is 90–95%, and specific activities of the oligonucleotides are on the order of 1 × 106cpm/pmol. Forty picomoles of DNA-PS, 2′-MOE, or 2′-MOE/PS oligonucleotides (see Table I) and 100 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 6000 Ci/mmol, 150 mCi/ml) were combined with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (10 μl final volume) and reactions were performed as described above. Percent incorporation of the label into these oligonucleotides is 1–5%, and specific activities of the oligonucleotides are on the order of 5×105 cpm/pmol.Helicase SubstratesDuplexes used in the helicase reactions are made by combining long oligonucleotides with appropriate complementary 32P-labeled short oligonucleotides (see TableI for individual oligonucleotide lengths and sequences and figures for duplexes used in specific experiments) in a 1.25:1 ratio, respectively. This excess of long strand is to ensure that essentially all of the labeled short oligonucleotide is in the duplex species. The complementary strands are combined in 1× hybridization buffer (1× Tris-EDTA (TE) plus 100 mm KCl), and the concentration of duplex was 0.5 pmol/μl. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and then slow-cooled to 4 °C over 90 min (0.1 °C/5 s) using a programmable thermocycling instrument. Under these conditions, ∼90–95% of the labeled bottom (short) strand hybridizes to the top (long) strand. The duplex was stored at −20 °C and diluted in 1× hybridization buffer for use in the helicase assay.dsRNA and dsDNA Competitor DuplexesThe R-17-3′/R-17C and D-20/D-20C duplexes used in the competition assay (Fig. 4) were prepared as above except the R-17-3′ and R-17C or d-20 andd-20C oligonucleotides were combined in a 1:1 ratio at a concentration of 105 or 89 pmol/μl, respectively. Control experiments showed that no significant strand separation occurred at the lowest final concentration of duplex used in the competition experiment (10 nm) over the time course of the reaction (data not shown).Helicase AssayThe helicase assay was performed as described in detail previously (8Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Unwinding of duplex substrates was monitored by following displacement of the radiolabeled short strand from the duplex. In general, 20-μl reactions contained 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5 (final pH 7.2), 70 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mmmagnesium acetate (Buffer A). Buffer B′ contained 20 mmMES-KOH, pH 6.0, 15 mm KCl, 15 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mm magnesium acetate. The concentration of ATP was 1 mm; duplex concentration was 1.8–1.9 nm(36–38 fmol), and eIF4A concentration was 0.8 μm (16 pmol), unless stated otherwise. All reactions were mixed in siliconized tubes to minimize material sticking to tube walls and kept on ice throughout the assembly process. Reactions were incubated at 35 °C (unless otherwise stated) for the duration of the time course. In most circumstances, eIF4A was the last component added to the reaction, just before incubation at 35 °C; however, equivalent results were obtained when duplex or competitor was added as the last component. Reactions were terminated by adding 5 μl of a solution containing 50% glycerol, 2% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.05% bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol dyes. The products of unwinding reactions were analyzed by separation of displaced labeled short strand from duplex species by electrophoresis on 15 or 18% native polyacrylamide gels (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) at 4 °C for 2–3 h at 200 V in 1× TBE (TBE, Tris borate/EDTA) buffer. Gels were pre-electrophoresed at 4 °C for 30 min. After electrophoresis, gels were scanned directly using an Ambis radioanalytical scanner. Gels were then exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −80 °C for using intensifying screens.Quantitation of the Helicase AssayQuantitation of the helicase assay was as described previously (8Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In brief, quantitation of counts/min in duplex and displaced/single-stranded RNA bands was performed using the Ambis software. The degree of unwinding for each reaction was determined by measuring the percent of counts/min in duplex and displaced/single-stranded RNA bands using the following formulas: % duplex = cpm duplex/(cpm duplex + cpm displaced strand) and % displaced strand = cpm displaced strand/(cpm duplex + cpm displaced strand). This method of quantitation was used to account for slightly different yields in total counts/min due to variations in pipetting and gel loading steps. The total yield in counts/min among different reactions did not vary by more than ±10% of the average counts/min value of all the reactions in the given experiment. Furthermore, all reagents and protein preparations used in the assay were judged to be free of RNase and phosphatase contamination. A single reaction without (−) eIF4A was incubated at 4 °C during the course of each experiment, and the amount of duplex in this control reaction (typically 36–38 fmol) was normalized to 100%, and the amount of (background) single-stranded RNA (typically 2–4 fmol) was normalized to 0%. All other reactions were scaled to these values. For the competition experiments (Fig. 4), the percentage of inhibition is given by 100 − ((% unwinding of R-41S-/R-13S- in the presence of x μm inhibitor)/(% unwinding of R-41S-/R-13S- in the presence of 0.0 μminhibitor) × 100).Data TreatmentTreatment of data has been described previously (8Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). All data reported are the average of 3–5 separate experiments. Standard errors were less than ±10% in all experiments. Plots and graphs were constructed using Prism software by GraphPad or SlideWrite 4.0. Duplex stability (ΔG) values for RNA/RNA duplex substrates were calculated for 35 °C using the nearest neighbor method of analysis as described by Turner and Sugimoto (42Turner D.H. Sugimoto N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar).

Changing the nonbridging oxygen atom in the oligonucleotide phosphodiester (PO) backbone to sulfur (phosphorothioate (PS) backbone) decreases the stability of the duplex by 0.3 kcal/mol per modification (45Crooke S. Landes R.G. Therapeutic Applications of Oligonucleotides. Austin, TX. 1995; : 53-62Google Scholar). Changing the 2′-group of the ribose sugar to a methoxyethyl (MOE) group increases the stability of the duplex by 0.2 kcal/mol per modification (46Altmann K.H. Fabbro D. Dean N.M. Geiger T. Monia B.P.

https://openalex.org/W2069417551,"We have demonstrated previously that catabolism of a coagulation factor VIII (fVIII) from its complex with von Willebrand factor (vWf) is mediated by low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (Saenko, E. L., Yakhyaev, A. V., Mikhailenko, I., Strickland, D. K., and Sarafanov, A. G. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 37685–37692). In the present study, we found that this process is facilitated by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). This was demonstrated by simultaneous blocking of LRP and HSPGs in model cells, which completely prevented fVIII internalization and degradation from its complex with vWf. In contrast, the selective blocking of either receptor had a lesser effect. In vivo studies of clearance of125I-fVIII-vWf complex in mice also demonstrated that the simultaneous blocking of HSPGs and LRP led to a more significant prolongation of fVIII half-life (5.5-fold) than blocking of LRP alone (3.5-fold). The cell culture and in vivo experiments revealed that HSPGs are also involved in another, LRP-independent pathway of fVIII catabolism. In both pathways, HSPGs act as receptors providing the initial binding of fVIII-vWf complex to cells. We demonstrated that this binding occurs via the A2 domain of fVIII, since A2, but not other portions of fVIII or isolated vWf, strongly inhibited cell surface binding of fVIII-vWf complex, and the affinities of A2 and fVIII-vWf complex for the cells were similar. The A2 site involved in binding to heparin was localized to the region 558–565, based on the ability of the corresponding synthetic peptide to inhibit A2 binding to heparin, used as a model for HSPGs.

Prior to its secretion to plasma, fVIII is processed intracellularly to a series of Me2+-linked heterodimers produced by cleavage at the B-A3 junction (3Fay P.J. Anderson M.T. Chavin S.I. Marder V.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and by a number of additional cleavages within the B domain (2Vehar G.A. Keyt B. Eaton D. Rodrigues H.

These cleavages generate a heavy chain (HCh) consisting of the A1 (residues 1–336), A2 (residues 373–740), and B domains (residues 741–1648), and a light chain (LCh) composed of the domains A3 (residues 1690–2019), C1 (residues 2020–2172), and C2 (residues 2173–2332).

Zonneveld A.-J. Lenting P. Blood. 2000; 96: 3459-3465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Xa (17Narita M. Rudolph A.E. Miletich J.P. Schwartz A.L.

A unique place among LRP ligands belongs to 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP), which binds to LRP with a high affinity (Kd = 4 nm) and efficiently inhibits binding and endocytosis of all known LRP ligands (22Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sites of fVIII involved in interaction with LRP were localized within the A2 domain residues 484–509 (12Saenko E.L. Yakhyaev A.V. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Sarafanov A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37685-37692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and within the C-terminal portion of the C2 domain (23Lenting P. Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M.

Since the latter region of fVIII is likely to be blocked by vWf (23Lenting P. Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M. Clijsters P.F.M. Meijerman D.W.E. Pannekoek H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. Zonneveld A.-J. J.

This is consistent with the reported faster clearance of fVIII in vWf-deficient patients and animals (8Lethagen S. Berntorp E. Nilsson I.M. Ann.

Blood. 2000; 95: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LRP-mediated endocytosis of many ligands is facilitated by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), one of the components constituting extracellular matrix. Among the LRP ligands, lipoprotein lipase (27Chappell D.A. Fry G.L. Waknitz M.A. Muhonen L.E. Pladet M.W. Iverius P.H. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

HSPGs serve either as coreceptors of LRP providing the initial binding of the ligands to the cell surface and their subsequent presentation to LRP (14Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 29Mahley R.W. Ji Z.S. J.

J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1164-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). All LRP ligands interacting with HSPGs are also able to bind to heparin (34Crisp R.J. Knauer D.J. Knauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19628-19637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which is structurally similar to carbohydrate portions of HSPG molecules, and represent a useful model for studying these interactions in a purified system. Noteworthy, the recently reported Kd of 116 nm for fVIII interaction with LRP (12Saenko E.L. Yakhyaev A.V. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Sarafanov A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37685-37692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) is much higher than the normal (∼1 nm) concentration of fVIII in plasma (4Wion K. Kelly D. Summerfield J.A. Tuddenham E.G.D. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1985; 317: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This implies that the direct binding of plasma fVIII-vWf complex to LRP is negligible and suggests possible involvement of other receptor(s) in this process. In the present study, we examined participation of cell surface HSPGs in the binding and catabolism of fVIII-vWf complex, based on the ability of fVIII to interact with heparin (35Barrow R.T. Healey J.F. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 593-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that HSPGs are indeed responsible for the initial binding of fVIII-vWf complex to the surface of various LRP-expressing cells and subsequent facilitation of fVIII catabolism both in cell culture and in vivo. We found that the binding occurs via the fVIII moiety of fVIII-vWf complex and localized the major heparin-binding site of fVIII within its A2 domain. Chondroitin sulfate A, heparin (average molecular weight 17–19 kDa), and biotinylated heparin were purchased from Sigma and Celsus Laboratories Inc., respectively. Chondroitin sulfate A was biotinylated using EZ-Link Biotin-LC-Hydrazide (Pierce) as described (36Bayer E.A. Ben-Hur H. Wilchek M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Human coagulation factors IXa, X, and Xa were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, and heparinase I was purchased from Sigma. Active site fluorescently labeled factor IXa (Fl-FFR-fIXa) was a generous gift of Dr. Philip Fay. Monoclonal antibody 8860 recognizing the A2 domain of fVIII was kindly provided by Baxter/Hyland Healthcare Inc. The rabbit polyclonal anti-LRP antibody Rab 2629, RAP, and125I-labeled activated α2-macroglobulin were kindly provided by Dr. Dudley Strickland. Phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were purchased from Sigma. Phospholipid vesicles containing 25% PS and 75% PC were prepared as described previously (37Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson F.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). The fVIII peptides 432–456, 484–509, and 558–565 were synthesized using a 9050 Milligen synthesizer (Millipore) by the Fmoc ((9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) method and pentafluoro-ester activation chemistry and were purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a C18 column (Waters) in a gradient of 0–70% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The 2.2–3.5 mm solutions of peptides were dialyzedversus 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 mNaCl (HBS) using membrane with 1-kDa cut-off (Pierce). FVIII was purified from therapeutic concentrates prepared by Method M, American Red Cross (38Saenko E.L. Shima M. Gilbert G.E. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27424-27431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). HCh and LCh of fVIII were prepared as described previously (6Saenko E.L. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18007-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The A1 and A2 subunits were obtained from thrombin-activated fVIII using ion exchange chromatography on a Mono S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (12Saenko E.L. Yakhyaev A.V. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Sarafanov A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37685-37692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Prior to labeling, fVIII and A2 were dialyzed into 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 6.8, containing 5 mm calcium nitrate. Five μg of fVIII or A2 in 30 μl of the above buffer were added to lactoperoxidase beads (Worthington) containing 5 μl of Na125I (100 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 5 μl of 0.03% H2O2 (Mallinckrodt) and incubated for 4 min at room temperature. Unreacted Na125I was removed by chromatography on a PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specific radioactivities of 125I-labeled fVIII and A2 were 3–6 μCi/μg of protein. The activity of 125I-fVIII (3650 units/mg) determined in the one-stage clotting assay (39Lollar P. Fay P.J. Fass D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was similar to that of unlabeled fVIII (3840 units/mg). LRP-expressing mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEF) and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells genetically deficient in LRP biosynthesis (PEA 13) were obtained from Dr. Joachim Herz (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) and maintained as described (40Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown to a density of 2 × 105 cells/well as we described previously (12Saenko E.L. Yakhyaev A.V. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Sarafanov A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37685-37692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Human smooth muscle cells (SMC) and human alveolar epithelial cells (T2) were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection. SMC and T2 cells were grown to a density of 105 cells/well in DMEM and Leibovitz's L-15 medium, respectively, containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The complex of 125I-fVIII or unlabeled fVIII with vWf was prepared by incubating the proteins at a 1:50 molar ratio in HBS, 5 mm CaCl2 for 30 min at 25 °C. The complex formation was verified by gel filtration as described previously (12Saenko E.L. Yakhyaev A.V. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Sarafanov A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37685-37692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To assess the contribution of HSPGs in fVIII uptake, the cells were preincubated in the medium containing heparinase-I (Sigma) at a concentration of 0.005 IU/ml for 30 min at 37 °C followed by three washes with HBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Surface binding, internalization, and degradation assays were conducted as described previously (41Kounnas M.Z. Chappell D.A. Wong H. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9307-9312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In some experiments, surface binding was determined after incubation at 4 °C to prevent endocytosis (42Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29039-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Surface binding of radiolabeled ligands was defined as the amount of radioactivity released by treatment with mixture of trypsin (50 μg/ml) and proteinase K (50 μg/ml) (Sigma) as described (43Chappell D.A. Fry G.L. Waknitz M.A. Iverius P.H. Williams S.E. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25764-25767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactivity, which remained associated with the cells, was considered as internalized (41Kounnas M.Z. Chappell D.A. Wong H. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9307-9312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Degradation was defined as radioactivity in the medium that was soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid. The value of degradation was corrected for noncellular degradation by subtracting the acid-soluble radioactivity in parallel wells lacking cells. The rate of conversion of factor X to factor Xa was measured in a purified system (39Lollar P. Fay P.J. Fass D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), in which fVIIIa was substituted by its A2 subunit as described (44Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 45Fay P.J. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29826-29830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The A2 subunit (200 nm) was preincubated with varying concentrations of heparin (0–100 μg/ml) in HBS, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. This was followed by the addition of factor IXa (5 nm) and PSPC vesicles (10 μm) and incubation for 10 min, prior to addition of factor X (300 nm). To determine the initial rates of factor Xa generation, the aliquots were taken at 10, 20, 30, and 45 min, and the reaction was stopped with 0.05m EDTA. Factor Xa generation was determined from conversion of synthetic chromogenic substrate S-2765 (Chromogenix, Sweden) as described (45Fay P.J. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29826-29830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The measurements of interaction of the A2 subunit with Fl-FFR-fIXa were performed as described (45Fay P.J. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29826-29830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A2 was preincubated with varying concentrations of heparin for 15 min at 25 °C in HBS, 5 mmCaCl2. The anisotropy was measured in a 0.2-ml cell upon addition of PSPC vesicles (50 μm) and Fl-FFR-fIXa (30 nm) in the presence or absence of factor X (400 nm). The measurements were carried out using SLM 8000C spectrofluorometer (SLM Instrument Inc.) at the excitation wavelength of 495 nm and emission wavelength of 524 nm. The data were recorded 5 times for each reaction and averaged. The kinetics of interaction of fVIII-vWf complex, fVIII, its fragments, and vWf with heparin or chondroitin sulfate was measured by SPR technique using Biacore 3000 (Biacore, Sweden). Biotinylated heparin (100 μg/ml) or chondroitin sulfate (100 μg/ml) was immobilized at the level of 300 resonance units on the surface of a biosensor SA chip in HBS, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20. The binding of the above ligands was measured in the same buffer at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Dissociation was measured upon replacement of the ligand solution for the buffer without ligand. The chip surface was regenerated by washing with 1 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20. The kinetic parameters were derived from the kinetic curves using Biacore BIA evaluation 3.1 software. Human hepatocellular carcinoma cells HEP G2 (American Tissue Culture Collection) were grown on coverslips to 80% confluence in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, 6% CO2. Intact cells or cells treated with heparinase as above were incubated with 10 nm of fVIII-vWf complex in 0.5 ml of DMEM, 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 4 °C in the absence or presence of RAP (1 μm). The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained for fVIII, LRP, and HSPGs by triple label immunofluorescence staining. Staining for fVIII was performed by subsequent incubation of cells with mouse anti-fVIII monoclonal antibody 8860, biotinylated anti-mouse antibody, and Texas Red-conjugated Avidin D (2.5 μg/ml). Staining for LRP was performed by subsequent incubation with rabbit polyclonal anti-LRP antibody Rab 2629, biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG, and fluorescein Avidin DCS (2.5 μg/ml). Staining for HSPGs was performed by subsequent incubation with mouse monoclonal anti-heparan sulfate antibody 10E4 (Seikagaku Corp.), biotinylated anti-mouse IgG, and 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid Avidin D (5 μg/ml). The primary antibodies were added at 5 μg/ml and incubated with the cells for 1 h at 25 °C. The secondary biotinylated antibodies and fluorescent reagents were purchased from Vector Laboratories and used according to the supplied protocols. Avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories) was applied after staining with each fluorescent probe. The specificity of the staining was controlled using normal mouse or rabbit immunoglobulins instead of the primary antibodies. For microscopy, the coverslips with triple-stained cells were mounted on slides with ProLong Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Inc.). The images were obtained using an Eclipse E800 microscope (Nikon) equipped with a set of selective fluorescent filter blocks and digital SPOT RT camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). Simultaneous visualization of fVIII, LRP, and HSPGs was performed by merging the single-dye images using the SPOT Advanced Program Mode. Prior to the experiment, 125I-fVIII, vWf, and RAP were dialyzed into HBS, 5 mm CaCl2 buffer. BALB/c mice (12–14 weeks old, weight 20–24 g) were injected in the tail vein with 100-μl solutions of either 200 μmprotamine or 150 μm RAP alone or with 100 μl of 200 μm protamine and 150 μm RAP together in the above buffer. After a 2-min interval, 100-μl samples of125I-fVIII-vWf complex formed from 125I-fVIII (15 nm) and vWf (750 nm) were injected into mice either in the absence or in the presence of 100 units (1 mg) of heparin. In the control experiment, 125I-fVIII-vWf complex was injected in the absence of protamine and RAP. Blood samples of 30–40 μl were withdrawn from each mouse via retroorbital puncture into 15 μl of 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.4, at selected time intervals (1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360, and 480 min). The radioactivity per ml of blood at each time point was calculated from radioactivities of the samples and their volumes. The percentage of 125I-fVIII remaining in circulation was calculated assuming the radioactivity of aliquots taken 1 min after injection of 125I-fVIII-vWf complex as 100% (46Connelly S. Gardner J.M. Lyons R.M. McClelland A. Kaleko M. Blood. 1996; 87: 4671-4677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Wells M.J. Blajchman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To verify that no significant fVIII clearance occurred during the 1st min, we compared the radioactivities of 1-min aliquots (n = 20) with the corresponding initial (0 min) radioactivity values. The 0-min values were calculated from the total amount of injected radioactivity and the blood volume of each mouse determined using the formula V = 0.09 × W0.88(48Oakley C.L. Warrack G.H. J. Pathol. Bacteriol. 1940; 50: 372-377Crossref Google Scholar), where W is the animal weight in grams and Vis the total blood volume in milliliters. Lack of statistically significant differences (p = 0.34 according to Student's t test) between these two groups of values justified our assumption that the radioactivity in blood at 1 min after injection of 125I-fVIII-vWf complex can be considered as 100%. The time course of each of the above conditions was examined in four mice and averaged. The kinetics of 125I-fVIII clearance from circulation was fitted to the previously used double-exponential model (12Saenko E.L. Yakhyaev A.V. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Sarafanov A.G. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2006354480,"We investigated the molecular mechanism of the synergism between interferon γ (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) documented in a variety of biological occasions such as tumor cell death and inflammatory responses. IFNγ/TNFα synergistically induced apoptosis of ME-180 cervical cancer cells. IFNγ induced STAT1 phosphorylation and interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) expression. Transfection of phosphorylation-defective STAT1 inhibited IFNγ/TNFα-induced apoptosis, whereas IRF-1 transfection induced susceptibility to TNFα. Dominant-negative IκBα transfection sensitized ME-180 cells to TNFα. IFNγ pretreatment attenuated TNFα- or p65-induced NF-κB reporter activity, whereas it did not inhibit p65 translocation or DNA binding of NF-κB. IRF-1 transfection alone inhibited TNFα-induced NF-κB activity, which was reversed by coactivator p300 overexpression. Caspases were activated by IFNγ/TNFα combination; however, caspase inhibition did not abrogate IFNγ/TNFα-induced cell death. Instead, caspase inhibitors directed IFNγ/TNFα-treated ME-180 cells to undergo necrosis, as demonstrated by Hoechst 33258/propidium iodide staining and electron microscopy. Taken together, our results indicate that IFNγ and TNFα synergistically act to destroy ME-180 tumor cells by either apoptosis or necrosis, depending on caspase activation, and STAT1/IRF-1 pathways initiated by IFNγ play a critical role in IFNγ/TNFα synergism by inhibiting cytoprotective NF-κB. IFNγ/TNFα synergism appears to activate cell death machinery independently of caspase activation, and caspase activation seems to merely determine the mode of cell death.

IFNγ/TNFα synergism appears to activate cell death machinery independently of caspase activation, and caspase activation seems to merely determine the mode of cell death. The pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine TNFα1 exerts a wide variety of biological activities such as induction of septic shock, activation of local inflammatory responses, and fever generation as an endogenous pyrogen (1Fiers W. FEBS Lett... 1991; 285: 199-212Google Scholar). TNFα also kills various tumor cell lines in vitro and mediates anti-tumor effect in vivo (2Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett... 1994; 340: 9-16Google Scholar). TNFα exerts its biological effects by binding to two types of cell surface receptors with molecular masses of 55 kDa (p55) and 75 kDa (p75). TNFα cytotoxicity is mostly mediated by p55 receptors (3Schulze-Osthoff K. Ferrari D. Los M. Wesselborg S. Peter M.E. Eur. J. Biochem... 1998; 254: 439-459Google Scholar). After the ligation of p55 receptors, a canonical apoptotic signal transduction pathway is initiated. The cytoplasmic death domain of p55 receptor interacts with the death domain of intracellular adapter molecules such as TRADD (TNF receptor-associated death domain protein) and FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein), which leads to the activation of initiator caspases (4Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell.. 1996; 84: 299-308Google Scholar). This, in turn, triggers the caspase cascade and ultimately results in apoptotic cell death. In many cases, the anti-tumor effect of TNFα was enhanced by IFNγ (5Sugarman B.J. Aggarwal B.B. Hass P.E. Figari I.S. Palladino Jr., M.A. Shepard H.M. Science.. 1985; 230: 943-945Google Scholar) or metabolic inhibitors such as cycloheximide and actinomycin D (6Kirstein M. Fiers W. Baglioni C. J. Immunol... 1986; 137: 2277-2280Google Scholar). Although these metabolic inhibitors are believed to block the synthesis of cytoprotective proteins, the effects of IFNγ might be mediated by the induction of new proteins that increase the sensitivity of target cells to TNFα. IFNγ/TNFα synergism also has been reported in biological responses other than tumor cell killing. For instance, the two cytokines synergistically up-regulated the expression of numerous genes, including ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1), IP-10, and major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chain (7Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol... 1995; 154: 5235-5244Google Scholar, 8Johnson D.R. Pober J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1994; 14: 1322-1332Google Scholar, 9Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J... 1995; 9: 899-909Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of the synergism between the two cytokines is not clearly understood. It has been reported that IFNγ increases the expression of TNFα receptors (10Ruggiero V. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Baglioni C. J. Immunol... 1986; 136: 2445-2450Google Scholar). However, because the sensitivity of the cells to TNFα is not simply correlated with the level of TNFα receptor expression (11Tsujimoto M. Feinman R. Vilcek J. J. Immunol... 1986; 137: 2272-2276Google Scholar, 12Aggarwal B.B. Eessalu T.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1987; 262: 10000-10007Google Scholar), up-regulation of TNFα receptor alone does not adequately explain the cytokine synergism in the anti-tumor action. In the current work, we utilized ME-180 human cervical cancer cells to investigate the molecular mechanism of synergistic anti-tumor effects of IFNγ/TNFα. We also studied the role of caspase activation in ME-180 cell death by IFNγ/TNFα synergism. Our results indicate that 1) IRF-1 induction after STAT1 activation by IFNγ plays a central role in synergistic tumor cell death by IFNγ/TNFα, 2) IFNγ-induced IRF-1 inhibits cytoprotective NF-κB transactivation, 3) IFNγ/TNFα induces ME-180 cell death regardless of caspase activation, and caspase activation dictates only the mode of cell death between apoptosis and necrosis. ME-180 cervical cancer cell line was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant human IFNγ was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant human TNFα was generously provided by Dr. T. H. Lee (Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea). Caspase inhibitors (z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OCH3)-CH2-fluoromethyl ketone; BD-fmk,t-butoxycarbonyl-Asp(OCH3)-CH2F; z-DEVD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(OCH3)-Glu(OCH3)-Val-Asp(OCH3)-CH2-fluoromethyl ketone; z-IETD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu(OCH3)-Thr-Asp(OCH3)-CH2-fluoromethyl ketone) were purchased from Enzyme Systems (Livermore CA), and cathepsin B inhibitor FA (benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-CH2-fluoromethyl ketone) and MG-132 (carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal-H, also called Z-LLL) were from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma, unless stated otherwise. Cells (3 × 104/well) were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with various combinations of cytokines for the indicated time periods. The optimal concentrations of the cytokines for the cytotoxic action were 100 units/ml for IFNγ and 10 ng/ml for TNFα. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with caspase inhibitors or MG-132 for 1 h before cytokine treatment. After cytokine treatment, the medium was removed, and MTT (0.5 mg/ml) was added, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h in CO2 incubator. After a brief centrifugation, supernatants were carefully removed, and Me2SO was added. After insoluble crystals were completely dissolved, absorbance at 540 nm was measured using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Results were presented as means ± S.E. (n = 3). Morphological changes in the nuclear chromatin of cells undergoing apoptosis were detected by staining with 2.5 μg/ml bisbenzimide Hoechst 33258 fluorochrome (Calbiochem), followed by examination on a fluorescence microscope. In some experiments, cytokine-treated cells were double-stained with propidium iodide (PI, 2.5 μg/ml) and Hoechst 33258 (2.5 μg/ml) to distinguish apoptotic cells from necrotic cells. Intact blue nuclei, condensed/fragmented blue nuclei, condensed/fragmented pink nuclei, and intact pink nuclei were considered viable, early apoptotic, late apoptotic, and necrotic cells, respectively (13Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Itoh Y. Hasegawa J. Yamabe K. Otsuki Y. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res... 1996; 56: 2161-2166Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy was carried out essentially as previously described (13Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Itoh Y. Hasegawa J. Yamabe K. Otsuki Y. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res... 1996; 56: 2161-2166Google Scholar). In brief, cells were fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde, 1% paraformaldehyde, 0.2 m phosphate, pH 7.2, at 4 °C for 2 h. After two washes in 0.2 mphosphate, the cell pellet was post-fixed with 2% OsO4 in the same buffer for 30 min. The pellet was dehydrated in ethanol and then in 100% propylene oxide, followed by embedding overnight at 37 °C for another 3 days at 60 °C. Ultrafine sections were cut and examined on an electron microscope (Hitachi H7100, 75 kV). Cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm EDTA and fixed by adding 100% ethanol dropwise. RNase A (40 μg/ml) was added to resuspended cells, and the incubation was carried out at room temperature for 30 min. PI (50 μg/ml) was then added for flow cytometric analyses. Caspase-3- or -8-like activity was measured using a caspase assay kit (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) according to the supplier's instruction. In brief, caspase-3 or -8 fluorogenic substrates (Ac-DEVD-AMC or Ac-IETD-AMC) were incubated with cytokine-treated cell lysates for 1 h at 37 °C, then AMC liberated from Ac-DEVD-AMC or Ac-IETD-AMC was measured using a fluorometric plate reader with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 420- 460 nm. Cells were lysed in triple-detergent lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentration in cell lysates was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. An equal amount of protein for each sample was separated by 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and sequentially incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-human IRF-1, Santa Cruz; rabbit anti-human STAT1 and anti-human phospho-STAT1, New England Biolabs) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ME-180 cells in 6-well plates were co-transfected with 1 μg of human STAT1 cDNA, dominant-negative mutant STAT1 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Hirano, Osaka University, Japan), human IRF-1 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Taniguchi, University of Tokyo), or phosphorylation-defective dominant-negative mutant IκBα (14Brockman J.A.

Biol... 1995; 15: 2809-2818Google Scholar) together with 0.2 μg of lacZ gene (pCH110, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 48 h after the transfection, cells were treated with cytokines. After another 48 h, the cells were fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and stained with X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside; 1 mg/ml) in 4 mmpotassium ferricyanide, 4 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mm magnesium chloride at 37 °C for detection of blue cells. At least 200 blue cells were counted for each experiment, and transfection efficiency was 10–35%. Results were presented as means ± S.E. (n = 3). NF-κB reporter activity was measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). In brief, ME-180 cells in 12-well plates were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of NF-κB-responsive reporter gene construct carrying two copies of κB sequences linked to luciferase gene (IgGκ NF-κB-luciferase, generously provided by Dr. G. D. Rosen, Stanford University, Stanford, CA) (15Lee K.-Y. Chang W. Qiu D. Kao P.N. Rosen G.D. J. Biol.

After 5 h, activities of firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase in transfected cells were measured sequentially from a single sample using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Results were presented as firefly luciferase activity normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. In some experiments, cells were co-transfected before cytokine treatment with NF-κB p65 (16Ballard D.W. Dixon E.P. Peffer N.J. Bogerd H. Doerre S. Stein B. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Results were presented as means ± S.E. (n = 3). ME-180 cells seeded onto chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and then in cold methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. Fixed cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate for 3 min at 4 °C and then sequentially incubated with mouse anti-p65 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), biotinylated anti-mouse IgG, and streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate. Stained cells were examined on a fluorescent microscope. Nuclear extracts were prepared from ME-180 cells treated with cytokines as previously described (18Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res... 1989; 17: 6419Google Scholar). Synthetic double-strand oligonucleotides of consensus NF-κB binding sequence, GAT CCC AAC GGC AGG GGA (Promega), were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extract was incubated with the labeled probe in the presence of poly- (dI-dC) in a binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES at room temperature for 30 min. For supershift assays, a total of 0.2 μg of antibodies against p65 or p50 subunit of NF-κB were included in the reaction. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. First we screened several tumor cell lines to assess their sensitivity to IFNγ/TNFα-induced cytotoxicity (data not shown). Cytotoxic synergism between IFNγ and TNFα was most evident in ME-180 cells. Although either cytokine alone exhibited no significant cytotoxicity, the combination of the two cytokines significantly reduced ME-180 cell viability (Fig.1 A). The cytokine cytotoxicity was dependent on the dose of IFNγ used. However, concentration higher than 100 units/ml did not further increase the cytotoxicity (TableI). The reduction of cell viability was due to apoptosis as demonstrated by Hoechst 33258 staining and DNA ploidy analysis. IFNγ/TNFα treatment induced nuclear condensation and fragmentation (Fig. 1 B) and led to the appearance of sub-diploid cells (Fig. 1 C), which are hallmarks of apoptotic cells. DNA ploidy assays also indicated that the effect of IFNγ/TNFα was not due to the growth arrest as was shown by the absence of decrease in the percentage of cells in the S phase.Table IDose response of cytokine cytotoxicityTreatments% Viability1-aME-180 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of IFNγ and TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 48 h, and then cell viability was assessed by MTT assays. Viability of untreated cells was set to 100%. Results are the means ± S.E. (n = 3). IFNγ alone at all concentrations tested did not have a significant cytotoxicity (data not shown).

Viability of untreated cells was set to 100%. Results are the means ± S.E. (n = 3). IFNγ alone at all concentrations tested did not have a significant cytotoxicity (data not shown). One hundred units/ml IFNγ and 10 ng/ml TNFα were the optimal concentrations for cytotoxic assays. Open table in a new tab Based on our results that the combination of IFNγ and TNFα, but not either cytokine alone, induced ME-180 cell death, we explored the possibility that IFNγ sensitizes ME-180 cells to TNFα-mediated cytotoxicity. This was first tested by sequential treatment of ME-180 cells with the two cytokines. After IFNγ treatment, TNFα alone was sufficient to induce a significant cytotoxicity in ME-180 cells (Table II). However, sequential treatment with TNFα and then with IFNγ did not have the same effects, indicating that IFNγ confers susceptibility to TNFα on ME-180 cells through induction or up-regulation of certain genes in ME-180 cells. Because STAT1 and IRF-1 are known to be canonical intracellular signal-transducing molecules in IFNγ signaling, we investigated the involvement of STAT1/IRF-1-signaling pathways in IFNγ/TNFα synergism on ME-180 cell apoptosis. IFNγ, but not TNFα, induced phosphorylation of STAT1 and up-regulated IRF-1 expression in ME-180 cells (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the transfection of phosphorylation-defective dominant-negative mutant of STAT1 significantly inhibited IFNγ/TNFα-induced ME-180 cell death, indicating that IFNγ-induced STAT1 activation is critical for the induction of TNFα susceptibility (Fig. 3 A). We next asked whether IRF-1, a downstream mediator of STAT1, is responsible for the priming effects of IFNγ. Transfection of IRF-1 conferred TNFα susceptibility on ME-180 cells in a dose-dependent manner, indicating a central role for IRF-1 in the sensitization of ME-180 cells to TNFα-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3, B andC).Table IICytotoxic effects of sequential treatment of cytokinesTreatment2-aME-180 cells were treated with cytokines as indicated, either simultaneously or sequentially. Treatment with IFNγ (100 units/ml) for 24 h followed by TNFα (10 ng/ml) treatment for 48 h induced a significant cytotoxicity.

A, transient transfection of phosphorylation-defective STAT1 dominant-negative mutant (DN STAT1) significantly inhibited IFNγ/TNFα cytotoxicity, as demonstrated by counting blue cells co-expressing lacZ at 48 h after cytokine treatment (IFNγ, 100 units/ml; TNFα, 10 ng/ml).B, transfection of IRF-1 cDNA (1 μg) induced susceptibility to TNFα. In contrast to empty vector (pcDNA3) transfectants, treatment of IRF-1 transfectants with TNFα alone for 48 h significantly decreased the number of blue cells.C, the effects of IRF-1 were dependent upon the dose of IRF-1 cDNA (0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 μg) used in the transient transfection. The number of blue cells upon transfection with an empty vector without TNFα treatment was set to 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) TNFα is known to initiate both death and survival signals, and recent studies on TNFα-induced survival signal suggested an important role of NF-κB activation (19Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science.. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Google Scholar, 20Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science.. 1996; 274: 782-784Google Scholar, 21Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W.

Thus, we investigated how IFNγ induces susceptibility to TNFα-induced cytotoxicity by examining the role of NF-κB in ME-180 cell death and its possible regulation by IFNγ. Treatment of ME-180 cells with a proteasome inhibitor (MG-132), which is known to inhibit NF-κB activation (23Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell.. 1994; 78: 773-785Google Scholar), rendered the cells sensitive to TNFα-induced apoptosis (Fig.4 A), suggesting the cytoprotective role of NF-κB. Also, upon the transfection of phosphorylation-defective dominant-negative mutant IκBα, TNFα alone induced a significant cytotoxicity, further supporting the cytoprotective role of NF-κB (Fig. 4 B). NF-κB reporter assays indicated that IFNγ pretreatment attenuated TNFα-induced NF-κB activity, suggesting that IFNγ synergizes with TNFα for ME-180 cell apoptosis by inhibiting TNFα-induced cytoprotective NF-κB activity (Fig. 4 C). IFNγ pretreatment, however, did not inhibit nuclear translocation of p65 (Fig.5) or DNA binding of NF-κB induced by TNFα treatment (Fig. 6). Also, IFNγ did not inhibit TNFα-induced degradation of IκBα (data not shown). However, IFNγ treatment did inhibit the NF-κB reporter activity induced by transfection of p65 subunit of NF-κB (Fig.4 D), indicating that IFNγ directly inhibited NF-κB-mediated transactivation within the nuclei without affecting the nuclear translocation or DNA binding of NF-κB. We next studied if IRF-1 mediates this inhibitory action of IFNγ on NF-κB. Transfection of IRF-1 alone was sufficient to inhibit TNFα-induced NF-κB activity, indicating a central role of IRF-1 in the inhibition of NK-κB transactivation by IFNγ (Fig.7 A). We also investigated the possible mechanism of interference between IRF-1 and NF-κB. Transfection of p300 coactivator abrogated the inhibitory effect of IFNγ treatment (Fig. 7 B) or IRF-1 transfection (Fig.7 C) on TNFα-induced NF-κB activity, suggesting the possibility of coactivator competition between IFNγ-induced IRF-1 and TNFα-induced NF-κB.Figure 5No effects of IFN γ on nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of NF-κB.

A, IFNγ pretreatment (100 units/ml, 24 h) did not significantly affect TNFα-induced κB sequence binding of NF-κB proteins (lanes 4 and 5). The identity of DNA-complexed proteins was confirmed by supershift assays using antibodies (Ab) against p65 (lane 6), p50 (lane 7), or both (lane 8). B, ME-180 cells were similarly treated with increasing doses of IFNγ and TNFα as indicated, and then NF-κB was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. IFNγ at all concentrations tested did not significantly influence TNFα-induced DNA binding of NF-κB, indicating that the inability of IFNγ to inhibit TNFα-induced DNA binding of NF-κB was not due to the low dose of IFNγ used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7IRF-1 mediates NF-κB-inhibiting effects of IFN γ probably through coactivator competition.

Transiently transfected cells were treated with cytokines for an indicated time period before NF-κB reporter assays (IFNγ, 100 units/ml; TNFα, 10 ng/ml). C, ME-180 cells were co-transfected with NF-κB reporter construct and the indicated plasmids, and then the luciferase activity was measured after 24 h. Co-transfection of coactivator p300 also abolished the IRF-1 transfection-mediated inhibition of NF-κB reporter activity. CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next investigated whether the activation of caspases is involved in the IFNγ/TNFα-induced apoptosis of ME-180 cells. Cytokine-induced apoptosis of ME-180 cells was accompanied by the activation of caspase-3-like activity, as demonstrated by the cleavage of Ac-DEVD-AMC in IFNγ/TNFα-treated cells (Fig.8). Cytokine treatment also induced the cleavage of Ac-IETD-AMC, indicating concurrent activation of caspase-8-like activity (data not shown). However, pretreatment with broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors such as z-VAD-fmk or BD-fmk failed to inhibit ME-180 cell death by IFNγ/TNFα synergism despite the activation of multiple caspases (Fig.9 A). Instead, IFNγ/TNFα in the presence of caspase inhibitors unexpectedly induced the necrosis of ME-180 cells, as judged by the swelling of dying cells on a light microscope (data not shown). Hoechst 33258/PI staining and electron microscopy confirmed the necrosis of the cells (Fig. 9, Band C). To study the involvement of individual caspases in the switching process from apoptosis to necrosis, cells were pretreated with inhibitors specific for individual caspases instead of z-VAD-fmk. Because we observed the activation of caspase-3 and -8 in the cytokine-treated ME-180 cells, we tested the effects of z-DEVD-fmk and z-IETD-fmk alone or in combination. The z-DEVD-fmk and z-IETD-fmk acted additively in conversion from apoptosis to necrosis, suggesting the involvement of multiple caspases in determining the mode of ME-180 cell death (Table III).Figure 9Induction of necrotic death by IFN γ/TNFα in the presence of caspase inhibitors. A, pretreatment of ME-180 cells with broad spectrum caspase inhibitors such as z-VAD-fmk or BD-fmk did not block the cytokine-induced cytotoxicity as measured by MTT assays at 48 h after the treatment (IFNγ, 100 units/ml; TNFα, 10 ng/ml). B and C, pretreatment with z-VAD-fmk switched the mode of cell death from apoptosis to necrosis as judged by Hoechst 33258/PI double-staining (B) and electron microscopy (C). In Hoechst 33258/PI double-staining, cells with blue intact nuclei were viable cells, whereas those with blue fragmented nuclei were early apoptotic cells. Cells with pink intact nuclei were necrotic cells, whereas cells with pink fragmented nuclei were late apoptotic cells.

Open table in a new tab Here we present evidence that STAT1/IRF-1 pathways initiated by IFNγ play a central role in IFNγ/TNFα synergism in the induction of ME-180 cell apoptosis. Transfection of dominant-negative STAT1 abolished IFNγ/TNFα synergism, whereas transfection of IRF-1 sensitized ME-180 cells to TNFα-induced apoptosis. Thus, STAT1 activation and IRF-1 induction by IFNγ appear to be important in IFNγ/TNFα synergism in ME-180 cell apoptosis. However, dominant-negative STAT1 did not completely abolish cytotoxicity by IFNγ/TNFα, and IRF-1 transfection could not be completely substituted for IFNγ. IFNγ induces STAT1 as well as IRF-1, and some cellular responses to IFNγ are reported to be mediated by both STAT1 and IRF-1 (24Dong Y. Rohn W.M. Benveniste E.N. J.

Neither STAT1 or IRF-1 alone may not explain all of the priming effect of IFNγ in TNFα-induced death.

Previous work in our laboratory also showed that IRF-1 plays a central role in IFNγ/TNFα-induced apoptosis of pancreatic islet β-cells in autoimmune diabetes. 2K. Suk, I. Chang, Y.-H. Kim, S. Kim, J. Y. Kim, and M.-S. Lee, submitted for publication. Caspase induction has been suggested as a possible downstream event after IRF-1 induction in IFNγ-induced apoptosis (28Kano A. Haruyama T. Akaike T. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1999; 257: 672-677Google Scholar). Although RNase protection assays revealed that the expression of caspase-1 and -4 was up-regulated by IFNγ treatment in ME-180 cells (data not shown), there remains yet to be determined how the increases in the expression of these caspases mediate IRF-1 action. In IFNγ/TNFα-induced death of ME-180 cells, caspases seem to be involved in determining the mode of cell death rather than decision between death and survival (see below). Although further works are necessary to completely delineate the downstream signaling pathways after STAT1/IRF-1 in IFNγ/TNFα cytotoxic synergism, our current work indicates that NF-κB is one of the targets of STAT1/IRF-1 action. We demonstrated that IFNγ attenuated TNFα-induced NF-κB reporter activity in ME-180 cells. Also, the inhibition of NF-κB either by transfection of dominant-negative IκB “super repressor” or by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor (MG-132) rendered ME-180 cells sensitive to TNFα-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that IFNγ sensitizes ME-180 cells to TNFα-induced apoptosis by inhibiting NF-κB-mediated activation of survival signals. Furthermore, this action of IFNγ was mediated by IRF-1. It has been previously reported that IRF-1 and NF-κB interact in vitro as well as in vivo for the cooperative induction of inflammatory genes (29Neish A.S. Read M.A. Thanos D. Pine R. Maniatis T. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1995; 15: 2558-2569Google Scholar, 30Drew P.D. Franzoso G. Becker K.G. Bours V. Carlson L.M. Siebenlist U. Ozato K. J.

In ME-180 cells, however, IRF-1 negatively influenced NF-κB activity. IRF-1 does not seem to directly interact with NF-κB because NF-κB transcriptional activity was assessed using a reporter construct containing a κB element but not an IRF-1 response element. Thus, in ME-180 cells, it is likely that IRF-1 indirectly affects NF-κB transcriptional activity through the regulation of other factors modulating the transcriptional activity. We also demonstrated that IFNγ did not block the TNFα-induced translocation of p65 from cytosol to nucleus or DNA binding of NF-κB but yet inhibited NF-κB reporter activity. These results suggest that IFNγ-induced IRF-1 inhibits the nuclear events of NF-κB transactivation but not cytosolic events. Our work also showed that transfection of transcriptional coactivator p300 abolished the inhibition of NF-κB reporter activity by IFNγ. Transcriptional activation by NF-κB requires multiple coactivators (32Sheppard K.A. Rose D.W. Haque Z.K. Kurokawa R. McInerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1999; 19: 6367-6378Google Scholar). It has been recently reported that the intracellular amount of the coactivator p300 is limited compared with other transcriptional factors and that competition for p300 may regulate transcriptional activity (33Hottiger M.O. Felzien L.K. Nabel G.J. EMBO J... 1998; 17: 3124-3134Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that IFNγ-induced IRF-1 competes with TNFα-induced NF-κB for the common coactivator(s) such as p300, and this competition may be responsible for the inhibition of NF-κB transactivation. Then what are the target genes that are induced by NF-κB and are subject to the inhibitory action of IRF-1? Recently, a role of TNF receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF2), TRAF2, c-IAP1 (inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP)) and cIAP2 was reported in anti-apoptosis mediated by NF-κB (19Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science.. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Google Scholar). These are possible candidates for such target genes. Another puzzling point is what determines how IFNγ acts on NF-κB. Previously, IFNγ has been shown to increase TNFα-induced NF-κB activation in enhancing the expression of multiple genes involved in the inflammatory responses (34Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1997; 17: 6746-6754Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, however, our work disclosed that IFNγ inhibited TNFα-induced NF-κB in ME-180 cells. This novel signaling pathway of synergism between IFNγ/TNFα involving competition between IRF-1 and NF-κB for p300 coactivator may not be generalized to other cell types, considering previous reports showing different signaling patterns in response to IFNγ/TNFα (34Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1997; 17: 6746-6754Google Scholar). The same stimulus seems to activate distinct signaling pathways depending on the cell types. Because of this discrepancy in signal transduction pathways, the final outcome would be different among different cell types. Some cells would undergo death by IFNγ/TNFα, whereas other cells may be activated by IFNγ/TNFα to participate in inflammatory responses. Because IFNα is also known to activate the STAT1-signaling pathway, we investigated whether IFNα also synergizes with TNFα to destroy ME-180 cells. Our results indicated that IFNα and TNFα synergistically induced ME-180 cell death, and this was accompanied by the activation of STAT1 and inhibition of NF-κB reporter activity by IFNα in a manner similar to IFNγ. 3K. Suk, I. Chang, Y.-H. Kim, J. Y. Kim, and M.-S. Lee, unpublished data. Thus, the cytotoxic priming role of IFNγ in IFNγ/TNFα synergism presented in the current study does not seem to be restricted to IFNγ. Rather, the STAT1/IRF-1-signaling pathway that can be initiated by either type I or type II interferon appears to be critical for the cytotoxic synergism with TNFα. Our results indicate that IFNγ/TNFα induces death signaling in ME-180 cells regardless of caspase activation and activation of caspases determines the final mode of cell death (apoptosisversus necrosis). These results suggest that IFNγ/TNFα-induced apoptotic and necrotic death signaling pathways have common signaling components, and the mode of cell death depends on distinct signaling events such as caspase activation. A similar dual pathway in cell death has been reported in L929 cells transfected with Fas cDNA (35Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med... 1998; 188: 919-930Google Scholar). Ligation of Fas with anti-Fas antibody induced apoptosis of these cells. However, pretreatment with z-VAD, which inhibits activation of caspases, resulted in necrotic death. Moreover, necrosis of Fas-expressing L929 cells was inhibited by reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI) scavengers such as butylated hydroxyanisol, indicating the involvement of ROI generation in necrotic cell death pathway. Butylated hydroxyanisol, however, did not block IFNγ/TNFα-induced ME-180 cell death in the presence of caspase inhibitors (data not shown), suggesting distinct signal transduction between the two cell types. Nevertheless, dual pathways of death signaling appear to be present in the two cells, and it will be of great interest to see if this type of response could be found in other cell types exposed to similar or different death signals. Whether a cell undergoes apoptosis or necrosis by a given stimulus may be determined by intracellular milieu (36Eguchi Y. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res... 1997; 57: 1835-1840Google Scholar, 37Kane D.J. Sarafian T.A. Anton R. Hahn H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Ord T. Bredesen D.E. Science.. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Google Scholar, 38Cory S. Annu. Rev. Immunol... 1995; 13: 513-543Google Scholar). Intracellular levels of ATP were reported to be a determinant of manifestation of cell death (apoptosis versus necrosis) (36Eguchi Y. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res... 1997; 57: 1835-1840Google Scholar). Also, the fact that Bcl-2 blocks both apoptotic and necrotic cell death supports the presence of common signaling components between the two death-signaling pathways (37Kane D.J. Sarafian T.A. Anton R. Hahn H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Ord T. Bredesen D.E. Science.. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Google Scholar, 38Cory S. Annu. Rev. Immunol... 1995; 13: 513-543Google Scholar). Although our work cannot provide detailed biochemical mechanisms of cell death machinery in ME-180 cells, our studies point out the existence of common components between apoptotic and necrotic death signaling and the role of caspases in determining the type of cell death, which may help understand the general cell death mechanism. In conclusion, we report a novel signal transduction of IFNγ/TNFα synergism in the induction of ME-180 cell apoptosis: IFNγ synergized with TNFα for apoptosis induction by activating STAT1/IRF-1 pathway. We also present evidence that NF-κB activation is a survival signal in TNFα-treated ME-180 cells, and IFNγ inhibits this survival mechanism, resulting in synergistic cytotoxicity with TNFα. Moreover, the mode of ME-180 cell death by IFNγ/TNFα synergism was dictated by caspase activation. The novel mechanism of IFNγ/TNFα synergism presented here may also be applicable to other circumstances, where a similar cytokine synergism could be found such as autoimmune destruction of self tissues by cytokines.

In yeast two ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), UBC6p and UBC7p are implicated in this process. We now report the characterization of murine homologs of these E2s. MmUBC6 is an integral membrane protein that is anchored via its hydrophobic C-terminal tail to the endoplasmic reticulum. MmUBC7, which is not an integral membrane protein, shows significant endoplasmic reticulum colocalization with MmUBC6. Overexpression of catalytically inactive MmUBC7 significantly delayed degradation from the endoplasmic reticulum of two T cell antigen receptor subunits, α and CD3-δ, and suggests a role for the ubiquitin conjugating system at the initiation of retrograde movement from the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings also implicate, for the first time, a specific E2 in degradation from the endoplasmic reticulum in mammalian cells.

Attachment of Ub to proteins involves a process in which one of a number of different Ub-conjugating enzymes (UBCs or E2s) accept Ub from activated E1 enzyme in a transthiolation reaction and subsequently catalyze the formation of an isopeptide bond between Ub and substrate, either with or without the involvement of an Ub-protein ligase (E3) (1Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Proteasomal degradation is not limited to proteins native to the nucleus and cytosol where proteasomes reside. Many transmembrane and lumenal proteins of the secretory pathway are degraded from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by proteasomes. The processes that ultimately result in the proteasomal degradation of these proteins are referred to as ERAD (ER-associated degradation). Steps involved in ERAD can include trimming of N-linked glycans, ubiquitination, retrograde movement through the ER membrane, deglycosylation, and degradation in the cytosol by proteasomes (2Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The temporal and mechanistic relationships between retrograde movement, conjugation with Ub, and possible chaperone-like functions of proteasomes appear to differ based on the nature of the substrate. This might be expected given the varied substrates, which include luminal proteins, proteins having a single membrane-spanning domain, and complex polytopic proteins. Moreover, these substrates may be either mutated misfolded proteins, otherwise normal proteins that have failed to assemble in a complex, or, as is the case with HMGCoA reductase, a normal protein whose activity is regulated by ERAD (3Hampton R.Y. Bhakta H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12944-12948Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Consistent with different requirements for degradation of these varied substrates, a genetic analysis of yeast mutants that are defective in ERAD of HMG-CoA reductase led to the identification of HRD genes (4Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), and a differential dependence among ERAD substrates on yeast HRD genes was recently demonstrated (5Wilhovsky S. Gardner R. Hampton R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In yeast, a number of ERAD substrates are multiubiquitinated, examples include mutant forms of Sec61p (6Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and carboxypeptidase Y (CPY*) (7Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) as well as HMGCoA-reductase (3Hampton R.Y. Bhakta H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12944-12948Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis has implicated two yeast E2s, UBC6p and UBC7p, in ERAD. Deletion of UBC6 and UBC7 stabilizes mutant Sec61p, Sss1p, CPY, Pdr5, and uracil permease (6Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T.

Nature. 1993; 365: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Unlike UBC6p, UBC7p lacks a membrane anchor but associates with an ER-bound protein, Cue1p (11Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Science. 1997; 278: 1806-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells ERAD substrates such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and apoB are ubiquitinated in a cotranslational fashion in vitro (12Sato S. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7189-7192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Zhou M. Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24649-24653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Subunits of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), when not assembled into complexes capable of exiting the ER, are also degraded from the ER. In T lymphocytes multiubiquitinated forms of TCR-α and the TCR CD3-δ subunit are associated with the ER membrane, suggesting that their ubiquitination occurs while still membrane-bound (14Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In initial studies on ERAD of major histocompatability complex class I proteins, evidence for ubiquitination was lacking. However, more recent analyses have provided evidence for ubiquitinated major histocompatability complex class I molecules as degradation intermediates (15Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Collectively, these finding suggest that in mammals, as in yeast, components of the Ub conjugating machinery functionally interact with substrates at the ER membrane. Despite a clear role for ERAD in mammals, no specific E2s have been implicated in this process. We now report characterization of mammalian E2s homologous to yeast UBC6p and UBC7p, establish that these proteins are ER membrane proteins, and provide evidence that a murine UBC7p homolog, MmUBC7, plays a role in the degradation of unassembled TCR subunits from the ER. Cos-7 (number CRL1651; American Tissue Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and HEK-293 (number CRL1573; American Tissue Culture Collection) cells were maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and transfected using the calcium-phosphate method as described (16Pari G.S.

Anti-GRP78 (BiP) antibody was fromStressGen Biotech. (Victoria, Canada). Anti-MDM2 was from Oncogene Science (Cambridge, MA). Lysineless TCR-α (K→RTCR-α/pcDNA3.1) was a gift from Dr. Ron Kopito. Wild type 2B4 TCR-α in pCDM8 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and CD3-δ in pCI (Promega, Madison, WI) were obtained from Dr. Juan Bonifacino. MDM2/pCINeo was a gift from Dr. Shengyun Fang. GenBankTM expressed sequence tag data bases were searched using the amino acid sequences of yeast UBC6p and UBC7p. Murine cDNA clones that were homologous to yeast sequences (referred to as MmUBC6 and MmUBC7) were obtained and sequenced. MmUBC6 was cloned into pCI vector and tagged with HA epitope at the N-terminal by polymerase chain reaction using the primers 5′-ATAGAATTCACCATGGCCTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTCCCGGGCCCGAGATTAGCAATAAC-3′ and 5′-GCCACCTTCATAAGGAGTCATC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with EcoRI and SacI and cloned into pCI digested with the same enzymes. The construct was confirmed by sequencing. To generate MmUBC6 lacking the C-terminal tail, nucleotides encoding the last 52 amino acids were removed by restriction enzyme digestion, and the remainder of the cDNA was subcloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). MmUBC7 was tagged with Myc epitope at the N terminus using primers 5′-ATATGAATTCATGGAGCAGAAGCTGATTTCCGAGGAGGACCTGAACCTCAAATTGGCGGGGACGGCGTTGAAG-3′ and 5′-AACGACGGCCAGTGCCAAGC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with EcoRI and NotI and cloned into pcDNA3. The construct was confirmed by sequencing. Site-directed point mutations were created using QuickChange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. MmUBC6 and MmUBC7 were also cloned into pGEX-KG (20Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) to generate N-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusions. For some experiments, glutathione S-transferase moieties were cleaved by thrombin treatment and residual thrombin was removed by benzamidine-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Coupled in vitro transcription and translation was done in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence or absence of canine pancreas microsomal membranes. Membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min in an air centrifuge. For urea extraction, the membranes were resuspended in 2.5 m urea for 15 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation and separation of supernatant and membrane. The supernatant was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and the pellet resuspended in 0.1 n NaOH. Cos-7 cells were grown on coverslips and transfected using Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's protocol. Cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min then washed twice with PBS. This was followed by incubation with 12CA5 or 9E10 antibody diluted 1:5 in PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min followed by washing with PBS and incubation with secondary antibody coupled to Cy3. For double staining, coverslips were then incubated with second primary antibody conjugated to biotin followed by staining with streptavidin coupled to Alexa 488. Images were obtained on a Leica confocal microscope using 63× and 100× objectives. The 488-nm line of the Argon laser and 568-nm line of the Krypton laser were used to excite Alexa 488 and Cy3, respectively. Emission was collected between 520 and 530 nm for Alexa 488 and between 610 and 700 nm for Cy3. HEK-293 cells were transfected using calcium-phosphate method with 2.5 μg of 2B4 TCR-α/pCDM8 and 5 μg each of either wild type or mutant HA-MmUBC6 or Myc-MmUBC7 or both together. The total amount of plasmid was equalized with pCDNA3. Cells were harvested 36 h post-transfection and incubated for 45 min in methionine-free medium and then labeled for 20 min with 250 μCi of [35S]methionine/ml (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA). Cells were then washed twice at 4 °C with complete medium followed by incubation in complete medium at 37 °C. Cells were harvested at indicated times, and immunoprecipitations were performed as described below followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors as described (14Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were carried out at 4 °C using protein A-Sepharose beads prebound to indicated antibodies. Beads were washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. In some cases 0.05% SDS was included in the wash buffer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western transfer were done according to standard protocols. Blots were developed using either 125I-labeled protein A or chemiluminescence (Pierce). Cells were lysed in triethanolamine buffer and broken as described (14Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was divided in two, and one half was treated with proteinase K as described (14Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed once with triethanolamine buffer and solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% digitonin). To the supernatant, 2× digitonin lysis buffer was added. All samples were centrifuged again at 10,000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with H28 antibody. Treatment with N-glycanase (PNGase F, New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) was carried out as specified by the manufacturer. To identify mammalian orthologs of yeast UBC6p, the GenBankTM expressed sequence tag data base was searched and homologous murine cDNAs obtained and sequenced. One such clone included a putative start codon that was in a good context for translation initiation (21Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar) with a stop codon 5′ to this site in the same reading frame (GenBankTM accession number AF 296656). The open reading frame predicts a protein of 262 amino acids, 12 amino acids more than UBC6p (Fig.1). This putative protein is referred to hereafter as MmUBC6 for the murine homolog of yeast UBC6p based on the convention that E2s are named for the corresponding Saccharomyces cerevisiae member preceded by a two-letter genus/species abbreviation. Homology with UBC6p is most striking in the region surrounding the core E2 domain (amino acids 8–166 of UBC6p), where there is 59% identity and 72% similarity. However, beyond amino acid 166 of the mouse protein there is less than 11% identity. MmUBC6 was determined to be an active E2 by the ability of recombinant MmUBC6 to form thiol ester bonds with Ub in the presence of E1 (data not shown). This activity was abolished by mutation of the predicted active site cysteine (amino acid 94). UBC6p is unique among E2s in that it is a type IV membrane protein, defined as such by its C-terminal membrane anchor that allows for its ER membrane insertion in yeast (10Sommer T. Jentsch S. Nature. 1993; 365: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and when ectopically expressed in mammalian cells (22Yang M. Ellenberg J. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1970-1975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). MmUBC6 similarly has a C-terminal hydrophobic domain, although it is highly divergent from yeast UBC6p. Hydrophilicity analysis using MacVector (Oxford Molecular Group, Oxford, UK) and GCG (Genetics Computer Group Inc., Madison, WI) programs suggests that this domain begins at amino acid 228 and extends at least to amino acid 246 and possibly to amino acid 249. Notably aSchizosaccharomyces pombe E2, SpUBC25K, which exhibits overall homology to UBC6p, also shows very little homology in the C-terminal hydrophobic region. However, a human expressed sequence tag clone homologous to yeast UBC6p was also sequenced and was found to be 94% identical to MmUBC6 with a single amino acid substitution in the C-terminal hydrophobic region (GenBankTM Accession number AF 296658). This clone will be referred to as encoding HsUBC6. It should be noted, however, that HsUBC6 is not a member of the unique mammalian UBCH6 family of E2 enzymes (23Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To determine whether MmUBC6 is a membrane protein, it was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of canine microsomes. This yielded a ∼31-kDa protein (Fig.2), of which substantially more than 50% was consistently found in the membrane fraction (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 1 and 2). Membrane-associated MmUBC6 was resistant to urea extraction (Fig. 2 A,lanes 3 and 4) and released into the soluble fraction upon extraction with Triton X-100 (Fig. 2 A,lanes 5 and 6). A truncation lacking the C-terminal hydrophobic domain (MmUBC6d) partitioned almost entirely into the soluble fraction (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and8). Thus, MmUBC6 is also a C-terminal anchored, integral membrane protein. Other C-terminal anchored membrane proteins have been reported to be inserted in membranes post-translationally. To determine whether this is the case for MmUBC6, it was translated in vitro without microsomes and then assessed for membrane insertion by incubation with canine micosomes followed by separation of membrane and soluble fractions by centrifugation. When membranes were added, ∼40% of MmUBC6 partitioned into the membrane fraction (Fig.2 B, c and d) and was largely resistant to urea extraction (Fig. 2 B, e and f). In contrast MmUBC6d was almost entirely recovered in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2 B). When ectopically expressed in mammalian cells, increasing the C-terminal hydrophobic domain of yeast UBC6p from 17 to 21 amino acids results in a redistribution along the secretory pathway from the ER to the Golgi (22Yang M. Ellenberg J. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1970-1975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The predicted hydrophobic domain of MmUBC6 is longer than its yeast counterpart. However, its subcellular localization by immunofluorescence revealed a lacelike ER pattern (Fig. 3, C andG) and colocalization with UBC6p (Fig. 3, D–F). Thus, MmUBC6 is also an ER membrane protein.Figure 3Confocal immunofluorescence localization of MmUBC6 and ScUBC6p. Cos-7 cells were transfected with HA-MmUBC6 and Myc-ScUBC6p.

Genomics. 1998; 51: 128-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Lin H. Wing S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14685-14691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar); however, no evidence for physical or functional association with the ER has been demostrated. A murine UBC7p homolog was identified in the expressed sequence tag data base that encodes an open reading frame predicting a protein of 168 amino acids that shares 62% identity and 73% similarity with yeast UBC7p, and 96% identity and similarity with its human homolog (GenBankTM accession number AF 296657). We refer to this protein as MmUBC7. In vitro translation results in an 18-kDa protein, consistent with the deduced amino acid sequence. The capacity of this E2 to form thiol ester bonds with Ub was confirmed (data not shown). MmUBC7 lacks a hydrophobic domain and is therefore predicted to be a soluble protein. However, incubation of MmUBC7 with microsomal membranes after in vitro translation resulted in ∼15% of MmUBC7 becoming membrane associated (Fig. 4 A), whereas another core E2, UbcH5B (26Jensen J.P. Bates P.W. Yang M. Vierstra R.D. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30408-30414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) did not bind to membranes (Fig.4 A). Further evaluation of the membrane association of MmUBC7 was undertaken by transient expression of Myc-epitope-tagged MmUBC7. MmUBC7 was found both in the cytosolic and microsomal membrane fractions (Fig. 4 B, upper panel,lanes 1 and 3). In contrast all of the anti-UbcH5B immunoreactivity was in the cytosolic fraction (Fig.4 B, lower panel, lanes 1 and2). When evaluated by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, MmUBC7 appears to be diffusely expressed, but a discrete underlying ER pattern is evident (Fig.5 A). To confirm this ER association, it was coexpressed with MmUBC6. Fig. 5 (B–D) shows confocal images from the same cell expressing both HA-MmUBC6 (5B) and Myc-MmUBC7 (5C). A significant colocalization of Myc-MmUBC7 with HA-MmUBC6 to the ER was observed when (5B) and (5C) were overlaid (Fig.5 D, yellow shows colocalization). Previous studies have established that ERAD of TCR-α, a type I transmembrane protein with a short cytoplasmic tail of 5 amino acids, is dependent on proteasome function. To evaluate whether mammalian homologs of UBC6p and UBC7p are involved in targeting TCR-α for degradation, catalytically inactive forms of these E2s were coexpressed with TCR-α in HEK-293 cells. Levels of TCR-α were evaluated by immunoblotting with anti-TCR-α. Although overexpression of a mutant of MmUBC6 in which the active site Cys was converted to Ser (C94SMmUBC6) did not substantially affect TCR-α levels, the analogous catalytically inactive MmUBC7 (C89SMmUBC7) resulted in marked increase in TCR-α levels (Fig.6, A and B). Coexpression of the two inactive E2s did not result in a further increase (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, overexpression of inactive MmUBC7 did not result in accumulation of Mdm2, which is a non-ER protein that is ubiquitinated and degraded by proteasomes (Fig.6 C). Neither wild type MmUBC6 nor MmUBC7 had any significant or reproducible effect on TCR-α (Fig. 6, A andB). To confirm that the effect observed with overexpression of C89SMmUBC7 was due to inhibition of degradation, TCR-α half-life was directly determined by pulse-chase metabolic labeling. TCR-α consistently exhibited a 45–65% increase in half-life when C89SMmUBC7 was coexpressed (TableI). Concomitant overexpression of inactive MmUBC6 did not further increase TCR-α survival.Table IHalf-life of TCR-α in HEK-293 cells calculated from three independent experimentsExperimentHalf-life of TCR-α−C94SMmUBC6C89SMmUBC7C94SMmUBC6 + C89SMmUBC7h13.53.55.65.823.53.55.25.034.13.66.46.3 Open table in a new tab Previous studies in non-T cells have suggested that when proteasome function is inhibited, a significant amount of the accumulated TCR-α has undergone retrotranslocation from the ER to the cytosol accompanied by deglycosylation (29Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 30Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To determine the location of TCR-α that accumulates with inactive MmUBC7, cells expressing TCR-α were subjected to proteinase K (PnK) digestion followed by separation of cytosolic and membrane fractions (Fig.7). When inactive MmUBC7 was coexpressed, increased amount of TCR-α were seen (compare lanes 1–4,9–12, and 17–21). All of this accumulated TCR-α was found in the membrane fraction and was resistant to PnK digestion and therefore has not undergone retrotranslocation through the ER membrane. When proteasome function was inhibited (lanes 5–8, 13–16, and 21–24) levels of accumulated TCR-α increased, still the large majority of the immunoreactive material was found in the membrane fraction resistant to PnK. However, a small fraction of the accumulated TCR-α was PnK-sensitive and included full-length and more rapidly migrating species (open arrow) that represent deglycosylated forms (see below and Fig. 7 B) in the cytosolic fraction as well as similar rapidly migrating species in the membrane fractions. Although these PnK-sensitive forms were observed in all proteasome-treated samples, when compared with the levels of full-length PnK-resistant TCR-α, retrotranslocated forms were found at a proportionally lower level in cells expressing inactive MmUBC7. The findings that inactive MmUBC7 results in the accumulation of fully protected membrane-associated TCR-α and that there is a proportional decrease in cytoplasmically disposed species when proteasome function is inhibited implicates MmUBC7 in playing a role in ERAD prior to retrograde movement through the ER membrane. As already noted, the faster migrating species observed when proteasome function is inhibited are consistent with previous reports for TCR-α where cleavage of N-linked oligosaccharides is observed concomitant with retrotranslocation to the cytosol. Consistent with this, TCR-α treated with N-glycanase comigrates with the lower molecular weight forms of TCR-α (Fig. 7 B). To determine whether the inhibitory effects on TCR-α degradation observed with C89SMmUBC7 are dependent on ubiquitination of TCR-α on lysine residues, we evaluated a previously reported lysine-less form of TCR-α (27Yu H. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36852-36858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This form of TCR-α is degraded from the ER in a proteasome-dependent manner despite a lack of potential sites for ubiquitination. As is evident, lysine-less TCR-α also accumulated when inactive MmUBC7 is coexpressed (Fig.8 A). Treatment with lactacystin results in accumulation of lysine-less TCR-α, including lower molecular weight forms. As with wild type TCR-α, appearance of these forms is decreased when C89SMmUBC7 is coexpressed (Fig. 8 B), and, as would be predicted, these species were PnK-sensitive (data not shown). The CD3-δ subunit of the TCR is also a substrate for ERAD when it fails to assemble with other TCR components and exit the ER (14Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This protein differs from TCR-α in having a substantial cytoplasmic domain and only a single charge in its transmembrane domain. To assess whether MmUBC7 is also involved in the degradation of this protein, pulse-chase analysis of CD3-δ was carried out. When CD3-δ was expressed alone in HEK-293 cells, it was rapidly degraded (Fig. 9 A). However, as with TCR-α, its loss was significantly inhibited when coexpressed with catalytically inactive MmUBC7. Inactive MmUBC6 did not significantly affect CD3-δ degradation (not shown). To further evaluate CD3-δ a C-terminal HA-tagged form was generated. After determining by pulse-chase metabolic labeling that it was degraded with kinetics indistinguishable from wild type CD3-δ (data not shown), it was used to assess the effects of catalytically inactive MmUBC7 on steady state levels of CD3-δ by Western blotting. As expected, steady state levels of CD3-δ increased either when catalytically inactive MmUBC7 was overexpressed or when proteasome function was inhibited (Fig. 9 B). Unlike TCR-α, for which retrotranslocated forms are detectable when proteasome function is inhibited, our previous studies in T cells had not noted any evidence of retrotranslocation of endogenous CD3-δ (14Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, regardless of whether or not inactive MmUBC7 was coexpressed with CD3-δ, forms that accumulated in the presence of proteasome inhibitor were limited in distribution to the membrane fraction. These results are in accord with the model of coupled membrane extraction and proteasomal activity previously suggested for CD3-δ and suggest that, as with TCR-α, MmUBC7 is acting prior to retrograde movement through the ER membrane (Fig.9 C). This study provides evidence that two mammalian E2s localize to the ER membrane. For MmUBC6 its C-terminal hydrophobic domain provides a basis for its membrane insertion. MmUBC7 lacks a membrane anchor that would allow for direct membrane insertion. In yeast, interaction with a C-terminal anchored protein, Cue1p, provides a molecular explanation for ER localization of UBC7p (11Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Science. 1997; 278: 1806-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Although mammalian Cue1p homologs have not been reported, it seems likely that an analogous protein may play a role in tethering of MmUBC7 to the ER membrane. Previous studies in cells expressing a temperature-sensitive ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1) have shown that a functional Ub pathway is required for degradation of TCR-α from the ER (27Yu H. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36852-36858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Data presented herein provides the first evidence implicating a specific E2, MmUBC7, in degradation from the ER in mammalian cells. Overexpression of catalytically inactive MmUBC7 results in decreased degradation of both the TCR-α and the CD3-δ subunits of the TCR. In contrast there is no evidence of a role for MmUBC6 in degradation of TCR-α. Similarly, no effect of mutant MmUBC6 was observed on degradation of CD3-δ. 2S. Tiwari and A. M. Weissman, unpublished observations. The negative data obtained with inactive MmUBC6 is consistent with deletion analyses in yeast where UBC7p is the predominant E2 in ERAD, whereas UBC6p has partial effect on degradation of certain proteins, including Sec61 (6Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and CPY* (7Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), and no effect on Vph1 (28Hill K. Cooper A.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For proteins such as CD3-δ, which have cytoplasmically disposed lysines, it is easy to envisage models for ERAD that include ubiquitination of cytoplasmic lysines, recognition of ubiquitinated species by proteasomes, and dislocation and destruction from the ER facilitated by chaperone-like functions of proteasome. The lack of discernable retrotranslocation observed for CD3-δ in the presence of lactacystin with or without coexpression of inactive MmUBC7 is consistent with such a model and extends previous observations from our laboratory made on endogenous CD3-δ in T cells. Less obvious is how components of the Ub-conjugating system function in the retrotranslocation of lumenal proteins and of transmembrane proteins lacking cytoplasmic sites for ubiquitination, such as TCR-α. The N terminus of this protein is in the ER lumen, and it has no lysines in its cytoplasmic tail. When evaluated by pulse-chase analyses in T cells, TCR-α undergoes a discrete degree of proteasome-independent retrograde translocation that should allow exposure of potential sites of ubiquitination (14Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, similar evidence for partial retrograde movement is not obvious in our experiments in HEK-293 cells. Studies from other groups carried out in non-T cells have provided evidence that when expressed ectopically some level of complete retrograde translocation and accompanying deglycosylation of TCR-α occurs in the absence of proteasome function (29Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 30Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Our observations corroborate these findings. However, even after 16 h of proteasome inhibition, the amount of cytoplasmically disposed TCR-α represents only a small fraction of the total accumulated material, suggesting a continued requirement for proteasome function for efficient complete retrotranslocation and degradation from the ER, as has been suggested for an engineered model substrate (31Mayer T.U. Braun T. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3251-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and for Pdr5 (8Plemper R.K. Egner R. Kuchler K. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32848-32856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) in yeast. Similarly, a requirement for proteasome function in retrotranslocation has been reported for unassembled soluble Ig subunits (32Chillaron J. Haas I.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and CD4 (33Schubert U. Anton L.C. Bacik I. Cox J.H. Bour S. Bennink J.R. Orlowski M. Strebel K. Yewdell J.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) in mammalian cells. Results with TCR-α demonstrate that the relative amounts of cytoplasmically disposed material is consistently decreased when inactive MmUBC7 is coexpressed, even when proteasome function is inhibited, suggesting that MmUBC7 may play a role in the process leading to retrotranslocation upstream of the involvement of proteasomes. For CD3-δ the absence of detectable cytoplasmic forms under any circumstances precludes statements as to whether MmUBC7 act upstream of the proteasome. But it is evident that, as with TCR-α, this E2 is affecting the fate of CD3-δ prior to its removal from the ER membrane. Results obtained with both of these transmembrane TCR components are consistent with findings in yeast for a nontransmembrane ER protein, CPY*, where deletion of UBC7 resulted in its accumulation in the ER lumen (35Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). An important question is whether it is the ubiquitination of TCR-α itself by mammalian UBC7 homologs that is required for retrograde movement. Although this is the simplest explanation, and TCR-α clearly is a substrate for ubiquitination (14Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the fact that TCR-α does not include cytoplasmic primary amines that could serve as sites of ubiquitination argues against this. Also against such a model is the finding that accumulation of retrotranslocated forms of lysine-less TCR-α in response to lactacystin is also inhibited by catalytically inactive MmUBC7. This therefore leads to the consideration of more complex models in which MmUBC7 enhances TCR-α loss indirectly, perhaps by ubiquitination of another protein that then facilitates translocation of TCR-α out of the ER. Applying such a model to other ERAD substrates would resolve the topological conundrum implicit in postulating ubiquitination of lumenal proteins such as CPY* as a primary event allowing for retrograde movement from the ER (35Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Another issue that arises is the nature of the E3s with which MmUBC7 interacts. In yeast HRD1/DER3 is implicated in epistasis analysis along the same pathway as UBC7 in the degradation of several yeast proteins including CPY* and HMGCoA reductase (5Wilhovsky S. Gardner R. Hampton R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Whether mammalian homologs of HRD1 exist remains to be determined. Another ubiquitin ligase component implicated in degradation from the ER is the F-box protein βTRCP. This protein forms part of an SCF E3 complex and is implicated in the degradation of CD4 from the ER with phosphorylated HIV-1 Vpu functioning as an adaptor (33Schubert U. Anton L.C. Bacik I. Cox J.H. Bour S. Bennink J.R. Orlowski M. Strebel K. Yewdell J.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. Mol Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). At least for nonmembrane proteins, SCF complex components are known to function with the yeast E2 CDC34 and its mammalian homologs. Whether βTRCP-containing SCF takes advantage of ER membrane-bound MmUBC7 or perhaps MmUBC6 when targeting CD4 for degradation from the ER now awaits determination.

The decision between cell survival and cell death depends on the balance of constitutive and extracellular signal-induced pro- and anti-apoptotic factors. Disturbances in the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors can lead to either increased cell death or increased cell survival and are involved the development of diseases such as AIDS and cancer. Programmed cell death can occur by multiple pathways with the apoptotic and the necrotic pathways at the extremes (1Fiers W. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Some cells are competent to follow one cell death pathway but lack required components for another or contain survival factors that block a particular pathway. In addition, different cell death pathways can co-exist within the same cell and be activated by different stimulants. The regulation of cell survival and cell death involves many signaling pathways, and the decision between cell survival and cell death requires cross-talk between these pathways and checkpoints where pro- and anti-apoptotic signals converge (2Wang E. Marcotte R. Petroulakis E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 32/33 (suppl.): 95-102Crossref Google Scholar). p21-activated protein kinases (PAK)1 are a growing family of serine/threonine protein kinases, which are activated by binding of monomeric (p21) G-proteins such as Cdc42 and Rac and subsequent autophosphorylation at a threonine residue in the activation loop (3Knaus U.G.

PAKs have been implicated in a wide range of biological functions such as cell morphology and motility, stress response, programmed cell death, and malignant transformation. At least three isoforms of PAK exist in mammals. α-PAK (PAK1), a 68-kDa protein, is present in brain, muscle, and spleen (9Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L.

PAKs can stimulate JNK and p38 activity in some cell types but the degree of stimulation is modest and may reflect indirect effects (4Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J.

(The reference states that PAK-3 (β-PAK) phosphorylates c-Raf, but it is actually PAK-2 (γ-PAK) (20Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This error in nomenclature is due to temporary mistakes in the GenBankTM annotations for PAK.) Phosphorylation of c-Raf by γ-PAK is required for activation of the ERK pathway in response to growth factors or by oncogenic Ras (19King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). MEK-1, another protein kinase in the ERK pathway, has been shown to be phosphorylated by α-PAK (21Frost J.A.

In addition to a role in mitogenic stimulation PAKs are also involved in cell transformation. Catalytically inactive mutants of PAK inhibit Ras transformation of rat Schwann cells and cooperative transformation of Rat-1 cells by Ras, Rac, and Rho (22Tang Y. Marwaha S. Rutkowski J.L.

Groffen J. Sanders L.C. Knaus U.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Hyperactivity of PAK is required to convey the highly proliferative phenotype. Recently, α-PAK has been shown to mediate signals from Ras through phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Akt to sustain cell transformation (26Tang Y. Zhou H. Chen A. Pittman R.N. Field J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9106-9109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Activated Akt stimulates α-PAK activity through a p21 G-protein-independent mechanism. One of the downstream targets of Akt is the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bad. Bad dimerizes with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL and inhibits their ability to block the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (27Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Bad at Ser-112 and Ser-136 results in dissociation from Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL and association with 14-3-3. α-PAK has been shown to phosphorylate Bad in vitro and in vivo at Ser-112 and Ser-136, and phosphorylation at these residues correlates with stimulation of cell survival (28Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The authors also report that γ-PAK phosphorylates Bad in vitro, but phosphorylation and inhibition of Bad in vivo has not yet been demonstrated for γ-PAK. The mammalian PAK isoforms have a high degree of sequence homology, especially within their catalytic domain (3Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J.

The regulatory domains contain regions of high sequence homology but also nonconserved regions that may reflect important differences in functions. A unique characteristic of the ubiquitous γ-PAK is the existence of a cleavage site for caspase 3 or a caspase 3-like protease within the regulatory domain (29Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 30Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28733-28739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cleavage by caspase 3 removes most of the regulatory domain and results in the irreversibly activated γ-PAKp34 fragment. Caspase cleavage of γ-PAK is correlated with Fas- and ceramide-induced cell death of Jurkat cells, TNF-α-induced cell death of MCF-7 cells, heat shock-induced cell death of BALB3T3 and Hep 3B cells, and UVC light-induced cell death of A431 cells (29Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 31Tang T.K. Chang W.C. Chan W.H. Yang S.D. Ni M.H. Yu J.S. J. Cell.

Ectopic expression of γ-PAKp34 induces morphological changes, which are typical for the initial stages of apoptosis, and is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in CHO, HeLa, and Jurkat cells (33Lee N. MacDonald H. Reinhard C. Halenbeck R. Roulston A. Shi T. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13642-13647Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 34Rudel T. Zenke F.T. Chuang T.H. Bokoch G.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 7-11PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, caspase-activated γ-PAK appears to have a pro-apoptotic role in programmed cell death. Here, we show that the ubiquitous γ-PAK can also act as a survival factor and protect cells from programmed cell death. Ectopic expression of constitutively active full-length γ-PAK stimulates survival of BALB3T3 fibroblasts in response to stress stimulants such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), growth factor withdrawal, and UVC light. Cell survival is stimulated, because constitutively active γ-PAK protects BALB3T3 cells from cell death. Phosphorylation and inhibition of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bad is one mechanism by which γ-PAK mediates stimulation of cell survival. Other potential survival mechanisms mediated by γ-PAK include regulation of ERK, JNK, and p38 activation. The inducible retroviral expression system pRevTet-On was obtained from CLONTECH. The constitutive retroviral expression vector pBMNZ was a gift from Dr. Gary Nolan at Stanford University. Cloned Pfu DNA polymerase was purchased from Stratagene.

[γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. cDNAs encoding the protein coding region of wild-type γ-PAK and the kinase-deficient mutant γ-PAK-K278R were subcloned into pKoz/EGFP to form a fusion with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Site-directed mutagenesis according to the megaprimer PCR method (35Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar, 36Jakobi R. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23894-23902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was performed with Pfu DNA polymerase to obtain the constitutively active mutant γ-PAK-T402E, where Thr-402 was replaced with glutamic acid to mimic a phosphate group incorporated by autophosphorylation. The resulting mutant was subcloned into pKoz/EGFP and sequenced to confirm the T402E mutation and to ensure the absence of accidental mutations due to misincorporation during PCR. EGFP fusion constructs for wild-type γ-PAK, kinase-deficient γ-PAK-K278R, and constitutively active γ-PAK-T402E were subcloned into the inducible retroviral expression vector pRevTRE. Mouse Bad was subcloned by PCR using the pEBG-mBad plasmid from New England BioLabs as a template into the constitutive retroviral expression vector pBMNZ. The ecotropic 293T-cell-derived packaging cell line Phoenix Eco (37Hofmann A. Nolan G.P. Blau H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5185-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the normal mouse fibroblast cell line BALB3T3, and the K-Ras sarcoma virus-transformed K-BALB cell line (38Aaronson S.A. Todaro G.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1968; 72: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 39Aaronson S.A. Weaver C.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1971; 13: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC). Phoenix Eco, BALB3T3, and K-BALB cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For long term storage, cells were frozen overnight at −80 °C and stored in liquid nitrogen. Ecotropic retroviruses for the transduction of murine cells were obtained by transient transfection of the retroviral vectors into the packaging cell line Phoenix Eco. Phoenix Eco cells were grown to ∼50% confluency in 100-mm culture dishes and then transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000. The culture medium was replaced at 24 h after transfection, and retrovirus-containing medium was collected at 48 h after transfection and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. For long term storage the retrovirus-containing medium was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. BALB3T3 fibroblasts were grown to ∼10–20% confluency in 100-mm culture dishes and then transduced by addition of 0.5–2 ml of retrovirus-containing medium from packaging cells in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene. The culture medium was replaced at 24 h after transfection and culture medium containing 750 μg/ml Geneticin or 300 μg/ml hygromycin B was added at 48 h to select stable cell populations for pRevTet-On or pRevTRE, respectively. Cells were treated with TNF-α by changing to growth medium containing 1 or 10 ng/ml TNF-α. Growth factor withdrawal was achieved by changing to growth medium without fetal bovine serum or with 0.1% fetal bovine serum. For UVC light treatment, growth medium was removed, cells were exposed to 50 J/m2 in an UV-cross-linker at 254 nm, and then new growth medium was added. Cell viability in response to stress stimulants was determined with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay. Quadruplicate cell samples were grown in 96-well plates, and cell viability was measured at 24 h after treatment by addition of the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxy-methoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2M) tetrazolium compound. Over a 2 h incubation at 37 °C, MTS was converted to the colored formazan, which was detected at 490 nm with a plate reader. Background absorbance was corrected by subtraction of blanks with an equal volume of growth medium. Background caused by cellular debris was corrected by subtraction of sample absorbance at the reference wavelength of 630 nm. Cell proliferation was measured as the percentage of cells in DNA synthesis by BrdUrd incorporation. Cells treated with stress stimulants or untreated control cells were incubated for 24 h. BrdUrd at 10 μm was then added for the final 30 min. Cells were detached and collected by centrifugation. Collected cells were fixed with 70% ethanol, stained with a monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody and an Alexa-568-conjugated secondary antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions, and analyzed by flow cytometry on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan. Cell death was measured by the uptake of propidium iodine, which indicates loss of membrane integrity. Stress stimulant-treated cells or control cells were detached and collected by centrifugation. Collected cells were stained with 0.2 μg/ml propidium iodine and analyzed by flow cytometry on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan. Cells were lysed in M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 200 μm sodium vanadate. Protein concentrations were determined by a Bradford protein assay using bovine γ-globulin as a standard protein. Recombinant EGFP-tagged γ-PAK was immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal anti-EGFP antibody. Endogenous γ-PAK and α-PAK were immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal agarose-conjugated anti-γ-PAK (N19) and anti-α-PAK (N20) antibodies, respectively. For immunoprecipitations 0.4 μg of antibody was used per 100 μg of cell lysate. Western blots were performed with cell lysates (30 μg) or immunoprecipitates (from 50 to 100 μg of cell lysate) by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, semidry transfers onto polyvinylidene membranes, and detection by ECL using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Recombinant EGFP-tagged γ-PAK was detected with the monoclonal anti-EGFP antibody. Endogenous γ-PAK and α-PAK were detected with the polyclonal anti-γ-PAK (V19) and anti-α-PAK (N20) antibodies, respectively. Phosphorylated forms of Bad, ERK, JNK, and p38 were detected with phospho-specific antibodies. Antibodies that detect both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms were used to determine the protein levels of Bad, ERK, JNK, and p38. Autophosphorylation and activity of immunoprecipitated γ-PAK (from 50 to 100 μg of cell lysate) toward histone 4 (1 μg) was determined in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1000–2000 cpm/pmol) for 30 min at 30 °C in absence and presence of Cdc42(GTPγS) (1 μg). Cdc42 was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and preloaded with GTPγS as described previously (13Jakobi R. Chen C.J. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6206-6211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 32P incorporation into γ-PAK or histone 4 was analyzed by electrophoresis on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography and quantified by scintillation counting of excised protein bands. In-gel assays were performed with 0.2 mg/ml myelin basic protein co-polymerized in the separating gel of 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (40Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared as described above. Cell lysates (30 μg) or immunoprecipitates (from 50 to 100 μg of cell lysate) were separated by electrophoresis in the substrate-containing gels. After electrophoresis, gels were washed twice for 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl pH (8.0), 20% 2-propanol, once for 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl pH (8.0), 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A), and denatured twice for 1 h in buffer A containing 6m guanidine-HCl at room temperature. Renaturation was performed with five changes of buffer A containing 0.04% Tween 40 for 16–24 h at 4 °C. Phosphorylation was carried out in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm EGTA, 30 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (500 cpm/pmol) for 1 h at room temperature. Excess of [γ-32P]ATP was removed by washing in 5% trichloroacetic acid, 1% sodium pyrophosphate. Gels are stained with Gelcode Blue, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Wild-type γ-PAK, constitutively active γ-PAK-T402E, and kinase-deficient γ-PAK-K278R were subcloned with an N-terminal EGFP tag into the retroviral expression vector pRev-TRE. Expression of EGFP-tagged γ-PAK is controlled by the Tet-response element (TRE) upstream of a minimal CMV promoter. A reversed tetracycline-controlled transactivator is expressed from a second retroviral vector pRevTet-On. After addition of tetracycline or doxycycline to the culture medium, the reversed tetracycline-controlled transactivator binds to the TRE and induces expression of recombinant γ-PAK. Recombinant retroviruses were obtained with the 293T cell-derived ecotropic packaging cell line Phoenix Eco. The use of the retroviral system has the advantage that constructs are efficiently transduced into populations of cells rather than a few selected clones, which may show unspecific effects due to disruption or activation of genes by the integration into the host genome. BALB3T3 mouse fibroblasts were transduced with pRevTet-On and selected with Geneticin to obtain a stable BALB3T3-On cell population, which expressed the reversed tetracycline-controlled transactivator. BALB3T3-On cells where then transduced with pRev-TRE containing EGFP-tagged wild-type γ-PAK, constitutively active γ-PAK-T402E, kinase-deficient γ-PAK-K278R, or the EGFP-tag alone. Stable cell populations for the expression of EGFP-γ-PAK, EGFP-γ-PAK-T402E, EGFP-γ-PAK-K278R, or EGFP alone were obtained by selection with hygromycin B. To determine the optimal concentration and incubation time for the induction of expression, EGFP-γ-PAK-T402E cells were treated with increasing amounts of doxycycline. Expression was monitored by fluorescence microscopy and by Western blot with an anti-EGFP antibody (Fig. 1). Without addition of doxycycline, a basal level of EGFP-γ-PAK-T402E was observed, which might be due to translation from transcripts initiated by the 5′-viral long terminal repeat. The expression was stimulated with increasing amounts of doxycycline and reached saturation at ∼2 μg/ml. Doxycycline-stimulated expression increased with time and reached a steady-state level at ∼48 h (data not shown). Similar results were obtained for EGFP-γ-PAK, EGFP-γ-PAK-K278R, and EGFP alone. Therefore, expression was stimulated with 2 μg/ml doxycycline for 48 h in all subsequent experiments. Because basal levels were present without addition of doxycycline, BALB3T3-On cells, which contain only the pRevTet-On vector, were used as controls rather than uninduced cells. Protein kinase activity of recombinant wild-type and mutant EGFP-tagged γ-PAK was determined by immunoprecipitation and immunocomplex protein kinase assays (Fig. 2). BALB3T3 cells expressing EGFP-γ-PAK, EGFP-γ-PAK-T402E, EGFP-γ-PAK-K278R, or EGFP alone, which were dividing at approximately the same time intervals of 22 h, were grown to ∼70% confluency. Cells were lysed, and EGFP-γ-PAK, EGFP-γ-PAK-T402E, EGFP-γ-PAK-K278R, or EGFP alone were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-EGFP antibody using equal amounts of cell lysate protein. Equal amounts of cell lysate protein and equal aliquots of immunoprecipitate for each construct were analyzed by Western blot with a monoclonal anti-EGFP antibody (Fig. 2 A). The Western blot showed a specific protein band of 85 kDa for EGFP-γ-PAK, EGFP-γ-PAK-T402E, and EGFP-γ-PAK-K278R and of 27 kDa for EGFP in the cell lysates and the immunoprecipitates. Approximately equal amounts of EGFP fusion protein was detected with the different constructs. This suggests that EGFP-γ-PAK, EGFP-γ-PAK-T402E, and EGFP-γ-PAK-K278R are expressed at very similar levels in BALB3T3 fibroblasts. Equal aliquots of immunoprecipitate from cells expressing EGFP-γ-PAK, EGFP-γ-PAK-T402E, and EGFP-γ-PAK-K278R were assayed for autophosphorylation and activity toward histone 4 (Fig. 2, Band C). Samples without immunoprecipitate were used as controls and subtracted from the activity values. Activation of γ-PAK involves autophosphorylation at Thr-402 in the activation loop (30Walter B.N.

Once γ-PAK is activated, autophosphorylation also occurs at several serine residues in the regulatory domain, and exogenous substrates such as histone 4 and myelin basic protein can be phosphorylated. No autophosphorylation and low levels of histone 4 phosphorylation were observed with the kinase-deficient EGFP-γ-PAK-K278R in the absence and presence of Cdc42(GTPγS). The low level of histone 4 phosphorylation with the EGFP-γ-PAK-K278R immunoprecipitate could be due to co-precipitating protein kinases, including endogenous γ-PAK. EGFP-γ-PAK showed a low basal level of autophosphorylation and no significant increase in phosphorylation of histone 4 as compared with kinase-deficient EGFP-γ-PAK-K278R. Addition of Cdc42(GTPγS) enhanced autophosphorylation and increased phosphorylation of histone 4 by 2- to 3-"

In studying whether neuregulins regulate glucose uptake in muscle, we analyzed the effect of a recombinant neuregulin,rheregulin-β1-(177–244) (HRG), on L6E9 muscle cells, which express the neuregulin receptors ErbB2 and ErbB3. L6E9 responded acutely to HRG by a time- and concentration-dependent stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake. HRG-induced stimulation of glucose transport was additive to the effect of insulin. The acute stimulation of the glucose transport induced by HRG was a consequence of the translocation of GLUT4, GLUT1, and GLUT3 glucose carriers to the cell surface. The effect of HRG on glucose transport was dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. HRG also stimulated glucose transport in the incubated soleus muscle and was additive to the effect of insulin. Chronic exposure of L6E9 cells to HRG potentiated myogenic differentiation, and under these conditions, glucose transport was also stimulated. The activation of glucose transport after chronic HRG exposure was due to enhanced cell content of GLUT1 and GLUT3 and to increased abundance of these carriers at the plasma membrane. However, under these conditions, GLUT4 expression was markedly down-regulated. Muscle denervation is associated with GLUT1 induction and GLUT4 repression. In this connection, muscle denervation caused a marked increase in the content of ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors, which occurred in the absence of alterations in neuregulin mRNA levels. This fact suggests that neuregulins regulate glucose transporter expression in denervated muscle. We conclude that neuregulins regulate glucose uptake in L6E9 muscle cells by mechanisms involving the recruitment of glucose transporters to the cell surface and modulation of their expression. Neuregulins may also participate in the adaptations in glucose transport that take place in the muscle fiber after denervation.

Ramlal T. Rastogi S. Bilan P.J. Cartee G.D. Vranic M. Holloszy J.O. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13427-13430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GLUT1 is highly expressed in fetal muscle, but during perinatal life it is markedly repressed, whereas GLUT4 is induced (2Santalucı́a T. Camps M. Castelló A. Muñoz P. Nuel A. Testar X.

Furthermore, GLUT4 is more sensitive than GLUT1 to the lack of muscle contraction (5Henriksen E.J. Rodnick K.J. Mondon C.E. James D.E. Holloszy J.O. J. Appl.

More than 15 distinct isoforms arise by alternative splicing and cell type-specific transcription initiation sites (reviewed in Refs. 18Lemke G. Mol. Cell.

Two major groups can be distinguished on the basis of whether they are membrane-associated or soluble isoforms. The first group of neuregulins contain a transmembrane domain and a cytosolic tail, reside as membrane proteins, and are released to the extracellular milieu after proteolytic cleavage. Most of the released forms contain an N-terminal Ig-like domain that binds to the glycosaminoglycan portion of proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix. Common to all isoforms, there is a C-terminal EGF1-like domain defined by six cysteine residues that fold the domain into compact, protease-resistant β-sheets by forming three disulfide bonds. The EGF-like domain is sufficient to elicit biological responses. After proteolysis, the EGF-like domain is released and binds to members of the ErbB family of tyrosine kinase receptors, ErbB3 (HER3) and ErbB4 (HER4). ErbB4 shows ligand-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity. ErbB3, however, is a tyrosine kinase-deficient receptor because an aspartate and a glutamate in the kinase domain that are critical for autophosphorylation are replaced by other residues. Neuregulin binding to ErbB3 signals through heterodimerization with ErbB2 (HER2, c-neu), which displays tyrosine kinase activity (20Carraway K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 21Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L.

Yarden Y. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and generation of knockout mice has demonstrated that they are essential for the development of cranial nerve, ganglia, and Schwann cell precursors along peripheral nerves in the trunk (23Meyer D. Birchmeier C. Nature. 1995; 378: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). In the hearts of mutant embryos for neuregulin, ErbB2 and ErbB4, ventricular trabeculation does not occur, which results in developmental arrest and embryo death at embryonic day 10.5 (23Meyer D.

Neuregulins also affect the biology of skeletal muscle; they are potent activators of the expression of acetylcholine receptors (26Altiok N. Bessereau J.-L. Changeux J.-P.

In addition, the neuregulins GGF2 and NRGα1 activate myogenic differentiation (29Florini J.R. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. Kirk C. Sklar R.M. J. Biol.

In the mature muscle fiber, ErbB2 and ErbB3 are concentrated at the neuromuscular junction, and therefore it is thought that neuregulins regulate the protein composition and the functioning of the neuromuscular junction (26Altiok N.

Here we examined the effects of the neuregulinrheregulin-β1-(177–244) on glucose uptake in L6E9 muscle cells and the mechanism involved. Our results indicate that HRG stimulates glucose transport and translocates glucose transporters to the cell surface in muscle cells. Additionally, chronic exposure to HRG also stimulates glucose transport and causes alteration of the expression pattern of glucose transporters in muscle cells. Our data are compatible with a model in which neuregulins regulate glucose disposal in or near the neuromuscular junction in innervated muscle fiber. In addition, neuregulin may also participate in the adaptations in glucose uptake that take place in the muscle fiber after denervation.

Anti-IRAP and anti-SCAMPs antibodies (3F8) were kindly provided by Dr. Paul Pilch (Boston University, Boston, MA). Anti-VAMP2 and anti-cellubrevin antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Joan Blasi (Universitat de Barcelona). Tissue culture material was purchased from Corning Inc. L6E9 myoblasts were grown in monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) antibiotics (10,000 units/ml of penicillin G and 10 mg/ml streptomycin), 2 mm glutamine, and 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). Pre-confluent myoblast (80–90%) were induced to differentiate by lowering FBS to final concentration of 2% (v/v). To analyze the acute effect of HRG on glucose transport and transporters, fully differentiated myotubes were depleted of serum containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 4.5 h. 90 min before the end of this period, HRG was added (except in the time course experiments), and when insulin action was studied, it was added for the last 30 min of this period. For the chronic HRG treatment, HRG was added 24 h after the cells were changed to the low serum medium, and studies were carried out after 1, 2, or 3 days of HRG treatment. Cells were cultured on 6-well plates. Transport (34Kaliman P. Viñals F. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was initiated by washing the cells twice in a transport solution (20 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm pyruvate, pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated for 10 min with a transport solution that contained 0.1 mm2-deoxy-d-glucose and 1 μCi of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose uptake (10 mCi/mmol). To determine background labeling, we incubated the cells for 10 min with ice-cold 50 mm glucose in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (PBS) containing the same specific activity of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose. Uptake was stopped by the addition of 2 volumes of ice-cold 50 mm glucose in PBS. Cells were washed twice in the same solution and disrupted with 0.1m NaOH, 0.1% SDS. Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Protein was determined by the Bradford method. Each condition was run in duplicate or triplicate. Glucose transport was linear during the period assayed (data not shown). Homogenates were obtained from cells cultured on 6-well plates at 2, 3, or 4 days of differentiation with one plate from each group. Cells were placed on ice, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and scraped into 2 ml of PBS. Cells were pelleted at 3,000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer (20 mmHepes, 350 mm NaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.9) containing freshly added protease inhibitors (1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% (v/v) aprotinin). The homogenate was shaken for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant (SN) was collected and kept at −20 °C. For total membrane preparation (35Mitsumoto Y. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4957-4962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 3–4 10-cm dishes were used for each experimental group. Cells were washed and scraped into 10 ml of PBS as described previously and pelleted at 1,000 rpm for 5 min. They were then resuspended in 3 ml/dish of cold homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm sodium azide, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing freshly added protease inhibitors (200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin) and homogenized in a glass Dounce homogenizer (pestle A, 20 strokes). Homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant (SN1) was kept. The pellet was resuspended in 1.5 ml of homogenization buffer/dish, re-homogenized, and centrifuged in the same way. The new pellet was discarded, and the supernatant (SN2) was pooled with SN1 and centrifuged at 190,000 × g for 1 h 10 min. The pellet (total membranes) was collected and resuspended in 250 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. When membrane fractionation was required (35Mitsumoto Y. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4957-4962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cells were cultured on 2–4 15-cm dishes for each experimental group and treated initially as described above. The pooled SN1 and SN2 were centrifuged at 24,000 ×g for 1 h. The pellet, a partially purified plasma membrane (PM) fraction, was resuspended in 500 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and the SN was further centrifuged at 190,000 × g for 1 h. The new pellet, a low density fraction (LDM) of intracellular origin, was resuspended in 200 μl of Hepes solution. Cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes. After treatments, cells were washed twice in cold PBS, and 1 mm ZnSO4 in 20% dimethyl sulfoxide was added at room temperature and incubated for 1 min. Cells were then washed gently in cold PBS and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 2 min. Cells were then treated for 1 min with 50% ethanol and rinsed with PBS before staining with filtered 0.04% Giemsa in PBS, pH 6.8, overnight. Finally, cells were rinsed with tap water. Under an optical microscope, several randomly chosen fields were photographed, and the nuclei per cell were counted. For studies of incubated soleus muscle, male Wistar rats (250 g) were anesthetized with pentobarbital, 5–7 mg/100 g of body weight, and strips were isolated by a modification of the method of Crettaz et al. (36Crettaz M. Prentki M. Zaninetti D. Jeanrenaud B. Biochem. J. 1980; 186: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For denervation studies, the peroneal nerve of anesthetized male rats (ketamine, 20 mg/kg of body weight) was severed unilaterally. Three days after denervation, tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus muscles were dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the local ethics committee. Muscles were processed to obtain total membranes as reported previously (37Gumà A. Zierath J.R. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E613-E622PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated strips of soleus muscles were incubated as reported (38Gumà A. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). HRG (3 nm, 120 min) was added after 30 min of muscle incubation, and 1 h later, insulin (100 nm, 60 min) was added to the medium. Previous to the uptake period, muscles were washed for 10 min with a glucose-depleted medium. Thereafter, muscles were incubated in the presence of 2-deoxy-d-[14C]glucose uptake (1 mCi/mmol) and d-[3H]mannitol (0.5 mCi/mmol), as an extracellular space marker, for 20 min, the time in which linear conditions are maintained. Muscles were then frozen and processed as reported (38Gumà A. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on membrane protein. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon in buffer consisting of 20% methanol, 200 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3. After transfer, the filters were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline solution for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies directed against GLUT4 (1:800), GLUT1 (1: 1300), GLUT3 (1:500), ErbB3 (1:500), ErbB2 (1:500), myosin heavy chain (1:20), α1-subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase (1:100), IRAP (1/1000), SCAMPs (1/3000), VAMP2 (1/1000), and cellubrevin (1/500), all diluted in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.067% (w/v) sodium azide in Tris-buffered saline, 0.09% (v/v) Tween 20. The immune complex was detected using an ECL chemiluminescence system. The autoradiograms were quantified using scanning densitometry. Immunoblots were performed in conditions in which autoradiographic detection was in the linear response range. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA at 20 μl of final reaction volume the using SuperScript II Rnase H− Reverse Transcriptase System (Life Technologies, Inc.). (dT)15 was used as the primer at 0.4 μm. Genomic contamination was monitored by enzyme-free controls. The resulting cDNA was diluted 1/10, and 1 μl of this dilution was amplified by PCR in an MJ Research PT-100 thermocycler at 25 μl final reaction volume. PCR primers 5′-TCAGAGCTTCGAATTAACAAAGC-′3 and 5′-GTGGTCATGGCTGATAGATAC CT-′3 (Life Technologies, Inc.), corresponding to 627–649 and 1608–1630 base pairs, respectively, of rat NDF (sequence with total identity to all neuregulin isoforms) were added at 0.4 μm and dNTPs at 0.2 mm. 1.25 units of Taq Expand High Fidelity and its corresponding buffer with Mg2+ were used (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PCR was performed as follows: an initial step of 3 min at 94 °C; 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; and a final step of 5 min at 72 °C. Nonsaturating conditions were ensured by previous assays with the same cDNAs samples subjected to different number of PCR cycles (20 to 35) and in which the maintenance of linearity was determined (data not shown). For electrophoretic analysis, 5 μl of the final reaction volume was loaded in 1.5% agarose gel. As a first step, we assayed the level of neuregulin receptors ErbB2 and ErbB3 in total membrane extracts obtained from L6E9 myoblasts and cells after 2 and 3 days of differentiation induced by exposure to low serum conditions (Fig.1). The ErbB2 content was maximal in myoblasts, and expression was somewhat reduced during differentiation. In contrast, ErbB3 levels were low in myoblasts but rose during differentiation (a 2-fold increase on day 3 of differentiation) (Fig.1). Under these conditions, the abundance of the α1subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase remained unaltered, indicating that the pattern of changes detected for neuregulin receptors was specific. Our results indicate the presence of neuregulin receptors in L6E9 muscle cells, which is consistent with reports in different muscle cell lines (25Gassman M. Casagranda F. Orioli D. Simon H. Lai C. Klein R. Lemke G. Nature. 1995; 378: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 32Moscoso L.M. Chu G.C. Gautman M. Noakes P.G. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 158-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Fully differentiated L6E9 myotubes were incubated with different concentrations of HRG for 90 min (Fig. 2 A). HRG stimulated glucose transport with half-maximal effects detected at 2 nm HRG and maximal effects (2–2.5-fold stimulation of glucose transport) observed between 3 and 5 nm HRG, which is consistent with other reports on the effects of neuregulins (26Altiok N. Bessereau J.-L. Changeux J.-P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4258-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 30Kim D. Chi S. Lee K.H. Rhee S. Kwon Y.K. Chung C.H. Kwon H. Kang M.-S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10367-10371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Time course studies were also performed at maximal concentrations of HRG (3 nm) (Fig. 2 B). The maximal effect of HRG on glucose transport was reached between 60 and 90 min of incubation. The effect of a maximal concentration of HRG (3 nm for 90 min) on glucose transport was comparable with the effect caused by a supramaximal concentration of insulin (1 μm for 30 min) (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, the combination of HRG and insulin caused an additive stimulation of glucose transport (Fig.2 C). To determine whether the effect of HRG on glucose transport required phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, wortmannin (1 μm) (40Tsakiridis T. McDowell H. Walker T. Downes C.P. Hunda H.S. Vranic M. Klip A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was added 30 min prior to HRG. Insulin-stimulated glucose transport was inhibited by wortmannin, and under these conditions wortmannin also blocked HRG-induced glucose transport (Fig.3). Incubation of L6E9 myotubes for 90 min in the presence of HRG did not alter the cell content of GLUT4, GLUT1, or GLUT3 (data not shown). In the next step, L6E9 myotubes were incubated in the absence or presence of 3 nm HRG for 90 min and then were further subjected to subcellular fractionation of membranes. This yielded two membrane fractions: PM, which were highly enriched in plasma membrane markers such as the α1 subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase, and LDM, which are of intracellular origin. A typical experiment starting with four 15-cm dishes yielded ∼3–5 mg of membrane proteins in the PM fraction and 0.5–1.5 mg of membrane proteins in the LDM fraction. Incubation of cells for 90 min in the presence of HRG caused a 43% increase in the abundance of GLUT4 in PM fractions and a 50% decrease in GLUT4 in LDMs (Fig. 4, A and B), consistent with HRG-induced GLUT4 translocation.

Accordingly, hypochlorite-modified (lipo)proteins have been detected in human atherosclerotic lesions where they colocalize with macrophages and endothelial cells. The present study investigates the influence of hypochlorite-modified LDL on endothelial synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) measured as formation of citrulline (coproduct of NO) and cGMP (product of the NO-activated soluble guanylate cyclase) upon cell stimulation with thrombin or ionomycin. Pretreatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with hypochlorite-modified LDL led to a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of agonist-induced citrulline and cGMP synthesis compared with preincubation of cells with native LDL. This inhibition was neither due to a decreased expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) nor to a deficiency of its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin. Likewise, the uptake of l-arginine, the substrate of eNOS, into the cells was not affected. Hypochlorite-modified LDL caused remarkable changes of intracellular eNOS distribution including translocation from the plasma membrane and disintegration of the Golgi location without altering myristoylation or palmitoylation of the enzyme. In contrast, cyclodextrin known to deplete plasma membrane of cholesterol and to disrupt caveolae induced only a disappearance of eNOS from the plasma membrane that was not associated with decreased agonist-induced citrulline and cGMP formation. The present findings suggest that mislocalization of NOS accounts for the reduced NO formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with hypochlorite-modified LDL and point to an important role of Golgi-located NOS in these processes. We conclude that inhibition of NO synthesis by hypochlorite-modified LDL may be an important mechanism in the development of endothelial dysfunction and early pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

Nitric oxide (NO)1 is generated in endothelial cells from the conversion ofl-arginine to l-citrulline by the enzymatic action of an NADPH-dependent NO synthase (NOS) which requires tetrahydrobiopterin, FAD, and FMN as cofactors (1Mayer B. Hemmens B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 477-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Endothelial NOS (eNOS) is constitutively expressed and activated upon an increase of intracellular Ca2+ following cell stimulation with agonists such as thrombin and bradykinin or through serine phosphorylation subsequent to cell stimulation with shear stress or insulin (2Busse R.

Interestingly, inhibition of dual acylation or mutation of the palmitoylation sites leading to an attenuation of Golgi or caveolae targeting, respectively, were both associated with an impaired cellular NO synthesis (7Sessa W.C.

Endothelium-derived NO exerts vasodilatory, growth regulatory, and antithrombotic activities thus being an important regulator of cardiovascular homeostasis (22Ignarro L.J. Cirino G. Casini A. Napoli C. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1999; 34: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Evidence is accumulating that NO determines the anti-atherosclerotic properties of the endothelium (23Bult H. Herman A.G. Matthys K.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All major risk factors for atherosclerosis including hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and smoking have been associated with impaired vascular NO synthesis (24Cooke J.P. Dzau V.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 489-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). An increasing number of studies suggest that oxidized/modified low density lipoprotein (LDL), which is considered to play a key role in the development of atherosclerosis, may regulate the availability of NO (25Heinecke J.W. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 141: 1-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Oxidized LDL (oxLDL) has been shown to inhibit the NO-mediated endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation (26Kugiyama K. Kerns S.A. Morrisett J.D. Roberts R. Henry P.D.

The underlying mechanisms are thought to involve the uncoupling of Gi protein-dependent signal transduction (29Liao J.K. Clark S.L. J. Clin.

Circulation. 2000; 101: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) or a decrease in eNOS-mRNA stability and eNOS expression (34Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol.

Recent findings suggest that inhibition of endothelial NO formation by oxLDL may also be related to an alteration of subcellular eNOS localization. Blair et al. (36Blair A. Shaul P.W. Yuhanna I.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32512-32519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) showed that an acute treatment of endothelial cells with oxLDL depleted caveolae of cholesterol and caused eNOS and caveolin-1 to translocate from the plasma membrane without affecting palmitoylation, myristoylation, or phosphorylation of the enzyme. Concomitantly, acetylcholine-induced activation of the enzyme was impaired. Most studies investigating the effects of oxLDL used Cu2+-oxidized LDL as an experimental model. In contrast, there appears to be little evidence that free metal ions play an important role in the early development of atherosclerosis (25Heinecke J.W. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 141: 1-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The analysis of stable oxidation products in the human artery wall suggests that oxidation of LDL may rather involve the 15-lipoxygenase pathway, reactive nitrogen species, or myeloperoxidase-initiated reactions (25Heinecke J.W. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 141: 1-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Myeloperoxidase is released by activated neutrophils or monocytes and is catalyzing the reaction of H2O2 with Cl−, resulting in the formation of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) (37Klebanoff S.J. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1999; 111: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This potent oxidant is thought to play an important role during microbial killing and to contribute to inflammatory tissue injury and atherogenesis. HOCl has been shown to oxidize LDL in vitro thereby generating a particle that caused foam cell formation (38Hazell L.J. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), stimulation of neutrophil adherence to endothelial cells (39Kopprasch S. Leonhardt W. Pietzsch J. Kuhne H.

HOCl-modified epitopes have also been shown to colocalize with myeloperoxidase in lesion material including endothelial cells (44Malle E. Waeg G. Schreiber R. Gröne E.F. Sattler W. Gröne H.J. Eur.

In the present study we investigated the effects of hypochlorite-modified LDL on NO formation, eNOS protein and mRNA expression as well as subcellular localization of eNOS in human endothelial cells. We demonstrate that hypochlorite-modified LDL causes an inhibition of agonist-stimulated NO synthesis without altering the expression of eNOS, tetrahydrobiopterin availability, or arginine uptake into the cells. The reduced NO formation was associated with a striking intracellular redistribution of eNOS including the reduction of the enzyme in the plasma membrane and a disintegration of the perinuclear Golgi localization. Our data additionally underline the functional importance of Golgi-targeted eNOS since cyclodextrin that exclusively caused translocation of plasmalemmal eNOS did not inhibit cellular NO formation. Plasticware for cell culture was from Greiner Labortechnik (Frickenhausen, Germany).

Tran35S-label (>1000 Ci/mmol) and methionine-free RPMI medium were from ICN Biomedical Research Products (Costa Mesa, CA); En3Hance solution was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; nitrocellulose was from Millipore (Eschborn, Germany); specific antibodies against human eNOS (monoclonal, clone 3) and human caveolin-1 (monoclonal, clone C060, or rabbit polyclonal) were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); the monoclonal antibody against giantin was a kind gift of Dr. Hauri (University of Basel, Switzerland); the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase complex (mouse monoclonal) and the bridging antibody rabbit anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Dako (Hamburg, Germany); the polyclonal antibody against human eNOS was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); and the fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies (Cy-3- and Cy-2-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG, suitable for multilabeling) were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). The protease inhibitor mixture Complete, EDTA-free, and an enzymatic test for the determination of cholesterol were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Sepiapterin, l-nitroarginine methyl ester (l-NAME), and the cDNA probe for human eNOS were from Alexis Corp. (Läufelfingen, Switzerland). Endothelial cell growth supplement, peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Fab-specific), anti-mouse agarose, FAD, FMN, calmodulin, ionomycin, thrombin, EDTA, EGTA, trypsin/EDTA solution (0.05/0.02%, v/v), leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), dithiothreitol (DTT), methyl-β-cyclodextrin and other reagents were obtained from Sigma. The composition of the Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) was as follows: 10 mm Hepes, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, 1.5 mm CaCl2. The solubilization buffer contained 100 mm NaOH, 2% Na2CO3, and 1% SDS. A protease inhibitor mixture stock solution was prepared by dissolving 1 tablet in 0.5 ml of 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and stored at −20 °C. Human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were prepared with 0.05% collagenase and cultured in 75-cm2 plastic flasks in M199 containing 15% fetal calf serum, 5% HS, and 7.5 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement. Confluent cultures were detached by trypsin/EDTA and plated on glass coverslips for immunohistochemical stainings, on 30 mm-diameter wells for the purpose of cGMP determination, on 60 mm-diameter dishes for the measurement of citrulline formation, [14C]arginine uptake, and incorporation of labeled compounds, and on 90 mm-diameter dishes for the investigation of the other parameters. Experiments were carried out with monolayers of the first to second passage. Plasma from normolipemic human volunteers was collected in tubes containing 1 mg/ml EDTA. LDL (d 1.035–1.065 g/ml) was isolated by ultracentrifugation as described (50Malle E. Hazell L. Stocker R. Sattler W. Esterbauer H. Waeg G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 982-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). LDL samples were stored under argon and used within 10 days following isolation. Prior to its modification LDL was desalted; low molecular mass compounds were removed by dialysis, and LDL was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The concentration of the reagent NaOCl was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar absorption coefficient for OCl− of 350 cm− 1 at 292 nm. One mg of LDL protein/ml of PBS was incubated (1 h, 4 °C, under argon) with NaOCl solution at molar ratios of NaOCl to LDL, ranging from 50 (100 μm NaOCl) to 400 (800 μm NaOCl) with the final pH adjusted to 7.4. The modified LDL preparations were passed over a PD-10 column to remove unreacted NaOCl. Characterization of NaOCl-modified LDL revealed that an increasing molar NaOCl:LDL ratio led to an increased relative electrophoretic mobility and a decreased percentage of free ε-amino groups up to 75% as described previously (41Opper C. Schüssler G. Sattler W. Malle E. Platelets. 1998; 9: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Preincubation of HUVEC with native LDL (nLDL) or NaOCl-modified LDL (NaOCl-LDL) suspended in Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) was performed in culture medium for 1–24 h. The indicated amounts of LDL used in the experiments were based upon the LDL protein concentration. If not otherwise announced, NaOCl-LDL modified at a molar NaOCl:LDL ratio of 400:1 was used. Neither nLDL nor modified LDL affected endothelial cell viability which was determined by trypan blue exclusion and ranged from 95 to 98% under the different conditions described. None of the tested native or modified lipoproteins altered the growth behavior of endothelial cells or their capability of protein synthesis as estimated by incorporation of [3H]thymidine or 14C-labeled amino acids, respectively. Furthermore, no evidence of endothelial cell apoptosis was seen when nLDL or NaOCl-LDL were added to culture medium at the indicated concentrations and modifications, which was measured by the cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Sepiapterin was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Stimulation of HUVEC with ionomycin or thrombin was performed in the absence of lipoproteins and sepiapterin. Ionomycin was dissolved at 1 mm in Me2SO and stored at −20 °C until used. The final concentration of Me2SO during experimental incubations and cell stimulation did not exceed 0.1%, and control cells received the same volume addition of solvent. Endothelial cells cultured on coverslips were fixed for 10 min in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with methanol. Nonpermeabilized cells were used as a control. HOCl-modified epitopes were detected with the three-step alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase method (51Erber W.N. Mynheer L.C. Mason D.Y. Lancet. 1986; 1: 761-765Abstract PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A hybridoma cell line supernatant (clone 2D10G9, 1:10) containing a monoclonal antibody that had been raised against HOCl-modified LDL (50Malle E. Hazell L. Stocker R. Sattler W. Esterbauer H. Waeg G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 982-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) was used as a primary antibody. Nuclei were counterstained for 10 min with hematoxylin. Citrulline synthesis was measured by a modification of a technique described previously (52Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9030-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell monolayers were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 1.5 ml of Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.25% HSA. Subsequently, cells were stimulated with 2 μm ionomycin or 1 unit/ml thrombin in the presence of 10 μm l-arginine and 3.3 μCi/ml l-[3H]arginine. The reaction was stopped after 15 min with ice-cold PBS containing 5 mm l-arginine and 4 mm EDTA, and the cells were denaturated with 96% ethanol. After evaporation, the soluble cellular components were dissolved in 20 mm Hepes-Na (pH 5.5) and applied to 2-ml columns of Dowex AG50WX-8 (Na+ form). The radioactivity corresponding to the [3H]citrulline content of the eluate was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Agonist-induced [3H]citrulline production was calculated from the difference in radioactivity from unstimulated and ionomycin- or thrombin-stimulated cells and was expressed in fmol/mg cell protein. Basal [3H]citrulline synthesis was determined from thel-NAME (1 mm, 30 min preincubation)-inhibitable radioactivity in unstimulated cells and was not always detectable. HUVEC monolayers were incubated for 30 min in M199 containing 0.25% HSA and 0.5 mmisobutylmethylxanthine. Subsequently, the cells were stimulated with 2 μm ionomycin or 1 unit/ml thrombin for 15 min. The reaction was stopped with 96% ethanol. When the ethanol had evaporated, 0.3 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris, 4 mmEDTA (pH 7.5)) were applied. The cGMP content of 100 μl of cellular extract was measured by radioimmunoassay following the instructions of the manufacturer. The intracellular cGMP concentration was expressed in pmol/mg cell protein. The agonist-induced cGMP production was determined from the difference of cGMP content in ionomycin- or thrombin-stimulated cells and the corresponding unstimulated cells. HUVEC were incubated in culture medium containing 335 μm l-[14C]arginine (3 mCi/mmol). After various times, incubations were stopped by washing the cells with ice-cold Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm l-arginine. HUVEC were lysed with solubilization buffer; an aliquot of the lysate was taken to determine the protein content; and the radioactivity of the remaining sample was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Total RNA from HUVEC was extracted according to Chirgwinet al. (53Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.M. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar), quantified by UV spectroscopy at 260 nm, and electrophoretically resolved on 1% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gels (15 μg RNA per lane). RNA was transferred to HybondTM-XL membranes by vacuum blotting and covalently linked by ultraviolet irradiation (DNA cross-linker, Whatman Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). Subsequently, blots were stained with methylene blue and scanned. The 18 S rRNA bands were taken as indicators for equal RNA loading. Blots were prehybridized and hybridized overnight at 42 °C with 2 × 106 cpm/ml of a [32P]dCTP-labeled fragment of human eNOS-cDNA according to standard protocols. Radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography at −80 °C for 20 h. HUVEC were detached by trypsin/EDTA and suspended in a small volume of Hepes/sorbitol buffer (10 mmHepes, 340 mm sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 0.6 mmleupeptin, and 0.025 mm pepstatin (pH 7.4)). For preparation of a particulate and a cytosolic fraction, cell suspensions were sonicated on ice and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 ×g and 4 °C. Proteins were solubilized by boiling the cells as well as the soluble and particulate fractions in Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7% gels (cell lysates, particulate, and cytosolic fractions) or on 5–15% gradient gels (plasma membrane-enriched fractions, immunoprecipitates) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Subsequently, blots were subjected to immunostaining with monoclonal antibodies against human eNOS (1:250, 1.5 h) or against human caveolin-1 (1:250, 1.5 h). After an incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000, 1.5 h), visualization of NOS or caveolin-1 was achieved using the ECL technique. HUVEC cultured on glass coverslips were fixed for 10 min at 4 °C with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 5% goat serum in PBS containing 0.06% saponin for permeabilization. Cells were then incubated for 30 min with primary antibodies against eNOS (mouse monoclonal 1:200 or rabbit polyclonal 1:200), caveolin-1 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:200), and the Golgi marker protein gian"
https://openalex.org/W2074592106,"Stat3 is a latent transcription factor activated by various cytokines and growth factors. Phosphorylation on Tyr-705 is a prerequisite for dimer formation, nuclear translocation, binding to its cognate DNA sequences, and regulation of the target gene transcription. Ser-727 phosphorylation of Stat3 plays an additional role in the regulation of transcription. MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MAPKKK) that activates the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase signaling pathway. Here we report that MEKK1 is involved in the regulation of Stat3 activation by growth factors. Kinase-inactive MEKK1 inhibits Stat3 phosphorylation on tyrosine and serine, and its transcriptional activity stimulated by epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor in different cell types. In contrast, active MEKK1 induces Stat3 tyrosine and serine phosphorylation leading to a functionally active Stat3 capable of binding DNA and enhancing transcription. Ser-727 is phosphorylated by MEKK1 in vitro, whereas Tyr-705 phosphorylation induced by MEKK1 involves Src and Janus kinases in vivo. These data demonstrate for the first time a novel role of MEKK1 to modulate tyrosine kinases that results in the activation of specific members of STAT family."

This process depends primarily on the exocytosis of a specialized pool of vesicles containing GLUT4 in their membranes. The mechanism of GLUT4 vesicle exocytosis in response to insulin is not understood. To determine whether GLUT4 exocytosis is dependent on intact microtubule network, we measured insulin-mediated GLUT4 exocytosis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in which the microtubule network was depolymerized by pretreatment with nocodazole. Insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation was inhibited by more than 80% in nocodazole-treated cells.

An intact microtubule network is specifically required for insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation since nocodazole treatment did not affect insulin-mediated GLUT1 translocation or adipsin secretion. By using in vitro microtubule binding, we demonstrated that both GLUT4 vesicles and IRS-1 bind specifically to microtubules, implicating microtubules in both insulin signaling and GLUT4 translocation.

Several lines of evidence have shown that the effect of insulin on glucose uptake in these tissues is a direct result of the recruitment of the GLUT41 facilitative glucose transporter from an intracellular vesicle pool to the plasma membrane (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Olson A.L.

GLUT4 was first implicated as the major insulin-responsive glucose transporter when it was shown to be the predominant isoform expressed in tissues exhibiting insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (3James D.E.

Prior to the cloning and identification of GLUT4, it was known that insulin stimulated the redistribution of a cytochalasin D-inhibitable glucose transport activity from an intracellular vesicle pool to the plasma membrane (7Cushman S.W.

It is generally accepted that the translocatable glucose transport activity is attributable to GLUT4 recruited from an intracellular location to the plasma membrane. GLUT4 recycles between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments in both the basal and insulin-stimulated states (9Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol.

Insulin increases the amount of GLUT4 on the plasma membrane by stimulating exocytosis of the intracellular GLUT4 pool and by decreasing the endocytosis of the plasma membrane-associated GLUT4 protein (10Satoh S.

Increased exocytosis appears to be the most important event since complete inhibition of the GLUT4 endocytic pathway in the basal state does not result in a significant accumulation of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane (18Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These data support a model in which a small portion of the total pool of GLUT4 recycles in the basal state, with the majority of GLUT4 sequestered in an insulin-responsive retention pool shown to be associated with tubulovesicular structures (19Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which GLUT4 vesicles move from their interior location to the plasma membrane in response to insulin is poorly understood. To date, research in this area has focused largely on docking and fusion of the vesicles at the plasma membrane. SNARE (forsoluble NSF attachment proteinreceptor) proteins have been shown to play an important role in the fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane. It has been clearly demonstrated that syntaxin 4, VAMP2, and Syndet/SNAP23 are the major SNARE proteins regulating GLUT4 membrane fusion (20Cheatham B. Volchuk A. Kahn C.R. Wang L. Rhodes C.J.

Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), but it is not clear that assembly of SNARE proteins is a rate-limiting step in insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation. Measurement of GLUT4 translocation in the presence of a temperature-sensitive Munc18c mutant indicates that membrane fusion is not rate-limiting in GLUT4 translocation (32Thurmond D.C. Pessin J.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3565-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These data suggest that mechanisms regulating the movement of vesicles from the retention pool to the plasma membrane need to be explored to determine the specific steps in GLUT4 translocation that are regulated by insulin. Regulated insulin-dependent trafficking of GLUT4 vesicles from the retention pool to the plasma membrane may occur by several mechanisms. GLUT4 vesicles may pass through an endosomal intermediate en route to the plasma membrane. This is unlikely, based on data demonstrating that depletion of the endosomal compartment does not interfere with insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation (33Martin L. Shewan A. Millar C.A. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1444-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 34Millar C.A. Meerloo T. Martin S. Hickson G.R.X. Shimwell N.J. Wakelam M.J.O. James D.E. Gould G.W. Traffic. 2000; 1: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Alternatively, GLUT4 vesicle trafficking may be regulated by cytoskeletal elements. GLUT4 secretory vesicles may be tethered to cytoskeletal structures in a manner similar to endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membrane structures (35Cole N.B. Sciaky N. Marotta A. Song J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 631-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Insulin stimulation could induce a release of tethered vesicles, allowing movement to the plasma membrane by simple diffusion, or insulin may trigger the movement of vesicles along cytoskeletal tracks as has been observed for regulated exocytosis of secretory vesicles in other cell systems (36Hamm-Alvarez S.F. Kim P.Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 955-966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies examining the role of the actin cytoskeleton in GLUT4 translocation in L6 myotubes, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and rat adipocytes show that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by either cytochalasin D or latrunculin A inhibited insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation (37Tsakiridis T. Vranic M. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29934-29942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Wang Q. Bilan P.J. Tsakiridis T. Hinek A. Klip A. Biochem.

In L6 myotubes, disassembly of the actin network did not prevent GLUT4 translocation by stimuli other than insulin, suggesting that the actin cytoskeleton is required for transduction of the insulin signal to GLUT4 vesicles (40Tsakiridis T. Vranic M. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton in 3T3-L1 cells and L6 myotubes did not interfere with proximal insulin signaling events but did prevent the relocalization of PI 3-kinase to GLUT4 vesicles (38Wang Q. Bilan P.J. Tsakiridis T. Hinek A. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 41Khayat Z.A. Tong P. Yaworsky K. Bloch R.J. Klip A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 279-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we provide evidence that the microtubule cytoskeleton is required for insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation. We show that insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation requires an intact microtubule network and that under basal conditions, GLUT4 vesicles associate with polymerized microtubules. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture repository and were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 25 mm glucose and 10% calf serum. Confluent cultures were induced to differentiate by incubation of the cells with DMEM plus 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 175 nm insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. After 4 days, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 175 nm insulin, with the incubation period continuing an additional 3 days. Under these conditions, greater than 95% of the cell population morphologically differentiated into adipocytes. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with drugs to modify the microtubule cytoskeleton were carried out for 3 h in serum-free F-12 Ham's media. Nocodazole was used at a final concentration of 33 μm, and taxol was used at a final concentration of 12 μm. Preparation of plasma membrane sheets was carried out as described previously (23Olson A.L. Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured adipocytes grown in a 6-well cluster dish were treated as described in the figure legends. Following experimental treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and attached to the plate with 0.5% poly-d-lysine. The cells were swollen in hypotonic buffer and then sonicated to release intracellular contents. Pure plasma membrane fragments remaining attached to the plastic dish were scraped into 120 μl of solubilization buffer (1% SDS, 20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Protein content of the plasma membrane sheets was measured in a 10-μl aliquot using a spectrofluorometric assay (42Sogawa K. Takahashi K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1978; 83: 1783-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For this assay, the solubilized protein sample was diluted to 60 μl in solubilization buffer. The diluted sample was mixed with 0.25 ml of 0.2 m sodium borate buffer, pH 9.0, at room temperature for 5 min. A 20-μl aliquot of fluorescamine solution (0.2 mg/ml in acetonitrile) was added with vigorous vortexing. Following a 20-min incubation at room temperature, fluorescence was measured using 395 nm excitation and 460 nm emission at high sensitivity using a Shimadzu RF5000U spectrofluorophotometer. A standard curve was generated using bovine serum albumin ranging from 0.1 to 15 μg/ml. Monomeric and polymeric tubulin were differentially extracted from cells plated on 35-mm dishes according to previous methods (43Breitfeld P.P. McKinnon W.C. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2365-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Following treatments as indicated, cell monolayers were washed 2 times with PBS and then incubated with 0.3 ml of extraction buffer (2 m glycerol, 0.1 m Pipes, pH 7.1, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 mmPMSF, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 30 min at 37 °C. The Triton X-100-soluble extract contains monomeric tubulin. Polymeric tubulin was then extracted from the remaining Triton X-100-insoluble material by extracting in SDS lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.4m NaCl, 0.5% SDS) for 5 min at 37 °C. Aliquots from monomeric and polymeric fractions were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted for β-tubulin. 100-mm plates of treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed twice with ice-cold TBS followed by freezing in liquid nitrogen. The plates were thawed on ice and scraped into 1 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA) containing phosphatase inhibitors (100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm molybdate) and protease inhibitors (10 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.5 mmpepstatin A, and 1 mm PMSF). The cells were lysed on ice for 20 min, and insoluble material was removed by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the detergent lysates were determined by a Bradford protein assay (Pierce) using manufacturer's specifications. Samples were fractionated using SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 193 mm glycine, pH 8.5) for 3–4 A-h at 4 °C. Membranes blotted for insulin receptor β-subunit, IRS-1, GLUT4, IRAP, tubulin, and dynein were blocked with 7–10% dried milk and 0.3% Tween 20 in TBS. Anti-phosphotyrosine blots were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS. Anti-phosphotyrosine blots were carried out using PY99 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). GLUT4 antiserum was provided by Dr. Gwyn Gould, and IRAP antiserum was provided by Dr. Kostantin Kandror. GLUT1 antibody was provided by Dr. Samuel W. Cushman. Tubulin antibody was obtained from Sigma (TUB 2.1). Phospho-PKB/Akt-1 antibody specific for Ser-473 was obtained from New England Biolabs, and antibody against total PKB/Akt-1 was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Immunoblots were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce) and quantified using scanning laser densitometry. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were placed in Ham's F-12 media containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C. Nocodazole was added to a final concentration of 33 μm at designated times. Cell were then washed with KRPH buffer (5 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, and 1% bovine serum albumin) and treated with or without additional nocodazole to prevent repolymerization of microtubules and with or without 100 nm insulin added for 20 min. Glucose transport was determined at 37 °C by incubation with 50 μm 2-deoxyglucose uptake containing 0.5 μCi of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose in the absence or presence of 10 μm cytochalasin B. The reaction was stopped after 4 min by washing the cells 3 times with ice-cold PBS. The cells were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 30 min, and aliquots were subjected to scintillation counting or protein assay to calculate uptake as pmol/min/mg protein. Phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase activity was measured in IRS-1 immune complexes obtained from whole cell detergent lysates as described above. The detergent-soluble cell extract was incubated overnight with anti-IRS-1 pre-loaded on protein A-conjugated Sepharose. Immune complexes were washed and subjected to the in vitro PI 3-kinase assay as described previously using bovine phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates (44Holt K.H. Olson A.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 42-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified by collecting and counting radiolabeled phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. Adipsin secretion into cell culture media was measured as described previously (45Yang C.Z. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25297-25300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thirty five-mm dishes of 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated without or with 33 mmnocodazole for 3 h in serum-free Ham's F-12 media. The cells were washed 2 times with fresh media, followed by replacement with 1 ml of Ham's F-12 media without or with 33 μm nocodazole and/or 100 nm insulin for 30 min. The media were removed, and proteins were precipitated in the presence of 10% trichloroacetic acid and deoxycholate as carrier (46Kitagawa K. Rosen B.S. Spiegelman B.M. Lienhard G.E. Tanner L.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1014: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Pelleted proteins were captured by microcentrifugation and resuspended in 40 μl of 0.25 mTris base. Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay. Equivalent protein aliquots were fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF. Membranes were immunoblotted using an adipsin antibody (provided by Dr. Jess Miner, University of Nebraska). Microtubules and associated proteins were polymerized in vitro as described previously (47Soroka C.J. Pate M.K. Boyer J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26416-26424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes (day 8–10 post-differentiation) were serum-starved in Ham's F-12 media for 3 h and then treated without or with 100 nm insulin for specified times. Cells (from two 100-mm plates per treatment) were scraped into 500 μl of microtubule stabilizing buffer (5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm EGTA, 35 mm PIPES, pH 7.1, and 142 mm sucrose) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 mm PMSF), and phosphatase inhibitors (100 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm molybdate). Cells were homogenized at 4 °C by passage through a 26-guage needle. Homogenates were centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min to obtain the post-nuclear supernatant. The post-nuclear supernatant was subjected to a 40,000 × g centrifugation using an SW60 rotor (Beckman) for 1 h. The supernatant was recovered, and protein concentration was adjusted to 4 mg/ml with homogenization buffer. Taxol (1 mm stock solution in Me2SO) was added to a final concentration of 20 μm, and samples were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Polymerized microtubules and associated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 30 min using an SW60 rotor (Beckman). In some experiments 1% Triton X-100 was added to the 40,000 ×g supernatant prior to addition of taxol to solubilize membranes. The 16,000 × g taxol-stabilized pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer and protein concentration measured by Bradford assay. The 16,000 × gtaxol-stabilized pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane and Western blotting. To determine whether an intact microtubule cytoskeleton is necessary for insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation, we measured GLUT4 translocation in cells treated with 33 μmnocodazole. This concentration depolymerizes greater than 95% of microtubules in other cell types (43Breitfeld P.P. McKinnon W.C. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2365-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To confirm that depolymerization of the microtubule network occurred in 3T3-L1 adipocytes under this treatment, we compared monomeric and polymeric tubulin levels in cells treated without or with 33 μm nocodazole for 3 h by Western blot analysis. Monomeric tubulin was extracted in 0.1% Triton X-100 extraction buffer plus protease inhibitors at 37 °C for 15 min. After the Triton X-100-soluble fraction was removed, polymeric tubulin was extracted with buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl and 0.5% SDS. An equivalent portion of each extract was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and samples were probed with an anti-β-tubulin antibody (Fig. 1 A). Nocodazole treatment shifted greater than 95% polymeric tubulin to the monomeric form (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 2 and 4). In control cells, approximately two-thirds of the total tubulin was polymeric, and the remaining third was monomeric (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 1 and 2). After establishing the efficacy of nocodazole treatment for depolymerization of the microtubule network in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we examined insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation under identical treatment conditions. Insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane was assessed by measuring GLUT4 levels in purified plasma membrane fractions prepared by sonication of monolayers of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (23Olson A.L. Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 48Knight J.B. Cao K.T. Gibson G.V. Olson A.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 208-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Quantification of protein levels in this fraction by Western blot analysis provides an estimate of the accumulation of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane of an entire plate of cells. Cells were treated for 3 h with 33 μmnocodazole followed by treatment without or with 100 nminsulin for 30 min. Isolated plasma membrane fragments were solubilized and analyzed by Western blot. Basal levels of GLUT4 in plasma membrane sheets were not affected by nocodazole treatment (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, nocodazole inhibited recruitment of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane following insulin treatment (p < 0.005) (Fig. 1 B, lanes 7 and8). Quantification of four independent experiments by laser densitometry is shown in Fig. 1 C. In the previous experiment, insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation was measured after 3 h of nocodazole treatment; however, a time course experiment revealed that complete depolymerization of microtubules in 3T3-L1 cells occurred between 15 and 30 min of nocodazole treatment (data not shown). To confirm that the effects of nocodazole on insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation occurred at early time points paralleling microtubule depolymerization, we measured GLUT4 translocation after 20 min of nocodazole treatment (Fig.2 A). Cells were treated with nocodazole for 20 or 120 min prior to insulin treatment and plasma membrane sheets prepared as described above. Results of two independent time course experiments are shown in Fig. 2 A. Densitometric analysis of the Western blot reveals a 4-fold increase in GLUT4 protein following insulin treatment in the absence of nocodazole (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–4). In contrast to control conditions, the insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation was increased 1.4- and 1.6-fold, respectively, in cells treated for 20 and 120 min with nocodazole (Fig.2 A, lanes 5–12). Thus, the effects of nocodazole on insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation do not likely results from progressive changes in the cell that develop overtime in the presence of nocodazole. In a complementary experiment, we measured insulin-mediated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated for 0, 20, or 120 min with 33 μm nocodazole. Insulin treatment caused a 5-fold increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake under control conditions (Fig. 2 B). Nocodazole treatment for both 20 and 120 min significantly inhibited insulin-mediated 2-deoxyglucose uptake, similar to the inhibition of GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 2). Nocodazole treatment of cells significantly reduces microtubule-based vesicle transport; however, it has also been shown to elicit effects on the cell including inhibition of protein synthesis, disruption of plasma membrane subdomains, and changes in some types of cellular signaling (49Hamm-Alvarez S.F. Sheetz M.P. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1109-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Any of these perturbations could lead to changes in early insulin signaling events. To determine whether nocodazole interferes with GLUT4 translocation by decreasing steady state levels of relevant proteins, we measured the levels of insulin receptor, IRS-1, and GLUT4 protein in nocodazole-treated cells. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with 33 μm nocodazole for 3 h and then treated without or with 100 nm insulin for 20 min at 37 °C. Nocodazole did not alter steady state protein levels of IRS-1, insulin receptor β-subunit, or GLUT4 protein (data not shown). The first event in insulin signaling is the activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor upon ligand binding. This leads to both mitogenic and metabolic effects of the cascade. Another early event in insulin signaling is the tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular insulin receptor substrates of the IRS family (50White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphotyrosine residues on the IRS isoforms act as binding sites for specific SH2 domain molecules, including phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI 3-kinase) (50White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol."

To investigate the role of this pathway in NFκB activation, we employed mutated in multiple advanced cancers/phosphatase and tensin homologue (MMAC/PTEN), a natural antagonist of PI 3-kinase activity. Our results show that cytokine-induced DNA binding and transcriptional activities of NFκB were both inhibited in a glioma cell line that was stably transfected with MMAC/PTEN. The ability of interleukin-1 (IL-1) to induce inhibitor (IκB) degradation or nuclear translocation of NFκB was, however, unaffected by MMAC/PTEN expression, suggesting that PI 3-kinase utilizes another equally important mechanism to control NFκB activation. It is conceivable that NFκB is directly phosphorylated through such a mechanism because treatment with protein phosphatase 2A significantly reduced its DNA binding activity. Moreover, IL-1-induced phosphorylation of p50 NFκB was potently inhibited in MMAC/PTEN-expressing cells. Whereas the mediators of NFκB phosphorylation remain to be identified, IL-1 was found to induce physical interactions between the PI 3-kinase target Akt kinase and the IκB·IκB kinase complex. Physical interactions between these proteins were antagonized by MMAC/PTEN consistent with their potential involvement in NFκB activation.

In addition to its role in inflammation, NFκB has also been implicated in cellular survival, transformation, and oncogenesis (1Baldwin A. Annu. Rev.

Predominantly a heterodimeric complex of two polypeptides (p65/RelA and p50), NFκB is physically confined to the cytoplasm through its interactions with inhibitors belonging to the IκB family of proteins (1Baldwin A.

When phosphorylated on serine 32 and serine 36, IκBα is marked and degraded by the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway liberating the NFκB heterodimer so that it may translocate to the nucleus. The signaling cascade that induces IκB degradation and thus leads to NFκB activation has recently been delineated (3Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). There is compelling evidence that phosphorylation of the regulatory serines on IκBα is mediated by a 300–500-kDa multisubunit IκB protein kinase (IKK) (4Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M.

Using two different phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitors, we have previously shown that the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway is also required for NFκB activation (11Reddy S.A.G. Huang J.H. Liao W.S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29167-29172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Whereas wortmannin efficiently blocked IL-1-induced increases in the DNA binding activity of NFκB, a dominant-negative mutant of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase inhibited the ability of IL-1 to induce an NFκB-dependent reporter gene (11Reddy S.A.G. Huang J.H. Liao W.S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29167-29172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). More recently, Marmiroli et al. (12Marmiroli S. Bavelloni A. Faenza I. Sirri A. Ognibene A. Cenni V. Tsukada J. Koyama Y. Ruzzene M. Ferri A. Auron P.E. Toker A. Maraldi N.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have shown that tyrosine 479 on the type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI) is required for receptor interaction with PI 3-kinase. When tyrosine 479 was replaced with phenylalanine, the mutant IL-1RI lost its ability to interact with PI 3-kinase and was deficient in signaling for the activation of both PI 3-kinase and NFκB. Our recent studies have shown that TNF-induced NFκB activation also requires PI 3-kinase and that, when inhibited, PI 3-kinase potentiates TNF-induced apoptosis (13Reddy S.A.G. Huang J.H. Liao W.S.-L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for PI 3-kinase in NFκB activation and the antiapoptotic properties of NFκB, p65/RelA protected cells from apoptosis induced by TNF in combination with wortmannin (13Reddy S.A.G. Huang J.H. Liao W.S.-L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Various other studies have shown the involvement of PI 3-kinase and/or its mediator Akt kinase in NFκB activation induced by IL-1, TNF, phorbol myristate acetate, platelet-derived growth factor, bradykinin, hypoxia, oncogenicras, and SV40 small t antigen (14Sizemore N.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) a role for it in IκB degradation and NFκB nuclear translocation. Evidence has been presented that, rather than being involved in DNA binding, PI 3-kinase and Akt are instead critical for the transcriptional activity of NFκB (p65/RelA) (14Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reasons for the discrepancies between the various studies are not clear, but they could be related to the inhibitors used and/or the molecular characteristics of the cell lines employed. Although these studies have implicated the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway in NFκB activation, much ambiguity about its role remains. Indeed, there is a need for approaches that would more clearly reveal the function of PI 3-kinase in NFκB activation. One approach would be to analyze mice with targeted deficiencies in the relevant individual molecules, and another would be to study somatic cell lines with lesions in the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway. In this study, we utilized a glioma cell line that lacks MMAC/PTEN, a natural antagonist of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, to investigate the function of PI 3-kinase in cytokine-induced NFκB activation. The lipid products of PI 3-kinase that are critical for the activation of downstream protein kinases such as Akt are specifically dephosphorylated at the 3′-OH position by the lipid phosphatase activity of MMAC/PTEN (22Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar, 23Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). This function of MMAC/PTEN, which appears to be responsible for its tumor suppressor properties, is important for regulating PI 3-kinase activity in vivo (24Wu X. Senechal K. Neshat M.S. Whang Y.E. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15587-15591Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar,25Myers M.P. Pas I. Batty I.H. Van Der Kaay J. Stolarov J.P. Hemmings B.A. Wigler M.H.

The use of MMAC/PTEN as a specific inhibitor could therefore be advantageous for studying the role of PI 3-kinase in NFκB activation. Our results indicate that PI 3-kinase is involved in the regulation of DNA binding activity and trans-activation potential of NFκB through a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism that is parallel to but distinct from the IκB degradation pathway. U251 human glioblastoma cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Antibodies were obtained from either Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA (MMAC/PTEN, p65/RelA, Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and IκBα antibodies), New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA (anti-phospho-Akt/protein kinase B serine 473), or Imgenex, San Diego, CA (anti-IKKα). LY294002 was obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA. pLNCX retroviral vector (CLONTECH) derived from Moloney murine leukemia virus was utilized for retroviral gene delivery and expression. A full-length MMAC/PTEN retroviral construct was generated by ligating a NotI-SalI fragment from pBluescript-MMAC/PTEN into the multiple cloning site of pLNCX. PT67 retrovirus producer cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1000 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine and transfected with the wild-type MMAC/PTEN construct by calcium phosphate precipitation. The human glioma cell line U251 was infected with 48-h supernatants from the transfected PT67 cells. After 14 h of incubation, infected cells were selected with 400 μg/ml G418. Drug-resistant colonies were expanded to generate clonal cell lines and screened for MMAC/PTEN expression by immunoblotting. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7 (sodium pyrophosphate), 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 3 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm Na3VO4(sodium orthovanadate), 1 μm pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mm iodoacetic acid, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin to prepare whole-cell lysates. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and then they were probed with various primary antibodies (MMAC/PTEN, IκB, IKK, and phospho-Akt). For the detection of p65/RelA, nuclear extracts were used instead of whole-cell lysates. Specific proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Parental U251 or MMAC/PTEN-expressing U251(MMAC) cells were treated with IL-1 (1 nm) or TNF (1 nm) for various periods of time. 2.5 μg of nuclear extracts that were prepared as described previously (11Reddy S.A.G. Huang J.H. Liao W.S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29167-29172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with radiolabeled NFκB-binding probe. For supershift assays, anti-p65/RelA antibody or IgG was added to the incubation mixtures for 5 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. Where indicated, IL-1-treated U251 nuclear extracts were incubated with 10 units/ml of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (homogeneity determined by silver staining, a gift of Dr. Zahi Damuni) for 10 min at 37 °C before incubation with the radiolabeled probe. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. U251 and U251(MMAC) cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates and transfected the following day with an (NFκB)4/luciferase reporter along with an IκBα expression plasmid or an empty vector control using the FuGeneTM reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, cells were treated with IL-1, lysed, and assayed with the enhanced luciferase assay kit (PharMingen). HEK 293 and Hep3B cells were treated in an identical manner except that the (NFκB)4/luciferase reporter was cotransfected with empty pCMV-Flag2 vector or with pCMV-Flag2-MMAC/PTEN. Whole-cell lysates were prepared as described earlier and incubated for 1 h with appropriate antibodies to immunoprecipitate either Akt or phospho-Akt (serine 473). Immune complexes were precipitated with a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads (Pierce), washed, and eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Eluted proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed by Western blotting analysis with anti-IKKα or anti-IκBα antibodies. Proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Whole-cell lysates prepared from IL-1-treated cells were incubated with anti-JNK antibodies. Immune complexes were washed extensively with lysis buffer and assayed for JNK activity with 2 μg of GST-c-Jun-(1–79) as substrate. Assay mixtures, which included 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP and 10 mm MgCl2, were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C, after which reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. Protein phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography. U251 or U251(MMAC) cells were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes and incubated overnight in serum- and phosphate-free medium. On the following day, cells were washed and radiolabeled for 3 h in [32P]orthophosphate-containing medium (0.1 mCi/ml). After treatment with IL-1 for 30 min, whole-cell lysates were prepared and clarified by centrifugation. To extract protein from any intact nuclei that remained in the insoluble fraction, we incubated the pellets with buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl (11Reddy S.A.G. Huang J.H. Liao W.S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29167-29172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and mixed this extract with whole-cell lysate. Equal amounts of protein from the mixture were used for the immunoprecipitation of NFκB with anti-p50 antibodies. After coupling to protein A-Sepharose beads, immune complexes were washed several times and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled protein bands were visualized by autoradiography. MMAC/PTEN is frequently mutated or deleted in a wide variety of human cancers (26Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L. McCombie R. Bigner S.H.

We examined various cell lines for MMAC/PTEN expression to identify those cells that might be suitable for studying the role of PI 3-kinase in NFκB activation. Among others, the U251 glioma cell line lacked MMAC/PTEN expression and was highly responsive to IL-1 and TNF stimulation. These cells were previously reported to have a mutated MMAC/PTEN gene (27Steck P.A. Pershouse M. Jasser S.A. Yung W.K.A. Lin H. Ligon A.H. Langford L.A. Baumgard M.L. Hattier T. Davis T. Frye C. Hu R. Swedlund B. Teng D.H.F. Tavtigian S.V. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). Both IL-1 and TNF were able to stimulate the activation of PI 3-kinase and NFκB very potently in U251 cells (data not shown) with kinetics that were similar to those induced by them in other cell lines (11Reddy S.A.G. Huang J.H. Liao W.S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29167-29172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 13Reddy S.A.G. Huang J.H. Liao W.S.-L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We proceeded to generate stable MMAC/PTEN-expressing clones by infecting parental U251 cells with supernatants from retrovirus producer cells transfected with wild-type MMAC/PTEN. Drug-resistant U251(MMAC), but not parental U251 cells, expressed MMAC/PTEN as confirmed by immunoblotting analysis (Fig.1). The lipid products of PI 3-kinase are known to target the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt to the plasma membrane, where it is fully activated through phosphorylation on serine 473 and threonine 308 (28Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar, 29Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev.

MMAC/PTEN dephosphorylates the lipid products of PI 3-kinase at the 3′-OH position and prevents the phosphorylation and activation of Akt (22Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar, 24Wu X. Senechal K. Neshat M.S. Whang Y.E. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15587-15591Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). We therefore examined U251 and U251(MMAC) cells to compare and contrast the phosphorylation status of Akt. The basal levels of phosphorylated Akt, which were clearly detectable in U251 cells, were significantly higher than those in the MMAC/PTEN-expressing cell line (Fig. 1). In addition, whereas serum- and IL-1-inducible levels of Akt phosphorylation were profound in U251 cells, they were barely detectable in the U251(MMAC) cells (Fig. 1). Because MMAC/PTEN did not affect the protein levels of Akt (Fig. 1), its effect on Akt phosphorylation is presumably attributable to its lipid phosphatase function in the PI 3-kinase pathway as demonstrated previously (for example, see Refs. 24Wu X. Senechal K. Neshat M.S. Whang Y.E. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15587-15591Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 31Li D.-M Sun H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5285-5290PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude that when MMAC/PTEN is reintroduced into U251 cells, it is able to block IL-1-induced phosphorylation and activation of Akt through the inhibition of PI 3-kinase-generated signals. Both PI 3-kinase and Akt have been shown to be required for the activation of NFκB (11Reddy S.A.G. Huang J.H. Liao W.S.-L. J. Biol.

Because IL-1- induced Akt phosphorylation was efficiently inhibited in U251(MMAC) cells, we investigated whether MMAC/PTEN expression would also affect NFκB activation. Both IL-1 and TNF strongly induced the DNA binding activity of NFκB (30–120 min) in parental U251 cells as determined by gel shift assays (Fig. 2). Cytokine-inducible DNA-protein complexes contained NFκB (p65/p50 heterodimer) because they could be supershifted with anti-p65/RelA antibodies but not by nonspecific IgG. The ability of IL-1 and TNF to activate NFκB was, however, inhibited in U251(MMAC) cells, suggesting that MMAC/PTEN had the potential to regulate the DNA binding activity of NFκB (Fig. 2). It is interesting to note that the cytokine-mediated induction of a second DNA-protein band, which was probably the p50/p50 homodimeric complex of NFκB, was also inhibited in U251(MMAC) cells (Fig.2). To confirm that MMAC/PTEN inhibits cytokine-induced NFκB activation, we examined its effects on the induction of an NFκB/luciferase reporter gene. The expression of this gene, which could be strongly induced (∼10-fold) in IL-1-treated U251 cells (Fig.3 A), required NFκB activation because it was inhibited in the presence of the IκB inhibitor. Consistent with the gel mobility shift assays (Fig.2 A), IL-1-induced expression of the NFκB/luciferase reporter gene was inhibited in U251(MMAC) cells (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, transient transfection of MMAC/PTEN into human embryonic kidney 293 and hepatoma Hep3B cells also sufficed to inhibit NFκB-dependent gene expression (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these results would strongly support a role for the PI 3-kinase pathway in the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of NFκB. Because expression of MMAC/PTEN in U251 cells blocked the activation of both Akt and NFκB (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3), we investigated whether it generally inhibited various other IL-1-induced signals as well. To evaluate this possibility, we examined the effects of MMAC/PTEN on the ability of IL-1 to stimulate the serine/threonine protein kinase JNK. JNK was immunoprecipitated from IL-1-treated U251 and U251(MMAC) cell extracts and assayed for activity with GST-Jun as the substrate (Fig. 4). The stimulation of JNK activity was observed within 15 min of treatment of U251 cells with IL-1 and persisted for about 2 h. Interestingly, the pattern of activation and the level of induction of JNK in these cells were similar to those observed in the U251(MMAC) cells (Fig. 4). It is therefore unlikely that MMAC/PTEN and, by inference, the PI 3-kinase pathway are involved in regulating JNK activation in IL-1 signaling. In a manner similar to IL-1, TNF was also able to stimulate JNK activity equally well in both U251 and U251(MMAC) cells (data not shown). Consistent with these results, two other PI 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and a dominant-negative mutant of PI 3-kinase (p85DN), did not affect cytokine-induced JNK activation either (data not shown). PI 3-kinase-independent pathways have previously been shown to be involved in the activation of JNK, such as in platelet-derived growth factor signal transduction (33Gu J. Tamura M. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). On analysis, these results would therefore strongly argue that the inhibitory effects of MMAC/PTEN on Akt and NFκB activation are relatively specific. The site-specific phosphorylation of IκBα induces its degradation and facilitates the nuclear translocation of the p65/p50 heterodimer. Because IL-1- and TNF-induced NFκB activation was inhibited in U251(MMAC) cells (Figs.2 and 3), we investigated whether this occurred because MMAC/PTEN interfered with either of these obligatory steps in NFκB activation. To our surprise immunoblotting analysis revealed that IL-1 induced the degradation of IκB efficiently and with nearly identical kinetics in both U251 and U251(MMAC) cells (Fig.5 A). Furthermore, NFκB (p65/RelA) was found to translocate normally to the nucleus after cytokine treatment with no apparent differences between parental and MMAC/PTEN-expressing cells (Fig. 5 B). Similar results were observed when the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 were employed (data not shown). These data would suggest that MMAC/PTEN does not regulate any of the steps that lead to IκB degradation and"

Here the 400 amino acid residues of this protein were individually replaced by cysteine except for the initial methionine. As a result, we could obtain a complete map of the functionally or structurally important residues. In addition, we could determine the precise boundaries of all the transmembrane segments on the basis of the reactivity withN-ethylmaleimide (NEM). The NEM binding results indicated the presence of a transmembrane water-filled channel in the transporter. The twelve transmembrane segments can be divided into three groups; four are totally embedded in the hydrophobic interior, four face a putative water-filled channel along their full length, and the remaining four face the channel for half their length, the other halves being embedded in the hydrophobic interior. These three types of transmembrane segments are mutually arranged with a 4-fold symmetry. The competitive binding of membrane-permeable and -impermeable SH reagents in intact cells indicates that the transmembrane water-filled channel has a thin barrier against hydrophilic molecules in the middle of the transmembrane region.

Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The NEM-reactive positions periodically appeared along the full-length of TM2, indicating that one side of this transmembrane helix faces a water-filled transmembrane channel. It is impossible that such a water-filled channel is composed of only one amphiphilic helix. Some counterparts should be present in the transmembrane region of TetA(B). Very recently, we analyzed cysteine-scanning mutants of TM1 and TM11 (21Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Konishi S. Tamura N. Kubo Y. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18692-18697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and TM4 and TM5 (22Iwaki S. Tamura N. Kimura-Someya T. Nada S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22704-22712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and found that TM5 and TM11 also face the channel along their full length, whereas only the periplasmic (C-terminal) and cytoplasmic (C-terminal) halves of TM1 and TM4 face the channel, respectively. Considering the amphiphilic nature of the metal-tetracycline chelation complex (1Yamaguchi A. Udagawa T. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4809-4813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the water-filled channel may be at least a part of a substrate translocation pathway.In this study, we constructed cysteine-scanning mutants as to the remaining four putative transmembrane segments, TM7, TM8, TM10, and TM12, and the central large loop region, loop6–7. Now, we have obtained a complete set of the 400 cysteine-scanning mutants of TetA(B), except for the mutant as to the initial methionine. In this manuscript, we report the results of NEM binding and competitive binding of NEM and a membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl reagent, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS), in comparison with the results for the other eight transmembrane helices. We first drew a complete map of the wall of the transmembrane water-filled channel and demonstrated the presence of a permeability barrier for hydrophilic molecules in the middle of the channel.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we accomplished the construction of a complete set of cysteine-scanning mutants of the tetracycline/H+antiporter. To our surprise, only a small number of the mutants (around 14%) showed reduced drug resistance. The majority of the mutants retained full level resistance. This is very advantageous for topology determination by means of the site-directed chemical labeling method. Fig. 7 shows a summary of the detailed topology of TetA(B) determined on the basis of the results of this study and our previous studies (6Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol.

Each transmembrane segment comprises a number of amino acid residues between 24 (TM11) and 15 (TM8); however, it should be noted that this method tends to underestimate the numbers of amino acid residues in “hydrophilic” or “amphiphilic” transmembrane segments. Highly hydrophilic segments such as TM5 and TM8 are followed by entirely hydrophobic segments, TM6 and TM9, respectively, indicating that the membrane insertion of these hydrophilic segments may be promoted by insertion of the following hydrophobic segments during topogenesis. The topology shown in Fig. 7 clearly reveals the presence of a striking 4-fold symmetry in TetA(B). That is, the totally embedded segments, TM3, TM6, TM9, and TM12, are separated by two other segments, respectively. The “totally amphiphilic” segments, TM2, TM5, TM8, and TM11, and the “partly amphiphilic” segments, TM1, TM4, TM7, and TM10, are also separated by two other segments, respectively. All of the partly amphiphilic segments exhibit an amphiphilic nature in their C-terminal halves, whereas their N-terminal halves are entirely hydrophobic. The amphiphilic parts of the odd and even numbered partly amphiphilic segments are at the periplasmic and cytoplasmic ends, respectively. We previously reported that the periplasmic ends of TM1 and TM2 are close to that of TM11 (30Kawabe T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 31Kubo Y.

Fig. 8 shows a hypothetical model of the helix arrangement of TetA(B) based on our previous and current results. There is a water-filled channel at the center of the molecule. The four amphiphilic helices, TM2, TM5, TM8 and TM11, comprise the wall of the channel. The partly amphiphilic helices, TM1, TM4, TM7, and TM10, are tilted away from the channel, with only their cytoplasmic or periplasmic halves facing it. The four “hydrophobic” helices, TM3, TM6, TM9, and TM12, are probably located at the periphery of the helix bundle. This model is fundamentally similar to the model for lactose permease presented by Goswitz and Brooker (32Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recently, Yin et al. (33Yin C.C. Aldema-Ramos M.L. Borges-Walmsley M.I. Taylor R.W. Walmsley A.R. Levy S.B. Bullough P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) reported that the low resolution two-dimensional image of TetA(B) was reported by electron microscopic analysis, which also could be superimposed with the ring-like structure such as that of lactose permease.Figure 8Model of the helix arrangement of TetA(B).

All wall-forming helices are involved in the barrier, which means that there is no uncoupling bypass in the water-filled channel. The barrier is located in the middle of the transmembrane segment a little to the periplasmic end, except for that of TM1. In TM1, the barrier is very close to the periplasmic end. There are two possibilities,i.e. 1) the TM1 helix may extend toward loop1–2 and form a funnel-like exit of the channel, or 2) the TetA(B) molecule is dented on the periplasmic surface at TM1.The effects of tetracycline on the NEM binding are indicated by downward (inhibitory) and upward (stimulatory) arrows in Fig. 7. Previously (6Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we supposed that tetracycline may cause the TetA(B) conformational change from the inside-closed/outside-open form to the inside-open/outside-closed form, because the NEM binding to the S65C (inside) and L97C (outside) mutants was inhibited and stimulated by tetracycline (6Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, on the basis of our current results, the substrate-induced conformational change may be complicated. To our surprise, there was no region in which NEM binding to Cys mutants was continuously inhibited or stimulated by tetracycline, indicating that the substrate-induced occlusion or exposure of any domain(s) of TetA(B) did not occur. It should be noted that the mutations exhibiting inhibitory effects of tetracycline are mainly located around the permeability barrier in the N-terminal half, suggesting the presence of the substrate binding site.Fig. 7 also shows the distribution of the functionally and/or structurally important residues of which cysteine mutants exhibit reduced drug resistance. Among them, the number of essential residues, the MIC of cysteine mutants of which were less than 10 μg/ml, is only 17 (4%), and that of moderately important residues (MIC < 50 μg/ml) is 41 (10%). In total, 58 (14%) of the 401 amino acid residues of TetA(B) contribute to the structure and/or function. The remaining 343 residues (86%) are apparently related to neither the structure nor the function. Of the 17 essential residues, 13 are located in the transmembrane region. In addition, of these 13 essential residues, eight are glycines, and two are prolines, confirming the importance of glycines and prolines in the transmembrane regions of transporter molecules. The other essential residues in the transmembrane regions number only three, Arg101, Asp285, and Tyr357. Essential residues are concentrated in TM4, TM5, TM8, and TM11. Among the loop regions, only three loops, loop2–3, loop4–5, and loop10–11 include essential residues, all of which are cytoplasmic. However, it should not be forgotten that the residues of which cysteine mutants exhibit moderately reduced resistance also play significant roles in the transport process, such as Asp84 (34Yamaguchi A. Akasaka T. Ono N. Someya Y. Nakatani M. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7490-7498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Arg70(35Someya Y. Kimura-Someya T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol.

Kaback's laboratory (37Frillingos S. Sahin-Tóth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and vigorously analyzed. Although lactose permease is substrate/H+ symporter, the analysis of the complete cysteine-scanning mutants of tetracycline/H+ antiporter revealed interesting similarity to lactose permease, i.e.the small numbers of essential residues, periodical distribution of NEM-reactive positions in the transmembrane segments, and the circular arrangement of transmembrane helices whereas the order of each helix seems different in each other, indicating that the molecular constructions of symporters and antiporters belonging to the major facilitator superfamily are fundamentally common. Anyway, the comparative analysis of the complete sets of cysteine-scanning mutants of tetracycline/H+ antiporter and lactose permease will be very useful for clearing the molecular structures and the transport mechanism of secondary transporters. The transposon Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H+antiporter (TetA(B))1 (1Yamaguchi A. Udagawa T. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4809-4813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was the first found bacterial drug exporter (2McMurry L. Petrucci Jr., R.E. Levy S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3974-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and has been studied as a paradigm of bacterial drug efflux proteins. It belongs to a major facilitator superfamily (3Henderson P.J.F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and its 12-membrane-spanning structure (Fig. 1) was established by site-directed competitive chemical modification of cysteine mutants of a cysteine-free TetA(B) (5Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We previously reported that putative transmembrane helices (TM) 3 (6Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), 6 (7Konishi S. Iwaki S. Kimura-Someya T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and 9 (8Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) are totally embedded in a highly hydrophobic environment, because none of the cysteine-scanning mutants as to these transmembrane helices reacted with a maleimide derivative,N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), whereas cysteine mutants as to putative loop regions are generally highly reactive with NEM, except for those as to a small number of non-reactive positions (9Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19155-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar transmembrane segments totally embedded in a hydrophobic interior are known for the erythrocyte anion exchanger (10Tang X.-O. Fujinaga J. Kopito R. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22545-22553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and for the bacterial small multidrug efflux protein EmrE (11Mordoch S.S. Granot D. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19480-19486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). On the other hand, some transmembrane cysteine mutants of major facilitator superfamily transporters such as lactose permease (12Sahin-Toth M. Kaback H.R.

A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) are certainly inactivated by SH reagents, indicating that in these transporters SH reagents can possibly gain access to some of the residues located in the interior of the transmembrane region. Afterward, we found that some cysteine-scanning mutants as to TM2 of TetA(B) are reactive with NEM (20Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The NEM-reactive positions periodically appeared along the full-length of TM2, indicating that one side of this transmembrane helix faces a water-filled transmembrane channel. It is impossible that such a water-filled channel is composed of only one amphiphilic helix. Some counterparts should be present in the transmembrane region of TetA(B). Very recently, we analyzed cysteine-scanning mutants of TM1 and TM11 (21Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Konishi S. Tamura N. Kubo Y. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18692-18697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and TM4 and TM5 (22Iwaki S. Tamura N. Kimura-Someya T. Nada S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22704-22712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and found that TM5 and TM11 also face the channel along their full length, whereas only the periplasmic (C-terminal) and cytoplasmic (C-terminal) halves of TM1 and TM4 face the channel, respectively. Considering the amphiphilic nature of the metal-tetracycline chelation complex (1Yamaguchi A. Udagawa T. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4809-4813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the water-filled channel may be at least a part of a substrate translocation pathway. In this study, we constructed cysteine-scanning mutants as to the remaining four putative transmembrane segments, TM7, TM8, TM10, and TM12, and the central large loop region, loop6–7. Now, we have obtained a complete set of the 400 cysteine-scanning mutants of TetA(B), except for the mutant as to the initial methionine. In this manuscript, we report the results of NEM binding and competitive binding of NEM and a membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl reagent, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS), in comparison with the results for the other eight transmembrane helices. We first drew a complete map of the wall of the transmembrane water-filled channel and demonstrated the presence of a permeability barrier for hydrophilic molecules in the middle of the channel. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we accomplished the construction of a complete set of cysteine-scanning mutants of the tetracycline/H+antiporter. To our surprise, only a small number of the mutants (around 14%) showed reduced drug resistance. The majority of the mutants retained full level resistance. This is very advantageous for topology determination by means of the site-directed chemical labeling method. Fig. 7 shows a summary of the detailed topology of TetA(B) determined on the basis of the results of this study and our previous studies (6Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,7Konishi S. Iwaki S. Kimura-Someya T. Yamaguchi A.

Each transmembrane segment comprises a number of amino acid residues between 24 (TM11) and 15 (TM8); however, it should be noted that this method tends to underestimate the numbers of amino acid residues in “hydrophilic” or “amphiphilic” transmembrane segments. Highly hydrophilic segments such as TM5 and TM8 are followed by entirely hydrophobic segments, TM6 and TM9, respectively, indicating that the membrane insertion of these hydrophilic segments may be promoted by insertion of the following hydrophobic segments during topogenesis. The topology shown in Fig. 7 clearly reveals the presence of a striking 4-fold symmetry in TetA(B). That is, the totally embedded segments, TM3, TM6, TM9, and TM12, are separated by two other segments, respectively. The “totally amphiphilic” segments, TM2, TM5, TM8, and TM11, and the “partly amphiphilic” segments, TM1, TM4, TM7, and TM10, are also separated by two other segments, respectively. All of the partly amphiphilic segments exhibit an amphiphilic nature in their C-terminal halves, whereas their N-terminal halves are entirely hydrophobic. The amphiphilic parts of the odd and even numbered partly amphiphilic segments are at the periplasmic and cytoplasmic ends, respectively. We previously reported that the periplasmic ends of TM1 and TM2 are close to that of TM11 (30Kawabe T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 31Kubo Y.

Fig. 8 shows a hypothetical model of the helix arrangement of TetA(B) based on our previous and current results. There is a water-filled channel at the center of the molecule.

In total, 58 (14%) of the 401 amino acid residues of TetA(B) contribute to the structure and/or function. The remaining 343 residues (86%) are apparently related to neither the structure nor the function. Of the 17 essential residues, 13 are located in the transmembrane region. In addition, of these 13 essential residues, eight are glycines, and two are prolines, confirming the importance of glycines and prolines in the transmembrane regions of transporter molecules. The other essential residues in the transmembrane regions number only three, Arg101, Asp285, and Tyr357. Essential residues are concentrated in TM4, TM5, TM8, and TM11. Among the loop regions, only three loops, loop2–3, loop4–5, and loop10–11 include essential residues, all of which are cytoplasmic. However, it should not be forgotten that the residues of which cysteine mutants exhibit moderately reduced resistance also play significant roles in the transport process, such as Asp84 (34Yamaguchi A. Akasaka T. Ono N. Someya Y. Nakatani M. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7490-7498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Arg70(35Someya Y. Kimura-Someya T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol.

Kaback's laboratory (37Frillingos S. Sahin-Tóth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and vigorously analyzed. Although lactose permease is substrate/H+ symporter, the analysis of the complete cysteine-scanning mutants of tetracycline/H+ antiporter revealed interesting similarity to lactose permease, i.e.the small numbers of essential residues, periodical distribution of NEM-reactive positions in the transmembrane segments, and the circular arrangement of transmembrane helices whereas the order of each helix seems different in each other, indicating that the molecular constructions of symporters and antiporters belonging to the major facilitator superfamily are fundamentally common. Anyway, the comparative analysis of the complete sets of cysteine-scanning mutants of tetracycline/H+ antiporter and lactose permease will be very useful for clearing the molecular structures and the transport mechanism of secondary transporters."

We have identified, at least in part, the mechanism by which polyunsaturated fatty acids increase UCP-2 expression in primary culture of human muscle cells. ω-6 fatty acids and arachidonic acid induced a 3-fold rise in UCP-2 mRNA levels possibly through transcriptional activation. This effect was prevented by indomethacin and mimicked by prostaglandin (PG) E2 and carbaprostacyclin PGI2, consistent with a cyclooxygenase-mediated process. Incubation of myotubes for 6 h with 100 μm arachidonic acid resulted in a 150-fold increase in PGE2 and a 15-fold increase in PGI2in the culture medium. Consistent with a role of cAMP and protein kinase A, both prostaglandins induced a marked accumulation of cAMP in human myotubes, and forskolin reproduced the effect of arachidonic acid on UCP-2 mRNA expression. Inhibition of protein kinase A with H-89 suppressed the effect of PGE2, whereas cPGI2and arachidonic acid were still able to increaseucp-2 gene expression, suggesting additional mechanisms. We found, however, that the MAP kinase pathway was not involved. Prostaglandins, particularly PGI2, are potent activators of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. A specific agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) β (L165041) increased UCP-2 mRNA levels in myotubes, whereas activation of PPARα or PPARγ was ineffective. These results suggest thus that ucp-2 gene expression is regulated by ω-6 fatty acids in human muscle cells through mechanisms involving at least protein kinase A and the nuclear receptor PPARβ.

UCP-1 mediates the dissipation of the mitochondrial proton gradient generated by the respiratory chain resulting in the production of heat instead of ATP (7Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol.

Because there is little brown fat in adult, UCP-1 activity may not contribute to a large extent to energy expenditure in humans. UCP-2 mRNA is present in many tissues including adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (1Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwit R.S.

Tartaglia L.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 900-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), whereas UCP-3 mRNA is preferentially expressed in skeletal muscle (3Boss O. Samec S. Paoloni-Giacobino A.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have demonstrated that UCP-2 and UCP-3, like UCP-1, are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and have uncoupling activity (5Boss O. Hagen T. Lowell B.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 6Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Therefore, they are candidates to explain the mitochondrial proton leak in tissues devoid of UCP-1. To date, the proposed functions for UCP-2 and UCP-3 include the control of different components of energy expenditure, the control of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production generated by the mitochondrial electron transport chain, the regulation of ATP synthesis, and the regulation of fatty acid oxidation (5Boss O. Hagen T. Lowell B.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 6Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence implicate fatty acids in the regulation ofucp-2 and ucp-3 gene expression. For example, high fat diet for 2 weeks produces a marked increase in UCP-2 mRNA expression in white adipose tissue in mice (9Surwit R.S. Wang S. Petro A.E. Sanchis D. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Collins S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 195: 4061-4065Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The induction ofucp-3 gene expression in mouse muscle just after birth correlates with the increase in plasma levels of NEFAs due to the initiation of suckling (10Brun S. Carmona M.C. Mampel T. Vinas O. Giralt M. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In rats, an increase in plasma NEFA level induced by intralipid plus heparin infusion causes a rise in skeletal muscle UCP-3 mRNA level (11Weigle D.S. Selfridge L.E. Schwartz M.W. Seeley R.J. Cummings D.E. Havel P.J. Kuijper J.L. BeltrandelRio H. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 298-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In humans also, data support a role for fatty acids in the regulation of ucp-2 anducp-3 gene expression in vivo. A positive correlation was reported between plasma NEFA levels and total UCP-3 mRNA levels in skeletal muscle of obese subjects (12Boss O. Bobbioni-Harsch E. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Muzzin P. Munger R. Giacobino J.-P. Golay A. Lancet. 1998; 351: 1933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that UCP-2 and UCP-3 mRNA expression is up-regulated during severe calorie restriction (13Millet L. Vidal H. Andreelli F. Larrouy D. Riou J.P. Ricquier D. Laville M. Langin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2665-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 14Millet L. Vidal H. Larrouy D. Andreelli F. Laville M. Langin D. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), a condition associated with increased adipose tissue lipolysis and plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations. In addition, we have observed positive relationships between variations in plasma NEFA levels during calorie restriction and changes in UCP-3 mRNA abundance in the muscle of obese nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic patients (15Vidal H. Langin D. Andreelli F. Millet L. Larrouy D. Laville M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E830-E837PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we have demonstrated that the rise in NEFA plasma levels and in lipid oxidation during triglyceride infusion is associated with increased expression of UCP-3 in skeletal muscle of healthy lean subjects (16Khalfallah Y. Fages S. Laville M. Langin D. Vidal H. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Little data are available regarding the nature of the fatty acids involved in the regulation of UCP genes expression in muscle and in adipose tissue, and thus their mechanisms of action are not yet clearly defined. So far, in vitro studies have mainly tested the role of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) because these nuclear receptors have been proposed to mediate the transcriptional effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) or their derivatives on a number of lipid-related genes (17Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 18Wahli W. Devchand P.R. Ijpenberg A. Desvergne B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 447: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In white adipocytes, PPARβ seems to be involved in the regulation ofucp-2 gene expression in undifferentiated cells (19Aubert J. Champigny O. Saint-Marc P. Negrel R. Collins S. Ricquier D. Ailhaud G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), whereas PPARγ is likely to play a major role in differentiated adipocytes (19 -21). In muscle, depending upon the cell line used, the data are less clear. Oleic acid was found to induce ucp-3gene expression in several models (22Hwang C.S. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Nagase I. Yoshida S. Canas X. Irie Y. Kimura K. Yoshida T. Saito M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This effect can be reproduced by a specific agonist of PPARγ in mouse C2C12 cells (22Hwang C.S. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In rat L6 myotubes, however, PPARγ activation does not modifyucp-3 gene expression, and PPARβ was postulated to play a role in this process (23Nagase I. Yoshida S. Canas X. Irie Y. Kimura K. Yoshida T. Saito M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in the L6 cell model, UCP-2 expression was reported to be induced by thiazolidine diones and PPARγ activation (21Camirand A. Marie V. Rabelo R. Silva J.E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 428-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Finally, in cardiomyocytes, activation of PPARα, and not of PPARγ, promoted a strong induction of UCP-2 expression (24Van Der Lee K.A. Willemsen P.H. Van Der Vusse G.J. Van Bilsen M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Additional pathways, distinct from PPAR activation, participate in the regulation of gene expression by fatty acids (25Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 63-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Fatty acids or their derivatives (acyl-coenzyme A, oxidized fatty acids) may directly bind to and modify the transcriptional activity of other transcription factors (25Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 63-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In addition, eicosanoids can bind cell surface receptors that are linked to G proteins and then activate several signaling cascades (MAP kinase, protein kinase A, protein kinase C) (25Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 63-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The concomitant participation of multiple pathways in the transcriptional action of fatty acids has been recently illustrated in a study of the regulation of Glut 4 gene expression by arachidonic acid (26Long S.D. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1138-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present work we attempted to identify the nature and the mechanism of action of the fatty acids that may be involved in the previously observed induction of UCP expression in human skeletal muscle in vivo (14Millet L. Vidal H. Larrouy D. Andreelli F. Laville M. Langin D. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Vidal H. Langin D. Andreelli F. Millet L. Larrouy D. Laville M. Am.

To this end, we used a model of human differentiated myotubes in primary culture (27Roques M. Vidal H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34005-34010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We found that ω-6 PUFAs, but not the ω-3, up-regulate ucp-2 gene expression in human muscle cells through the production of prostaglandins and multiple intracellular pathways including protein kinase A-dependent activation and involvement of the nuclear receptor PPARβ. Culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc., or from Biomedia (Boussens, France). Fetal calf serum was purchased from Biomedia. All fatty acids and prostaglandins were obtained from Sigma and Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Indomethacin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), and forskolin were purchased from Sigma. H-89 (protein kinase A inhibitor) and PD-98059 (MAP kinase inhibitor) were from Calbiochem. Wy-14643 was obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories. Rosiglitazone was kindly provided by SmithKline Beecham (Harlow, UK). L-165041 was a gift from Drs. J. Berger and D. Moller from Merck. Biopsies of the lumbar mass (erector spinae) muscle (about 1 g) were taken, with the consent of the patient, during surgical procedure. The Ethics Committee of Lyon Hospitals approved the experimental protocol. In the present study, biopsies were taken from healthy lean subjects (49 ± 5 years) with no familial or personal history of diabetes, dyslipidemia, or hypertension. The satellite cells were isolated from the muscle biopsy by trypsin digestion and were grown in Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 1% chicken embryo extract, and 1% antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) as described previously in detail (27Roques M. Vidal H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34005-34010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Confluent myoblast were allowed to differentiate into myotubes in α-minimal essential medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and 1% antibiotics. Twelve to 16 days after induction of the differentiation process, most of the cells showed a multinuclear status that characterized mature myotubes (27Roques M. Vidal H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34005-34010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, the differentiated cells expressed muscle-specific markers (myosin, sarcomeric α-actin, and creatine kinase), and they were characterized by an insulin-sensitive glucose transport (27Roques M. Vidal H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34005-34010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The human myotubes were serum-starved overnight before incubations with fatty acids or other products. Stock solutions (50 mm) of fatty acid were prepared in absolute ethanol (EtOH) and stored at −20 °C in glass tubes, away from light. To obtain the desired concentrations, small amounts of stock solution were added, while stirring gently, to pre-warmed (37 °C) α-minimal essential medium containing 1% antibiotics and 1% free fatty acid bovine serum albumin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Dilutions were held at 37 °C for at least 1 h before addition to the cells. The molar ratio of fatty acid to albumin was 0.8, and the final concentration of EtOH was always kept below 0.2%. Solutions of prostaglandins, indomethacin, and NDGA were prepared in EtOH and kept at −20 °C under the same conditions as for the fatty acids. Proper amounts were directly added to the cell medium. Concentrated (10−2m) stock solutions of the different PPAR agonists, PD-98059 and forskolin, were done in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and stored at −20 °C away from the light. The final concentration was made by dilution with culture media. The final concentration of Me2SO was always kept less than 0.1%. All experiments with differentiated myotubes were done in 6-well culture plates, and incubations with vehicle (EtOH or Me2SO) alone were systematically performed as controls. At the end of the incubation periods, cells were scraped in the presence of 350 μl of the lysis buffer from the RNeasy kit for total RNA preparation (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Total RNA was purified following the instructions of the manufacturer, resuspended in 40 μl of RNase-free water, and stored at −80 °C until quantification of mRNAs. Concentration and purity of each sample were assessed by absorbance measurement at 260 nm and by the 260:280 nm ratio, respectively. The yield of total RNA averaged 1.3 μg/well from a 6-well culture plate, corresponding to ∼250,000 myoblasts per well at confluence, before induction of the differentiation process. The mRNA levels UCP-2, UCP-3, and the different isoforms of PPARs were determined using the RT-competitive PCR (RT-cPCR) assays that were described previously and validated (14Millet L. Vidal H. Larrouy D. Andreelli F. Laville M. Langin D. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Auboeuf D. Rieusset J. Fajas L. Vallier P. Frering V. Riou J.-P. Staels B. Auwerx J. Laville M. Vidal H. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The RT reactions were performed with 0.2 μg of total RNA in the presence of a specific antisense primer and a thermostable reverse transcriptase enzyme to warrant optimal synthesis of first strand cDNA (29Auboeuf D. Vidal H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cy-5 5′-end-labeled sense primers were used during the cPCR to generate fluorescent PCR products that were analyzed using an automated laser fluorescence DNA sequencer (ALFexpress, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 4% denaturating polyacrylamide gels. The sequences of the primers were identical to those reported previously (14Millet L. Vidal H. Larrouy D. Andreelli F. Laville M. Langin D. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Auboeuf D. Rieusset J. Fajas L. Vallier P. Frering V. Riou J.-P. Staels B. Auwerx J. Laville M. Vidal H. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The initial concentration of the target mRNA was determined at the competition equivalence point, as described in detail (29Auboeuf D. Vidal H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Myotubes were incubated with 100 μm arachidonic acid under the conditions described above. Incubation medium (3 ml) was collected from the well and filtrated to remove cells and cellular debris using 0.45-μm Minisart filter units (Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany). The clarified medium was kept at 4 °C in the presence of 40 μl of butylated hydroxytoluene as antioxidant. Extraction of the lipid fraction was performed with chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) (4.5 ml at pH 3). After centrifugation, the organic phase was removed and dried under nitrogen. Prostaglandins E2, F2α, and PGI2 (measured as its stable metabolite 6-oxo-PGF1α) concentrations were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using the protocol described by Tsikas (30Tsikas D. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Appl. 1998; 717: 201-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids in the dried organic phase were first derivatized in 100 μl of 10% pentafluorobenzyl bromide and 30 μl of 10% ethyldiisopropylamine (both in acetonitrile) for 30 min at 40 °C. The medium was then dried under nitrogen. Next, the oxo groups of the prostaglandins were methoximated with methoxamine hydrochloride (30 μl) in pyridine (30 μl) for 60 min at 60 °C. After drying under nitrogen, the hydroxy groups were esterified in 100 μl of pureN,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide for 30 min at 60 °C. Analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5973 gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (Les Ulis, France) in negative ions chemical ionization using CH4 as reagent gas. The production of cAMP was estimated according to the procedure described by Kasagiet al. (31Kasagi K. Konishi J. Iida Y. Ikekubo K. Mori T. Kuma K. Torizuka K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1982; 54: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), by measuring the amount of cAMP released from the cultured myotubes into 1.5 ml of medium (Hanks' solution without NaCl supplemented with 220 mm sucrose and 1 mmof 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine). Cyclic AMP was directly quantified in 5 μl of medium using the Biotrack cAMP 125I assay system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. After incubation, differentiated myotubes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer and then lysed in 350 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20mm NaH2PO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 20 mm 1% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 200 mm NaF and 4 mm NaVO4. After 1 h on ice, cells were scraped and the lysates were cleared of nuclei and detergent-insoluble materials by centrifugation (14,000 rpm) for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins (35 μg) were resolved by electrophoresis through 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membrane. Phosphorylated MAP kinase (ERK-1 and ERK-2) were detected using a human anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) as described by Sarbassov et al. (32Sarbassov D.D. Jones L.G. Peterson C.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 2038-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated MAP kinases were visualized using the Enzyme-catalyzed Fluorescence Substrate for Western blotting from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and quantified using a FluorImager SI and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). UCP-2 and UCP-3 mRNA levels was determined by RT-competitive PCR in human skeletal muscle cells after an overnight incubation in the absence of serum in the culture medium. Fig.1 shows the comparison of the results obtained in myotubes with UCP-2 and UCP-3 mRNA levels measured in human skeletal muscle biopsies. UCP-2 mRNA concentration was approximately two times lower in cultured cells than in muscle biopsies. However, the expression level was readily measurable, and the values were within the lower range of the individual data in muscle biopsies (ranging from 1.6 to 7 amol/μg total RNA) (14Millet L. Vidal H. Larrouy D. Andreelli F. Laville M. Langin D. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, UCP-3 mRNA levels were dramatically reduced in cultured myotubes when compared with muscle biopsies (0.05 ± 0.08 versus12 ± 2 amol/μg total RNA). The measured values were close to the detection limit of the RT-cPCR methodology when using 0.2 μg of total RNA in the reverse transcription reaction (29Auboeuf D. Vidal H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Extremely low level of expression of UCP-3 is a classical feature of skeletal muscle cells in culture. Hwang and Lane (22Hwang C.S. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have indicated that detection of UCP-3 mRNA in mice C2C12 cells required the use of 5 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA. Under such conditions, they have obtained a signal, using Northern blot, which was about 104less important than the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signal (22Hwang C.S. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the same study, in contrast, UCP-3 mRNA was readily measurable using total RNA preparations from mice skeletal muscle (22Hwang C.S. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The reasons for the down-regulation of ucp-3 gene expression in cultured muscle cells are unclear but may be related to the lack of signals arising from the innervation. A recent report demonstrates indeed that muscle denervation in mice led to a marked decrease in UCP-3 mRNA levels in gastrocnemius muscle (33Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Tsunoda N. Maruyama K. Takahashi M. Kim H. Ikemoto S. Ezaki O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To study the effects of fatty acids on UCP expression, 100 μm of C-18 and C-20 fatty acids that were representative of the different families (saturated, ω-3, ω-6 and ω-9), were added for 24 h to human myotubes, and the changes in UCP-2 and UCP-3 mRNA levels were monitored by RT-cPCR. Regarding UCP-3, oleic acid (C18:1, ω-9) produced an ∼3-fold increase in UCP-3 mRNA levels (data not shown). This result is in agreement with preceding reports (22Hwang C.S. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Nagase I. Yoshida S. Canas X. Irie Y. Kimura K. Yoshida T. Saito M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the amplitude of the effect showed large variations (0.2–18-fold increase, n = 6). This was probably due to the difficulty to measure accurately the low levels of UCP-3 mRNA by RT-cPCR. Therefore, we decided not to investigate the regulation of UCP-3 in this cell model in more detail, and we focused our attention on the effects of fatty acids on ucp-2 gene expression. Because a number of data show coordinate variations in UCP-2 and UCP-3 mRNA levels during metabolic changes in rodents and in humans (6Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 14Millet L. Vidal H. Larrouy D. Andreelli F. Laville M. Langin D. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), it could be hypothesized that similar mechanisms are involved in the regulation of both genes by fatty acids. Fig. 2 shows the effects of various fatty acids on UCP-2 mRNA expression. Stearic acid (C18:0) reduced UCP-2 mRNA levels. In contrast, UCP-2 mRNA levels were significantly increased by γ-linolenic acid (C18:3, ω-6), di-homo-γ-linolenic acid (C20:3, ω-6), and arachidonic acid (C20:4, ω-6). In rat L6 muscle cells, an induction of UCP-2 mRNA expression by linoleic acid (C18:2, ω-6) has been observed previously (21Camirand A. Marie V. Rabelo R. Silva J.E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 428-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, incubation of human primary muscle cells with linoleic acid did not affect UCP-2 expression. However, all the ω-6 PUFAs that are directly derived from linoleic acid induced a robust induction of UCP-2 mRNA (Fig. 2). This suggests that either longer incubations with linoleic acid are required to allow its metabolism or that enzymes metabolizing linoleic acid are lacking in the human myotube model. In contrast to the ω-6 PUFAs, fatty acids of the ω-3 series, as well as oleic acid (C18:1, ω-9), did not modify the expression of UCP-2 in human muscle cells in culture. Therefore, these results suggest that the up-regulation of UCP-2 mRNA expression by fatty acids is mainly dependent on the PUFAs from the ω-6 series. This effect was dependent on the concentration of fatty acid added into the culture medium. The half-maximal effect of γ-linolenic acid or arachidonic acid was observed with concentrations between 1 and 5 μm (data not shown). To verify whether the induction of UCP-2 mRNA reflected a transcriptional activation of theucp-2 gene or a post-transcriptional stabilization of the mRNA, myotubes were preincubated for 24 h with or without 100 μm arachidonic acid before addition of 10−6m actinomycin D, a potent inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. The kinetics of the decrease in UCP-2 mRNA concentration were similar under the two conditions (data not shown). The results from three independent preparations of human myotubes demonstrated that arachidonic acid does not sign"

Rapamycin also attenuates liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, but it is not known if this growth-suppressive effect is due to dephosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and/or 4E-BP1. We found that partial hepatectomy induced a transient increase in liver p70 S6 kinase activity and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation as compared with sham-operated rats. The amount of p70 S6 kinase protein in regenerating liver did not increase, but active kinase from partially hepatectomized animals was highly phosphorylated. Phosphorylated 4E-BP1 from regenerating liver was unable to form an inhibitory complex with initiation factor 4E. Rapamycin blocked the activation of p70 S6 kinase in response to partial hepatectomy in a dose-dependent manner, but 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was not inhibited. By contrast, functional phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 induced by injection of cycloheximide or growth factors was partially reversed by the drug. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been proposed to directly phosphorylate 4E-BP1. Western blot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies showed that phosphorylation of Thr-36/45 and Ser-64 increased in response to partial hepatectomy in a rapamycin-resistant manner. Thus, rapamycin inhibits p70 S6 kinase activation and liver regeneration, but not functional phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, in response to partial hepatectomy. These results indicate that the effect of rapamycin on 4E-BP1 function in vivo can be significantly different from its effect in cultured cells.

A commonly used method for inducing liver regeneration in the rat is by performing a partial hepatectomy in which the two main lobes of the liver are excised, resulting in 68% tissue loss (1Higgins G.M. Anderson R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar). After partial hepatectomy, the remaining liver cells rapidly undergo one or two proliferative cycles so that the mass of the liver remnant nearly doubles after 2 days and approaches the original liver weight by 7 days. The kinetics of this proliferative response have been well documented (reviewed in Ref. 2Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2906) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis in parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) begins about 12 h after partial hepatectomy and reaches a peak by 20–24 h, followed by a gradual decline. Mitosis follows 6–8 h later. Nonparenchymal cells lag 24 h behind hepatocytes in initiating DNA synthesis and mitosis. DNA synthesis and restoration of the cell deficit in the liver remnant are mostly complete by 72 h. Partial hepatectomy also leads to an increase in hepatic protein synthesis that is essential for regeneration (3Gottlieb L.I. Fausto N. Van Lancker J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 555-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Tsukada K. Moriyama T. Umeda T. Lieberman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1160-1165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Superimposed on a general increase in the rate of protein synthesis are marked increases in translation of specific mRNAs (5Aloni R. Peleg D. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2203-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Experiments using a variety of model systems have shown that increased translation of these growth-regulated mRNAs is exerted mainly at the level of initiation. In translation initiation, the 43 S preinitiation complex binds to the m7GpppN (where N is any nucleotide) cap on the 5′ end of the mRNA, the complex translocates to the initiation codon, and then the 60 S ribosomal subunit is added to form an active 80 S ribosome (reviewed in Refs. 6Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar and 7Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In general, binding of the 43 S preinitiation complex to mRNA is the rate-limiting step in translation initiation. This step is mediated by eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)1 4F. One subunit of the eIF4F complex, eIF4E, binds directly to the m7GpppN cap on the mRNA, and a second subunit, eIF4G, interacts with the 43 S preinitiation complex. Activation of translation initiation results in increased loading of ribosomes onto growth-regulated mRNAs. After partial hepatectomy, a variety of growth factors and hormones carried in the bloodstream activate signaling pathways that stimulate proliferation of the remaining liver cells (reviewed in Refs. 2Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2906) Google Scholar and 8Strain A. Diehl A.M. Liver Growth and Regeneration. Chapman & Hall, London1998Crossref Google Scholar). Experiments done mainly in cultured cells have shown that some of these signaling pathways activate protein synthesis by inducing the phosphorylation of various components of the translational machinery (6Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 7Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 9Jefferies H.B.J.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). For example, many growth factors promote the phosphorylation of the S6 protein in 40 S ribosomal subunits (9Jefferies H.B.J. Thomas G. Hershey J. Mathews M. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 389-409Google Scholar). The major kinase that phosphorylates S6 is the Mr = 70,000 S6 kinase (p70 S6 kinase) (9Jefferies H.B.J. Thomas G. Hershey J. Mathews M. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 389-409Google Scholar, 11Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p70 S6 kinase is activated by phosphorylation of the enzyme at multiple serine and threonine residues (12Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 13Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the 40 S ribosomal subunit by p70 S6 kinase is thought to selectively increase translation of a class of growth-regulated mRNAs characterized by the presence of a polypyrimidine tract adjacent to the m7GpppN cap (5′-terminal oligopyrimidine mRNAs) (14Amaldi F. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1997; 18: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Jefferies H.B. Fumagalli S. Dennis P.B. Reinhard C. Pearson R.B. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). A second mechanism that mediates growth factor-induced activation of protein synthesis is phosphorylation of the translation repressor eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) (10Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). In quiescent cells, hypophosphorylated forms of 4E-BP1 bind tightly to eIF4E on the mRNA cap, thus excluding eIF4G from the eIF4F complex. Treatment of cells with growth factors leads to phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on multiple sites and its dissociation from eIF4E, thereby allowing assembly of a functional eIF4F complex (10Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar,16Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Translation of mRNAs with extensive secondary structure at the 5′ end is thought to be particularly sensitive to regulation by 4E-BP1. Treatment of cultured cells with a variety of stimuli leads to the simultaneous phosphorylation of both p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1. In addition, growth factor-induced activation of p70 S6 kinase and disruption of the 4E-BP1·eIF4E complex in vitro is blocked by nanomolar concentrations of the immunosuppressant rapamycin (17Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 18Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The drug exerts this effect by inhibiting the phosphorylation of specific functionally important sites in both proteins (13Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 21Fadden P. Haystead T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Rapamycin, when bound to its intracellular receptor FKBP12, inhibits the function of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a protein kinase whose catalytic domain is structurally related to that of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (22Kunz J.

Immunol. 1998; 10: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Although it is well accepted that mTOR activity is required for p70 S6 kinase activation and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, the mechanism of action of mTOR is controversial. On one hand, it has been proposed that mTOR is a growth factor-activated kinase (24Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 25Sekulic A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T.

Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 27Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34493-34498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been suggested that mTOR inhibits a phosphatase that can dephosphorylate p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 (29; see discussion in Ref. 13Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Francavilla et al. (29Francavilla A. Starzl T.E. Scotti C. Carrieri G. Azzarone A. Zeng Q.H. Porter K.A. Schreiber S.L. Transplantation. 1992; 53: 496-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) showed earlier that injection of rats with rapamycin before partial hepatectomy strongly inhibited DNA synthesis and mitosis in the liver remnant. Since rapamycin is currently being used in liver transplant patients (30Watson C.J. Friend P.J. Jamieson N.V. Frick T.W. Alexander G. Gimson A.E. Calne R. Transplantation. 1999; 67: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), it will be important to determine whether the drug exerts a similar growth inhibitory effect in humans and, if so, to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism. Results from studies in cultured cells would suggest that the growth inhibitory effect of rapamycin in rat liver is due to a reduction in p70 S6 kinase activity and/or 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. However, no in vivo studies have been done to test this hypothesis. In this study, we asked whether rapamycin targets p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 to inhibit liver regeneration. We first tested if p70 S6 kinase activity and functional phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 are altered after partial hepatectomy. Then we determined whether p70 S6 kinase activity and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation are reduced in rapamycin-treated rats. Our data indicate that rapamycin, at a dose that significantly attenuates liver regeneration, selectively inhibits p70 S6 kinase activation but not phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at sites that regulate binding to eIF4E. These results suggest that the in vivoeffect of rapamycin on 4E-BP1 function might differ significantly from that observed in cell culture models, which may have important therapeutic implications for this clinically useful drug. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats weighing ∼250 g were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). The rats were housed in a quiet room with a 12/12-h light/dark cycle. Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All rats undergoing surgery were anesthetized by intramuscular injection with 0.5 ml of 10 mg/ml nalbuphine plus 0.2 ml of a mixture containing 60% ketamine and 40% Rompun. After adequate anesthesia was attained, animals were placed in the supine position, intubated, and ventilated with 100% O2 using an SAR 830 pressure-fed small animal respirator (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). PH rats were subjected to partial hepatectomy as described previously (1Higgins G.M. Anderson R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar). SHAM rats were subjected to a sham operation involving laparotomy and manipulation of the liver without partial hepatectomy. RAPA rats were injected intraperitoneally with 0.4 mg/kg rapamycin (Calbiochem) in 250 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide 2 h before partial hepatectomy, and the same dose of rapamycin was given daily after surgery. Me2SO rats were treated the same as the RAPA group except that 250 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide was injected instead of rapamycin. After surgery on the above animals, the incisions were closed with sutures in two layers, and the rats were fed and watered ad libitum until sacrifice. CONT rats were not subjected to any treatment or handling before sacrifice. For growth factor treatment, laparotomy was performed, and 5 μl of 1 mm insulin (Sigma) or 500 μl of 0.2 mg/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor (Sigma) was injected into the portal vein. The rats were sacrificed 10 min (insulin) or 30 min (epidermal growth factor) after the injection. At specific times postoperatively, animals were weighed and sacrificed by decapitation, and the livers were removed. Livers were weighed, rinsed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax (Janke & Kunkel, Staufen, Germany) in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin). Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at −80 °C. For kinase assays, 50 μl of liver extract was mixed with 300 μl of lysis buffer, and 5 μl of antibody to p70 S6 kinase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added. After 3 h on ice, 12.5 μl of packed protein A-agarose beads were added to each sample, and the tubes were agitated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with S6 kinase assay buffer (31Petritsch C. Woscholski R. Edelmann H.M. Parker P.J. Ballou L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) minus dithiothreitol. S6 kinase activity in the immunoprecipitates was then measured using 40 S ribosomal subunits as substrate as previously described (31Petritsch C. Woscholski R. Edelmann H.M. Parker P.J. Ballou L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The 32P incorporated into S6 was then normalized to equal amounts of extract protein. Protein concentration of liver extracts was determined with a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equal amounts of liver extract protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and then incubated with antibody to p70 S6 kinase, the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (Covance, Richmond, CA), 4E-BP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), eIF4E (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), or 4E-BP1 phosphorylated at Thr-36, Thr-45, Ser-64, or Thr-69 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA; numbering is based on the sequence of the rat protein (32Hu C.

After extensive washing, membranes were incubated with secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The integrated density of bands was quantified using NIH Image 1.62. The 4E-BP1 cDNA was isolated from Swiss mouse 3T3 cell total RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and primers 5′-CGCGAATTCATGTCGGCGGGCAGCAGC (forward) and 5′-CGCGGATCCTTAAATGTCCATCTCAAATTGTGAC (reverse). The PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into pBluescript, and both strands of the insert were sequenced. The insert showed two differences when compared with the published sequence for 4E-BP1 from 3T3-L1 adipocytes (the T at position 109 was C and the G at position 118 was C; Ref. 19Lin T.A. Kong X.

The PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into pcDNA3.1(−). HA-4E-BP1 phosphorylation site mutants were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the following primers (only the forward primers are shown): for Thr-36 to Ala, 5′-GACTACAGCACCGCCCCGGGCGG; for Thr-45 to Ala, 5′-CTCTTCAGCACCGCCCCGGGAGG; for Ser-64 to Ala, 5′-GGAGTGTCGGAACGCACCTGTGGCC; and for Thr-69 to Ala, 5′-CACCTGTGGCCAAAGCACCCCCAAAGG. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands. To construct the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-4E-BP1 fusion protein, primers 5′-CGCGGATCCTGTCGGCGGGCAGCAGC (forward) and 5′-CGCGAATTCTTAAATGTCCATCTCAAATTGTG (reverse) were used to produce a PCR fragment using 4E-BP1 in pBluescript as template. The fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated into pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bacteria were transformed with the expression construct, and the GST-4E-BP1 fusion protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose. COS7 cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/6-cm dish in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum). The next day the cells were transfected with 3 μg of DNA in 3 ml of Opti-MEM plus 7.5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 5 h, the transfection solutions were replaced with growth medium, and the cells were allowed to grow for 2 days. After treatment with insulin or LY294002, the cells were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into cold extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 mm EGTA, 30 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 30 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.2. Homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were retained. Equal amounts of cell lysate protein were subjected to immunoblotting as described above, and the blots were probed with various 4E-BP1 antibodies. 4E-BP1 binding to m7GTP-Sepharose was performed essentially as previously described (34Rybkin I.I. Cross M.E. McReynolds E.M. Lin R.Z. Ballou L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5460-5465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 4E-BP1 protein bound to the beads was eluted by boiling in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and 4E-BP1 was detected by immunoblotting as described above. Francavilla et al. (29Francavilla A. Starzl T.E. Scotti C.

Transplantation. 1992; 53: 496-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) show that injection of rats with 0.1–1 mg/kg rapamycin for 4 days before partial hepatectomy inhibited DNA synthesis and mitosis measured 24–26 h after surgery. A different treatment protocol was used here to examine the effect of rapamycin on the weight of regenerating liver over a longer time course. Rats were injected with vehicle (Me2SO group) or with 0.4 mg of rapamycin/kg of body weight (RAPA group) 2 h before surgery and on each day after partial hepatectomy. Rats in the PH group were subjected to partial hepatectomy only. Livers were removed and weighed 2 days and 4 days after surgery. As expected, the liver remnant of PH rats nearly doubled in size after 2 days and grew to about 80% of the original liver weight by 4 days post-partial hepatectomy (Fig.1). Liver regeneration was suppressed at 2 days in the Me2SO control group but was equivalent to the PH animals after 4 days. By contrast, liver weight in RAPA animals was significantly lower than in the Me2SO controls at both 2 days and 4 days (Fig. 1). Average liver weight in the RAPA group was less than 60% of that in the Me2SO animals 4 days after partial hepatectomy. Inhibition of liver regeneration by rapamycin is probably not due to the immunosuppressive action of the drug because treatment of partially hepatectomized rats with two other immunosuppressants, cyclosporin A and FK506, augments liver regeneration (35Francavilla A. Barone M. Todo S. Zeng Q. Porter K.A. Starzl T.E. Lancet. 1989; 2: 1248-1249Abstract PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy is strongly inhibited by rapamycin treatment of rats using this experimental protocol. The inhibitory effect of rapamycin seen in Fig. 1 suggests that p70 S6 kinase and/or 4E-BP1 might play a role in liver regeneration. Gressner and Wool (36Gressner A.M. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6917-6925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported nearly three decades ago that the phosphate content of ribosomal protein S6 increases significantly within 24 h after partial hepatectomy. Two subsequent studies showed that total S6 kinase activity is elevated in extracts of regenerating rat liver (37Mizuta K. Hashimoto E. Sakanoue Y. Nakamura S. Kondo H. Yamamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 38Nemenoff R.A. Price D.J. Mendelsohn M.J. Carter E.A. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19455-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but reagents were not available at that time to specifically assay p70 S6 kinase. Here we used specific immunocomplex kinase assays to determine whether p70 S6 kinase is activated by partial hepatectomy. Fig. 2 shows that p70 S6 kinase was activated almost 50-fold in the liver of rats 24 h after partial hepatectomy as compared with unhandled rats in the CONT group. Kinase activity in PH rats dropped sharply between 24 and 48 h but was still slightly elevated 96 h after surgery. By contrast, p70 S6 kinase activity in sham-operated animals was not higher than CONT levels at the 24-h time point (Fig. 2). Kinase activity in the SHAM group increased ∼3-fold between 24 and 48 h to a level equivalent to that measured in PH animals. Western blot analysis showed that the amount of p70 S6 kinase protein in SHAM and PH livers at the 24-h time point was similar, but active enzyme from PH animals exhibited an upward mobility shift on SDS-polyacrylamide gels that indicates increased phosphorylation of the enzyme (see Fig.4 B).Figure 4Effect of rapamycin on p70 S6 kinase activation. A, rats were injected intraperitoneally with increasing dosages of rapamycin 2 h before partial hepatectomy. Livers were harvested 24 h after surgery, and p70 S6 kinase activity was measured in extracts. Results from individual animals are shown. B, equal amounts of liver extract protein from animals treated as described under A were subjected to Western blotting, and p70 S6 kinase was detected. C, rats undergoing partial hepatectomy were treated with rapamycin or vehicle as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Livers were harvested at the indicated times after surgery, and p70 S6 kinase activity was measured in extracts. Shown are means ± S.D.; n = 6 for 4-day RAPA and n = 3 for all others.DMSO, Me2SO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next tested whether partial hepatectomy induces hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by using gel mobility shift assays. 4E-BP1 migrates in SDS-polyacrylamide gels as three bands (α, β, and γ). The α band is the least phosphorylated form, and the β and γ bands are more highly phosphorylated species. 4E-BP1 in the liver of CONT rats appeared on Western blots mainly as the β species, and sham operation did not significantly alter the phosphorylation state of the protein at any time examined (Fig.3 A). By contrast, partial hepatectomy led to a substantial increase in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation as judged by the mobility shift of the protein. A significant portion of 4E-BP1 was converted to the highly phosphorylated γ species 24 h post-partial hepatectomy, and this band was still prominent 48 h after the operation (Fig. 3 A). 4E-BP1 in PH rats subsequently underwent some dephosphorylation, as the β band was more intense than the γ band at 96 h (Fig. 3 A). Because 4E-BP1 can be phosphorylated on multiple sites (21Fadden P. Haystead T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), gel mobility shift assays reveal little about the functional state of the protein. To directly assess the effect of partial hepatectomy on binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E, the amount of 4E-BP1 that coprecipitates with eIF4E was measured using the mRNA cap affinity resin m7GTP-Sepharose. Liver extracts of CONT, SHAM, and PH animals were incubated with m7GTP-Sepharose, and 4E-BP1 associated with the beads was visualized on Western blots. A large amount of 4E-BP1 was recovered from extracts of CONT livers due to tight binding between eIF4E and hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1 (Fig.3 B). Binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E was unchanged relative to the control 24 h after"

We show here that the receptor function of GPIb-IX is regulated intracellularly via its link to the filamin-associated membrane skeleton. Deletion of the filamin binding site in GPIbα markedly enhances ristocetin- (or botrocetin)-induced vWF binding and allows GPIb-IX-expressing cells to adhere to immobilized vWF under both static and flow conditions. Cytochalasin D (CD) that depolymerizes actin also enhances vWF binding to wild type GPIb-IX. Thus, vWF binding to GPIb-IX is negatively regulated by the filamin-associated membrane skeleton. In contrast to native vWF, binding of the isolated recombinant vWF A1 domain to wild type and filamin binding-deficient mutants of GPIb-IX is comparable, suggesting that the membrane skeleton-associated GPIb-IX is in a state that prevents access to the A1 domain in macromolecular vWF. In platelets, there is a balance of membrane skeleton-associated and free forms of GPIb-IX. Treatment of platelets with CD increases the free form and enhances vWF binding. CD also reverses the inhibitory effects of prostaglandin E1 on vWF binding to GPIb-IX.

The N-terminal domain of GPIbα contains binding sites for vWF and α-thrombin (for reviews, see Refs. 6Ware J. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 79: 466-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and 7Lopez J.A. Andrews R.K. Afshar-Kharghan V. Berndt M.C. Blood. 1998; 91: 4397-4418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα contains a binding site for filamin (also called actin-binding protein or ABP-280), which links GPIb-IX to cross-linked actin filamental structures underlining the plasma membrane (the membrane skeleton) (8Fox J.E.B.

An intracellular signaling molecule, 14-3-3ζ, is associated with GPIb-IX (10Du X. Harris S.J. Tetaz T.J. Ginsberg M.H. Berndt M.C. J. Biol.

Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18605-18611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the normal circulation, GPIb-IX does not interact with soluble vWF. At sites of vascular injury, the interaction between platelet GPIb-IX and vWF occurs when GPIb-IX is exposed to subendothelium-bound vWF. Interaction of vWF with the subendothelium is thought to induce a conformational change in vWF (14Siediecki C.A. Lestini B.J. Kottke-Marchant K.K. Eppell S.J. Wilson D.L. Marchant R.E.

In this study, we found that vWF binding to GPIb-IX is also regulated by changes in the cytoskeletal association of GPIb-IX. GPIb-IX molecules that are associated with the filamin-linked membrane skeleton are in a “resting” state that inhibits vWF binding function. Dissociation of GPIb-IX from the membrane skeleton or disruption of the membrane skeleton activates vWF binding to GPIb-IX by increasing the accessibility of the binding site in GPIbα. Thus, GPIb-IX-dependent platelet adhesion and activation is likely to be dynamically controlled by a 2-fold regulatory mechanism: exposure of vWF bound to the subendothelial matrix and a membrane skeleton-dependent inside-out signal. Botrocetin and monoclonal antibodies AK2 and WM23 against GPIbα were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Berndt (Baker Medical Institute, Melbourne, Australia) (19Berndt M.C. Du X.P. Booth W.J.

For construction of GPIbα mutants Δ551 and Δ551–570, DNA fragments were synthesized by PCR using wild type GPIbα cDNA (in PGEM3Z(+) vector) as a template, oligonucleotides ACAGTGCCCCGGGCCTGACTGCTCTT (Δ551) and GTGCCCCGGGTACGGCCTAATGGCCGT (Δ551–570) as forward primers, and TTGGATCCTTCTCTCAAGGTCCCCAAAC as the reverse primer. These fragments were digested with SmaI and BamHI and then ligated with GPIbα cDNA in pcDNA3.1(−) vector digested with the same enzymes. Cells expressing comparable levels of GPIb-IX and/or integrin were selected by cell sorting and monitored by flow cytometry. CHO cells expressing wild type and mutant GPIb-IX were detached from the tissue culture plates using 0.5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, pH 7.4. The cells were then either resuspended in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin or in modified Tyrode's buffer (2.5 × 106/ml). Cell suspensions were incubated with ristocetin (1.25 mg/ml) and purified human vWF (20 μg/ml) at 22 °C for 30 min and washed once. In some experiments, botrocetin (2 μg/ml) was used to replace ristocetin. The cells were further incubated in Tyrode's buffer or PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 10 μg/ml FITC-labeled monoclonal antibody SZ29 directed against vWF in the dark at 22 °C for 30 min and then analyzed by flow cytometry. As negative controls, the cells were either incubated with vWF in the absence of ristocetin or incubated with ristocetin in the absence of vWF and then incubated with FITC-labeled SZ29. Nonspecific fluorescence intensity detected from either treatment was identical (not shown), indicating that SZ29 specifically detects ristocetin-dependent vWF binding. Binding of the recombinant A1 domain fragment of vWF was similarly detected using a fluorescently labeled anti-A1 domain monoclonal antibody, NMC-4. The preparation of washed platelets was described previously (33Du X.P. Plow E.F. Frelinger A.L.I. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 409-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 34Gu M. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33465-33471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The washed platelets were resuspended in the modified Tyrode's solution. Resting washed platelets were treated with various concentrations of cytochalasin D and/or PGE1. Me2SO was used as a control for cytochalasin D, 70% ethanol was used as a control for PGE1. After adding botrocetin (2 μg/ml) and 1 mm RGDS (an integrin inhibitor), platelets were incubated with or without vWF for 30 min at room temperature. Detection of vWF binding was performed as described above. Microtiter wells were coated with 10 μg/ml vWF in PBS at 4 °C overnight. Cells in modified Tyrode's solution were incubated in ligand-coated microtiter wells for 30 min at 37 °C. After three washes, 50 μl of 0.3%p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, were added to microtiter wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 1 m NaOH. Results were determined by reading optical density (OD) at 405-nm wave length. The standard curve of acid phosphatase reaction was established by adding the acid phosphatase substrate to various known numbers of the same cells in parallel wells. The acid phosphatase assay of the standards indicates that OD value is proportional to cell numbers. The rate of cell adhesion was estimated by the ratio of the number of adherent cells to number of total cells. CHO cells expressing human platelet receptors (0.5 or 1 × 107/ml) were added to a reconstituted suspension of platelet-depleted human red cells in divalent cation-free Hepes-Tyrode buffer (10 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.4 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm NaHCO3, and 5 mm dextrose), pH 7.4, containing 5% bovine serum albumin with a normal hematocrit value (40%), as previously described (22Miyata S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6586-6593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cell interaction with immobilized vWF under flow conditions was observed in real time by means of epifluorescence videomicroscopy in a modified Hele-Shaw flow chamber (35Usami S. Chen H.H. Zhao Y. Chien S. Skalak R. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 1993; 21: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), as described previously (4Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Purified human vWF was diluted to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml with 2 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, and 200 μl of the protein solution was spread evenly onto a glass coverslip (No. 1, 24 × 50 mm; Corning) that was then incubated in a humid environment at 22 °C for 1 h. After rinsing, the protein-coated surface of the glass coverslip was assembled as the bottom of the flow chamber, and a flow path height of 125 μm was determined by a silicon rubber gasket. The entire flow path of the chamber, mounted on the stage of an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Axiovert 135M, Carl Zeiss Inc.), was kept at 37 °C with a thermostatic air bath. Heterologous cells were visualized by adding mepacrine (quinacrine dihydrochloride; 10 μm, final concentration) or hydroethitine. Reconstituted blood, considered to have the same viscosity of 4 centipoise as native blood, was aspirated through the chamber by a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus Inc.) for the desired time, and all experiments were continuously recorded on videotape using a video cassette recorder (model 9500, Sony). The number of individual cells interacting at any given time with immobilized native vWF was measured on images obtained at different positions in the flow path of the chamber, corresponding to selected wall shear rates. Washed platelets (1 × 109/ml) resuspended in modified Tyrode's solution were incubated with or without 10 μmcytochalasin D for 10 min at 22 °C and then solubilized by adding an equal volume of solubilization buffer (0.1 m Tris, 0.01m EGTA, 0.15 m sodium chloride, and 2% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing 0.2 mm E64 (Sigma) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 4 min and then 100,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C to precipitate the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeleton-associated proteins. For CHO cells, the cells were detached from the tissue culture plate with 0.5 mm EDTA in PBS and resuspended in Tyrode's solution. The cell suspensions were solubilized by adding the above described solubilization buffer containing 20 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.3 units/ml aprotinin, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 mm E64, and 2 mm calpain inhibitor I. After centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C to precipitate the cytoskeleton-associated proteins. The insoluble pellets and supernatants were dissolved in SDS-sample buffer (0.075 mTris, pH 6.8, 12.5% (v/v) glycerol, 2.5% SDS, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) to equal volumes and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody, SZ2 or WM23 (5 μg/ml), against GPIbα. To examine the roles of the GPIbα cytoplasmic domain in regulating the receptor function of GPIb-IX, wild type GPIbα or cytoplasmic domain deletion mutants of GPIbα were coexpressed in CHO cells with GPIbβ and GPIX as previously described (11Du X.

The mutants Δ559 and Δ551 lack the C-terminal residues 560–610 and 552–610, respectively, and thus lack the binding sites for filamin and 14-3-3 (11Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol.

Both Δ559 (Fig. 1) and Δ551 (not shown) are not associated with the Triton X-100-insoluble membrane skeleton and do not bind 14-3-3 (11Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The mutant Δ591 lacks the binding sites for 14-3-3 but retains the filamin binding site and has been previously shown to bind to the membrane skeleton but not 14-3-3 (11Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The mutant Δ551–570 lacks a critical region in the filamin binding site (32Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and thus is not associated with the Triton X-100-insoluble membrane skeleton (Fig. 1). This mutant, however, retains a functional 14-3-3 binding site (Fig. 1). Wild type and the Δ559 mutant GPIb-IX expressed in CHO cells were allowed to bind soluble vWF in the presence of a vWF modulator, ristocetin, which is known to mimic the effect of subendothelial matrix to induce vWF binding to GPIb-IX. Ristocetin-induced binding of vWF to cells expressing wild type GPIb-IX (1b9 cells) is detectable but very low (Fig.2 A). In contrast, ristocetin-induced vWF binding to Δ559 mutant cells is about 10 times higher than to 1b9 cells (Fig. 2 A). The difference in vWF binding to 1b9 cells and Δ559 cells is not due to a difference in the expression levels of GPIb-IX, since expression levels had been adjusted to comparable levels by cell sorting using anti-GPIbα monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 2 B). A different truncation mutant, Δ551 (deleting residues 552–610), similarly had an enhanced vWF binding (not shown). These data indicate that only a small percentage of wild type GPIb-IX binds to vWF, and deletion of the filamin and 14-3-3 binding sites of GPIbα enhances vWF binding function of GPIb-IX. Although the Δ559 mutant lacks both the filamin and 14-3-3 binding sites in the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα, the increase in vWF binding to Δ559 is unlikely to be caused by the lack of 14-3-3 binding site, since cells expressing the mutant Δ591, lacking the GPIbα C-terminal 14-3-3 binding sites (residues 591–610) but retaining the filamin binding site, showed no dramatic increase in vWF binding compared with wild type GPIb-IX (Fig.3 A). Furthermore, cells expressing a GPIbα deletion mutant Δ551–570, lacking the residues required for filamin binding but retaining a functional 14-3-3 binding site, showed a significantly enhanced vWF binding (Fig. 3 B). Thus, a lack of the filamin binding site of GPIbα is responsible for the enhanced vWF binding function. To exclude the possibility that deletion mutation of GPIbα caused a conformational change unrelated to GPIb-IX association with the filamin-linked membrane skeleton actin filaments, cells expressing wild type GPIb-IX were treated with cytochalasin D to disrupt actin filamental structures. This treatment induces a significant increase in vWF binding to GPIb-IX (Fig. 4). Taken together, these data indicate that either disruption of filamin interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα or disruption of actin filamental structure enhances vWF binding function of GPIb-IX. Thus, vWF binding to GPIb-IX is negatively regulated by the filamin-linked membrane skeleton. It is known that the GPIb binding site in vWF is located in the A1 domain (36Sixma J.J. Sakariassen K.S. Stel H.V. Houdijk W.P. In der Maur D.W. Hamer R.J. de Groot P.G. van Mourik J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 37Fujimura Y. Titani K. Holland L.Z.

Blood. 1987; 70: 985-988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the inability of a majority of the wild type GPIb-IX molecules to bind vWF either results from a lack of A1 domain recognition by the wild type GPIb-IX or from a negative regulation that reduces the accessibility of the A1 domain in vWF macromolecules to the binding sites in GPIb-IX. To differentiate these possibilities, we examined ristocetin-induced (Fig.5) or botrocetin-induced (not shown) GPIb-IX binding to a small recombinant A1 domain fragment of vWF containing the GPIb-IX binding site (residues 445–733) (22Miyata S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6586-6593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained either with ristocetin or botrocetin as an inducer. While the binding of the purified native vWF to wild type GPIb-IX is significantly lower than vWF binding to Δ559 mutant cells, the small recombinant A1 domain fragment of vWF showed comparable binding to wild type GPIb-IX and Δ559 mutant (Fig. 5). Thus, association of GPIb-IX with the membrane skeleton negatively regulates the accessibility of the A1 domain in native vWF macromolecules to its binding site in GPIbα. The above results show that ristocetin- or botrocetin-induced binding of soluble vWF to GPIb-IX is regulated by the interaction of the membrane skeleton with the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα. To examine whether ristocetin-induced vWF binding appropriately reflects the function of GPIb-IX to mediate cell adhesion to immobilized vWF, cells expressing wild type GPIb-IX or the mutants were allowed to adhere to vWF-coated microtiter wells at 37 °C for 30 min. As shown in Fig.6 A, cells expressing wild type GPIb-IX (1b9 cells) poorly adhered to immobilized vWF in the absence of vWF modulators. In contrast, adhesion of the Δ559 mutant-expressing cells to immobilized vWF was significantly enhanced. The mutant Δ551–570 cells also showed enhanced adhesion to vWF. These results indicate that filamin-dependent membrane skeleton association regulates the function of GPIb-IX to mediate cell adhesion to immobilized vWF. An important function of GPIb-IX is to mediate initial cell adhesion and rolling under flow conditions. Thus, we examined whether deletion of the filamin-binding site of GPIbα also affects GPIb-IX-mediated cell adhesion under flow. The difference between wild type and mutant GPIb-IX in mediating cell adhesion to immobilized vWF is dramatic under flow conditions (Fig. 6, Band C). Even at a low shear rate of 200 s−1, very few 1b9 cells (wild type) attached or rolled on vWF-coated surfaces. With the increase in shear rate to >500 s−1, almost no 1b9 cells were seen to roll on vWF-coated surfaces. In contrast, when an equal number of Δ559 cells was perfused through the vWF-coated flow chamber, significant cell adhesion and rolling were observed even at a high shear rate of 1500 s−1, suggesting that the mutant GPIb-IX lacking the filamin binding site is able to mediate efficient cell adhesion and rolling on immobilized vWF under high shear rate flow conditions. Thus, GPIb-IX-mediated cell adhesion to vWF under both low and high shear rate conditions is significantly enhanced by disruption of GPIb-IX interaction with the filamin-associated membrane skeleton. Although platelets have two major receptors for vWF, GPIb-IX and the integrin αIIbβ3 (39Ruggeri Z.M. De Marco L. Gatti L. Bader R. Montgomery R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), it is known that ristocetin-induced vWF binding to platelets is GPIb-IX-dependent and unaffected by anti-integrin antibodies (39Ruggeri Z.M. De Marco L. Gatti L. Bader R. Montgomery R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, binding of vWF to GIb-IX has been shown to induce fibrinogen binding to integrin αIIbβ3 (31Gu M. Xi X. Englund G.D. Berndt M.C. Du X. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 40De Marco L. Girolami A. Russell S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1198-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Also, the GPIbα mutant Δ559 enhanced integrin-dependent CHO cell spreading on vWF (31Gu M. Xi X. Englund G.D. Berndt M.C. Du X. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, to study whether the membrane skeleton regulates vWF binding function of GPIb-IX in platelets, we first examined whether the ristocetin-induced vWF binding to cells expressing wild type GPIb-IX or the filamin binding-deficient mutant (Δ559) can be influenced by the presence of the integrin αIIbβ3 in our assay system. To do this, two CHO cells lines coexpressing wild type GPIb-IX (123 cells) and the mutant (Δ559/2b3a) with the integrin αIIbβ3 were examined for ristocetin-induced vWF binding. Similar to cells expressing GPIb-IX alone, ristocetin-induced vWF binding is significantly enhanced in Δ559/2b3a cells compared with 123 cells (wild type) (Fig.7). Ristocetin-induced vWF binding to 123 or Δ559/2b3a cells was unaffected by the integrin inhibitor RGDS peptides (Fig. 7). Thus, ristocetin-induced soluble vWF binding either in wild type or mutant GPIb-IX cells is not significantly influenced by the presence of integrin αIIbβ3. This finding, together with the data obtained with αIIbβ3-deficient cells (Fig. 2), suggests that the enhanced vWF binding in the cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant results from the enhanced ligand binding function of GPIb-IX but not that of GPIb-IX-induced integrin activation. To determine whether the regulation of vWF binding function of GPIb-IX by the membrane skeleton also occurs in platelets, washed resting platelets were pretreated with or without cytochalasin D, which depolymerizes actin filaments. To determine whether cytochalasin D treatment affects GPIb-IX-associated actin filaments, cytochalasin D-treated platelets were solubilized in Triton X-100-containing buffer. Platelet lysates were centrifuged to precipitate Triton X-100-insoluble proteins. Both the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot with an anti-GPIbα antibody, SZ2. As shown in Fig.8 A, cytochalasin D treatment increases the amounts of GPIb-IX in Triton X-100-soluble supernatant, indicat"

In another neuronal cell line, NG108, REST/NRSF also repressed expression from constructs containing an intact RE-1/NRSE. However, unexpectedly, REST/NRSF up-regulated expression levels of constructs lacking an intact RE-1/NRSE.

It was originally thought that the REST/NRSF-RE-1/NRSE system served as a molecular switch that helped distinguish neural from non-neural cell types, as the repression was thought to occur in non-neural cells, which contain REST/NRSF, but not in neural cells, which either lack or contain only relatively low levels of REST/NRSF (6Kraner S.D.

For example, multiple splice variants of REST/NRSF have been identified, including at least one neural-specific form (19Palm K. Belluardo N. Metsis M. Timmusk T. J. Neurosci... 1998; 18: 1280-1296Google Scholar). Additionally, several groups have suggested that REST/NRSF and/or the RE-1/NRSE may serve a dual function, as either repressor or activator, depending on the spatial and temporal context of its expression (1Bessis A. Champtiaux N. Chatelin L. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 5906-5911Google Scholar, 2Chen Z.F. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 1177-1182Google Scholar). Recently, several reports have suggested that REST/NRSF can repress, in part, through association of a domain in its N-terminal with the Sin3A-histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) complex (22Huang Y. Myers S.J. Dingledine R. Nat. Neurosci... 1999; 2: 867-872Google Scholar, 23Naruse Y. Aoki T. Kojima T. Mori N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 13691-13696Google Scholar, 24Roopra A.

Sin3A·HDAC2 is one of several histone deacetylase complexes thought to down-regulate gene expression. Histone deacetylation is thought to lead to a “closed” conformation of the chromatin surrounding a gene, thereby restricting access of the RNA polymerase II complex and, thus, repressing transcription (25Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell.. 1997; 89: 325-328Google Scholar, 26Grunstein M. Nature.. 1997; 398: 349-352Google Scholar). Using trichostatin A (TSA), a HDAC-specific inhibitor that has been shown to disrupt histone deacetylation activity in cell cultures (27Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol.

The nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR), which can interact with Sin3A and other HDACs, including HDAC 3, 4, 5, and 7, has also been shown to mediate REST/NRSF repression in certain genetic contexts (29Jepsen K.

REST/NRSF's C-terminal zinc finger has been shown to associate with at least one other factor, CoREST, to mediate a histone deacetylase-independent repressor activity (22Huang Y. Myers S.J.

In this study, we evaluate the possible function of the REST/NRSF-RE-1/NRSE system in the transcriptional regulation of the corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) gene. CRH is a 41-amino acid hypothalamic neuropeptide that plays a central, well characterized role in development and homeostatic maintenance, modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in response to stress (31Vale W. Spiess J. Rivier C. Rivier J. Science.. 1981; 213: 1394-1397Google Scholar, 32Owens M.J. Nemeroff C.B. Pharmacol. Rev... 1991; 43: 425-473Google Scholar, 33Muglia L. Jacobson L. Dikkes P. Majzoub J.A. Nature.. 1995; 373: 427-432Google Scholar). In this role, secreted CRH stimulates the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the anterior pituitary gland, which, in turn, stimulates the production of glucocorticoids in the adrenal cortex. Glucocorticoids mediate a range of physiological responses to stress (34Munck A. Guyre P.M. Holbrook N.J. Endocr. Rev... 1984; 5: 25-44Google Scholar). Abnormalities of CRH expression or function have been suggested to play a role in many disorders, including Cushing disease, depression, and anorexia nervosa (35Gold P.W. Loriaux D.L. Roy A.

It also may be involved in modulating immune responses (38Karalis K.P. Kontopoulos E. Muglia L.J. Majzoub J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 7093-7097Google Scholar). The RE-1/NRSE sequence found in the first intron of the CRH gene corresponds very closely to the RE-1/NRSE element previously shown to mediate transcriptional repression in other genes (14Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 9881-9886Google Scholar). Finding that the RE-1/NRSE mediates an important regulatory function forCrh transcription would be particularly interesting, as mostin vitro studies to date on Crh transcriptional regulation have relied on constructs of the Crh promoter lacking the intron and, therefore, lacking the RE-1/NRSE element (39Scatena C.D. Adler S. Mol. Endocrinol... 1998; 12: 1228-1240Google Scholar, 40Seasholtz A.F. Thompson R.C. Douglass J.O. Mol. Endocrinol... 1988; 2: 1311-1319Google Scholar, 41Guardiola-Diaz H.M. Boswell C.

In order to examine this possible function, we first show that REST/NRSF binds to the Crh RE-1/NRSE and that this binding is both specific and saturable. We then demonstrate that transcriptional repression of the CRH gene by REST/NRSF requires an intact RE-1/NRSE, both in non-neuronal L6 rat myoblast cells, as well as in the neuronal PC12 rat pheochromocytoma and NG108-15 rat neuroblastoma-glioma cell types. Consistent with previous reports, we show that the Crh transcriptional repression observed in L6 cells is TSA-sensitive, and therefore likely to be linked to HDAC activity, but that this mechanism does not account for the full degree of repression (22Huang Y. Myers S.J. Dingledine R. Nat. Neurosci... 1999; 2: 867-872Google Scholar, 23Naruse Y. Aoki T. Kojima T. Mori N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 13691-13696Google Scholar, 24Roopra A.

We also report the novel finding that REST/NRSF can function as a RE-1/NRSE-independent enhancer ofCrh transcription in NG108 cells. Together, our results suggest that REST/NRSF-RE-1/NRSE activity is quite complex, and both genetic and cellular contexts appear to be critical for determining the net effect on Crh transcriptional activity. Rat myoblast L6 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, MD) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma), rat PC12 cells (kind gift of M. Greenberg, Harvard Medical School and Children's Hospital, Boston, MA) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5% fetal calf serum, and 1% filter-sterilizedl-glutamine (Sigma), and rat NG108 cells (kind gift of Ian C. Wood, Wellcome Laboratory for Molecular Pharmacology, University College London and School of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, United Kingdom) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. All cell cultures also contained 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (Life Technologies, Inc.). PC12 cells were grown on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-treated plates and were passaged a maximum of five times before discarding. Each experiment was conducted using cells of the same passage. Total RNA was prepared from cultured L6 cells, PC12 cells treated with 50 ng/ml NGF (Sigma) for 48 h, and NG108-15 cells treated with 10 μm forskolin, 100 μm 3-isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) (Sigma) for 6 h, using TRI Reagent (Sigma) according to manufacturer's protocol. The recovery of RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically. RNA was digested using DNA-free TM (Ambion), according to the manufacturer's protocol, to eliminate contaminating endogenous DNA. Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized using Superscript IITM reverse transcriptase (RT) (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol, using random hexamers [(pd(N)6] (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as primers. Following an initial 3 min at 96 °C, each PCR cycle (MJ Research) consisted of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a 5-min extension at 72 °C. PCR was also conducted on identical samples lacking RT treatment, to control for any remaining endogenous DNA contamination. PCR reactions were performed on 1/10 of the RT reaction, in 1 × PCR buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using 2 units of Taq enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.4 mm dNTP, and 0.2 μm each primer. The PCR products were separated and visualized in an ethidium bromide containing 1.5% TBE-agarose gel, using a 100-bp DNA ladder (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The sense (S) and antisense (AS) REST/NRSF-specific and actin-specific (control) primers used were as follows: rNRSF-S, GACAGGTTCACAACGGGCC; rNRSF-AS, CCCTTCGGCACTTCGCCGCT; actin-S, ATTCCTATGTGGGCGACGAG; and actin-AS, TGGATAGCAACGTACATGGC (45Shimojo M. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Hersh L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1999; 19: 6788-6795Google Scholar). The primers, rNRSF-S and rNRSF-AS, were intron-spanning, such that RT-PCR utilization of mRNA versus endogenous DNA templates was distinguishable. The primers were specific for full-length REST/NRSF, as distinguished from splice variants such as REST4. Nuclear extracts from L6 cells were prepared according to Schreiber et al. (46Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res... 1989; 17: 6419Google Scholar) from ∼106 cells per extract; Buffer A contained a final concentration of 1.0 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotenin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and Buffer C was the same except for phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, which was at 1.0 mm. Final nuclear extract protein concentration was quantitated by spectrophotometry using a standard curve (BCA Protein Assay Reagent, Pierce). All oligonucleotide probes used were double stranded. They were synthesized as complementary single strands (BIOSOURCE/Keystone) which were then annealed by equimolar mixing, boiling for 5 min and slow cooling to room temperature. Radiolabeled probe was made by 5′ phosphorylation of 1 pmol of the double-stranded (ds) RE-1/NRSE probe with 50 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (product number BLU-2A, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by the T4 polynucleotide kinase forward reaction lasting 30 min at 37 °C, in a total volume of 50 μl. Labeled RE-1/NRSE probe was purified by centrifugation through a Sephadex G-50 QuickSpin column (or G-25 column, for the CRE probe) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Final counts for different experiments were in the range of 6 × 104 to 3 × 105 cpm/μl, and between 11 and 14 fmol of labeled probe were used per lane. Both the RE-1/NRSE probe and the various competitor probes (except for the unrelated CRE probe) contained EcoRI 5′ overhangs for possible use in subcloning. In addition to the 21-bp core of the RE-1/NRSE, we included 9 bp of 5′-flanking DNA and 7 bp of 3′-flanking DNA; this 37-bp sequence was doubled in tandem. For the imperfectly conserved potential RE-1/NRSE (p(RE-1)) sequences, we noted the outside limits of conservation (i.e. the most 3′ and most 5′ conserved bases of the RE-1/NRSE) and counted out both 5′ and 3′ to include an equivalent amount of flanking DNA; some of these probes are therefore longer and some are shorter than the RE-1/NRSE probe. The sequences of the probes used were as follows (only sense strand shown): [γ-32P]RE-1 probe, AATTCGTACCTAGCTTCAGCACCGCGGACAGCGTCACCGAAGTACCTAGCTTCAGCACCGCGGACAGAGTCACCGAAG; RE-1MUT (with mutation underlined in bold), AATTCGTACCTAGCTTCAGCACCGCTTACAGCGTCACCGAAGTACCTAGCTTCAGCACCGCTTACAGAGTCACCGAAG; p(RE-1)A, AATTCGAGCAGAGGCAGCACGCAATCGAGCTGTCAAGAGAGCGTCAGCTTAGAGCAGAGGCAGCACGCAATCGAGCTGTCAAGAGAGCGTCAGCTTAG; p(RE-1)B, AATTCGCTGCTGTGGTGAGCCCCGGAGCCAGCTGCCCATGTGCTGCTGTGGTGAGCCCCGGAGCCAGCTGCCCATGTG; p(RE-1)C, AATTCTGCAGATGCCTCAGCGCTCGCTCGACAGCCGCGCGGAGTGCAGATGCCTCAGCGCTCGCTCGACAGCCGCGCGGAG; p(RE-1)D, AATTCTGTATTTCTGTGTCGTAACAAAACAGCGTTATTTGTTGTATTTCTGTGTCGTAACAAAACAGCGTTATTTGTG;Crh CRE, GCTCGTTGACGTCACCAAGA. Binding buffer (1 ×) was: 20 mm HEPES (pH 8), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm KCl. Poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) was used in binding reaction at a concentration of 0.125 μg/ml. Polyclonal REST antibody (kind gift of Gail Mandel, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY) was used at a 1:100 dilution, ∼416 ng/reaction. The control cAMP-response element-binding protein antibody is described in Waeber et al. (47Waeber G. Meyer T.E. LeSieur M. Hermann H.L. Gerard N. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol... 1991; 5: 1418-1430Google Scholar). Binding buffer, poly(dI-dC), and double-distilled (dd) H2O were combined with nuclear extracts in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and put on ice for 5 min. Competitor oligonucleotides and/or antibodies were added, and the tubes were placed at 4 °C for 10 min. γ-32P-Labeled RE-1/NRSE probe was then added and the reaction was incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. The reactions were then loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel (Proto-Gel, Minneapolis, MN) and run at 175 mV for roughly 3 h at 4 °C. The gels were then vacuum-heat dried and bands were visualized by exposure to autoradiographic film (Kodak) for 3 to 6 h at −80 °C. All primary reporter plasmids were cloned into the pXP2 luciferase backbone (ATTC) (48Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques.. 1988; 6: 454-458Google Scholar). All cloning transformations were performed using Subcloning Efficiency DH5α cells according to manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Source constructs for Crh sequence were: CRH5.0, containing 5 kb of 5′ promoter sequence (B57 mouse) cloned into Bluescript (SKII+) (Stratagene);Xho-Kpn-Kpn, containing the full-length CRH gene plus ∼6-kb flanking sequence (B57 mouse) (49Muglia L.J. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Majzoub J.A. J. Clin. Invest... 1994; 93: 2066-2072Google Scholar). Full-length constructs (Intron(+)WT, Intron(+)MUT) were made as follows: we excised a fragment containing roughly 5 kb of 5′ Crh sequence from CRH 5.0 by cutting at a BamHI site 5 kb upstream from the promoter and at the unique SalI site at position 409 in the promoter. A 3′ contiguous 712-bp SalI-KpnI fragment was then excised from the Xho-Kpn-Kpnconstruct, cutting at the same SalI site and aKpnI site at position 1121. A third contiguous fragment was created by using forward primer starting at (5′ position 1097) CGCACCAGTTGGAGCTTTGCAGGT (3′), and reverse primer, (5′ position 1292) TTTTTTTTAGATCTTAGGGGCGCTCTCTGAAGC (3′), to amplify the sequence flanking the KpnI (1117) site (see underlined, bold below) and up to the translational start site (1292) by PCR (same reagents as above, except using 30 pmol of each primer on 616 ng of template DNA), starting with 96 °C for 2 min and then 24 cycles of: 60 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 2 min; 96 °C, 30 s; followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 4 min. Another forward primer was used to introduce the GG/TT mutation (italics, bold) in the RE-1/NRSE at position 1138–39: (5′ position 1110) CTTTGCAGG TAC CTAGCTTCAGCACCGCTTACAGCGTCACCG (3′). We attached a BglII site at the 5′ end of the reverse primer, with 8 Ts extending to allow for eventual cutting byBglII and cloning into the BglII site of pXP2. The resulting PCR fragments were digested with KpnI andBglII. We then performed a double-ligation of the 712-bpSalI-Kpn and 171-bpKpnI-BglII fragments intoSalI/BglII-digested pXP2. The process was repeated, substituting the GG/TT KpnI-BglII fragment. Finally, the resulting two vectors were digested withBamHI and SalI to allow for insertion of the 5-kbBamHI-SalI fragment to result in the final full-length constructs, Intron(+)WT and Intron(+)MUT. Intron-less constructs were made by cutting the Intron(+)WT construct at the SbfI site at position 541 and the BglII site at position 1310 to excise the intron. Forward and reverse strands of a linker containing theCrh RE-1/NRSE (including flanking sequence, as used in the EMSAs) element and containing a 5′ SbfI half-site were synthesized (BIOSOURCE/Keystone): (forward)GGAGGCATCCTGAGATCT GTACCTAGCTTCAGCACCGCGGACAGCGTCACCGA A; (reverse)GATCT TCGGTGACGCTGTCCGCGGTGCTGAAGCTAGGTACAGATCTCAGGATGCCTCCTGCA. As before, the strands were combined, boiled, and slow-annealed (see EMSA methods). The resulting linker thus contained a CrhRE-1/NRSE + flanker DNA cassette (in italics), preceded by aBglII site (5′) and followed by a BglII half-site (3′). The complete SbfI-BglII linker was cloned into theSbfI/BglII-digested Intron(+)WTconstruct (intron thus removed), thus replacing the intron with theSbfI-BglII, RE-1/NRSE-containing, linker to make the Intron(−)RE1(+) construct. We made the Intron(−)RE1(−) construct by digesting this new vector with BglII to excise the RE-1/NRSE element, and then religating. The Intron(−)RE1MUT construct was created by following the same procedure used to make Intron(−)RE1(+), simply substituting a GG/TT mutated linker for the one detailed above. All constructs were purified using well established miniprep (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or maxiprep (Qiagen) procedures and were sequenced across the full promoter and transcribed regions, including all cloning junctions, to verify correct sequence. DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels using the Qiaex II and QIAquick gel extraction kits (Qiagen). We transfected all cell lines in 24-well plates, using FuGene6 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). FuGene:DNA ratio was kept at 3:1 in all experiments. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed using 1 × Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). We controlled for total DNA in all co-transfection experiments, replacing REEX-1 with an empty vector, and also controlled for transfection efficiency by co-transfecting a second, thymidine kinase- or cytomegalovirus-driven, reporter in all experiments. Null vector (pXP2) values were subtracted from all measurements. In some experiments, 100 nm TSA was applied for 24 h prior to lysis. Each well in the L6 transfections contained 0.5 μg of pRL-TK (Promega) with 0.5 μg of firefly reporter vector (full-length constructs) or 0.2 μg of pRL-TK with 0.2 μg of firefly reporter (intron-less constructs). Signal measurement was done using the Dual Luciferase Assay kit, according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega). PC12 and NG108 transfections were also conducted in 24-well plates. PC12 cells were transfected with 10 ng of cytomegalovirus-CAT (Invitrogen) and 0.2 μg of firefly reporter, along with 0.2 μg of either pcDNA1.1/amp (Invitrogen) or REEX-1 (REST expression cassette in pcDNA1/amp backbone, kindly provided by Gail Mandel). NGF was applied to PC12 cells at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml, for 48 h prior to lysis by 1 × Passive Lysis Buffer. CAT assays were performed using the Promega kit, according to manufacturer's protocol (14C-labeled chloramphenicol from PerkinElmer Life Sciences). NG108 cells were transfected identically to the PC12 cells, both initially using CAT and then using β-galactosidase, to normalize transfection efficiency. Results reported herein used β-galactosidase, but no difference was seen when CAT was used. In individual experiments, we used either 0.1 g or 0.01 μg of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase (CLONTECH). After confirming that results were identical to using pcDNA1.1/amp, in some experiments we used pBluescript to equalize total DNA in all wells. NG108 cells were treated with 10 μmforskolin, 100 μm IBMX for 6 h prior to lysis by 1 × Passive Lysis Buffer. β-Galactosidase was measured according to manufacturer's instructions, using the Luminescent β-galactosidase Detection Kit II (CLONTECH). All firefly luciferase, Renilla luciferase, and β-galactosidase readouts were conducted on an signal integrating Berthold LB 9501 luminometer. Luciferase expression data are displayed as the means (after normalization to CAT or β-galactosidase expression), with standard errors shown in the positive direction. Statistical significance was evaluated using the Student's t test, with the Bon Feronni correction for multiple comparisons, where appropriate. The RE-1/NRSE noted by Shoenherret al. (14Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 9881-9886Google Scholar) in the first intron of the CRH gene shares considerable similarity, varying by only one nucleotide in human, to a consensus sequence derived from the comparison of RE-1/NRSE elements found in 19 different genes, many of which have been shown to be regulated by REST/NRSF in vitro (14Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 9881-9886Google Scholar). The RE-1/NRSE element is also highly conserved among the CRH genes of several species, including mouse, the focus of the present study (Fig.1). In all mammalian species, theCrh RE-1/NRSE is located in the gene's single intron (position 1127 in mouse), ∼140 bp upstream from the beginning of the second exon, which encodes prepro-CRH. Moreover, the 21-bp element is more highly conserved than the rest of the intron, as well. Outside of the RE-1/NRSE, the Crh intron is roughly 75% conserved (90% rat/mouse; ∼73% human/rat, mouse; 76% human/sheep; ∼67% sheep/rat, mouse). The RE-1/NRSE element is 90–95% identical among all species examined to date, including Xenopus (14Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 9881-9886Google Scholar). This high degree of conservation, combined with the non-coding, intronic position of the element suggests t"

Extracellular administration of GSNO (2 mm) rapidly reduced whole-cell Ba2+currents through channels derived either by expression of α1C-b or by coexpression of α1C-b plus β2a and α2-δ. The non-thiol nitric oxide (NO) donors 2,2-diethyl-1-nitroso-oxhydrazin (2 mm) and 3-morpholinosydnonimine-hydrochloride (2 mm), which elevated cellular cGMP levels to a similar extent as GSNO, failed to affect Ba2+ currents significantly. Intracellular administration of copper ions, which promote decomposition of the thionitrite, antagonized its inhibitory effect, and loading of cells with high concentrations of dithiothreitol (2 mm) prevented the effect of GSNO on α1C-b channels. Intracellular loading of cells with oxidized glutathione (2 mm) affected neither α1C-b channel function nor their modulation by GSNO.

Cellular regulation of Ca2+ current was suggested to depend at least in part on NO-induced activation of guanylyl cyclase and subsequent modification of the phosphorylated state of channel proteins (8Jiang L.H.

However, S-nitrosothiols (thionitrites) were recently demonstrated to exert a potent inhibitory effect on class C, L-type Ca2+ channels, which was suggested to be independent of intracellular cGMP accumulation (12Hu H. Chiamvimonvat N. Yamagishi T. Marban E. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 742-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a more direct modulation of L-type Ca2+ channels by NO donors appears likely. So far it is unclear whether the inhibition of Ca2+ channels by thionitrites requires the release of NO and how single-channel properties are affected by this mechanism of regulation. Modulation of Ca2+ channels by theS-nitrosothiol nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) appears to be of particular physiological interest, because GSNO is the most abundant endogenous thionitrite and has been suggested as a potential NO storage site or transport species (11Mayer B.

In the present study we investigated whether Ca2+ channel inhibition by GSNO involves (i) decomposition of the thionitrite to yield NO, (ii) transnitrosation reactions, or (iii) the formation of mixed disulfides. Moreover, the changes in single Ca2+ channel function associated with GSNO-induced inhibition were characterized. Our results strongly suggest intracellular S-nitrosation as a mechanism involved in physiological control of Ca2+ channel function and demonstrate a unique modification of Ca2+ channel function by GSNO, involving joint alteration of gating and permeability of the pore-forming α1C subunit. α1C-b channels 2SPTREMBL Q28676. were stably expressed in HEK293 cells (18Biel M. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hullin R. Stuhmer W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In some sets of experiments, cells were transfected to express β2a and α2-δ subunits 3GenBank™/EMBL accession number X64298. 4SPTREMBL Q9NY47., in addition to the pore-forming subunit. Positively transfected cells were identified because of the expression of the human T-cytotoxic cell cluster of differentiation (CD8) as a marker gene (19Hohaus, A., Poteser, M., Romanin, C., Klugbauer, N., Hofmann, F., Morano, I., Haase, H., and Groschner, K. (2000) 348,657–665.Google Scholar). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum and 0.25 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). Whole-cell membrane currents were recorded with a bath solution containing (in mm) 40 BaCl2, 60 NaCl, 30 tetraethylammoniumchloride, 15 HEPES, 0.5 EDTA, pH adjusted to 7.4 with methane sulfonic acid. The pipette solution contained (in mm) 115 cesium methanesulfonate, 20 CsCl, 15 HEPES, 10 EGTA, pH 7.4 adjusted withN-methyl-d-glucamine. For single-channel cell-attached recordings, the whole-cell bath solution was used as pipette solution. In experiments with single α1C-b channels, the pipette solution was supplemented with S-Bay-K 8644 (1 μm) to increase open times to a level that allows reasonable analysis of conductance and gating. The bath solution in these experiments contained (in mm) 110 potassium aspartate, 50 Tris, 10 KCl, 3 EGTA, and 2 MgCl2 at a pH of 7.4 adjusted with N-methyl-d-glucamine. Pipettes (2–5 megohm) were pulled from borosilicate glass (Clark Electromedical Instruments, Pangbourne, United Kingdom) and were coated with Sigmacoat (Sigma) for single-channel recordings. Experiments were performed in a 200 μl bath chamber with a gravity-driven perfusion system. Currents were recorded at room temperature using an EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier (List, Darmstadt, Germany). Signals were low pass-filtered at 1 kHz and digitized with 5 kHz. Voltage clamp protocols (depolarizing pulses from −70 to +30 mV or voltage ramps from −100 to +80 mV/0.6 V/s; 0.2 Hz) were controlled by pClamp software using a Digidata 1200 computer interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Analysis of channel gating (open probability (Po) and availability (Ps)) was performed with custom-made software (20Baumgartner W. Schindler H. Romanin C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 82: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test considering a level ofp < 0.05 as significant. For analysis of effects on whole-cell currents, the slow run-down of Ba2+ current was accounted for by averaging the values immediately before administration and after washout of drugs to obtain the reference (control) value. HEK293 stably expressing α1C-b channel protein were subcultured on 24-well plates and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in a buffer containing (in mm) 110 potassium aspartate, 50 Tris, 10 KCl, 3 EGTA, and 2 MgCl2 at a pH of 7.4 adjusted withN-methyl-d-glucamine. Cells were incubated in the presence of 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine with NO donors (GSNO, SIN-1, or DEA/NO) for 4 min, and the incubation was stopped by removal of medium and addition of 0.01 m HCl. cGMP was measured in the samples by radioimmunoassay (3Schmidt K. Mayer B. Kukovetz W.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 170: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). GSNO, as well as 8-Br-cGMP, was dissolved freshly in the bath solution. For administration of SIN-1 and DEA/NO, 100 mm stock solutions were prepared in water or 10 mm NaOH, respectively. Neocuproine (2, 9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline) was directly dissolved in the pipette solution. Diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA) was dissolved in 10 mm NaOH and further diluted in pipette solution. All NO donors were obtained from Alexis (San Diego, CA), and all other compounds were from Sigma. Fig.1 compares the effects of GSNO, DEA/NO, and SIN-1 on whole-cell Ba2+ currents through α1C-b channels. Extracellular administration of GSNO (2 mm) rapidly inhibited the inward Ba2+ currents as illustrated in Fig. 1, A and B. The current to voltage relation was not affected by GSNO (not shown). GSNO was tested at concentrations between 50 μm and 2 mm, which inhibited α1C-b currents in the range of 13 ± 5% (50 μm; n = 3) to 38 ± 6% (2 mm; n = 17). Neither DEA/NO nor SIN-1 mimicked the action of GSNO. DEA/NO (2 mm) moderately promoted the Ba2+ current run-down (Fig. 1 C), and SIN-1 (2 mm) failed to affect α1C-b currents (Fig.1 D). Similarly, channels comprised of α1C-b, β2a, and α2-δ, corresponding to channel complexes expressed in cardiovascular tissues (21Angelotti T. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Reimer D. Huber I.G. Garcia M.L. Haase H. Striessnig J.

Only GSNO exerted a significant inhibitory action on Ba2+ currents (Fig.3 A) through α1C-b channels, whereas all three compounds elevated cellular cGMP levels to a similar extent (about 40-fold; see Fig. 2 B). These measurements of cGMP levels were performed in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (1 mm). When 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine was omitted, significant rises in cellular cGMP were detectable only with DEA/NO (1.3-fold) but not with GSNO or SIN-1. 5M. Poteser and K. Groschner, unpublished observations. Thus the effect of the NO donors were not correlated with cGMP accumulation. To test whether intracellular decomposition of GSNO to yield NO was required for the observed Ca2+ channel modulation, the action of GSNO was studied under conditions that promote decomposition of the thionitrite within the cell. Copper ions are well known to effectively promote homolytic cleavage of GSNO and were therefore considered as a suitable tool to deliberately increase the decomposition rate. Because reduced metal ions, in particular Cu+, were reported to catalyze decomposition of GSNO (15Gorren A.C.F. Schrammel A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 23Gordge M.P. Meyer D.J. Hothersall J. Neild G.H. Payne N.N. Dutra A.A.N. Br. J.

Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), both CuSO4 (50 μm) and the reductant DTT (500 μm) were included in the pipette solution. If decomposition of GSNO within the cell was essential to Ca2+ channel inhibition, loading of the cells with copper ions would be expected to enhance inhibition, otherwise this treatment should suppress the action of the thionitrite. Fig. 4 A shows that the effects of GSNO (2 mm) on whole-cell Ba2+ currents were completely abolished in cells that were loaded with a pipette solution containing 50 μm CuSO4 plus DTT (500 μm). To confirm that this inhibition is dependent on metal ions we performed experiments using the metal chelators neocuproine (50 μm) plus DTPA (50 μm) to remove catalytically active metal ions, in particular Cu+. Addition of neocuproine plus DTPA recovered the inhibitory effects of GSNO to the extent observed in presence of DTT (500 μm) alone (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus the intracellular presence of metal ions significantly antagonized the inhibitory action of GSNO. Nonetheless, the inhibitory effects of GSNO observed in the presence of DTT (500 μm) plus metal chelators or in the presence of DTT (500 μm) alone were significantly blunted as compared with control (see Figs. 1 and 2), indicating that DTT by itself interferes with the action of the thionitrite.Figure 4Inhibition of whole-cell Ba2+currents by GSNO is antagonized by intracellular administration of copper ions. Time courses of peak Ba2+ current recorded at 30 mV in the presence of 50 μmCuSO4/500 μm DTT (A) and in the presence of 50 μm CuSO4/500 μmDTT plus the metal chelators neocuproine (1 mm) and DTPA (50 μm) (B) in the pipette solution are shown.

Theasterisk indicates a statistically significant difference.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An excess of DTT is expected to compete with cellular thiols in terms of transnitrosation or oxidation and is therefore expected to inhibit thionitrite effects that are based on these reactions. Indeed, GSNO-induced inhibition of whole-cell Ba2+ currents in cells dialyzed with 500 μmDTT plus metal chelators was clearly less pronounced (15 ± 4%;n = 6) as compared with control conditions (38 ± 6%; n = 17). Therefore we tested whether loading of the cells with high concentrations of DTT (2 mm) by itself is sufficient to prevent the action of GSNO. Fig.5 illustrates that GSNO barely inhibits α1C-b currents in cells that were dialyzed with 2 mm DTT (n = 6). Prevention of GSNO effects by excess of DTT was not dependent on metal ions as metal chelators did not recover inhibitory effects of GSNO in the presence of 2 mm DTT. Inhibition of GSNO effects by intracellular DTT suggests an intracellular transnitrosation or glutathionylation reaction as the chemical basis of GSNO effects. To test whether oxidation of thiols and/or the formation of mixed disulfides can account for the effects of GSNO, we performed experiments in which the cells were loaded with 2 mm oxidized glutathione (GSSG). As shown in Fig.5 B, dialysis with GSSG failed to suppress α1C-b currents (n = 3) and did not affect the inhibitory action of GSNO. Thus GSNO-induced modulation of α1C-b channels is suggested to be based on the nitrosation of critical thiol residues. Inhibition by GSNO of α1C-b channels was confirmed in single-channel recordings, using the cell-attached configuration (Fig. 6). Note that in this recording configuration, access of bath-applied GSNO to the channels in the patch requires transport across the cell membrane. Overall channel activity in cell-attached patches (mean patch current) decreased to values between 40 and 10% of control within a 2- to 10-min exposure to GSNO (2 mm), respectively. Prolonged exposure to GSNO resulted in complete loss of channel activity in most experiments. The inset in Fig. 6 A shows that the control activity in cell-attached patches was fairly stable during prolonged perfusion with bath solution. Fig. 6 B summarizes the inhibitory effects of GSNO observed in cell-attached experiments. A similar inhibition was observed in cells expressing α1C-b*β2a*α2-δ as illustrated in Fig.7. Neither DEA/NO (2 mm) nor SIN-1 (2 mm) or 8-Br-cGMP (2 mm) exerted a significant inhibitory modulation (data not shown). In an attempt to gain further information on Ca2+ channel modulation by GSNO, we analyzed the changes in single-channel gating properties induced by the thionitrite. Because most of the cell-attached patches contained more than one channel, we analyzed single-channelPo and Ps, as well as the number of active channels in the patches, by use of a recently developed method (20Baumgartner W. Schindler H. Romanin C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 82: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) that allows the analysis of multichannel data. GSNO inhibited α1C-b, as well as α1C-b*β2a*α2-δ, channels mainly by reduction of Po (Fig.8). In addition we observed a slight reduction of Ps from 0.48 ± 0.02 to 0.31 ± 0.03 for α1C-b, which was statistically significant, and from 0.39 ± 0.05 to 0.31 ± 0.06 for α1C-b*β2a*α2-δ channels. It is of note that the single-channel experiments with α1C-b were performed in the presence of S-Bay-K 8644 (1 μm) to prolong open times and to enable a reasonable analysis of the data. A detailed inspection of single-channel currents during the onset of the inhibitory modulation revealed that GSNO induced the transient occurrence of a reduced conductance state. This GSNO-induced subconductance level was detectable in the early phase of GSNO-induced channel modulation in 1 of 5 patches with α1C-b*β2a*α2-δ and in 3 of 9 patches with α1C-b channels. A typical experiment is illustrated in Fig.9. The GSNO-induced conductance state exhibited relatively long dwell times at a current amplitude of ∼0.4 pA (at 40 mm Ba2+ and 0 mV) corresponding to a subconductance level of ∼50% of the full conductance state. These results provide evidence for a combined modulation of gating and permeability properties of the α1C-b subunit by GSNO as the basis of its inhibitory effects on L-type Ca2+ channels.Figure 7GSNO inhibits unitary Ba2+currents through α1C-b*β2a*α2-δ channels in the cell-attached configuration.

Three potential NO donors (GSNO, DEA/NO, and SIN-1) were compared for their effects on whole-cell Ba2+ currents in HEK293 cells stably transfected with the smooth muscle Ca2+channel α1C-b subunit. All three compounds are well known to increase cGMP levels in various cellular systems (6Mery P.F. Pavoine C. Belhassen L. Pecker F. Fischmeister R. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Despite this principle similarity, the three compounds favor distinct chemical reactions that have been suggested to mediate (patho-) physiological effects of NO (26Beckmann J.S. Beckmann T.W.

Invest. 1995; 96: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). DEA/NO releases NO, which is readily available to stimulate soluble guanylyl cyclase, whereas SIN-1 decomposes to produce both NO and superoxide (28Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F. Nims R.W. Saavedra J.E. Ford P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), two species that combine rapidly to form peroxynitrite, a well known nitrating and oxidizing species. It is unlikely that peroxynitrite contributes to the effects of GSNO in our whole-cell experiments, because HEPES, which has recently been demonstrated to react with peroxynitrite to form NO donors (29Schmidt K. Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 859-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), was used as a buffer system. GSNO, by contrast, not only decomposes slowly to release NO but is, in addition, able to react with protein thiol groups to form S-nitrosothiols or mixed disulfides (30Ji Y. Akerboom T.P.M. Sies H. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Consistent with the view that all three compounds release NO under certain conditions, they all elevated cGMP levels of HEK293 cells, with DEA/NO being most effective. In clear contrast to its superior action as a stimulator of soluble guanylyl cyclase, DEA/NO exerted rather moderate inhibitory effects on L-type Ca2+ channels, indicating that cGMP does not control α1C-b channels in the HEK293 expression system. The notion that the observed Ca2+channel inhibition by GSNO does not involve cGMP was further corroborated by the observation that 8-Br-cGMP (2 mm) did not affect α1C-b channels in cell-attached experiments. These results are in line with a previous study demonstrating that inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels by S-nitrosothiols is insensitive to inhibition of soluble guanylyl cyclase (12Hu H. Chiamvimonvat N. Yamagishi T. Marban E. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 742-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus GSNO appears to exert a specific, cGMP-independent effect on L-type Ca2+ channels. To test whether this effect of GSNO is based on a direct interaction of the thionitrite with intracellular protein thiol residues or requires the release of NO, we studied its effect in cells loaded with copper ions to promote decomposition of GSNO (13Butler A.R. Rhodes P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 14Dicks, A. P., Swift, H. R., Williams, L. H., Butler, A. R., Al-Sa'doni, H. H., and Cox, B. G. (1996)J. Chem. Soc.

Both conditions clearly blunted or even eliminated the action of GSNO, supporting the concept that Ca2+ channel modulation by GSNO involves a reaction of the thionitrite with intracellular sulfhydryls. Two types of reaction between GSNO and protein thiol residues were considered, transnitrosation and glutathionylation. Our observation that even excessive loading of cells with GSSG failed to affect channel function, which argued against glutathionylation as a mechanism of channel modulation. This conclusion is further supported by our previous experiments with the lipophilic oxidanttert-butylhydroperoxide, which is known to induce oxidation of cellular thiols and formation of mixed disulfides but failed to affect α1C-b channels in the HEK293 expression system.5Thus we suggest nitrosation of critical protein thiol groups as a mechanism of L-type Ca2+ channel regulation. The modest inhibitory effects observed with the NO donor DEA/NO may, therefore, be because of nitrosation of thiol groups, a reaction that was shown to occur at high concentrations of NO in the presence of oxygen (28Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F. Nims R.W. Saavedra J.E. Ford P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate about the modification of a critical cysteine residue of the Ca2+ channel α1 subunit itself as the regulatory principle mediating the effects of GSNO. Although modification of a yet unknown regulatory protein cannot be excluded, our experiments demonstrate that Ca2+ channel regulation by GSNO does not require expression of any of the known auxiliary subunits of the channel. Thus the α1C protein appears to be the most likely target for GSNO modulation. An intracellular localization of the regulatory thiol residue is suggested by the following lines of evidence: (i) the effects of GSNO were sensitive to intracellular administration of copper ions and DTT, and (ii) GSNO inhibited L-type Ca2+ channels not only in the whole-cell but also in the cell-attached configuration of the patch clamp technique. A truncated form of α1C that lacks the cytoplasmic C-terminal 438 amino acids including 13 cysteine residues was also sensitive to inhibition by GSNO.5 The sequence of this truncated α1C includes 11 cysteine residues that are potentially accessible from the cytoplasmic side and may be considered as candidates for a regulation by transnitrosation. Our analysis of the inhibitory effect of GSNO on single-channel parameters revealed that the reduction of whole-cell currents was mainly because of suppression of single-channel open probability. In addition we observed a slightly reduced channel availability and number of active channels in the patches already within 5–10 min of exposure to GSNO, and channel activity was completely lost during prolonged (>10 min) exposure. A detailed inspection of the single-channel behavior during the development of GSNO inhibition uncovered a striking phenomenon. A defined and reproducible subconductance level of about 50% of the full unitary conductance was recorded in about 30% of the experiments. This conductance state was observed only transiently during the development of the GSNO-induced inhibition of channel activity. Thus we report here on a subconductance state of α1C-b channels that is induced by a potential (patho-) physiologic regulator of L-type Ca2+channels. The transient nature of the GSNO-induced subconductance state precluded a more detailed analysis of this phenomenon. Nonetheless, our results strongly suggest that GSNO exerts a modulatory effect on both gating and permeation in the α1C-b protein. The observed GSNO-induced modulation of gating and conductance was independent of the expression of auxiliary β2a and α2-δ subunits and may well explain inhibitory effects of nitrosothiols on native cardiovascular Ca2+ channels (5Campell D.L.

In summary, we provide evidence for inhibitory modulation by GSNO of the principle pore-forming subunit of smooth muscle L-type Ca2+ channels by intracellular S-nitrosation. GSNO-mediated regulation of Ca2+ channels involves unique changes in the functional properties of the pore-forming α1 subunit and may represent an important mechanism that links NO signaling to Ca2+ channel functions in the cardiovascular system.

https://openalex.org/W2073197630,"According to a recent hypothesis, glycosphingolipids originating from the plasma membrane are degraded in the acidic compartments of the cell as components of intraendosomal and intralysosomal vesicles and structures. Since most previous in vitro investigations used micellar ganglioside GM2 as substrate, we studied the degradation of membrane-bound ganglioside GM2 by water-soluble β-hexosaminidase A in the presence of the GM2 activator protein in a detergent-free, liposomal assay system. Our results show that anionic lipids such as the lysosomal components bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate or phosphatidylinositol stimulate the degradation of GM2 by β-hexosaminidase A up to 180-fold in the presence of GM2 activator protein. In contrast, the degradation rate of GM2 incorporated into liposomes composed of neutral lysosomal lipids such as dolichol, cholesterol, or phosphatidylcholine was significantly lower than in negatively charged liposomes. This demonstrates that both, the GM2 activator protein and anionic lysosomal phospholipids, are needed to achieve a significant degradation of membrane-bound GM2 under physiological conditions. The interaction of GM2 activator protein with immobilized membranes was studied with surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy at an acidic pH value as it occurs in the lysosomes. Increasing the concentration of bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate in immobilized liposomes led to a significant drop of the resonance signal in the presence of GM2 activator protein. This suggests that in the presence of bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, which has been shown to occur in inner membranes of the acidic compartment, GM2 activator protein is able to solubilize lipids from the surface of immobilized membrane structures.

The degradation of glycosphingolipids (GSLs)1 endocytosed from the plasma membrane takes place in the acidic compartments of the cell. According to a recently proposed hypothesis of the topology of lysosomal digestion (1Sandhoff K. Kolter T. Trends Cell Biol... 1996; 6: 98-103Google Scholar), GSLs reach the lysosomal compartments as membrane-bound components of intraendosomal and intralysosomal vesicles and structures. The degradation of GSLs with short oligosaccharide head groups and ceramide requires two proteins: a water-soluble lysosomal sphingolipid hydrolase and a sphingolipid activator protein (SAP) (2Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1992; 1126: 1-16Google Scholar,3Klein A. Henseler M. Klein C. Suzuki K. Harzer K. Sandhoff K. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1994; 200: 1440-1447Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that SAPs mediate the interaction of water-soluble sphingolipid hydrolases with their respective membrane-bound substrates (4Wilkening G. Linke T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 30271-30278Google Scholar). The enzymatic, lysosomal degradation of the ganglioside GM2 is catalyzed by β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) and requires the GM2 activator protein (GM2AP) as cofactor (5Meier E.M. Schwarzmann G. Fürst W. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 1879-1887Google Scholar). Human lysosomal β-hexosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.52) cleave off terminal β-glycosidically-bound N-acetylglucosamine andN-acetylgalactosamine residues from a number of glycoconjugates, including glycoproteins, oligosaccharides, and GSLs such as GM2, its asialo derivative GA2, and globoside (6Gravel R.A. Clarke J.T.R. Kaback M.M. Mahuran D. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. und Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease.McGraw-Hill Inc. 1995; : 2839-2879Google Scholar). A total of three different β-hexosaminidase isoenzymes have been identified. These are composed of different combinations of two noncovalently linked, structurally related subunits, α and β (7Mahuran D.J. Lowden J.A. Can. J. Biochem... 1980; 58: 287-294Google Scholar, 8Sandhoff K. Harzer K. Wässle W. Jatzkewitz H. J. Neurochem... 1971; 18: 2469-2489Google Scholar, 9Geiger B. Arnon R. Sandhoff K. Am. J. Hum.

The β-homodimer is called the β-hexosaminidase B, the α-homodimer is called the β-hexosaminidase S, and the α,β-heterodimer is called the β-hexosaminidase A. Despite the fact that the active sites of the α and the β subunits are functionally very similar, the three isoenzymes have different substrate specificities (11Kytzia H.J. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem... 1985; 260: 7568-7572Google Scholar). Only HexA is able to hydrolyze GM2 in the presence of the GM2AP at significant rates (12Sandhoff K. Conzelmann E. Nehrkorn H. Hoppe Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem... 1977; 358: 779-787Google Scholar). Defects or mutations in the genes of the subunits α and β or the gene encoding the GM2AP lead to the various forms of GM2 gangliosidosis. These storage diseases manifest themselves by a massive accumulation of GM2 and related glycolipids in neuronal lysosomes, leading to severe neurodegeneration. Depending on the defect and its severity, other tissues may also be affected by minor lipid and oligosaccharide accumulation (6Gravel R.A. Clarke J.T.R. Kaback M.M. Mahuran D. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. und Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease.McGraw-Hill Inc. 1995; : 2839-2879Google Scholar). GM2AP is one of five known SAPs. Saposin (SAP)-A, -B, -C, and -D are derived from a single precursor protein, prosaposin, through proteolytic processing (2Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1992; 1126: 1-16Google Scholar). GM2AP is first synthesized as a 22-kDa precursor protein, which is subsequently processed in the lysosomes to the mature 20-kDa protein (13Glombitza G.J. Becker E. Kaiser H.W. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 5199-5207Google Scholar). Physicochemical measurements with lipid monolayers demonstrated the membrane-active properties of the GM2AP. GM2AP can immerse into monolayer membranes with a lateral pressure of up to 25 millinewtons/m. The lateral pressure of biological membranes is believed to be significantly higher (14Giehl A. Lemm T. Sandhoff K. Blume A. Eur. J. Biochem... 1999; 261: 650-658Google Scholar). It is conceivable, however, that the lateral pressure of the inner membranes of late endosomes and lysosomes could be less than 25 millinewtons/m due to their high degree of curvature and the enrichment of the unusual lysophospholipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) (15Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerlose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature.. 1998; 392: 193-197Google Scholar). Studies on the degradation of glucosylceramide show that glucocerebrosidase requires negatively charged detergents or phospholipids to reach its full enzymatic activity in vitro(16Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Barca A. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 16862-16867Google Scholar, 17Morimoto S. Kishimoto Y. Tomich J. Weiler S. Ohashi T. Barranger J.A. Kretz K.A. O'Brien J.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 1933-1937Google Scholar). Negatively charged lipids such as dolichol phosphate (DoP) and BMP, which were identified as components of the membrane of late endosomes and lysosomes (15Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerlose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature.. 1998; 392: 193-197Google Scholar, 18Cojnacki T. Dallner G. Biochem. J... 1988; 251: 1-9Google Scholar), stimulated the degradation of membrane-bound glucosylceramide by glucocerebrosidase and SAP-C in a detergent-free, liposomal system up to 35-fold (4Wilkening G. Linke T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 30271-30278Google Scholar). So far, in vitro studies on the degradation of GM2 were mostly performed using micellar ganglioside GM2 as substrate and have never been executed in the presence of anionic phospholipids. To analyze the influence of anionic lysosomal phospholipids on the hydrolysis of the membrane bound ganglioside, GM2 was incorporated into liposomes of varying composition, mimicking intralysosomal vesicles. The degradation rate of membrane-bound GM2 by HexA and GM2AP was studied as a function of the concentration of anionic lysosomal phospholipids in liposomes at acidic pH values, which prevail in the lysosomal compartment. We also investigated the influence of membrane curvature on the degradation rate using liposomes of varying size. Phosphatidylcholine (egg yolk) (PC), phosphatidylinositol (bovine liver) (PI), phosphatidic acid (egg yolk) (PA), dolichol (porcine liver), dolicholphosphate (porcine liver) (DoP), and cholesterol (Chol) were purchased from Sigma. Lichroprep RP18 was obtained from Merck. All other chemicals were of analytical grade or the highest purity available. Ganglioside GM2 was tritiated by the galactose oxidase/[3H]NaBH4 method of Novak (1979) (19Novak A. Lowden J.A. Gravel Y.L. und Wolfe L.S. J. Lipid Res... 1979; 20: 678-681Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 104 Ci/mol. TLC followed by autoradiography did not reveal any contamination of the labeled GM2. BMP was prepared as described previously (4Wilkening G. Linke T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 30271-30278Google Scholar). HexA was purified from human liver to apparent homogeneity according to Schütte (20Schütte C.G. Structure-Analysis of β-Hexosaminidase B and GM2 Activator Protein with Protein-Chemical Methods and MALDI-Mass Spectrometry. Ph.D. dissertation. Universität Bonn, 1999Google Scholar). Purity and identity were ascertained by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot. One unit of enzyme activity (U) is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of 4-methylumbelliferyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside (MUG)/min at 37 °C. Recombinant GM2AP was expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system and purified as described previously (21Schütte C.G. Lemm T. Glombitza J. Sandhoff K. Protein Sci... 1998; 7: 1039-1045Google Scholar). SAP-B was isolated from the spleen of a patient with Gaucher disease (3Klein A. Henseler M. Klein C. Suzuki K. Harzer K. Sandhoff K. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1994; 200: 1440-1447Google Scholar). The purity and identity of the final preparation was ensured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared by the following procedure: PC (50 mm, toluol/ethanol 2:1), BMP (5 mm, chloroform/methanol 2:1), PI (2.5 mm, chloroform), Chol (25.6 mm, chloroform/methanol 2:1), dolichol (2 mm, chloroform), DoP (0.75 mm, chloroform), PA (1.8 mm, chloroform/ethanol 1:1), and 3H-labeled GM2 (0.5 mm, toluol/ethanol 1:1) were dissolved in organic solvents. Appropriate aliquots of the lipid solutions were mixed and dried under nitrogen. The lipid mixture was hydrated to a total lipid concentration of 2 mm in Tris/HCl buffer (1 mm, pH 7.4) and freeze-thawed ten times in liquid nitrogen to ensure solute equilibration between trapped and bulk solutions. Unilamellar vesicles were prepared by passage through two polycarbonate filters (pore size, 100 nm; Avestin) mounted in tandem in a mini-extruder (Liposo-Fast; Avestin). Samples were subjected to 19 passes as recommended (22MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P.M. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1991; 1061: 297-303Google Scholar). Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were produced by sonification of LUVs with a Microtip sonicator (Branson, Danbury, CT) at 0 °C for 40 min (intervals of 15-s sonification, 30-s pause) under a stream of argon to minimize oxidation of lipids. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The liposomes used for the MUG assays were prepared as described above, but without the addition of GM2. Liposomes used for the surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy were prepared as described above, but hydrated to a lipid concentration of 0.5 mm in PBS buffer (10 mm phosphate, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, pH 7.4). Liposomes used for surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy contained unlabeled GM2. Concentrations of liposomal lipid (LUVs and SUVs) were determined by measurement of the radioactively labeled GM2. For liposomes that did not contain radioactive GM2 but were prepared by the same protocol, identical concentrations were assumed. Enzyme assays using MUG as substrate contained the following components in a final volume of 200 μl: sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.2, 50 mm), MUG (2 mm), unilamellar liposomes (LUVs, 1 mm , amount of total liposomal lipids) composed of 20 mol % Chol and 80 mol % PC or 20 mol % Chol, 60 mol % PC, and 20 mol % PA. Enzyme assays were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Incubations were stopped by adding 1 ml of sodium carbonate/glycine buffer (pH 9.5, 200 mm each). After vigorous shaking the amount of liberated 4-methylumbelliferone was measured fluorometrically. The standard incubation mixture using GM2 as substrate contained the following components in a final volume of 50 μl: bovine serum albumin (50 μg/ml), sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.2, 50 mm), unilamellar liposomes (LUVs or SUVs, total lipid concentration = 1 mm), GM2AP (0.08–2 μg), and β-hexosaminidase A (15 milliunits). Liposomes had the following composition: [3H]GM2 (10 mol %, 1.8 Ci/mol), Chol (20 mol %), PC (50–80 mol %), and BMP (0–25 mol %), dolichol (0–10 mol %), DoP (0–10 mol %), PI (0–30 mol %), or PA (0–25 mol %) as indicated in the legends to all of figures. The standard incubation conditions were 37 °C for 30 min. Enzyme assays were stopped by the addition of 50 μl of methanol. Terminated enzyme assays were loaded onto a reverse phasecolumn (RP18, 1 ml) equilibrated with a solution of chloroform/methanol/0.1 m KCl (3:48:47, v/v/v). The column was eluted with 2 ml of the same solvent, and the radioactivity in the effluents was measured in a scintillation counter. Biomolecular interaction analysis (surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy) was carried out at 25 °C with a Bialite instrument (Biacore). Sensorchips providing a preimmobilized surface with lipophilic anchors attached to a dextran matrix (Pioneer L1 chip) were obtained from Biacore. LUVs (total lipid concentration = 0.5 mm), diluted in PBS buffer, were injected into the system at a flow rate of 5 μl/min in two steps (first injection, 60 μl; second injection, 40 μl). This resulted in a RU shift of 5000–7000 RU. 10 μl sodium hydroxide (25 mm) were then injected at 100 μl/min to remove multilamellar structures and to stabilize the base line, resulting in a RU shift of about 20–50 RU. GM2AP (0.2 μm) in running buffer (50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.2) was injected into the flow cells at a rate of 20 μl/min. All data are means of at least duplicate determinations. All individual values are in the range of ±5% up to ±15% of the mean. To investigate the influence of acidic lipids on the rate of GM2 degradation under lysosome-like conditions, GM2 was incorporated into liposomes and incubated with HexA and GM2AP. In a series of preliminary experiments the influence of pH, time, and substrate concentration on GM2 degradation was investigated. Optimal degradation rates were obtained at pH 4.2 for ganglioside GM2 and at pH 4.5 for the artificial substrate MUG (data not shown). It was found that the rate of degradation was linear for up to 30 min using liposomes containing 10 mol % [3H]GM2 and 20 mol % PA (data not shown). Experiments with increasing amounts of [3H]GM2 (0–10 mol %) in liposomes containing 20 mol % PA resulted in an almost linear dependence of the degradation rate on substrate concentration (data not shown). Studies using the water-soluble synthetic substrate MUG showed no influence of GM2AP on the degradation rate. The hydrolysis was also not affected by the presence of liposomes containing 20 mol % PA or by the presence of both, GM2AP and the anionic lipid (data not shown). BMP is a unique, anionic lysophospholipid found specifically in the lysosomes (23Wherett J.R. Huterer S. J. Biol. Chem... 1972; 247: 4114-4120Google Scholar, 24Stremmel W. Debuch H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z.

Nature.. 1998; 392: 193-197Google Scholar). It may play a role in destabilizing these structures, thus facilitating the degradation of their components by lysosomal hydrolases. To determine the influence of BMP on the degradation of GM2, we tested how increasing concentrations of GM2AP affected the GM2 degradation rate in liposomes containing differing amounts of BMP (Fig.1). This experiment demonstrated that GM2 hydrolysis requires the presence of GM2AP. Increasing amounts of BMP stimulated GM2 degradation in the presence of GM2AP, but not in its absence, whereas maximum stimulation of GM2 degradation was achieved by 0.5–1 μm GM2AP. We also tested how increasing amounts of BMP stimulate the GM2 degradation. LUVs containing 10 mol % [3H]GM2 were spiked with increasing amounts of BMP and incubated with 15 milliunits of HexA in the presence of 0.5 μm GM2AP. Under these conditions, the incorporation of 25 mol % BMP into liposomes increased the GM2 degradation rate 180-fold compared with BMP-free liposomes (Fig.2 A).Figure 2Lysosomal lipids in LUVs stimulate the enzymatic hydrolysis of ganglioside GM2 in the presence of GM2AP. All assays were conducted with ganglioside GM2-carrying LUVs as substrates in the absence (■) and presence (▪) of GM2AP (0.5 μm) as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using LUVs with various proportions of synthetic BMP (0–25 mol %) (A) or PI (0–30 mol %) (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test the influence of the membrane curvature on the rate of degradation, SUVs were doped with increasing amounts of BMP and subjected to HexA and GM2AP. They displayed GM2 degradation rates that ranged about 40% above those measured for LUVs (data not shown). In a study by Wu and co-workers (27Wu Y.Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugimaya E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 16276-16283Google Scholar), it was shown that the GM2AP-dependent degradation of micellar GM2 is increased by the additional presence of SAP-B in high concentrations (40-fold excess over GM2AP). The authors conclude that SAP-B might play a role in the degradation of GM2 in vivo. To test this hypothesis in our detergent-free assay system, we prepared LUVs containing 10 mol % [3H]GM2 and either 70 mol % PC and 20 mol % Chol or 45 mol % PC, 20 mol % Chol, and 25 mol % BMP. GM2-containing LUVs were incubated with HexA in the presence of either SAP-B, GM2AP, or a mixture of the two activator proteins, using a 2-fold excess of SAP-B over GM2AP. In the absence of BMP, minimal GM2 degradation was detected in the presence of GM2AP and in the mixture of GM2AP and SAP-B, whereas no degradation took place in the presence of SAP-B alone, as expected (Fig. 3). Using BMP-containing liposomes, high degradation rates were detected in the presence of GM2AP. This, however, was not the case when SAP-B was used as activator protein (which, again, was expected), and no additional increase in the degradation rate was observed when SAP-B was added to GM2AP-containing incubation mixtures. Since we do not observe an effect of SAP-B on the GM2AP-dependent degradation of GM2 in our liposomal system using similar amounts of SAP-B and GM2AP, we conclude that the effect observed in the micellar system by Wu and co-workers (27Wu Y.Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugimaya E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 16276-16283Google Scholar) does probably not play a role under physiological conditions. Not only BMP, but also the negatively charged phospholipid PI, has been found in lysosomes in relatively high concentrations (15Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerlose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature.. 1998; 392: 193-197Google Scholar, 23Wherett J.R. Huterer S. J. Biol. Chem... 1972; 247: 4114-4120Google Scholar, 24Stremmel W. Debuch H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol.

Dolichol is a polyisoprenoide and one of the largest lipids occurring in mammalian cells. It consists of an α-saturated isoprene unit and occurs either as a free alcohol or in its phosphorylated form as DoP. Both, dolichol and DoP, were found to occur in lysosomes in high concentrations compared with other organelles (18Cojnacki T. Dallner G. Biochem. J... 1988; 251: 1-9Google Scholar). GD1a is a negatively charged glycosphingolipid, the degradation of which takes place in the lysosomes. To investigate whether the stimulation of GM2 degradation by BMP is an unspecific effect of negatively charged lipids or of lipids that destabilize membranes such as dolichol (18Cojnacki T. Dallner G. Biochem. J... 1988; 251: 1-9Google Scholar), the effect of these lipids on the degradation of liposomal GM2 was determined. Liposomes containing 10 mol % [3H]GM2 and increasing amounts of one of these four lipids were incubated with HexA either in the presence or in the absence of GM2AP. Neither dolichol nor GD1a or dolichol phosphate showed a significant stimulatory effect on GM2 degradation. Degradation rates were in the range of the measuring accuracy for all concentrations measured (0–2 nmol/h U) (data not shown). However, a pronounced stimulation was detected in the presence of PI and GM2AP (Fig. 2 B). A concentration of 30 mol % PI in the liposomes stimulated the degradation of membrane-bound GM2 150-fold. To analyze how GM2AP interacts with lipid bilayers, surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed. The effect of the presence of GM2 and acidic phospholipids in the lipid bilayers was studied in detail. In the first set of experiments, liposomes composed of neutral lipids and rising concentrations of GM2 were immobilized on a Pioneer L1 chip. The strongest binding of GM2AP to the immobilized lipid bilayer was observed when the membrane structures did not contain GM2 (Fig. 4 A). Unexpectedly, the binding signal progressively decreased with rising amounts of GM2. In the second set of experiments, 20 mol % of BMP were incorporated into the bilayers together with rising amounts of GM2 (Fig. 4 B). Binding curves followed a similar pattern as observed for lipid bilayers without BMP, although the binding signals were somewhat reduced. The most notable effect of the presence of BMP was a dramatic drop of the binding signal shortly after GM2AP injection. This drop was most pronounced for membrane structures containing high amounts of GM2. In all bilayers containing GM2 and BMP, the signal dropped below the initial base-line value after about 360 s, reaching a minimum of −800 RU in the presence of 20 mol % GM2 (Fig. 4 B). To exclude the possibility that the effect observed for GM2AP is nonspecific, we studied the binding of bovine serum albumin and SAP-B to lipid bilayers containing BMP and GM2. Bovine serum albumin tethers very strongly (11,300 RU), whereas SAP-B binds weaker than GM2AP (250 RU). The binding curves follow a similar pattern as observed for lipid bilayers composed of neutral lipids and GM2 and show no dramatic drop of the binding signal as observed in the presence of BMP and GM2AP (data not shown). Since the binding of GM2AP to gangliosides had been reported not to be completely specific for GM2 (5Meier E.M. Schwarzmann G. Fürst W. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 1879-1887Google Scholar, 28Conzelmann E. Burg J. Stephan G. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem... 1982; 123: 455-464Google Scholar), we decided to analyze whether a similar effect as that observed for GM2 was also observed for other glycolipids. To do this, we investigated the binding of GM2AP to lipid bilayers containing 10 mol % GM1, glucosylceramide, or GM3, all spiked with 10 mol % BMP, by surface plasmon resonance. The binding curve for GM3 showed a similar pattern as that observed for lipid bilayers doped with 10 mol % BMP only (Fig. 5). The same was true for glucosylceramide, although the total binding signal was reduced (data not shown). The binding curve of GM2AP to GM1, however, is comparable with the one observed for GM2, including the strong drop in the signal upon injection of the activator protein (Fig.5). These results indicate that GM2AP differentiates between different glycolipids but is not completely specific for GM2, which is in accordance with earlier results (5Meier E.M. Schwarzmann G. Fürst W. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 1879-1887Google Scholar, 28Conzelmann E. Burg J. Stephan G. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem... 1982; 123: 455-464Google Scholar). The observed drop in the plasmon resonance signal suggests that GM2AP can either extract lipids from immobilized lipid bilayers containing BMP and GM2 or GM1 or lead to a destabilization of the bilayers with concomitant loss of lipids. GSLs are amphiphilic components of the plasma membrane of eucaryotic cells. After endocytosis, GSLs reach the lysosomal compartments of the cells where they are catabolized by a series of lysosomal glycosidases. According to our recent model of endocytosis and lysosomal digestion (1Sandhoff K. Kolter T. Trends Cell Biol... 1996; 6: 98-103Google Scholar, 2Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1992; 1126: 1-16Google Scholar), GSLs are degraded as components of intraendosomal and intralysosomal membrane structures, rather than as components of the limiting lysosomal membrane. Such intralysosomal vesicles with a diameter in the range of 50–100 nm were detected in the biopsy tissue of a patient with prosaposin deficiency (29Bradová V. Smı́d F. Ulrich B. Roggendorf W. Paton B.C. Harzer K. Hum. Genet... 1993; 92: 143-152Google Scholar). Several factors such as membrane curvature, membrane pressure, and lipid composition may make such vesicles more accessible for the lysosomal hydrolases than the limiting membrane. To test this hypothesis, we studied the enzymatic hydrolysis of GM2, which requires lysosomal HexA and GM2AP as a cofactor (30Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. Hoppe Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem... 1979; 360: 1837-1849Google Scholar, 31Wu Y.Y. Sonnino S. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 10611-10615Google Scholar, 32Burg J. Banerjee A. Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem... 1983; 364: 821-829Google Scholar) in a detergent-free assay system mimicking the intralysosomal conditions. The studies were performed at pH 4.2, which is optimal for the enzymatic reaction and typical for the lysosomal content (33Ohkuma S. Poole B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1978; 75: 3327-33331Google Scholar). The substrate was presented to the HexA as a component of liposomal membranes, either of LUVs with an average diameter of 100 nm or of SUVs with an average diameter of 40 nm. Liposomes were composed of lipids that had been detected in the acidic compartment of the cell or had been specifically localized to its inner membranes as BMP. In contrast to the presentation of the substrate as micelles, this is believed to be the most appropriate model for the lysosomal digestion of membrane-bound GSL substrates. The incorporation of acidic lipids occurring in lysosomes such as BMP or PI into the liposomes led to a strong stimulation of the degradation of GM2 in the presence of GM2AP (up to 180-fold at 25 mol % BMP). A significant enzymatic degradation of GM2 was only observed in the presence of both, an anionic lipid and the GM2AP. Although the concentrations of acidic lipids used in this study are quite high, they can still be considered to be in a realistic physiological range. The determination of lipid concentrations in cellular organelles is difficult, and results vary considerably with the cells and the method of organelle isolation used. Nevertheless, several investigations found increased amounts of BMP and PI in lysosomes. The relative amounts of BMP in lysosomes that were reported vary between 7 mol % (23Wherett J.R. Huterer S. J. Biol. Chem... 1972; 247: 4114-4120Google Scholar) and 28 mol % (24Stremmel W. Debuch H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem... 1976; 357: 803-810Google Scholar), but most reports state values of more than 10 mol % of total lysosomal lipid. The corresponding values determined for PI are in the order of 5–10 mol % (25Bleistein J. Heidrich H.G. Debuch H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem... 1980; 361: 595-597Google Scholar). The determination of lipid concentrations on intraendosomal and intralysosomal membrane structures was not possible to date, so that a further enrichment of the lipids in these structures has to be considered. For BMP it has been demonstrated immunologically that it is localized specifically on intraendosomal membranes (15Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerlose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature.. 1998; 392: 193-197Google Scholar). Anionic lipids like PA, sulfatide, etc., which also stimulated GM2 hydrolysis in vitro, have not been detected in lysosomes and are therefore of no physiological significance. Other lipids that occur in the lysosomes such as dolichol, phosphatidylcholine, or dolichol phosphate did not have a similar stimulatory effect on the degradation of GM2 as it was observed for BMP and PI. Acidic gangliosides such as GD1a, which are degraded in the lysosomes and have been shown to disintegrate phospholipid bilayers at concentrations above 20 mol % (34Bertoli E. Masserini M. Sonnino S. Ghidoni R. Cestaro B. Tettamanti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1981; 647: 196-202Google Scholar), also showed no significant stimulatory effect at concentrations between 2.5 and 20 mol %. This demonstrates that the effect is not due to an unspecific destabilization of the membranes by anionic lipids. The fact that dolichol or its phosphate do not stimulate the reaction, although they are known to strongly destabilize membranes (18Cojnacki T. Dallner G. Biochem. J... 1988; 251: 1-9Google Scholar), implicates that a more complex mechanism than the simple perturbation of the membrane is the basis for the stimulatory effect of BMP and PI. A direct interaction of the acidic lipids with the degrading enzyme, as it has been proposed for the degradation of glucosylceramide by glucocerebrosidase and SAP-C (4Wilkening G. Linke T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 30271-30278Google Scholar), has to be ruled out though, since the degradation of the water-soluble synthetic substrate MUG is not affected by the presence of either GM2AP or liposomes containing acidic lipids. The specificity of the stimulatory effect of GM2AP on the reaction is high. An additional stimulation of the reaction by SAP-B, which was reported by Wu and co-workers for micellar GM2 (27Wu Y.Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugimaya E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 16276-16283Google Scholar) was not reproduced in our liposomal system using similar concentrations of both activators. We therefore conclude that this effect is not physiologically significant. To find out more about the mechanism by which BMP stimulates the lysosomal degradation of GM2, the binding of GM2AP to immobilized lipid bilayers was studied by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Our Biacore studies demonstrate that at pH 4.2 GM2AP binds to neutral lipid bilayers composed of PC and Chol as well as to anionic bilayers, which in addition contain GM2 and/or BMP. At pH 7, the binding of GM2AP to all liposomes tested was much weaker. However, the presence of BMP in the membrane structures did not lead to an increase of GM2AP binding (at pH 4.2) but to a significant drop of the resonance signal even below the base line (Fig. 4 B). This effect was not observed in the absence of BMP and indicates a solubilization of lipids from the membranes in the presence of both, BMP and GM2AP, which increases with increasing ganglioside GM2 concentrations. This solubilization is also dependent on concentrations of GM2AP (Fig. 4 C). Other proteins (bovine serum albumin, SAP-B) also bind to the membrane, but do not lead to a significant drop of the resonance signal, which indicates that the effect observed is specific for GM2AP and is not caused by an unspecific replacement of lipid structures by protein. These observations suggest an interaction of GM2AP with BMP, which leads to destabilization of the membrane. To investigate the specificity of the observed effect for the ganglioside GM2, we used bilayers containing GM1, GM3, or glucosylceramide in the plasmon resonance measurements. Lipid bilayers containing GM3 or glucosylceramide showed a similar GM2AP binding curve as membranes devoid of ganglioside, whereas the GM2AP binding behavior is comparable for bilayers containing either GM1 or GM2, including the strong drop of the signal upon injection of GM2AP. This demonstrates that GM2AP shows some specificity but is not completely specific for GM2, which is in agreement with earlier glycolipid transfer studies using GM2AP (5Meier E.M. Schwarzmann G. Fürst W. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 1879-1887Google Scholar, 28Conzelmann E. Burg J. Stephan G. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem... 1982; 123: 455-464Google Scholar). An interesting point is that studies on the enzymatic degradation of GM1 led to the conclusion that the GM2AP, similar to SAP-B, stimulates this degradation step in the presence of BMP (35Wilkening G. Linke T. Uhlhorn-Dierks G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 35814-35819Google Scholar). Whether, therefore, the strong drop in the plasmon resonance signal, which was observed for GM1 and GM2, is due to the same effect that causes the activator function of GM2AP is still speculative, but an interesting point to consider. The BMP-induced stimulation of glycolipid degradation is a phenomenon that is not limited to GM2 and the GM2AP. Similar results were obtained for the degradation of glucosylceramide by glucocerebrosidase and SAP-C (4Wilkening G. Linke T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 30271-30278Google Scholar) and of GM1 by β-galactosidase and SAP-B or GM2AP (35Wilkening G. Linke T. Uhlhorn-Dierks G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 35814-35819Google Scholar). These results together with the data presented here strongly support our hypothesis that the lysosomal degradation of glycosphingolipids takes place on intralysosomal membrane structures rather than in the limiting lysosomal membrane. BMP and presumably PI as components of these structures may contribute to a selective destabilization of such membrane structures, whereas the BMP-free limiting lysosomal membrane (15Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerlose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature.. 1998; 392: 193-197Google Scholar) is not affected. The specific lipid composition of different membrane structures may therefore serve to differentiate between them, protecting the limiting lysosomal membrane from digestion on one hand and marking the components of intralysosomal membranes for degradation on the other.

The basal activity of such G-protein signaling systems varies among cell types and at different stages of development. Several factors influence the basal activity of these systems, including constitutively active receptors and the type or amount of G-proteins and downstream signaling molecules expressed in the cell as well as proteins that directly influence the activation state of G-protein independent of G-protein-coupled receptors. Such receptor-independent regulators of G-protein activity include RGS proteins, caveolins, GAP43, and AGS proteins (1Sato M. Ribas C. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

Thus, AGS3 may function as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor for Gαi proteins and/or serve as a binding partner for Gαi independent of Gβγ. AGS3 (650 amino acids) is encoded by an ∼4-kb1 mRNA enriched in brain (6Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

The amino-terminal half of the protein contains seven tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), whereas the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein contains four G-protein regulatory (GPR) motifs, 2The GPR motif was also termed the GoLoco motif (11Siderovski D.P. Diverse-Pierlussi M.A. De Vries L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 340-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). each of which is capable of interacting with Gαi. As part of a continuing effort to understand the overall role of AGS3 and related proteins in G-protein function, we defined the tissue distribution of AGS3 mRNA. RNA blot analysis actually revealed two major transcripts of ∼2 and ∼4 kb that were selectively enriched in heart and brain. Further analysis of the AGS3 mRNA species indicated that the two transcripts potentially encoded related but distinct AGS3 proteins. We report the identification of a short form of AGS3 (AGS3-SHORT, 166 amino acids) that is encoded by the ∼2-kb heart-enriched mRNA. AGS3-SHORT lacks the TPR domains found in AGS3-LONG, but contains three complete GPR motifs and a portion of the fourth GPR motif found in AGS-LONG. GST-AGS3-SHORT selectively interacted with G-proteins in heart cell lysates and inhibited nucleotide exchange on purified Gαi2. Immunofluorescent imaging of mammalian cells transiently expressing AGS3-SHORT or AGS3-LONG indicated distinct locations of the two forms of AGS3 within the cell. AGS3 thus exists as short and long forms that differ in their tissue distribution and trafficking within the cell. [32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

After four and two rounds of amplification with nested primers for the dC-tailed cDNA (kit from Life Technologies, Inc.) and Marathon-Ready cDNA, respectively, the amplified products were electrophoresed on agarose gels, and membrane transfers were hybridized with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (nt 1421 in the protein coding region of AGS3-LONG, 5′-CCCCGTCCTCTGACGAGGAGTGTTTCTTCGATCTG-3′). Positive DNA fragments were eluted from the gel and subcloned into the TA cloning vector pCR-TOPO (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Bacterial colonies obtained from these transformants were again screened by hybridization with the same AGS3 oligonucleotide. Plasmids from positive colonies were purified, and the nucleotide sequence of the insert was determined in the DNA Sequencing Facility at the Medical University of South Carolina. Tissue and cellular mRNAs were isolated as described above. Riboprobes were labeled with [32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), and RNase protection assays were performed using the Ambion series of pre-made reagents as described (15Saulnier-Blache J.S. Yang Q. Sherlock J.D. Lanier S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1432-1442PubMed Google Scholar). RNA probes were generated from fragments of AGS3-SHORT cDNAs that spanned the region of sequence divergence from AGS3-LONG, thus allowing the detection of both AGS3-LONG and AGS3-SHORT transcripts in the same sample simply based upon size differences. To generate constructs for probe generation, an AGS3-SHORT-1 cDNA obtained by 5′-RACE was isolated from pCR-TOPO by restriction with NaeI and EcoRI and subcloned into the EcoRI andSmaI sites of pBluescript SK. For AGS3-SHORT-2, the longest cDNA isolated by library screening was restricted withEcoRI and SmaI and subcloned into theEcoRI and SmaI sites of pSK.Bluescript. The vectors were linearized by XhoI, and 32P-labeled antisense riboprobes were made using T3 RNA polymerase. 1 μg of heart or brain mRNA or 0.5 μg of CHO total RNA was hybridized with probe for 12 h at 45 °C, followed by RNase A/RNase T1 digestion. Protected fragments were separated on an 8 murea and 5% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by exposure to X-Omat film at −90 °C for 12–24 h. The respective insert and probe lengths for AGS3-SHORT-1 were 357 and 447 nt. The respective insert and probe lengths for AGS3-SHORT-2 were 230 and 319 nt. The sizes of the protected fragments resulting from annealing the AGS3-SHORT-1 and AGS3-SHORT-2 probes with AGS3-LONG would be 228 and 184 nt, respectively. CHO and COS-7 cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and Fungizone (0.25 μg/ml). For transient expression, CHO and COS-7 cells at 70–80% confluency (100-mm dish) were transfected with 10 μg of AGS3-LONG or AGS3-SHORT cDNA using 30 μl of LipofectAMINE. Cells were harvested after 48 h and resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl, 0.2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) with a 26 38 gauge syringe. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C to generate a crude membrane pellet and a 100,000 × g supernatant that represents the cytosol. The crude membrane pellet was washed once with 4 volumes of membrane buffer. Rat heart or brain tissue was homogenized in lysis buffer using a Powergen 125 tissue disruptor (Fisher), followed by Dounce homogenization. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant from this spin was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to generate a crude membrane pellet and a 100,000 ×g supernatant that represents the cytosol. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay. Aliquots of samples were added to Laemmli sample buffer and placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min prior to processing by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting as previously described (6Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Three AGS3 peptides (PEP22 (Asp528–Gly550), PEP98 (Val625–Ser650), and PEP32 (Thr407—Ile436)) from different areas of AGS3-LONG were synthesized and conjugated for generation of rabbit polyclonal antisera in the Peptide Synthesis and Antibody Production Facility at the Medical University of South Carolina. Each of the antisera was affinity-purified prior to use. CHO and COS-7 cells were plated onto coverslips (18-mm round no. 1) precoated with 0.01% polylysine and transfected with AGS3-SHORT-1, AGS3-LONG, or AGS3-TPR in pcDNA3. The AGS3-TPR construct consisted of the first 454 amino acids of AGS3-LONG. AGS3-TPR was generated by PCR using primers 5′-GGGGATCCATGGAGGCCTCCTGTCTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAATTCTTTAATCAGCACTGTCCAGTG-3′ (reverse), in which amino acid codon 455 of AGS3-LONG was mutated to a stop codon. 48 h after transfection, cells were briefly washed with cell washing solution (CWS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, and 10 mmNa2HPO4) and fixed for 5 min in CWS containing 3% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were rinsed with CWS (3 × 3 ml/coverslip) and incubated with 25 mm NH4Cl in CWS for 10 min to quench free aldehyde groups. Fixed cells were incubated with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature and washed twice with CWS (3 ml/coverslip). The coverslips were then incubated with CWS containing 1% fetal bovine serum for 30 min at 24 °C, followed by incubation with a 1:100 dilution of affinity-purified AGS3 PEP22, PEP32, or PEP98 antibody in CWS for 14 h at 4 °C. Coverslips were washed three times with CWS (3 ml/coverslip) and incubated with secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody, 5 μg/ml) for 60 min at 24 °C. Coverslips were washed three times (3 ml/coverslip) and mounted with Slow-Fade anti-fade reagent (ICN). A Leica DMLB fluorescence microscope and an Olympus confocal fluorescence microscope (FV5-PSU laser, BX50) were used for immunofluorescent microscopy. The cell nucleus was identified by propidium iodide staining. Multiple series of experiments (different fixation procedures, incubation times, and amounts of antibody) were performed to determine the optimal conditions for signal detection and to verify the specificity of observed signals. No immunofluorescent signal was detected in control cells transfected with the pcDNA3 control vector or in the absence of primary antibody. Each field of cells evaluated by microscopy contained both transfected and non-transfected cells, providing additional internal controls for observed signals. The binding of AGS3-SHORT to G-proteins was assessed by protein interaction experiments using both rat heart lysates and purified Gαi2. The AGS3-SHORT sequence encoding the Mr ∼ 23,000 peptide was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and fused in frame to glutathione S-transferase in the pGEX-4T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The GST-AGS3-SHORT fusion protein was expressed in bacteria (Escherichia coli BL21, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified on a glutathione affinity matrix. The AGS3-SHORT fusion protein was eluted from the resin, and glutathione was removed by desalting as previously described (14Wu G. Hildebrandt J. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7197-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) to allow a solution-phase interaction assay. Rat heart lysates were prepared by Dounce homogenization in buffer (5 ml/heart) containing 50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenates were gently rotated for 1 h on ice at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants were collected and spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min to generate a detergent-soluble fraction. For protein interaction studies with purified G-protein, GST or GST-AGS3-SHORT-1 fusion proteins (300 nm) were incubated with 100 nm Gαi2 (preincubated with 10 μm GDP or GTPγS and 10 mm MgCl2for 10 min at 4 °C) in 250 μl of incubation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.6 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 70 mm NaCl, 0.01% Lubrol, 10 μm GDP or GTPγS, and 10 mmMgCl2) for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. 30 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose was added, and incubation was continued at 4 °C for 40 min. Samples were then centrifuged, and the matrix was washed with 3 × 250 μl of incubation buffer prior to solubilization in Laemmli sample buffer. For interaction assays with tissue lysates, GST-AGS3-SHORT (5 μg) was incubated with 1–2 mg of lysate protein in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μm GDP for 12 h at 4 °C in a total volume of 250 μl. 25 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose was added, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 40 min, after which the affinity matrix was pelleted and washed three times with 500 μl of incubation buffer. Proteins retained on the matrix were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer. Solubilized samples were electrophoresed on denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblotting with Gα antisera. For reprobing of membranes, the membrane transfers were washed with immunoblot buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween and then incubated with preheated stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 20 min in a 55 °C water bath with gentle shaking. The membrane was washed with immunoblot buffer and processed for immunoblotting. Each blot was also incubated with AGS3 antisera and stained with Amido Black to provide internal controls for protein loading. GTPγS binding assays were generally conducted as described (8Bernard M.

Graber S.G. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33193-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). G-proteins (100 nm) were preincubated for 20 min at 24 °C in the presence and absence of increasing concentrations of GST or GST-AGS3-SHORT. Reactions were initiated by addition of 0.5 μm [35S]GTPγS (4 × 104dpm/pmol), and incubations (total volume of 50 μl) were continued for 30 min at 24 °C. Both preincubations and GTPγS binding assays were conducted in binding buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 μm adenosine triphosphate, and 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration through nitrocellulose filters with 3 × 4 ml of stop buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) at 4 °C. Radioactivity bound to the filters was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Nonspecific binding was defined with 100 μm GTPγS. AGS3 was initially defined as a 650-amino acid protein encoded by an ∼4-kb cDNA (6Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To determine the tissue distribution of the AGS3 mRNA, we performed mRNA blot analysis with two probes derived from the upstream and downstream regions of the ∼4-kb mRNA coding region (Fig.1 A). Both probes identified an ∼4-kb mRNA enriched in brain (Fig. 1 B). The 3′-probe identified an additional ∼2-kb mRNA enriched in heart (Fig. 1,B and C). The ∼2-kb mRNA was also identified with hybridization probes derived from the 3′-UTR of the ∼4-kb cDNA. 3N. Pizzinat and S. M. Lanier, unpublished observations. The relative expression of the ∼4- and ∼2-kb AGS3 mRNAs in heart was developmentally regulated. In rat heart, the ∼4-kb mRNA was enriched at birth, whereas the ∼2-kb mRNA predominated in the adult rat (Fig. 1 C). Within the adult rat heart, the ∼2-kb mRNA was clearly enriched in ventricular tissue. Although a full-length human AGS3 cDNA is not available, we obtained a partial human AGS3 expressed sequence tag clone and used this sequence to perform a similar RNA blot analysis in human tissue (Fig.2). The human AGS3 probe (344 nt) corresponded to the same region of AGS3 used to generate PROBE B in Fig. 1 and thus would detect both AGS3-SHORT and AGS3-LONG. In human, as in rat, there were two AGS3 transcripts of ∼2 and 4 kb that were differentially enriched in heart and brain (Fig. 2). As in rat heart, the ∼4-kb AGS3 mRNA in human heart predominated at birth, whereas both mRNAs were expressed in the adult heart (Fig.2). The ∼4-kb mRNA and its encoded protein were termed AGS3-LONG, whereas the ∼2-kb mRNA was termed AGS3-SHORT, and we initiated experiments to define the smaller mRNA and its encoded protein.Figure 2Tissue distribution of human AGS3 mRNA. CLONTECH multiple-human tissue and cardiovascular system blots containing 2 μg of poly(A)+RNA/lane were hybridized with a 344-nt probe generated from a partial human AGS3 cDNA (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AI272212; 2117 nt). The 344-nt probe corresponded to same region of AGS3 used to generate PROBE B in Fig. 1 and thus would detect both AGS3-SHORT and AGS3-LONG.

The regulated expression of PKK in mouse embryos is consistent with a role for this kinase in early embryogenesis. The human homolog of PKK has over 90% identity to its murine counterpart, has been localized to chromosome 21q22.3, and is identical to the PKCδ-interacting kinase, DIK (Bahr, C., Rohwer, A., Stempka, L., Rincke, G., Marks, F., and Gschwendt, M.

PKK exhibits protein kinase activity in vitro and associates with cellular membranes. PKK exists in three discernible forms at steady state: an underphosphorylated form of 100 kDa; a soluble, cytosolic, phosphorylated form of 110 kDa; and a phosphorylated, detergent-insoluble form of 112 kDa. PKK is initially synthesized as an underphosphorylated soluble 100-kDa protein that is quantitatively converted to a detergent-soluble 110-kDa form. This conversion requires an active catalytic domain. Although PKK physically associates with PKCβ, it does not phosphorylate this PKC isoform. However, PKK itself may be phosphorylated by PKCβ. PKK represents a developmentally regulated protein kinase that can associate with membranes.

AF302127 protein kinase C PKC-associated kinase glutathioneS-transferase days post coitum phosphate-buffered saline mitogen-activated protein Isl-1, and Mec-3 The protein kinase C (PKC)1 family is made up of at least 11 phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases (1Nishizuka Y.

PKC was originally described as a calcium-activated, phospholipid-dependent cytosolic serine/threonine kinase. Conventional PKCs include PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCγ. They require phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol, and Ca2+for maximal activation. PKC subfamilies exist which either do not require calcium (novel PKCs) or which require neither calcium nor diacylglycerol for optimal activation (atypical PKCs). Specific PKC isozymes play important and distinct roles in the development and activation of most vertebrate cell types including lymphocytes, but the study of the function of individual isozymes is in its infancy. PKCβI and PKCβII are generated by alternative splicing at the PKCβ locus and differ over a 50–52-amino acid stretch at their C termini. This locus has been shown to be critical for the generation of B-1 B lymphocytes and for the activation of peripheral B cells by T-independent antigens (5Leitges M. Schmedt C. Guinamard R. Davoust J. Schaal S. Stabel S. Tarakhovsky A. Science. 1996; 273: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). PKCβ has also been shown to be required in HL-60 cells for phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced differentiation into macrophages (6Tonetti D.A. Henning-Chubb C. Yamanishi D.T. Huberman E. J. Biol.

Although a number of proteins that are phosphorylated by PKCβ have been described, the substrate(s) of PKCβ critical for B cell development remains to be identified. We describe here a novel protein kinase that can physically associate with PKCβ. We show that this novel ankyrin repeat-containing kinase, which we call PKK (for PKC-associated kinase), is associated with membranes, is initially synthesized as a soluble 100-kDa protein, and is subsequently converted to a larger phosphorylated form. This conversion depends, at least in part, on the intrinsic catalytic activity of this kinase. At steady state, a portion of this protein is membrane-associated. The significance of the association of PKK with PKCβ remains to be determined. HA-tagged PKCβI, PKCα, and PKCδ plasmids were generous gifts from Dr. Shun'ichi Kuroda (10Kuroda S. Tokunaga C.

The kinase domains of PKCβI (residues 291–673), PKCβII (residues 291–673), and PKCδ (residues 343–674) were used as baits in a yeast two-hybrid approach and were individually cloned into the SalI/SpeI sites of pPC97AD (Life Technologies, Inc.; kindly provided by Dr. Marc Vidal, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). A kinase dead PKK K51R mutant, was created using polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing. In-frame glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion constructs involving distinct fragments of PKK were generated using pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed as described (18Vidal M. Brachmann R.K. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 19: 10315-10320Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar). A pPC86DB-cDNA library was made with 12–13-day whole murine fetuses (gift of Dr. Joshua LaBaer, Harvard Medical School). The expression of bait plasmids was confirmed by Western blotting using individual isotype-specific antibodies. For library screening, the yeast MaV103 strain carrying the pPC97AD-PKCβ1-(291–673) plasmid was transformed with the pPC86DB cDNA library. Transformants were replica-plated onto different selective plates as described (18Vidal M. Brachmann R.K. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both strands of a 3.4-kilobase pair full-length cDNA clone obtained from the two-hybrid assay were sequenced, and this insert was cloned into a pCMV-driven expression vector with a Flag tag. Whole mount in situhybridization on 8.5–10.5-day post coitum (dpc) WB mouse embryos was carried out as described (19Wilkinson D.G. Nieto M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). In situhybridization on frozen sections of paraformaldehyde-fixed mouse embryonic tissues with digoxigenin-labeled antisense probes was carried out essentially as described by Ma et al. (20Ma Q. Sommer L. Cserjesi P. Anderson D.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3644-3652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Photomicrographs of whole mount embryos or sections following in situ hybridization or immunolabeling were collected on an Olympus SZH10 stereo dissecting microscope or Nikon E600 compound microscope fitted with a SPOT I digital camera (Diagnostic Imaging). Digoxigenin-labeled PKK,PKCβI, and PKCβIIprobes were used in these studies. 293T cells were transiently transfected with different plasmid constructs using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described (21Kranenburg O. Scharnhorst V. Van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Harvested cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation, and the cell lysates were incubated for 30 min on ice with either 3 μg of anti-Flag (M2, Eastman Kodak Co.) or anti-HA (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) monoclonal antibody followed by incubation with 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow (50% slurry, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (see below). Half of the beads were reserved for Western blotting. The other half of each sample was used in an in vitro kinase assay. Beads were suspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 8 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 0.8 μg/ml diolein (Sigma). After the addition of 1.0 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml), the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS loading buffer. Samples were analyzed on an 8% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. The gel was dried, and proteins were visualized by autoradiography. GST fusion proteins were isolated from BL21 cells transformed with GST fusion expression plasmids according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, bacteria were initially grown at 37 °C for about 2–3 h (A 600 = 0.5–0.8) and subsequently induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–4 h. Cells were sonicated, and the fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified GST fusion proteins were dialyzed in kinase buffer or PBS (for the binding assay), respectively, and protein concentrations were measured. GST fusion proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-GST antibodies. For the phosphorylation assay, 1 μg of each purified fusion protein was used as substrate for purified PKCβ1(Calbiochem) in 40 μl of the kinase buffer (described above). 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS loading buffer; samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were visualized by autoradiography. 293T or COS cells grown on coverslips and transfected with Flag-tagged PKK constructs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 in PBS, and stained with anti-Flag antibody followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. In separate experiments, transfected cells were washed in PBS and were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were ruptured by repeated passage through a 27-gauge needle. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 700 ×g for 10 min. Membranes were isolated from the post-nuclear supernatant by centrifugation at 75,000 rpm for 15 min on a Beckman TL-100 Ultracentrifuge. The pellet (membranes) was taken up in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, and Triton X-100 was also added to the supernatant (cytosol) to bring it to 1% (v/v). Transfected 293T cells were starved for 1 h in methionine-free medium and labeled with 0.1–0.5 mCi of [35S]-methionine for 10 min. Cells were either lysed immediately or chased for varying time periods with an excess of complete medium. Lysates were immunoprecipitated as described above. Phosphatase treatment of immunoprecipitates and membrane pellets was carried out using lambda protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs). Typically 400–1000 units of enzyme were used in a 100-μl suspension in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mmNa2EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmMnCl2, and 0.01% (v/v) Brij 35. Untreated and treated samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. A two-hybrid screen was initiated using the catalytic domain of PKCβI as a bait. Our initial goal was either to identify targets of PKCβ or to identify proteins that might regulate the activity of PKCβ. In particular we were aware that we might identify protein kinases, other than PDK1 (22Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar), required for the activation of PKCβ. The yeast strain used in this two-hybrid assay contains three stably integrated reporter constructs expressing HIS3, LacZ, and URA3. Clones were considered to have scored positively if they grew on plates lacking histidine and containing 3-AT, if they turned blue on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) plates, and if they grew on plates lacking uracil but failed to grow in 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), which is toxic if URA3 is expressed. 4 × 106 independent transformants from a mouse embryo library were screened using this stringent approach. Only one positive clone was obtained. Rescreening with specific baits revealed that the product of this clone interacted specifically with the catalytic domain of PKCβI but not with a number of other baits including the catalytic domain of PKCβII, the Rb-related p130 pocket protein, the cytoplasmic tail of CD44, or the DP1 subunit of E2F·DP complexes. We obtained a full-length clone from a murine embryonic cDNA library; the sequence of this cDNA is depicted in Fig.1 a.The PKK cDNA contains a 2358-base pair open reading frame with a presumptive initiator methionine at nucleotide 50, a TAG stop codon at nucleotide 2408, and an AAUAAA polyadenylation signal at nucleotide 3527, 11 base pairs upstream of the cleavage site. An in-frame stop codon was identified upstream of the first ATG codon. Preliminary analysis of the predicted protein sequence revealed a novel putative serine/threonine kinase with the kinase domain encompassing approximately the first 300 amino acids. A stretch of 11 ankyrin repeats was noted in the C-terminal half of the open reading frame starting at residue 442 (schematically represented in Fig.1 c). In vitro transcription and translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate yielded a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa (data not shown). Although no close homologs of this cDNA were noted when this manuscript was originally prepared for submission (see “Discussion”), an analysis of the 12 conserved kinase subdomains suggested that it encoded a novel protein kinase. The predicted protein encoded by this cDNA was called PKK (for PKC-associated kinase). An examination of subdomains VI and VII suggested that PKK represents a serine/threonine kinase with conservation of a DLKPAN motif and a DFG triplet (23Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3823) Google Scholar), but the possibility that it represents a dual specificity serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase was not excluded. The activation loop of PKK contains a Ser-X-X-X-Ser motif characteristically found in MAP kinase kinases (24Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), which are typically dual specificity kinases, and in related kinases such as IKK1 and IKK2 (25Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). Ten potential PKC phosphorylation sites, were noted and these are underlined in Fig. 1 a. A human PKK cDNA was obtained using the mouse insert as a probe. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of human/rodent radiation hybrids localized PKK to human chromosome 21. The sequence of human chromosome 21 was published while this manuscript was in preparation (26Hattori M. Fujiyama A. Taylor T.D. Watanabe H. Yada T. et al.Nature. 2000; 405: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), and we confirmed the localization of human PKK to chromosome 21q22.3. The complete sequence of human PKK was confirmed from the human chromosome 21 sequence data base (26Hattori M. Fujiyama A. Taylor T.D. Watanabe H. Yada T. et al.Nature. 2000; 405: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar).The mouse and human cDNAs encode almost identical proteins, but the mouse sequence includes two residues (Glu316 and Ser317) in the linker region between the kinase domain and the ankyrin repeats that were not predicted by the human sequence (Fig. 1 b).Figure 1PKK is a novel ankyrin repeat-containing kinase. a, nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of mouse PKK cDNA.

PKK is, however, relatively abundant in the thymus and is expressed in bone marrow in pro-B, pre-B, and immature B cells (data not shown). During embryogenesis, PKK mRNA transcripts were detected at 10.5 dpc at diverse locations including the embryonic forebrain, otic vesicle, branchial arches, primitive gut, and genitourinary system (Fig. 2 b). Expression ofPKCβI and PKCβII(Fig. 2, c and d) broadly mimicked that ofPKK in the primitive vessels and branchial arch primordium, although PKK and PKCβ expression only partially overlap during development. At 12.5 dpc, ongoing expression was detected in the gut, the mesonephric duct of the genitourinary tract, and the urogenital sinus. Interestingly, we noted transient expression of PKK in the ventral neural tube at 12.5 dpc (arrow, Fig. 2 e) but not at the earlier or later stages tested. By 14.5 dpc, strong expression throughout the gastrointestinal tract was observed in the luminal tissues of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and intestines (Fig. 2, f andg), as well as transient expression in the skin. In addition, PKK was expressed in the collecting system of the genitourinary tract but not in kidney. These results are consistent with the possibility that PKK has roles during embryonic development. In Fig. 3, we provide formal evidence that PKK is a protein kinase. In an immunoprecipitation kinase assay, autophosphorylation of PKK was observed, and this kinase also phosphorylates exogenous substrates such as myelin basic protein (data not shown) and histone H1 (Fig. 3). These findings do not rule out the possibility that an associated kinase (such as PKCβ) may mediate some of these activities. However, the PKK K51R mutant (kinase dead PKK) has limited immunoprecipitation kinase activity, indicating that PKK is indeed a kinase (Fig. 3). PKK is frequently visualized in transfected cells as a doublet in the 100–110 kDa range (see Figs.Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). The relationship between some of the different forms of this protein has been established and is described below (see Figs. 6 and 7).Figure 6PKK exists in multiple underphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms. a, COS cells were transfected with Flag-tagged wild type PKK, and permeabilized cells were stained with anti-Flag monoclonal antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti mouse IgG. b, subcellular fractionation of 293T cells expressing wild type PKK. Cytosol was obtained from the post-nuclear supernatant of disrupted cells by ultracentrifugation. Membranes were extracted (TSM, Triton-soluble membranes) with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The remaining pellet was solubilized using SDS sample buffer (TIM, Triton-insoluble membranes). 4% of the total cytosol was loaded in the first lane, whereas 25% of the TSM and TIM were loaded in the adjacent lanes. An anti-Flag Western blot assay was performed. c, left panel, 293T cells transfected with wild type (WT) PKK were lysed with 1% Triton X-100; 25% of the pellet and 2.5% of the supernatant (Lysate) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Flag-tagged PKK was visualized on a Western blot. Right panel, subcellular fractionation of 293T cells transfected with wild type or K51R PKK.

In the lower panel, individual fusion proteins were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and stained with Coomassie Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have confirmed that PKK and PKCβ can associate with each other in vivo. Flag-tagged PKK and HA-tagged PKCβ1 were co-transfected into 293T cells. As seen in Fig.4, reciprocal immunoprecipitations and Western blot analyses reveal that PKK and PKCβ associate with one another. We have demonstrated, using immunoprecipitated PKK and a fusion protein in which a portion of maltose-binding protein was fused to kinase dead PKCβ1, that PKK cannot phosphorylate PKCβI in vitro (data not shown). We therefore consider it extremely unlikely that PKK is required for PKCβ activation. We wished to establish whether PKCβ1 phosphorylates PKK in vitro. We transfected 293T cells with Flag-tagged PKK K51R and used an anti-Flag immunoprecipitate as the substrate in an in vitro kinase assay with purified PKCβI (Calbiochem). As seen in Fig.5 a, PKK K51R is readily phosphorylated by PKCβI. As depicted in Fig. 5 b, purified GST fusion proteins including C-terminal portions of PKK (residues 402–786 and 461–786) were phosphorylated in vitro, whereas a fusion protein including the N-terminal portion (residues 1–320) was not. However, in numerous experiments in which PKK was coexpressed with PKCβI or with PKCδ, we were unable to demonstrate a reproducible and significant enhancement of the catalytic activity of PKK by either of these PKCs (data not shown). Since PKK apparently exists in multiple forms, we decided to examine the subcellular localization of these distinct forms and to determine whether their generation depended on post-translational modification events. When COS and 293T cells transfected with Flag-tagged PKK were permeabilized and stained using indirect immunofluorescence, a fine reticular staining pattern was observed, suggesting that PKK associates with intracellular membranes (Fig.6 a). It was clear, however, that PKK was not present in the nucleus. Examination of PKK by subcellular fractionation (Fig. 6 b) revealed that a major portion of cellular PKK was cytosolic, the majority of this form being seen as a 110-kDa protein. It is possible that a proportion of this cytosolic protein is actually loosely associated with membranes in the cell, in keeping with our immunofluorescence results. Extraction of membranes with 1% Triton X-100 revealed no PKK, but two forms of PKK were noted in the Triton-insoluble membrane fraction, one of 100 kDa and another of 112 kDa (Fig. 6 b). Because we were concerned that a considerable amount of PKK may have been discarded in the nuclear fraction, we examined the Triton X-100-extracted supernatants and pellets of transfected 293T cells (Fig. 6 c, left panel). We also performed subcellular fractionation studies in which we separated the cytosol from all pooled membrane fractions in the cell including the membranes of the nuclear envelope. These separations were performed both with 293T cells transfected with wild type PKK as well as with cells transfected with K51R PKK (Fig. 6 c, right panel). As depicted in Fig. 6c, the major Triton X-100-soluble form of PKK migrates at 110 kDa, and a minor amount of this underphopshorylated 100-kDa form was also seen in the Triton X-100 supernatant. The soluble 110-kDa form corresponds to the 110-kDa form seen in the cytosol (Fig. 6, b and c, right panel). When detergent-resistant cell pellets were solubilized in SDS loading buffer, a 112-kDa form and a 100-kDa form of PKK were observed. Both the Triton X-100-resistant 112-kDa form and the 110-kDa Triton X-100-extractable form of PKK yield a 100-kDa species when subjected to lambda phosphatase treatment (Fig. 6 d). There are therefore three major forms of PKK that can be identified. Most of the PKK in the cell is a soluble, primarily cytosolic or loosely membrane-associated, phosphorylated 110-kDa form. A 100-kDa under- or nonphosphorylated form of PKK represents a small proportion of cytosolic PKK but makes up about one-half of the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of PKK. A 112-kDa hyperphosphorylated detergent-insoluble form of PKK was also readily identified. It is presumed that this protein is associated with cellular membranes or with cytoskeletal elements. Although it is possible that a portion of PKK may exist in detergent-insoluble glycolipid domains or lipid rafts, immunofluorescence studies did not reveal discernible accumulations of PKK on the inside of the plasma membrane in transfected cells (Fig. 6 a). In an attempt to obtain some insights into the relationship between these different forms of PKK, pulse-chase analyses of metabolically labeled PKK with and without co-transfected PKCβ were undertaken. In transiently transfected cells pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 10 min, wild-type PKK is initially synthesized as a 100-kDa protein. In cells that have been chased in complete medium for 20 min or longer, this 100-kDa protein is quantitatively converted into a larger 110-kDa form. Experiments in which PKK was examined after a 40-min or 1-h chase period are depicted in Fig. 7 a, left panel, and b, respectively. A similar conversion to the larger form has been noted after 20 min of chase, but only the 100-kDa form is seen after a 10-min chase period (data not shown). The post-synthetically derived larger form of PKK can be reduced to a 100-kDa form by treatment with lambda phosphatase, confirming that it is derived by phosphorylation (Fig. 7 a, right panel). A kinase dead K51R mutant form of PKK is also initially synthesized as a 100-kDa form but is not converted to the 110-kDa form seen with wild type PKK (Fig. 7 b). Small amounts of slower migrating K51R PKK proteins do appear with time; these might result from poorly defined transphosphorylation events (Fig. 7 b). PKK phosphorylation and conversion to the 110-kDa form depends at least in part on autophosphorylation. The delay in activating PKK suggests that the nascent enzyme might need to move to a specific location within the cell or that it may in some temporally influenced manner interact with an activating kinase or with some other regulator. We performed pulse-chase studies on PKK in cells co-transfected with PKCβI, and found that even with the co-expression of PKCβI, a similar delay was observed in the post-synthetic generation of the 110-kDa form of PKK (data not shown). Although PKK probably requires activation by a distinct regulator, which is most likely an activation loop kinase, overexpression of PKCβI does not influence the in vivogeneration of the 110-kDa form of PKK. We have identified and molecularly cloned a novel serine/threonine kinase, PKK, which physically associates with the catalytic domain of PKCβ1. This interaction was observed in the context of a two-hybrid assay using recombinant fusion proteins in vitro and in transfected cells in vivo. The interaction in the two-hybrid system suggests that PKCβI and PKK interact directly, and it is possible that PKK may represent a substrate of PKCβ and also of other members of the PKC family. The C-terminal portion of PKK is phosphorylated by PKCβI in vitro. We have no evidence to suggest that PKK is actually phosphorylated by PKCβI in vivo. We have also been unable to demonstrate that PKCβI influences the catalytic activity of PKK. The cloning of a human ankyrin repeat-containing kinase based on its association with PKC δ has been also recently described (27Bahr C. Rohwer A. Stempka L. Rincke G. Marks F. Gschwendt M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36350-36357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This kinase, DIK (for PKC δ-interacting kinase), is identical to human PKK. DIK was shown to interact with the catalytic domain of PKCδ, but PKCδ does not phosphorylate DIK. It is unclear whether there is any physiological relevance to the interaction of PKK with PKCβ or PKCδ. Although there is some overlap in the expression patterns of PKCβ and PKK during embryogenesis, there are clearly developing tissues in which PKK is expressed in the absence of PKCβ. It is formally possible that different members of the PKC family might regulate PKK activity in different cell types. At this time it is not possible to functionally link PKK to PKCβ or to any other member of the PKC family. There is an apparent post-synthetic delay in the autophosphorylation of PKK as suggested by pulse-chase studies. These results suggest that PKK may need to interact with an activation loop kinase or some other regulatory molecule in the cell, or to alter its subcellular localization, in order to be activated. Because the N-terminal catalytic domain of PKK is not phosphorylated by PKCβI, it is likely that PKCβI does not directly influence the phosphorylation of the activation loop of PKK. The activation loop of PKK contains a Ser-X-X-X-Ser motif, which suggests that PKK is related to MAP kinase kinases and that it may be also activated in vivo by a MAP kinase kinase kinase. Studies are currently in progress to identify the MAP kinase kinase kinase that may be required for the activation of PKK. The significance, if any, of the 112-kDa hyperphosphorylated, Triton X-100-resistant form of PKK is unclear. This fraction may potentially represent proteins that are in lipid rafts or proteins that are tightly bound to cytoskeletal components. The availability of antibodies that can be used to immunoprecipitate endogenous PKK would facilitate the examination of the biological significance of this form of PKK. The expression of PKK is very tightly regulated during development. This speaks to an important developmental role for this kinase. In preliminary studies in which we targeted PKK K51R to developing lymphocytes, early B and T cell development is significantly compromised. 2L. Chen, A. Cariappa, K. Haider, M. Tang, and S. Pillai, unpublished observations. The defect in B cell development observed in these preliminary studies is quite distinct from the peripheral B cell defect seen in mice lacking PKCβ (5Leitges M.

However, the REV1 protein does not possess such polymerase activity although it contains the conserved domain in translesion polymerases. In this work, we made various mutants of the human REV1S protein. Biochemical analysis of those mutant proteins showed that the domain required for deoxycytidyl transferase activity and DNA binding is located in a conserved domain of translesion DNA polymerases. We found a partial sequence of a candidate of the humanREV1 cDNA in a data base (accession number AJ131720). Based on the sequence, a portion of the cDNA fragment of the humanREV1 was amplified by RT-PCR from human breast cancer using primers 5′-AATCTAGCTGGAGCTGTTGA-3′ and 5′-GTAAAACCACCTGGACATTG-3′, and it was used as a probe for screening a human testis cDNA library (CLONTECH). In this library, the cDNA was inserted into a λ phage vector, λDR2 (CLONTECH). Four positive clones were obtained from 5 × 105 plaques. In all of the clones in these phages, the promoter-proximal side of the REV1 cDNA was truncated at an XbaI site, because XbaI had used to construct the cDNA library. One clone, named λRH2, was chosen for further analysis. To obtain the promoter-proximal side of the REV1 cDNA, another portion of the cDNA fragment was amplified by RT-PCR from human breast cancer using primers 5′-TTCTGTTTTGTCAAGGGCTG-3′ and 5′-TTGGTCTCTGCAAGGATTTC-3′, and it was used as a probe for screening the same library. One positive clone, named λRHT1, was obtained. This phage contained cDNA from the 5′-untranslated region to theXbaI site. Since the assembled cDNA encoded 1250 amino acid residues, 1 amino acid shorter than previously reported ones, we gave the name REV1S cDNA to the shorter form of theREV1 cDNA. The DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM accession number of the nucleotide sequence of the human REV1ScDNA is AB047646. For construction of full-length REV1S cDNA, theBamHI/XbaI fragment of REV1S cDNA from λRH2 was inserted into the corresponding site of pBluescript II SK (−). The resulting plasmid, pRH2IN, was digested withSacII and XbaI, and theSacII/XbaI fragment of REV1S cDNA from λRHT1 was inserted. The resulting plasmid, pREV1S, contained the fragment of the position 20–4227 of human REV1S cDNA (AB047646). Total mRNA from human mononuclear cells was used as a source of RT-PCR (30Hiramoto T.

To amplify a portion of the humanREV1/REV1S cDNA fragment, including the different region, the PCR primers 5′-GGGTCCGCAAGGCCGGAGAA-3′ and 5′-GCCTGGCCTCATAACTACAA-3′ were used. After heating at 95 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles of amplification were performed according the following conditions: 1 min of denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min of annealing at 58 °C, and 2 min of extension at 72 °C with TaKaRa ExTaq TM polymerase (TaKaRa). The amplified 1618-base pair cDNA fragment was directly sequenced from the primer 5′-GCGCAGAATCTGGATTCTCCCACA-3′ using an ABI 373 DNA sequencing system (Applied Biosystems). To quantify the ratio of the mRNA species, the amplified 1648-base pair cDNA was diluted and reamplified withPyrobest TM DNA polymerase (TaKaRa) by PCR using the primers 5′-GCGCAGAATCTGGATTCTCCCACA-3′ and 5′-32P-CCCAGCTGGAGTGGCAGTATTACC-3′. The PCR products were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. The radioactivity of each band of 96 and 93 bases, respectively, derived from REV1 and REV1S cDNA was measured using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). The BglII/XbaI fragment from the humanREV1S cDNA was used as a probe. Human multiple-tissue Northern filters (MTN1 and -2, CLONTECH) were hybridized with the probe in ExpressHybTM Hybridization Solution (CLONTECH) at 65 °C and washed with 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The hybridized humanREV1/REV1S mRNA was visualized by autoradiography at −80 °C. To introduce site-directed mutations, we used a PCR-based method. DNA fragments of the limited portions were amplified by RCR and cloned. After confirming the nucleotide sequence, the small fragments were assembled with other fragments of the wild-type cDNA.

The PCR fragment was cloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the resulting plasmid was named pRHFNde2. The NdeI/BamHI fragment from pRHFNde2 was inserted into the corresponding site of the pET15b vector (Novagen). The resulting plasmid, pET-C153 (Table I), was digested withBamHI and HindIII, and then theBamHI/HindIII fragment of pREV1S was inserted.

The resulting plasmid, pBAD-REV1S, produces a full-length REV1S protein (Table I). The expression of the h6-REV1S gene is induced by arabinose (32Mayer M.P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 163: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To introduce an NdeI site at position 1391 of the REV1S cDNA, PCR was carried out using primers (5′-ACACAGGACATATGTCAGTA-3′ and 5′-GATGGATCCGGTCTAGATGCTTTG-3′). The PCR fragment was cloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector. The resulting plasmid, pRHNXB6, was digested withXbaI and partially digested with BglII, and then the BglII/XbaI fragment from pRH2IN was inserted. The resulting plasmid, pRHNX, was digested with ApaI andXbaI, and then the ApaI/XbaI fragment of pRH2IN was inserted. The resulting plasmid was named pRHNXA. TheNdeI/BamHI fragment of pRHNXA was inserted into the corresponding site of pET15b. The resulting plasmid, pET-N407, produces a truncated protein starting from the 407th methionine (TableI). To introduce the D569A/E570A mutation, PCR was carried out using primers (5′-ACACAGGACATATGTCAGTA-3′ and 5′-TACCAGCGCTGCAGCACAAC-3′). The PCR fragment was cloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector, and the resulting plasmid was named pTUNE6. TheSphI/Eco47III fragment of pREV1S was replaced with the corresponding fragment of pTUNE6. The resulting plasmid, pREV1SA, was identical to pREV1S except for the D569A/E570A mutation. The BamHI/HindIII fragment of pREV1SA was inserted into the corresponding site of pET-C153. The resulting plasmid was named pET-C729A (Table I).

The resulting plasmid, pBADRNA, was digested with HindIII, and then the HindIII fragment of the 3′-portion of the REV1S gene of pREV1S was inserted. The resulting plasmid, pBAD-REV1SA, produces a full-length mutant protein, D569A/E570A (Table I). pET-C729 was digested withHindIII, and then the HindIII fragment of pREV1S was inserted. The resulting plasmid, pET-REV1S (Table I), was digested with SmaI and partially digested with XbaI. The 3′-end of this DNA was filled in with Klenow fragment (TaKaRa) and self-ligated. The resulting plasmid, pET-C885, produces a truncated protein containing extra amino acid residues, GCRNSISSLSMISCQT, at the C terminus (Table I). To introduce an NdeI site at position 905 of the REV1S cDNA, PCR was carried out using primers (5′-TTGGTGCATATGGTCAACAG-3′ and 5′-GATGGATCCGGTCTAGATGCTTTG-3′). The PCR fragment was cloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector, and the resulting plasmid was named pTOMO3. TheNdeI/BamHI fragment of pTOMO3 was inserted into the corresponding site of pET15b. The resulting plasmid was named pET-N245/C479 (Table I). The pET-REV1S was digested withBglII to remove two small BglII fragments, which were of the 5′-portion of the REV1S gene, and then theBglII fragment of pET-N245/C479 was inserted. The resulting plasmid, pET-N245, produces a truncated protein starting from the 245th methionine (Table I). A 3′-portion of the REV1S gene, the HindIII fragment, of each of pET-N245 and pET-N407 was replaced with theHindIII fragment of pET-C885. The resulting plasmids, pET-N245/C885 and pET-N407/C885, respectively, produce truncated proteins starting from the 245th and 407th methionine to the 885th arginine containing extra amino acid residues, GCRNSISSLSMISCQT, at the C termini (Table I). To replace the 811th serine codon with a stop codon and introduce a HindIII site at position 2615 of the REV1S cDNA, PCR was carried out using primers (5′-TGATGAAGCGCTGGTAGACA-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTCATATCTCATATATTTAG-3′). The PCR fragment was cloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector. The resulting plasmid was named p2620H-7. TheHindIII fragment of p2620H-7 was inserted into theHindIII site of pET-C729. The resulting plasmid produces a truncated protein at codon 810 (Table I). Five hundred ml of BL21 (DE3) (33Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) harboring pET-C885, pET-C810, pET-C729, pET-N245/C885, and pET-N407/C885 was grown in LB broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C with aeration until the culture reached an A600 value of 0.6. isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.2 mm, and the incubation was continued for 1 h. BL21 (DE3) harboring pET-N245 and pET-N407 was grown at 15 °C, and incubation was continued for 10 h after the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at anA600 value of 0.6. For the full-length h6-REV1S induction, BL21 (DE3) harboring pBAD-REV1S and pBAD-REV1SA was grown in SB medium (32Mayer M.P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 163: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) at 15 °C, and incubation was continued for 10 h after the addition ofl-(+)-arabinose to 1% at an A600value of 0.6. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 3 ml of buffer I (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) per 1.5 g of cells, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were thawed on ice, added to 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 1 mm, and lysed by adding 100 mm spermidine/lysozyme (4 mg/ml) in buffer I to 10 mm and 0.4 mg/ml, respectively. The cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, heated in a 37 °C water bath for 2 min, and then incubated on ice for 20 min. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The following column chromatography was carried out at 4 °C using a SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Two ml of the lysate was applied at 0.1 ml/min to a 1-ml HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which had been flashed with 2 ml of 0.1m NiSO4 and equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 10 mmimidazole. The column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer and then washed with 12 ml of buffer A containing 100 mmimidazole. The h6-REV1S and its derivatives were eluted with buffer A containing 300 mm imidazole. For further purification, 50 μl of the peak fraction was applied at 0.01 ml/min to a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A, and 40-μl fractions were collected. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin (Bio-Rad) as the standard. Deoxycytidyl transferase assays were performed essentially as described by Nelson et al. (7Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and Lin et al.(10Lin W. Xin H. Zhang Y. Wu X. Yuan F. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4468-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For the DNA substrate, a 5′-end 32P-labeled oligonucleotide primer 5′-CACTGACTGTATG-3′ annealed to an oligonucleotide template, 5′-CTCGTCAGCATCTTCAUCATACAGTCAGTG-3′, was used (18Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M. Araki M. Iwai S. Takio K. Hanaoka F. Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). The substrate was treated with 0.1 units of E. coli uracil-DNA glycosylase (New England Biolabs) at 30 °C for 30 min in a reaction mixture just before adding enzyme. The reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm dCTP, 100 nm substrate, and 1 μl of protein sample. The protein samples had been diluted with buffer A containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as indicated. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, reactions were terminated with 10 μl of stop solution (30 mm EDTA, 94% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanole). The reaction products were resolved on 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea and autoradiographed at −80 °C. The amount of DNA present in each band was quantified using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). The following binding method was adapted from the protocols of Masuda et al. (34Masuda Y. Bennett R.A. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30360-30365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 35Masuda Y. Bennett R.A. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30352-30359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As a substrate for binding measurements, the primed template for the deoxycytidyl transferase assay was used, but it was not treated with uracil-DNA glycosylase. Reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 nm substrate, and 1 μl of protein sample. The mixtures were incubated on ice for 15 min and loaded on a prerunning 4% polyacrylamide gel (79:1, acrylamide/bisacrylamide). The electrophoresis buffer contained 6 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm sodium acetate, and 0.1 mm EDTA, and the gels were subjected to a constant voltage of 8 V/cm applied for 2 h at 6 °C. Following gel electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiographed at −80 °C. The amounts of the binding fraction and free DNA were quantified using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). By searching a data base, we found a human cDNA that encoded a homologue of the yeast REV1 protein. The cDNA has been isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening as a protein interacting with α-integrin (36Wixler V. Laplantine E. Geerts D. Sonnenberg A. Petersohn D. Eckes B. Paulsson M. Aumailley M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The gene was a good candidate for the human REV1 gene. Because the cDNA was partial, we screened a human testis cDNA library to obtain a full-length cDNA. A clone isolated (accession number AB047646) looks like a truncated form, because an open reading frame started from the first ATG codon out-of-frame to the main open reading frame. Therefore, we screened a human liver cDNA library, and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed using total RNA from human breast cancer. However, we were not able to obtain any longer cDNA. This suggests that the cDNA is full-length. Lin et al.(10Lin W. Xin H. Zhang Y. Wu X. Yuan F. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4468-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and Gibbs et al. (11Gibbs P.E. Wang X.D. Li Z. McManus T.P. McGregor W.G. Lawrence C.W. Maher V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4186-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) also presented the same conclusion in recent reports. The human REV1 cDNA encodes an expected protein of 1250 residues, which is different from the recently reported REV1 protein of 1251 residues (Fig. 1). The former protein lacks an alanine residue at position 479 (Fig. 1). We denote here the shorter form of REV1 as REV1S. It was possible that theREV1S mRNA was a minority in the cell. To clarify this point, a portion of the REV1/REV1S cDNA fragments including position 479 was amplified by RT-PCR from mononuclear cells of 10 individuals and directly sequenced. Fig.2 A shows a typical result. The sequencing signals from all individuals are duplicated, since CTG and the intensity of both signals is a ratio of about 1:1, indicating that both forms exist in all individuals at similar amounts. DNA fragments including the region were amplified using a 5′-end32P-labeled primer as one of the PCR primers and separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea (Fig.2 B). A short band, 93-base product, was derived from theREV1S cDNA, and a band 3 bases longer was derived fromREV1 cDNA. The average ratio of the shorter and longer bands, REV1/REV1S, from 10 individuals was 1.25. We concluded that REV1S mRNA is one of the major forms.Figure 2Analysis of REV1 andREV1S mRNA.

The human REV1/REV1S mRNA was detected as a 4.4-kilobase transcript in all tissues examined, indicating that the REV1gene is ubiquitously expressed. Expression of the REV1 gene was relatively high in the testis and ovary and relatively low in the thymus and small intestine. The human REV1 protein possesses a deoxycytidyl transferase activity (10Lin W. Xin H. Zhang Y. Wu X. Yuan F. Wang Z.

https://openalex.org/W2079605437,"Depriving primary bone marrow-derived macrophages of colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) induces programmed cell death by apoptosis. We show that cell death is accompanied by decreases in the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein and the Ets2 and PU.1 proteins of the Ets transcription factor family. Macrophages require both priming and triggering signals independent of CSF-1 to kill neoplastic cells or microorganisms, and this activation of macrophage competence is accompanied by increased expression ofbcl-xL, ets2, andPU.1. Furthermore, we show that only Ets2 and PU.1, but not Ets1, function in a synergistic manner to transactivate thebcl-x promoter. The synergy observed between PU.1 and Ets2 is dependent on the transactivation domains of both proteins. Although other transcription factors like Fos, c-Jun, Myc, STAT3, and STAT5a are implicated in the activation of macrophage competence or in CSF-1 signaling, no synergy was observed between Ets2 and these transcription factors on the bcl-x promoter. We demonstrate that the exogenous expression of both Ets2 and PU.1 in macrophages increases the number of viable cells upon CSF-1 depletion and that Ets2 and PU.1 can functionally replace Bcl-xL in inhibiting Bax-induced apoptosis. Together, these results demonstrate that PU.1 and Ets2 dramatically increase bcl-x activation, which is necessary for the cytocidal function and survival of macrophages.

Ets members contain a conserved DNA-binding domain of ∼85 amino acids known as the Ets domain (reviewed in Ref. 1Ghysdael J. Boureux A. Yaniv M. Ghysdael J. Oncogenes as Transcriptional Regulators: Retroviral Oncogenes. 1. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 29-88Crossref Google Scholar). Ets1, the progenitor of v-Ets found in the E26 retrovirus, and Ets2 are 97% conserved in the Ets domain, whereas PU.1/Spi.1 is highly divergent in this domain (37% identity) (2Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). These differences in sequence identity of the Ets domain allow Ets1, Ets2, and PU.1 to bind to common as well as distinct optimal DNA target sequences. Ets proteins bind to DNA as monomers to activate transcription alone or in conjunction with other transcription factors binding to their respective sites (reviewed in Ref. 1Ghysdael J. Boureux A. Yaniv M. Ghysdael J. Oncogenes as Transcriptional Regulators: Retroviral Oncogenes. 1. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 29-88Crossref Google Scholar). PU.1 is expressed in early progenitor cells as well as in fully differentiated B cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. The importance of PU.1 in hematopoietic development has been confirmed by PU.1gene disruption studies showing that PU.1-deficient mice lack mature B cells, neutrophils, and macrophages (3McKercher S.

However, transgenic studies using a dominant-negative form of Ets2 under the control of a monocyte/macrophage-specific promoter have provided insight into the role of Ets2 in macrophages (6Jin D.I. Jameson S.B. Reddy M.A. Schenkman D. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 693-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Abnormal macrophage development occurs in these transgenic mice during the first 40 days following birth, and peritoneal macrophages obtained from these transgenic animals do not have the characteristic macrophage morphology when cultivated in vitro with CSF-1.1 These results imply the importance of Ets2 in the development of macrophages, yet the molecular mechanisms by which Ets2 functions had not been elucidated in these studies. The level of PU.1 is highly abundant in immature myeloid progenitor cells, and this level of expression remains high throughout macrophage differentiation (7Aperlo C. Pognonec P. Stanley E.R.

Recently, we showed that the induction of bcl-xL results from an increase inbcl-x promoter activity and that de novo protein synthesis is required for this activation of bcl-xtranscription (17Sevilla L. Aperlo C. Dulic V. Chambard J.C. Boutonnet C. Pasquier O. Pognonec P. Boulukos K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2624-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The human bcl-x promoter contains nine potential EBS. The capacities of PU.1 and Ets2 to individually transactivate the bcl-x promoter led us to ask whether PU.1 and Ets2 could compete or act in synergy to transactivate this promoter. In parallel, we wanted to determine the biological relevance of the coexpression of PU.1, ets2 andbcl-xL in primary macrophages upon induction of proliferation and differentiation and activation of macrophage competence and during programmed cell death by apoptosis. 293 cells, NIH3T3 cells, and NIH3T3 cells exogenously expressing the CSF-1R (NIH3T3-cfms) (18Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7924-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum. Primary bone marrow-derived cells were isolated from femurs of 2–3-month-old male C57BL/6 mice. Femurs were flushed with PBS to recover cells. After several washes in PBS, cells were cultivated either in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20% fetal calf serum, and 30% conditioned medium from L cells as a source of CSF-1 (19Stanley E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 116: 565-587Google Scholar) or in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and different concentrations of human recombinant CSF-1. After 4–5 days, fully differentiated macrophages were obtained. When recombinant CSF-1 was used, the concentrations are indicated below. IFN-γ (100 units/ml) or LPS (10 μg/ml) was added to macrophages for 4 h. The BAC1.2F5 and BACets2.1D macrophage cell lines have been previously described (17Sevilla L. Aperlo C. Dulic V. Chambard J.C. Boutonnet C. Pasquier O. Pognonec P. Boulukos K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2624-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For transfection studies, BAC1.2F5 macrophages were electroporated either with 5 μg of pRK-ets2 and 5 μg of pRK-PU.1 or with 5 μg of pRK-ΔPU.1 and 5 μg of pRK-Δets2 (for description of plasmids, see below) as previously described (7Aperlo C. Pognonec P. Stanley E.R. Boulukos K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6851-6858Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). BAC1.2F5 cells constitutively expressing Ets2 (BACets2.1D) were electroporated with 10 μg of pRK5 or pRK-ΔPU.1. After electroporation, the cells were plated with CSF-1 in duplicate dishes until they became adherent. Dishes were washed two times in PBS, and then the cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum with or without 20% conditioned medium as a source of CSF-1. The number of viable cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion. The cloning of the 5′-regulatory sequences of the bcl-x gene upstream of the luciferase gene has been described previously (17Sevilla L. Aperlo C. Dulic V. Chambard J.C. Boutonnet C. Pasquier O.

Ets2, a dominant-negative mutant of Ets2 (Δ1–238Ets2), Ets1, and PU.1/Spi.1 were cloned into pRK5 (20Schall T.J. Lewis M. Koller K.J. Lee A. Rice G.C. Wong G.H.W. Gatanaga T. Granger G.A. Lentz R.

A hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was inserted upstream of the first ATG codon of Ets2, ΔEts2, Ets1, or PU.1. ΔPU.1 was constructed by deleting sequences corresponding to the transactivation domains found in the first 144 amino acids. An HA tag was inserted upstream of the newly created ATG codon. 293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method in 96-well dishes by adding cells in suspension to pXP-Bcl-xPr(45 ng) and to different concentrations of pRK-ets1, pRK-PU.1, or pRK-ΔPU.1 (4–256 ng) or of pRK5-ets2 or pRK5Δ1–238ets2 (0.25–256 ng). In these experiments, 5 ng of pCMV-βgal was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. For experiments performed in 12-well dishes, 293 cells or NIH3T3 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method or with LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.), respectively, using 200 ng of the reporter construct in the presence of varying amounts of pRK5, pRK-ets2, or pRK-PU.1 as indicated in the figure legends with 20 ng of pCMV-βgal as an internal control for transfection efficiency as described above. One-half of the lysate was used to quantify transfected protein levels by Western analysis, and the other half was used to measure luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. For transfections in 24-well dishes, 293 cells or NIH3T3 cells exogenously expressing the CSF-1R were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method or with LipofectAMINE Plus, respectively, as described above for 12-well dishes. AP-1 activity was also measured using the full-length pXP-Bcl-xPr reporter construct. pXP-Bcl-xPr was cotransfected in 24-well dishes with 200 ng of pRK5, pRK-fos, or pRK-jun (21Pognonec P. Boulukos K.E. Aperlo C. Fujimoto M. Ariga H. Nomoto A. Kato H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2091-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and 20 ng of pCMV-βgal as described (17Sevilla L. Aperlo C. Dulic V. Chambard J.C. Boutonnet C. Pasquier O. Pognonec P. Boulukos K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2624-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). STAT activity was measured using the full-length pXP-Bcl-xPr reporter construct in the presence of STAT3 or STAT5a cloned into pRK5. For dimerization and activation of STAT proteins, NIH3T3-cfms cells were cotransfected with pXP-Bcl-xPr in 24-well dishes with varying amounts of STAT3, STAT5a, and Ets2. 12 h after transfection, the cells were placed in low serum conditions (0.5% fetal calf serum) for 24 h ad then stimulated with CSF-1 for 24 h. Several independent experiments using the different cell types and different DNA preparations were performed in triplicate or quadruplicate. Cell lysates were prepared as previously described (22Aperlo C. Boulukos K.E. Sage J. Cuzin F. Pognonec P. Genomics. 1996; 37: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48–72 h after transfections, cells lysates were prepared in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm dithiothreitol and analyzed for luciferase (Promega) and β-galactosidase (Tropix Inc., Galactolight) activities as described by the manufacturers. For 96-well dishes, the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were read on a MicrobetaTrilux 1450 luminescence counter (Wallac). All luciferase activities were corrected according to pCMV-βgal used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Cells were washed twice in 1× PBS. Cells were then lysed in RNA Insta-Pure (Eurogentec) as described by the manufacturer. 5 μg of total RNA was loaded and electrophoresed on a 2.2 m formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gel and then transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described by the manufacturer. Purifiedets2, PU.1/spi.1,bcl-xL, lysozyme M, IP10 (gift of T. A. Hamilton), and S26 cDNA fragments were used as probes. Probes with equal high specific activities were generated using the Stratagene Prime-It kit as described by the manufacturer. Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out at 42 °C in a solution of 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 50% formamide containing 20 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Normal stringency washes were performed at 50 °C using 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. All mRNA transcripts were visualized after exposure to Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C with Dupont Quanta Fast intensifying screens. Cells were lysed in Laemmli buffer, and equal amounts of total protein from each lysate were electrophoresed on 10–15% polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide gels. Migrated proteins were transferred to a Polyscreen polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described by the manufacturer; immunoblotted using anti-HA tag (12CA5), anti-Bcl-xL/S (S-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PU.1 (T-21, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Ets2 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-p42 MAPK (gift of Jacques Pouyssegur) antibodies; and revealed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described by the manufacturer. Apoptotic macrophage cells were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Interaction of annexin V with phosphatidylserines on the outer surface of cells was performed as described by the manufacturer with the following modifications. After incubating cells with annexin V and washing in binding buffer, they were fixed in PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 20 °C. Cells were washed in 1× PBS and incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed three times in 1× PBS and twice in water, and Moviol was added to the slide and mounted. At least 350 cells (in the absence of CSF-1) or 700 cells (in the presence of CSF-1) visualized by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining were counted to determine the number of viable cells. The number of annexin V-positive cells was calculated with respect to the number of viable cells. 293T cells were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes and transfected the following day using the calcium phosphate procedure with 10 μg of various combinations of plasmid DNA as indicated in the figure legend. 3 μg of a green fluorescent protein reporter plasmid was included in all transfections. 20 h post-transfection, cells were scraped and labeled with Alexa-conjugated annexin V (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then analyzed on a Beckman FACSCalibur using the FL1-H window to detect transfected cells (>50% of total cells), and the annexin V-positive cells found among these were quantitated using the FL3-H window. CSF-1 induces primary bone marrow-derived precursor cells to proliferate and then to differentiate into macrophages (BMM). We (23Aperlo C. Sevilla L. Guerin S. Pognonec P. Boulukos K.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 929-937PubMed Google Scholar) and others (24Keller J.R. Gooya J.M. Ruscetti F.W. Blood. 1996; 88: 863-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that cotreatment of hematopoietic progenitors or myeloblastic cells with leukemia inhibitory factor enhances the hematopoiesis process. We obtained murine BMM using different concentrations of CSF-1 (12 and 120 ng/ml) in the presence of 0.1 ng/ml leukemia inhibitory factor. Based on morphology (data not shown) and the expression of a macrophage-specific marker with bacteriolytic functions (lysozyme M (lysM)), BMM were obtained with both concentrations of CSF-1 used (Fig. 1 B). However, fewer macrophages were obtained with low doses of CSF-1 (Fig. 1 A). Northern analysis revealed that PU.1 was abundantly expressed under both culture conditions, paralleling the expression of lysozyme M. However, ets2 expression was detected when a high concentration of CSF-1 was used. It is worth noting that even small increases in Ets2 expression are sufficient to induce profound biological changes since a <2-fold induction of ets2mRNA expression has been shown to greatly affect bone and cartilage development in ets2 transgenic mice (25Sumarsono S.H. Wilson T. Tymms M.J. Venter D.J. Corrick C.M. Kola R. Lahoud M.H. Papas T.S. Seth A. Kola I. Nature. 1996; 379: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Interestingly,bcl-xL expression was clearly activated whenets2 was expressed (Fig. 1 B). These results show that there is a correlation of ets2 andbcl-xL expression upon treatment of primary precursor cells with concentrations of CSF-1 necessary to induce maximal proliferation and subsequent differentiation. In addition to inducing proliferation and differentiation, CSF-1 is required for the survival of BMM. To determine the expression patterns of PU.1, ets2, and bcl-xL upon death or survival signals, we first treated bone marrow-derived cells with conditioned medium containing CSF-1 for 5 days to obtain BMM (control BMM, 0 h). BMM were then either starved of CSF-1 (0 ng) or maintained with decreasing amounts of CSF-1 (120, 12, or 6 ng/ml) for 36 h. Macrophages were photographed at 24 and 36 h. Visualized in Fig.2 A is the morphology of primary macrophages upon the different treatments. At 24 and 36 h, a higher number of floating, round, refractile cells corresponding to dying cells was observed at 0, 6, or 12 ng of CSF-1. The number of adherent macrophages also decreased in the absence or presence of low doses of CSF-1 compared with the number of cells maintained at 120 ng/ml CSF-1. Total numbers of viable cells were confirmed by trypan blue exclusion for each test condition at 36 h (Fig.2 B). To demonstrate that the cell death observed in the absence of CSF-1 was indeed due to programmed cell death by apoptosis, macrophages maintained with or starved of CSF-1 were incubated with annexin V, an early marker of apoptosis. As shown in Fig.3, in the absence of CSF-1, 15% of the remaining cells were labeled with annexin V. The lower number of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained CSF-1-depleted cells (52% fewer compared with CSF-1-treated cells) and the typical compacted aspect of these nuclei reflect that the apoptotic process was underway.Figure 3CSF-1 starvation of primary bone marrow-derived macrophages induces programmed cell death by apoptosis. Fully differentiated primary macrophages were maintained with or starved of CSF-1 for 24 h. Cells were labeled with annexin V and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) as a control for nuclear staining of intact cells and were photographed (magnification × 100).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the cell death observed in CSF-1-starved BMM is accompanied by decreases in Bcl-xL protein expression, Western blot analysis was performed using lysates obtained from BMM starved of CSF-1 for 24 h and then restimulated with decreasing amounts of CSF-1 (120, 60, 12, or 0 ng/ml). After migration and transfer, the blot was incubated with an anti-Bcl-xL/Santibody recognizing both anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL and pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS proteins. As shown in Fig.4 A, Bcl-xL levels decreased in the absence of CSF-1, correlating with increases in cell death. The pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS product migrating at ∼25 kDa was not detected in these experiments. The amount of Ets2 and PU.1 proteins also decreased with decreasing concentrations of CSF-1. The conclusion from these results is that there is a tight correlation between the levels of Ets2, PU.1, and Bcl-xL protein expression and CSF-1. p42 MAPK was used as a control for the amount of protein loaded on the gel. Macrophage cytocidal activity for killing neoplastic cells or microorganisms requires both priming and triggering signals. Priming and triggering by IFN-γ and LPS, respectively, rapidly down-regulate CSF-1R expression even in the presence of CSF-1 (26Baccarini M. Dello Sbarba P. Buscher D. Bartocci A. Stanley E.R. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2656-2661PubMed Google Scholar, 27Vairo G. Royston A.K. Hamilton J.A. J. Cell Physiol. 1992; 151: 630-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, IFN-γ and LPS up-regulate bcl-xL, whose expression depends on de novo protein synthesis (14Okada S. Zhang H. Hatano M. Tokuhisa T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2590-2596PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the up-regulation of bcl-xL correlates withPU.1 and ets2 expression independent of CSF-1, we treated primary macrophages with IFN-γ and LPS. As shown in Fig.4 B, a 4-h treatment with IFN-γ or LPS up-regulated the expression of bcl-xL, ets2, andPU.1. IP10 was used as a positive control of an mRNA abundantly induced after IFN-γ or LPS treatment (28Omori S.A. Wall R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11723-11727Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that bcl-xL, ets2, and PU.1 are coexpressed in macrophages not only after a CSF-1 growth, differentiation, and survival stimulus, but also upon activation of macrophage functions independent of CSF-1. Our Northern and Western results show that PU.1, Ets2, and Bcl-xL are expressed upon CSF-1 survival, proliferation, or differentiation signals in primary macrophages. In addition, treatment of macrophages with IFN-γ and LPS, which down-regulates CSF-1 signaling (26Baccarini M. Dello Sbarba P. Buscher D. Bartocci A. Stanley E.R. J.

Human 293 cells were used in these studies for two reasons. First, it is not possible to transiently transfect primary macrophages due to their rapid cell death following addition of DNA to these cells (30Stacey K.J. Ross I.L. Hume D.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 75-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, no endogenous Ets2 or PU.1 was detected by Western analysis (data not shown) in 293 cells, thereby eliminating potential contributions from endogenously expressed proteins. By Western analysis, we verified that exogenously added HA-tagged Ets1, ΔEts2, Ets2, ΔPU.1, and PU.1 were expressed at comparable levels in transiently transfected 293 cells (Fig.5 A). Visualized in Fig.5 B (left panels) are the levels of the tagged Ets2 and PU.1 proteins following transfection of human 293 cells. In these experiments, the levels of transfected HA-PU.1 decreased as the levels of transfected HA-Ets2 were increased to keep the exogenously added amounts of total Ets proteins constant (transfected Ets DNAs at 400 ng). Corresponding transactivation studies from the same transfected samples are also shown using the 5′-regulatory sequences of the bcl-x gene upstream of the luciferase gene as the reporter (Fig. 5 B). The -fold inductions were higher when both Ets2 and PU.1 were equally expressed (200 ng of each DNA) than when either protein was expressed alone, but at twice the amount (400 ng of DNA) (see Fig. 5 B). To verify that this observation is valid in other cell systems, similar experiments were performed using murine NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 5 B, right panels). Similar results were obtained using NIH3T3 cells, in which Ets2 and PU.1 transactivated the bcl-x promoter better (8-fold) than Ets2 (3-fold) or PU.1 (2-fold) alone. These experiments indicate that, under constant levels of EBS activity, transcriptional activation is more efficient when both PU.1 and Ets2 are present. In other words, keeping the exogenous levels of Ets proteins constant, PU.1 and Ets2 transactivate the bcl-x promoter better than PU.1 or Ets2 alone in two different cell types from two different species. To investigate in greater detail this apparent cooperative effect,bcl-x promoter activity was monitored in 96-well plates to allow for the analysis of a wide range of Ets2 versus PU.1 concentrations. As the concentrations of either PU.1 or Ets2 alone increased, an increase in transcriptional activation was observed (Fig.6). As the concentrations of both PU.1 and Ets2 increased, so did their capacities to transactivate thebcl-x promoter. The inductions observed with Ets2 and PU.1 together result from a synergistic (and not an additive) effect between these factors. To address whether other Ets proteins could synergize with PU.1 or Ets2, the following experiments were performed. 293 cells were transiently transfected with Ets2 and Ets1 (Fig.7 A) or Ets1 and PU.1 (Fig.7 B). In the 96-well assay at the concentrations of DNA used, Ets1 alone transactivated the bcl-x promoter approximately two times better than Ets2 (Fig. 7 A). As the concentrations of Ets1 or Ets2 increased, so did the luciferase activities. The relative bcl-x promoter activity was not at all affected by cotransfections with increasing concentrations of both Ets1 and Ets2. Similar results were obtained using Ets1 and PU.1 (Fig.7 B). Cotransfection with Ets1 and PU.1 did not"

P-TEFb is a cyclin-dependent kinase that catalyzes Tat-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-5 of the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD). Ser-5 phosphorylation confers on the CTD the ability to recruit the mammalian mRNA capping enzyme (Mce1) and stimulate its guanylyltransferase activity. Here we show that Tat spearheads a second and novel pathway of capping enzyme recruitment and activation via a direct physical interaction between the C-terminal domain of Tat and Mce1. Tat stimulates the guanylyltransferase and triphosphatase activities of Mce1 and thereby enhances the otherwise low efficiency of cap formation on a TAR stem-loop RNA. Our findings suggest that multiple mechanisms exist for coupling transcription elongation and mRNA processing.

Our findings suggest that multiple mechanisms exist for coupling transcription elongation and mRNA processing. mRNA processing plays an important role in the expression of eukaryotic genes, and the earliest modification event is the formation of the 5′-terminal m7GpppN cap. Capping entails a series of three enzymatic reactions: (i) RNA triphosphatase removes the γ phosphate from the 5′-triphosphate end of the nascent mRNA to form a diphosphate terminus; (ii) RNA guanylyltransferase transfers GMP from GTP to the diphosphate RNA terminus to form GpppRNA; and (iii) RNA (guanine-7)-methyltransferase adds a methyl group to the N7 position of the cap guanine (1Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar). RNA capping is essential for cell growth,i.e. mutations of the triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase, or methyltransferase components of the capping apparatus that abrogate their catalytic activity are lethal in vivo (2Schwer B.

Phosphorylation of the CTD correlates with the release of preinitiation complexes from the promoter and recruitment of the capping enzyme to the transcription elongation complex. In the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the guanylyltransferase (Ceg1) and methyltransferase (Abd1) bind directly to the phosphorylated CTD (15McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K.

Although interaction between Pol II and capping enzymes offers an elegant explanation of the specific targeting of capping enzyme to nascent pre-mRNAs, it is conceivable that other factors are also involved in linking capping to transcription. For example, it was reported that hSpt5, the human homolog of yeast elongation factor Spt5, interacts directly with the mammalian capping enzyme and stimulates its guanylyltransferase activity (23Wen Y. Shatkin A.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1774-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). hSpt5 also plays a role in Tat transactivation of HIV-1 gene expression at the level of transcription elongation (24Kim J.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5960-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Wu B.F. Lane W.S. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 179-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). HIV-1 Tat is a small RNA-binding protein required for efficient transcription of HIV genes. Tat binds specifically to a structured RNA element, TAR, located at the 5′-end of the nascent HIV transcript. Tat contains two important functional domains: an arginine-rich region that mediates the binding of Tat to TAR RNA and an activation domain that mediates interactions with cellular factors. Tat functions through TAR to control an early step in transcription elongation that is sensitive to protein kinase inhibitors and requires the Pol II CTD (26Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Tat increases the processivity of RNA polymerase complexes that would otherwise prematurely terminate. This function of Tat is predicated on its ability to enhance the activity of a positive transcription elongation factor, P-TEFb (27Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Components of the P-TEFb complex required for its activity include a catalytic protein kinase subunit Cdk9 (previously known as PITALRE) (28Mancebo H.S. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D. Price D. Flores O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2633-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 29Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and regulatory subunits cyclin T1, cyclin T2a, or cyclin T2b, which associate with Cdk9 and increase its kinase activity (29Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 30Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T.

Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Cyclin T1 interacts directly with the activation domain of Tat. When the proteins are bound to TAR RNA, Tat interacts with the bulge region, whereas cyclin T1 binds to the loop segment (31Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD by P-TEFb kinase is stimulated by Tat and leads to the formation of processive transcription elongation complexes. Because Tat transactivation and capping are both correlated with CTD phosphorylation at an early stage of transcription elongation, it is conceivable that Tat may interact physically or functionally with mammalian capping enzyme. Here, we show a direct association between Tat and Mce1 in vitro. We find that Tat stimulates mRNA capping in vitro by enhancing the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase activities of Mce1. Moreover, Tat stimulates the capping of TAR mRNA, which is not guanylylated efficiently by Mce1, presumably because the 5′-terminus is encompassed within a stable RNA hairpin. We suggest a model whereby Tat stimulation of TAR mRNA capping contributes to the activation of HIV gene expression. Recombinant wild-type HIV-1 Tat, hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Tat, and Tat deletion mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. These fusion proteins consisted of an N-terminal GST moiety followed by a thrombin cleavage site and variable C-terminal polypeptides segments comprising wild-type Tat-(1–86) with or without HA tag; TatΔ2/36 (a deletion from amino acids 2 to 36 in the transactivation domain); Tat48Δ (a deletion of amino acids 49–86 including the RNA binding domain). Recombinant fusion proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity from bacterial lysates by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Briefly, lysates were mixed with a 1-ml slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then poured into a column and washed with 20 ml of PBS (136 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.76 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The immobilized GST·Tat beads were used in protein binding assays described below. Alternatively, the Tat proteins were recovered from glutathione-Sepharose beads by thrombin cleavage according to previously described procedures (47Rhim H. Echetebu C.O. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J. AIDS. 1994; 7: 1116-1121PubMed Google Scholar). The eluted Tat proteins were stored in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 2.5 mmCaCl2 at −80 °C. Full-length mouse capping enzyme Mce1, the N-terminal RNA triphosphatase domain Mce1-(1–210), and the C-terminal RNA guanylyltransferase domain Mce1-(211–597) were produced in bacteria as N-terminal His-tagged fusions and purified as described (19Ho C.K. Sriskanda V. McCracken S. Bentley D. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9577-9585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures containing 3–5 μg of the wild-type or mutant (Δ2/36, 48Δ) GST·Tat proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and 1 μg of the wild-type or mutant Mce1 proteins in 300 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ZnCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed four times in 600 μl of washing buffer (30 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 5 mm DTT) and then resuspended in 200 μl of washing buffer and split into two equal aliquots. One of the aliquots was treated with 10 units of thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 10 min at room temperature. Thrombin digestion was then quenched by adding 20 μg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The second aliquot was not treated with thrombin. The beads were then separated from the supernatant by centrifugation. The supernatant fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The protein contents of the gel were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane that was then immunoblotted with rabbit antiserum raised against the guanylyltransferase domain Mce1-(211–597). Immune complexes were detected by using an ECL Western blotting kit according to the instructions of the vendor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 40 μg of His-tagged Mce1-(1–210) or Mce1-(211–597)was adsorbed to 100 μl of Ni2+-agarose beads (Qiagen) during a 1-h incubation at 4 °C in 500 μl of Ni2+-binding buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of binding buffer A and resuspended in 250 μl of binding buffer A. The beads were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of purified HA-tagged Tat protein in binding buffer A. The beads were washed six times with 1 ml of binding buffer A, and the bound proteins were then stripped from the beads by boiling in 25 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 12% glycerol, 4% SDS, 100 mm DTT, and 0.01% Coomassie Blue G-250). Polypeptides were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide gels. The gel contents were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and Tat protein was detected by immunoblotting with a biotin-conjugated antibody against the HA tag. The blot was developed using a chemiluminescence kit. Guanylyltransferase activity of capping enzyme was assayed by the formation of the covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm DTT, 5 mmMgCl2, 1.25 μm [α-32P]GTP, and capping enzyme and Tat proteins as specified were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was halted by addition of SDS to 1% final concentration. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Capping enzyme-[32P]GMP complexes were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by scanning the gel with a phosphorimager. RNA triphosphatase activity was assayed by liberation of 32Pi from [γ-32P]GTP-labeled poly(A) RNA synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase transcription. The template strand encoded the sequence for poly(A) RNA starting with G at position +1. In vitrotranscription reactions were carried out as described previously (48Huq I. Ping Y.H. Tamilarasu N. Rana T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5172-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in the presence of [γ-32P]GTP. 5′-GTP-terminated 29-mer poly(A) was purified on a 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel. RNA triphosphatase reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm DTT, 10 pmol of 5′-GTP-terminated poly(A), and capping enzyme and Tat proteins as specified were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was halted by addition of 1 μl of 88% formic acid. Aliquots of the mixtures were applied to a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate, which was developed with 0.75 m potassium phosphate (pH 4.3). The release of 32Pi was quantified by scanning the TLC plate with a phosphorimager. Triphosphate-terminated 17-mer RNA with no apparent secondary structure and TAR RNA containing a bulge and loop region (see Fig. 7A) were prepared by in vitro T7 polymerase transcription and then purified by electrophoresis through a 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel as described previously (48Huq I. Ping Y.H. Tamilarasu N. Rana T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5172-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). [32P]GMP was incorporated at internal positions in the RNAs by including [α-32P]GTP in the transcription reactions. Capping reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm DTT, 50 μm GTP, 2.5 mm MgCl2 10 pmol of RNA, 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega), and capping enzyme and Tat proteins as specified were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by adding 200 μl of stop solution (0.3m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m sodium acetate, 0.5% SDS, 2 mm EDTA). The mixtures were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and then with chloroform. RNAs were recovered by ethanol precipitation and then analyzed by electrophoresis through a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 7m urea in Tris-Borate-EDTA. Labeled RNA products were visualized by autoradiography. The internally labeled capped RNA product migrated more slowly than the uncapped substrate RNA. The extent of capping was quantitated by scanning the gel with a phosphorimager. To test for interaction between Tat and mammalian capping enzyme, a purified GST·Tat fusion protein was linked to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the beads were incubated with purified recombinant full-length Mce1. After washing the beads with buffer to remove unbound protein, the bound Mce1 was recovered from the beads by treatment with thrombin, which cleaved the GST·Tat fusion protein between the GST and Tat domains (Fig.1A). Released Mce1 was detected in the supernatant fraction by immunoblotting with antiserum raised against the C-terminal guanylyltransferase domain (Fig.1B, lane 3). Mce1 was not detected in the supernatant when the thrombin cleavage step was omitted (Fig.1B, lane 2). Alanine mutations of the active site cysteine of the RNA triphosphatase domain of Mce1 (C126A) or the active site lysine of the guanylyltransferase domain of Mce1 (K294A) that abrogate the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase activities, respectively, did not interfere with the binding of Mce1 to immobilized Tat (Fig. 1B, lanes 6 and 9). These results indicate that mammalian capping enzyme can interact directly with Tatin vitro independent of the competence of Mce1 to catalyze phosphoryl or nucleotidyl transfer. Tat protein can be divided into two major functional domains (Fig.2A). The transactivation domain (amino acids 1–48) is required for recruitment of cyclin T1 by Tat to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter (31Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain (amino acids 49–86) includes a basic region and is required for both RNA binding and nuclear localization of Tat (32Dingwall C. Ernberg I. Gait M.J. Green S.M. Heaphy S. Karn J. Lowe A.D. Singh M. Skinner M.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4145-4153Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Two truncated versions of Tat, TatΔ2/36 and Tat48Δ, which are deleted in the transactivation domain and RNA binding domain, respectively, were expressed as GST fusion proteins and tested for binding to the guanylyltransferase domain of mammalian capping enzyme, Mce1–211-597). The guanylyltransferase bound to beads containing immobilized wild-type Tat and TatΔ2/36 (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and5), but not to Tat48Δ (Fig. 2B, lane 7). Similar results were obtained for binding of full-length Mce1 to the truncated Tat proteins (data not shown). We conclude that the Tat segment from amino acids 37–86 suffices for the binding of capping enzyme and that the transactivation domain per se does not interact with capping enzyme or its guanylyltransferase component. Are there functional consequences for the interaction of mammalian capping enzyme with Tat? To address this question, we tested the effects of full-length Tat and truncated Tat derivatives on the guanylyltransferase and triphosphatase activities of Mce1. The 597-amino acid mammalian capping enzyme consists of an N-terminal triphosphatase domain (amino acids 1–210) and a C-terminal guanylyltransferase domain (amino acids 211–597). The guanylyltransferase component of the enzyme catalyzes two sequential nucleotidyl transfer reactions involving a covalent enzyme-guanylate intermediate (33Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7237-7245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the first partial reaction, nucleophilic attack on the α-phosphate of GTP by enzyme results in liberation of pyrophosphate and formation of a covalent adduct in which GMP is linked via a phosphoamide bond to the ε-amino group of a Lys-294 (16Yue Z.

The nucleotide is then transferred to the 5′-end of the RNA acceptor to form an inverted (5′)-(5′) triphosphate bridge structure, GpppN. The extent of Mce1·[32P]GMP complex formation during reaction with 1.25 μm GTP was proportional to input protein up to 0.15 μm Mce1 and leveled off as Mce1 was increased to 0.5 μm (Fig.3A). In the linear range of Mce1-dependence, ∼9% of the input protein molecules were labeled with [32P]GMP. Enzyme-[32P]GMP complex formation by 0.05 μm Mce1 was stimulated by Tat and TatΔ2/36, but Tat48Δ had no effect (Fig. 3B). Optimal stimulation (4–5-fold) was attained at a 2:1 molar ratio of Tat to Mce1 (Fig. 3C). The activity of the autonomous guanylyltransferase domain Mce1-(211–597) was similarly stimulated by Tat and TatΔ2/36, but not Tat48Δ (data not shown). Tat had no stimulatory effect on enzyme-GMP formation by purified recombinant yeast guanylyltransferase Ceg1 (data not shown). These results indicate that Tat interaction with Mce1 stimulates the guanylyltransferase activity of mammalian capping enzyme and the Tat domain from amino acids 37–86 suffices for this function. The RNA triphosphatase domain of mammalian capping enzyme displays extensive amino acid sequence similarity to protein tyrosine phosphatases and dual-specificity protein phosphatases. By analogy to the protein phosphatases, it is proposed that mammalian RNA triphosphatase executes a two-step phosphoryl transfer reaction involving a covalent enzyme-(cysteinyl-S)-phosphate intermediate (19Ho C.K.

In the first partial reaction, nucleophilic attack by a cysteine thiolate (Cys-126 in Mce1) on the γ-phosphate of RNA results in release of diphosphate-terminated RNA and formation of a phosphoenzyme. The phosphate is then transferred from Cys-126 to water to release Pi. The phosphoenzyme intermediate has not yet been demonstrated directly. RNA triphosphatase activity is assayed by the release of 32Pi from γ-32P-labeled triphosphate-terminated RNA. Hydrolysis of 1 μm [γ-32P]GTP-labeled poly(A) by Mce1 increased linearly from 2–8 nm enzyme and was nearly quantitative at 10 nm (Fig.4A). The titration profile of the isolated triphosphatase domain Mce1-(1–210) was more sigmoidal, but the slope of the curve in the linear range (4–12 nmenzyme) was similar to that of Mce1 (Fig. 4A). RNA γ-phosphate hydrolysis by 3 nm Mce1 was stimulated 6–8-fold by the inclusion of 6–18 nm Tat (Fig.4B). Note that Tat by itself had no detectable RNA triphosphatase activity at the highest level of input Tat used in this experiment (data not shown). The remarkable finding was that Tat did not stimulate RNA γ-phosphate hydrolysis by 5 nm of the N-terminal RNA triphosphatase domain Mce1-(1–210), which catalyzed a similar level of basal RNA hydrolysis as 3 nm Mce1 (Fig.4B). To investigate whether Tat interacts directly with the RNA triphosphatase domain, we established an affinity chromatography assay using His-tagged capping enzyme domains immobilized on Ni2+-agarose beads (Fig.5A). The beads were incubated with HA-tagged Tat. After washing the beads with buffer to remove unbound protein, the bead-bound material was stripped from the beads with SDS, and the presence of HA·Tat in the SDS-eluate was detected by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig.5B, HA·Tat was adsorbed to beads containing the immobilized RNA triphosphatase domain Mce1-(1–210) (lane 3), whereas only a scant amount of HA·Tat was retained on the control Ni2+-agarose beads (lane 1). HA·Tat also bound to beads containing immobilized guanylyltransferase domain Mce1-(211–597) (lane 2). This experiment reciprocates the finding that soluble guanylyltransferase domain was bound to immobilized Tat (Fig. 2). The results presented thus far demonstrate that Tat interacts with the isolated RNA triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase domains of mammalian capping enzyme. Whereas Tat-binding stimulates the guanylyltransferase activity of Mce1 and the C-terminal domain, Tat-stimulation of the RNA triphosphatase reaction appears to occurs only in the context of the full-length Mce1. The enzymatic addition of an unlabeled cap guanylate to the 5′-end of an internally labeled RNA molecule results in a characteristic slowing of the electrophoretic mobility of the RNA, equivalent to about a 2-nucleotide increase in apparent chain length (36Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29386-29392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The change in mobility upon addition of capping enzyme has been used to detect cap formation on RNAs as long as 78 nucleotides (37Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here we studied the complete capping reaction of Mce1 using a synthetic 17-mer triphosphate-terminated RNA substrate that was labeled internally with [32P]GMP (Fig.6A). Incubation of 0.5 μm RNA substrate with Mce1 in the presence of 50 μm cold GTP and magnesium chloride resulted in transfer of GMP to the 5′-end, yielding a capped species that migrated more slowly than the input substrate RNA (Fig. 6B). Formation of the capped species was dependent on inclusion of GTP in the reaction mixture (not shown). The extent of capping was proportional to input Mce1 and saturated at 0.4 μm Mce1 with about 70% of the input RNA being capped (Fig. 6C). In the linear range of enzyme-dependence, 1 pmol of RNA was capped per pmol of the Mce1. The level of capping catalyzed by 50 nm Mce1 (1 pmol of input Mce1) was increased 6-fold by Tat (Fig. 6D). The stimulation was Tat concentration-dependent and saturation was attained at a 4:1 molar ratio of Tat to Mce1. An identical capping stimulation profile was observed for the deletion mutant TatΔ2/36 containing an intact RNA binding dom"
https://openalex.org/W2040736557,"Two signaling pathways, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent pathway and the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent pathway, have been known to mediate megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In this study, we examined whether 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), known as a substrate of ERK/MAPK and a signal-inducible IκBα kinase, would link two pathways during the differentiation. RSK1 was activated in a time- and dose-dependent manner during the PMA-induced differentiation. Overexpression of wild-type or dominant inhibitory mutant (D205N) of RSK1 enhanced or suppressed PMA-stimulated NF-κB activation and megakaryocytic differentiation as shown by morphology, nonspecific esterase activity, and expression of the CD41 megakaryocytic marker, respectively. In addition, overexpression of the dominant inhibitory mutant (S32A/S36A) of IκBα inhibited PMA-stimulated and RSK1-enhanced megakaryocytic differentiation, indicating that NF-κB mediates a signal for megakaryocytic differentiation downstream of RSK1. PMA-stimulated activation of ERK/MAPK, RSK1, and NF-κB and the PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation were prevented by pretreatment with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of the mitogen-activated ERK kinase (MEK). Therefore, these results demonstrate that the sequential ERK/RSK1/NF-κB pathway mediates PMA-stimulated megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells.

Hematopoiesis in vertebrates, which is a complicated multistep process, is a paradigm for the development of diverse specialized cell types from multipotent progenitors.

Blood. 1975; 45: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), can be induced by PMA, a protein kinase C activator, to differentiate into cells with megakaryocytic characteristics (3Colamonici O.R.

These include changes in cell morphology and adhesive properties, cell growth arrest, and expression of markers associated with the megakaryocytes.Despite recent advances in studying the molecular events associated with PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells, the exact signaling mechanism is not fully understood. We have previously shown that PMA-induced differentiation of K562 cells is inhibited by the treatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, an inhibitor of NF-κB (7Kang C.D. Lee B.K. Kim K.W. Kim C.M. Kim S.H. Chung B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and NF-κB subunit-transfected cells are more sensitive to PMA-induced differentiation than their parental cells, and PMA-induced differentiation was enhanced by the pretreatment with IκBα antisense oligonucleotide (8Kang C.D.

In contrast, it has been reported recently that overexpression of the constitutively active mutants of MEK induce megakaryocytic differentiation in K562 cells, and blockade of MEK activation by PD98059 reverses both the growth arrest and the morphological changes of K562 cells induced by PMA treatment (9Whalen A.M.

This suggested that a sustained activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway is necessary to induce a differentiation program along the megakaryocyte lineage in K562 cells.In our previous study (8Kang C.D. Han C.S. Kim K.W. Do I.R. Kim C.M. Kim S.H. Lee E.Y. Chung B.S. Cancer Lett. 1998; 132: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although there were no differences in the basal or PMA-stimulated activities of ERK/MAPK between the parental and NF-κB subunit-transfected K562 cells, PMA-induced differentiation was almost completely inhibited in both parental and NF-κB subunit-transfected cells after preventing PMA-stimulated activation of MAP kinase by the pretreatment of PD98059. Therefore, it is likely that the MAP kinase pathway is required for the PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells, suggesting that activation of MAP kinase works through NF-κB activation, or activation of both NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways are involved.Two recent reports have shown that the 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK1) is an essential kinase required for phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα in response to mitogens, including PMA (12Ghoda L.

Zantema A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3133-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Therefore, RSK1 is a good candidate to connect the ERK/MAPK pathway and the NF-κB pathway in PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells. In this study, the role of RSK1 in PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells was investigated.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CultureK562 cells were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). For the experiment, exponentially growing K562 cells were collected (1,200 × g, 10 min) and resuspended in fresh culture medium.Ribosomal S6 Kinase AssayThe S6 kinase assays were performed using S6 kinase Assay Kit from Upstate biotechnology, Inc., according to manufacturer's protocol. Cells (1 × 106/ml) were harvested, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and then scraped into 150 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3Vo4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF). After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates (200 μg of protein) were mixed with 2 μg of anti-p90RsK1 antibody (rabbit polyclonal IgG) and then immunoprecipitated with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were collected by protein A-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C.For in vitro kinase assay, the immunoprecipitates/protein A-Sepharose beads were washed once with ice-cold cell lysis buffer and three times with an assay dilution buffer (ADB: 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mmEGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). The immunoprecipitates/protein A-Sepharose beads were then resuspended in ADB containing substrate mixture (50 μm substrate peptide), inhibitor mixture (4 μm protein kinase C inhibitor peptide, 0.4 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, and 4 μm Compound 24571 in ADB), and [γ-32P]ATP mixture. The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, and then 20 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted onto p81 phosphocellulose squares (1.5 × 1.5 cm, Upstate biotechnology, Inc.). The papers were washed five times for 5 min each with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once for 3 min with acetone. Dried papers were wrapped, and radioactivity was detected with a Molecular Imager (GS-525, Bio-Rad).Plasmids and DNA TransfectionpcDNA3-Rsk1, pcDNA3-Rsk1- D205N, and pCMV-IκBα-32A36A (kindly donated by Dr. Zantema, Leiden University, Netherlands) have been described elsewhere (13Schouten G.J. Vertegaal A.C. Whiteside S.T. Israel A. Toebes M. Dorsman J.C. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3133-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-Rsk1-D205N has a mutated ATP binding site of the amino-terminal kinase domain of RSK1, and pCMV-IκBα-S32AS36A contains mutated alanines at the serine phosphorylation sites. pCMV-p50 and -p65 are expression plasmids in which the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB were cloned inHindIII/XbaI of pRc/CMV (Invitrogen), respectively (8Kang C.D.

Electroporation was carried out using an Electroporator II (Invitrogen) at 1,500 V/cm, 50 microfarads condition. After electroporation, stable transformants were selected with G418 (475 μg/ml) and identified by Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibody against RSK1 (Upstate biotechnology, Inc.) and IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA).Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssaysNuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (8Kang C.D.

Cancer Lett. 1998; 132: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 2 × 106 cells were harvested and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm PMSF). The cells were allowed to be swollen on ice for 10 min, after which the cells were resuspended in 30 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Then the tube was vigorously mixed on a vortex machine three times for 10 s, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 250 × g for 10 min to pellet the nuclei. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 26% glycerol (v/v), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm PMSF), incubated on ice for 30 min with intermittent mixing, and centrifuged at 24,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The nuclear extract was either used immediately or stored at −70 °C for later use.Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed by incubating 10 μg of nuclear extract for 20 min at room temperature with 17.5 fmol of 32P-end labeled 22-mer double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAT TTT CCC AGG C-3′) from the κ light chain enhancer (15Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's manual (Promega, Co.). For gel mobility supershift assay, 1 μg of anti-p50 antibody was incubated with whole cell extracts for 20 min at 21 °C prior to NF-κB binding reaction.Nonspecific Esterase StainingThe cytocentrifuged slides were stained with a nonspecific esterase staining kit (Muto Pure Chemicals, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) according to manufacturer's protocol. Nonspecific esterase-stained slides were examined microscopically for intracellular dark red granules.Kinase Assays for MAP Kinase/ERK ActivityMAP kinase activity was measured with a p44/42 MAP Kinase Assay Kit (New England Biolabs, Inc.) according to manufacturer's protocol. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF for 15 min at 4 °C. 200 μl of cell lysate (∼200 μg of protein) were mixed with monoclonal phospho-MAPK antibody (1:50 dilution) and incubated with gentle rocking for overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by protein A-Sepharose beads (10–20 μl) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice with cold lysis buffer and twice with 500 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2). Kinase assay was performed by incubating the suspended pellet with kinase buffer containing 100 μm ATP and GST-Elk1 fusion protein for 30 min at 30 °C. The samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phospho(Ser383)-Elk1 was detected with specific antibody using Western blot analysis.Flow Cytometric AnalysisCells were harvested after treatment with PMA for 72 h and washed in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (PBS-B). 2–5 × 105 cells were incubated at 30 °C in 100 μl of PBS-B containing 10 μl anti-CD41-PE or anti-CD61-FITC (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Cells were washed in PBS-B, resuspended in PBS with 1% glycerol, and analyzed with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter using CellQuest 8.6 (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA).RESULTSActivation of RSK1 after Treatment of PMAAs we mentioned previously, the ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK1) is a good candidate connecting the ERK/MAPK pathway and the NF-κB pathway, both of which are known to be involved in PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells. Therefore, we examined whether RSK1 could be activated by PMA in K562 cells.To measure the PMA-stimulated RSK1 activity, an immune complex kinase assay was done. When K562 cells were treated with various concentrations of PMA for 1 h, RSK1 was activated in a dose-dependent manner up to 10 nm of PMA (Fig.1 A). After treatment with 10 nm PMA for the indicated time (Fig. 1 B), a sustained activation of RSK1 was shown over at least 12 h with ∼10-fold activation at 1 h peak time. This result is consistent with sustained activation of the ERK/MAPK during PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells (11Racke F.K. Lewandowska K. Goueli S. Goldfarb A.N. J. Biol.

After stimulation of PMA, K562-RSK1 or K562-RSK1 (D205N) cells have higher or lower RSK1 activity compared with parental K562 cells, respectively (Fig.2 A). During the transfection of wild-type RSK1, we observed some adherent cells with a morphological resemblance to the PMA-stimulated population (Fig.2 B), suggesting that the RSK1-dependent pathway might be involved in megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells. Practically, these cells, which may be high expressors of RSK1, could not be expanded due to a severely retarded growth rate. On the other hand, all isolated RSK1 transfectants showed no or very weak evidence of differentiation, such as morphological change, nonspecific esterase activity, or expression of surface markers (see Figs 5 and7 B). Empty vectors did not affect the PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells (data not shown).Figure 2Isolation of wild-type or dominant inhibitory mutant (D205N) of RSK1-transfected K562 cells.

Han C.S. Kim K.W. Do I.R. Kim C.M. Kim S.H. Lee E.Y. Chung B.S. Cancer Lett. 1998; 132: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), a NF-κB mobility shift assay was done to examine whether NF-κB activity of K562 cells would be modulated after transfection with wild-type RSK1 or the dominant inhibitory mutant (D205N) of RSK1. Overexpression of RSK1 or RSK1 (D205N) enhanced or suppressed PMA-stimulated NF-κB activity, respectively (Fig. 3, upper panel). Consistently, degradation of IκBα was enhanced or suppressed by overexpression of RSK1 or RSK1 (D205N) (Fig. 3,lower panel). These results are consistent with the RSK1 activities of K562-RSK1 and K562-RSK1 (D205N) cells (Fig.2 A), indicating that activity of NF-κB could be modulated downstream of RSK1 in K562 cells.Figure 3Effect of wild-type or dominant inhibitory mutant of RSK1 on PMA-induced activation of NF-κB in K562 cells. Upper panel, activities of NF-κB after treatment with PMA in the parental and wild-type or dominant negative inhibitory mutant (D205N) of RSK1-transfected K562 cells.

To address this hypothesis, we isolated a double transfectant, which expresses both a dominant inhibitory mutant of IκBα and a wild-type RSK1 as much as each single transfectant (Fig.4 A). K562 and K562-IκBα (S32A/S36A) cells had comparable activities of RSK1, and K562-RSK1 and K562-RSK1/IκBα (S32A/S36A) cells had comparable activities of RSK1 (Fig. 4 B). As shown in Fig. 4 C, overexpression of IκBα (S32A/S36A) inhibited both PMA-stimulated NF-κB activation and RSK1-mediated NF-κB activation.Figure 4Effect of dominant inhibitory mutant (S32A/S36A) of IκBα on PMA-stimulated and RSK1-mediated activation of NF-κB.

NF-κB DNA binding activity was assayed as described in the legend of Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Then, we have examined the effect of RSK1 and NF-κB activities on PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells. PMA-induced differentiation of K562 cells was enhanced or suppressed by overexpression of RSK1 or RSK1 (D205N), respectively, as shown by morphology (Fig. 5 A) and nonspecific esterase assay (Fig. 5 B), indicating that PMA-induced differentiation of K562 cells could be affected by RSK1 activity. Overexpression of IκBα (S32A/S36A) prevented morphological change and activation of nonspecific esterase induced by PMA and also inhibited RSK1-mediated differentiation of K562 cells (Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, when K562 cells were transfected transiently with both subunits of NF-κB, some cells underwent morphological changes and were adherent to the culture dish (Fig. 5 C). These results demonstrate that the RSK/NF-κB pathway mediates PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells.Effect of ERK Activity on RSK1 Activation and RSK1-mediated NF-κB Activation of K562 CellsIf the sequential ERK/RSK/NF-κB pathway plays a role in PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells, pretreatment with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK that prevents the activation of MEK and subsequently the activation of ERK/MAPK, would lead to prevention of the activation of the ERK/RSK/NF-κB pathway and subsequent megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells induced by PMA. When PMA-stimulated activation of ERK was prevented by the pretreatment with PD98059 in K562 and K562-RSK1 cells (Fig. 6 A), PMA-stimulated activation of RSK1 and NF-κB was also prevented (Fig. 6, Band C, respectively), indicating that activation of RSK1 and NF-κB depends on ERK/MAPK activation. In addition, PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation was prevented by the pretreatment with PD98059 in both K562 and K562-RSK1 cells (Fig. 6 D). From these results, it could be concluded that PMA-stimulated activation of RSK1 and NF-κB is ERK-dependent, and sequential activation of ERK, RSK1, and NF-κB mediates PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells.Figure 6Effect of PD98059 on RSK1 and NF-κB activities and PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation in RSK1-transfected K562cells. After pretreatment of 40 μm PD98059 for 2 h, the parental and RSK1-transfected cells were treated with PMA for 1 h, and ERK (A), RSK1 (B), and NF-κB (C) activities were compared. For morphological and nonspecific esterase activity assays (D), the parental and RSK1-transfected cells were treated with 10 nm PMA after pretreatment of 40 μm PD98059 for 2 h. After 3 days cells in the culture dish were photographed for morphological assay (upper panels), and cytospin preparations were stained to examine nonspecific esterase activity (lower panels).

Consistent with the morphology and nonspecific esterase assay, overexpression of RSK1 enhanced the expression of CD41 induced by PMA (Fig. 7 B), while overexpression of RSK1 (D205N) suppressed the expression of CD41 (Fig. 7 C). Overexpression of IκBα (S32A/S36A) inhibited the expression of CD41 induced by PMA (Fig.7 D) and enhanced by overexpression of RSK1 (Fig.7 E). In addition, PMA-induced CD41 expression was prevented by the pretreatment with PD98059 in both parental and RSK1-transfected K562 cells (Fig. 7 F). Similar results were observed in CD61 expression (data not shown). These results confirmed that PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation is dependent on the ERK/RSK/NF-κB pathway.DISCUSSIONThe signaling mechanism that mediates the PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells is still controversial. We have proposed that PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells is dependent on the NF-κB pathway (8Kang C.D. Han C.S. Kim K.W. Do I.R. Kim C.M. Kim S.H. Lee E.Y. Chung B.S.

In this study, we have demonstrated that RSK1 plays a role bridging ERK and NF-κB pathways during the PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells.Since RSK is activated by ERK/MAPK (16Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar), RSK1 activity was assayed during PMA-induced differentiation of K562 cells. After treatment with PMA, a sustained activation of RSK1 was observed over at least 12 h with a 1-h peak time after stimulation. It has been shown that a sustained activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway is required for megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells (11Racke F.K. Lewandowska K. Goueli S. Goldfarb A.N. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1986486166,"We observed amino acid homology between the cysteine-rich N terminus of the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) ectodomain and epidermal growth factor-like repeats in the laminin γ1 chain. Thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies (TSAb), the cause of Graves' disease, interact with this region of the TSHR in a manner critically dependent on antigen conformation. We studied the role of the cluster of four cysteine (Cys) residues in this region of the TSHR on the functional response to TSAb in Graves' patients' sera. As a benchmark we also studied TSH binding and action. Removal in various permutations of the four cysteines at TSHR positions 24, 29, 31, and 41 (signal peptide residues are 1–21) revealed Cys41 to be the key residue for receptor expression. Forced pairing of Cys41 with any one of the three upstream Cys residues was necessary for trafficking to the cell surface of a TSHR with high affinity TSH binding similar to the wild-type receptor. However, for a full biological response to TSAb, forced pairing of Cys41 with Cys29 or with Cys31, but not with Cys24, retained functional activity comparable with the wild-type TSHR. These data suggest that an N-terminal disulfide-bonded loop between Cys41 and Cys29or its close neighbor Cys31 comprises, in part, the highly conformational epitope for TSAb at the critical N terminus of the TSHR. Amino acid homology, as well as cysteine pairing similar to the laminin γ1 chain epidermal growth factor-like repeat 11, suggests conformational similarity between the two molecules and raises the possibility of molecular mimicry in the pathogenesis of Graves' disease.

Chazenbalk G.D. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 673-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular interaction between TSHR autoantibodies and the TSHR is, therefore, important for advances in the diagnosis and therapy of Graves' disease, one of the most common organ-specific autoimmune diseases affecting humans. Studies of TSHR autoantibody-autoantigen interaction have been difficult because of the very low serum concentrations of the autoantibodies (2De Forteza R. Smith C.U. Amin J. McKenzie J.M. Zakarija M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 78: 1271-1273PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jaume J.C. Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and because of the highly conformational nature of their epitopes. Although the binding sites for TSHR autoantibodies and TSH involve discontinuous segments throughout the TSHR ectodomain (4Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Russo D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 5Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the N-terminal region of the ectodomain appears to be particularly important for the functional activity of TSHR autoantibodies (5Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 6Tahara K. Ban T. Minegishi T. Kohn L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Comparison of the primary amino acid sequences of the large ectodomains of the glycoprotein hormone receptors reveals a moderately conserved, central leucine-rich repeat region flanked by segments of much lower homology. The poorly conserved TSHR N-terminal region extends from amino acid residues 22 to 56 (the signal peptide being residues 1–21). This short (35-residue) region contains four of the eleven Cys residues (Cys24, Cys29, Cys31, and Cys41) in the large (397-residue) TSHR ectodomain, supporting the importance of secondary and tertiary structure in TSHR recognition by autoantibodies. Another indicator of the importance of conformation in the TSHR N terminus region is that TSHR autoantibodies and a mouse monoclonal antibody to this segment (3BD10; epitope within amino acid residues 25 to 51) interact reciprocally and exclusively with two different folded forms of the native molecule present in the same TSHR preparation (10Chazenbalk G.D. Wang Y. Guo J. Hutchison J.S. Segal D. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 702-710PubMed Google Scholar). A number of lines of evidence suggest that the four N-terminal cysteines form disulfide bonds with one another rather than with other Cys residues in the TSHR. First, from the current three-dimensional model of the TSHR leucine-rich repeat area (11Kajava A.V. Vassart G. Wodak S.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 867-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) based on the known structure of ribonuclease A inhibitor (12Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), the cluster of four N-terminal cysteine residues is well separated from the seven other cysteines in the TSHR ectodomain. The large size and relatively rigidity of the TSHR leucine-rich repeat segment makes it very unlikely that the N-terminal cysteine cluster can form disulfide bonds with their far downstream counterparts (reviewed in Ref. 1Rapoport B. Chazenbalk G.D. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 673-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Second, the N-terminal cysteine cluster cannot form disulfide bridges with either of two cysteines in extracellular loops 1 and 2, because the latter are highly conserved among G protein-coupled receptors and themselves form a disulfide bond (13Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 14Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le T., I Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5039) Google Scholar). Finally, and most important, reduction of disulfide bonds in the TSHR abolishes the conformational epitope of monoclonal antibody 3BD10 (see above), this epitope containing the four N-terminal cysteines. Of the four cysteines, Cys41 is of particular interest in that its substitution or deletion abolishes TSH and TSHR autoantibody binding to the surface of transfected cells (8Kosugi S. Ban T. Akamizu T. Kohn L.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 168-180PubMed Google Scholar,15Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Russo D. Rapoport B.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), reportedly without affecting trafficking and cell surface expression of the TSHR (17Kosugi S. Ban T. Akamizu T. Kohn L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992; 189: 1754-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). An apparent paradox, however, is that deletion or mutation of any of the potential partners of Cys41 (Cys24, Cys29, or Cys31) is reported to have no effect on ligand or autoantibody binding (8Kosugi S. Ban T. Akamizu T. Kohn L.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 168-180PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the role of disulfide bonding among the Cys residues at positions 24, 29, 31, and 41 on the expression of TSHR functional activity in terms of responsiveness to autoantibodies in Graves' patients' sera. In these studies, we were guided by novel observations on the structural relationship between the N terminus of the TSHR and cysteine-rich EGF-like repeats in laminin. Mutations (C24S, C29S, C31S, C41S, C24S,C29S, C24S,C31S, C29S,C31S, and C24S,C29S,C31S) and a deletion (amino acids 22–30) were created in the TSHR cDNA in the mammalian expression vector pECE-NEO (18Nagayama Y. Kaufman K.D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1989; 165: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene, San Diego, CA or, for the deletion, by the polymerase chain reaction using overlapping oligonucleotide primers and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Note that although we have previously generated a C41S TSHR mutant (16Wadsworth H.L. Russo D. Nagayama Y. Chazenbalk G.D. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), this mutation was in the 4-kilobase TSHR cDNA in which the 5′- and 3′-untranslated ends greatly reduce the level of TSHR expression (19Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G. Filetti S. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinol. 1996; 137: 2664-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All mutants in the present study were, therefore, created in the TSHR with 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions deleted (19Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G. Filetti S. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinol. 1996; 137: 2664-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of the mutations and surrounding regions were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Plasmids were stably transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (penicillin, 100 units/ml; gentamicin, 50 μg/ml; and amphotericin, 2.5 μg/ml). Selection was performed with 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies). Surviving clones (>100 per 100-mm diameter culture dish) were pooled and propagated for further study. Stably transfected CHO cells were grown to confluence in 24-well culture plates. Cells were then incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C in 250 μl of binding buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution with 280 mm sucrose substituting for NaCl to maintain isotonicity and 0.25% bovine serum albumin) containing ∼10,000 cpm 125I-TSH (kindly provided by B.R.A.H.M.S., Berlin, Germany) in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled bovine TSH (Sigma). The cells were rinsed carefully 3 times with prechilled binding buffer (4 °C), solubilized with 0.5 ml of 1 n NaOH, and radioactivity was measured in a gamma counter. TheKd values were calculated by Scatchard analysis (20Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17806) Google Scholar). Transfected CHO cells, grown to near confluence in 24-well plates, were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in Ham's F-12 medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine with or without added bovine TSH (Sigma). The medium was then aspirated, and intracellular cAMP was extracted with 95% ethanol, evaporated to dryness, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.2. After acetylation (20 μl of triethlamine and 10 μl of acetic anhydride) cAMP was measured by radioimmunoassay using cAMP, 2′-O-succinyl-[125I]iodotyrosine methyl ester (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and a rabbit anti-cAMP antibody (Fitzgerald, Concord, MA). Crude IgG fractions of sera from patients with Graves' disease were precipitated with polyethylene glycol 4,000 and resuspended in modified Hanks' buffer lacking NaCl (21Kasagi K. Konishi J. Iida Y. Ikekubo K. Mori T. Kuma K. Torizuka K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1982; 54: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 0.3% bovine serum albumin. Transfected CHO cells, grown to confluence in 96-well plates, were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in this buffer containing patients' IgG. The plates were then frozen for 1 h at −80 °C (without aspirating the medium), thawed, and total (intracellular and released) cAMP was measured by radioimmunoassay as described above. Intact CHO cells transfected with the wild-type and mutated TSHR were harvested from 10-cm diameter dishes using 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2% fetal bovine serum, and 0.05% NaN3, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in 100 μl of the same buffer containing 1 μg of mouse monoclonal antibody 2C11 to the TSHR ectodomain (Serotec, Oxford, United Kingdom) (22Johnstone A.P. Cridland J.C. DaCosta C.R. Harfst E. Shepherd P.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 105: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As a negative control, cells were incubated in 100 μl of normal mouse sera (1:100). After rinsing, the cells were incubated for 45 min with 100 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100) (Caltag, Burlingame, CA), washed, and analyzed using a Beckman FACScan flow cytofluorimeter. Cells stained with propidium iodide (1 μg/ml final concentration) were excluded from analysis. For selected TSHR mutants, intracellular receptors were also detected in permeabilized cells. For this purpose, before adding the 2C11 monoclonal antibody, the cells were first fixed for 10 min in chilled 1% paraformaldehyde, resuspended in saponin buffer (0.01 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, NaN3, and 0.1% saponin; Sigma). The cells were then processed as described above except that they were rinsed in buffer containing saponin and incubated for 45 min with the goat anti-mouse IgG in saponin buffer. The N-terminal region of the TSHR upstream of the leucine-rich repeats bears little homology to the other members of the glycoprotein hormone receptor family. However, we searched the protein data bases for homology with other, unrelated proteins. Not recognized previously, homology was found between TSHR amino acid residues 23–43 and amino acid residues 979–997 of the human laminin γ1 chain (23Fukushima Y. Pikkarainen T. Kallunki T. Eddy R.L. Byers M.G. Haley L.L. Henry W.M. Tryggvason K. Shows T.B. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1988; 48: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (accession number 126369). Of 21 TSHR amino acid residues, 10 are identical, and 2 are conserved (Fig.1 A). The corresponding region of the laminin γ1 chain contains the C terminus of EGF-like repeat 10 and the N terminus of EGF-like repeat 11. From the known three-dimensional structure of EGF-like repeats in other regions of the laminin molecule (24Stetefeld J. Mayer U. Timpl R. Huber R. J. Mol.

Biol. 1996; 257: 658-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the critical conformational structure of the TSHR N-terminal region interaction with autoantibodies was unlikely to involve Cys24 but was more likely to involve disulfide bonding between Cys41 and Cys29 or, alternatively, between Cys41 and Cys31 (Fig. 1 B). As mentioned above, this region of the TSHR contains the epitope for a mouse monoclonal antibody (3BD10). However, in a purified, native TSHR ectodomain preparation, this epitope is only present in molecules not recognized by human autoantibodies. Conversely, an alternatively folded form of the molecule in the same preparation only interacts with human autoantibodies and not with mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3BD10 (10Chazenbalk G.D. Wang Y. Guo J. Hutchison J.S. Segal D. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 702-710PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, considered that these reciprocal interactions could be explained by conformational differences resulting from altered disulfide bonding (Fig. 1 B). To understand better the role in receptor conformation of two putative disulfide bonds among the four Cys residues in the TSHR N terminus, we substituted or deleted these Cys residues in different permutations (Fig.2). The rationale for these mutations was that removal of either cysteine in a linked pair should produce the same “phenotype,” either altered or unchanged ligand and antibody binding. As observed previously (8Kosugi S. Ban T. Akamizu T. Kohn L.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 168-180PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wadsworth H.L. Russo D. Nagayama Y. Chazenbalk G.D. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), replacement of Cys41 totally abolished TSH binding to intact cells stably transfected with the mutant receptor (TableI). However, against the expectation that mutation of a cysteine coupled with Cys41 should also lead to a defective receptor, the individual substitutions of Cys24, Cys29, and Cys31 were all associated with high affinity TSH binding (Kd range of 1.5–3.6 × 10−10m) (Table I).Table ITSH binding affinity and TSHR level of expression for stably transfected cell linesTSH receptorTSH bindingKd (m)TSHR number (fmol/mg of cell protein)Mean ± S.D.aValues represent the mean ± S.D. of two or three experiments, with duplicate wells at each TSH concentration.

Open table in a new tab In a second series of mutations guided by homology with the laminin EGF-like domains (Fig. 1 B), we replaced or deleted multiple pairs of Cys residues in the TSHR N terminus not involving Cys41, as well as all three cysteines other than Cys41 (Table I). Paired replacements of Cys24and Cys31 and Cys29 and Cys31, as well as deletion of residues 22–30 (which includes Cys24and Cys29), also did not prevent the cell surface expression of TSHR capable of high affinity TSH binding (Table I). On the other hand, the simultaneous replacement of Cys24, Cys29, and Cys31 produced a TSHR that bound very poorly to TSH at a level too low to determine affinity. The cAMP response of the TSHR mutants to TSH stimulation was consistent with the TSH binding data. All mutants responded vigorously to TSH with the exceptions of those with the C41S and the triple (C24S,C29S,C31S) substitutions that had very small responses (Fig.3). Previously, it was reported that the TSHR with a C41S substitution expressed normally on the cell surface (17Kosugi S. Ban T. Akamizu T. Kohn L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992; 189: 1754-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because of the important implications of this observation on the role of Cys41 in the TSH binding site, we examined cell surface expression of the TSHR N-terminal cysteine mutants independent of ligand binding. For this purpose we performed flow cytometry on stably transfected CHO cells using a mouse mAb (2C11) to a distal region of the molecule (22Johnstone A.P. Cridland J.C. DaCosta C.R. Harfst E. Shepherd P.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 105: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Van Sande J. Massart C. Costagliola S. Allgeier A. Cetani F. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 119: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Consistent with the TSH binding and functional data (see Table I and Fig. 3), cell surface expression was comparable for the wild-type TSHR and all mutant receptors except for those with the C41S and the combined C24S, C29S, and C31S substitutions (Fig.4). Flow cytometry with mAb 2C11 on permeabilized cells revealed levels of TSHR expression in these two mutants similar to that of the wild-type TSHR (Fig.5, clear histograms). Therefore, absent or minimal cell surface expression of TSHR with the C41S and the combined C24S, C29S, and C31S replacements was the result of faulty trafficking rather than of a diminished level of expression.Figure 5Flow cytometric detection of TSHR in permeabilized, stably transfected CHO cells. Untransfected cells (black histograms) and cells expressing either the wild-type (WT) TSHR or the indicated TSHR mutants (overlapping clear histograms) were pre-treated with saponin (see “Materials and Methods”), thereby allowing detection of intracellular TSHR. TSHR-C24S,C29S,C31S and TSHR-C41S, which have absent or minimal cell surface expression, are clearly expressed intracellularly to a similar degree as the wild-type TSHR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mouse mAb 3BD10, whose epitope includes the N-terminal region with the Cys residue cluster, was generated by immunization with a soluble, truncated TSHR ectodomain (10Chazenbalk G.D. Wang Y. Guo J. Hutchison J.S. Segal D. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 702-710PubMed Google Scholar). As described above, this molecule exists in two folded forms, with 3BD10 recognizing only the form that is not bound by TSHR autoantibodies (and vice versa). 3BD10 does not bind to the full-length TSHR expressed on the cell surface (27Chazenbalk G.D. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18959-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Two possible reasons for this phenomenon are as follows: (i) the 3BD10 epitope is sterically inaccessible with the membrane-associated TSHR, and (ii) the 3BD10 epitope on the membrane-associated TSHR is in the form recognized only by autoantibodies. In the latter case, it was possible that rearrangement of disulfide bonds could restore recognition by 3BD10 of TSHR on the cell surface. For example, removal of Cys29 could force formation of a Cys41-Cys31 bond, or removal of Cys31 could force formation of a Cys41-Cys29 bond (Fig. 1 B). However, on flow cytometry, 3BD10 recognition of cell surface TSHR did not emerge with any of the cysteine variants in the receptor N terminus (data not shown). These data favor the alternative that the 3BD10 epitope is obscured in the cell-surface TSHR. Finally, we explored the effect of mutations in the TSHR N-terminal cysteine cluster on autoantibody activation of the TSHR. With the exception of a few uniquely potent sera, serum TSHR autoantibodies cannot be detected by flow cytometry because of their extremely low level in serum, and because the TSHR is “sticky” and produces an elevated background even with sera from normal individuals lacking TSHR autoantibodies (3Jaume J.C. Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). On the other hand, TSAb to the TSHR can be detected in the majority of Graves' sera by their ability to activate the TSHR with consequent cAMP generation. The functional activity of panels of Graves' sera was tested on the mutant TSHR and compared with the activity of the same sera on the wild-type TSHR. More than one panel of Graves' sera was required, because insufficient volumes were available to test all TSHR mutants with the same sera. Three patterns of response were observed with cells expressing the N-terminal cysteine mutants. First, consistent with absent or poor cell-surface expression of TSHR mutants C41S and C24S,C29S,C31S, TSAb activity was not detected when Graves' IgG were incubated with cell lines stably transfected with these receptors (Fig.6, A and B). Second, and conversely, TSAb activity with cells expressing C24S and C24S,C31S was comparable with values obtained with the wild-type TSHR. In a third pattern, TSHR-C29S, TSHR-C31S, and TSHR-C29S,C31S, as well as the receptor lacking Cys24 and Cys29, elicited cAMP responses lower than those observed with the wild-type TSHR. TSHR lacking Cys24 and Cys29 has the N-terminal 9 amino acids deleted (residues 22–30, the signal peptide being residues 1–21). We initially performed this deletion because of a previous report that this region could be deleted without affecting the response to TSHR autoantibodies (8Kosugi S. Ban T. Akamizu T. Kohn L.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 168-180PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was possible that the deletion altered the TSHR autoantibody epitope(s) independent of the presence or absence of disulfide bonds involving Cys residues within the region. We, therefore, generated a TSHR mutant C24S,C29S in which only these two residues were involved. The level of expression of this receptor on the cell surface was similar to that of the wild-type TSHR on flow cytometry with monoclonal antibody 2C11 (data not shown), as was its affinity for TSH (4 × 10−10m). Indeed, with TSHR-C24S,C29S (unlike with the TSHR with residues 22–30 deleted) the cAMP response to TSHR autoantibodies was not reduced relative to that with the wild-type TSHR (Fig. 6 C). The cysteine-rich N terminus of the TSHR (amino acid residues 22–57, upstream of the leucine rich repeats) is an important component of the epitope for thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies that cause Graves' disease (reviewed in Ref. 1Rapoport B. Chazenbalk G.D. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 673-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The structural segregation of the four N-terminal Cys residues from the other seven Cys residues in the ectodomain suggested that any disulfide bonds involving the four upstream cysteines were among themselves (see Fig. 4 in Ref. 1Rapoport B. Chazenbalk G.D. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 673-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Proof of at least one disulfide bond involving the four N-terminal cysteines was obtained with mouse mAb 3BD10, which has a conformational epitope encompassing residues 25–51 in the TSHR N terminus (10Chazenbalk G.D. Wang Y. Guo J. Hutchison J.S. Segal D. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 702-710PubMed Google Scholar). Our present evidence that disulfide bonding between TSHR Cys41 and either Cys29 or Cys31 (but not Cys24) is important for TSHR autoantibody function is consistent with the known three-dimensional structure of cysteine-rich EGF-like repeats in the laminin γ1 chain (24Stetefeld J. Mayer U. Timpl R. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 644-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25Baumgartner R. Czisch M. Mayer U. Poschl E. Huber R. Timpl R. Holak T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 658-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Remarkable homology exists between TSHR amino acid residues 23–43 and this region of EGF (10 identical and 2 conserved amino acids). The ability of two different ligands (TSH and TSHR autoantibodies) to activate the same receptor provides a powerful and necessary control for interpreting mutations introduced into the TSHR. Regarding TSH binding and action, TSHR amino acid Cys41 is the key cysteine in that it is the only one in the cluster of four whose mutation alters TSH binding. In principle, removal of the cysteine paired with Cys41 should produce a similar phenotype. However, only the simultaneous mutation of all three potential Cys41 partners reproduces the C41S phenotype. These surprising data indicate that Cys41 has the option of pairing with any one of Cys24, Cys29, or Cys31 and still producing a functional receptor with high affinity TSH binding. Moreover, our data do not support the previous concept that mutation of Cys41 is compatible with normal TSHR trafficking and expression on the cell surface (8Kosugi S. Ban T. Akamizu T. Kohn L.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 168-180PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kosugi S. Ban T. Akamizu T. Kohn L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992; 189: 1754-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To the contrary, neither TSHR-C41S nor TSHR-C24S,C29S,C31S (its phenotypic pair) reaches the cell surface, thereby explaining the lack of TSH binding and TSH functional activity. On the other hand, TSHR cell surface expression appears to be dependent on a disulfide-bonded loop in the TSHR N-terminal region. Examination of TSH binding to the mutant TSHR retained within the cell would be of interest. However, it is not possible to detect intracellular TSH ligand binding even to the wild-type TSHR. Regarding TSAb functional activity (the affinity or binding of these autoantibodies cannot be measured), most informative were the three double cysteine mutations not involving Cys41(TSHR-C24S,C29S, TSHR-C24S,C31S, and TSHR-C29S, C31S). Mutation of each of these cysteine pairs would force Cys41 to couple with Cys31, Cys29, or Cys24, respectively, to form the N-terminal loop necessary for TSHR cell surface expression. All retained high affinity TSH binding and function similar to the wild-type TSHR, yet only TSHR-C29S,C31S displayed a reduced TSAb response relative to the wild-type receptor. These data suggest that Cys41 can pair with either Cys29or its close neighbor Cys31 to provide the optimal conformation for the TSAb epitope (Fig. 1 B). These results, as well as the lack of effect of the single Cys24 mutation, are also consistent with the homology comparison with laminin suggesting that TSHR Cys24 is part of a separate domain. Reduced TSAb responses in TSHR with single substitutions at Cys29 or Cys31 are difficult to explain. In principle, such single mutations would permit Cys41 pairing with either Cys31 or Cys29, respectively, without impairing TSAb function. It is possible that conformational changes and an odd number (three) of remaining Cys residues may lead to abnormal disulfide bonding, such as Cys41-Cys24. An interesting comparison with the present data is provided by previous evidence obtained with chimeric lutropin-TSHR receptors. A chimeric substitution of TSHR amino acid residues 25–30 (SSPPCE) with the homologous residues of lutropin (PEPCD) also attenuated TSAb activity despite a normal TSH response (28Seto P. Nagayama Y. Foti D. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 94: 5-8Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) but with one interesting difference. In the chimeric receptor study, the diminished response was observed only with half of the 10 Graves' sera whereas in the present study, the response was diminished in all sera tested. One possible reason for this difference is that, in the chimeric receptor study, TSHR residue Cys29 is retained, because it is conserved within the lutropin receptor. However, the altered proline alignment (including a gap of one amino acid residue) suggests a significant conformational difference between this region of the two receptors. These data support the notion that the amino acids adjacent to Cys29 contribute to this component of the TSAb epitope, as does the present finding of reduced TSAb activity in the TSHR with amino acid residues 22–30 deleted. Regarding mouse mAb 3BD10, our hypothesis that the exclusive and reciprocal interaction between it and TSHR autoantibodies was consequent to alternative (e.g. Cys41-Cys29 and Cys41-Cys31) disulfide bonding was not confirmed. 3BD10 recognized none of the TSHR mutants created in the present study. However, although not confirmed, neither can the hypothesis be excluded. 3BD10 was generated against a secreted form of truncated TSHR ectodomain, and this antibody does not recognize the wild-type, membrane-associated TSHR. It is possible that its epitope, available on a soluble TSHR fragment, is inaccessible because of steric hindrance caused by the relationship of the TSHR ectodomain to the plasma membrane. Finally, besides homology with a module in laminin, striking homology (8/11 amino acids identical, 2 conserved) also exists between residues 23–33 (GCSSPPCECGQ) in the critical TSHR N-terminal region and residues 1103–1113 of host cell factor (GCSNPPCETHE; accession numberP51610), a protein that interacts with a Herpes simplex virus protein upon lytic infection of permissive cells. Further studies are necessary to investigate the possibility of cross-reactivity with laminin or with other as yet unrecognized antigens, including infectious organisms (reviewed in Ref. 29Tomer Y. Davies T.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 107-120PubMed Google Scholar), in the pathogenesis of Graves' disease.

Although a great deal is known about p300/CBP as transcriptional regulators, very little information is available about mechanisms that regulate their transcriptional activity. Several lines of evidence suggest that phosphorylation may regulate p300/CBP activity. First, p300/CBP have been shown to be phosphoproteins whose phosphorylation state alters during F9 cell differentiation and in adenovirus infection (24Kitabayashi I. Eckner R. Arany Z. Chiu R. Gachelin G. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3496-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Second, kinases such as protein kinase A and mitogen-activated kinases have been shown to activate CBP-mediated transcription (25Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar,26Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Third, p300 has been reported to be phosphorylated in vitro by cyclin-dependent kinases such as cdc2 and cdk2 (27Barbeau D. Charbonneau R. Whalen S.G. Bayley S.T. Branton P.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 359-373PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we provide evidence that the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) stimulates p300-mediated transcription in vivo in a manner that is independent of its downstream kinase JNK. MEKK1 is a 196-kDa protein which, when cleaved by caspases in response to genotoxic agents, is capable of inducing apoptosis (28Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 29Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). MEKK1 propagates the signal by activating its downstream kinase, MKK4, which in turn activates JNK (30Sanchez I. Hughes R.T.

Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Activated JNK translocates into the nucleus where it modifies the activity of transcription factors such as AP-1 (32Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2953) Google Scholar, 33Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar). MEKK1 has also been shown to activate NFκB- and c-Myc-mediated transcription, the former involving the activation of the IκBα kinase (34Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). We find that the activated MEKK1 can significantly increase GAL4-p300-mediated transcription. Consistently, nocodazole, which is an extracellular stimulus of MEKK1 (35Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 36Xia Y. Makris C. Su B. Li E. Yang J. Nemerow G.R. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5243-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), can also stimulate p300-dependent transcription. Interestingly, this activation appears to be independent of the downstream kinase JNK since a dominant negative JNK fails to abrogate MEKK1-induced, p300-mediated transcription. In addition, mutations of all the possible JNK sites within subdomains of p300 responsive to MEKK1 had no effect on their response to MEKK1. Although the mechanisms by which MEKK1 induces p300-mediated transcription are still unclear, one possible scenario is a direct phosphorylation of p300 by MEKK1. Consistent with this possibility, we find that MEKK1 can robustly phosphorylate p300 directly in vitro. Significantly, we also find that the activated form of MEKK1 is present exclusively in the nucleus, overlapping with the endogenous p300. In addition, we find the transfected inactive MEKK1 in the cytoplasm, and it appears to localize some of the p300 proteins to the punctate MEKK1 signals. Finally, our results also show that MEKK1-induced apoptosis is impaired by the inhibition of p300 expression. Taken together, our results suggest that phosphorylation of p300 induced by MEKK1 modifies its transcriptional activity, which may be an important event in the apoptosis induced by MEKK1. HeLa, U2OS, and MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. pGAL4-p300 aa 1–596, pGAL4-p300 aa 744–1571, and pGAL4-p300 aa 1257–2414 were described before (22Lee J.-S. Zhang X. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17666-17674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). pGAL4-Sp1Q2 was obtained from Robert Tjian (University of California, Berkeley). p12SE1A expression plasmid was described previously (37Lee J.-S. Galvin K.M. See R.H. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Shi Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1188-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). pGAL4-p300 aa 19–2414, pGAL4-p300 aa 1737–2414, and pGAL4-p300 aa 1945–2414 were kindly provided by Antonio Giordano (Jefferson Cancer Institute, Philadelphia, PA). pCDNA3-FLAG MEKK1Δ and pCDNA3-FLAG MEKK1Δ (K432M), consisting of the C-terminal 321 residues of full-length MEKK1, were obtained from Tom Maniatis (Harvard University, Boston). pCDNA3 HA-tagged JNK (APF) was obtained from Tilang Deng (University of Florida, Gainesville). GAL4-cJun aa 1–223 and GAL4-luciferase were gifts from Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego). GST-p300 aa 1709–1913 was provided by David Livingston (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). pGAL4-p300 aa 302–667 was constructed by subcloning the region in frame with PSG 424 GAL4 expression vector. GST-p300 aa 2–337 and GST-p300 aa 302–667 were made by subcloning the corresponding regions into a compatible pGEX vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to create an in-frame fusion. GAL4-p300 aa 302–667 Ala-317/499/512/524/594 and GAL4-p300 aa 1709–1913 Ala-1726/1849/1851/1854/1857/1865/1868/1878/1906/1909 were created by mutation of serines and threonines to alanines using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were verified by sequencing. GST-p300 alanine mutants were constructed by cloning the regions into a compatible pGEX vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to create an in-frame fusion. HeLa cells were transfected using Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with indicated reporters and cDNA expression vectors. After 40 h, luciferase activity was determined as described (38Ronco L.V. Karpova A.Y. Vidal M. Howley P.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2061-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of %-galactosidase activity of cotransfected Rous sarcoma virus %-galactosidase vector. U2OS cells were transfected with mammalian expression plasmids encoding either GAL4 DNA-binding domain (G4, 1 μg) alone or G4-p300 (1 μg) together with the target reporter G4-luciferase (0.5 μg). One hour before harvest, the cells were treated with two different doses (0.5 and 1.0 μg/ml) of nocodazole. Cell extracts were prepared and used for luciferase assay described above. GST-p300 fusion proteins were induced and purified as described (34Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). His6 MEKK1Δ was purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cell lysates using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose as described previously (34Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). About 5 μg of purified GST fusion proteins were suspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated with either 0.5 μg of His6 MEKK1Δ or 1 μg of recombinant JNK (Stratagene) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 30 min. The kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved using 12% SDS-PAGE gels and dried for autoradiography. Nocodazole stimulation of MEKK1 kinase activity was measured by the activation of JNK. Briefly, proliferating U20S cells were treated with either Me2SO solvent control or nocodazole at the indicated concentrations. Cell lysates were prepared 1 h post-treatment, and the activation of MEKK1 was analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-JNK1 antibody (SC-474, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described previously (39See R.H. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4012-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Apoptosis assays were performed using MCF-7 cells that express either an active p300 or inactive p300 ribozymes as described previously (40Yuan Z.-M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Utsugisawa T. Shioya H. Utsugisawa Y. Yokoyama K. Weichselbaum R. Shi Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1883-1886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Activated MEKK1 was cotransfected into MCF-7 cells along with green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA. Apoptotic cells were scored on the basis of GFP and Hoecht stain 48 h after transfection. U2OS cells were transiently transfected with full-length HA-MEKK1 or FLAG-MEKK1Δ cDNA. Thirty six hours post-transfection, the cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde at 25 °C for 10 min. After 5 min of washing in PBS, the fixed cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X- 100 (25 °C for 15 min) followed by 5 min of washing in PBS. The cells were then incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at 25 °C. Anti-HA epitope tag monoclonal antibody (Babco) and anti-FLAG epitope tag monoclonal antibody (Sigma) were used at a 1:200 dilution; anti-p300 polyclonal antibody C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was diluted 1:100. After three 10-min PBS washes, coverslips were incubated in secondary antibody for 1 h at 25 °C. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Cy3 Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch) secondary antibody were used at a dilution of 1:400. For the DAPI staining, the coverslips were also incubated in 1× PBS with 1:10,000 dilution of DAPI for 10 min. Vectashield 1200 media was used for slide mounting (Vector Labs). Epifluorescence microscopy was conducted using a Nikon microscope. Images were acquired by a Sony camera and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop version 5.0. To determine whether MEKK1 affects p300-mediated transcription, a constitutively activated MEKK1 mutant, MEKK1Δ (34Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), was cotransfected into HeLa cells along with GAL4-p300 and a GAL4 luciferase reporter construct. Fig. 1 A shows that MEKK1Δ augmented GAL4-p300-mediated transcription about 20-fold compared with vector control. In contrast, a catalytically inactive mutant of MEKK1, MEKK1Δ K432M (lysine 432 converted to methionine), had little effect on GAL4-p300-mediated transcription (Fig.1 B). This indicates that stimulation of p300-mediated transcription by MEKK1 is dependent on the kinase activity of MEKK1. Furthermore, MEKK1Δ did not affect transcription mediated by GAL4-Sp1Q2 (Fig. 1 A), a previously characterized glutamine-rich activation domain of Sp1, suggesting that the ability of MEKK1Δ to up-regulate p300-mediated transcription was not through a general enhancement of the basal transcription machinery. The ability of MEKK1Δ to activate GAL4-p300-mediated transcription was not restricted to HeLa cells as similar results were obtained in COS-7 cells (data not shown). These findings suggest that a kinase pathway involving MEKK1 can regulate GAL4-p300-mediated transcription. To determine whether extracellular stimuli known to activate MEKK1 can stimulate p300-dependent transcription, we examined the ability of nocodazole (35Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 36Xia Y. Makris C. Su B. Li E. Yang J. Nemerow G.R. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5243-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) to regulate GAL4-p300-mediated transcription. As shown in Fig.2 A, MEKK1 kinase activity is stimulated by nocodazole in a dose-dependent manner as shown by its ability to induce JNK phosphorylation (compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 1). When the kinase activity of MEKK1 is stimulated, we find consistent enhancement of GAL4-p300-mediated transcription by nocodazole in a dose-dependent manner, although at a modest level (Fig.2 B, lanes 5 and 6). Taken together, activated MEKK1 provided either exogenously (transfection) or endogenously (conversion of an inactive MEKK1 to an active one by nocodazole) can stimulate GAL4-p300-mediated transcription. Previously, we and others (21Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9009-9013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 22Lee J.-S. Zhang X. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17666-17674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have shown that at least two independent activation domains are present in the N- and C-terminal portions of p300. We wished to determine whether the transcriptional activity of these two p300 domains could be regulated by MEKK1Δ. Fig.3 shows that the transcriptional activity of the N-terminal (aa 1–596) and the C-terminal regions (aa 1257–2414), when fused to GAL4, were highly responsive to MEKK1Δ. In contrast, the middle region of p300 (aa 744–1571), which itself has no detectable transcriptional activity (22Lee J.-S. Zhang X. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17666-17674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), did not respond at all to MEKK1Δ. We next sought to identify a minimal domain within the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of p300 that were responsible for the transcriptional activation by MEKK1Δ. As shown in Fig. 3, the response of the large N-terminal region of p300 to MEKK1Δ was mediated by two subdomains, aa 2–337 (N1, 32-fold) and aa 302–667 (N2, 89-fold) The N2 subdomain contains the C/H1 domain (aa 347–411) and is three times more responsive than N1. Further deletions that remove aa 302–406 (inclusive of the C/H1 domain) and aa 567–667 from N2 did not significantly reduce its response to MEKK1, suggesting that p300 aa 407–566 (N3) is sufficient to mediate part of the response of p300 to MEKK1Δ. Taken together, these results suggest that there are at least two transactivation domains within the N terminus that are responsive to MEKK1Δ, p300 aa 2–337 and p300 aa 407–566, and that the C/H1 domain is not involved in the N-terminal response of p300 to MEKK1Δ. The C-terminal deletion mutants of p300 were also analyzed for the same purpose. Fig. 3 shows that MEKK1Δ enhanced the transcriptional activity of GAL4-p300 (aa 1737–2414) (C1) 32-fold. In contrast, MEKK1Δ only weakly activated the transcriptional activity of GAL4-p300 (aa 1945–2414) (C2). These results suggest that p300 aa 1737–1945 is an important domain within the C-terminal half of p300 for responding to MEKK1Δ. Amino acids 1737–1945 of p300 contain the carboxyl portion of the C/H3 domain (aa 1653–1817) that is rich in cysteines and histidines (12Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. D. M. L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). The C/H3 domain has been shown to be an important surface that mediates a number of important protein-protein interactions (12Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. D. M. L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 21Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol.

Science. 1998; 279: 700-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The above data suggest that the C-terminal domain of p300 that mediates the response to MEKK1 may reside somewhere between aa 1737 and 1945. We therefore tested a GAL4-p300 construct that includes this region (GAL4-p300 aa 1709–1913) (C3). As shown in Fig. 3, MEKK1Δ activates transcription mediated by GAL4-p300 C3 (aa 1709–1913) by 20-fold. This is a significant transcriptional induction, although slightly less than the fold of activation (32-fold) observed for GAL4-p300 C1 (aa 1737- 2414) in response to MEKK1Δ. Thus, a region including part of the C/H3 domain of p300 is involved in the transcriptional response of the C-terminal region of p300 to MEKK1Δ. It has been well documented that MEKK1 activates the JNK family members of kinases (30Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 31Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J.

Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). To determine whether JNK1 was involved in the activation of GAL4-p300-mediated transcription induced by MEKK1, we first asked whether JNK is necessary for the MEKK1 response mediated by the subdomains of p300 described above. We tested a dominant negative inhibitor of JNK1 (JNK1 APF) (32Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2953) Google Scholar) for its ability to block MEKK1Δ-mediated activation of GAL4-p300-mediated transcription. As shown in Fig. 4, JNK1 (APF) was unable to block MEKK1Δ induction of transcription by either GAL4-p300N1 (aa 2–337), GAL4-p300N2 (aa 302–667), or GAL4-p300C1 (aa 1737–2414). In contrast, the dominant negative JNK1 mutant APF potently inhibited GAL4-cJun-mediated transcription 8-fold as expected (Fig. 4). These finding therefore suggest that JNK is not necessary for MEKK1 to enhance p300-mediated transcription. MEKK1 has also been shown to activate the IκBα kinases (34Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). By using a dominant negative form of the IκBα kinase (S32A/S36A), we found no evidence that this kinase is involved in mediating the ability of MEKK1Δ to enhance p300-mediated transcription (data not shown). The above results predict that these subdomains of p300 are either not substrates for JNK1, or the JNK phosphorylation sites residing in these subdomains are not important for MEKK1-induced, p300-mediated transcription. To determine whether JNK1 can phosphorylate the MEKK1-responsive p300 subdomains, we performed in vitrokinase assays using the various p300 domains fused to GST as substrates for recombinant JNK. Equal amounts of GST proteins were used for thein vitro kinase assays (data not shown). Fig.5 shows that recombinant JNK phosphorylates GST-p300 aa 1709–1913 (C3) very strongly (lane 4). In contrast, recombinant JNK barely phosphorylated GST-p300 aa 2–337 or GST-p300 aa 302–667 (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and3). Similar results were found in JNK immune complex kinase assays using the same GST-p300 substrates (data not shown). These results indicate that only the C3 domain of p300 was a potential substrate for JNK, whereas the N-terminal domains were not. The fact that the N-terminal domains of p300 are poor JNK substrates is consistent with the above finding (Fig. 5) that JNK is not involved in MEKK1-induced transcription mediated by the N-terminal domains of p300. The finding that JNK phosphorylates GST-p300 aa 1709–1913, which can also mediate a MEKK1 response, appears to be contradictory to the observation that the p300 C-terminal domain-mediated MEKK1 response is unaffected by a dominant negative form of JNK (Fig. 4). To resolve this issue, we determined whether JNK phosphorylation of this domain is correlated with its ability to mediate a MEKK1 response. We therefore mutated all potential JNK sites with the consensus sequence serine/proline or threonine/proline within this domain. Because of the large number of proline-directed serines and threonines within this region, we made a series of cluster mutations designatedA–D shown in Fig.6 A. Equal amounts of the mutant GST fusion proteins (Fig. 6 C) were then tested for their ability to be phosphorylated by recombinant JNK. Fig.6 B shows that compared with wild-type p300 aa 1709–1913, mutation of proline-directed serines a"

In our previous studies we found increased expression of LAT1 in primary human cancers. We have demonstrated also that LAT1 response to arginine availability is lost in transformed and tumorigenic cells such that expression is constitutively high. System l-amino acid transport activity correlates with changes in LAT1. To assess the functional relevance of increased LAT1 expression and the requirement for 4F2 heavy chain, we overexpressed these CD98 subunits together and separately in nontransformed hepatocytes and fibroblasts. Antigen tags in the expression constructs confirmed that expressed proteins were localized to both cytoplasmic and plasma membrane locations within the cells. Overexpression of LAT1 alone in mouse hepatocytes, but not fibroblasts, was sufficient to increase system l transport, and these cells displayed a growth advantage in conditions of limited arginine. Our results suggest that loss of regulation leading to constitutive expression of LAT1 can contribute to oncogenesis. We hypothesize that the altered LAT1 expression observed in hepatocarcinogenesis gives cells a growth or survival advantage through increased transport activity in a tumor microenvironment of limited amino acid availability. l-amino acid transporter-1 (LAT1) is a highly conserved gene identified as a light chain of the CD98 amino acid transporter and cellular activation marker.

We have found increased levels of LAT1 mRNA in both rat and human carcinomas and in the carbon tetrachloride model of liver injury/regeneration (7Sang J. Lim Y.-P. Panzica M. Finch P. Thompson N.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1152-1159PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wolf D.A. Wang S. Panzica M.A. Bassily N.H. Thompson N.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5012-5022PubMed Google Scholar, 23Shultz V.D. Degli Esposti S.

Adaptive regulation of message for LAT1 but not 4F2hc was observed in response to arginine levels in normal hepatic cells (25Campbell W.A. Sah D.E. Medina M.M. Albina J.E. Coleman W.B. Thompson N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5347-5354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Loss of LAT1 regulation with corresponding increased system l transport was associated with malignant progression, suggesting that up-regulation of LAT1 or functional CD98 complex contributes to the neoplastic phenotype. Hara et al.(26Hara K. Kudoh H. Enomoto T. Hashimoto Y. Masuko T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have shown that NIH3T3 cells transfected to overexpress 4F2hc demonstrated classic properties of malignant cells including higher saturation density, growth in soft agar, and tumor formation in athymic mice. Researchers from the same laboratory demonstrated more recently that transformation of BALB3T3 cells by overexpression of 4F2hc requires its association with an unidentified light chain (27Shishido T. Uno S. Kamohara M. Tsuneoka-Suzuki T. Hashimoto Y. Enomoto T. Masuko T. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We are interested in the regulation and role of LAT1 and CD98-related molecules in transformation and carcinogenesis. To examine the relationship of cell type to overexpression of these molecules and associated transport properties, we transiently overexpressed LAT1 and 4F2hc alone or together in nontransformed mouse hepatocyte and fibroblast cell lines. We found that overexpression of LAT1 alone was sufficient to increase system l transport activity significantly in the epithelial cells but not in the fibroblasts. In contrast, increases in transport activity in fibroblasts required coexpression of both LAT1 and 4F2hc. Hepatic cells overexpressing LAT1 displayed a growth advantage relative to control cells under conditions of limited arginine. We postulate that differences in LAT1 expression and response to amino acid availability influence cell growth and survival properties and that the LAT1-CD98 pathway may represent a unique therapeutic target for cancer intervention. AML12 cells, a normal mouse hepatocyte line, were provided kindly by Dr. Nelson Fausto (Department of Pathology, University of Washington) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with insulin, transferrin, and selenium (ITS+) at 1 ml/liter medium (Becton Dickinson) and 0.1 μm dexamethasone. NIH3T3 cells were cultured routinely in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. A custom formulation of Chee's essential medium (CEM)1 that was demonstrated to maintain long term differentiated cell functionin vitro was provided kindly by Dr. Hugo Jauregui (Department of Pathology, Rhode Island Hospital) and prepared as described previously (28Waxman D.J. Morrissey J. Naik S. Jauregui H. Biochemistry. 1990; 271: 113-119Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Arginine was not present in this custom formulation and was added from stock solutions. For experiments in which gene expression was assayed as a function of arginine availability, cells were seeded into T-75 flasks with CEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum with and without arginine (25Campbell W.A. Sah D.E. Medina M.M. Albina J.E. Coleman W.B. Thompson N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5347-5354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Previous experiments have shown no difference in results with dialyzed or nondialyzed serum (25Campbell W.A. Sah D.E. Medina M.M. Albina J.E. Coleman W.B. Thompson N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5347-5354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Medium was changed every day. Viability was at least 90% in all cases. Rat LAT1 cDNA was subcloned into the pFLAG-5a expression vector (Sigma) and sequenced to confirm the correct sequence and the addition of the FLAG epitope tag. pL(CD98-HA)IZ expression construct and monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Babco) were provided kindly by Dr. Tatiana Kolesnikova and Dr. Martin Hemler (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School). pL(CD98-HA)IZ expresses human 4F2hc/CD98 heavy chain with a hemagglutinin epitope tag. pEGFP-F (CLONTECH) encodes farnesylated enhanced green fluorescent protein. For transport assays, AML12 cells and NIH3T3 cells were seeded, respectively, at 2 × 105 and 7.5 × 104 cells/well of a 24-well plate 24 h prior to transfection. For immunofluorescence, AML12 and NIH3T3 cells were seeded, respectively, at 4 × 105 and 1.5 × 105 cells/chamber of a slide chamber 24 h prior to transfection. Transfection was carried out with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). For a 24-well plate, 0.6 μg of DNA, 3 μl of Plus reagent, and 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINE were used per well. For a chamber slide, 1.2 μg of DNA, 6 μl of Plus reagent, and 3 μl of LipofectAMINE were used per chamber. The functional expression of each cDNA was analyzed 48 h post-transfection by measuring radiolabeled amino acid uptake and by immunofluorescence in AML12 and NIH3T3 cells. Cotransfection with pEGFP-F was used for every experiment to monitor transfection efficiency by counting fluorescent cells expressing GFP. Transfection efficiency routinely approached 40 and 50% for NIH3T3 and AML12, respectively. Expression of exogenous LAT1 and 4F2 was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies directed to the epitope tag present on each protein. M2 antibody (Sigma) was used to detect FLAG-tagged LAT1, whereas HA.11 antibody (Babco) was used to detect hemagglutinin-tagged 4F2hc. Briefly, AML12 and NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pFLAG-LAT1 or pL(CD98-HA)IZ, and at 48 h after transfection, slides were fixed in cold acetone. Slides were blocked with 1% normal goat serum in PBS and then incubated with either M2 (mouse anti-FLAG) antibody at 10 μg/ml or HA.11 (mouse anti-hemagglutinin) antibody at 1:100 dilution in 1% normal goat serum in PBS. Slides were washed with PBS, blocked again, and incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma) at 1:100 dilution in 1% normal goat serum in PBS. After a subsequent wash and coverslipping, slides were examined on a Nikon Microphot-EPI-FL fluorescence microscope. Expression of endogenous LAT1 was detected using affinity-purified anti-peptide antibody to the NH2 terminus of LAT1 at 12 μg/ml. MacVector sequence analysis of the rat LAT1 coding region was used to select a region with little or no homology to other CD98 light chains and with high conservation to human LAT-1 and high hydrophilicity. Peptide 20–30, EERQAREKML, near the NH2terminus scored highest for these qualities and was synthesized commercially with an NH2-terminal cysteine for conjugation to keyhole lympet hemocyanin and used to immunize two rabbits following a conventional immunization schedule (Sigma-Genosys). The specificity of this antibody was demonstrated by absorption with the immunizing peptide (data not shown). Expression of endogenous 4F2hc was detected using an anti-4F2hc rabbit anti-peptide antibody (1:100) kindly provided by Dr. Suresh S. Tate (Cornell University Medical College, NY). This polyclonal antiserum was raised against a 92-amino acid peptide fragment (Lys-114–Tyr-205) of the rat glioma cell 4F2hc (29Broer S. Broer A. Hamprecht B. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Normal rabbit serum at the same concentration or dilution was used as a negative control (data not shown). Normal liver and GP7TB tumor cells were used as negative and positive controls, respectively, for LAT1 antibody reactivity (data not shown). Total RNA was isolated using the guanidinium isothiocyanate/cesium chloride method (30Chirgwin J.M. Przbyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar) for rat placenta and a modification of that method for cultured cell lines (Totally RNA Kit™, Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA was isolated from cultured cells after subculture in CEM for the relevant time points. Aliquots (12 μg) of total RNA were size-fractionated on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels as described previously (22Wolf D.A. Wang S. Panzica M.A. Bassily N.H. Thompson N.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5012-5022PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were equilibrated in 1 m ammonium acetate, and RNA was transferred to Nytran nylon membranes (Schleicher and Schüll). Blots were baked for 2 h at 80 °C and hybridized at 65 °C according to Church and Gilbert (31Church G. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). RatTA1 p900, a fragment corresponding to nucleotides 816–1536 of the full-length rat LAT-1 inserted into Bluescript SK vector, was labeled with [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by random primed labeling (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for use as a probe. Blots wrapped in plastic wrap were exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C in the presence of intensifying screens. Blots were stripped and rehybridized to an 1800-base pairEcoRI fragment of human 4F2hc (provided by Dr. Martin Hemler) (32Quackenbush E. Clabby M. Gottesdiener K.M. Barbosa J. Jones N.H. Strominger J.L. Speck S. Leiden J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6526-6530Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Densitometry using the Quantity One™ IBM software package was used to quantify differences in RNA levels with normalization to 18 S ribosomal RNA. The transport of radiolabeled amino acids by cell monolayers was performed using a modification of the cluster-tray method developed by Gazzola et al. (33Gazzola G.C. Dall'Asta V. Franchi-Gazzola R. White M.F. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 115: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and described by Kilberg (34Kilberg M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 564-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All 3H-labeled amino acids were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and unlabeled amino acids were purchased from Sigma. Cells were near confluent for the transport assay. Transport assays were performed as described previously (25Campbell W.A. Sah D.E. Medina M.M. Albina J.E. Coleman W.B. Thompson N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5347-5354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, before the transport assays, cells were rinsed with warm Na+-free KRP buffer, in which the sodium-containing salts were iso-osmotically replaced with choline, to remove extracellular Na+ and amino acids. Cells were incubated in warm Na+-free KRP buffer for 10 min to deplete intracellular amino acids. The uptake of radiolabeled amino acids (5 μCi of [3H]amino acid/ml) at 50 μmol/liter in either 200 μl of Na+-free KRP buffer or sodium KRP was measured for 30 s at 37 °C. Preliminary experiments indicated that uptake of each 3H-labeled amino acid was linearly dependent on incubation time up to at least 3 min; therefore, uptake was measured for 30 s (data not shown). In inhibition experiments, excess cold 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH) was added to the uptake buffer at 10 mm final concentration. Uptake was terminated by washing the cells rapidly four times with 1 ml/well of ice-cold Na+-free KRP buffer. After the trays were allowed to dry, the cells were incubated for 1 h with 0.2 ml/well of 0.2% (w/v) SDS plus 0.2 N NaOH to release intracellular radioactivity. A 0.1-ml aliquot from each well was neutralized with 0.1 ml of 0.2n HCl and quantified in a Beckman LS 6000SC liquid scintillation counter. The remaining 0.1 ml was analyzed for protein content using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Transport velocities were calculated from radioactive counts, specific activities of uptake mixes, and protein absorbance values and were expressed as picomoles amino acid transported per mg of protein per min (averages ± S.E. of ≥ 4 separate determinations). All data were normalized for transfection efficiency. Data comparing two experimental results were analyzed statistically by Student'st test using the InStat Macintosh statistics program. Two experimental results were considered to be statistically significantly different when p < 0.05. Each experiment was repeated with independent transfections at least twice to show qualitatively the same results. Averages of three independent experiments are shown for both AML12 and NIH3T3 cells. Cells were seeded into 6-well plates, transfected with plasmid DNA, and then cultured in CEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum without arginine. The medium was changed every day. Transfection efficiency was monitored by GFP expression and immunofluorescence. Cells were counted by the trypan dye exclusion test at the beginning of the experiment as well as 24 and 48 h after culture in CEM without arginine. Cell number was expressed as averages ± S.E. of three or more separate determinations. The experiment was repeated with independent transfections to show qualitatively the same results. An aliquot of cells from each condition was saved for cell cycle analysis. These cells were stained with 1× propidium iodide stain (50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% sodium citrate in H2O) for ∼10 min. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Becton Dickinson FACSORT flow cytometer, and data were analyzed with Cell Quest software. AML12 cells, an immortalized, nontransformed, nontumorigenic, well differentiated hepatocyte cell line, was established from the liver of transgenic mice overexpressing transforming growth factor-α (35Wu J.C. Merlino G. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This cell line was established because hepatocytes cannot be maintained for long periods of time as replicating, differentiated cells while remaining nontumorigenic. These cells have been used extensively as a model to study tissue-specific gene regulation and hepatocarcinogenesis because they are easily transfectable, do not display anchorage-independent growth or form tumors in nude mice, and maintain expression of differentiated hepatocyte markers after extensive passaging (35Wu J.C.

Masuko T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) to examine the functional significance of CD98 heavy chain overexpression. AML12 and NIH3T3 cells were cotransfected with pEGFP-F and pFLAG-5a, and transfection efficiency was monitored 48 h post-transfection by fluorescence of GFP (Fig. 1). Transfection efficiencies routinely approached 50 and 40% for AML12 and NIH3T3, respectively. Cotransfection with pEGFP-F was used to monitor transfection efficiency in all amino acid transport experiments. NIH3T3 and AML12 cells were transfected with either pFLAG-LAT1 or pL(CD98-HA)IZ to verify expression of exogenous protein by immunofluorescence in addition to transport activity (Fig. 2, Aand B). Both FLAG-tagged LAT1 and hemagglutinin-tagged 4F2hc were detected in transfected NIH3T3 and AML12 cells. The staining pattern indicated significant colocalization in both cell types. Staining was observed at the cell surface as well as within the cytoplasm. Anti-peptide antibodies were used to detect endogenous 4F2hc and LAT1 staining in both AML12 and NIH3T3 cells (Fig.2, C and D). The LAT1 epitope is on the NH2 terminus of the molecule, which is predicted to be cytoplasmic (38Verrey F. Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Pfeiffer R. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 172 (. H.): 181-192MCrossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The antibody to 4F2hc is directed to a predicted ectodomain (38Verrey F. Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Pfeiffer R. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 172 (. H.): 181-192MCrossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Intense staining was observed for 4F2hc in AML12 and NIH3T3 cells and for LAT1 in NIH3T3 cells. Staining for LAT1 was very weak in AML12 cells. The staining pattern for endogenous 4F2hc and LAT1 was very similar to staining for exogenous 4F2hc and LAT1 with both cytoplasmic and cell membrane staining. We observed similar immunofluorescent staining for all transfections. In previous studies using a panel of hepatic cell lines with specific differences in transformation and tumorigenicity, we found that LAT1 but not 4F2hc correlated with transformation, tumorigenicity, and increases in systeml transport activity (25Campbell W.A. Sah D.E. Medina M.M. Albina J.E. Coleman W.B. Thompson N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5347-5354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To determine the functional relevance of overexpression of LAT1 and requirement for 4F2hc in nontransformed hepatocytes, we overexpressed LAT1 and/or 4F2hc in AML12 cells and measured transport activity. Transport activity for systemsl and y+ were found to be sodium-independent (data not shown). As shown in Fig.3 a, overexpression of LAT1 increased system l-specific transport activity 2-fold (significant at p < 0.005) relative to 4F2hc or empty vector transfection. Overexpression of LAT1 and 4F2hc did not increase transport activity above that of LAT1 alone. As expected, addition of excess cold BCH inhibited leucine transport, consistent with systeml activity. Arginine transport (system y+) was not significantly different in any of the transfection conditions (Fig.3 b) and served as a control for any nonspecific influence of the transfection conditions. Other investigators have demonstrated that overexpression of CD98 heavy chain/4F2hc transforms NIH3T3 cells and that transformation depends on association with an unidentified light chain (26Hara K. Kudoh H. Enomoto T. Hashimoto Y. Masuko T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Shishido T. Uno S. Kamohara M. Tsuneoka-Suzuki T. Hashimoto Y. Enomoto T. Masuko T. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To determine whether LAT1 transfection can increase transport activity in NIH3T3 cells and to compare activity in hepatocytes versusfibroblasts, we overexpressed LAT1 alone or with 4F2hc in NIH3T3 cells. We found that overexpression of both LAT1 and 4F2hc increased systeml-specific transport activity approximately 2-fold (significant at p < 0.005) relative to LAT1, 4F2hc, or empty vector transfection (Fig.4 a). In contrast to the studies in hepatocytes, however, overexpression of LAT1 alone had no significant effect on transport activity.

Moreover, a novel form of intercellular communication has recently been identified where Ca2+ extruded from one cell, following agonist-driven Ca2+i mobilization, stimulates neighboring cells expressing calcium-sensing receptors (9Hofer A.M.

There is, however, indirect evidence against the Ca2+o sensing property of Group I mGlu receptors. Several studies have determined the origin of mGlu receptor-mediated Ca2+i responses; intracellular store release or extracellular Ca2+ entry, by removing Ca2+o.

Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were reported to be unaffected by removing Ca2+o. Moreover, the recently published x-ray crystallography structure of the NH2 terminus of the mGlu1α receptor identified a high affinity cation-binding site, which suggests that Ca2+ is more likely to be a “scaffold factor” rather than a physiological ligand (16Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Given the potential importance of Ca2+o sensing by these receptors such a fundamental question concerning their activation requires an unambiguous answer.To address this issue we have made real-time concurrent measurements of IP3 and Ca2+i in single cells expressing the mGlu1α receptor using a recently developed technique that utilizes an enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged pleckstrin homology domain of phospholipase Cδ1 (eGFP-PHPLCδ) to detect IP3 in Fura-2 loaded cells (17Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 18Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr.

PHPLCδ binds selectively to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) over all other inositol lipids (20Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and a fusion construct of this PH domain with eGFP associates with the plasma membrane (18Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Hirose et al. (17Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that PHPLCδ has higher affinity for the soluble head group of PIP2, IP3, and that PLC-induced elevations in IP3 cause translocation of the fusion protein to the cytosol. The extent of membrane association of eGFP-PHPLCδ can thus be used to evaluate cellular IP3 levels and, by preloading with Fura-2, simultaneous measurements of [Ca2+]i are possible in the same cell. This technique overcomes many of the inherent pitfalls in other assays by allowing simultaneous temporal analysis of two crucial indices of PLC signaling in single cells rather than in cell populations. Our data clearly indicate that the initial response to mGlu1α receptor activation is not sensitive to Ca2+o demonstrating that it is not a true Ca2+o-sensing receptor. However, for prolonged IP3 production Ca2+ entry is required. Moreover, Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores by IP3 is found to be essential for amplification of the initial response to agonist.DISCUSSIONIn the present work, the establishment of a real-time assay for the measurement of [IP3]i in single cells has revealed that the mGlu1α receptor does not show Ca2+o sensing properties. Although previous data from InsP accumulation experiments (Fig. 1; Ref. 4Saunders R. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) supported the view that Ca2+o modulates mGlu1α receptor activity, no differences in the early phases of IP3 production or Ca2+ mobilization in the presence or absence of Ca2+o were observed. Each of the following parameters appeared unchanged by removal of Ca2+o: the maximal response to quisqualate, the agonist potency, and the dynamics of the peak response for both IP3 production and Ca2+ mobilization. For the purposes of this study nominal [Ca2+]o was used because this maintains the integrity of the intracellular Ca2+ pool for longer compared with chelation of Ca2+ with EGTA, which can rapidly cause store depletion (25Maloney J.A. Tsygankova O.M. Yang L. Li Q. Szot A. Baysal K. Williamson J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C221-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The failure of Ca2+o to affect the initial events in mGlu1α receptor signaling suggests that the early processes involved in receptor activation, i.e. agonist binding, coupling to the G proteins, PLCβ activation and IP3 synthesis and release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, occur independently of Ca2+o. Clearly this differs from the activation of the calcium-sensing receptor where Ca2+ binding stimulates IP3 production, rapid Ca2+i transients, and coupling to Gαq/11 (26Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar, 27Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Brown E.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 209-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Arthur J.M. Collinsworth G.P. Gettys T.W. Quarles L.D. Raymond J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F129-135PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast, sustained increases in CHO-lac-mGlu1α for both [Ca2+]i and [IP3]i were highly dependent upon Ca2+o. This we believe offers the most probable explanation for the discrepancy between the InsP accumulation assays and the real-time analysis of IP3. Obviously, the contribution of the secondary phase of IP3production to accumulative measurements made over 15 min is very much greater than the initial transient peak IP3 synthesis, which is lost within 2–3 min. Sustained elevations in Ca2+i during prolonged agonist challenge commonly arise from opening of plasma membrane capacitative Ca2+channels, possibly synonymous with Trp channels (29Putney J.W. McKay R.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), as a result of store depletion. In contrast, activation of mGlu1α receptors has been reported to induce a rapid and complete uncoupling from PLC followed by opening of a receptor-operated Ca2+ channel (14Kawabata S. Kohara A. Tsutsumi R. Itahana H. Hayashibe S. Yamaguchi T. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17381-17385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The low level of sustained IP3 synthesis in the absence of Ca2+o observed using the confocal microscope is in disagreement with this suggestion. However, the predominant role of Ca2+-dependent PLCs (e.g. PLCδ; 30Allen V. Swigart P. Cheung R. Cockcroft S. Katan M. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 31Kim Y.H. Park T.J. Lee Y.H. Baek K.J. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Kim K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26127-26134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) during this secondary phase is indicated and is similar to M3 muscarinic receptors where IP3 production was also found to continue in the absence of Ca2+oat a decreased level (32Wojcikiewicz R.J. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 509-516PubMed Google Scholar). The data also indicate that the initial peak in [Ca2+]i predominantly represents Ca2+ release from intracellular stores with no involvement of Ca2+o entry. Two distinct phases are evidently involved in the response to activation of mGlu1α receptors.We have previously reported a sensitivity of M3 muscarinic and bradykinin receptor-induced IP3 responses in SH-SY5Y cells to store depletion using thapsigargin (32Wojcikiewicz R.J. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 509-516PubMed Google Scholar, 34Willars G.B. Challiss R.A. Stuart J.A. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and an important observation described here is the almost complete dependence of IP3 production by the mGlu1α receptor on Ca2+released from the intracellular stores. This sensitivity of mGlu1α receptors to intracellular store Ca2+ may reflect the selective recruitment of PLC isoenzymes responsive to variations in [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, the association of the mGlu1α receptor with Homer/Vesl proteins (35Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Nature. 1997; 386: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 36Kato A. Ozawa F. Saitoh Y. Fukazawa Y. Sugiyama H. Inokuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23969-23975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) allows for potential cross-linking with IP3 and/or ryanodine receptors (37Tu, J. C., Xiao, B., Yuan, J. P., Lanahan, A. A., Leoffert, K., Li, M., Linden, D. J., and Worley, P. F.Neuron 21, 717–726.Google Scholar). Theoretically this could hold mGlu1α receptors in close proximity to the site of Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum such that high local concentrations of Ca2+ may dramatically potentiate the activity of Ca2+-sensitive PLCs. Irrespective of the origins of this sensitivity it is important to note that any inadvertent depletion of Ca2+istores prior to assaying mGlu1α receptor activity will give results that could be erroneously interpreted as demonstrating Ca2+o sensitivity. Numerous authors have reported store depletion during prolonged incubation in Ca2+-free buffers (e.g. Ref. 25Maloney J.A. Tsygankova O.M. Yang L. Li Q. Szot A. Baysal K. Williamson J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C221-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Kubo et al. (5Kubo Y. Miyashita T. Murata Y. Science. 1998; 279: 1722-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) identified Ser166 as controlling the Ca2+o sensing properties of rat mGlu1α receptors. This apparent inconsistency in Ca2+osensing property of mGlu1α receptors does not reflect species differences, since the rat mGlu1α receptor expressed in BHK cells responded in a similar manner to the human receptor. The x-ray crystallography structure of the mGlu1α receptor revealed the presence of a high affinity cation-binding site that is likely to be important to the structural integrity of the extracellular domain (16Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). The high affinity of this site argues against a role in detecting physiological fluctuations in synaptic Ca2+obecause the site would always be occupied. A similar argument has been used to propose that GABAB receptors are not physiological Ca2+o sensors (7Galvez T. Urwyler S. Prezeau L. Mosbacher J. Joly C. Malitschek B. Heid J. Brabet I. Froestl W. Bettler B. Kaupmann K. Pin J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, mutations that interfere with Ca2+ binding might be anticipated to affect signaling through structural changes. This may explain the importance of Ser166, although this residue appears distant to the cation-binding site (16Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for the discrepancy could relate to the expression system used (Xenopusoocytes versus CHO cells) since activation of the Ca2+-activated Cl− current occurs downstream of the events determined in this study. It is likely that these measurements will be more sensitive to Ca2+o influx than the initial IP3 production. In fact we show here that raising Ca2+o increases [Ca2+]i without affecting [IP3] presumably as a consequence of enhanced store-operated Ca2+entry. Since mGlu1α receptors have also been argued to couple to a receptor-operated Ca2+ channel during prolonged agonist exposure (14Kawabata S. Kohara A. Tsutsumi R. Itahana H. Hayashibe S. Yamaguchi T. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17381-17385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it is also conceivable that mutation of Ser166 could influence this process without affecting coupling to PLC.In conclusion, the presented data are entirely consistent with the failure of Ca2+o to influence the initial activation of PLC by mGlu1α receptors. This study also demonstrates the usefulness of imaging of IP3 and [Ca2+]i in single cells by transfection with the eGFP-PHPLCδ fusion protein (17Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) and loading with Fura-2. The close similarity of the EC50 value for quisqualate-induced effects on IP3 measured by eGFP-PHPLCδ translocation with that of Hermans et al. (22Hermans E. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using a radioreceptor assay (22Hermans E. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) argues that this is an accurate measure of IP3 production. Moreover, a peak and plateau in IP3 levels is commonly reported (22Hermans E. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5037-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), while PIP2 levels tend to decrease monophasically to a new steady-state (38Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5037-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) suggesting that PIP2 depletion is not the major signal for translocation as was originally suggested (18Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Importantly, our data also confirm for the first time that IP3 follows such a pattern in a single cell since a peak and plateau in IP3 levels obtained for cell populations using radioreceptor assays (22Hermans E. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5037-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) could equally have arisen through differences in the timing of PLC activation within individual cells. Dual imaging of IP3 and Ca2+i in the same cell has thus allowed investigation of the Ca2+o sensing property of mGlu1α receptors without the problems of ambiguity present using more established experimental techniques. The Group I subfamily of metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGlu11 and mGlu5, couple to phospholipase C (PLC) via Gq/11 proteins to stimulate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) production and to mobilize intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) stores (1Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar,2Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar). Recently, the close structural similarity of the amino-terminal domain of mGlu receptors with that of the calcium-sensing receptor led to the suggestion that mGlu receptors may also respond to changes in extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]o) (3Kubokawa K.

Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were reported to be unaffected by removing Ca2+o. Moreover, the recently published x-ray crystallography structure of the NH2 terminus of the mGlu1α receptor identified a high affinity cation-binding site, which suggests that Ca2+ is more likely to be a “scaffold factor” rather than a physiological ligand (16Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Given the potential importance of Ca2+o sensing by these receptors such a fundamental question concerning their activation requires an unambiguous answer. To address this issue we have made real-time concurrent measurements of IP3 and Ca2+i in single cells expressing the mGlu1α receptor using a recently developed technique that utilizes an enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged pleckstrin homology domain of phospholipase Cδ1 (eGFP-PHPLCδ) to detect IP3 in Fura-2 loaded cells (17Hirose K.

PHPLCδ binds selectively to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) over all other inositol lipids (20Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol.

Hirose et al. (17Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that PHPLCδ has higher affinity for the soluble head group of PIP2, IP3, and that PLC-induced elevations in IP3 cause translocation of the fusion protein to the cytosol. The extent of membrane association of eGFP-PHPLCδ can thus be used to evaluate cellular IP3 levels and, by preloading with Fura-2, simultaneous measurements of [Ca2+]i are possible in the same cell. This technique overcomes many of the inherent pitfalls in other assays by allowing simultaneous temporal analysis of two crucial indices of PLC signaling in single cells rather than in cell populations. Our data clearly indicate that the initial response to mGlu1α receptor activation is not sensitive to Ca2+o demonstrating that it is not a true Ca2+o-sensing receptor. However, for prolonged IP3 production Ca2+ entry is required. Moreover, Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores by IP3 is found to be essential for amplification of the initial response to agonist.

This molecule is a mammalian homolog of DAF-16, which plays an important role in the longevity ofCaenorhabditis elegans. In this study we found that Akt and FKHRL1 proteins were detectable in highly purified normal human megakaryocytes and that these molecules were actually phosphorylated by thrombopoietin (TPO). To clarify the functional role of FKHRL1 in TPO signaling, we established a tetracycline-inducible system in the human TPO-dependent leukemia cell line UT-7/TPO. Induced expression of active FKHRL1 led to cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in this cell line. These results suggest that FKHRL1 plays an important role in the cell cycle of megakaryocytic cells as one of the downstream target molecules of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt, presumably mediated through the activation or inactivation of cell cycle-associated gene(s).

Viars C.S. Czekay S. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Genomics. 1998; 47: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This family, characterized by the presence of a highly conserved forkhead domain having a winged-helix motif and DNA binding activity, is involved in embryogenesis, differentiation, and tumorigenesis (2Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). DAF-16 plays an important role in the longevity of Caenorhabditis elegans (3Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1997; 389: 994-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, the dauer lava ensures its survival in adverse conditions by lowering its metabolism and changing its shape and can live up to ten times longer than a normal adult (4Kops G.J Burgering B.M.T. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). DAF-16 induces dauer formation and its activity is negatively regulated by DAF-2. Indeed, inC. elegans, a loss-of-function mutation in theDAF-2 gene causes developmental arrest at the dauer stage via the enhancement of DAF-16 transcription activity, resulting in an extension of the life span (5Kenyon C. Chang J. Gensch E. Ruder A. Tabtiang R.A.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (2523) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggested that FKHRL1 plays an important role in mammalian biology. This notion is supported by the evidence that there is a highly conserved signaling pathway between C. elegans and human. DAF-2 is an insulin receptor-like protein, AGE-1 is a catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)1-like protein, DAF-23 is a PI3K-like protein, AKT1/AKT2 is a serine/threonine kinase protein kinase B (PKB) (also known as Akt)-like protein, and DAF-16 has high homology to the mammalian Forkhead subfamily FKHRL1, AFX, and FKHR (4Kops G.J Burgering B.M.T. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Akt has been identified as a downstream target of PI3K necessary for survival (6Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). Akt activated by growth factors phosphorylates apoptosis-associated molecules including Bad, caspase-9, IKKα, and GSK-3 ensuring cell survival (7Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y.

Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). In addition, the constitutively active form of Akt blocks apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation (11Bao H. Jacobs-Helber S.M. Lawson A.E. Penta K. Wickrema A. Sawyer S.T.

Recently, FKHRL1, AFX, and FKHR have been identified as substrates of Akt (13Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E.

Phosphorylation of these proteins by Akt regulates their nuclear translocation and targets gene transcription. There are two or three potential Akt phosphorylation sites (RXRXX(S/T)) on these three members. For example, FKHRL1 has three putative phosphorylation sites; Thr32 (RPRSCT32), Ser253 (RRRAVS253), and Ser315 (RSRTNS315). When cells are stimulated with serum or growth factors, a phosphorylated form of FKHRL1 is retained in the cytoplasm and interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, resulting in inhibition of target gene transcription. By contrast, when cells are deprived of serum or growth factors, a nonphosphorylated form of FKHRL1 translocates into nucleus and activates the transcription of target genes. These findings indicate that FKHRL1, when not phosphorylated by Akt, is an activator of transcription. Thus, phosphorylation by Akt is essential for suppressing the transcription activity of FKHRL1. In other words, Akt negatively regulates the transcription activity of FKHRL1 by phosphorylation (13Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). This is also true for both AFX and FKHR (14Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol.

Burgering B.M.T. Nature. 1999; 398: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Very recently we identified FKHRL1 as one of the downstream molecules of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt activation pathway in erythropoietin (EPO) signal transduction (12Kashii Y. Uchida M. Kirito K. Tanaka M. Nishijima K. Toshima M. Ando T. Koizumi K. Endoh T. Sawada Ki. Momoi M. Miura Y. Ozawa K. Komatsu N. Blood. 2000; 96: 941-949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the functional role of this molecule in erythropoiesis is still open to question. Based on several lines of evidence that there is a close relationship between erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis (20Longmore G.D. Pharr P. Neumann D. Lodish H.F. Blood. 1999; 82: 2386-2395Crossref Google Scholar, 21Komatsu N. Kirito K. Shimizu R. Kunitama M. Yamada M. Uchida M. Takatoku M. Eguchi M. Miura Y.

Nature. 1990; 344: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), we examined whether or not TPO, a major regulator of megakaryopoiesis, induces phosphorylation of Akt and FKHRL1 in a human TPO-dependent leukemia cell line UT-7/TPO (23Komatsu N. Kunitama M. Yamada M. Hagiwara T. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Eguchi M. Yamamoto M. Miura Y. Blood. 1996; 87: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and highly purified normal human megakaryocytes. Moreover, to elucidate the function of FKHRL1 in TPO signaling, we established a tetracycline (Tet)-inducible expression system in UT-7/TPO cells. Our results suggest that FKHRL1 is phosphorylated by TPO stimulation via Akt activation and that unphosphorylated FKHRL1 negatively regulates the cell cycle, presumably via the activation or inactivation of cell cycle-associated gene(s). Recombinant TPO was kindly donated by Kirin Brewery Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). 2-mercaptoethanol, sodium orthovanadate, bovine serum albumin (BSA), DNase, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM), saturated transferrin, oleic acid, l-α-phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and propidium iodide were purchased from Sigma. Vitamin B12 and folic acid were purchased from Sankyo Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. (Osaka, Japan), respectively. Dynabeads M (tm) 450 coated with goat anti-mouse IgG was from Dynal Inc. (Great Neck, NY). Fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin, and streptomycin were from Flow Laboratories, Inc. (McLean, VA). Insulin (porcine sodium, activity 26.3 United States Pharmacopoeia units/mg) was purchased from CalBiochem and Behring Diagnostics (La Jolla, CA). Polyclonal antibodies against AKT (C-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against phosphothreonine 32 [phospho-Thr32]FKHRL1, phosphoserine 253 [phospho-Ser253]FKHRL1, native FKHRL1, GST·FKHRL1 fusion protein, and cDNAs for wild-type and triple mutant FKHRL1 were kindly provided by Dr. Anne Brunet (Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston) (13Brunet A.

Phosphoplus AKT (Ser473) Antibody Kit and AKT Kinase Assay Kit were purchased from New England BioLabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). MEBCYTO-Apoptosis Kit was purchased from MBL (Nagoya, Japan). UT-7/TPO was maintained in liquid culture with IMDM containing 10% FCS and 10 ng/ml TPO (23Komatsu N. Kunitama M. Yamada M. Hagiwara T. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Eguchi M. Yamamoto M. Miura Y. Blood. 1996; 87: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell growth was examined by a colorimetric assay according to Mosmann with some modifications (24Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46884) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated at a density of 1 × 104/100 μl2 in 96-well plates in IMDM containing 10% FCS in the presence of TPO (10 ng/ml). After 72 h of culture at 37 °C, 20 μl of sterilized 5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) was added to each well. Following a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, 100 ml of 10% SDS was added to each well to dissolve the dark-blue crystal product. The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 595 nm using a microplate reader (model 3550; Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). UT-7/TPO cells were deprived of growth factor for 24 h. After stimulation with TPO at 37 °C for a given period, cells were washed and suspended in lysis buffer composed of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate. After 20 min of incubation on ice, insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-Akt antibody (C-20) attached to protein G-Sepharose for 4 h at 4 °C in an Eppendorf shaker. Immunoprecipitates were collected by a brief centrifugation and washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE and were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The blots were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h and then incubated with the appropriate concentration of primary antibodies including anti-phosphoAkt(Ser473) polyclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C. After a wash with TBS containing Tween 20 (1:1,000), the blots were probed with a 1:2,000 dilution of anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 20 min at room temperature. After a second wash, the blots were incubated with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate according to the instruction manual (New England BioLabs Inc.). In some experiments, the supernatants were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mmsodium fluoride. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane. The blots were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with the appropriate concentration of primary antibody against [phospho-Thr32]FKHRL1, [phospho-Ser253]FKHRL1, or native FKHRL1 overnight at 4 °C. After a wash with TBS containing Tween 20 (1:2,000), the blots were probed with a 1:5,000 dilution of anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies for 90 min at room temperature. After a second wash, the blots were incubated with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (ECL Western blot detection system; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, England) and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to visualize immunoreactive bands. The blots were stripped with 62.5 mmTris-HCI, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min and were washed, blocked, and reprobed. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with the Akt kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2). In vitro kinase experiments were performed with a commercial kit (AKT Kinase Assay Kit) using GSK-3 or GST·FKHRL1 fusion protein (13Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S.

Reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by ECL. To express FKHRL1-TM cDNA, we used a T-RExTM system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), in which transcription of a target cDNA is initiated by Tet treatment. In brief, UT-7/TPO cells initially were transfected with expression vectors for the Tet repressor, pcDNA6/TR, by lipofection. After culture with 0.5 μg/ml of blasticidin (Invitrogen), one clone (designated UT-7/TPO/pcDNA6/TR-2) was transfected further with a Tet-inducible expression vector, pcDNA4/TO, for FKHRL1-TM. After selection with Zeocin (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 200 μg/ml, the induction levels of the FKHRL1-TM protein were examined before and after 1 μg/ml Tet treatment by Western blotting analyses. The transfectants designated UT-7/TPO/FKHRL1-TM clone 1 and clone 2 were subjected to further analyses because the target proteins were induced most efficiently by Tet treatment in these clones. Cytospin preparations were fixed and permeabilized in PBS containing 4.0% paraformaldehyde and 0.4% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. After a wash with PBS, the cells were incubated with anti-FKHRL1 antibody diluted 1:20 in PBS containing 2% FCS and 0.05% Tween 20 at 4 °C at overnight. After a second wash with PBS, the cells were incubated for 60 min with Alexa Fluor TM 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugate (Molecular Probes, Eugenes, OR) diluted 1:1000. Then, the cells were washed with PBS and mounted in Perma Fluor Aqueous Mountant (Shandon/Lipshaw/Immunon, Pittusburgh, PA). Laser confocal scanning images were obtained using a TCS 4D confocal system (Leica Instruments, Wetzlar, Germany). Human megakaryocytic cells were generated ex vivo, as described, with minor modifications (25Koizumi K. Sawada K. Yamaguchi M. Notoya A. Tarumi T. Takano H. Fukada Y. Nishio M. Katagiri E.

In brief, recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., and Kyowa Hakko Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) was administered to healthy volunteers (who had previously signed consent forms approved by the Hokkaido University School of Medicine and the Hokkaido Red Cross Blood Center committee for the Protection of Human Subjects), as described (26Sato N. Sawada K. Takahashi T.A. Mogi Y. Asano S. Koike T. Sekiguchi S. Exp. Hematol. 1994; 22: 973-978PubMed Google Scholar). The mobilized peripheral blood CD34+ cells were isolated using immunomagnetic beads (27Sawada K. Krantz S.B. Dai C.H. Koury S.T. Horn S.T. Glick A.D. Civin C.I. J. Cell.

The frozen peripheral blood CD34+ cells were thawed and suspended in IMDM containing 30% FCS and 100 units/ml DNase and then were centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with IMDM containing 0.3% deionized BSA and then resuspended in IMDM containing 0.3% deionized BSA. The cells were next cultured in liquid phase, as described elsewhere, with minor modifications (25Koizumi K. Sawada K. Yamaguchi M. Notoya A. Tarumi T. Takano H. Fukada Y. Nishio M. Katagiri E.

In brief, cells ranging from 2.0 × 104 to 4.0 × 104 cells/ml were suspended in a mixture containing 5% pooled human AB plasma, 1% BSA, 30 mg/ml of iron-saturated transferrin, 10 μg/ml of insulin, lipid suspension (2.8 μg/ml oleic acid, 4.0 μg/ml l-α-phosphatidylcholine, and 3.9 μg/ml cholesterol; Sigma) (29Sawada K.

Invest. 1989; 83: 1701-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), vitamin B12 at 10 μg/ml, and folic acid at 15 μg/ml, with TPO at 100 ng/ml, in the presence of 5 × 10−5 mole/ml 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin at 50 units/ml, streptomycin at 50 units/ml, and IMDM in a 50 ml polystyrene flask (Corning Coster Corp., Cambridge, MA). After incubation for 10 days at 37 °C in a 95% N2, 5% O2 incubator, the cells were collected, and washed twice with IMDM containing 0.3% BSA (Day 10 cells). Phenotyping of Day 10 cells was done by flow cytometry using FACS (Vantage Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), as described (25Koizumi K. Sawada K. Yamaguchi M. Notoya A. Tarumi T. Takano H. Fukada Y. Nishio M. Katagiri E. Yasukouchi T. Sato N. Sekiguchi S. Koike T. Exp. Hematol. 1998; 26: 1140-1147PubMed Google Scholar). The following reagents were used: CD41 (TP80, fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (FITC), Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan), CD42b (phycoerythrin conjugate (PE), PharMingen, San Diego, CA), CD61 (FITC, PharMingen), and glycophorin A (FITC, DAKO Japan Co., Kyoto, Japan). Cell cycle analysis was performed by staining DNA with propidium iodide in preparation for flow cytometry with the FACScan/CellFIT system (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). In the following experiments we mainly used the UT-7/TPO cell line (23Komatsu N. Kunitama M. Yamada M. Hagiwara T. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Eguchi M. Yamamoto M. Miura Y. Blood. 1996; 87: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line absolutely depends on TPO for growth and survival, and it has mature megakaryocytic properties such as a developed demarcation membrane in the cytoplasm, high expression of the megakaryocyte-specific markers, platelet factor-4 and glycoprotein IIb mRNAs, and high DNA content (23Komatsu N. Kunitama M. Yamada M. Hagiwara T. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Eguchi M. Yamamoto M. Miura Y. Blood. 1996; 87: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, UT-7/TPO is a good model of megakaryocytic cells for elucidating the biological role of the PI3K-Akt-FKHRL1 activation pathway in TPO singaling. Based on the recent reports that Akt is activated by several cytokines including interleukin-3, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and EPO (12Kashii Y. Uchida M. Kirito K. Tanaka M. Nishijima K. Toshima M. Ando T. Koizumi K. Endoh T. Sawada Ki. Momoi M. Miura Y. Ozawa K. Komatsu N. Blood. 2000; 96: 941-949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Songyang Z. Baltimore D. Cantley L.C. Kaplan D.R.

Blood. 2000; 95: 1656-1662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we initially examined whether or not TPO activates Akt in UT-7/TPO cells. Growth factor-deprived UT-7/TPO cells were exposed to TPO (100 ng/ml) for given periods of up to 60 min and then harvested for immunoprecipitation with anti-Akt antibody. Western blotting analysis was performed using anti-[phospho-Ser473]Akt antibody, which recognizes a phosphorylated serine473, one of two sites on Akt phosphorylated in its active form. As shown in Fig.1 A, phosphorylated Akt appeared within 1 min, and its level reached a maximum at 5 to 10 min, and had diminished by 60 min. Moreover, growth factor-deprived UT-7/TPO cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of TPO (0.1–100 ng/ml). As shown in Fig. 1 B, phosphorylated Akt was detected at 10 ng/ml of TPO, and the level reached a plateau at 100 ng/ml of TPO. These findings indicate that TPO induced phosphorylation of Akt in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The growth factor-deprived UT-7/TPO cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of the PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 (1 μm-100 μm) for 45 min and then stimulated with TPO (100 ng/ml). Ten min later, the cells were harvested for cell extraction. Western blotting analysis was performed using anti-[phospho-Ser473]Akt antibody. As shown in Fig.2 A, the phosphorylation density of Akt was markedly diminished at 10 μm LY294002 and equal to the basal level at 50 μm LY294002. This result suggested that TPO-induced phosphorylation of Akt is mediated via PI3K activity. To confirm the activation of Akt by TPO, we performed in vitro kinase assay using GSK-3 as substrate (Fig.3 A). After exposure to TPO (100 ng/ml) for given periods of up to 60 min, the cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Akt antibody and in vitrokinase assay was performed according to the instructions of the AKT Kinase Assay Kit. The density of phosphorylated GSK-3 was enhanced after a 5-min exposure to TPO, and its enhancement continued until 60 min. This observation indicates that TPO indeed induced Akt kinase activation in UT-7/TPO cells. Recently it was reported that FKHRL1 is a substrate of Akt kinase in vitro (13Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). We also found that Akt kinase activated by EPO directly phosphorylated the FKHRL1 protein (12Kashii Y. Uchida M. Kirito K. Tanaka M. Nishijima K. Toshima M. Ando T. Koizumi K. Endoh T. Sawada Ki. Momoi M. Miura Y. Ozawa K. Komatsu N. Blood. 2000; 96: 941-949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that FKHRL1 lies downstream of Akt kinase in the TPO signaling pathway, we examined whether or not FKHRL1 is phosphorylated by TPO treatment. Growth factor-deprived UT-7/TPO cells were exposed to TPO (100 ng/ml) for given periods of up to 60 min or exposed to increasing concentrations of TPO (0.1–100 ng/ml) for 10 min, and then the cells were harvested for preparation of total cell lysates. Western blotting analysis was performed using anti-phospho-Thr32 antibody and anti-phospho-Ser253 that recognize a phosphorylated threonine 32 and a phosphorylated serine 253, respectively. FKHRL1 was phosphorylated at Thr32 and Ser253 at 1 min, the level reaching a plateau at 5–20 min and declining thereafter (Fig. 1 C). Phosphorylated FKHRL1 was detectable at 0.1 ng/ml of TPO, and the level reached a plateau at 1 ng/ml of TPO (Fig.1 D). These findings indicate that TPO induced phosphorylation of FKHRL1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The growth factor-deprived UT-7/TPO cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of the PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 (1–100 μm) for 45 min and then were stimulated with TPO (100 ng/ml). Ten min later, the cells were harvested for cell extraction. Western blotting analysis with anti-phospho-Thr32 antibody and anti-phospho-Ser253 revealed that the phosphorylation density of FKHRL1 at Thr32 and Ser253 was markedly diminished at 10 μm LY294002 and completely disappeared at 50 μm of LY294002 (Fig. 2 B). This result suggested that TPO-induced phosphorylation of FKHRL1 is mediated via PI3K activity. To demonstrate that FKHRL1 is directly targeted by AKT kinase activated by TPO in vivo, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using GST·FKHRL1 fusion protein as a substrate. TPO-deprived UT-7/TPO cells were exposed to TPO for 10 or 20 min and then harvested for immunoprecipitation with anti-Akt antibody. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with GST·FKHRL1 fusion protein according to the instructions of the AKT Kinase Assay Kit with some modifications. As shown in Fig. 3 B, a phosphorylated FKHRL1 band was obtained with antibody, which recognizes phosphorylated Thr32 and phosphorylated Ser253, respectively, indicating that Akt activated by TPO directly phosphorylated FKHRL1 at Thr32 and Ser253. We examined whether or not FKHRL1 is expressed in normal megakaryocytes. To obtain a large amount of megakaryocytes for Western blotting analysis, human CD34-positive cells were cultured in the presence of Interleukin-3, SCF, and TPO for 10 days. Isolated human megakaryocytic cells expressed the specific megakaryocytic markers CD41 at 93.7%, CD61 at 75.5%, and CD42b at 42.8%, but did not express the erythroid-specific marker GPA (Fig. 4,A–D). Virtually all CD42b-positive cells expressed CD41 antigens (Fig. 4 C). Using these highly purified megakaryocytes, we examined whether or not Akt and its downstream molecule FKHRL1 are indeed phosphorylated in primary megakaryocytic cells. After a 2-h deprivation of growth factors, the cells were stimulated with TPO (100 ng/ml) for 20 min and then harvested for Western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, E andF, Akt and FKHRL1 proteins were indeed expressed in megakaryocytes. As expected, Akt at Ser473 and FKHRL1 at Thr32 and Ser253 were clearly phosphorylated by TPO treatment. Considering that FKHRL1 lies downstream of the PI3K-Akt activation pathway, these results raised the possibility that FKHRL1 is involved in the TPO-induced cell survival as a target molecule of the PI3K-Akt pathway. To test this possibility, we expressed the triple mutant of FKHRL1 (FKHRL1-TM) in UT-7/TPO by using a Tet-inducible system, in which expression of the target protein is induced by Tet treatment. FKHRL1-TM in which Thr32, Ser253, and Ser315 are all converted to alanines is localized to the nucleus and activates the Fas ligand (FasL) gene promoter in vitro, indicating that FKHRL1-TM is an “active” form for activation of target gene(s).

Although initially identified in T-cells, recent data have unveiled unanticipated roles for NFATs in the development, proliferation, and differentiation of other tissues. Here we report the identification, cDNA cloning, and functional characterization of a new isoform of NFAT1 highly expressed in mouse brain. This isoform, which we named NFAT1-D, is identical to NFAT1 throughout the N-terminal regulatory domain and the portion of the Rel domain which includes the minimal region required for specific binding to DNA and interaction with AP-1. The homology stops sharply upstream of the 3′-boundary of the Rel homology domain and is followed by a short unique C-terminal region. NFAT1-D was expressed at high levels in all brain districts and was found as a constitutively active transcription complex. Transfection of a NFAT/luciferase reporter in the neuronal cell line PC12, which also expresses NFAT1-D, showed that these cells expressed a constitutive NFAT activity that was enhanced after nerve growth factor-induced differentiation but was resistant to the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A. NFAT1-D was, however, inducibly activated in a cyclosporin A-sensitive manner when expressed in T-cells, suggesting that the activity of NFAT proteins might be controlled by their specific cellular context.

Initially described as a transcriptional complex that bound a T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)1 response element on the interleukin (IL)-2 gene enhancer, nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) is a family of transcription factors crucially involved in the regulation of cytokine gene expression in T-cells (1Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). NFAT activity is strongly unregulated after TCR triggering; however, receptor engagement can be bypassed by a combination of phorbol esters and calcium ionophores, which activate protein kinase C and induce a rise in intracellular calcium ions, respectively. This dual requirement reflects the subunit composition of NFAT factors, which includes a cytoplasmic and a nuclear component. In resting cells, NFAT is found as a cytosolic protein phosphorylated on serine residues. After an elevation in intracellular calcium ions, the calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin is activated and dephosphorylates NFAT, exposing a nuclear localization sequence near the N terminus of NFAT and resulting in its translocation to the nucleus (2Beals C.R.

In the nucleus NFAT assembles in cooperative DNA-binding complexes with dimers of the AP-1 family of transcription factors (4Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L.

Complementation studies using constitutively active mutants of signaling proteins have shown that the calcium/calcineurin and the Ras/protein kinase C/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways are integrated at the level of NFAT proteins (10Baldari C.T.

All NFAT proteins share a conserved DNA binding domain, which shows a weak similarity with the DNA binding domain of Rel family proteins (RHD) and permits interaction with Fos/Jun heterodimers at composite DNA binding sites on a number of cytokine gene enhancers (1Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region shows significant homology among NFAT1–4 and is characterized by a number of features important for regulation, including a nuclear localization sequence, the sites of interaction with calcineurin, and a highly conserved SP repeat region (SPXXSPXXSPXXXXX(D/E)(D/E), which is likely to be the target of kinase/phosphatase activity (1Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the N-terminus of NFAT1 has been functionally characterized as a transactivation domain and, like the corresponding regions of NFAT2–4, contains at least one acidic/hydrophobic patch that resembles those implicated in transactivation by acidic activation domains (1Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). In agreement with a regulatory role for the N-terminal NFAT homology region, NFAT5, which lacks this region, has a calcineurin-independent constitutive nuclear localization in a number of cell types, including T-cells (14Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). NFAT family members differ widely at their C termini, as they are expressed mostly as multiple isoforms generated by either alternative splicing or, as recently shown for NFAT2, by alternative polyadenylation (19Chuvpilo S. Zimmer M. Kerstan A. Glockner J. Avots A. Escher C. Fischer C. Inashkina I. Jankevics E. Berberich-Siebelt F. Schmitt E. Serfling E. Immunity. 1999; 10: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The difference in transactivation activity among NFAT isoforms appears related to the presence, in specific isoforms, of an additional transactivation domain in the C-terminal region (20Luo C. Burgeon E. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Although initially characterized in T-cells, NFAT family members are in some instances broadly expressed not only in other cells of the immune system, but also in ontogenically distinct tissues. While NFAT2 expression is mostly restricted to T and B-cells and NFAT4 to thymocytes (12Ho S.N. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Li X. Francke U. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol.

For example, NFAT1 has been shown to be a repressor of chondrogenesis (23Ranger A.M. Gerstenfeld L.C. Wang J. Kon T. Bae H. Gravallese E.M. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. J. Exp.

Furthermore, a number of data suggest a potential role for NFAT factors in myogenesis and adipogenesis (26Abbott K.L. Friday B.B. Thaloor D. Murphy T.J. Pavlath G.K. Mol. Biol.

NFAT1 has been detected in the mouse olfactory bulb and in a neuronal cell line (22Ho A.M. Jain J. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28181-28186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and NFAT3- and NFAT5-specific mRNA has also been detected at high levels in the brain (13Hoey T. Sun Y.L. Williamson K. Xu X. Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 14Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Recently NFAT3 has been shown to translocate to the nucleus and activate NFAT-dependent transcription in response to electrical activity or potassium depolarization in pyramidal neurons, suggesting a role for NFAT3 in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory (28Graef I.A.

Hence, NFAT factors might be implicated in brain development and function. Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a new NFAT1 isoform highly expressed and constitutively active in mouse brain, initially suggested by the presence of high levels of constitutive luciferase activity in the brain of a NFAT/luciferase (NFAT/luc) reporter transgenic mouse.

All NFAT proteins share a conserved DNA binding domain, which shows a weak similarity with the DNA binding domain of Rel family proteins (RHD) and permits interaction with Fos/Jun heterodimers at composite DNA binding sites on a number of cytokine gene enhancers (1Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region shows significant homology among NFAT1–4 and is characterized by a number of features important for regulation, including a nuclear localization sequence, the sites of interaction with calcineurin, and a highly conserved SP repeat region (SPXXSPXXSPXXXXX(D/E)(D/E), which is likely to be the target of kinase/phosphatase activity (1Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the N-terminus of NFAT1 has been functionally characterized as a transactivation domain and, like the corresponding regions of NFAT2–4, contains at least one acidic/hydrophobic patch that resembles those implicated in transactivation by acidic activation domains (1Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). In agreement with a regulatory role for the N-terminal NFAT homology region, NFAT5, which lacks this region, has a calcineurin-independent constitutive nuclear localization in a number of cell types, including T-cells (14Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). NFAT family members differ widely at their C termini, as they are expressed mostly as multiple isoforms generated by either alternative splicing or, as recently shown for NFAT2, by alternative polyadenylation (19Chuvpilo S. Zimmer M. Kerstan A. Glockner J. Avots A. Escher C. Fischer C. Inashkina I. Jankevics E. Berberich-Siebelt F. Schmitt E. Serfling E. Immunity. 1999; 10: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The difference in transactivation activity among NFAT isoforms appears related to the presence, in specific isoforms, of an additional transactivation domain in the C-terminal region (20Luo C. Burgeon E. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although initially characterized in T-cells, NFAT family members are in some instances broadly expressed not only in other cells of the immune system, but also in ontogenically distinct tissues. While NFAT2 expression is mostly restricted to T and B-cells and NFAT4 to thymocytes (12Ho S.N. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Li X. Francke U. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol.

For example, NFAT1 has been shown to be a repressor of chondrogenesis (23Ranger A.M. Gerstenfeld L.C. Wang J. Kon T. Bae H. Gravallese E.M. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), whereas NFAT2 was found to be essential for heart development (24de la Pompa J.L. Timmerman L.A. Takimoto H. Yoshida H. Elia A.J.

Furthermore, a number of data suggest a potential role for NFAT factors in myogenesis and adipogenesis (26Abbott K.L. Friday B.B. Thaloor D. Murphy T.J. Pavlath G.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2905-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 27Ho I.-C. Kim H.H.-J. Spiegelman B.M. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15537-15541Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Specific NFAT family members are also expressed in the brain. NFAT1 has been detected in the mouse olfactory bulb and in a neuronal cell line (22Ho A.M. Jain J. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28181-28186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and NFAT3- and NFAT5-specific mRNA has also been detected at high levels in the brain (13Hoey T. Sun Y.L. Williamson K. Xu X. Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 14Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Recently NFAT3 has been shown to translocate to the nucleus and activate NFAT-dependent transcription in response to electrical activity or potassium depolarization in pyramidal neurons, suggesting a role for NFAT3 in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory (28Graef I.A. Mermelstein P.G. Stankunas K. Neilson J.R. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Hence, NFAT factors might be implicated in brain development and function. Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a new NFAT1 isoform highly expressed and constitutively active in mouse brain, initially suggested by the presence of high levels of constitutive luciferase activity in the brain of a NFAT/luciferase (NFAT/luc) reporter transgenic mouse.

https://openalex.org/W1569927707,"Type I interferon (IFN)-dependent inhibition of cell growth can occur either in the absence or presence of apoptosis. The mechanisms that determine whether or not cells undergo apoptosis after exposure to IFN-α are not clear. This study shows that a variety of cell lines that display growth inhibition but not apoptosis in response to IFN-α will undergo programmed cell death when low concentrations of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate are added with IFN-α. In contrast, the combination of tumor necrosis factor-α with vanadate did not trigger apoptosis in these cells. Caspase-3 activity was detected only in cells exposed to IFN-α and vanadate but not to IFN-α or vanadate alone. The ability of IFN-α and vanadate to induce apoptosis did not require expression of p53 and was blocked by N-acetyl-l-cysteine. Activation of the Jak/Stat pathway and expression of IFN-inducible genes was not altered by incubation of cells with IFN-α and vanadate compared with IFN-α alone. However, mutant cells lacking Stat1, Stat2, Jak1, or Tyk2, or cells expressing kinase inactive Jak1 or Tyk2 did not undergo apoptosis in the presence of IFN-α and vanadate. These results suggest that IFN-α stimulation of Stat-dependent genes is necessary, but not sufficient, for this cytokine to induce apoptosis. Another signaling cascade that involves the activity of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase and/or the generation of reactive oxygen species may play an important role in promoting IFN-α-induced apoptosis.

Another signaling cascade that involves the activity of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase and/or the generation of reactive oxygen species may play an important role in promoting IFN-α-induced apoptosis. Type I interferons (IFNs)1 are a family of secreted polypeptides composed of three major subtypes (IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-ω) that exert many biological functions including antiviral and antigrowth activities, and modulation of immune responses (1Pestka S. Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). Because of its antiproliferative and antiviral properties, type I IFNs are currently used for the treatment of several forms of cancer and viral diseases. The biological effects of type I IFNs are mediated at least in part by the expression of a set of cellular genes induced upon IFNs binding to their specific receptor, which is composed of at least two subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 (3Mogensen K.E. Lewerenz M. Reboul J. Lutfalla G. Uze G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1069-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Each receptor subunit interacts with a distinct member of the Jak family of tyrosine kinases. IFNAR1 associates with Tyk2 whereas IFNR2 binds Jak1 (3Mogensen K.E. Lewerenz M. Reboul J. Lutfalla G. Uze G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1069-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The binding of IFNs to their receptors causes receptor dimerization and activation of Jak kinases by transphosphorylation, which in turn tyrosine phosphorylate the receptor chains. Latent transcription factors termed Stats bind to the phosphorylated receptor chains, become tyrosine-phosphorylated, and dimerize via their Src homology 2 domains. Phosphorylated Stat dimers translocate to the nucleus and bind specific sequences found in the promoters of IFN-inducible genes (4Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). Stat1 and Stat2 together with the DNA binding subunit p48 form the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) binding transcription factor complex ISGF3 (5Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar,6Fu X.-Y. Schindler C. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7840-7843Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Type I IFNs can also activate Stat1 and Stat3 homo- and heterodimers and Stat2 and Stat4 heterodimers, which bind to γ interferon activation sequences (GAS) like palindromic sequences (5Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar,7Farrar J.D. Smith J.D. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2693-2697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which type I IFNs exert their antigrowth effects are diverse and not clearly understood, but do require signaling mediated by IFN activation of the Jak/Stat pathway. However, transmission of IFN-α signals in various cell lines can lead to decreased rates of proliferation in the presence or absence of apoptosis, suggesting that other signaling pathways may play a role in the final response (8Roos G. Leanderson T. Lundgren E. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 2358-2362PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sangfelt O. Erickson S. Castro J. Heiden T. Einhorn S. Grander D. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar). For example, IFN-α-mediated apoptosis in H9 and U266 cells (a T-cell lymphoma and a myeloma cell line, respectively) occurs in the absence of cell cycle arrest. In contrast, the B-cell lymphoma, Daudi, only exhibits cell growth arrest at the G0/G1 transition after IFN-α treatment (8Roos G. Leanderson T. Lundgren E. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 2358-2362PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sangfelt O. Erickson S. Castro J. Heiden T. Einhorn S. Grander D.

Cancer. 1995; 61: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), while, in the leukemic T cell line Jurkat, IFN-α slows the rate of growth without causing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (11Petricoin III, E.F. Ito S. Williams B.L. Audet S. Stancato L.F. Gamero A. Clouse K. Grimley P. Weiss A. Beeler J. Finbloom D.S. Shores E.W. Abraham R. Larner A.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Effector molecules of the cell cycle have been reported to be regulated by type I IFNs. IFN-α induces the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21Cip1 and Ink4, resulting in decreased cyclin-dependent kinase activity and inhibition of cell cycle progression (12Matsuoka M. Tani K. Asano S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2075-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Sangfelt O. Erickson S. Einhorn S. Grander D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Other reports indicate that IFN-α decreases DNA binding activity of the E2F transcription factor and causes hypophosphorylation of the tumor suppressor protein, Rb (14Zhang K. Kumar R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, IFN-α can inhibit or induce the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the proto-oncogene/transcription factor c-myc (15Jewell A.P. Worman C.P. Lydyard P.M. Yong K.L. Giles F.J. Goldstone A.H. Br. J. Haematol. 1994; 88: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Einat M. Resnitzky D. Kimchi A. Nature. 1985; 313: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, Bcl-2 and c-Myc proteins and the tumor suppressor p53 might not be key determinants for the apoptotic process induced by IFN-α in certain cell lines (9Sangfelt O. Erickson S. Castro J. Heiden T. Einhorn S. Grander D. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar, 17Milner A.E. Grand R.J.A. Gregory C.D. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The role of the Jak/Stat signaling pathway or a second parallel signaling cascade in type I IFN-mediated apoptosis remains to be elucidated. We report here that vanadate in combination with IFN-α can promote apoptosis in transformed cell lines that only exhibit antigrowth activity in the presence of only type I IFNs. IFN-α- and vanadate-stimulated programmed cell death does not appear to require p53, but reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role in this process, in addition to components of the Jak/Stat signaling pathway. These results suggest that IFN-α-mediated apoptosis requires inhibition of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s) and generation of ROS to activate another signaling pathway(s) that allows this cytokine to stimulate programmed cell death. The human leukemic T-cell line Jurkat, subclone E6 was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (10 units/ml) and streptomycin (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C and 5% CO2.

Reconstituted 2fTGH mutant lines were maintained in the presence of 450 μg/ml G418. Phosphospecific antibody against tyrosine 701 of Stat1 was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA) and used at 1:2000 dilution. Rabbit antiserum to Stat1 (18Larner A.C. David M. Feldman G.M. Igarashi K. Hackett R.H. Webb D.A.S. Sweitzer S.M. Petricoin III, E.F. Finbloom D.S.

(Lake Placid, NY) were used at 1:2500 dilution. Recombinant IFN-α-2a was a gift from Hoffman-LaRoche, Nutley, NJ. Sodium orthovanadate (vanadate) andN-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) were obtained from Sigma. Adherent cells at 30% confluence and Jurkat cells (106 cells/ml) were incubated with medium, IFN-α, vanadate, or the combination of IFN-α plus vanadate at 37 °C for the indicated times. All samples were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate. Lysates were vortexed, incubated on ice for 10 min, and insoluble material cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins (30 μg of whole cell extract) were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Immunoblots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 2fTGH cells were left untreated or stimulated with IFN-α vanadate or IFN-α plus vanadate. Total cellular RNA was isolated using RNAzol B (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX). Antisense RNA probes were synthesized by in vitrotranscription using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [α-32P]UTP (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) (19Petricoin E.F. Hackett R.H. Akai H. Igarashi K. Finbloom D.S. Larner A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4486-4495Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 10 μg of RNA and 32P-labeled riboprobes were incubated overnight in hybridization buffer containing 80% formamide, 40 mmPIPES, pH 6.7, 400 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA at 56 °C followed by digestion with T1 RNase (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C, phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Protected RNA fragments were solubilized in RNA loading buffer (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanole), boiled for 2 min, and resolved by electrophoresis on a 4.5% polyacrylamide-urea gel. Adherent cells plated in six-well plates or suspension cells were diluted to 1 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were left untreated or stimulated with IFN-α, vanadate, or IFN-α plus vanadate, followed by incubation at 37 °C. Cells were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2). Adherent cells were harvested by trypsinization, and detached cells in medium were also collected. Cells were then incubated with 5 μl of annexin V-FITC (PharMingen, Palo Alto, CA) and 5 μl of propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature in the dark, followed by addition of 400 μl of binding buffer. Cells were collected ungated (10,000 events) and analyzed by two-color flow cytometry using a FACScan™ (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Data were further analyzed using CellQuest™ (Becton-Dickinson) to discriminate between apoptoticversus necrotic cells. Cells were plated in 60-mm dishes at 40% confluence and stimulated as described above, and cell extracts were prepared. Caspase-3 activity was assayed in a 150-μl reaction mixture with a caspase-3-specific fluorogenic substrate peptide (Ac-DEVD-AMC) (PharMingen, Palo Alto, CA). The substrate peptide (100 μm) was incubated with 20 μg of cell extract in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 2 h. Fluorescence was measured using a Cytofluor 2350 spectrofluorometer plate reader with an excitation of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm (Millipore, Marlborough, MA). In order to understand the signaling events associated with type I IFN-mediated apoptosis in certain cellular contexts, we searched for conditions that would allow IFN-α to trigger programmed cell death in cells where IFN-α normally exerts only antiproliferative responses. Since protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) modulate both type I IFN signaling and also can play a role in cell survival (20David M. Romero G. Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6593-6599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Petricoin E.F. David M. Igarashi K. Benjamin C. Ling L. Goelz S. Finbloom D.S. Larner A.C. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2416-2424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether vanadate (a PTPase inhibitor) alters the ability of this cytokine to induce an apoptotic response. Human fibrosarcoma 2fTGH cells were incubated with different doses of IFN-α in the absence or presence of vanadate (5 μm) for 48 h, and apoptosis was measured by annexin-V staining (Fig. 1A). Although treatment of cells with IFN-α or vanadate alone did not increase the number of apoptotic cells compared with unstimulated cells, the combination of IFN-α and vanadate caused cells to apoptose. Maximal numbers of apoptotic cells were observed when cells were incubated in 5–10 × 103 units/ml IFN-α (∼40%) in the presence of 5 μm vanadate. These concentrations of IFN-α are also required to achieve maximal antiproliferative actions in 2fTGH cells (data not shown). Similar results were also obtained when we measured apoptosis by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay (data not shown). To explore whether the combination of IFN-α and vanadate stimulates apoptosis in other cells, HeLa cells (a human cervical carcinoma) and Jurkat cells (a T-cell leukemia) (Fig. 1, B and C) were treated with this combination of agents. Incubation of both cell lines with IFN-α and vanadate induced programmed cell death whereas neither compound alone was effective. Unlike 2fTGH cells, HeLa and Jurkat cells required a higher dose of vanadate (25–50 μm) to undergo apoptosis in the presence of IFN-α. These results suggest that the activities of a PTPase(s) might play an important role in determining whether IFN-α causes programmed cell death. To determine if the sensitizing effect of vanadate to IFN-α-mediated programmed cell death was a global response to all cytokines known to stimulate apoptosis, we tested if vanadate could enhance TNF-α-induced apoptosis of 2fTGH cells. Treatment of cells with TNF-α in combination with actinomycin D has been reported to promote apoptosis in these cells (23Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, TNF-α alone does not stimulate cell death. Although incubation of 2fTGH cells with vanadate and IFN-α significantly stimulated cells to apoptose, the combination of TNF-α with vanadate failed to induce apoptosis in these cells (Fig. 2). Incubation of cells with TNF-α and IFN-α also did not induce apoptosis (data not shown). Similar observations were made in HeLa and Jurkat cells incubated with TNF-α and vanadate (data not shown). Thus, the ability of vanadate to prime cells to undergo programmed cell death does not apply to all pro-apoptotic stimulators. To determine whether cells needed to be cultured in the continuous presence of vanadate for IFN-α to stimulate apoptosis, 2fTGH cells were incubated with IFN-α and various doses of vanadate for 6 h, followed by treatment with either medium or IFN-α alone for 40 h (Fig.3A, lanes 1–6). Although incubation of cells with IFN-α and either 5 or 20 μm vanadate for 6 h, followed by 40 h of IFN-α alone, did not significantly increase the number of apoptotic cells, priming with a higher dose of vanadate (50 μm) and IFN-α significantly enhanced apoptosis in the continuous presence of IFN-α (lanes 2 and4 versus lane 6). We also found that 6-h priming of cells with 50 μm vanadate alone followed by a 40-h incubation with IFN-α in the absence of vanadate allowed cells to apoptose (Fig. 3A, lanes 7 and 8). It should be noted that priming of 2fTGH cells for less than 6 h did not induce IFN-α-mediated apoptosis. Additionally, cells did not apoptose when cultured with IFN-α and vanadate for 6 h, followed by low dose vanadate alone for 40-h (data not shown). At this moment, we cannot determine whether this is a transcriptionally or translationally dependent effect. The RNA polymerase inhibitor actinomycin D or the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexamide, even when used at low concentrations for 48 h, were both toxic to cells. It thus appears that incubation of cells with vanadate for a short period (i.e. 6 h) initiates a condition that is irreversible with regard to the ability of IFN-α to stimulate programmed cell death. Vanadate has recently been reported to generate ROS, which play a role in the induction of programmed cell death in certain cell lines (24Ye J. Ding M. Leonard S.S. Robinson V.A. Millecchia L. Zhang X. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Shi X. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 202: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the possible involvement of ROS in IFN-α-inducible apoptosis initiated by priming of cells with high dose vanadate for 6 h, 2fTGH cells were left untreated or pretreated with the free radical scavenger NAC (10 mm) for 30 min, incubated with high dose vanadate (50 μm) for 6 h followed by stimulation with medium, or IFN-α alone for 40-h. NAC was continuously present in the medium of 2fTGH cells for the duration of the experiment (Fig. 3B). Vanadate priming of cells incubated without or with NAC showed a basal level of 5% apoptotic cells. Pretreatment of 2fTGH cells with NAC significantly abrogated the apoptotic effects of vanadate followed by IFN-α compared with vanadate-primed cells stimulated with IFN-α alone (compare 11% versus 32% apoptotic cells, respectively). Cells primed with vanadate followed by IFN-α and NAC treatment were still protected from IFN-α-induced apoptosis (data not shown). These results suggest that generation of ROS induced by vanadate and/or IFN-α and vanadate play a role in sensitizing cells to IFN-α-mediated apoptosis. Caspase-3 activation is one of the hallmarks and commitment steps of programmed cell death (25Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T., Yu, V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar, 26Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). To address whether induction of apoptosis by IFN-α and vanadate correlated with activation of caspases, we measured the activity of caspase-3 in 2fTGH cells, using a fluorogenic peptide substrate. As shown in Fig.4, neither IFN-α nor vanadate stimulated caspase-3 activity in these cells. In contrast, the combination of the two compounds led to the activation of caspase-3 after only 24 h. Maximal caspase-3 activity was detected between 36 and 48 h, which preceded the onset of maximal apoptosis that occurs after 2 days of treatment. In a similar manner, maximal caspase-3 activity was observed in HeLa cells treated with IFN-α and vanadate for 24 and 30 h (data not shown). We also found that treatment of 2fTGH cells with the combination of IFN-α plus vanadate or either treatment alone did not increase caspase-3 RNA levels compared with unstimulated cells when examined up to 24 h (data not shown). This observation indicates that the onset of apoptosis induced by IFN-α and vanadate coincides with caspase-3 activity. Prolonged activation of Jaks and Stats has been reported to correlate with the ability of IFN-α to induce cell cycle arrest in sensitive Daudi cells compared with Daudi cells that are resistant to the antiproliferative effects of this cytokine (27Lee C.-K. Bluyssen H.A.R. Levy D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21872-21877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It is known that incubation of cells with high concentrations of vanadate can stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Stats (28Haque S.J. Wu Q. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Smith J.M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8563-8568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to determine whether priming with vanadate would cause a change in the magnitude or duration of IFN-α-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stats that could account for the apoptotic effects. 2fTGH cells were left untreated or incubated with IFN-α, low dose vanadate, or the combination of both compounds for the indicated times, and cell extracts were prepared. The kinetics and magnitude of Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblot analysis using a phosphotyrosine-specific Stat1 antibody. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 induced by IFN-α was not enhanced by incubation of cells with vanadate over the course of 6 h (Fig.5). Interestingly, the low concentrations of vanadate used in these experiments did not induce Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5, lanes 2, 5,8, and 11). We did not detect enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 when shorter term stimulations were performed between 5 and 30 min or when cells were pretreated with low dose vanadate followed by IFN-α stimulation (data not shown). We also examined tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 and obtained the same results observed with Stat1 in 2fTGH and HeLa cells (data not shown). Since serine phosphorylation of Stat1 is required for maximal transcriptional response of ISGs (29Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar), we analyzed several such RNAs using RNase protection assays (Fig. 6). Vanadate did not augment or prolong expression of ISGs that are activated by ISGF3 (ISG15 and ISG54) via an ISRE element or by Stat1 homodimers (GBP, IRF) via an IFN-γ response (GAS) element. The level of expression of ISGs at 24 h induced by vanadate and IFN-α stimulation were not different from those detected at 18 h (data not shown). We also examined whether vanadate could enhance protein expression levels of the IFN-α/β-inducible protein PKR in 2fTGH cells since this ISG plays a role in sensitizing cells to undergo apoptosis (30Balachandran S. Kim C.N. Yeh W.-C. Mak T.W. Bhalla K. Barber G.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6888-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Stimulation of 2fTGH cells with IFN-α plus vanadate did not augment PKR protein expression when compared with IFN-α treatment alone over the course of 40 h (data not shown). This indicates that apoptosis induced by IFN-α and vanadate likely requires an additional signal besides ISGs.Figure 6Vanadate does not alter expression of ISGs. 2fTGH cells were left untreated or treated with IFN-α (5000 units/ml), vanadate (5 μm), or the combination of IFN-α plus vanadate. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points and total RNA was extracted. Expression of ISG15, ISG54, GBP, and IRF RNAs were determined by RNase protection assay. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA was used as an internal control to normalize equal loading of RNA. I, IFN;V, vanadate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because stimulation of 2fTGH cells with vanadate did not appear to enhance IFN-α-induced gene expression of known ISGs, we wanted to determine whether vanadate alone might induce tyrosine phosphorylation of target proteins that might play a role in IFN-α-induced apoptosis. 2fTGH cells were incubated with low dose vanadate (5 μm) over the course of 30 min, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis. Fig. 7 shows the appearance of two distinct proteins that became tyrosine-phosphorylated upon vanadate stimulation as early as 15 min. The identity of these proteins is unknown; however, we know these proteins are not Stat1, Stat2, and Tyk2 (data not shown). Stimulation of 2fTGH cells with IFN-α plus vanadate did not increase the tyrosine phosphorylation content of these proteins or the appearance of new tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (data not shown). We also could not detect inducible protein tyrosine phosphorylation by IFN-α in other cell lines where this cytokine induces apoptosis (H9 and U266 cell) or cell growth arrest (Jurkat) (data not shown). The fact that increases in tyrosine phosphorylation were not detected in IFN-α-stimulated cells is not surprising because the ability of the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to recognize all tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in total cell extracts is limited. Our results indicate that vanadate modulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of at least two distinct proteins that might be important in sensitizing cells to IFN-α-mediated apoptosis. The experiments shown in Figs. 5 and 6 indicate that alterations in IFN-α stimulation of the Jak/Stat pathway are probably not sufficient to account for the ability of IFN-α and vanadate to stimulate programmed cell death in a variety of cells. However, we wanted to know whether components of the Jak/Stat cascade were necessary for the apoptotic effects of IFN-α. To address this issue, we used 2fTGH mutant lines that do not express Stat1, Stat2, Jak1, or Tyk2. Cells were stimulated with IFN-α plus vanadate or either agent alone and assayed for apoptosis by annexin V staining after 48 h. In the absence of any of these proteins, IFN-α and vanadate failed to stimulate apoptosis (Fig. 8). Elevated annexin V staining was detected in Stat1−/− and Stat2−/− cells incubated with vanadate; however, the reason why this occurs is not clear. To determine if apoptotic function could be restored in these cell variants, the wild type forms of these proteins were expressed in the appropriate deficient mutant cell lines (Fig.9). Expression of the missing protein restored IFN-α- and vanadate-stimulated apoptosis. We also examined whether the kinase activity of either Jak1 or Tyk2 was required for the apoptotic response by reconstituting the variants with kinase-inactive forms of these enzymes (Fig. 9, C and D). Neither kinase-inactive Tyk2 nor Jak1 restored IFN-α- plus vanadate-induced programmed cell death in these lines. The fact that kinase-inactive Tyk2 did not restore the apoptotic response is particularly interesting since it is well documented that IFN-α-stimulated ISGs occur in Tyk2−/− cells that express kinase-dead Tyk2 (31Velazquez L.

https://openalex.org/W1598544178,"The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase PKR (protein kinase dsRNA-dependent) plays an important role in the regulation of protein synthesis by phosphorylating the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2. Through this activity, PKR is thought to mediate the antiviral and antiproliferative actions of interferon. Here, we show that the human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells express an alternatively spliced form of PKR with a deletion of exon 7 (PKRΔE7), resulting in a truncated protein that retains the two dsRNA-binding motifs. PKRΔE7 exhibits a dominant negative function by inhibiting both PKR autophosphorylation and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α-subunit phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays showed that PKRΔE7 is expressed in a broad range of human tissues at variable levels. Interestingly, expression of PKRΔE7 is higher in Jurkat cells than in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, raising the possibility of a role in cell proliferation and/or transformation. Thus, expression of alternatively spliced forms of PKR may represent a novel mechanism of PKR autoregulation with important implications in the control of cell proliferation.

Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Binding of PKR to dsRNA results in its activation by autophosphorylation and subsequently in the phosphorylation of eIF-2α (2Clemens M.J. Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF-2α by PKR on serine 51 leads to an increased affinity of the initiation factor for eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B, also known as guanine exchange factor, and thus increases the proportion of the latter that is trapped as an inactive complex with eIF-2 and GDP (reviewed in Ref. 3Hershey J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The reduction in free eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B results in a fall of the overall rate of guanine nucleotide exchange on the remaining unphosphorylated eIF-2, eventually leading to an inhibition of translation initiation (3Hershey J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). In addition to translational control, PKR has been implicated in signaling pathways leading to transcriptional activation by dsRNA, virus infection, various cytokines, or genotoxic stress (reviewed in Ref. 4Kaufman R.J.

Therefore, it has been suggested that the lack of PKR may be compensated by the expression of other PKR-like molecules whose function is possibly blocked by the expression of the PKR mutants in vitro (2Clemens M.J.

This is supported by the cloning and characterization of PKR-related genes, such as PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase/pancreatic eIF-2α kinase, which functions as an eIF-2α kinase (15Ron D. Harding H.P. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 547-560Google Scholar), and the mouse homologue of the yeast eIF-2α kinase GCN2 (16Berlanga J.J. Santoyo J. De Haro C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, PKR may be the prototype of a family of kinases with overlapping biochemical and biological functions (17Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). Work in many laboratories using in vitro mutagenesis of human and mouse PKR has led to an extensive characterization of the structure-function relationship of the molecule (2Clemens M.J. Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Briefly, in both species the amino-terminal half of PKR contains two RNA-binding motifs (dsRBMs) (2Clemens M.J. Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), which are conserved among most of the RNA-binding proteins (18Fierro-Monti I.N.S. Mathews M.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 241-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the carboxyl-terminal half of PKR is divided into 11 subdomains, which are required for catalytic activity (2Clemens M.J. Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) and are conserved among many serine/threonine protein kinases (19Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar). At the genomic level, the human PKR gene contains 17 exons that vary in size from 18 nucleotides in exon 1 to 840 nucleotides in exon 17 (20Kuhen K.L. Shen X. Carlisle E.R. Richardson A.L. Weier H.U. Tanaka H. Samuel C.E. Genomics. 1996; 36: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas the mouse gene contains 16 exons varying from 35 nucleotides in exon 8 to 750 nucleotides in exon 16 (21Tanaka H. Samuel C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7995-7999Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Despite the tumor suppressor function in vitro, naturally occurring mutants of PKR in tumor cells have not as yet been identified with the exemption of a mutant form of mouse PKR in a pro-B leukemia cell line (22Abraham N. Jaramillo M.L. Duncan P.I. Methot N. Icely P.L. Stojdl D.F. Barber G.N. Bell J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we report the cloning of a point mutant of human PKR (Y176H) from Jurkat leukemia cells encoding for a protein that retains the RNA-binding and catalytic properties of wild type PKRin vitro. We also describe the cloning and characterization of an alternatively spliced form of PKR (PKRΔE7) from Jurkat cells. PKRΔE7 is a splicing product of exon 7 of the human PKRgene, which contains the two dsRBMs and exhibits a dominant negative function in vitro an in vivo. PKRΔE7 is differentially expressed in various types of normal human tissue, and we provide evidence that its expression may play a role in induction of cell proliferation as a result of PKR inactivation. The primers used in RT-PCRs are summarized in Table I. For sequencing of the protein-coding sequence of PKR, 1 μg of RNA isolated by the guanidium thiocyanate method (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63147) Google Scholar) was reverse transcribed using the P303 primer. The single-stranded PKR cDNA was then amplified by PCR using the P504/P304, P501/P301, P502/P302, and P503/P303 sets of primers with denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min for a total of 30 cycles. The PCR products, which spanned the entire protein-coding sequence of PKR, were subcloned into pCR™II (Invitrogen) and sequenced with T7 DNA Polymerase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) or subjected to direct sequencing using the Deaza T7Sequencing™ Kit according to the supplier's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The human WT PKR cDNA was subcloned intoHindIII/BamHI sites of either pcDNA3.0-neo (Invitrogen) or pFLAG-CMV-2 vector (Eastman Kodak Co.). For transient PKRΔE7 expression, the 900-bp NcoI/AccI fragment of the WT PKR in pcDNA3.0-neo or pFLAG-CMV-2 vector was replaced with the corresponding fragment from pCR™II vector carrying the ΔE7 deletion to produce PKRΔE7 or FLAG-PKRΔE7 under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter.

For expression of PKRΔE7 in human tissues, the human multiple tissue cDNA (K1420-1) and the human immune system panel (K1426-1) from CLONTECH were used. The normalized cDNAs were amplified by PCR-denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min for a total of 30 cycles using the P505/P305 set of primers. The PCRs were subjected to agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide or silver staining (24Lomholt B. Frederiksen S. Anal.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy human adults using the Ficoll-Paque® method according to the supplier's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Newly isolated lymphocytes were stimulated with 10 units/ml phytohemagglutinin (Life Technologies) and maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies), and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies) for 3 days. One day before transfection, 0.8 × 106 HeLa S3 or PKR−/− cells were seeded in 6-cm plates. One h before transfection, the cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus containing the bacterial T7 RNA polymerase gene (25Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed using the ratio of 1 μg DNA to 2.5 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) per plate, and cells were incubated in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 5 h. Subsequently, complete medium was added, and cells were grown for an additional 16 h before analysis. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1× phosphate buffer saline, and proteins were extracted with a lysis buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. After incubation on ice for 20 min, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The cytoplasmic supernatant (S10fraction) was transferred to a fresh tube, the protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and stored at −85 °C. For PKR autophosphorylation in vitro, 50–500 μg of protein extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with mouse monoclonal anti-human PKR antibodies (clone F9 or E8; Ref. 26Li S. Nagai K. Koromilas A.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and anti-mouse IgG-agarose beads. PKR immunoprecipitates were equilibrated in 1 × PKR kinase buffer consisting of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.7, 50 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. PKR autophosphorylation was performed in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml activator reovirus dsRNA and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN). After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, the reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography. Alternatively, the in vitro kinase assay of PKR was performed with S10protein extracts in 1× PKR kinase buffer in the conditions described above. The autophosphorylated PKR was then immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-human PKR antibodies, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Rabbit antiserum was produced against a chemically synthesized phosphopeptide ILLSELpSRRRIRS (where pS represents phosphoserine) that contains serine 51 of human eIF-2α. The antibody was purified from rabbit serum by sequence-specific chromatography and was negatively preadsorbed using a nonphosphopeptide corresponding to the site of phosphorylation to remove antibody that is reactive with nonphosphorylated eIF-2α protein. The final product was generated by affinity chromatography using an eIF-2α-derived peptide phosphorylated at serine 51. Protein extracts or PKR immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and proteins were transferred onto nylon ImmobilonTM P membrane (Millipore Corp.). Immunoblots were performed with mouse monoclonal anti-human PKR, anti-FLAG (Kodak; catalog no. IB13025), anti-human eIF-2α antibodies, rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphoserine 51 eIF-2α antibodies (homemade or fromBIOSOURCE, catalog no. 44-728), and rabbit antiserum to TrpE-yeast eIF-2α fusion protein (CM-217) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml using the standard protocol (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.60-18.75Google Scholar). After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:1000 dilution; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), proteins were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantification of the bands in the linear range of exposure was performed by densitometry using the NIH Image 1.54 software. The yeast strains used in this study are summarized in Table II. PKR, PKRΔE7, and PKRLS9ΔE7 in pYES2 vector were transformed into these strains and selected in SD-Trp medium as described (28Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 99-102Google Scholar). Single colonies were picked up and grew in SD-Trp liquid medium at 30 °C to A600 = 1.5, and the liquid cultures were streaked on SGLU and SGAL minimal plates containing 10% glucose and 20% galactose, respectively, and incubated at 30 °C for up to 72 h. The yeast growth was measured by diluting the liquid cultures to A600 = 0.01 in synthetic medium containing 10% galactose, 2% raffinose, and the required amino acid supplement (SGAL). The cultures were incubated at 30 °C for various time periods, and a 0.5-ml liquid culture from each point was used to measure A600.Table IIYeast strainsStrainGenotypeJ110Mat a ura3–52 leu2–3,−112 trp1-Δ63 gcn2Δ〈LEU2〉@leu2H2544Mat a ura3–52 leu2–3,−112 trp1-Δ63 gcn2Δ〈GAL-CYC1-PKR, LEU2〉[email protected]H2543Mat a ura3–52 leu2–3,−112 trp1-Δ63 gcn2Δ〈GAL-CYC1-PKR, LEU2〉[email protected]J80Mat a ura3–52 leu2–3,−112 trp1-Δ63 gcn2Δ sui2Δ p[SUI2, LEU2]J82Mat a ura3–52 leu2–3,−112 trp1-Δ63 gcn2Δ sui2Δ p[SUI2-S51A, LEU2] Open table in a new tab We have reported a diminished PKR activation in various human leukemia cell lines including Jurkat T lymphocytes (26Li S. Nagai K. Koromilas A.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We speculated that PKR inactivation in these cells might be caused by mutations in thePKR gene. To test this possibility, we amplified and sequenced the PKR cDNA from Jurkat cells and normal PBMCs after RT-PCR as described under “Materials and Methods.” Direct sequencing of the PCR products verified the presence of a T to C point mutation in Jurkat PKR cDNA at nucleotide 526 downstream from the initiator ATG (Fig. 1 A), which results in a single substitution of tyrosine 176 to histidine. When the PCR products were subcloned into pCRII vector and sequenced (see “Materials and Methods”), nine out of 10 clones contained the T to C mutation. One clone, however, harbored a 77-bp deletion, which corresponds to the entire exon 7 of the human PKR gene (Fig.1 B). Deletion of exon 7 leads to the conjunction of exons 6 and 8 with a frameshift that introduces a stop codon (TGA) within exon 8 and produces an RNA encoding for a 174 amino acid protein. This truncated protein contains the two dsRBMs of PKR and herein is named PKRΔE7 (Fig. 2).Figure 2Schematic illustration of the alternatively spliced form PKRΔE7. A, the wild type human PKR cDNA contains sequences from 17 exons, where the translation initiation codon ATG and the translation termination codon TAG are located in exon 3 and exon 17, respectively. The Y176H mutation in exon 7 of Jurkat gene is indicated. When exon 7 is deleted by splicing, the reading frame is shifted thereafter and terminates by a newly introduced stop codon TGA. The resulting truncated protein, PKRΔE7, contains the two dsRNA-binding motifs (dsRBM I and II).B, the nucleotide and amino acid sequence translated in the vicinity of the alternative splicing site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We confirmed the expression of the PKRΔE7 RNA in Jurkat cells by an RT-PCR assay (see “Materials and Methods”). The PKRΔE7 PCR product contains a 77-bp deletion and therefore migrates faster than the WT PKR PCR product on agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 3 and 4). The ratio of the band intensities of the two PCR products is proportional to the amount of each PKR transcript within the cells. To examine whether PKRΔE7 expression is unique for Jurkat cells, we performed an RT-PCR assay with RNA from normal PBMCs. We found that PBMCs contain very low levels of PKRΔE7 RNA (<1% of full-length PKR RNA; see also Fig. 8), whereas PKRΔE7 RNA levels in Jurkat cells is about ∼10% of WT PKR transcript (Fig.3 A). We also verified the PKRΔE7 protein expression by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3 B). To facilitate the detection of PKRΔE7, Jurkat cells were treated with IFN-α/β to induce PKR RNA expression. The protein extracts before (lane 2) and after IFN treatment (lane 3) were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with antibodies specific to the N terminus domain of PKR to detect both full-length PKR (top panel) and PKRΔE7 (bottom panel). These experiments showed that PKRΔE7 protein is expressed in Jurkat cells at low levels (lane 2), and its expression is induced after IFN treatment (Fig. 3 B, lane 3).Figure 8Tissue distribution of PKRΔE7 RNA. Human multiple normal tissue cDNA (Stratagene) was used for the detection of PKRΔE7 RNA expression by PCR amplification followed by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining (upper panel). The proportion of PKRΔE7 RNA compared with full-length PKR RNA in each tissue was quantified using the NIH Image 1.54 software (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Characterization of Y176H mutation showed that PKRY176H retains both the dsRNA binding and catalytic activities of WT PKR in vitro (data not shown). As a result of it, we concentrated our efforts on characterizing the function of PKRΔE7. The N terminus domain of PKR is involved in dsRNA-binding (29Patel R.C. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7671-7676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKRΔE7 is similar to an artificially made N terminus-truncated form of PKR, known as p20, which contains the two contiguous dsRBMs. p20 can bind to dsRNA (30Clarke P.A. Pe'ery T. Ma Y. Mathews M.B.

Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9445-9449Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Based on this, we wished to examine the ability of PKRΔE7 to self-associate and associate with WT PKR in the presence and absence of dsRNA. To do so, we constructed a fusion protein of PKRΔE7 bearing the FLAG epitope in the N terminus end. When FLAG-PKRΔE7 and PKRΔE7 were transiently co-expressed into HeLa cells, an equal amount of the two proteins was co-imunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig.4 A, lane 8), confirming their ability to self-associate. In similar assays, an equal amount of endogenous WT PKR (Fig. 4 B,top panel, lane 1) and PKRΔE7 (bottom panel, lane 1) was found to associate FLAG-PKRΔE7 (middle panel, lane 1). However, treatment with micrococcal nuclease (MN) diminished the association of FLAG-PKRΔE7 with WT PKR (top panel,lane 2) without affecting its association with PKRΔE7 (bottom panel, lane 2). These data suggested that self-association of PKRΔE7 may take place in the absence of dsRNA, whereas its association with full-length PKR is dsRNA-dependent. To further investigate this possibility, we used a FLAG-PKRΔE7 construct bearing the LS9 mutation (substitutions of alanine 66 and alanine 68 to glycine 66 and proline 68), which completely abolishes dsRNA binding (34Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Co-expression of FLAG-PKRLS9ΔE7 and PKRΔE7 in HeLa cells and immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody revealed the lack of association of FLAG-PKRΔE7 with either PKRΔE7 (lanes 3 and 4, bottom row) or the endogenous PKR (lanes 3 and 4,top row). Since the LS9 mutation may affect the conformation of the dsRNA-binding domain of PKR (34Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), these data suggested that the integrity of dsRNA-binding domain is essential for PKRΔE7 self-association and association with full-length PKR. In these experiments, we noticed that a higher amount of FLAG-PKRΔE7 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies after MN treatment. One plausible explanation is that binding of RNA to FLAG-PKRΔE7 impedes the accessibility of the antibody to FLAG epitope"

We have shown previously that IGF-I protects these cells from apoptosis induced by interleukin-3 withdrawal but does not promote proliferation. IGF-I induced a rapid and transient activation of JNK that peaked at 40 min that was paralleled by a transient and robust phosphorylation of c-Jun. p38 was constitutively phosphorylated in FL5.12/WT cells. Activation of the JNK pathway by IGF-I occurred in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors and could be enhanced by anisomycin. Analysis of a series of FL5.12 cells expressing mutated IGF-IRs and analysis of 32D/IGF-IR cells showed that neither the C terminus of the receptor nor IRS-1 and IRS-2 were required for JNK activation, although tyrosine 950 was essential for full activation.

IGF-I-mediated protection from apoptosis in FL5.12/WT cells was completely suppressed by dicumarol and partially suppressed by a p38 inhibitor. In the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, treatment with dicumarol also induced apoptosis.

The signaling pathways activated by the IGF-IR have been extensively studied, and it appears that there is considerable overlap in the pathways used for all of the receptor functions. One major signaling pathway activated by the IGF-IR is through its interaction with IRS-1 or IRS-2 leading to activation of PI 3-kinase and AKT (3Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R.

Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6711-6718Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In the IL-3-dependent cell line FL5.12, which we have previously used as a model to study IGF-IR-mediated suppression of apoptosis in response to IL-3 withdrawal, two mutants of the IGF-IR that could not suppress apoptosis could still activate PI 3-kinase and AKT (21O'Connor R. Kauffmann-Zeh A. Liu Y. Lehar S. Evan G.I. Baserga R. Blattler W.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the AKT pathway is not sufficient for suppression of apoptosis by the IGF-IR in these cells. The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family has been investigated for its contribution to anti-apoptotic signaling. However, although IGF-I induces ERK phosphorylation, this is not sufficient to mediate the PI 3-kinase-independent anti-apoptotic activity of the IGF-IR (20Kulik G. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6711-6718Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar,22Esposito D.L. Blakesley V.A. Koval A.P. Scrimgeour A.G. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2979-2988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another candidate pathway that has not been investigated much in IGF-IR anti-apoptotic signaling is that controlled by the MAP kinase-related stress-activated kinases (SAPKs), consisting of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38 kinase. Although the role of SAPKs in either promoting or suppressing apoptosis appears to be quite complex (reviewed in Ref. 14Moule S.K. Welsh G.I. Edgell N.J. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. Denton R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7713-7719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), there is considerable evidence to support a role for these proteins in transformation (23Raitano A.B.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2634-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), a function that overlaps with the anti-apoptotic function of the IGF-IR. JNKs have also recently been strongly associated with the differentiation of T lymphocyte subsets (25Dong C. Yang D.D. Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Xu J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The role of SAPKs in promoting apoptosis or cell survival appears to depend on the stimulus a cell receives. Neurons activate JNKs in response to growth factor withdrawal (26Le-Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), and fibroblasts derived from mice with two isoforms of JNK knocked out (JNK1 and JNK2) are more resistant to UV-induced apoptosis than their wild type littermates (27Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). However, the JNK kinase SEK can protect thymocytes from apoptosis (28Nishina H. Radvanyi L. Raju K. Sasaki T. Kozieradzki I. Penninger J.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3416-3420PubMed Google Scholar), and in a biphasic response to TNF-α there is a correlation with prolonged activation of JNK and induction of apoptosis, whereas there is a correlation with transient activation of JNK and suppression of apoptosis (29Roulston A. Reinhard C. Amiri P. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10232-10239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Transient activation of JNK by TNF-α in HeLa cells could be inhibited by the quinone reductase inhibitor dicumarol, and this lead to potentiation of apoptosis (30Cross J.V. Deak J.C. Rich E.A. Qian Y. Lewis M. Parrott L.A. Mochida K. Gustafson D. Vande Pol S. Templeton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31150-31154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), suggesting that transient JNK activation is associated with the survival of tumor cells. Activation of JNK and p38 by cytokines such as erythropoietin has also been associated more tightly with cell survival than with apoptosis (31Jacobs-Helber S.M. Ryan J.J. Sawyer S.T. Blood. 2000; 96: 933-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-I has been shown to suppress JNK activity and activate p38 in response to high glucose-induced stress in neuroblastoma cells (32Cheng H.L. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14560-14565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and to suppress prolonged JNK activation by anisomycin in fibroblasts (33Okubo Y. Blakesley V.A. Stannard B. Gutkind S. Le Roith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25961-25966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast transient JNK activation has recently been shown to occur in response to IGF-I stimulation of the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 (34Monno S. Newman M.V. Cook M. Lowe Jr., W.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the consequences of JNK activation by IGF-I for regulation of apoptosis, cell growth, or transformation by the IGF-IR are not known. In this work we investigated SAPK activation by the IGF-IR and further investigated the effects of dicumarol on the anti-apoptotic activity of the IGF-IR using FL5.12 cells that overexpress the wild type (WT) IGF-IR and that are protected by IGF-I from IL-3 withdrawal. We show that JNK is transiently activated by IGF-I stimulation leading to phosphorylation of c-Jun, whereas p38 is constitutively phosphorylated in these cells. JNK activation by IGF-I does not require PI 3-kinase or AKT activation. Dicumarol could block JNK activation and also abrogated suppression of apoptosis by IGF-I but did not affect p38 activity or AKT activation. Similar concentrations of dicumarol induced apoptosis in the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7. These data suggest that IGF-I-mediated activation of JNK plays a role in suppression of apoptosis by the IGF-IR and that the JNK inhibitor dicumarol can induce apoptosis in tumor cells that are dependent on IGF-IR-mediated survival signals. Recombinant IGF-I was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). The anti-ERK2, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-SAPK, anti-SAPK, anti-phospho-p38, anti-p38, anti-AKT, anti-phospho-AKT antibodies, and the non-radioactive SAPK assay kit were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-phospho-Jun, anti-Shc polyclonal, anti-Grb-2, anti-Gab-2 and anti-PI 3-kinase p85 subunit antibodies were all obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). An anti-Shc monoclonal antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The p38, ERK, and PI 3-kinase inhibitors PD98049, SB203580, and LY294002, respectively, were purchased from Calbiochem, and dicumarol was from Sigma. The monoclonal anti-actin antibody and the FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, antibody used for immunofluorescence, was purchased from Sigma. FL5.12 and 32D cells were maintained in Iscove's modified defined medium (IMDM) supplemented with 1 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (all from BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium), and 10% (v/v) conditioned medium (CM) from the IL-3-producing cell line WEHI-3B. FL5.12 cells that overexpress the wild type (WT) and mutant IGF-IRs and the empty pcDNA3 vector-expressing Neo cells were described previously (21O'Connor R. Kauffmann-Zeh A. Liu Y. Lehar S. Evan G.I. Baserga R. Blattler W.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mm glutamine, 10% serum FBS. FL5.12/WT cells were cultured at 3 × 105 cells/ml in medium containing IL-3 for 24 h, washed three times in serum-free medium, and then cultured at 5 × 105 cells/ml in IMDM containing 5% FBS (2 ml/well) in 24-well plates. IGF-I (100 ng/ml) or IL-3 (WEHI CM 10%) was added to triplicate cultures. At the indicated times, 200-μl aliquots were removed from each well, and viability was determined by counting live and dead cells after trypan blue staining. The percentage of viable cells was calculated from the total number of cells per well, and all data are presented as the mean of triplicate cultures for each culture condition. Survival assays were performed in medium supplemented with 5% FBS to reduce the amount of IGF-I and IGF-II that is available in FBS that would mask the effects of exogenously added IGF-I. IGF-I- and IL-3-mediated suppression of apoptosis was also assayed in the presence of a number of inhibitors of signal transduction pathways. To inhibit PI 3-kinase, ERKs, p38, or JNK, respectively, LY294002 (10 μm), PD98049 (50 μm), SB203580 (10 μm), or dicumarol (50, 100, or 150 μm) was added to cultures that were exposed to IGF-I, IL-3, or 5% FBS. Cell viability was monitored by trypan blue exclusion over a 72-h period, and the data are presented as described above. FL5.12 cells overexpressing WT and mutant forms of the IGF-IR were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml in IMDM containing 10% FBS plus 10% WEHI CM and cultured for 24 h, washed three times in serum-free medium, and then starved for 3.5 h in serum-free medium. Following serum starvation 7 × 106 cells were stimulated with IGF-I (100 ng/ml) for up to 60 min, or not, and then washed in cold PBS. Cells were then lysed in 40 μl of ice-cold SDS-lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm Tris, 50 mmNaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmaprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.6). Debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and samples were then denatured by boiling in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by 12 or 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were blocked in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.6) with 5% milk for 30 min at room temperature. Primary phospho-specific antibodies were diluted 1/1000 in TBS-T, 5% goat serum, and all other antibodies were diluted 1/1000 in TBS-T, 5% milk and incubated for 1.5 h or overnight. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako Glostrup, Denmark) were used for detection using chemiluminescence with the ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or with the Supersignal reagent (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation cell lysates (107 cells in 500 μl per sample) were pre-cleared with 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads for 1 h, followed by incubation with specific antibodies (5 μg) for 18 h. Protein G-agarose beads (20 μl) were then added for 3 h, and the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer before boiling in gel sample buffer and separation of the released proteins by SDS-PAGE. Proteins present in the immunoprecipitates were identified by Western blotting as described above. A non-radioactive kinase assay kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences was used to assay JNK activity in FL5.12 cells. This kit utilized glutathione S-transferase-Jun beads that pull-down JNK protein from cell lysates. Cell lysates from cells that had been stimulated with IGF-I under different conditions, or that were not stimulated, were incubated with glutathioneS-transferase-Jun beads for 18 h, washed, and then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in kinase reaction buffer according to the manufacturer's instruction. The beads were then boiled in SDS sample buffer and pelleted at 3,000 × g for 3 min. Proteins in the supernatants were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated Jun was detected by Western blotting with an anti-phospho-Jun antibody, which specifically detects JNK phosphorylation on serine 63 of c-Jun. MCF-7 cells were seeded at 1 × 104 cells/ml in 24-well plates and cultured for 24 h. Dicumarol was then added to the cells at various concentrations. These and control cultures cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 24, 48, or 72 h. At the indicated times cultures were photographed and then washed. The remaining cells were stained with Giemsa, and the viable cells in each well were counted by microscopic analysis. Cell architecture was also analyzed by immunofluorescence staining of actin in the cells. Cells were fixed in 100% methanol at −20 °C for 5 min and then blocked in blocking solution consisting of 2.5% goat serum in PHEM buffer (60 mm Pipes, 25 mm Hepes, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.9) for 1 h. An anti-actin monoclonal antibody was then added to cells for 1.5 h at room temperature. After washing, a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, diluted 1/100 in blocking solution, and Hoechst dye (0.5 μg/ml) were incubated with cells for a further 1.5 h at room temperature. The cells were washed again and photographed using a SPOT-RT digital camera mounted on a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Activation of the MAP kinase family members in response to IGF-I has been demonstrated in different cell types (35Swantek J.L. Baserga R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3163-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the activation of SAPK by the IGF-IR in cells where IGF-I mediates suppression of apoptosis has not been studied. To investigate this, we used FL5.12 cells overexpressing the wild type IGF-IR (FL5.12/WT) that are efficiently protected from IL-3 withdrawal by IGF-I (21O'Connor R. Kauffmann-Zeh A. Liu Y. Lehar S. Evan G.I. Baserga R. Blattler W.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). FL5.12/WT cells were removed from IL-3 for 3.5 h and then stimulated with IGF-I or left unstimulated, and Western blotting was performed using antibodies against the active/phosphorylated forms of the MAP kinase and SAPK proteins. Fig.1 A demonstrates that ERKs 1 and 2 are activated upon IGF-I stimulation, and this is in agreement with published studies (17Peruzzi F. Prisco M. Dews M. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Romano G. Calabretta B. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7203-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Levels of p38 phosphorylation are high in unstimulated cells and remain at similar levels in response to IGF-I stimulation. This finding is in contrast to that observed with IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of p38 in neuroblastoma cells (32Cheng H.L. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14560-14565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and suggests that p38 is constitutively active in FL5.12 cells or, alternatively, that its phosphorylation is induced very rapidly by brief starvation from IL-3. JNK phosphorylation is very low or not detectable in FL5.12/WT cells but is greatly increased in response to IGF-I stimulation of cells at 20 and 40 min (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, although the levels of JNK2 (56 kDa) protein seem to be higher than JNK1 (46 kDa) in these cells, the increase in phosphorylation is predominantly in JNK1 rather than in JNK2 (Fig. 1 A). JNK activation is not detectable in mock-transfected FL5.12/Neo cells compared with FL5.12/WT cells (Fig.2 B). An increase in phosphorylation of c-Jun is also detectable between 20 and 60 min in FL5.12/WT cells, and this is also not detectable in FL5.12/Neo cells (Fig. 2 B). JNK and c-Jun are also robustly phosphorylated in response to stimulation with IL-3 for 15 min (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that the increase in JNK activation and Jun phosphorylation in FL5.12/WT cells was due to a stress response caused by withdrawal of IL-3, cells were monitored for JNK activation at different times up to 60 min in the absence of any stimulation. Results shown in Fig. 1 C compare levels of c-Jun phosphorylation in starved cells with levels of c-Jun phosphorylation following IGF-I stimulation for 20 min. This demonstrates that although low levels of JNK activity are detected in FL5.12 cells upon IL-3 withdrawal, these levels do not increase over time, whereas stimulation with IGF-I induces a robust activation of JNK. By having established that IGF-I induces JNK activation in FL5.12 cells, we were next interested in examining the time course of JNK activation and c-Jun phosphorylation. This was investigated using a non-radioactive assay kit that is based on an antibody that specifically detects phosphorylation on serine 63 of Jun, which is phosphorylated by JNK. Fig. 1 D shows that JNK phosphorylation activity peaks between 20 and 40 min of IGF-I stimulation and begins to decrease by 60 min. This is indicative of a transient activation of JNK in response to IGF-I and is different from prolonged activation of JNK induced by anisomycin and stress signals (36Zanke B.W. Boudreau K. Rubie E. Winnett E. Tibbles L.A. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Liu F.F. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 606-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Thus, overall these data demonstrate that IGF-I induces transient phosphorylation of both ERKs and JNK in FL5.12/WT cells and that p38 is constitutively active in these cells. Transient activation of JNKs has been associated with suppression of apoptosis in response to TNF-α in T lymphocytes (29Roulston A. Reinhard C. Amiri P. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10232-10239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), whereas dicumarol blocks JNK and NF-κB activation leading to potentiation of apoptosis in HeLa cells (30Cross J.V. Deak J.C. Rich E.A. Qian Y. Lewis M. Parrott L.A. Mochida K. Gustafson D. Vande Pol S. Templeton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31150-31154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether the activation of JNK by IGF-I in FL5.12/WT cells shown above is associated with suppression of apoptosis, we sought to block JNK activation using dicumarol and also to determine the effects of dicumarol on IGF-I-mediated suppression of apoptosis. Previously, we have shown that IGF-I protects FL5.12/WT cells from IL-3 withdrawal, without promoting a proliferative response (21O'Connor R. Kauffmann-Zeh A. Liu Y. Lehar S. Evan G.I. Baserga R. Blattler W.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To determine if dicumarol had an affect on IGF-I-mediated suppression of apoptosis FL5.12/WT cells were cultured in the presence of IL-3, IGF-I, or 5% FBS (control) with or without dicumarol at different concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 μm. The results shown in Fig.2 A demonstrate that IGF-I-mediated suppression of apoptosis is drastically inhibited by 100 μm dicumarol, as is suppression of apoptosis afforded by 5% FBS in the control cells (Fig.2 A). The viability of cells cultured in the presence of IL-3 is not altered significantly by incubation with 100 μmdicumarol (Fig. 2 A), although we did notice that the proliferation of cells cultured in the presence of IL-3 was suppressed and that higher concentrations of dicumarol (150 and 200 μm) lead to loss of viability in IL-3 cultures (not shown). A dose-response curve showing the effects of dicumarol on IGF-I-mediated suppression of apoptosis is shown in Fig. 2 B. This demonstrates that in the presence of 25 μm dicumarol there is no effect on IGF-I-mediated anti-apoptotic activity, but at 50 μm there is some abrogation of IGF-I activity, with a progressive abrogation at 75 μm to complete inhibition at 100 μm dicumarol. We next tested the effects"

Both the proteolytic and chaperone activities of the Clp ATPases depend on ATP hydrolysis. More recent data demonstrate that chaperone and protease activities can occur concurrently in the ClpAP complex. For example, the ClpP protein is able to restore the chaperone activity of a ClpA mutant carrying an amino acid substitution in its N-terminal ATP-binding site. ClpA(K220V) is unable to activate RepA on its own, but the presence of ClpP restores its ability to activate RepA (10Pak M. Hoskins J.R. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. J. Biol.

It has been shown by site-directed mutagenesis that the first ATP-binding site of ClpA, located near the N-terminal end of the protein, is responsible for hexamer formation and chaperone activity, whereas the second ATP-binding site is essential for ATP hydrolysis (10Pak M.

Interestingly, in the case of yeast Hsp104 the roles are apparently reversed; the first ATP-binding site is responsible for ATPase activity and the second site is essential for oligomerization (11Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to ClpA, ClpB, or Hsp104, the ClpX ATPase possesses only one ATP-binding site, highly homologous to the one responsible for hydrolysis (21Gottesman S. Clark W.P. de Crecy-Lagard V. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In this paper we investigate the putative role of Zn(II) in ClpX structure and function. We show that ClpX binds Zn(II) and that such an effect is important for binding of ATP to ClpX, and its proper oligomerization. These events influence binding of ClpX to ClpP and, consequently, the proteolysis reaction catalyzed by the ClpXP protease. Plasmid pBAD24, which contains the clpX wild type gene, was constructed as follows. The coding sequence of clpX was amplified from DNA extracted from Escherichia coli B178 by means of two oligonucleotides (synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc.) derived from the published sequence of clpX (21Gottesman S. Clark W.P. de Crecy-Lagard V. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal primer was 5′- GGTTCTCATGACAGATAAACGCAAAGATGGC-3′, introducing a BspHI restriction site and the C- terminal primer was 5′-CCAAGCTTCTGCAGTTATTCACCAGATGCCTGTTGCGC-3′, carrying aPstI restriction site. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out in a reaction volume of 50 μl. The annealing temperature was 60 °C and 35 cycles were performed. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the NcoI-PstI sites of the pBAD24 expression vector. The sequence of clpX was confirmed by restriction analysis and automated sequencing using the ABI Prism 310 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Applied Biosystems). The resulting plasmid construct was used to transform E. coli DH5α (F-, ϕdlacZΔ M15,ΔlacZYA-argF, U169, deoR, recA1, end A1, phoA, hsdR17, supE44, λ- thi-1, gyrA96, relA1) and CJ236 (dut1, ung1, thi1, relA1/pCJ105, Cm r )strains for overproduction and mutagenesis, respectively. TheclpX expression phagemid was mobilized with VCSM13 (Stratagene) in strain CJ236 and amino acid substitutions were generated using the site-directed mutagenesis method of Kunkel et al. (23Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 370-382Google Scholar). The cysteine to serine substitutions at residues 15, 18, 37, and 40 were introduced using the following oligonucleotides (synthesized by Interactiva Biotechnologie): C15S, 5′-GCCGCAAAAAGAGGAATACAGCAATTT-3′; C18S, 5′- GCTTTTGCCGCTAAAAGAGCAATAC-3′; C37S, 5′-ACACATTCGGAGATATACACG-3′; C40S, 5′-CATAAATCAACAGATTCGTCGGAGAT-3′. All residues downstream from codon C40S were as in wild type ClpX. The DNA sequence was verified by automated sequencing using the ABI-Prism 310 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc., Applied Biosystems). In all experiments described in this paper highly purified proteins (95% or greater purity) were used. All steps of purification were carried out at 0–4 °C. Thirty grams of ClpX overexpressing E. coli cells were lysed in 170 ml of X buffer composed of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 200 mmKCl, 5 mm DTT,110% (w/v) sucrose, 300 mm spermidine-HCl, and 1 mg/ml lysosyme. To ensure complete lysis, following a 45-min incubation at 0 °C, the lysate was transferred to 42 °C for an additional 5 min and the concentration of salt was increased to 1 m. The lysate was centrifuged in a Beckman R35 rotor at 20,000 rpm for 30 min at 0 °C. Proteins in the supernatant (160 ml) were precipitated with ammonium sulfate (0.29 g/ml) and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 45 min at 0 °C using the same rotor. The pellet was resuspended and dialyzed for 6 h at 0 °C against buffer X1, composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.01% Triton X-100. The extract was centrifuged in an R35 Beckman rotor at 25,000 rpm for 4 min at 0 °C. The supernatant was applied onto a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (2.5 × 20 cm) which had previously been equilibrated with buffer X1. After extensive washing (12 h at 30 ml/min) of the Q-Sepharose column with buffer X1, the bound proteins were eluted with a salt gradient (2 × 300 ml) from 100 to 450 mm KCl. Fractions containing the ClpX protein were pooled (50 ml) and applied onto a hydroxylapatite column (Bio-Rad; 1 × 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer X1. The bound proteins were eluted with potassium phosphate in buffer X1 (2 × 25 ml;) from 0 to 300 mmKPi (pH 7.2). Pooled fractions containing the ClpX protein (15 ml) were dialyzed against buffer X2, composed of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm DTT, and 0.01% Triton X-100 and applied onto a Resource MonoQ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (6 ml). A linear gradient of KCl (2 × 30 ml) from 100 to 400 mm (1 ml/min flow rate) was used to elute ClpX from the column using an fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) system. Fractions containing homogenous ClpX were pooled together (7 ml) and Bradford Bio-Rad assay was performed to estimate the protein concentration as 5 mg/ml. SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1 × 30 cm) and Biosil TSK-3000 (Beckman; 7 × 300 mm) were used to assess protein purity. The ClpP was purified as described by Wojtkowiak et al.(24Wojtkowiak D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22609-22617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GroEL protein was purified as described by Ziemienowiczet al. (25Ziemienowicz A. Skowyra D. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7435-7452Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The standard protease assay reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 3H-labeled λO protein (0.5 μg, 40,000 cpm), ClpX (0.2 μg), ClpP (2 μg) in 20 mmHepes/KOH (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 0.5% Brij 58, 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction was assembled on ice, then transferred to 30 °C for the desired time. The reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 10% (v/v)). After centrifugation (10 min, 5,000 × g, at 4 °C) the radioactivity present in the soluble fraction was estimated following the addition of toluene/Triton X-100 scintillation fluid. Proteolysis was carried out in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 0.5% Brij 58. Each assay included 5 μg of ClpP, 10 μg of ClpXZn(II), or ClpXZn(−), or ClpXΔCys, and 5 μg of the λO substrate. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C, and at the desired times, 25-μl portions were withdrawn and processed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The relative amount of non-hydrolyzed protein was estimated using densitometry (Bio-Rad).

Open table in a new tab The ATP binding and hydrolysis assays were done according to details described under “Materials and Methods.” Binding (400 pmol) and hydrolysis of ATP by ClpX Zn(II) was assumed as 100%. Reactions were carried out in a volume of 25 μl. Samples contained 20 μg of ClpX or ClpXΔCys protein and 1.5 mm [α-32P]ATP in a buffer composed of 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8). After 15 min of incubation at 0 °C, samples were filtrated through nitrocellulose filters, and washed with 500 μl of the above buffer. Radioactivity of bound ATP was quantified by liquid scintillation counting (27Hupp T.R. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13128-13136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured according to the colorimetric method of Lanzetta et al. (28Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.8), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl in a final reaction volume of 50 μl. Samples contained 20 μg of ClpX or ClpXΔCys protein and 4 mmATP. The reactions were stopped by addition of 800 μl of malachite green (0.034%) and ammonium molybdate (10.5 g/liter in 1 nHCl) mixture and 100 μl of 34% citric acid. Absorption at 660 nm was measured after 30 min of incubation at room temperature. Results were compared with the calibration curve prepared for the phosphate salt (28Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). The sensitive ELISA assay used for monitoring protein-protein interactions has been previously described in detail by Wawrzynow et al. (4Wawrzynow A. Wojtkowiak D. Marszalek J. Banecki B. Jonsen M. Graves B. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The reacting components (100 μl) were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in buffer B (25 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.6), 150 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mm DTT) before loading onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 sizing column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same buffer. The chromatography was carried out at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min (room temperature) using Gold HPLC system (Beckman) equipped with a diode array detector. In the case where no ATP (or 0.2 mm) was used in the column buffer, eluting proteins were monitored using absorption at 280 nm. Fractions were collected and the presence of protein was visualized following SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The relative amount of protein was estimated using densitometry (Bio-Rad). The Superdex 200 column was calibrated with the following Bio-Rad molecular weight standards: thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17.5 kDa). Purified GroEL was also used for the estimation of the molecular weight of ClpP·ClpX complex. Increasing amounts of PMPS (p-hydroxymercuriphenylsulfonic acid), at a concentration 1 mm, were added to a sample containing 600 μl of 5 μm ClpX. The reactants were mixed and the absorbance at 500 nm was measured. Before addition of the first aliquot of PMPS, the spectrophotometer was adjusted to the zero absorbance value. PAR (4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol) was present in the cuvette at 0.1 mm throughout the measurements. The absorption coefficient for the (PAR)2·ZN(II) complex at 500 nm is ε = 6.6 × 104m−1cm−1 (29Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Schachman H.K. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14793-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ClpX was denatured in the buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, and 8 m urea. In order to remove the zinc ions the same buffer supplemented with 10 mm EDTA was exchanged several times. The renaturation was carried out upon slow dialysis in the same buffer but in the absence of urea and EDTA. CD spectra measurements were carried out using a Jasco-J500 CD spectrophotometer in 1-mm cuvettes at 25 °C, in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm KCl, and 25 mm NaCl. The IR spectra of ClpX Zn(II), ClpXΔCys, and ClpX Zn(−) were collected as described previously (30Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14840-14848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This was performed using a AAS 30 Carl Zeis Jena spectrometer. ClpX is a molecular chaperone which can also work as a specificity factor for the ClpP protease (4Wawrzynow A. Wojtkowiak D. Marszalek J. Banecki B. Jonsen M. Graves B. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 24Wojtkowiak D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22609-22617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It contains a single ATP-binding site, a substrate-binding domain called “sensor and substrate discrimination” or SSD domain (31Smith C.K. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6678-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and a putative Zn finger motif, containing four cysteines, of unknown function. Quantitation of the released Zn(II) ions, upon chelating with PMPS, and by atomic absorption showed that one Zn(II) ion is bound to each monomer of ClpX (Table I and Fig.1). To determine how many Zn(II) molecules bind to ClpX, we incubated a highly purified ClpX protein preparation, fully active in the λO proteolysis assay (24Wojtkowiak D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22609-22617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with PMPS, known to release Zn(II) from zinc-binding proteins (30Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14840-14848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The formation of a mercaptide bond between the free Cys residue and PMPS can be monitored by absorbance at 250 nm. The addition of the high affinity metallochrome indicator PAR, which changes color (absorbance at 500 nm) after the formation of the PAR·Zn(II) complex, allowed the monitoring of the amount of Zn(II) released from ClpX after PMPS treatment (Fig. 1). Control experiments, using atomic absorption, show that treatment of ClpX with PMPS (see “Materials and Methods” for details) leads to the complete removal of Zn(II) from the ClpX protein (Table I).Table IThe molecular ratio of zinc ligand complexed with ClpX protein determined by atomic absorbanceProteinMoles Zn/mol ClpXClpX Zn(II)0.95ClpX Zn(−)<0.05ClpX ΔCys∼0 Open table in a new tab Using site-directed in vitro mutagenesis procedures, we replaced the four cysteine residues at positions 15, 18, 37, 40 with serine. As predicted, the resulting mutant, termed ClpXΔCys, does not bind Zn(II) (Fig. 1 and Table I). Release of Zn(II) ions from ClpX by either PMPS or a denaturation and renaturation procedure (see “Materials and Methods”) does not lead to major changes in the secondary structure of the ClpX protein, as judged from the CD spectra (Fig. 2). Also, in the case of the ClpXΔCys mutant the ClpX secondary structure is largely unaffected (Fig. 2), suggesting that both wild type and mutant proteins fold in an overall similar fashion. If the zinc-binding domain is found predominantly in a β-sheet or loop structure, it could be unfolded in the unliganded state with little effect on the CD spectrum of the full-length protein. The application of a more sensitive approach, namely infrared absorbance spectroscopy, suggests that the differences in secondary structure between ClpX, ClpX treated with PMPS, and ClpXΔCys mutant are indeed minor (Fig.3). Thus, CD and IR spectroscopy cannot detect the local conformational changes of ClpX, which should occur following the release of Zn(II) from the ClpX protein. However, the release of Zn(II) from ClpX partially inhibits the ATP-dependent hydrolysis of the λO protein substrate by the ClpXP protease (Fig. 4). This partial activity of the PMPS-treated ClpX could be due to replacement of the zinc ligand with PMPS, which forms a tight complex with cysteine or/and the formation of S-S bridges between the free Cys residues, which in turn could stabilize the ClpX Zn(−) apo-protein structure, and thus partially compensate for the loss of Zn(II). Consistent with this interpretation, for the ClpXΔCys mutant protein the λO proteolysis reaction is completely blocked (Fig. 4). Since the four cysteines are substituted with serines, the stabilizing effect of PMPS or potential disulfide bond formation should not occur. In a control experiment we showed that the ClpXP proteolytic activity is partially inhibited by the presence of increasing concentrations of different divalent cations. It turns out that neither Mg(II) nor Co(II) ions exert an inhibitory effect on ClpXP proteolytic activity, whereas either Ca(II) or Zn(II) ions present in millimolar concentrations partially inhibit ClpXP proteolytic activity (results not shown). Partial inhibition of ClpXPs proteolytic activity in the presence of a high concentration of Zn(II) (1 mol of ClpX to 100 or 1000 mol of Zn(II)) is probably due to the partial ClpX precipitation under these conditions (results not shown).Figure 3The original infrared absorbance spectrum collected for ClpX Zn(II) (a), and the difference spectra between ClpX Zn(II)/ClpX Zn(−) (b), or ClpX Zn(II)/(ClpXΔCys (c).

Each assay included 5 μg of ClpP, 10 μg of ClpX Zn(II) (filled squares), ClpX Zn(−) (filled circles), or ClpXΔCys (filled triangles) and 5 μg of the λO substrate.

The amount of λO which was left after hydrolysis was analyzed densitometrically.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Quantitative analysis of the specific activity of the ClpX protein in the λO proteolytic assay shows that during the various steps of ClpX purification there is a partial loss of ClpX activity (result not shown). This result could be due to a partial loss of the Zn(II) cation. To bypass this potential problem, we elaborated a new method for ClpX purification which ended up with fully active ClpX protein complexed with Zn(II) (see “Materials and Methods” for details). The identity of ClpX was verified by N-terminal sequencing analysis and Western blot analysis (results not shown). Using this new purification procedure, we were able to obtain ∼35 mg of 98% pure ClpX Zn(II) protein starting from 30 g of ClpX overproducing bacteria. Fig. 5 A shows that, as judged by the ELISA technique, ClpX Zn(II) strongly interacts with the ClpP proteolytic subunit only in the presence of ATP. When the ClpX protein was unfolded by 8 m urea and then folded back in the absence of Zn(II), it possessed a substantially reduced affinity for the ClpP protein (Fig. 5 B). The subsequent addition of Zn(II) to such a ClpX preparation restored the proteins ability to form a stable complex with ClpP. Moreover, only in the presence of Zn(II) this reaction clearly was ATP-dependent (Fig.5 B). These ELISA results have been complemented by size exclusion chromatographic studies. The apparent molecular mass of the ClpP/ClpX Zn(II) heterocomplex is estimated to be 700–800 kDa, assuming an overall spherical shape for its structure (Fig.6 and results not shown). Its Stokes radius is slightly lower than that of the GroEL protein, whose molecular mass is ∼800 kDa (results not shown). A similar high molecular weight structure was previously described for the ClpP·ClpA complex (14Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Kocsis E. Trus B. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 32Maurizi M.R. Experientia. 1992; 48: 178-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and recently for the ClpP·ClpX complex (17Grimaud R. Kessel M. Beuron F. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12476-12481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). As in the case of the ClpAP protease, the formation of the oligomeric ClpP/ClpX Zn(II) structure requires the continuous presence of ATP,i.e. ATP must be present in both the premixture and mobile phase buffers (Fig. 6 and results not shown). The data presented in Fig. 6 also show that ClpX Zn(II) alone, in the absence of ATP, or in the presence of low concentrations of ATP (0.2 mm, sufficient for binding of ClpX to ClpP), already behaves as an oligomer. Judging from the shape of its HPLC profile, a mixture of various ClpX Zn(II) oligomeric forms probably exists. The HPLC profiles of ClpX Zn(II) were independent of the presence or absence of exogenous Zn(II) or substitution of ATP by ADP in the running buffer (results not shown). It turns out that in the absence of ATP or ADP the Stokes radius of ClpX Zn(II) (Fig. 6 A) is very close to that of the ClpP 14-mer (Fig. 6 B), suggesting that ClpXs apparent molecular mass is close to 300 kDa. Therefore, at least a portion of the ClpX Zn(II) protein presumably exists in an hexameric form (6 × 46 kDa). A similar oligomeric form has been reported for the ClpY ATPase (15Kessel M. Wu W.

In excitable tissues, these channels play an essential role in establishing the resting membrane potential and in modulating the frequency and the duration of the action potential (1Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes.Sinauer Associates, Inc. 1991; Google Scholar). In nonexcitable cells, they are involved in cell volume regulation, hormone secretion, oxygen sensing, and cell proliferation (2Kolb H.A. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol... 1990; 115: 51-91Google Scholar). The functional diversity of these channels is partly due to variations in their structure. The ion-conducting pore of these channels is formed by heterotetramers of different, but structurally related, α subunits (2Kolb H.A. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol... 1990; 115: 51-91Google Scholar, 3Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron.. 1996; 16: 843-852Google Scholar). Moreover, the cytoplasmic face of the Kvα proteins associates with auxiliary β-subunits (Kvβ), which do not participate in ion conductance but can regulate the activity of the channel (4Xu J. Li M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med... 1998; 8: 229-234Google Scholar, 5Pongs O. Leicher T. Berger M. Roeper J. Bahring R. Wray D. Giese K.P. Silva A.J. Storm J.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci... 1999; 868: 344-355Google Scholar).Several homologous genes encoding the Kvβ proteins have been described. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of the β-subunit proteins shows that these proteins have a variable N terminus and a highly conserved C-terminal domain. The β-subunits have been assigned to three classes: Kvβ1 to 3. In addition, several splice variants of Kvβ1, that is, Kvβ1.1, 1.2, and 1.3, have been reported (for review, see Refs. 4Xu J. Li M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med... 1998; 8: 229-234Google Scholar and 5Pongs O. Leicher T. Berger M. Roeper J. Bahring R. Wray D. Giese K.P. Silva A.J. Storm J.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci... 1999; 868: 344-355Google Scholar). Although some of the β-subunits enhance the inactivation of the Kvα currents (4Xu J. Li M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med... 1998; 8: 229-234Google Scholar, 5Pongs O. Leicher T. Berger M. Roeper J. Bahring R. Wray D. Giese K.P. Silva A.J. Storm J.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci... 1999; 868: 344-355Google Scholar), the physiological role of these proteins remains unclear. In heterologous systems, coexpression of Kvβ increases the surface expression of Kvα, indicating that the β subunits regulate the expression and/or the localization of the Kvα proteins. Moreover, Kvβ2, which is the most widely distributed of the β-subunits, does not affect inactivation even though it associates with Kvα, suggesting that the β-subunits may have other undetermined physiological functions.Structural analyses support the view that Kvβ proteins may have unique regulatory properties not displayed by accessory proteins of other ion channels. The primary amino acid sequence of the Kvβ proteins is not related to the auxiliary proteins of other voltage-sensitive channels but, unexpectedly, to the proteins of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR)1 superfamily (6McCormack T. McCormack K. Cell.. 1994; 79: 1133-1135Google Scholar, 7Chouinard S.W. Wilson G.F. Schlimgen A.K. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 6763-6767Google Scholar). Within this superfamily, the amino acid sequences of the Kvβ proteins are most closely related to alfatoxin reductase (AKR7) and morphine dehydrogenase and 2,5-diketogluconate reductase (AKR5). On the basis of this homology, the Kvβ proteins have been assigned to the AKR6 family (8Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J... 1997; 326: 625-636Google Scholar). The AKR proteins catalyze the reduction or the oxidation of a broad range of carbonyl substrates, including aldoses, steroids, prostaglandins, and aldehydes derived from lipid peroxidation (8Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J... 1997; 326: 625-636Google Scholar, 9Srivastava S. Harter T.M. Chandra A. Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. Petrash J.M. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 12909-12917Google Scholar, 10Srivastava S. Watowich S.J. Petrash J.M. Srivastava S.K. Bhatnagar A. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 42-54Google Scholar, 11Jez J.M. Flynn T.G. Penning T.M. Biochem. Pharmacol... 1997; 54: 639-647Google Scholar). The sequence homology between the β-subunits and the AKR proteins suggests that the Kvβ proteins are catalytically competent oxidoreductases that couple metabolic changes to membrane excitability.The crystal structure of Kvβ2 shows that the protein folds into β8/α8 or the triosephosphate isomerase barrel motif similar to other AKR proteins (12Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell.. 1999; 97: 943-952Google Scholar). A single molecule of NADP+ was found to co-crystallize with each monomer of the protein (12Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell.. 1999; 97: 943-952Google Scholar). The cofactor was bound to the C terminus of Kvβ2 by active site residues, some of which are conserved within the AKR superfamily. Nonetheless, no functional data are available on pyridine nucleotide binding to Kvβ. In the present study, we examined the coenzyme specificity and selectivity of the purified Kvβ2 and investigated the role of individual active site residues involved in binding pyridine nucleotides.RESULTSAs shown in Fig. 1, the purified wild-type (WT) Kvβ2, its N terminus deleted form (ΔNKvβ2), and the indicated site-directed mutants migrated as single bands on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. The molecular masses of these proteins were between 38 and 40 kDa. When examined by size exclusion chromatography, the ΔNKvβ2 eluted with a retention time of 9.8 min, which corresponds to a Strokes radius of a protein with a molecular mass of 153 kDa, indicating that under these conditions, the protein exists primarily as a homotetramer. No monomeric or dimeric forms of the protein were observed (Fig.1 B). The freshly purified ΔNKvβ2 showed a high absorbance at 260 nm and an additional absorbance band centered near 360 nm (Fig. 2 A,inset), indicating that the purified protein remains bound to NAD(P)H. From the absorbance at 363 nm, a stoichiometry of ∼0.9 mol of NADPH bound/mol of the protein was calculated. To confirm that the purified preparation was indeed a binary complex, the fluorescence spectrum of the nucleotide-bound protein was recorded. When excited at 290 nm, the freshly isolated protein showed two prominent emission bands with peaks at 335 and 450 nm (Fig. 2 B). Upon extensive dialysis against 0.15 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, the intensity of the 335-nm band increased with a corresponding decrease in the emission band at 450 nm. When 1 μm NADPH was added to the dialyzed protein, the 450-nm band reappeared, whereas the emission at 335 nm was quenched (data not shown). The emission band at 450 nm was not restored by the addition of NADP+, although this did quench the emission at 335 nm. We conclude, based on these observations, that NADPH remains bound to the freshly purified ΔNKvβ2 and that it is lost from the protein upon dialysis. These data also show that the formation of a binary complex between NADPH and ΔNKvβ2 quenches the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the protein and leads to the appearance of a new emission band at 450 nm. However, for all subsequent experiments, we monitored the emission at 335 nm because, in contrast to the alterations at 450 nm, changes at 335 nm were independent of the redox state of the nucleotide.Figure 2Retention of NADPH in purified Kvβ2. Freshly prepared ΔNKvβ2 (∼1 mg/ml) was suspended in 0.15 mpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and scanned for absorbance and fluorescence. A, absorbance scan of ΔNKvβ2. The inset shows the absorbance of the protein between 310 and 400 nm. B, emission scan of ΔNKvβ2 in phosphate buffer before (−) and after (−) dialysis against phosphate buffer for 2 weeks. Identical protein concentrations were used for the two emission scans.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The titration of the extensively dialyzed Kvβ2 with NADPH led to a progressive loss of fluorescence at 335 nm (Fig.3). The change in fluorescence was saturated at high nucleotide concentration, and the addition of more than 0.6 μm NADPH caused no further decrease in fluorescence. Typically, NADPH quenched a maximum of ∼30–40% of the total fluorescence. Because the protein concentration was an independent variable in the fitting routine, at protein concentration >K d, we estimate that 60–70% of the total protein was bound to NADPH. The K dNADPH of the full-length Kvβ2 was 0.08 ± 0.004 μmand that of ΔNKvβ was 0.10 ± 0.006 μm. These results suggest that Kvβ2 has a high affinity for NADPH that is not affected by the deletion of the N-terminal domain. Thus for all subsequent experiments, the ΔNKvβ2 protein was used.Figure 3Binding of pyridine coenzymes to Kvβ2. Dialyzed ΔNKvβ2 was suspended in 0.15 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and changes in emission were monitored either at 335 nm (for NADPH) or 345 nm (for NADH) using 290 nm as the excitation wavelength. The protein was titrated with the indicated concentrations of NADPH (A) or NADH (B). The concentration of the protein was adjusted to be below the K d. Data are shown as discrete points, and the curves are the best fits to the data estimated as described in the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In addition to NADPH, ΔNKvβ2 also displayed a high affinity for NADP+, althoughK dNADP+ was 3-fold higher thanK dNADPH (TableI). The nucleotides, NADH, and NAD+ were also bound to the protein. However, the large intrinsic absorbance of these nucleotides at the high concentrations required for the assay precluded the accurate determination of theK dNAD(H) under conditions identical to those used for measuring K dNADP(H). Hence, to optimize emission and to minimize inner filter effects, a 5 × 10-mm cuvette was used for the assay, and instead of 335 nm, the emission of the protein was measured at 345 nm. Under these conditions the absorbance of 0.1 mm NAD(H) was less than 0.05 (see “Experimental Procedures”). TheK dNAD(H) values thus determined were in the low micromolar range (Table I).Table IThe binding of pyridine nucleotide coenzymes and analogs to Kvβ2LigandK dμmNADPH0.12 ± 0.004NADP+0.36 ± 0.014NADH1.23 ± 0.16NAD+3.61 ± 0.43′-Acetylpyridine NADP+4.24 ± 1.153′-Aminopyridine NADP+14.35 ± 1.34ADP-ribose412.01 ± 23.5FAD10.2 ± 5.99NMN144 ± 15.3NicotinamideN.D.Recombinant ΔNKvβ2 protein was suspended in 2 ml of 0.15m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and changes in emission at 335 or 345 nm were monitored using an excitation wavelength of 290 nm. The concentration of the protein used was less than theK d. Aliquots of the indicated ligands were added to the cuvette, and steady-state fluorescence was recorded. TheK d values were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are shown as the mean ± S.D. (n = 3–7). FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide; N.D., no detectable change in fluorescence observed after the addition of 100 μm ligand. Open table in a new tab We next determined the interaction of Kvβ2 with different nucleotide analogs. The K d of the protein for 3′-acetylpyridine NADP+ was 10-fold greater as compared with NADP+, indicating that the amide side chain of the nicotine ring participates in high affinity binding of NADP+ to the protein. The removal of the 3′-carbonyl from the nicotine ring also led to a decrease in affinity (compare theK d values for 3-aminopyridine NADP+ and NADP+), suggesting that there are energetically significant interactions between the 3′ side chain of the pyridine ring and the binding site residues. Other fragments of the pyridine coenzymes such as ADP-ribose, NMN, and nicotinamide displayed poor affinity for ΔNKvβ2. Moreover, the flavin coenzyme, FAD, bound weakly to the protein, indicating that it is unlikely to be an in vivo ligand of Kvβ2 or to compete with pyridine coenzymes for binding to the active site of the protein.The crystal structure of the ΔNKvβ·NADP+binary complex shows that the coenzyme binds into a deep cleft in the triosephosphate isomerase scaffolding of the protein (12Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell.. 1999; 97: 943-952Google Scholar). When bound, the cofactor displays an extended conformation and makes several contacts with the binding site residues. A schematic representation of these interactions is shown in Fig. 4. The sequence alignment of the Kvβ proteins, using the program CLUSTLW (17Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res... 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar), revealed that most of the residues interacting with the cofactor in Kvβ2 are conserved in other Kvβ proteins (Fig. 5). The orientation of the nicotinamide ring in Kvβ2 is constrained by H bonding with a basic residue (Arg-189) and π-stacking against an aromatic residue (Trp-243). To examine the significance of these interactions, site-directed mutants of ΔNKvβ2 were prepared in which Arg-189 was replaced by methionine, and Trp-243 was replaced by phenylalanine. As shown in Table II, no significant changes in theK dNADPH were observed with these mutations as compared with the WT protein. To confirm that the lack of change in the K dNADPH was not due to the retention of hydrophobicity in the tryptophan to phenylalanine substitution, Trp-243 was replaced with alanine. However, theK dNADPH of W243A was comparable with that of W243Y or the WT protein, indicating that ring stacking or the hydrophobicity of the residue at position 243 does not contribute to NADPH binding. In contrast, the disruption of the hydrogen bond between Asn-333 and the adenine ring in the N333W mutant completely prevented NADPH binding to the protein. Similarly, the replacement of an arginine replacement of glutamine 214, which interacts with the hydrogens attached to N7N of the nicotinamide ring, led to a 20-fold increase in K dNADPH. This observation indicates that the amide side chain of the pyridine ring plays a significant role in nucleotide recognition at the Kvβ2 binding site.Figure 4Schematic diagram of the interactions between NADPH and Kvβ2. The schematic is based on the crystal structure of the Kvβ2·NADP binary complex solved by Gulbis et al. (12Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell.. 1999; 97: 943-952Google Scholar).

N.D., no detectable change in fluorescence after the addition of 1 mm NADPH. Open table in a new tab In the ΔNKvβ2·NADP binary complex the oxygen attached to the ribose phosphate (OP1R) interacts with Tyr-255 via a water molecule (12Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell.. 1999; 97: 943-952Google Scholar), suggesting that this residue may be involved in coenzyme binding. The replacement of Tyr-255 with phenylalanine, however, did affect K dNADPH (Table II), indicating that this residue does not contribute to pyridine nucleotide binding. In addition to Tyr-255, the water molecule associated with OP1R forms a hydrogen bond with Cys-248 (12Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell.. 1999; 97: 943-952Google Scholar). This cysteine residue also interacts with the pyrophosphate oxygen (OP2A1) in a mode reminiscent of the lysine residue (Lys-262) that is responsible for the tight binding of NADPH to aldose reductase (AR; Ref. 18Bohren K.M. Page J.L. Shankar R. Henry S.P. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 24031-24037Google Scholar). The replacement of Cys-248 by serine, however, increased the affinity of ΔNKvβ2 for NADPH, as evinced by a decrease in K dNADPH from 100 to 20 nm (Table II).The coenzyme selectivity of the AKR proteins is in part due to the presence of basic amino acids in their binding pockets that accommodates the 2′-phosphate of NADPH (8Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J... 1997; 326: 625-636Google Scholar, 19Kubiseski T.J. Green N.C. Borhani D.W. Flynn T.G. J. Biol.

The 2′-phosphate binding pocket of Kvβ2 contains only one basic residue, that is, Arg-264. This residue forms a hydrogen bond with the free hydroxyl group of the adenine ribose and interacts with OP4R of the 2′-phosphate (Fig. 4). In our experiments, the replacement of Arg-264 with glutamic acid led to a complete loss of NADPH binding. The fluorescence of R264E was not quenched even by the addition of 1 mm of NADPH. These observations suggest that Arg-264 is essential for NADPH binding to Kvβ2.To confirm the results obtained from fluorometric titrations, the complete fluorescence spectra of the site-directed mutants were recorded. As expected, the freshly purified N333G and R264E proteins displayed a much stronger emission band at 335 nm than did equimolar concentrations of the WT or the C248S protein. Both the WT and C248S proteins displayed an additional band at 450 nm, which was absent in the emission spectra of the N333W and the R264E proteins (Fig.6), indicating that the N333W and R264E proteins do not bind NADPH. When excited at 340 nm (to elicit NADPH fluorescence), both the WT and the C248S proteins displayed strong emission near 450 nm, whereas the N333W and the R264E proteins did not; confirming that the N333W and R264E proteins do not contain NADPH bound to their active sites. To examine whether the lack of NADPH binding affects the quaternary structure of the protein, we determined the Strokes radius of R264E using size exclusion chromatography. The R264E protein eluted from the HPLC column with a retention time of 9.7 min (data not shown), which was similar to the retention time of the WT protein, indicating that binding of NADPH is not essential for the formation of the ΔNKvβ2 homotetramers.Figure 6The fluorescence spectra of the WT , C248S, R264E, and N333G ΔNKvβ2. The indicated proteins were purified and suspended in 0.15 mpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4. Aliquots of equal concentrations of the proteins were excited at either 290 (A) or 340 nm (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further characterize coenzyme binding to Kvβ2, we examined the effects of ionic strength and pH. As shown in Fig.7 A, an increase in the ionic strength of the buffer led to a decrease inK dNADPH. This dependence was best described by a Boltzmann function (Equation 5), in which the maximal value of the K dNADPH(Y max) was calculated to be 2.9 ± 0.3 μm, with a K 1/2 of 0.59 ± 0.04 m and a slope factor C of 0.15 ± 0.03 × 10-6. The effect of ionic strength on theK dNADPH of R189M was similar to that observed with the WT protein. However, the ionic strength dependence was significantly altered by the C248S mutation. Compared with the WT protein, C248S was less sensitive to changes in ionic strength. The best fit of Equation 5 to the data provided the following estimates of the parameters: Y max = 1.6 ± 0.4 μm, K 1/2 = 0.79 ± 0.15m, and C = 0.22 ± 0.05 × 10-6. These results support the idea that NADPH binding to Kvβ2 is sensitive to changes in ionic strength within the physiological range and that this sensitivity is in part due to Cys-248.Figure 7pH and ionic strength dependence of NADPH binding to Kvβ2. A, The K dNADPH of the WT (▪), R189M (●), and C248S (○) ΔNKvβ2 was determined in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 at the indicated ionic strength adjusted with KCl. For clarity, the inset shows a semi-logarithmic plot of the ionic strength dependence of NADPH binding to the WT protein. B, the pH-dependence ofK dNADPH of WT (○) and C248S (●) Kvβ2. Buffers of different pH were prepared using MES, MOPS, and Tris at a constant ionic strength of 0.2 m. The data are shown as mean ± S.D. (n = 3), and the curves are drawn from the best fits of the data (R 2 = 0.96–0.99) to Equation 4 for pH dependence and Equation 5 for ionic strength dependence of nucleotide binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The binding of NADPH to Kvβ2 was also found to be sensitive to pH. A systematic evaluation of the effects of pH revealed that the values of K dNADPH were enhanced at low pH but decreased at high pH. A plot of log (1/K d) reached a plateau at low pH, giving rise to a wave-like pH dependence (Fig. 7 B). Using Equation 4, a pKa of 6.9 ± 0.4 was calculated. At high pH, a slight decrease in K d was observed, but even at pH 10, log 1/K d did not decrease to half its maximal value, thereby precluding accurate estimates of pK b. An approximate calculation using Equation 3indicated that the pK b is near 9.6. This ionization may be due to Arg-264, but the role of this residue could not be tested further because the R264E mutant did not bind NADPH. However, our data show that the pK a value depends in part on Cys-248 because the C248S mutation shifted the pK a value from 6.9 to 7.4 ± 0.2 (Fig. 7 B).DISCUSSIONThe results of this study show that the β-subunit of the Kv channel preferentially binds NADPH, suggesting that NADPH may be the most probable ligand bound to Kvβin vivo. Our data further show that NADPH binds to the C terminus or the conserved AKR core of the protein and that this binding is not affected by the variable N terminus of the protein. The high affinity with which Kvβ2 binds NADPH is comparable with the affinity of other AKR proteins for this cofactor (21Jez J.M. Schlegel B.P. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 30190-30198Google Scholar, 22Kubiseski T.J. Hyndman D.J. Morjana N.A. Flynn T.G. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 6510-6517Google Scholar). Upon binding NADPH, the intrinsic fluorescence of Kvβ2 was quenched, and an additional emission band appeared that centered around 450 nm. These changes are similar to those observed upon NAPDH binding to other AKR proteins, such as 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD; Ref. 21Jez J.M. Schlegel B.P. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 30190-30198Google Scholar) and AR (22Kubiseski T.J. Hyndman D.J. Morjana N.A. Flynn T.G. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 6510-6517Google Scholar). The 450-nm emission of the 3α-HSD·NADPH complex has been suggested to be due to the formation of a charge-transfer complex between the reduced nicotinamide ring and Trp-87 located within 10 Å of the ring (21Jez J.M. Schlegel B.P. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 30190-30198Google Scholar). The Trp-87 of 3α-HSD is located in the β3 sheet of the triosephosphate isomerase barrel and is conserved in AR (Trp-79), Kvβ (Trp-121), and other AKR proteins (8Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J... 1997; 326: 625-636Google Scholar), indicating that similar interactions are likely in most AKRs. Hence, the formation of a low energy charge-transfer complex in the Kvβ2·NADPH complex suggests that the functional characteristics of pyridine coenzyme binding as well as the solution conformation of the AKR active site are conserved in Kvβ2.The crystal structure the Kvβ2·NADP complex shows that the coenzyme forms multiple contacts with the protein (12Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell.. 1999; 97: 943-952Google Scholar). The two ends of the coenzyme molecule, the nicotinamide and the adenine rings, interact with residues that are similar to those observed in AR, 3α-HSD, and 2,5-DKGR (23Wilson D.K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Quiocho F.A. Science.. 1992; 257: 81-84Google Scholar, 24Hoog S.S. Pawlowski J.E. Alzari P.M. Penning T.M. Lewis M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 2517-2521Google Scholar, 25Khurana S. Powers D.B. Anderson S. Blaber M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 6768-6773Google Scholar). The binding of the nicotinamide ring by 3α-HSD is defined by the interactions between Asn-167 and O7N, Ser-166 and N7N, and Gln-190 and N7N of NADP+ (24Hoog S.S. Pawlowski J.E. Alzari P.M. Penning T.M. Lewis M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 2517-2521Google Scholar). The corresponding residues in AR are Asn-160, Ser-159, and Gln-183 (23Wilson D.K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Quiocho F.A. Science.. 1992; 257: 81-84Google Scholar). Although in Kvβ2 the serine residue (at position 188) and the glutamine residue (at position 214) are conserved, the O7N of NADP+ interacts with Arg-189 (12Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell.. 1999; 97: 943-952Google Scholar). However, the interaction between O7N and Arg-189 in Kvβ2 does not seem to contribute to the stabilization of the nicotinamide ring at the binding site, because R189M mutation did not affectK dNADPH. Thus, the recognition of the nicotinamide ring appears primarily to be due to the interactions between the Ser-188 and Gln-214 of Kvβ2 and the amino group of the nicotinamide ring. This view is supported by the observation that the K d values of Kvβ2 for 3′-acetyl pyridine NADP+ and 3′-amino pyridine NADP+ were 10–30-fold higher than that for NADP+ (Table I). Nicotinamide by itself did not bind to the protein, although ADP-ribose and NMN displayed high, but measurable,K d values, suggesting that the coupling of the adenine and the nicotinamide rings to ribose enhances the binding of the cofactor to the protein.The major difference in NADPH binding by the AKR proteins is their"
https://openalex.org/W2160208722,"Regulation of the stability of p53 is key to its tumor-suppressing activities. mdm2 directly binds to the amino-terminal region of p53 and targets it for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The coactivator protein TAFII31 binds to p53 at the amino-terminal region that is also required for interaction with mdm2. In this report, we demonstrate that expression of TAFII31 inhibits mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 and increases p53 levels. TAFII31-mediated p53 stabilization results in activation of p53-mediated transcriptional activity and leads to p53-dependent growth arrest in fibroblasts. UV-induced stabilization of p53 coincides with an increase in p53-associated TAFII31 and a corresponding decrease in mdm2-p53 interaction. Non-p53 binding mutant of TAFII31 fails to stabilize p53. Our results suggest that direct interaction of TAFII31 and p53 not only mediates p53 transcriptional activation but also protects p53 from mdm2-mediated degradation, thereby resulting in activation of p53 functions.

Mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is frequently associated with different forms of human cancers. The ability of p53 protein to suppress tumor growth is attributed by two major biological processes induced by p53: cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs.1Oren M. Rotter V. Cell Mol.

Whereas mdm2, JNK, and E6 have been implicated in targeting p53 for degradation, WT1, E1B 55K, and SV40T antigen stabilize p53 leading to increases in p53 levels. mdm2 functions as a pivotal p53 regulator and inhibits p53 functions by dual mechanisms. Interaction of mdm2 with p53 at its transactivation domain directly inhibits p53-mediated transcriptional activity (17Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar, 18Oliner J.D. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Gyuris J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1993; 362: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). Binding of mdm2 to p53 also targets p53 for degradation through ubiquitin-mediated pathways (19Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Wu X. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 20Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). As one of p53 targets, expression of mdm2 is transcriptionally regulated by p53 (21Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar), resulting in a feedback loop that regulates the level and activity of p53 (21Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar). The biological implication of this regulatory loop is evident in that amplification ofmdm2 gene has been found in about 30% of human soft tissue sarcomas and in other human cancers (22Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar, 23Cordon-Cardo C. Latres E. Drobnjak M. Oliva M.R. Pollack D. Woodruff J.M. Marechal V. Chen J. Brennan M.F. Levine A.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 794-799PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that negative regulation of p53 by mdm2 is important in the development of those tumors. Loss of mdm2, on the other hand, results in an up-regulation of p53 activity and subsequent abrogation in cell cycle control and lethality in mice (24Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 25Montes de Oca L. una R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). As a transcription factor, the p53 protein activates transcription of target genes by binding RNA polymerase II complex. Two of the TATA-binding polypeptide (TBP)-associated factors (TAFs) 1The abbreviations used are: TBPTATA-binding polypeptideTAFTATA-binding polypeptide-associated factorHAhemagglutininATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)PBSphosphate-buffered salineGFPgreen fluorescent protein within the general transcription factor TFIID complex, TAFII31 and TAFII70, have been shown to interact with the amino-terminal activation domain of p53 directly in vitro(26Thut C.J.

A. 1995; 92: 5154-5158Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that TBP mediates only basal transcription, whereas the TAF-TBP complex (TFIID) can mediate specific transcription factor-directed transactivation (28Berk A.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although thein vivo requirement for TAFs in p53-mediated transcription activation remains unclear, the fact that TAFII31 and TAFII70 support p53-mediated transcriptional activation in reconstituted transcription reactions suggests a critical role for TAFs in p53-mediated transactivation in vivo. TATA-binding polypeptide TATA-binding polypeptide-associated factor hemagglutinin adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) phosphate-buffered saline green fluorescent protein The observation that both TAFII31 and mdm2 bind to the same amino-terminal region of p53 suggests that TAFII31 may play an important role in regulating p53 protein stability and functions. To test this hypothesis, we have measured the effect of TAFII31 on ubiquitination and stability of p53 bothin vivo and in vitro using either purified protein components or whole cell extracts (11Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu X. Jones S.N. Ronai Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Our results showed that TAFII31 enhances p53 stability by inhibiting mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Expression of TAFII31 also induces p53- dependent transcriptional activation and cell cycle inhibition, suggesting that TAFII31 plays an active role in regulating p53 stability and activity in cells. All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 incubators at 37 °C. The human TAFII31 expression vector was constructed by cloning human TAFII31 cDNA into the pMTN expression vector under the control of SV40 promoter. The HA tag was engineered at the amino terminus. Mutant TAFII31 was generated by polymerase chain reaction and constructed into pMTN with HA tag. The mdm2 and p53 expression plasmids have been described elsewhere (11Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu X. Jones S.N. Ronai Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The p53 reporter plasmids were described previously (29Resnick-Silverman L. St Clair S. Maurer M. Zhao K. Manfredi J.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2102-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out using Fugene orN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium methyl sulfate transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In transient transfection experiments, cells were harvested 48–72 h after transfection. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 350 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin) by sonication on ice. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentrations were determined, and aliquots were stored at −80 °C. For immunoprecipitation, equal amount of lysates were immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody against p53, pAb421, and protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 16–24 h. The complex was washed three times with lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The proteins were transferred to a Hybond-C membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), blotted by a rabbit polyclonal antibody against p53 (Santa Cruz), and developed using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Endogenous TAFII31 was detected using a monoclonal antibody against TAFII31. mdm2 was detected by monoclonal antibody 2A10. For Northern analysis, equal quantities of total RNA isolated by RNAzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 10–20 μg/sample were subjected to electrophoresis on a denaturing 1% formaldehyde agarose gel. The RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled probes using the Rapid Hybridization System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 10.1 cells growing in 10-cm plates were transfected with p53, mdm2, and TAFII31. A protein labeling mixture containing [35S]methionine (50 μCi; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the plates 48 h after transfection and incubated for 10 min. The label was removed, and fresh media were added. The cells were harvested at 0, 1, and 2 h. The p53 protein was detected as described (11Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu X. Jones S.N. Ronai Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Baculovirus-expressed mdm2 and histidine-tagged p53 proteins were obtained as described (19Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Wu X. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The TAFII31 protein was produced by in vitro transcription and translation (Promega). Ubiquitination was performed using reticulocyte lysates depleted of mdm2 and JNK that provide the necessary components. The mdm2 and/or TAFII31 (in 1-ng quantities) were incubated on ice with bacterially expressed p53 (1–5 μg) bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads for 45 min. After extensive washes (four times with 1 ml of kinase buffer), the substrate-bound beads were equilibrated with 1× ubiquitination buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm NaF, and 3 mm okadaic acid) and incubated in the same buffer supplemented with 2 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 0.02 unit creatine phosphokinase, 2 μg of Ub HA, 1.5 mm ATPγS (Sigma), and 33% RL (v/v) in a total volume of 30 μl at 30 °C for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 8 m urea in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) with 0.1% of Nonidet P-40. The beads were washed three times with the stop buffer and once with PBS supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100, and the protein moiety was eluted with Laemmli sample buffer at 100 °C and subjected to Western blotting as described (11Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu X. Jones S.N. Ronai Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). For the in vivo ubiquitination assay, the cells were transfected with his-p53 (1 μg), mdm2 (3 μg), TAFII31 (3 μg), and HA-ubiquitin (1 μg). The cells were treated with MG132 (10 μm, CalBiochem) for 12 h at 48 h after transfection and lysed in kinase buffer. The p53-ubiquitin complex was precipitated by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads and analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (19Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Wu X. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Saos-2 cells were transfected using the N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy) propyl]-N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium methyl sulphate liposomal transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as follows. 100,000 cells were plated in each well of 6-well dishes and incubated overnight. Cells were fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and incubated for an additional 3 h. N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy) propyl]-N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium methyl sulphate/DNA mixtures containing appropriate amounts of reporter constructs and expression plasmids were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Serum-free medium was then added to the mixtures and used to replace the medium in the wells. The dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h, after which the transfection mix was removed and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. After 48 h, the 6-well plates were placed on ice and washed once with PBS. The cells were then lysed by scraping into 120 μl of reporter buffer (Promega Luciferase Assay System), and samples were spun for 1 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. The total protein concentration was determined using a commercially available assay (Bio-Rad). Of each sample, 40 μl were warmed to room temperature and mixed with luciferase assay substrate reconstituted with Luciferase Assay Buffer (Promega). Light emission was determined in a TD-20e luminometer (Turner). 10.1 and 12.1 cells were plated in 60 cm plates. The cells were transfected with 2 μg of neo vector (pCMV-BM), p53, TAFII31, and 5 μg of salmon sperm DNA as carrier using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure. Transfected cells were selected by Geneticin (50 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2–3 weeks. The colony was stained with Giemsa stain (Sigma). The flow cytometry were performed as described (30Relaix F. Wei X. Li W. Pan J. Lin Y. Bowtell D.D. Sassoon D.A. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with 2 μg of green fluorescence protein expression plasmid pEGFP-N (CLONTECH) and 10.0 μg of either control DNA (empty vector), or p53, or TAFII31 expressing plasmid. Transfected cells were harvested 48–72 h later and washed twice in PBS. The cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized in 70% ethanol for 16 h at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in PBS containing 5 μg of propidium iodide and RNase A (5 μg/ml). Flow cytometric analysis was carried out in a fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyzer (Coulter). GFP positive cells were gated and analyzed for DNA content. As a first step to address the possible role of TAFs in regulating p53 stability, mammalian expression vectors encoding human TAFII31 and p53 were transfected into 10.1 mouse Balb/c 3T3 fibroblast cells that lack endogenous p53 (31Harvey D.M. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2375-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of mdm2 and p53 decreased expression levels of p53 as a result of its destabilization, as previously reported (15Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3719) Google Scholar, 16Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). Expression of TAFII31 in 10.1 cells increased the levels of p53 protein by 2-fold (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, forced expression of TAFII31 attenuated mdm2-mediated on p53 degradation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). TAFII31 did not change mRNA levels of p53 (Fig.1 A), suggesting that the elevation of p53 levels by TAFII31 was not due to increased transcription of the p53 gene. In a duplicate experiment, expression levels of TAFII31 protein in the transfection experiment were confirmed by Western analysis (Fig. 1 A). Pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine revealed that the half-life of p53 was extended in cells expressing TAFII31 (Fig.1 B), supporting the notion that induction of p53 levels by TAFII31 is due to enhanced p53 stability. To determine whether TAFII31 mediates its effect on p53 through mdm2 or through an independent mechanism, p53 and TAFII31 were cotransfected into a p53/mdm2 double null cell line. The results demonstrated that p53 levels are not affected by the expression of TAFII31 in p53/mdm2 null cells, indicating that stabilization of p53 by TAFII31 is mdm2 dependent (Fig. 1 C). Because binding of p53 by mdm2 is required for mdm2-mediated p53 degradation (15Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3719) Google Scholar, 16Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar), these results suggest that TAFII31 either out-competes mdm2 for binding to p53 or excludes mdm2 from the p53 complex, thus preventing mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. It has been shown that mdm2 targets p53 for ubiquitination, and we demonstrated that TAFII31 inhibits mdm2-mediated degradation of p53. To extend our finding that the effect of TAFII31 on p53 is at the level of ubiquitination, an in vitro ubiquitination assay was used to determine the degree of p53 ubiquitination after expression of TAFII31 (19Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Wu X. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In this assay nickel bead-bound histidine-tagged p53 (his-p53) was incubated with TAFII31 and the targeting protein mdm2. Subsequently, the ubiquitination reaction was carried out using reticulocyte lysates depleted of mdm2 and JNK (Fig.2 A). The addition of mdm2 to p53 in the in vitro ubiquitination reaction resulted in ubiquitinated p53. Although TAFII31 alone did not appear to affect p53 ubiquitination, it inhibited mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). These findings suggest that TAFII31 increases p53 stability by inhibiting mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. To determine the effect of TAFII31 on p53 ubiquitination in vivo, mdm2, TAFII31, and his-p53 expression plasmids were cotransfected into Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts in various combinations together with the HA-tagged ubiquitin expression vector. After treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132, the transfected p53 was purified on nickel beads and detected by immunoblotting with pAb421 antibody to p53. The degree of polyubiquitinated p53 was detected using antibody against HA. Consistent with the in vitro data, expression of mdm2 increased p53 ubiquitination and coexpression of TAFII31 blocked mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 in vivo(Fig. 2 B). These data indicate that TAFII31 attenuates the effect of mdm2 on p53 ubiquitination. To test whether TAFII31-p53 interaction is required for the ability of TAFII31 to stabilize p53, we generated mutant TAFII31 truncated at either the amino or carboxyl terminus. The TAF-C expresses amino acids 130–264 of TAFII31 and TAF-N produces amino acids 1–141 of the protein (Fig. 3 A). Co-transfecting mutant TAFII31 with p53 in mammalian cells showed that TAF-C coimmunoprecipitated with p53, and no interaction was detectable between TAF-N and p53 in the same assay (Fig.3 B). To explore the effect of TAFII31 mutants on p53 levels and stability, we first examined the ability of these mutants to inhibit mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. Expression of mdm2 resulted in p53 degradation (Figs. 1 A and 3C). Co-transfection of TAF-C significantly attenuated the ability of mdm2 to degrade p53 (Fig. 3 C), although it is not as effective as the full-length protein (Fig. 3 C). On the other hand, coexpression of TAF-N has no substantial effect on p53 levels (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that TAFII31-p53 interaction is required for the inhibitory function TAFII31 inhibitory function on mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. To further confirm this observation, we investigated the effect of mutant TAFII31 on mdm2-induced p53 ubiquitination (Fig.3 D). Consistent with p53 stability data (Fig.3 C), expression of TAF-C, but not TAF-N, resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. Similarly, the anti-ubiquitination activity of TAF-C appears to be weaker than its full-length counterpart (Fig.3 D), suggesting that other mechanisms are also involved in stabilizing p53 by TAFII31 besides direct competition with mdm2 binding. Stabilization of p53 in cells is expected to result in activation of p53 downstream pathways, including activation of p53-mediated transcription activity, inhibition of cell cycle progression, and/or activation of p53-mediated apoptosis. To elucidate the biological implications of p53 stabilization mediated by TAFII31, we first analyzed p53 transcriptional activity using a luciferase reporter containing p53 binding sites from the human p21/WAF-1 gene (29Resnick-Silverman L. St Clair S. Maurer M. Zhao K. Manfredi J.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2102-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Transfection of TAFII31 did not alter the basal transcriptional activity of the reporter containing p53 binding site (Fig. 4 A), whereas cotransfection of p53 and TAFII31 super-activated the reporter activities in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 A). The synergetic activation of the p53 reporter gene by TAFII31 may be attributed to its dual effects on p53 stability and its function as a p53 coactivator. The effect of TAFII31 mutants on p53-mediated transcription activation was also tested in similar assays. In contrast to the wild type protein, both mutants inhibited p53-activated transcription (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, these mutants inhibit wild type TAFII31-mediated p53 transcription activation (Fig.4 B). Because TAFII31 functions as a bridge to link p53 to the transcriptional machinery (26Thut C.J. Chen J.L. Klemm R. Tjian R. Science. 1995; 267: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 27Lu H. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5154-5158Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), our data suggest that expression of TAF mutants disrupts the formation of p53 transcription complex and thus blocks p53-mediated transcriptional activity. To further explore the consequences of activation of p53-mediated transcription by TAFII31, we used colony formation assay to monitor whether expression of TAFII31 could affect cell growth (Fig.4 C and Table I). Transfection of p53 into either 12.1 cells (p53 wild type) or 10.1 cells (p53-null) resulted in a 8-fold reduction in plating efficiency, as a result of p53-mediated growth arrest in both cell types. Transfection of TAFII31 into 12.1 cells resulted in a 7-fold decrease in colony formation. This effect was not seen in 10.1 cells. These data suggest that the ability of TAFII31 to reduce the number of colonies formed is mediated by p53. fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of cell transiently transfected with TAFII31 further confirmed this finding. Expression of TAFII31 causes accumulation of cells in G1 and reduction of cells in S phase of the cell cycle in a p53-dependent manner (Fig. 4 D). These results demonstrate that expression of TAFII31 leads to activation of p53-mediated growth arrest.Table Ip53-dependent suppression of cell plating efficiency by TAFII31Transfected DNANo. of colonies/105 cells plated12.1 cells (p53 wild type)10.1 cells (p53-null)Expt 1Expt 2Expt 3MeanExpt 1Expt 2Expt 3Meanneo vector411029377321047470neo vector + p533121293111710neo vector + TAFII31615141228725752Each transfection mixture contained 2 μg of neo vector, p53, TAFII31, and 5 μg of salmon sperm DNA as carrier.

The geneticin-resistant colonies were counted 2–3 weeks after transfection. Expt, experiment. Because forced expression of TAFII31 leads to stabilization of p53 and subsequent growth suppression, the association of p53 and TAFII31 in cells was then explored. Analysis of the p53-TAFII31 complex was carried out in Swiss3T3 cells before and after DNA damage (UV irradiation). Immunoprecipitation using monoclonal antibodies against p53 and immunoblot with antibodies to TAFII31 identified TAFII31 bound to p53 after UV exposure. The amount of TAFII31 protein associated with p53 was proportional to the levels of p53, whereas the levels of mdm2 associated with p53 were inversely correlated with those of TAFII31 (Fig.5). TAFII31 was in a complex with p53 in untreated cells, because TAFII31 was immunoprecipitated by anti-p53 antibody at time 0 where low levels of p53 is expressed. This band is specific, because it is not present in 10.1 cells which lack p53 (data not shown). The increasing TAFII31 associated with p53 after UV was not due to an increase in TAFII31 levels as a result of UV exposure, because the total TAFII31 protein did not change before and after UV treatment. These results suggest that TAFII31 contributes to the stabilization of p53 after DNA damage. We have demonstrated in this study that expression of the coactivator protein TAFII31 contributes to the regulation of p53 stability through mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination pathway. Stabilization of p53 by TAFII31 leads to functional activation of p53-mediated transcriptional activation and induction of cell cycle inhibition, suggesting that TAFII31 contributes positively to p53 functions in cells. Although most of the experiments in this study are performed in transient transfection assays which result in overexpression of proteins, the fact that there is a positive correlation between endogenous p53 stabilization and p53-TAFII31 association after DNA damage (Fig. 5) suggests that TAFII31 plays an important role in the regulation of p53 activity in vivo. This is consistent with the observation that expression of TAFII31 induces growth arrest mediated by endogenous p53 (Fig. 4, C andD, and Table I). The mdm2 protein regulates both the activity and levels of p53 through a negative feedback loop. The TAFII31-p53 interaction, on the other hand, seems to form a positive loop to activate p53 and its downstream pathways. It appears that TAFII31 can directly inhibit mdm2-p53 interaction and stabilize p53 as suggested in the in vitro ubiquitination assay (Fig. 2 A). It is further supported by the fact that p53-TAFII31 interaction is required for TAFII31-mediated p53 stabilization (Fig. 3). As a transcription coactivator, TAFII31 may recruit p53 to the transcription complex (26Thut C.J. Chen J.L. Klemm R. Tjian R. Science. 1995; 267: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 27Lu H. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5154-5158Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), which leads to transcriptional activation of p53 as seen in Fig. 4 A. The recruitment of p53 to the transcription complex by TAFII31 may also protect p53 from the mdm2-mediated degradation. These properties of TAFII31 reinforce its function as coactivator of p53. Although the mechanistic basis of regulation of p53 function by endogenous TAFII31 requires additional investigation, the finding that the effect of TAFII31 on p53 requires protein-protein interactions suggests that TAFII31 may directly compete with mdm2 for p53 binding, and a delicate balance between mdm2 and TAFII31 determines the levels and stability of p53. TAFII31 is part of the TFIID complex, containing TBP and many other TAFs. It has been shown that TAF-TAF interactions are highly conserved to allow interchange between homologues of TAFs from different species in transcription reactions in vitro (26Thut C.J. Chen J.L. Klemm R. Tjian R. Science. 1995; 267: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar,32Chen J.L. Attardi L.D. Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 79: 93-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of Drosophila dTAFII40 and human TAFII31 as well as dTAFII60 and TAFII70 showed that the amino-terminal region is highly conserved (data not shown), suggesting that this region may be used for TAF-TAF interactions. Consistent with this notion, it has been shown that the conserved amino-terminal domain of TAFII70 interacts with TBP, TAFII250, and TAFII31 (33Hisatake K. Ohta T. Takada R. Guermah M. Horikoshi M. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8195-8199Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The fact that the carboxyl half of TAFII31 contains the p53 binding domain further supports this possibility (Fig. 3). Thus, TAFII31 functions as a bridge between p53 and the general transcription machinery using its carboxyl terminus to interact with p53 while binding to TFIID using its amino-terminal domain. Although TAFII31 enhances p53-mediated transcription activation, the mutant TAFII31 lacking either amino or carboxyl terminus cannot form proper transcription complex and inhibits p53 transcription activity (Fig. 4). The dominant negative effects of TAFII31 mutants on p53 transactivation suggest that TAFII31 plays an important role in mediating p53 transcriptional activity in vivo. Recent studies showed that various TAF complexes (with or without TBP) mediate distinct functions, such as transcription activation (34Martinez E. Kundu T.K. Fu J. Roeder R.G. J. Biol.

The findings presented in this report that TAFII31 can stabilize p53 further expand the growing list of functions mediated by the coactivator proteins. It appears that the p53 stability is regulated by multiple factors in cells. Besides mdm2 and TAFII31, many other proteins have been shown to regulate p53 stability, such as WT-1 (7Maheswaran S. Englert C. Bennett P. Heinrich G. Haber D.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2143-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), JNK (11Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu X. Jones S.N. Ronai Z.

Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). How TAFII31 interacts with these proteins in stabilizing p53 is unknown. It is possible that the balance between these factors determines p53 levels. The emerging model suggests that the contributions of different factors to p53 stability may depend on cell context, cell cycle, and cell stressing signals. One example is the finding that JNK appears to regulate p53 ubiquitination in nonstressed cells at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, whereas mdm2 controls the stability of p53 at S and G2/M (11Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu X. Jones S.N. Ronai Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We thank Drs. Stuart Aaronson, David Sassoon, Z. Q. Pan, and J.

https://openalex.org/W2170443407,"TCF11 is a bZIP transcription factor of the CNC subfamily. It has been implicated in the regulation of the antioxidant response and is vital during embryonic development, but its precise biological functions have not yet been fully worked out. Structural characterization of the gene and several of its products indicates that complex regulatory mechanisms are employed. To investigate how altering the structure of the gene products might influence their activity we have mapped functional domains within the protein. We show that two separate domains are required for transactivation by full-length TCF11: an N-terminal acidic domain and a serine-rich stretch adjacent to the CNC-bZIP domains. A naturally occurring shorter isoform (identical to LCR-F1) produced by internal initiation of translation is unable to transactivate in our assay. However, the shorter form could interfere with the transactivating ability of the longer form, which indicates a control mechanism for keeping the activity of TCF11 at a desired level. We show that TCF11 and the closely related CNC-bZIP factor p45 NF-E2 show different cell type-specific activation patterns with full-length TCF11 being active in COS-1 cells but silent in erythroid cells (K562), whereas p45 NF-E2 is active in K562 cells and silent in COS-1 cells. Domain swapping experiments show that cell type-specific activity is not fully determined by dimerization/DNA binding domains or transactivation domains alone. The resulting profile of activity is most likely achieved by interaction of the domains and their cell-specific environment. TCF11 is a bZIP transcription factor of the CNC subfamily.

The importance of TCF11 was demonstrated by two independent inactivations of the gene in mouse, showing that TCF11 is vital during development (6Farmer S.C. Sun C.W. Winnier G.E. Hogan B.L. Townes T.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 7Chan J.Y. Kwong M. Lu R. Chang J. Wang B. Yen T.S. Kan Y.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), but the precise biological role of TCF11 has not yet been defined. It has been shown that fibroblasts derived from TCF11/Nrf1-null embryos have enhanced sensitivity to the toxic effects of oxidant compounds (8Kwong M. Kan Y.W. Chan J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37491-37498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This is likely to be because of reduced glutathione level in these cells. TCF11 binding and transactivation of the promoter of the catalytic subunit of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase have recently been observed. 1Myhrstad, M. C. W., Husberg, C., Murphy, P., Nordström, O., Blomhott, R., Moskaug, J. Ø., and Kolstø, A. B. (2001) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1517, 212–219. In addition, TCF11 has been shown to transactivate through the hARE response element in the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 promoter (9Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14960-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), a site that is important for the induction of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 in response to xenobiotics and antioxidants. These observations indicate a role for TCF11 in the regulation of the antioxidant response. In addition, TCF11 has also been suggested to play a role in tumor necrosis factor-α regulation, because specific interaction with the tumor necrosis factor-α promoter has been demonstrated in the cell line DC18 (10Prieschl E.E. Novotny V. Csonga R. Jaksche D. Elbe-Burger A. Thumb W. Auer M. Stingl G. Baumruker T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2291-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). TCF11 is widely expressed (1Luna L. Johnsen O. Skartlien A.H. Pedeutour F. Turc-Carel C. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Genomics. 1994; 22: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and has the potential of complex regulation. Among the different cDNA clones that were originally isolated, both alternative transcription start sites and alternative poly(A) sites were observed. Several different isoforms caused by alternative splicing were isolated (1Luna L. Johnsen O. Skartlien A.H. Pedeutour F. Turc-Carel C. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Genomics. 1994; 22: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), one of them identical to the cDNA sequence of Nrf1 (2Chan J.Y. Han X.L. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11371-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In a later study another isoform was identified without the serine-rich domain, which specifically interacts with the tumor necrosis factor-α promoter to stimulate transcription (10Prieschl E.E. Novotny V. Csonga R. Jaksche D. Elbe-Burger A. Thumb W. Auer M. Stingl G. Baumruker T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2291-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that differential processing of TCF11 transcripts is a prominent feature and may be important in regulating TCF11 activity. The activity of TCF11 may also be regulated at a number of additional levels. First, tcf11 transcripts are translated as two major isoforms with the possibility for translational initiation from an internal methionine cluster to yield a short isoform of 447 amino acids (originally described as LCR-F1 (11Caterina J.J. Donze D. Sun C.W. Ciavatta D.J. Townes T.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2383-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)). Full-length TCF11 ranges from 728 to 772 amino acids depending on alternative splicing within an acidic N-terminal domain (1Luna L. Johnsen O. Skartlien A.H. Pedeutour F. Turc-Carel C. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Genomics. 1994; 22: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Second, dimerization with different partners may alter the transactivating activity of TCF11. The small Maf proteins MafF, MafG, and MafK have been identified as putative partners of TCF11 (12Johnsen O. Skammelsrud N. Luna L. Nishizawa M. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4289-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Toki T. Itoh J. Kitazawa J. Arai K. Hatakeyama K. Akasaka J. Igarashi K. Nomura N. Yokoyama M. Yamamoto M. Ito E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). More recent results show that these factors, originally thought to be widely expressed, are differentially expressed during development and might therefore regulate TCF11 in a tissue-specific manner (14Murphy P. Kolsto A. Mech. Dev. 2000; 97: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Onodera K. Shavit J.A. Motohashi H. Katsuoka F. Akasaka J.E. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21162-21169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both MafG and MafK repress transactivation when coexpressed with TCF11 compared with the level of reporter gene transcription induced by TCF11 alone in transient transfections (13Toki T. Itoh J. Kitazawa J. Arai K. Hatakeyama K. Akasaka J. Igarashi K. Nomura N. Yokoyama M. Yamamoto M. Ito E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Johnsen O. Murphy P. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, these factors are also partners of several other bZIP proteins (for an overview, see Ref. 17Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2953-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), such as the erythroid-specific transcription factor p45 NF-E2 (13Toki T. Itoh J. Kitazawa J. Arai K. Hatakeyama K. Akasaka J. Igarashi K. Nomura N. Yokoyama M. Yamamoto M. Ito E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 18Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and more widely expressed family members. Competition between partners might thus regulate TCF11 activity. Third, post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may play a role in regulating of TCF11 activity. TCF11 has several potential phosphorylation sites, and casein kinase II has been shown to phosphorylate an isoform of TCF11 specifically and thereby render it active in binding to the tumor necrosis factor-α promoter (10Prieschl E.E. Novotny V. Csonga R. Jaksche D. Elbe-Burger A. Thumb W. Auer M. Stingl G. Baumruker T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2291-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fourth, TCF11 might interact with other tissue-specific, yet unidentified cofactors. Given the potential for complex regulation and interaction, we wished to map functional domains within TCF11, using a transactivation assay in cultured cells. The activities of three naturally occurring differential translation products have been compared, and we used deletion and fusion constructs to examine subdomains more extensively. Two different regions in the TCF11 protein are required to gain full transcription factor activity in transient transfections in COS-1 and HeLa cells. However, even full-length TCF11 is inactive in K562 cells, whereas the closely related protein p45 NF-E2 is active under the same conditions. We demonstrate that even though TCF11 and p45 NF-E2 have a high degree of similarity in their DNA binding domains, one does not interfere with the transactivation abilities of the other through the NF-E2 site when coexpressed in transient transfections. Chimeric fusions between TCF11 and p45 NF-E2 show that the DNA binding and dimerization domains from p45 NF-E2 can replace the corresponding domains from TCF11 and give a protein with the functional characteristics of TCF11. However, this occurs only when the fusion includes the serine-rich stretch, a domain that is not present in p45 NF-E2. The expression construct pcA20 producing TCF11 longer form was made by cloning the full-length sequence of tcf11, clone pZcEA20 (5′ to the EcoRV site at bp 3550, accession no. X77366) (1Luna L. Johnsen O. Skartlien A.H. Pedeutour F. Turc-Carel C. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Genomics. 1994; 22: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). In the same way, clone pZcEA56 was used to make an expression construct pcA56 producing a variant of the TCF11 longer form, and pZcEA52 was used for the construct pcA52 producing only the shorter form. An expression construct pcA20IntMut producing only the full-length TCF11 was made by mutating the four internal methionine residues (Met-318, Met-321, Met-323, and Met-326) to leucine residues (QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis, Stratagene). All deletion constructs were made from the full-length sequence of tcf11(pcA20). In the TCF11Δ173–315 construct (numbers referring to the amino acid residues deleted) the sequence between the twoBglII sites was deleted (restriction sites at bp 1108 and 1537 in the tcf11 sequence). In the TCF11Δ12–125 construct the sequence between the XmnI site (bp 624) and the first XhoI site (bp 962) was deleted. In the TCF11Δ12–315 construct the sequence between the XmnI (bp 624) site and the second BglII site (bp 1537) was deleted, and in the TCF11Δ469–558 construct the sequence between aPvuII site (bp 1996) and the NarI (bp 2569) site was deleted. The p45 NF-E2 expression construct was kindly provided by Dr. Paul Ney. In this construct the murine p45 NF-E2 is under the control of the polypeptide chain elongation factor 1α (19Bean T.L. Ney P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2509-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,20Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). For in vitro translation, p45 NF-E2 was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector using the EcoRI and theNotI sites. TCF11 and p45 NF-E2 fusion constructs were made by cloning PCR-generated p45 NF-E2 fragments (verified by sequencing) into the appropriate sites in the TCF11 expression construct pcA20 as follows. The sequence coding for the TAD fragment was PCR amplified with primers 1 and 2 and ligated to the HindIII (polylinker of pcDNA3)/BamHI (bp 2263) fragment of pcA20. The construct was named NATDB (p45 NF-E2 activating domain fused to TCF11 DNA binding domain). The sequence coding for the TAD fragment was PCR amplified with primers 1 and 3 and ligated to theHindIII/BsgI (bp 2003) fragment of pcA20 (named NASerTDB). The sequence coding for the DBD fragment was PCR amplified with primers 4 and 5 and ligated to the BsrGI (1599)/XbaI (polylinker of pcDNA3) fragment of pcA20 (named TANDB).

K562 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, sodium pyruvate, and 0.25% glucose at 37 °C in 5% CO2. COS-1, HeLa, or HepG2 cells were transfected at 50–80% confluence either using a standard calcium phosphate procedure (16Johnsen O. Murphy P. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) or FuGENE 6, following the supplier's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For calcium phosphate transfection, 5 μg of TCF11 expression construct, 2 μg of PBGD3.2Luc reporter (16Johnsen O. Murphy P. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and 1 μg of internal control (pRSVCAT)/10-cm dish were used. The luciferase gene in the PBGD3.2Luc reporter is under the control of a part of the porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) gene promoter. It has been shown previously that TCF11 activates the reporter through the single NF-E2 site in the promoter region (16Johnsen O. Murphy P. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A total of 1.0–2.2 μg of DNA/3.5-cm dish was used during FuGENE 6 transfections together with 2–6 μl of transfection reagent. The DNA mixture consisted typically of 0.2 μg of PBGD3.2Luc reporter construct, various amounts of different TCF11 and/or p45 NF-E2 expression constructs, and empty pcDNA3 vector to the required total amount of DNA. K562 cells were transfected with DEMRIE-C transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the supplier's instructions. A mixture of 4 μg of DNA together with 4 μl of DEMRIE-C transfection reagent was used to transfect 2.0 × 106 cells. The DNA mixture consisted typically of 0.8 μg of PBGD3.2Luc reporter construct, 0.4 μg of internal control (pRSVCAT), various amounts of TCF11 and/or p45 NF-E2 expression constructs, and empty vector to achieve the required total amount of DNA. The cells were harvested at two days post-transfection in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.8, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100). The luciferase activity was measured on a MicroLumat Plus luminometer (EG&G Berthold). 5–50 μl of cell extract was diluted in luciferase mixture buffer (10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 50 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.8, 2 mm ATP) to a total volume of 200 μl. 100 μl of 1 mm luciferin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals 1626353) was added to each sample. CAT activity was measured using a standard protocol (16Johnsen O. Murphy P. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized either by comparison with CAT activity or with the total protein content in the sample, determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay with 3–5 μl of the cell extract. The levels of luciferase induction after transfection with TCF11 or other expressing constructs are given as relative activity compared with the activity obtained by the empty vector alone. COS-1, HeLa, or K562 cells were transfected as described previously. After 2 days of incubation the cells were harvested using standard methods for cells growing either in monolayer or in suspension (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.62-18.63Google Scholar). Protein extracts were separated using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (running buffer: 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS) then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (blotting buffer: 20% (v/v) methanol, 200 mm glycine, and 25 mm Tris). After transfer, the membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST (165 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were incubated with primary antibody (anti-TCF11 diluted 1:16,000 in TBST containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (12Johnsen O. Skammelsrud N. Luna L. Nishizawa M. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4289-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with secondary antibody (anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:5,000 in TBST containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)) for 1 h at room temperature. The immune complexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and detected with x-ray film. In vitro dimerization between TCF11 or MafG and different TCF11 variants, p45 NF-E2, or chimeric proteins was performed as described previously (12Johnsen O. Skammelsrud N. Luna L. Nishizawa M. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4289-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, MBP, MBP-TCF11-A, and MBP-MafG were bacterially expressed and purified on amylose resin (New England Biolabs). The different variants of TCF11, p45 NF-E2, and the chimeric proteins were translated in vitro using the TNT-coupledin vitro transcription/translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine and incubated with the desired MBP fusion by gently mixing overnight at 4 °C in dimerization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors. Unbound proteins were removed by washing three times with the dimerization buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by denaturation in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2% SDS, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue), separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. In vitro assays have previously revealed two major translation isoforms of TCF11 (2Chan J.Y. Han X.L. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11371-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), the second, smaller isoform presumably being produced by translation initiation from an internal cluster of ATGs (Fig.1). We confirm this observation both in cell culture and with in vitro transcription/translation assays. This is not unexpected because there is a non-optimal Kozak sequence at the initial methionine (22Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar). TCF11 produced from a full-length cDNA, where both isoforms can potentially be produced, can specifically bind to and transactivate through the NF-E2 site in the PBGD promoter (16Johnsen O. Murphy P. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We wished to investigate if either or both of the major translation products were involved and if they showed any differences in their ability to induce expression of a reporter. To test this, we have used a transient transfection assay expressing two differentially spliced cDNAs that can produce both full-length and internally initiated protein and a truncated cDNA that can only produce the short isoform. The reporter induction occurs through a single NF-E2 site in the assay. Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of the full-length TCF11 protein with functional domains indicated, a variant of the protein caused by alternative splicing (long variant), and the shorter protein resulting from internal translation initiation. Initiation from the internal methionine cluster yields a short isoform of 447 amino acids, whereas full-length TCF11 is 772 amino acids (1Luna L. Johnsen O. Skartlien A.H. Pedeutour F. Turc-Carel C. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Genomics. 1994; 22: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The long variant transcript yields a product of 731 amino acids (Fig. 1) because of the omission of exons 3a and 4 in the N-terminal acid-rich domain (23Luna L. Skammelsrud N. Johnsen O. Abel K.J. Weber B.L. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Genomics. 1995; 27: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In a transient transfection assay the different protein products show variation in their ability to induce luciferase expression. COS-1 cells transiently transfected with clones that produced either of the longer translation products (long and long variant) showed a significant luciferase induction (Fig. 2 a,second and third bars). In contrast, in cells where only the shorter translation product can be produced, no luciferase induction above background level was observed (Fig.2 a, fourth bar). The same results were obtained with transiently transfected HeLa or HepG2 cells (data not shown). The omission of the two small exonic sequences (exons 3a and 4; 41 amino acids) in the acid-rich domain of the long variant of TCF11 did not show a detectable difference in the ability to activate the reporter under the conditions used (Fig. 2 a, comparesecond and third bars). To examine the expression of the different translation products the proteins were analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 2 b). The full-length clone gave rise to three different equally expressed protein forms: two large proteins of ∼160 and 140 kDa, and a shorter protein of 65 kDa, which is the expected size for the internally initiated translation product (Fig. 2 b, second lane) (2Chan J.Y. Han X.L. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11371-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The alternatively spliced clone gave rise to two different translation products: a longer form of 140 kDa and the internally initiated product (Fig. 2 b, third lane). The incomplete clone gave only the shorter protein form (Fig. 2 b, fourth lane). The total amount of TCF11 protein detected was much higher when only the shorter protein form was produced. To examine if the observed inability of TCF11 short form to activate the reporter in the transient transfection assay was caused by a difference in dimerization ability, an MBP pulldown assay was performed. The dimerization ability of different in vitrotranslated variants of TCF11 was tested (Fig. 2 c). The long, long variant, and the short form all showed specific dimerization with both the MBP-TCF11-A fusion protein (Fig. 2 c,sixth, eighth, and ninth lanes) and MBP-MafG (data not shown) (12Johnsen O. Skammelsrud N. Luna L. Nishizawa M. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4289-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). No dimerization was observed in the control reaction between long TCF11 and MBP (Fig. 2 c,fifth lane). This implies that dimerization ability is not altered in the various forms. To characterize further the activity of the short form, a transient transfection assay with coexpression of TCF11 short form and MafG was performed (Fig. 3). This showed that TCF11 short form in the presence of MafG was still not able to transactivate expression under these conditions (Fig. 3,sixth and seventh bars), although an MBP pulldown assay showed that the two proteins could dimerize (data not shown). On the other hand MafG expressed alone repressed reporter expression (Fig.3, fifth bar) whereas coexpression with TCF11 short form reduced the repression caused by MafG (Fig. 3, seventh bar). However, MafG coexpressed with p45 NF-E2 activated reporter expression (Fig. 3. eighth bar). Because transactivation in our transient transfection assay in COS-1, HeLa, and HepG2 cells was achieved only under conditions where either of the longer proteins was produced, we wished to examine if the observed activation was dependent on the expression of a longer form alone or a combination of a longer and the shorter form. To address this we produced a mutated construct that produces only the longer protein form (Fig. 1, long mutated). In the mutated form four methionine residues (Met-318, Met-321, Met-323, and Met-326), which are possible internal translation initiation start sites, were changed into leucine residues, and thereby internal initiation was prevented. This was confirmed by in vitro expression (Fig. 2 c,second lane) and Western blotting (Fig.4 a, third lane), and the protein product was shown to dimerize with both MBP-TCF11-A (Fig. 2 c, seventh lane) and MBP-MafG (data not shown). Expression of the mutated form in the transient transfection assay showed an enhanced transactivation ability compared with TCF11 long form (Fig. 4 b, compare second andthird bars). This enhanced activity was observed when several different amounts of DNA were used in the transfections (Fig.4 c, compare sixth, seventh, andeighth bars with third, fourth, andfifth bars). When either the longer form or the longer mutated form was coexpressed with TCF11 short form the transactivation abilities were reduced (Fig. 4 c, compare ninththrough twelfth bars with third throughfifth bars, and thirteenth throughsixteenth bars with sixth througheighth). This implies that the presence of short form TCF11 can actually interfere with the activity of TCF11 long form. To examine if the introduced leucine residues had any effect on the protein expression, extracts from transiently transfected cells were analyzed by Western blot. The mutated long form was expressed at the same level as TCF11 long form (Fig. 4 a, comparethird with second lane). Coexpression of the short form with either long or long mutated form had no effect on the level of protein expression (Fig. 4 a, fifth andsixth lanes). From these results we conclude that the region N-terminal to the internal methionine cluster is necessar"
https://openalex.org/W1982463934,"CEACAM1 is a cell-cell adhesion molecule that mediates homophilic cell adhesion. In addition, CEACAM1 was also shown to suppress the growth of prostate, breast, and colon tumors. Structural and functional analyses showed that the adhesion activity of CEACAM1 is mediated by its extracellular domain while its cytoplasmic domain is necessary and sufficient for growth-inhibitory activity. The signal pathways leading to CEACAM1-mediated growth suppression are not known. We studied the importance of phosphorylation of serine 503 in this growth-inhibitory signaling pathway. Full-length CEACAM1 was found to be phosphorylated in vivo in both tyrosine and serine residues. Mutation of tyrosine 488 to phenylalanine did not abolish the tumor-suppressive activity of CEACAM1, suggesting that phosphorylation at tyrosine 488 is not critical for CEACAM1's tumor-suppressive activity. Although expression of CEACAM1's cytoplasmic domain inhibited the growth of DU145 prostate cancer cells in vivo, mutation of serine 503 to alanine abolished the growth-inhibitory activity. In addition, the change of serine 503 to aspartic acid produced tumor-suppressive activity similar to that of the wild-type CEACAM1. These results suggested that phosphorylation at serine 503 is essential for CEACAM1's growth-inhibitory functionin vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2018697124,"MAP kinase signaling pathways are important mediators of cellular responses to a wide variety of stimuli. Signals pass along these pathways via kinase cascades in which three protein kinases are sequentially phosphorylated and activated, initiating a range of cellular programs including cellular proliferation, immune and inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. One such cascade involves the mixed lineage kinase, MLK2, signaling through MAP kinase kinase 4 and/or MAP kinase kinase 7 to the SAPK/JNK, resulting in phosphorylation of transcription factors including the oncogene, c-jun. Recently we showed that MLK2 causes apoptosis in cultured neuronal cells and that this effect is dependent on activation of the JNK pathway (Liu, Y. F., Dorow, D. S., and Marshall, J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 19035–19040). Furthermore, dominant-negative MLK2 blocked apoptosis induced by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin protein, the product of the mutant Huntington's disease gene. Here we show that as well as activating the stress-signaling pathway, MLK2 is a target for phosphorylation by activated JNK. Phosphopeptide mapping of MLK2 proteins revealed that activated JNK2 phosphorylates multiple sites mainly within the noncatalytic C-terminal region of MLK2 including the C-terminal 100 amino acid peptide. In addition, MLK2 is phosphorylated in vivo within several of the same C-terminal peptides phosphorylated by JNK2 in vitro, and this phosphorylation is increased by cotransfection of JNK2 and treatment with the JNK activator, anisomycin. Cotransfection of dominant-negative JNK kinase inhibits phosphorylation of kinase-negative MLK2 by anisomycin-activated JNK. Furthermore, we show that the N-terminal region of MLK2 is sufficient to activate JNK but that removal of the C-terminal domain abrogates the apoptotic response. Taken together, these data indicate that the apoptotic activity of MLK2 is dependent on the C-terminal domain that is the main target for MLK2 phosphorylation by activated JNK.

A group of signaling pathways that are highly conserved through evolution are collectively known as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 pathways (3Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J.

Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The classical MAPK pathway is triggered by growth factors binding to cell surface receptors leading to the activation of the GTPase, Ras. This pathway results in activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) leading to gene transcription and cellular proliferation. A parallel MAPK pathway triggered by stress factors such as osmotic shock, UV irradiation, cytotoxic drugs, and inflammatory cytokines results in activation of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinases (SAPK/JNKs) (2Karin M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). A second stress-activated pathway leads to activation of p38 MAPK. Effects of stress activation vary from proliferation, differentiation, and gene transcription to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis depending on cell type and stimulus (2Karin M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). All MAPK pathways utilize a “three-kinase cascade” mechanism to modulate incoming signals. Thus, each MAPK has upstream-activating kinases (MAPKKs) that are in turn regulated by MAPKK kinases (MAPKKKs) (reviewed in Ref. 5Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. Essays Biochem. 1997; 32: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the upstream kinases appear to be highly specific for a particular cascade, whereas others link to more than one MAPK. The MAPKKs for the ERKs are the MAP/ERK kinases (MEKs) (6Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J.

In the case of p38, the main upstream-activating kinases are MKK3 and MKK6 (11Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J.

MAPKKKs are a larger group of kinases that have overlapping specificities for MAPKKs and are themselves activated by an array of interactions in response to extracellular and internal stimuli (reviewed in Ref. 17Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). As more upstream activators of the MAPKs are identified, the picture of how these three parallel pathways are regulated becomes more complex. Recently it has become clear that MAPKs not only control downstream signals to transcription factors but also exert effects upstream on their activators. In budding yeast, the three components of the pheromone-induced MAPK cascade are Ste11 ⇒ Ste7 ⇒ Fus3/KSS (18Neiman A.M. Herskowitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

Within their N-terminal regions, MLKs 1–3 contain several domains associated with protein interaction including an Src homology (SH3) domain and two leucine zipper motifs (24Dorow D.S. Devereux L.

In addition, each has a large C-terminal domain of unknown function that is rich in serine, threonine, and proline amino acids. Recently we reported that overexpression of active full-length MLK2 causes apoptosis in neuronal cells, and this is dependent on activation of JNK (31Liu Y.F. Dorow D.S. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19035-19040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Transfection of kinase-negative MLK2 inhibits neuronal cell apoptosis caused by expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin protein, the gene product associated with neuronal pathology in Huntington's disease (32MacDonald M.E. Gusella J.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 5: 638-643Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M. Cozens B. Harper A. Hetherington C. Lawton M. Trottier Y. Lehrach H. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Cell. 1996; 87: 493-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2592) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of the N-terminal region of normal huntingtin protein partially rescues this neuronal toxicity. A proline-rich peptide near the polyglutamine insertion site in the N-terminal region of normal huntingtin protein binds to the SH3 domain of MLK2, and polyglutamine expansion interferes with this interaction. As MLK2 is expressed at high levels in the brain, these results suggest a role for MLK2 in the neuronal pathology associated with polyglutamine expansion of huntingtin protein. In the present report, we investigated signaling of MLK2 in the JNK pathway and found that as well as being an activator of the SAPK/JNKs, MLK2 is a substrate of activated MAPKs. JNK phosphorylation occurs at a number of specific sites mainly within the C-terminal region of the MLK2 protein, including the C-terminal 100 amino acid peptide. Furthermore, the MLK2 C-terminal domain is phosphorylated in vivo, and this phosphorylation increases after activation of JNK by anisomycin treatment. In studies of MLK2 expression in epithelial cells, wild-type MLK2 induced apoptosis, and this is dependent on both its catalytic activity and the presence of the noncatalytic C-terminal domain. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the MLK2 C-terminal domain is a target for regulation by activated JNK and is vital for MLK2-induced apoptosis.

The MLK2-K125A (KN-MLK2) mutant was made using the Altered Sites® II in vitro mutagenesis kit (Promega) essentially according to manufacturer's instructions, with the following modifications. Taq polymerase (8 units/30 μl) was substituted for T4 polymerase in the second strand synthesis reaction, and mutant plasmid DNA was transfected into Escherichia coli ES1301 mutS by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. The mutagenesis template for KN-MLK2, a BamHI fragment containing the first 1488 base pairs of the coding region of human MLK2 cDNA (24Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Tu G.-F. Price G. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Simpson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), was subcloned into the pALTER-1 vector (Promega). The oligonucleotide used to create the MLK2-K125A mutation was 5′-146AGGAGGTGGCAGTCGCGGCCGCCCGGCTGG176(altered bases underlined) based on the MLK2 nucleotide sequence. The entire nucleotide sequence of the mutated insert was confirmed by automated nucleotide sequence analysis on an ABI Prism model 373 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) before re-inserting into HA-pKH3-HA-MLK2 vector. COS7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 20 μg/ml (20 IU) gentamicin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. Cells (0.5–1 × 106) were transiently transfected with 2–5 μg plasmid DNA using FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent, electroporation, or CaPO4. For phosphopeptide mapping experiments, 4 × 106 COS7 cells were transfected by electroporation with 5 μg of HA-MLK2 pKH3, HA-KN-MLK2 pKH3, HA-C-MLK2 pKH3, and/or 3 μg of HA-JNK2 pSR3α and incubated in complete DMEM at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air for 24–36 h. For anisomycin treatment, JNK2-expressing cells were washed after 12 h with serum-free DMEM and incubated in serum-free conditions for 24 h. In some cultures, JNK2 was activated by addition of 10 μg/ml anisomycin to serum-starved cells for 30 min before harvest. For stable transfectants, HEK 293 cells were electroporated with 5 μg of pEGFPC1 mutant MLK2 cDNA, and the cells were grown in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 antibiotic. Clones of resistant cells were isolated and assayed by microscopy for expression of the GFP fusion protein and by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibodies to confirm the size of the expressed fusion protein. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, and 1.5 mm MgCl2) containing proteinase inhibitors (1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 50 mm NaPO4. Lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min and then clarified by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Lysate protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (36Smith P.K. Krohn R.L. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fugimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18638) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, aliquots of cellular lysate containing 30 μg of protein were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and proteins transferred to nitrocellulose. For immune complex kinase assays (IP kinase assays), HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysate volumes adjusted to contain equal amounts of protein with anti-HA antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose beads. Beads were resuspended in 30 μl of assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 100 μmNaVO4, and 10% glycerol) containing 60 μmATP and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature before proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and incorporated radioactivity was analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). Assays were repeated in triplicate, and raw data were corrected for protein expression levels as determined by anti-HA immunoblotting of an aliquot of each cell lysate. MLK2 tryptic phosphopeptides were separated on two-dimensional thin layer cellulose essentially by the method of Hunter and co-workers (37Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphorylated proteins were excised from polyacrylamide gels and the gel slices suspended in 200 μl of 20 mm NH4HCO3.l-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (10 μg) was added, and the digest was allowed to proceed for 18 h at 37 °C. A total of 4 × 103 cpm/digest were dried and resuspended in electrophoresis buffer, loaded onto thin layer cellulose plates, and peptides resolved in two dimensions by electrophoresis followed by ascending chromatography. The electrophoresis buffer was 2% formic acid and 7.8% acetic acid in H2O, pH 1.9, and chromatography was in 37.5%n-butyl alcohol, 25% pyridine, and 7.5% acetic acid in H2O. Labeled peptides were visualized by PhosphorImage analysis of the thin layer plates. COS7 cells were transfected with pKH3-HA-KN-MLK2 together with either pSRα-HA-JNK2 or empty vector and incubated for 24 h in complete DMEM. For cells transfected with JNK2, complete DMEM was replaced with serum-free DMEM, and cells were incubated for a further 18 h. The medium of all cells was then replaced with phosphate-free DMEM with or without 10% dialyzed FCS for 2 h. Cells were then incubated with [32P]orthophosphoric acid (200 μCi per ml of medium) alone or together with 10 μg/ml anisomycin for 30 min. Cells were harvested and proteins immunoprecipitated with anti HA-antibodies. Following electrophoresis, the KN-MLK2 protein was subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping as described above. Following tryptic digestion of phosphorylated MLK2 protein, extracted peptides were incubated with constant boiling HCl at 95 °C for 120 min. After drying, amino acids were dissolved in 7.5% acetic acid, 25% pyridine, 37.5%n-butyl alcohol in H2O, resolved on a thin layer cellulose plate at 1500 V for 2 h, and visualized by PhosphorImage analysis. Cells grown on glass coverslips were incubated for 10 min in fixing solution (4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 5 mmMgSO4, 10 mm EGTA, and 2 mmdithiothreitol), permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, and treated with RNase (400 μg/ml) for 30 min. Cells were stained with propidium iodide (1 μg/ml, 20 min) before mounting coverslips onto glass slides. Confocal images were captured using a Bio-Rad MRC-1000 Confocal Imaging System. Within MAPK cascades, preferences for activation of particular components or downstream targets have been reported in various cell types or activation conditions. In the case of the JNK cascade, differential involvement of SAPK/JNK isoforms in growth regulation and apoptosis induction has been demonstrated in several different cell types (38Potapova O. Gorospe M. Dougherty R.H. Dean N.M. Gaarde W.A. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1713-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 39Cerezo A. Martinez-A C. Gonzalez A. Gomez J. Rebollo A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To determine whether MLK2 activation of the SAPK pathway leads to preferential activation of JNK isoforms, COS7 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids for HA-MLK2 (Fig. 1) together with either HA-JNK1 or HA-JNK2. Lysates of the transfected cells were assayed for JNK activation in IP kinase assays using GST-c-Jun as a substrate. As a control for these experiments, a kinase-negative mutant in which alanine replaces lysine at position 125 in the MLK2 kinase catalytic domain (KN-MLK2) was prepared. Lysine 125 of MLK2 corresponds to lysine 72 of cyclic AMP-dependent kinase that is directly involved in the phospho-transfer reaction (40Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Ten Eyck L.F. Karlsson R. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) during catalysis. As can be seen in Fig. 1 B, there is very efficient phosphorylation of c-Jun by both JNK1 and JNK2 when isolated from cells expressing wild-type MLK2 (wt-MLK2), whereas both JNKs were essentially inactive toward c-Jun when coexpressed with KN-MLK2. Although JNK1 appears to be more highly activated than JNK2 in this assay, JNK1 has a higher basal activity and thus the degree of activation by MLK2 is about 8-fold for both JNKs (Fig. 1 C). In the course of analyzing SAPK/JNK signaling, COS7 cells expressing KN-MLK2 were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, a potent activator of JNK (2Karin M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In anti-HA immunoblots of recombinant MLK2 proteins from these cells, broadening of KN-MLK2 bands was evident (data not shown). This suggested that MLK2 is phosphorylated in vivo in response to anisomycin. However, due to the strong constitutive autophosphorylation activity of overexpressed wt-MLK2, this effect is only observable with the KN-MLK2 mutant. To determine whether activated JNK has ability to phosphorylate MLK2, HA-JNK2 was transfected into COS7 cells and immunoprecipitated after either serum starvation or anisomycin treatment of the cells. Immune complex kinase assays were performed with HA-KN-MLK2 that had been immunoprecipitated from separately transfected untreated COS7 cells as the added substrate (Fig. 2 A). This revealed low level phosphorylation of added KN-MLK2 by JNK2 isolated from serum-starved cells, and JNK2 isolated from anisomycin-treated cells phosphorylated KN-MLK2 efficiently. Anisomycin activation of JNK in the COS7 cells was confirmed by immunoblotting cellular lysates with anti-JNK antibodies where a clear bandshift in JNK from anisomycin-treated cells was observed (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). As coexpression of active MLK2 has a significant effect on JNK activity, we measured the ability of JNK2 to phosphorylate KN-MLK2 after activation by wt-MLK2. In this case, HA-JNK2 was coexpressed with FLAG-tagged versions of either wt-MLK2 or KN-MLK2 and the JNK2 selectively immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies. HA-KN-MLK2 was separately transfected into COS7 cells and immunoprecipitated. HA-KN-MLK2 immunoprecipitate was then added to the HA-JNK2 for a kinase reaction. As can be seen in Fig. 2 B, HA-JNK2 that had been coexpressed with active FLAG-MLK2 readily phosphorylated the added KN-MLK2. Where JNK2 was expressed either alone or coexpressed with FLAG-KN-MLK2, however, phosphorylation activity toward KN-MLK2 was reduced, and no phosphorylation of KN-MLK2 was detected in anti-HA immunoprecipitates from cells expressing FLAG-MLK2 alone (Fig.2 B, lane 3). This confirms that no active FLAG-MLK2 was present in the anti-HA immunoprecipitates and rules out the possibility that another kinase coimmunoprecipitating with KN-MLK2 may be responsible for the observed phosphorylation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that JNK2 activated either by coexpression of wt-MLK2 or the classical JNK activator, anisomycin, readily phosphorylates KN-MLK2 in vitro. The signaling pathway from MLK2 to JNK leading to JNK phosphorylation of MLK2 is depicted in the diagram in Fig. 2 C. To demonstrate the involvement of the JNK cascade further, we examined the requirement for JNKK activity in the ability of activated JNK to phosphorylate KN-MLK2 in vitro (Fig.2 D). For this, HA-JNK2 was coexpressed with either wild-type or kinase-negative JNKK, and the cells were activated with anisomycin. The HA-JNK was im"

In the present study we demonstrate that this hormone-induced decrease in [Mg2+]i is independent of [Ca2+]i but dependent on extracellular Na+. [Mg2+]i, [Ca2+]i, and [Na+]i were measured in Ang II-stimulated MDCK cells by fluorescence digital imaging using the selective fluoroprobes mag-fura-2AM, fura-2AM, and sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (acetoxymethyl ester), respectively. Ang II decreased [Mg2+]i and increased [Na+]i in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were inhibited by irbesartan (selective AT1receptor blocker) but not by PD123319 (selective AT2receptor blocker). Imipramine and quinidine (putative inhibitors of the Na+/Mg2+ exchanger) and removal of extracellular Na+ abrogated Ang II-mediated [Mg2+]i effects. In cells pretreated with thapsigargin (reticular Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor), Ang II-stimulated [Ca2+]i transients were attenuated (p < 0.01), whereas agonist-induced [Mg2+]i responses were unchanged. Clamping the [Ca2+]i near 50 nmol/liter with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) inhibited Ang II-induced [Ca2+]i increases but failed to alter Ang II-induced [Mg2+]i responses. Benzamil, a selective blocker of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, inhibited [Na+]i but not [Mg2+]i responses. Our data demonstrate that in MDCK cells, AT1 receptors modulate [Mg2+]i via a Na+-dependent Mg2+ transporter that is not directly related to [Ca2+]i. These data support the notion that rapid modulation of [Mg2+]i is not simply a result of Mg2+ redistribution from intracellular buffering sites by Ca2+ and provide evidence for the existence of a Na+-dependent, hormonally regulated transporter for Mg2+ in renally derived cells.

Magnesium, the second most abundant intracellular cation, plays an important role in cellular function. Intracellular Mg2+ is an essential cofactor for many enzymes, it modulates various transporters and ion channels, it regulates lipid- and phosphoinositide-derived second messengers, and it influences DNA and protein synthesis (1O'Rourke B.

Mg2+ is an important modulator of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and pHi, which are major determinants of cell contraction, secretion, and motility (6Nakajima T. Iwasawa K. Hazama H. Asano M. Okuda Y. Omata M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 320: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Gilbert D'Angelo E.K. Singer H.A. Rembold C.M. J. Clin.

Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that Mg2+ plays a major role in cell differentiation and proliferation by regulating transphosphorylations, DNA synthesis, and intracellular signaling (4Wolf F.I. Cittadini A. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 1-11Crossref Google Scholar). These physiological processes require that the intracellular free Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]i) be controlled within a narrow range. Mechanisms regulating [Mg2+]i have not been fully elucidated. Early reports suggested that intracellular sequestration of Mg2+does not contribute to [Mg2+]i homeostasis (9Grubbs R.D. Collins S.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12184-12192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these conclusions were based on studies of total cell Mg2+, not free [Mg2+]i, the physiologically important form of Mg2+. Mg2+ is not a static ion. It moves rapidly between intracellular compartments and across the plasma membrane (10Quamme G.A. Dai L.-J. Rabkin S.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H281-H288PubMed Google Scholar). Mg2+ enters cells along a concentration gradient and by facilitated diffusion (11Flatman P.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and is extruded from cells via a Na+/Mg2+ exchanger (11Flatman P.W. Annu. Rev.

The Na+/Mg2+ exchanger was first demonstrated in the squid giant axon where Na+ entry is coupled to Mg2+ moving out of the cell (14DeWeer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 68: 159-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Na+-dependent Mg2+ transport is inhibited by amiloride, quinidine, imipramine, and manganese, and it may be regulated by cAMP, protein kinase C, and the Na+/H+ antiporter (15Gunther T. Vormann J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Feray J.C. Garay R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 856: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Touyz R.M.

Although the transporter has been functionally demonstrated, it has not yet been cloned or characterized. A P-type ATPase has been cloned from bacteria and has been implicated in Mg2+ transport; however, whether such an enzyme exists in mammalian cells is unclear (20Snavely M.D. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 256: 815-823Google Scholar). Another Mg2+ transporter, the Mg2+/H+exchanger, has recently been fully characterized in plant cells but not in mammalian cells (21Shaul O.

Increasing evidence suggests that humoral factors influence transmembrane kinetics of Mg2+ to regulate cellular actions of these hormones by modulating signal transduction pathways. Small changes in [Mg2+]i can have significant effects on biological responses. Studies with perfused heart and liver, as well as with cardiac myocytes and hepatocytes, have demonstrated that Mg2+ fluxes are under the control of various hormones, such as insulin, endothelin-1, norepinephrine, epinephrine, aldosterone, and arginine vasopressin (22Murphy E.

We recently reported that angiotensin II (Ang II),1 a potent vasoactive agent, modulates [Mg2+]i in vascular smooth muscle cells and in platelets (17Touyz R.M. Schiffrin E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24353-24358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Touyz R.M. Schiffrin E.L. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Touyz R.M. Schiffrin E.L. J. Hypertens. 1993; 11: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the mechanisms underlying Mg2+regulation by Ang II, and it is unknown whether Ang II influences Mg2+ metabolism in kidney cells, a major site for Ang II actions. The present study was therefore undertaken to examine Ang II effects on [Mg2+]i in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, using the fluorescent indicator dye mag-fura-2 (30Raju B. Murphy E. Levy L.A. Hall R.D. London R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C540-C548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulatory mechanisms whereby Ang II modulates [Mg2+]i were also investigated. Our findings demonstrate that in MDCK cells Ang II decreases [Mg2+]i via AT1 receptors. These effects are not related to changes in [Ca2+]i but are dependent on extracellular Na+ and a quinidine- and imipramine-sensitive transporter. These data suggest that rapid modulation of [Mg2+]i is not simply a result of Mg2+ redistribution from intracellular buffering sites by Ca2+ and provide evidence for the existence of a Na+-dependent, Ang II-regulated transporter for Mg2+ in renally derived cells. Mag-fura-2AM, fura-2AM, mag-fura-2, sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (acetoxymethyl ester), and gramicidin were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). PD123319, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester), Bay K 8644, and thapsigargin were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Irbesartan was a kind gift from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. All other reagents were from Sigma and ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Irvine, CA). MDCK cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATTC, Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, HEPES, penicillin, and streptomycin and grown on round glass coverslips and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator (95% air, 5% CO2) as previously described (31Touyz R.M. Tolloczko B. Schiffrin E.L. J. Hypertens. 1994; 12: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). At subconfluence, cells were rendered quiescent by serum deprivation for 30 h prior to experimentation. The selective fluorescent probe mag-fura-2AM was used to measure [Mg2+]i. Cells were washed with modified Hanks' buffered saline solution containing (in mmol/liter): 137 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 4.2 NaHCO3, 3 Na2HPO4, 0.4 KH2PO4, 1.3 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 0.8 MgSO4, 10 glucose, Hepes, pH 7.4 and loaded with mag-fura-2AM (4 μmol/liter), which was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide with 0.02% pluronic acid. Cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then washed with warmed buffer and incubated for a further 15 min to ensure complete deesterification. Under these loading conditions, the ratiometric (343/380 nm) fluorescence cell images were homogeneous, indicating that there was no significant intracellular compartmentation of mag-fura-2. The coverslip containing cells was placed in a stainless steel chamber and mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 135, Zeiss) as previously described (31Touyz R.M. Tolloczko B. Schiffrin E.L. J. Hypertens. 1994; 12: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of Ang II (10−12–10−6mol/liter). In some experiments, cells were pretreated (15 min) with 10−5 mol/liter irbesartan (AT1receptor antagonist) or PD123319 (AT2 receptor blocker). [Mg2+]i was measured in multiple cells simultaneously by fluorescence digital imaging (Attofluor Ratiovision, Zeiss) using an emission wavelength of 520 nm and alternating excitatory wavelengths of 343 and 380 nm (30Raju B. Murphy E. Levy L.A. Hall R.D. London R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C540-C548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Attofluor system was calibrated by viewing mag-fura-2, tetrapotassium salt solutions containing zero and saturating Mg2+ concentrations and including these data in the ratio calculations for construction of a standard curve relating Mg2+ concentration to the 343/380 ratio. The curve was derived from the equation [Mg2+]i (in mmol/liter) =Kd [(R − Rmin)/(Rmax− R)] × β (30Raju B. Murphy E. Levy L.A. Hall R.D. London R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C540-C548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where R is the ratio of fluorescence at 343 and 380 nm, Rmax and Rmin are the ratios for mag-fura free acid at 343 and 380 nm in the presence of saturating Mg2+ and zero Mg2+, respectively, and β is the ratio of fluorescence of mag-fura-2 at 380 nm in zero and saturating magnesium. Kd is the dissociation constant of mag-fura-2 for Mg2+ and is assumed to be 1.5 mmol/liter (30Raju B. Murphy E. Levy L.A. Hall R.D. London R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C540-C548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Video images of fluorescence at 520 nm emission were obtained using an intensified charge-coupled device camera system with the output digitized to a resolution of 512 × 480 pixels. Images of fluorescence ratios were obtained by dividing, pixel by pixel, the 343 nm image after background subtraction by the 380 nm image after background subtraction. For determination of the mag-fura-2 fluorescence spectrum, mag-fura-2-loaded cells were exposed to graded Mg2+ buffers or graded Ca2+ buffers. The buffers were identical in composition with the Hanks' buffer as indicated above, apart from a variable concentration of MgCl2/MgSO4 or CaCl2. Cells were lysed by addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 (final concentration). Excitation spectra were recorded, and the 343:380 nm ratio was determined. In some experiments [Ca2+]i was measured. The method used has been previously described in detail (31Touyz R.M. Tolloczko B. Schiffrin E.L. J. Hypertens. 1994; 12: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and was similar to that for [Mg2+]i described above. Briefly, cells were loaded with fura-2AM (4 μmol/liter) and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. [Ca2+]i was measured in washed cells by fluorescence digital imaging using excitation wavelengths of 343/380 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. Fura 2-pentapotassium salt was used for [Ca2+]i calibration, and the absolute Ca2+ concentration was determined from the Grynkiewicz formula as stated above for [Mg2+]i (32Grynkiewicz G. Poene M. Tsien T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The Kd for the fura-2-Ca2+ complex was assumed to be 224 nmol/liter (32Grynkiewicz G. Poene M. Tsien T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). [Na+]i was measured using the Na+-selective fluorescent probe SBFI-AM (33Harootunian A.T. Kao J.P.Y. Eckert B.K. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19458-19467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed with modified Hanks' buffered solution and loaded with SBFI-AM (4 μmol/liter) for 90 min at room temperature. The loaded cells were washed and incubated for a further 15 min. [Na+]iwas measured using an emission wavelength of 20 nm and alternating excitatory wavelengths of 343 and 380 nm. [Na+]iwas calibrated by equilibrating [Na+]i with the extracellular Na+ concentration using the monovalent cation ionophore gramicidin D (1 μmol/liter) (33Harootunian A.T. Kao J.P.Y. Eckert B.K. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19458-19467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Na+calibration solutions were made from appropriate mixtures of high Na+ and high K+ solutions. The former contained 90 mmol/liter sodium gluconate, 60 mmol/liter NaCl, 1.2 mmol/liter CaCl2, 10 mmol/liter Hepes; the high K+solution was identical except for complete replacement of Na+ by K+. The reference standards were adjusted to give final concentrations of 0–100 mmol/liter Na+ or K+. Cells were exposed to buffers in which the extracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]e) was varied from 10 to 80 mmol/liter. Thereafter, gramicidin D was added to clamp [Na+]i to [Na+]e. The final values of the 343/380 excitation ratio were plotted versus[Na+]e. The calibration curve, which was linear between 10 and 80 mmol/liter (r = 0.97;n = 5), was used to obtain [Na+]i. To determine the dependence of [Mg2+]i on Na+, [Mg2+]i responses to Ang II were measured in Na+-free solution. Cells were preincubated in Na+-free Hanks' buffer (Na+ isosmotically replaced with N-methylglucamine) for 15 min before [Mg2+]i measurement. To further assess the relationship between Mg2+ and Na+, [Mg2+]i responses were determined in cells that had been pre-exposed to imipramine or quinidine (0.5 mmol/liter), putative inhibitors of the Na+/Mg2+ exchanger (5Morrill G.A.

Commun. 1994; 202: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were pre-exposed to benzamil (10−5 mol/liter), which selectively inhibits the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (37Bkaily G. Jaalouk D. Sader S. Shbaklo H. Pothier P. Jacques D. D'Orleans-Juste P. Cragoe E.J. Bose R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 188: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Intracellular free Ca2+concentration was manipulated with 10−5mol/liter thapsigargin (endoplasmic reticular Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor) (38Jan C.R. Ho C.M. Wu S.N. Tseng C.J. Life Sci. 1999; 64: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or BAPTA-AM (50 μmol/liter), a high capacity chelator that selectively binds Ca2+ about 105 over Mg2+ (39Adams S.R. Kao J.P.Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 7959-7968Google Scholar). In these experiments cells were exposed to either agent for 10–15 min in Ca2+-free buffer (Hanks' buffer without CaCl2) before Ang II stimulation. Each experiment was repeated at least three times using different cell preparations. Data were calculated as the mean response per experiment and then as the mean of multiple experiments. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. and compared by Student's t test or by analysis of variance where appropriate. Tukey-Kramers' correction was used to compensate for multiple testing procedures. The Ang II concentration (mol/liter) eliciting 50% of the maximal response (EC50) or minimal response (IC50) was determined from concentration-response curves, which were fitted by nonlinear regression. Maximal (or minimal) responses to Ang II were expressed as Emax (or Emin) (in mmol/liter). Sensitivity to Ang II was expressed as pD2 = −log [EC50] (or pI2 = −log IC50) (in mol/liter). p < 0.05 was significant. The specificity of mag-fura for Mg2+ within the physiological Ca2+ range was studied by recording the fluorescence spectrum of mag-fura-2 in graded Ca2+ and Mg2+buffers. With increasing Mg2+ concentrations, the mag-fura-2 excitation ratio increased linearly, whereas the mag-fura-2 fluorescence spectrum was not influenced by Ca2+ (Fig.1A). To further demonstrate the specificity of mag-fura-2 for Mg2+, cells were exposed to the Ca2+ channel agonist Bay K 8644, which increases [Ca2+]i but not [Mg2+]i(37Bkaily G. Jaalouk D. Sader S. Shbaklo H. Pothier P. Jacques D. D'Orleans-Juste P. Cragoe E.J. Bose R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 188: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Bay K 8644 did not alter mag-fura-2 fluorescence but significantly increased fura-2 fluorescence (Fig. 1, B andC), indicating that elevations in [Ca2+]i do not influence mag-fura-2 fluorescence, at least within the range of concentrations tested. Resting levels of Mg2+, Na+, and Ca2+ in MDCK cells were 0.51 ± 0.02 mmol/liter (n = 135 cells), 17.6 ± 0.12 mmol/liter (n = 17 cells), and 84 ± 8.8 nmol/liter (n = 70 cells), respectively, consistent with previously reported values (40Quamme G.A. Dai L.-J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C521-C525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.2A demonstrates representative fluorescence tracings of Ang II effects on [Mg2+]i, [Na+]i, and [Ca2+]i in cells loaded with mag-fura-2AM, SBFI-AM, and fura-2AM, respectively. Ang II induced a small transient followed by a rapid decrease in mag-fura-2 fluorescence. This effect was sustained for up to 300 s following Ang II addition. SBFI-AM and fura-2AM fluorescence were increased by Ang II, indicating increased [Na+]i and [Ca2+]i. Maximal [Na+]i and [Ca2+]i responses, which occurred within 90 and 40 s, respectively, were sustained for up to 400 s following Ang II addition. Minimum fluorescence values for [Mg2+]i and maximum fluorescence values for [Na+]i and [Ca2+]i were used to generate full dose-response curves. As shown in Fig.2B, Ang II decreased [Mg2+]i(Emin = 0.38 ± 0.01 mmol/liter; pI2 = 8.8 ± 0.2) and increased [Na+]i (Emax = 53 ± 4 mmol/liter; pD2 = 8.5 ± 0.15) and [Ca2+]i (Emax = 618 ± 43 nmol/liter; pD2 = 8.0 ± 0.2) in a dose-dependent manner. To ascertain the receptor subtype through which Ang II mediates [Mg2+]i effects, cells were exposed to the AT1 receptor antagonist irbesartan or the selective AT2 receptor blocker PD123319. In cells pre-exposed to irbesartan, Ang II failed to elicit changes in [Mg2+]i, whereas in cells pretreated with PD123319, Ang II effects were unaltered (Fig.3). These data suggest that Ang II actions are mediated exclusively via the AT1 receptor subtype. Two approaches were used to determine whether Ang II modulates [Mg2+]i via Na+-dependent mechanisms. First, cells were incubated in Na+-free buffer, and second, cells were exposed to quinidine and imipramine, two different inhibitors of the Na+/Mg2+exchanger. As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, exposing cells to Na+-free buffer inhibited the Ang II-induced [Mg2+]i response. [Na+]ieffects were also blunted in Na+-free medium but were not completely abolished. In the absence of extracellular Na+, the magnitude of the [Ca2+]i response was unchanged, even though the time course was altered (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results indicate that Ang II-induced mobilization of intracellular Mg2+ does not directly involve an increase in [Ca2+]i, whereas changes in [Na+]i are required. The Na+dependence of Ang II-elicited [Mg2+]i responses suggests that a Na+/Mg2+ exchange mechanism may be operational.Figure 5Bar graphs demonstrate effects of Ang II (10−7 mol/liter) on MDCK cell [Mg2+]i, [Na+]i, and [Ca2+]i in the presence or absence of extracellular Na+. Na+-free Hanks' buffer was prepared by replacing Na+ withN-methylglucamine. Results are means ± S.E. of four to six experiments, with each experimental field comprising many cells. +,p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01versus basal counterpart.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As demonstrated in Figs. 6 and 7, quinidine and imipramine abrogated Ang II-elicited [Mg2+]ieffects. [Na+]i responses were reduced by both agents but were not completely inhibited (Figs. 6 and 7), indicating that in addition to the Na+/Mg2+ exchanger, other mechanisms control [Na+]i, possibly the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. To investigate whether this antiporter contributes to Na+ and Mg2+regulation by Ang II, the effects of benzamil, a selective inhibitor of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, were assessed. Benzamil significantly inhibited Ang II-induced Na+ responses but did not alter [Mg2+]i effects (Fig. 7). When cells were pretreated with imipramine and benzamil together, Ang II-induced [Na+]i responses were almost completely abolished (Fig. 7). These data suggest that whereas Mg2+ is regulated primarily via a Na+-dependent Mg2+ transporter, Na+ regulation by Ang II is mediated in large part via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.Figure 7Line graphs demonstrate effects of Ang II on [Mg2+]i and [Na+]i in MDCK cells in the absence and presence of imipramine (5 × 10−4mol/liter), the most effective inhibitor of the Na+/Mg2+ exchanger (36Wolf F.I. Di Francesco A. Covacci V. Cittadini A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with imipramine for 15–20 min prior to Ang II (10−7 mol/liter) addition. In some experiments cells were exposed to benzamil (10−5mol/liter), a selective inhibitor of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, or to imipramine + benzamil. Each data point is the mean ± S.E. of four to seven experiments, with each experimental field comprising 7–26 cells. *,p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01versus Ang II counterpart.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine whether Ang II influences [Mg2+]i by increasing [Ca2+]i, cells were exposed to BAPTA, which prevents [Ca2+]i elevation by clamping [Ca2+]i at 40–50 nmol/liter. Cells were also treated with thapsigargin, a potent endoplasmic reticular Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, which depletes reticular Ca2+ stores by preventing Ca2+ reuptake. In the presence of BAPTA, the Ang II-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was attenuated by >80%, whereas the Ang II-mediated decrease in [Mg2+]i was unchanged (Fig. 8). Pre-exposure of cells to thapsigargin in Ca2+-free buffer increased basal [Ca2+]i and attenuated Ang II-stimulated [Ca2+]i responses compared with cells in the absence of thapsigargin (Fig. 8). These results indicate that Ca2+ stores were diminished and that Ang II was unable to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ and to significantly increase [Ca2+]i. Thapsigargin did not alter basal [Mg2+]i or Ang II-induced [Mg2+]i responses (Fig. 6). Taken together, these data suggest that Ang II modulates [Mg2+]i via mechanisms that are not dependent on [Ca2+]ielevations. The major findings of the present study indicate that 1) Ang II decreases [Mg2+]i and increases [Na+]i and [Ca2+]i in MDCK cells in a dose-dependent manner, 2) these effects are blocked by irbesartan but not by PD123319, 3) Ang II-mediated [Mg2+]i effects are abrogated by quinidine and imipramine and in Na+-free buffer, 4) Ang II elicits significant [Mg2+]i responses even when [Ca2+]i effects are blunted, and 5) benzamil inhibits Ang II-induced [Na+]i responses but does not influence [Mg2+]i. These data suggest that in MDCK cells Ang II modulates [Mg2+]i via Na+-dependent, Ca2+-independent mechanisms that are regulated exclusively by AT1 receptors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Na+/Ca2+exchanger is a major regulator of [Na+]i, but not of [Mg2+]i, in Ang II-stimulated cells. Although Mg2+ is the most abundant intracellular divalent cation, little is known about underlying mechanisms controlling [Mg2+]i, and there is much controversy whether cytosolic Mg2+ functions as a second messenger and whether it is regulated by hormonal signaling. A recent editorial by Murphy (41Murphy E. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) on the “mysteries of magnesium homeostasis” concluded that the challenge for future research will be to elucidate whether agonists induce physiologically significant alterations in Mg2+fluxes. We demonstrate here that Ang II, an important regulator of renal function (42Quan A. Baum M. Nephron. 2000; 84: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), modulates [Mg2+]i in kidney-derived epithelial cells. [Mg2+]i was measured by ratio-imaging microscopy and the indicator mag-fura-2AM, which fluoresces upon binding with Mg2+ (30Raju B. Murphy E. Levy L.A. Hall R.D. London R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C540-C548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the affinity of mag-fura-2 for Ca2+ is greater than the affinity for Mg2+, physiological [Mg2+]i is 2–3 orders of magnitude greater than [Ca2+]i. Thus interference due to [Ca2+]i only becomes significant under extreme perturbations when [Ca2+]i is elevated to pharmacologically high levels. When [Ca2+]i is increased to 1 μmol/liter, the Ca2+-mag-fura-2 complex is <10% of the Mg2+-mag-fura-2 complex. In our previous and current studies, [Ca2+]i never reached levels as high as 1 μmol/liter, even when maximal doses of Ang II were used. Furthermore, we demonstrate here that mag-fura-2 fluorescence is unaffected by changes in [Ca2+]i, whereas it is increased by Mg2+ in a concentrationdependent manner. For these reasons, the fluorescence of cellular mag-fura-2 in the present study is considered to be closely and selectively associated with changes in [Mg2+]i. In unstimulated cells, [Mg2+]i was 0.51 ± 0.02 mol/liter, which is in agreement with previously reported values in MDCK cells (0.49 ± 0.03 mmol/liter) (40Quamme G.A. Dai L.-J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C521-C525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Basal [Mg2+]i is maintained within a narrow range by intracellular buffering processes and by specific and highly regulated Mg2+ influx pathways (40Quamme G.A. Dai L.-J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C521-C525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ang II decreased [Mg2+]i in a dose-dependent fashion. These effects were blocked by irbesartan, but not by PD123319, indicating the exclusive role of AT1 receptors in these processes. Similar findings have been reported in vascular smooth muscle cells (17Touyz R.M. Schiffrin E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24353-24358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but to our knowledge, these are the first data demonstrating that AT1receptors regulate [Mg2+]i in MDCK cells. Mg2+ exchanges, or is cotransported, with other ions, and it uses the electrochemical gradient of other ions to cross the plasma membrane. Na+ may be the counterion exchanged with Mg2+. The Na+/Mg2+ exchanger, inhibitable by imipramine and quinidine, has been functionally demonstrated in sublingual mucous acini, erythrocytes, hepatocytes, thymocytes, cardiac cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells (13Gunther T. Mag. Bull. 1996; 18: 1-6Google Scholar, 15Gunther T. Vormann J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,16Feray J.C. Garay R. Biochim. Biophys.

Bull. 1996; 18: 1-6Google Scholar) reported that the membrane-spanning Mg2+ transporter is bidirectional and that reversing the Na+ gradient results in net Mg2+ influx. In our experimental conditions, [Mg2+]i responses were temporally associated with [Na+]i changes and were completely abolished in Na+-free medium and by quinidine and imipramine, one of the most effective inhibitors of the antiporter, suggesting that Mg2+ modulation by Ang II is dependent on extracellular Na+ and that the Na+/Mg2+ exchanger is the major regulator of [Mg2+]i, exchanging extracellular Na+for intracellular Mg2+. The stoichiometry of this Ang II-activated exchanger in MDCK cells appears to be complex, and the exact coupling awaits clarification. Inhibitors of the Na+/Mg2+ antiporter abrogated [Mg2+]i responses but only partially decreased [Na+]i effects. These findings suggest that whereas the Na+/Mg2+ exchanger is the primary transporter for Mg2+, it contributes only partially to [Na+]i regulation by Ang II and that other mechanisms also control [Na+]i. To this end we investigated the role of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger by exposing cells to benzamil, a selective inhibitor of the transporter. Benzamil significantly decreased [Na+]i responses but did not influence [Mg2+]i. Inhibition of both antiporters with imipramine and benzamil blocked Ang II-stimulated [Na+]i responses. These findings demonstrate that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger does not control transmembrane Mg2+ fluxes in MDCK cells but that it plays an important role in Na+ transport. Similar findings for [Na+]i have been demonstrated in cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (37Bkaily G. Jaalouk D. Sader S. Shbaklo H. Pothier P. Jacques D. D'Orleans-Juste P. Cragoe E.J. Bose R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 188: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Some studies failed to show that intracellular Mg2+homeostasis is regulated by Na+-dependent mechanisms and suggested that changes in [Mg2+]iare due primarily to changes in Ca2+ (22Murphy E. Freudenrich C.C. Levy L.A. London R.E. Lieberman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2981-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Because Ca2+ and Mg2+ bind to many common intracellular sites, an increase in [Ca2+]i could displace Mg2+ from mutual binding sites, thereby altering [Mg2+]i. In cardiomyocytes and isolated hearts, [Mg2+]i regulation is not due to Na+/Mg2+ exchange but appears to be secondary to changes in [Ca2+]i, which is influenced by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (22Murphy E. Freudenrich C.C. Levy L.A. London R.E. Lieberman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2981-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 48Buri A. McGuigan J.A. Exp. Physiol. 1990; 75: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In sublingual acini, muscarinic-induced Mg2+ mobilization is both Na+- and Ca2+-dependent (34Zhang G.H. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29067-29072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In MDCK cells, Quamme and Dai (40Quamme G.A. Dai L.-J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C521-C525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that Mg2+ refill into Mg2+-depleted cells is regulated by a verapamil-dependent pathway. In the present study we explored the role of [Ca2+]i on [Mg2+]i regulation, by depleting endoplasmic reticular Ca2+ stores with the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin and by clamping [Ca2+]i at about 50 mmol/liter with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM. Under these conditions, Ang II-induced [Ca2+]iresponses were blunted, but [Mg2+]i transients were unaltered, indicating that in MDCK cells [Mg2+]i regulation by Ang II is not dependent on intracellular Ca2+ mobilization or on increased [Ca2+]i. Possible Ca2+-insensitive signaling cascades whereby Ang II influences [Mg2+]i could be via protein kinase C and the Na+/H+ exchanger, which we previously demonstrated to be functionally linked to the Na+/Mg2+ exchanger (17Touyz R.M. Schiffrin E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24353-24358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that Ang II mobilizes intracellular Mg2+ in renally derived cells through AT1 receptor-mediated pathways. Ang II decreases [Mg2+]i by activating the Na+/Mg2+ exchanger to promote transmembrane Mg2+ transport in a Ca2+-independent fashion. These processes may play an important role in [Mg2+]i homeostasis and in Mg2+-dependent intracellular signaling pathways that do not require changes in [Ca2+]i. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is a major regulator of [Na+]i, but not of [Mg2+]i, in Ang II-stimulated cells. Our results support the notion that rapid modulation of [Mg2+]i is not simply a result of Mg2+ redistribution from intracellular buffering sites by Ca2+ and provide evidence for the existence of a Na+-dependent, hormonally regulated transporter for Mg2+ in renal epithelial cells. angiotensin II Madin-Darby canine kidney"

Similar highly active pure photosynthetic subcomplexes have been assembled up to now only by incubating an isolated native CF1(αβ) complex with a native (10Gao F. Lipscomb B. Wu I. Richter M. J.

Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar) demonstrated the alternating arrangement of the α and β subunits in a closed hexamer, with the resolved N- and C-terminal α-helices of the γ subunit embedded in its central cavity and all six nucleotide-binding sites residing at alternating α/β interfaces. The three catalytic sites, located mainly on the β subunits, appeared in three different conformational states that, in association with the unique resolved part of the γ subunit, imposed an asymmetric structure on the α3β3hexamer (12Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). This MF1-α3β3γ structure is compatible with the binding change mechanism (3Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar, 13Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), which proposed that ATP synthesis involves transitions between different but interacting catalytic sites, via energy-dependent affinity changes in substrate binding and product release. Such transitions were first suggested to occur via movement or rotation of a cluster of the catalytic α3β3 subunits around a core of the single copy γ or ε subunits (14Boyer P.D. Kohlbrenner W.E. Selman B.R. Selman-Reisner S. Energy Coupling in Photosynthesis. Elsevier/North Holland, 1981: 231-240Google Scholar). The reversible proton-translocating ATP hydrolysis was later proposed to generate rotation of the F1-γ subunit which, when transmitted to F0, could result in pumping of protons back across the membrane (15Fillingame R.H. The Bacteria. XII. Academic Press, 1990: 345-391Google Scholar), possibly via coupled rotation of the F1-γ subunit with the F0-c subunits (3Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar, 16Vik S. Antonio B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MgATPase-induced rotation of γ within immobilized α3β3 hexamers was observed in genetically engineered respiratory TF1- and EcF1-α3β3γ complexes (17Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar,18Omote H. Sambonmatsu N. Saito K. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto K.A. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7780-7784Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). But its further coupling with F0-c rotation, which has been tested in some recent reports, did not yield clear results (19Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 20Tsunoda S.P. Aggeler R. Noji H. Kinosita K.J. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A.

So there is at present no direct correlation between γ rotation and proton-coupled ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. Full elucidation of the detailed mechanism of action of the F0F1-ATP synthase will depend on the identification of the specific domains that participate in its proton-coupled ATP synthesis and hydrolysis as well as in the regulation of these reversible activities and their possible correlation with the γ or γ-c rotation. Tight regulation of ATP hydrolysis is especially important in photosynthetic cells, where it prevents the depletion of essential cellular ATP pools in the dark (1Gromet-Elhanan Z. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 807-830Google Scholar,4Richter M.L. Hein R. Huchzermeyer B. Biochim.

Biol. 2000; 51: 83-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plant chloroplasts and bacterial chromatophores have a number of such regulatory pathways, which operate in their membrane-bound F0F1- as well as the solubilized F1-ATPases. Both chloroplasts (22Hochman Y. Lanir A. Carmeli C. FEBS Lett. 1976; 61: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and chromatophores (23Gromet-Elhanan Z. Weiss S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3645-3650Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) show a high sensitivity to inhibition by excess free Mg2+ions, which results in a drastic decrease of their MgATPase activities at Mg/ATP ratios above 0.5. A unique chloroplast regulatory system, termed thiol modulation, involves reduction-oxidation of a disulfide bond (24Nalin C.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7275-7280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) formed between Cys199 and Cys205 in a region of its γC subunit that does not appear in any other F1-γ subunits (25Miki J. Maeda M. Mukohata Y. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). But there are as yet no assembled CF1-α3β3γ or similar photosynthetic complexes that can be engineered for studies aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanism of their regulatory systems and the possible ATPase-induced rotation of their γ subunit. In this investigation, we have used our earlier developed procedure for refolding and assembly of the αR and βRsubunits of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum into αR1βR1 dimers (26Du Z. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) to follow their further association into αR3βR3 hexamers, and with the recombinant chloroplast γC (11Sokolov M. Lu L. Tucker W. Gao F. Gegenheimer P.A. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13824-13829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), into hybrid αR3βR3γC-ATPases. Two types of such highly active hybrids were assembled, containing WT βR or the catalytic site mutant βR-T159S (27Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 901-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and both retained the specific γC redox regulation. These hybrid complexes provide the first photosynthetic F1assemblies that can be genetically engineered for probing rotational catalysis. Both hybrids show, besides a very high MgATPase also a CaATPase activity, that in the hybrid WT αR3βR3γCis much higher than the MgATPase activity but does not respond to any tested MgATPase effector. This hybrid WT complex thus supplies an additional interesting system for assaying rotation, which has been induced up to now (17Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K.J.

Gromet-Elhanan Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Recombinant γC was expressed and refolded as described by Sokolovet al. (11Sokolov M. Lu L. Tucker W. Gao F. Gegenheimer P.A. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13824-13829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). RrF1 was prepared from R. rubrum chromatophores according to Weiss et al. (30Weiss S. McCarty R.E. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest purity available. The dimers were assembled by refolding the urea-solubilized αR and βR together according to the procedure developed for their optimal refolding into functional monomers (26Du Z. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The refolded mixture was concentrated to about 1 mg/ml by Centriprep-10 (Amicon), precipitated with 60% saturated (NH4)2SO4, and resuspended in TGN buffer containing 50 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, and 50 mm NaCl. The remaining insoluble aggregates were removed by centrifugation, and the refolded mixture was loaded on the size-exclusion HPLC Superdex-200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 100 mm NaPi, pH 7.0, containing 10% glycerol at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The pooled α1β1 dimer peak was concentrated, transferred to TGN buffer by elution-centrifugation through Sephadex G-50 columns, and stored at −80 °C. The isolated αR1βR1 dimers could be fully converted into the αR3βR3 hexamers only when incubated, at >1 mg of protein/ml for 1 h at 22 °C, in TGN buffer containing also 10 mm NaF, and 0.5 mm AlCl3, in the presence of either 1 mm of CaCl2 or MgCl2 and 1 mm ATP or ADP (see Fig. 1 D). Their activities could therefore be assayed directly by diluting samples assembled in the presence of each cation and ADP into the same cation-ATPase assay mixtures. The hybrid WT αR3βR3γCwas assembled by two procedures as follows: 1) incubation of the isolated αR1βR1dimers with refolded γC for 1 h at 22 °C in TGN buffer in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2 or CaCl2 and 1 mm ADP which in this mixture, as in the hexamer assembly mixture, is as effective as ATP. Each incubated sample could therefore be assayed directly for its ATPase activity as well as size-exclusion HPLC. 2) Refolding the urea-solubilized recombinant αR and βR each at 50 μg/ml, together with urea-solubilized γC at 20 μg/ml, according to the procedure developed above for assembly of αR1βR1 dimers. The assembled hybrid complex was isolated by size-exclusion HPLC as described for the dimers, except that the hybrids were eluted with buffer containing 50 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The peak containing the hybrid complex was pooled, concentrated, exchanged into TGN buffer as described for the dimers, and stored at −80 °C. The hybrid mutant αR3(βR-T159S)3γCcomplex was assembled and isolated as described for the hybrid WT. The activities of RrF1 and both hybrid αR3βR3γCWT and mutant complexes were measured with 4–20 μg of protein for 5 min at 35 °C in 0.5 ml of an assay mixture containing 50 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm ATP, and 2 mm of either MgCl2 or MnCl2 or 4 mm CaCl2. The activities of the isolated αR1 βR1 dimers were measured with 30 μg of protein for 30 min under the conditions described above. To compare the ATPase activities of the αR3βR3 hexamers with those of RrF1, the hexamers were first assembled by incubating the dimers as described above, and RrF1 was incubated under identical conditions. The ATPase activities of this RrF1 and the freshly assembled αR3βR3 hexamers were measured by diluting each incubation mixture into the relevant assay mixtures, which also contained 10 mm NaF and 0.5 mm AlCl3. All ATPase activity assays were started by adding the protein complexes and stopped by adding 50 μl of 2 m trichloroacetic acid, and the released Pi was measured as described by Taussky and Shorr (31Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of reduction or oxidation on the ATPase activities of RrF1 and the hybrid complexes was tested by their preincubation for 1 h at 35 °C in TGN buffer containing either 10 mm DTT or 100 μm CuCl2, followed by dilution into the relevant assay mixtures. SDS-PAGE was carried out on the Novex Pre-Cast 10–20% Tris glycine gradient gels. The protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (32Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar) or according to Lowry et al. (33Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Active dimers, but no hexamers, have been assembled by incubation of the isolated αR and βRmonomers for 5 min at 35 °C in the presence of MgATP (26Du Z. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These dimers showed a maximal MgATPase rate of 0.14 units/mg of protein, which remained linear for at least 1 h at 35 °C. In search for conditions that might enable the assembly of αR3βR3 hexamers, the urea-solubilized αR and βR subunits (26Du Z. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) were refolded together as described under “Experimental Procedures.” They did indeed assemble directly, but again only into αR1βR1 dimers with no indication for the appearance of any larger complexes (Fig.1 A). This simple one-step refolding/assembly procedure enabled the isolation of large amounts of the pooled concentrated dimer peak, which remained very stable in TGN buffer at protein concentrations above 1 mg/ml, even when incubated for 1 h at 22 °C (Fig. 1 B). However, when diluted to the 10–20-fold lower protein concentrations used for ATPase activity assays, they remained stable only in presence of either MgADP or MgATP or even CaAD(T)P (not shown). The closed α3β3 hexamer, resolved in the x-ray crystallographic structure of bovine mitochondrial MF1 (12Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

The isolated αR1βR1 dimers could therefore have either one of these interfaces. But the fact that their MgATPase activity (26Du Z. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) is similar to that of CF1-α3β3 (10Gao F. Lipscomb B. Wu I. Richter M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9763-9769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 34Gromet-Elhanan Z. Sokolov M. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 46: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) indicates that these dimers contain the catalytic nucleotide-binding site at their α/β interface. Their inability to associate into an αR3βR3 hexamer therefore seems to reflect a very specific lower stability of the noncatalytic RrF1 α/β interfaces. Indeed from theR. rubrum chromatophore-bound RrF0F1, only native dimers have been isolated (35Andralojc P.J. Harris D.A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). From chloroplast, on the other hand, only unstable αC3βC3 hexamers could be obtained, and they readily dissociated into mixtures of their respective α and β monomers (10Gao F. Lipscomb B. Wu I. Richter M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9763-9769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36Sokolov M. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1242-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A search for compounds or conditions that can stabilize the noncatalytic RrF1 α/β interfaces and enable the association of the αR1βR1 dimers into hexamers has yielded the results demonstrated in Fig. 1, Cand D. Incubation of the concentrated stable dimers (Fig.1 B) with NaF and AlCl3 that form aluminum fluoride (AlFx), 2The exact species of aluminum fluoride in the incubated mixture of AlCl3 and NaF that exerts the stabilizing effect on the noncatalytic RrF1 α/β interfaces is as yet unknown. We therefore refer to it here as AlFx. a transition state analog of F1 nucleotide-binding sites (37Lunardi J. Dupuis A. Garin J. Issartel J.P. Michel L. Chabre M. Vignais P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7052-7058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), resulted in their partial conversion into the closed αR3βR3 hexamers (Fig. 1 C). Full association of these dimers into hexamers was obtained by their incubation with both NaF and AlCl3 in the presence of either Mg2+ or Ca2+ and either ADP or ATP at a cation/nucleotide ratio of 1 (Fig. 1 D). AlFx was reported earlier to inhibit various F1-MgATPases but only after their very specific stepwise preincubation first with low ADP and high MgCl2concentrations, then with NaF, and finally with AlCl3. The structure of bovine MF1, fully inhibited by this procedure, has recently been resolved (41Braig K. Menz R.I. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Structure. 2000; 6: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It shows that both aluminum trifluoride and Mg2+-ADP were bound, in a quasi-irreversible manner, to the catalytic nucleotide-binding site of the MF1-βDP subunit. However, under our very different one-step incubation conditions, which associated practically all the αR1βR1dimers into αR3βR3hexamers (compare Fig. 1, B and D), the RrF1-MgATPase activity was hardly affected by AlFx(see Fig. 5). Furthermore, these αR3βR3 hexamers remained fully stable only in the presence of AlFx and Mg- or CaAD(T)P at cation/AD(T)P ratios of 1 (Fig. 1, E andF). So under our association conditions AlFx does not bind irreversibly to the catalytic α/β interface of the dimers and does not inhibit their MgATPase activity. It rather seems to bind in a reversible manner to the open noncatalytic nucleotide-binding site on the dimer αR subunit and facilitate its association with the βR of another dimer, leading to their assembly into the closed hexameric structure. Incubation of the αR1βR1 dimers with an F1-γ subunit instead of AlFx resulted in their assembly into a stable, highly active α3β3γ complex (Fig.2). A recombinant CF1-γC subunit was used for these studies since there is as yet no available native or recombinant γR. This γC was found to assemble with the native unstable CF1-αC3βC3into a stable highly active αC3βC3γCcomplex (11Sokolov M. Lu L. Tucker W. Gao F. Gegenheimer P.A. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13824-13829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and its incubation with the isolated αR1βR1 dimers resulted in their assembly into a hybrid αR3βR3γC(Fig. 2, A and B). This assembly could also be followed by the dramatic 100-fold increase (Fig.3) of the low 0.1–0.15 units/mg MgATPase activity of the αR1βR1 dimers (26Du Z. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). But unlike the fast assembly of the αR and βR monomers into dimers, which reached their maximal MgATPase activity after a 5-min incubation at 22 °C (26Du Z. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), this assembly was slow, requiring about 60 min for completion. A very similar time dependence was reported for the assembly of a CF1-(αβγ)-complex from isolated native CF1-(αβ) and a CF1-γC (10Gao F. Lipscomb B. Wu I. Richter M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9763-9769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The increase in activity during the αR3βR3γCassembly was also fully dependent on the amount of γC, saturating at a molar ratio of 2 γC/α1β1 (Fig. 3,inset). The relatively high amount of γCrequired for obtaining this saturated activity was due to the tendency of both native and refolded γC to aggregate, since they remained soluble only when stored in a buffer containing 0.3m LiCl at pH 9.5 (10Gao F. Lipscomb B. Wu I. Richter M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9763-9769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Sokolov M. Lu L. Tucker W. Gao F. Gegenheimer P.A. Richter M.L.

So when γC was diluted into the incubation buffer with the αR1βR1, it partially precipitated out during their slow assembly into the hybrid αR3βR3γCcomplex. The time- and γC-dependent increase in the MgATPase activity during the assembly is therefore presented in units/mg αβ (Fig. 3).Figure 3Time-dependent assembly of a highly active hybrid αR3βR3γC-ATPase complex. 4.6 μg of the isolated αR1βR1 dimers and 2.5 μg of a refolded γC were incubated at 22 °C in 50 μl of TGN buffer with 1 mm MgADP.

Photosystem II is a pigment-protein complex of the thylakoid membrane of higher plants, eukaryotic algae, and cyanobacteria. It catalyzes light-induced electron transfer from water to plastoquinone, with associated production of molecular oxygen.

A number of extrinsic proteins are also associated with it at the membrane surface. The entire set of electron transfer cofactors, including chlorophyll a, pheophytina, plastoquinones, and non-heme iron, is associated with the D1/D2 heterodimer. These two proteins, together with the α and β subunits of cytochrome b559 and the PsbI protein, constitute the so-called reaction center II (RCII), which is the smallest PSII subparticle still able to perform light-induced charge separation (1Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two large integral membrane proteins, CP43 and CP47, each coordinating a number (12Barbato R. Friso G.

Some of them are universal, whereas others are present only in cyanobacteria (PsbU and PsbV) or only in higher plants (e.g. PsbP, PsbQ, PsbS) (2Barber J. Nield J. Morris E.P. Zheleva D. Hankamer B. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 817-827Crossref Google Scholar).Investigation of the structural and functional roles of the various PSII subunits requires, as a preliminary step, a suitable method to detect them in the thylakoid membrane or purified subparticle preparations. The detection and study of stimuli-induced modifications of several PSII components have mainly been based on the use of polyclonal antibodies. However, these are often not available and, when available, are time-consuming to use.A different technique, capable of accurately detecting even small amounts of the various PSII subunits in an integrated system, could be of great help in studying the function of these proteins. Mass spectrometry has recently been used for structural biology studies, also in the field of photosynthesis. A reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification system has been developed for the separation of PSII reaction center proteins, and the molecular masses of the resulting purified, intact proteins have been determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (3Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3935-3943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J. Morris H.R. J. Biol.

These studies demonstrate that ESI-MS is indeed a useful technique for studying hydrophobic membrane proteins also. Whereas ESI-MS allows highly accurate measurement of the molecular mass, it suffers from the important limitation that it cannot be applied in the presence of detergents, and the proteins, free of salts and detergents prior to MS analysis, must be purified (7Barnidge D.R. Dratz E.A. Jesaitis A.J. Sunner J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 10: 1-9Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This paper reports the results obtained by MALDI mass spectrometry for rapid determination of non-purified proteins of photosynthetic complexes isolated from spinach and cyanobacteria.MATERIALS AND METHODSMALDI Mass SpectrometryMeasurements were performed on a REFLEX time-of-flight instrument (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a SCOUT ion source operating in positive linear mode. Ions, formed by a pulsed UV laser beam (nitrogen laser, λ = 337 nm), were accelerated to 25 kV. The use of this beam did not result in degradation of photosynthetic proteins during measurements. Sinapinic acid (saturated solution in acetonitrile:water (50:50 v:v)) was used as a matrix. Samples, at chlorophyll concentrations of 9–250 μg/ml, were diluted 2- to 10-fold with a 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid aqueous solution. 5 μl of the diluted sample solution was mixed with the same volume of matrix solution, and 1 μl of the resulting mixture was deposited on a stainless steel sample holder and allowed to dry before introduction into the mass spectrometer.Because of the wide mass range to be examined, two different instrumental conditions were used. For low molecular masses (2,000–20,000 Da), pulsed ion extraction was carried out applying a voltage of 22.3 kV for 300 ns to the second grid. External mass calibration was carried out using [M + H]+ ions of bovine insulin and horse myoglobin at m/z 5734 and 16952, respectively, and the corresponding doubly charged species atm/z 2868 and 8476, respectively. For high molecular masses (20,000–80,000 Da), pulsed ion extraction was used applying a voltage of 21.9 kV for 400 ns to the second grid. External mass calibration was carried out using [M + H]+ ions of horse myoglobin and bovine serum albumin at m/z16952 and 66431, respectively, and the doubly charged species of bovine serum albumin at m/z 33216. The GuessProt algorithm was used to determine the predicted molecular masses of the PSII subunits.Preparation of PSII Particles and Isolated RCII from SpinachPSII core complexes from spinach were prepared according to Ghanotakis et al. (8Ghanotakis D.F. Demetriou D.M. Yocum C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 15-21Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and isolation of RCII was performed as described in Ref. 9Chapman D.J.

(10Mayes S.R. Dubbs J.M. Vass I. Hideg E. Nagy L. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1454-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured as previously described (11Barbato R. Polverino de Laureto P. Rigoni F. De Martini E. Giacometti G.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), harvested by centrifugation (2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), and resuspended in a breaking buffer containing the following: 20 mm Mes, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm aminocaproic acid, and 25% glycerol (pH 6.35 with NaOH). Cells were broken on ice using a bead beater (Biospec) by application of 15 30-s cycles at 5-min intervals. Unbroken cells were eliminated (5-min centrifugation at 2000 × g), and thylakoids were pelleted at 140,000 × g for 30 min. Pellets were then resuspended in 50 mm Mes and 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate (pH 6.5). Isolated thylakoids were solubilized with 2% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside for 30 min and loaded on a continuous sucrose gradient containing 25 mm Mes, 0.5 m sucrose, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.03% dodecyl maltoside (pH 6.5). Three bands, i.e. carotenoids, cytochrome b6/f, and PSII, separated out after 17 h of centrifugation at 35,000 rpm. The PSII band was collected and concentrated in Centricon-100 tubes.Preparation of RC47 from SynechocystisRC47 particles, containing the PSII reaction center (RCII) and the chlorophylla internal antenna CP47 but lacking the other chlorophylla internal antenna, CP43, were prepared from PSI-lessSynechocystis following the procedure described in Szabò et al. 2I. Szabò, F. Rigoni, M. Bianchetti, D. Carbonera, F. Pierantoni, R. Seraglia, and G. M. Giacometti, Submitted for publication. Briefly, thylakoid membranes from a PSI-less mutant strain ofSynechocystis were solubilized in 10% dodecyl maltoside for 30 min, subjected to anion exchange chromatography, and eluted with a linear 0–200 mm gradient of MgSO4. The elution profile comprised a single peak for RC47 at about 110 mmMgSo4.SDS-PAGESDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of urea (6 m) was performed as described previously (12Barbato R. Friso G. Giardi M.T. Rigoni F. Giacometti G.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10220-10226Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Irradiation ConditionsPSII samples at 90 μg/ml chlorophyll were irradiated in a cuvette with a 1-cm light path using a visible light intensity of 700 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 and a UV-B light intensity of 5 μmol of photons m−2s−1. A Vilbert-Lourmat 215M lamp was used as a UV-B source, wrapped in cellulose diacetate foil (0.15 mm thick) to screen out any UV-C component emitted by the UV-B source.RESULTSPSII Core and RCII Complexes from SpinachThe representative MALDI spectrum of a PSII core complex from spinach in the low molecular mass range (3000–6000 Da) is shown in Fig.1 A. At least 11 peaks are detected, and some of them, identifiable as known PSII subunits, are listed in Table I. It is well known that PSII core complexes of higher plants contain several low molecular weight polypeptides, as demonstrated by analysis of the plastidial genome (13Douglas S.E. Curr. Opin. Genet.

As may be seen, MALDI data on subunit composition and MW values in intact spinach PSII cores and RCII complexes closely match those obtained by Morris and co-workers (3Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J.

However, in the case of RCII in the low molecular mass region, we clearly detected an additional peak atm/z 5928, assigned to the PsbW protein. Accordingly, this protein has recently been suggested (15Irrgang K.D. Shi L.X. Funk C. Schroeder W.P. J. Biol.

PsbW has been detected by ESI-MS only in spinach RC47 (6Zheleva D. Sharma J. Panico M. Morris H.R. Barber J. J. Biol.

In the high molecular mass region, as expected for RCII, two main peaks are clear at m/z 37,998 and 39,379, attributed to D1 and D2 proteins, respectively (Fig.1 C).Altogether, these results show that, in particular in the low molecular mass range, direct measurements on PSII and RCII preparations are quite accurate and that MW values are comparable with those of isolated proteins obtained by ESI-MS.PSII Core Complexes from CyanobacteriaStudy of the structural-functional role of the subunit components of supramolecular complexes has been greatly advanced by the development of molecular genetic techniques such as the generation of mutants carrying site-specific modifications or gene deletions. In this respect, the identification of an easily transformable photosynthetic organism, with high frequency of homologous recombination, able to survive and propagate without functional photosystems, has been of great help. The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 fulfils these requirements, and, moreover, its whole genome has been sequenced. However, preparation of purified PSII subparticles and their isolated polypeptide components is even more difficult from cyanobacteria than from higher plants. A method to reveal and identify PSII components in cyanobacteria quickly, with no need for extended, time-consuming purification, would be useful, and it was for this reason that we focused our attention on Synechocystis.PSII cores were isolated from a PSI-less mutant cyanobacterium. Part of the psaAB operon coding for the core complex of PSI was deleted from the genome of Synechocystis wild-type strain (16Shen G. Boussiba S. Weermas W.F.J. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). PSI-less cells have approximately six times more PSII than do wild-type cells, as estimated on a chlorophyll basis. The MALDI spectra of Fig. 3 were obtained from two different preparations. In the 20,000–70,000 m/zrange, seven main peaks were detected at m/z55276 ± 424, 51470 ± 9, 39268 ± 37, 38049 ± 17, 34399 ± 9, 31030 ± 7, and 25750 ± 9 (n = 16 spectra from 8 different preparations). Each MALDI measurement was highly reproducible for the same sample, and good reproducibility was observed in the m/z values of the peaks for samples deriving from different preparations (compareA and B of Fig. 3). However, the relative intensity of the peaks depended on sample preparation, due to the presence of varying amounts of interfering materials, such as salts and lipids (17Xiang F. Beavis R.C. Org. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 28: 1424-1428Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Figure 3MALDI spectra of two distinct preparations of PSII core complex from Synechocystis. m/z values are indicated in A; assignment of the main peaks is shown in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Molecular weight values obtained by MALDI were compared with protein masses calculated from the nucleotide sequences of PSII components. Good correlations between calculated and measured values revealed the following correspondence between measured m/zvalues and known PSII components: 55,276 m/z, CP47 (molecular mass of unprocessed precursor, 55,902 Da); 51,470 m/z, CP43 (molecular mass of unprocessed precursor, 51,760 Da); 39,268 m/z, D2; 38,049m/z, D1 (Fig. 3 B). It is worth noting that the two latter values are very close to those ascribed to the predominant form of D2 and D1 purified from pea by reverse phase HPLC and detected by ESI-MS (see above). Concerning the other peaks detectable in the spectra of Fig. 3, that at m/z25,750 may correspond to the doubly charged species of the ion atm/z 51,470. The peaks atm/z 31,030 and 34,399 may represent subunits of ATP synthase (predicted masses of 30,698 and 34,605 Da, respectively). Alternatively, the peak at m/z 31,030 may correspond to the phycobilisome 32-kDa linker peptide (predicted mass of 30,797 Da). Clear-cut identification of these peaks would require the use of mutants lacking these proteins.It is worth noting that the m/z peaks assigned to the apoproteins of the two internal antennae, CP43 (m/z 51,460) and CP47 (m/z55,276), are reproducibly very different in their amplitude, despite the fact that both components have a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio to the reaction center. This may be related to the different ionization probability of the two subunits when embedded in the PSII core complex. It might be speculated that CP43, which is less closely associated with the core and is located in a more external position with respect to CP47 (18Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), offers a higher cross-section for ionization to incoming laser photons. To confirm unequivocally the assignment of them/z peaks to the internal antennae, we prepared an RC47 particle from the Synechocystis PSII core. This PSII subparticle, obtained by dissociating the CP43 subunit by partial detergent solubilization, is the cyanobacterial analogue of the RC47 obtained from higher plants by other groups (6Zheleva D. Sharma J. Panico M. Morris H.R. Barber J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16122-16127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). An immunoblot of its polypeptide components is shown in Fig.4 C. Whereas the D1, D2, and CP47 subunits of the PSII core are left unchanged in the RC47 particle (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2, 4, and8), only a tiny amount of CP43 is contained in the latter (lane 6). If the proposed assignments are correct, we expect the m/z peak at 51,470 to disappear from the MALDI spectrum of the RC47 particle. Fig. 4 compares the spectrum of RC47 (B) with that of the core complex (A). The expectation is fully matched, because the m/zpeak at 51,470 is highly reduced with respect to the intensity of the D1 and D2 peaks. It may be noted that the peak at 55,276, attributed to CP47, maintains approximately the same relative intensity. Therefore, an eventual shadowing action on CP47 must be exerted by core proteins other than CP43, in accordance with the recent finding that the two internal antennae are on opposite sites of the D1-D2 heterodimer, rather than sequentially located within the PSII core (20Hankamer B. Morris E.P. Barber J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It may also be noted that detergent treatment on sample A to produce RC47 (Fig.4 B) also eliminates the impurities giving rise tom/z peaks in the range of 25–35 kDa.Figure 4MALDI spectra of PSII core complexes (A) and RC47 subparticle (B) fromSynechocystis.

The usual way to reveal these phenomena is to measure the D1 and D2 contents of the thylakoid membrane after exposure to radiation by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting and then to search for the generated fragments by the same methods. The following experiment aimed at checking whether the MALDI technique could be used as an alternative, direct method to study the phenomenon. Fig.5 shows an example of this application. PSII isolated from PSI-less organisms was left untreated (Fig. 5 A) or was irradiated with visible light (B) or UV-B light (C) for 30 min. The intensity of each peak was measured in the three samples deriving from the same preparation and expressed as a percentage of the intensity of the CP43 peak (m/z 51,470), which is known to be unaffected by the light intensities used here (30Rajagopal S. Murthy S.D. Mohanty P. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 2000; 54: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Whereas the relative intensities of most of the peaks did not change upon exposure to radiation, those corresponding to D1 and D2 (m/z 38,048 and 39,268, respectively) showed marked variations. In particular, the intensities of the D1 peak decreased by 63% in visible light-illuminated PSII and by 13% in the UV-B-treated sample. The intensities of the D2 peak decreased by 45 and 35%, respectively. It is worth stressing the point that the three spectra (Fig. 5, A–C) were obtained from aliquots of the same sample, thus ensuring that evaluation of the peak areas was accurate enough to make quantitative comparisons significant. An unidentified peak at m/z 31,071 was also found to be slightly affected by both kinds of irradiation, suggesting that this protein is involved in the stress response.Figure 5MALDI spectra of PSII core complexes fromSynechocystis: untreated sample (A) and samples irradiated with visible (B) and UV-B light (C).

https://openalex.org/W1593099718,"The effects of pH and temperature on the stability of interdomain interactions of colicin B have been studied by differential-scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The calorimetric properties were compared with those of the isolated pore-forming fragment. The unfolding profile of the full-length toxin is consistent with two endothermic transitions. Whereas peak A (Tm = 55 °C) most likely corresponds to the receptor/translocation domain, peak B (Tm = 59 °C) is associated with the pore-forming domain. By lowering the pH from 7 to 3.5, the transition temperature of peaks A and B are reduced by 25 and 18 °C, respectively, due to proton exchange upon denaturation. The isolated pore-forming fragment unfolds at much higher temperatures (Tm = 65 °C) and is stable throughout a wide pH range, indicating that intramolecular interactions between the different colicin B domains result in a less stable protein conformation. In aqueous solution circular dichroism spectra have been used to estimate the content of helical secondary structure of colicin B (≈40%) or its pore-forming fragment (≈80%). Upon heating, the ellipticities at 222 nm strongly decrease at the transition temperature. In the presence of lipid vesicles the differential-scanning calorimetry profiles of the pore-forming fragment exhibit a low heat of transition multicomponent structure. The heat of transition of membrane-associated colicin B (Tm= 54 °C at pH 3.5) is reduced and its secondary structure is conserved even at intermediate temperatures indicating incomplete unfolding due to strong protein-lipid interactions.

The heat of transition of membrane-associated colicin B (Tm= 54 °C at pH 3.5) is reduced and its secondary structure is conserved even at intermediate temperatures indicating incomplete unfolding due to strong protein-lipid interactions. Membrane proteins are characterized by water-exposed extramembranous as well as intramembranous regions, which are embedded in the interior of the lipid bilayer. As a consequence, the energetics of stabilization of membrane-inserted proteins is expected to include contributions from these two regions in different proportions. Whereas the extramembranous region is more likely to be organized by forces similar to those described for water-soluble proteins (1Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein. Chem. 1982; 35: 1-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 2Murphy K.P. Bhakuni V. Xie D. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the membrane-inserted regions are very stable because of considerable strengthening of hydrogen-bonding interactions within the lipidic milieu (3Engelmann D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Ann. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). The transition of proteins from a soluble to a membrane-associated state offers a new challenge for describing the energetics involved in the process of membrane insertion, which are critical for the proper folding of membrane proteins (3Engelmann D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Ann. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 4White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). A key aspect in lipid-protein interactions is the partitioning of the protein from water into the membrane. The conformational changes, however, that are associated with protein insertion into, transport across, and maintenance within membranes remain poorly understood. Pore-forming colicins are water-soluble proteins that insert into membranes. Merely by offering a different environment and without the need of chemical modifications, these proteins can be investigated as well in solution as in their membrane-inserted state. Therefore, they provide excellent model systems to study the structural changes during membrane insertion. Pore-forming colicins (e.g. colicin A, B, N, E1, and Ia) invade Escherichia coli cells by parasitizing receptors of the outer membrane and use the Tol or Ton protein complexes for translocation. In a final step these proteins cause voltage-dependent pore formation. The three functions correlate with three distinct domains of the polypeptide chain, which are arranged along the primary sequence in the following order: translocation, receptor recognition, and channel formation. Here we study colicin B (ColB),1 which is a 54.6-kDa protein secreted by Escherichia coli as a monomeric unit. Primary overall sequence comparison and functional studies indicate that ColB is most closely related to colicins A, N, and Ia (5Gouaux E. Structure. 1997; 5: 313-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6Lazdunski C.J. Bouveret E. Rigal A. Journet L. Lloubes R. Benedetti H. J.

It has been suggested that, after binding to the target cell but before insertion occurs, the colicin pore-forming domains undergo conformational changes to adopt an insertion-competent state. This transition is induced in vitro by acidic pH. Membrane-active colicins thereby exhibit close similarity to other proteins such as diphtheria, tetanus, and botulinum toxins (8Parker M.W. Tucker A.D. Tsernoglou D. Pattus F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 126-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Previous calorimetric studies have contributed some understanding of the structural transitions of the colicin A and colicin E1 pore-forming domains (9Muga A. Gonzalez-Manas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1553-1557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Zakharov S.D. Lindeberg M. Griko Y. Salamon Z. Tollin G. Prendergast F.G. Cramer W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4282-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the conformational changes of full-length colicin B or its thermolytic fragments, which are necessary for membrane binding and insertion, have so far not been characterized. Macromolecules are stabilized by the cooperative action of numerous weak forces. Because such highly cooperative structures undergo phase transition-like conformational changes upon exposure to heat, relevant thermodynamic, and structural information is obtained from differential-scanning calorimetry (DSC) and circular dichroism (CD) studies. Unlike the many calorimetric studies conducted with water-soluble proteins, the stability of only a few membrane proteins has been measured calorimetrically, and even less is known about the thermal stability of proteins that insert into membranes (9Muga A.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12862-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Investigations of full-length colicin B as well as its C-terminal fragment both in solution and the membrane-associated state allows for a direct comparison of the thermal characteristics in these different environments. In addition, by investigating the pH-dependent properties of full-length colicin and its pore-forming fragment, important information on the domain structure and inter-domain interactions is obtained (1Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein. Chem. 1982; 35: 1-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). The observed modulations of thermal stability by interactions between domains and with the membrane have important implications also for the insertion and translocation competence of colicin B. ColB was expressed inE. coli. The full-length protein as well as its thermolytic fragment were purified following procedures described elsewhere (15Pressler U. Braun V. Wittmann-Liebold B. Benz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2654-2659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Lambotte S. Jasperse P. Bechinger B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This latter domain of the homologous colicin A protein has been shown to exhibit pore-forming activities (e.g. Ref. 17Baty D. Knibiehler M. Verheij H. Pattus F. Shire D. Bernadac A. Lazdunski C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1152-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the thermolytic fragment is, therefore, abbreviated PFF. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of ColB and its pore-forming fragment shows one single band in Coomassie Blue-stained gels. All phospholipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL) and used without further purification. Small unilamellar vesicles of POPC:cardiolipin:POPE (5:1:2, w/w) were prepared from a homogeneous solution of the three lipids in chloroform/methanol (1:1). The solvent was completely removed with a stream of nitrogen and by exposure to high vacuum overnight. Thereafter, buffer was added and the suspension was subjected to several freeze-thaw cycles. A clear suspension of small unilamellar vesicles was obtained after repeated extrusion first through 100-nm (5 times) and thereafter 50 nm polycarbonate filters (Avestin, Milsch, Laudenbach, Germany). The lipid concentration for DSC, CD, and fluorescence experiments was 50 mg/ml. DSC was used to measure the transition temperatures (Tm) of full-length ColB and its pore-forming fragment. Tm is defined as the temperature at which the excess heat capacity is maximal. Lyophilized protein was dissolved in buffer (0.1 m KCl, 0.02 m glycine at pH 3.5–4.5; or 0.1 m KCl, 0.02 m tris-malate at pH 6.0–7.0), followed by dialysis overnight against the same buffer. Excess heat (Cp)versus temperature scans were obtained from 37 μm protein solutions using a high sensitivity differential scanning calorimeter MicroCal VP-DSC. The sample and reference solutions were carefully degassed under vacuum for 5 min before loading the cells (0.56 ml). After equilibration of the system at 10 °C, the temperature was increased to 100 °C and decreased to 10 °C at scan rates of 1 °C/min. Thereafter another 10–100 °C scan was obtained. This rescan, which in all cases showed no evidence of reversibility, was subtracted from the initial scan, and the resulting baseline was corrected. CD spectra (190–250 nm) were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter using a quartz cuvette of 0.1-mm path length. The protein concentration was 3 μm. For temperature scans at 222 nm, a heating rate of 1 °C/min was used (20–85 °C). CD spectra were recorded every 5–10 °C in the temperature range 20–80 °C as indicated in the figures. The helicity of the peptides was determined quantitatively only for spectra recorded at 25 °C, because limited protein aggregation was observed above the transition temperatures. All measurements were corrected for buffer contributions. The lipid concentration was kept constant. All emission fluorescence experiments were performed using a PerkinElmer LS-50 luminescence spectrometer with a water-thermostat cell holder. Excitation wavelengths of 290 nm were used, and the emission spectra were recorded within the range 300–500 nm. The temperature dependence of the fluorescence intensity was recorded at a constant heating rate of 1 °C/min from 25–85 °C at 320 nm. The protein concentration of ColB or its pore-forming fragment was 3 μm. To test for the effect of pH on the thermal stability of ColB and its pore-forming fragment in solution as well as in the presence of lipids, the proteins were investigated in a temperature-dependent manner by DSC, fluorescence, and CD spectroscopy. The temperature dependencies of the excess molar heat capacity of the full-length ColB between 10 and 100 °C are shown in Fig.1 as a function of pH. The scans were obtained at heating rates of 1 °C/min. Denaturation was irreversible, because the transitions are absent during cooling or reheating of the samples. In this study the “heat of transition,”ΔH, therefore, relates to the heat absorbed during the process of denaturation and cannot be fully interpreted as the enthalpy of a reversible process. 2In equilibrium processes the area under the transition endotherms (Cp versus temperature) represents the change of enthalpy of systems at thermodynamic equilibrium throughout the temperature-induced unfolding process (48Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Mateo P.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the literature reference is often made to “transition enthalpies” also in cases of irreversible protein denaturation during the heating scan (e.g. Refs. 9Muga A. Gonzalez-Manas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1553-1557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Butko P. Hunag F. Puztai-Carey M. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12862-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One of the reviewers pointed out that this approach might only be valid under some circumstances. Although the excellent line fit obtained during the deconvolution of our traces seems to suggest that application of a reversible model bears some justification (Figs. 1D, 3, 4) we prefer to make reference to “heat of transition” (ΔH) throughout the text. Two superimposed endothermic transitions give the best theoretical fit of the scans obtained at pH 7.0: peak A with Tm = 54.9 ± 0.5 °C, 3Compare Tables 1–3 for standard deviations of transition temperatures. and peak B with Tm = 58.7 ± 0.8 °C (n = 3) (ΔTm(B-A) =3.9 °C). At pH 3.5 both transitions occur at lower temperatures and with better resolution. The transition temperature of peak A is 29.8 °C and that of peak B 40.9 °C (ΔT(B-A) = 11.1 °C). The highest Tm was observed at pH values of >4.5. When the pH is decreased in a stepwise manner from 7.0 to 3.5, peaks A and B decrease by 25.0 °C and 17.8 °C, respectively. Therefore, although both components are affected by pH, peak B is less sensitive to changes in proton activity and more resistant to thermal denaturation than peak A. The transition temperatures obtained at pH 2.5 and pH 9.0 are very similar to those of pH 3.5 and pH 7.5, respectively (not shown). The heat absorbed during unfolding is obtained by integrating the area under the fitted curves of each transition. TableI lists the unfolding parameters determined using linear and quadratic baselines in a multiple-curve fitting routine of the DSC data. The calculatedΔH, for peaks A and B at different pH are included in Table I. The pH dependence of ΔHfor peak A and B is depicted in Fig. 2. Although ΔHA increases,ΔHB decreases at the same rate. The observation of two well-distinguishable transitions could be due to different protein conformations or due to separate conformational unfolding steps of discrete domains within the same protein. To further discriminate between these possibilities, ColB was heated to 35 °C, slightly above the Tm of peak A at pH 3.5, and was kept at this temperature for 10 min. A DSC experiment with partially unfolded ColB was then performed at a heating rate of 1 °C/min between 25 and 85 °C (Fig.3). A single transition withΔH = 98 kcal/mol andTm = 62.1 ± 0.1 °C (S.D.,n = 3) was observed, which is 21 °C increased fromTmB of the continuous scan. This result indicates that the transition of peak B is subject to interactions with components contributing to peak A.Table ICalorimetric data of ColB in aqueous solution at 1 °C/minpHTmAΔHATmBΔHBTotalΔH°Ckcal/mol°Ckcal/mol7.054.9 ± 0.516258.7 ± 0.8281906.555.5 ± NA1-aNA, not available.16358.5 ± NA271906.052.4 ± 0.415757.3 ± 0.4311884.551.3 ± 0.314557.0 ± 0.5401854.043.2 ± 0.813252.5 ± 0.4471793.529.8 ± 2.012140.9 ± 1.075199All enthalpies are in kcal/mol.

The values for Tmare means ± S.D. (n = 3). To study the origin of the two transitions of ColB, a 203-amino acid C-terminal fragment of ColB that contains the pore-forming domain was also investigated. Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence of the excess molar heat capacity of the pore-forming fragment at different pH values at a heating rate of 1 °C/min. Irreversible denaturation was observed after heating to 100 °C. The denaturation profile of the pore-forming fragment in solution shows one main transition corresponding to 90% of the totalΔH. The transition temperature for the main transition is 65.7 ± 1.5 °C at pH 7.0. A minor transition withTm = 55.5 ± 1.5 °C is consistently present and corresponds to the remaining 10 ± 4% of the total heat of transition. The transition temperature of the pore-forming fragment is pH-independent between pH 3.5 and 9.0 (Fig. 4 and TableII). The pH-dependent changes in ΔH of the PFF and peak B of ColB exhibit comparable characteristics (Tables I and II). By changing the pH from 3.5 to 7.0 the relative decrements in ΔH are 63 and 59% for ColB peak B and the pore-forming fragment, respectively. A minor increase in heat of transition when the pH was lowered from 7 to 5 was observed for the related ColA PFF (Fig. 2 in Ref. 9Muga A. Gonzalez-Manas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1553-1557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of pH on ColB reveals more than one protonation state, suggesting the existence of several conformational states (Fig.5A). In contrast, between pH 3.5 and 7.0 both transitions of the PFF occur in a pH-independent manner (Fig. 5B).Table IICalorimetric data of the pore-forming fragment in aqueous solution at 1 °C/minpHTmAΔHATmBΔHB°Ckcal/mol°Ckcal/mol7.055.5 ± 1.5265.7 ± 1.5276.053.7 ± 0.8864.3 ± 1.0374.555.2 ± 0.2865.0 ± 0.2623.555.1 ± 1.3565.1 ± 0.966All enthalpies are in kcal/mol.

The values for Tmare means ± S.D. (n = 3). The denaturation profile of ColB in the presence of small unilamellar lipid vesicles is shown in Fig.6A. At pH 7.0 ColB exhibits the same two transitions observed during its unfolding in aqueous solution in agreement with weak membrane-association of the protein at neutral pH. The Tm values of peaks A and B are 55.4 ± 0.4 °C and 57.9 ± 0.4 °C, respectively. At pH 3.5, however, peak A exhibits a Tm of 53.3 ± 0.9 °C and peak B is absent (Fig. 6B). In the presence of lipids the total ΔH of ColB at pH 7.0 is 172 kcal/mol. At pH 3.5 ΔH equals 140 kcal/mol in the presence of lipids, a value similar to theΔH observed for peak A at pH 3.5 in aqueous buffer alone (Fig. 1D and Table I). However, in the presence of lipids this latter transition has shifted to higher temperatures by at least 20 °C (Fig. 6B). Fig. 6C shows the DSC profile of the pore-forming fragment in the presence of lipids. The transition occurs over a wide temperature range and ΔH is significantly decreased (Table III). After rescan subtraction and baseline correction line-fitting analysis reveals a pattern of multiple transitions at pH 7.0 or pH 3.5 (Figs. 6,C and D). The calculated values ofTm andΔHtotal are listed in TableIII.Table IIICalorimetric data of the pore-forming fragment in the presence of lipids at 1 °C/minpHTmATmBTmCTmDΔHtot°Ckcal/mol7.051.1 ± 0.254.9 ± 0.156.5 ± 0.258.5 ± 0.253.553.2 ± 0.355.0 ± 0.156.7 ± 0.058.8 ± 0.36All enthalpies are in kcal/mol.

Far UV-CD spectra of ColB and the pore-forming fragment in solution and in the presence of lipids at pH 7.0 display a maximum at 191 nm as well as minima at 208 and 222 nm (Figs. 7C, 7D, 8B, and 8C). The CD line shapes are, therefore, characteristic of a large proportion of α-helical secondary structures. When the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm is taken as an indicator, helix contents of 39 and 82% are obtained for ColB and its PFF, respectively, in aqueous solution before starting the heating scan (Figs. 7C and 8B). In the presence of liposomes optical distortions by absorption flattening and light scattering would result in an underestimation of the helical content (18Wallace B.A. Moa B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These effects are minimized when small unilamellar vesicles prepared by extrusion through 50-nm filters are used (18Wallace B.A. Moa B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, no attempt was made to calculate the helix content quantitatively from the CD spectral line shape in the presence of lipids or after thermal denaturation. The relative intensity changes of the ellipticity at 222 nm, however, were recorded as a function of temperature and compared with the DSC thermal transitions (Fig. 7, A and B). Fig.7A presents the temperature dependence of the ColB ellipticity at 222 nm. At temperature scan rates of 1 °C/min (25–85 °C) a single transition is observed for ColB at pH 7.0 withTm values of 56.4 °C and 54.6 °C in the absence or presence of lipids, respectively (Fig. 7A). In both experiments the ellipticity at 222 nm of ColB sharply decreases. The corresponding full-wavelength scans (195–255 nm) are shown in Fig.7 (C and D). Fig. 7B shows the temperature dependence of the 222-nm intensity of the far UV-CD spectra of ColB at pH 3.5 in both aqueous solution and in the presence of lipids. Transitions are observed atTm values of 39.5 °C and 55.2 °C, respectively. However, the maximal level of unfolding is reached at a slower rate when compared with ColB at neutral pH (Fig. 7, Aand B). The inset shows the derivatives of the experimental curves. Fig. 7 (E and F) corresponds to the full-wavelength scans for ColB in solution and in the presence of lipids, respectively, at different temperatures and at pH 3.5. The temperature dependence of the CD spectra of the pore-forming fragment in solution at pH 7.0 exhibits single transitions at 64.4 °C and 62.3 °C in the absence or in the presence of lipids, respectively (Fig. 8A). This former value is in good agreement with the transition temperature of 65.7 °C observed in DSC experiments. Although in the absence of lipids much of the helix contributions are lost at temperatures above Tm (Fig.8B), in the presence of lipids a high helix content of the pore-forming fragment is conserved even at elevated temperatures (Fig.8C). The inset in Fig. 8A shows the derivatives of the melting curves. The temperature dependence of the intrinsic emission fluorescence of ColB and its pore-forming fragment in solution was also tested at scanning rates of 1 °C/min from 25 to 85 °C. ColB contains eight tryptophan residues, five of which are located in the R/T domain. The temperature dependence of the tryptophan fluorescence of ColB at pH 7.0 reveals a nearly linear decrease in fluorescence intensity as a function of increasing temperature (not shown). However, the temperature-induced quenching also exhibits a sharp increase in intensity at around 50–55 °C, thereby matching Tm of ColB peak A. The curves obtained during cooling to 25 °C or during a second heating period did not show the stepwise increase in intensity. This is in agreement with the irreversible unfolding observed by DSC. In the presence of lipids, the same transition is observed. The tryptophans of the pore-forming fragments experience a temperature-induced quenching in fluorophore intensity in solution or in the presence of lipids. However, a stepwise change in fluorescence intensity is absent during the melting process (not shown). The high resolution x-ray structures of several channel-forming domains of colicins (A, N, E1, Ia) exhibit a 10-helix arrangement with 2 hydrophobic helices being surrounded by two layers of hydrophilic and amphipathic helices (19Parker M.W.

Nature. 1997; 385: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). These conformations, therefore, represent water-soluble forms of the proteins. The primary sequences of the C-terminal parts of colicins A and N exhibit ≥54% identity and 71 or 62% homology with ColB PFF, respectively. In addition, both the high resolution x-ray structure of ColA PFF (19Parker M.W. Postma J.P. Pattus F. Tucker A.D. Tsernoglou D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 639-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and the ColB PFF CD spectra (Fig. 8B) exhibit ≥75% α-helix contributions. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that the colicin A and B pore-forming domains adopt closely related structures. In contrast, the length and amino acid composition of the pore-forming regions of colicins A, B, and N exhibit considerable differences when compared with those of colicins Ia, Ib, and E1 (e.g. Ref.16Lambotte S. Jasperse P. Bechinger B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, these C-terminal fragments are assigned to different families. However, when the receptor and translocation mechanisms of colicins are compared with each other, the molecules group in a different manner. Although group A colicins (including colicin A and ColN) use the TolA system for translocation, group B colicins (including ColB and ColIa) parasitize the Ton B machinery (6Lazdunski C.J. Bouveret E. Rigal A. Journet L. Lloubes R. Benedetti H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4993-5002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this functional similarity between ColB and ColIa, the primary sequence homology is modest and the helix content of ColB (Fig. 7B) is considerably lower than that of colicin Ia, in particular when considering the R/T domains alone (22Wiener M. Freymann D. Ghosh P. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Structural details, such as the location of the Ton recognition sequence in ColIa (22Wiener M. Freymann D. Ghosh P. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), or the distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues within the pore-forming domains of colicins indicate that upon receptor-bind"

For most integrases, modifications of critical moieties in the major and minor grooves of these sequences decrease 3′-processing. However, for human immunodeficiency virus type-2 (HTLV-2) IN, the replacement of the guanine with 6-methylguanine or hypoxanthine not only reduced 3′-processing, but also promoted cleavage at a second site. This novel cleavage activity required an upstream ACA, unique to the HTLV-2 U5 end. 3′-Processing assays with additional isosteric modifications at Gua and filter binding experiments revealed that the mechanism of the second site cleavage differed among the major groove, minor groove, and mismatch modifications. Importantly, the decrease in 3′-processing activity noted with the minor groove and mismatch modifications were attributed to a decrease in binding. Major groove modifications, however, decreased the level of 3′-processing, but did not affect binding. This suggests that integrase binds the viral end through the minor groove, but relies on major groove contacts for 3′-processing. Several modifications were also examined in strand transfer and disintegration substrates. HTLV-2 IN showed reduced activity with strand transfer and disintegration substrates containing major groove, but not minor groove modifications. This suggests major groove interactions at guanine also provide an important role in these reactions. Retroviral integrases (INs) interact with termini of retroviral DNA in the conserved 5′-C(A/G)T.

Skalka A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 133-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar,2Whitcomb J.M. Hughes S.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 275-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Successful integration of the viral DNA by IN requires three distinct enzymatic events: 3′-processing, strand transfer, and gap repair (3Craigie R. Fujiwara T. Bushman F. Cell. 1990; 62: 829-837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 4Katz R.A. Merkel G. Kulkosky J. Leis J. Skalka A.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 87-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In the initial step of integration, IN catalyzes the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond between the phylogenetically conserved CA and the two or three terminal nucleotides from each 3′ end of the viral DNA. 3′-Processing of the newly synthesized viral DNA intermediate occurs in the cytoplasm (5Roth M.J. Schwartzberg P.L. Goff S.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 47-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The strand transfer reaction follows in the nucleus where IN uses the 3′-hydroxyl group of each viral end to catalyze a direct nucleophilic attack at staggered 5′-phosphates in the phosphodiester backbone of the host DNA (6Engelman A. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. Cell. 1991; 67: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). IN can also catalyze the reverse of strand transfer, termed disintegration (7Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Science. 1992; 255: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Each of these reactions has been characterized in vitrowith double-stranded oligonucleotide substrates that mimic the end of the viral DNA molecule (Fig. 1 A). The final step, gap repair, requires host cellular enzymes and perhaps IN to remove the unpaired nucleotides at the 5′ ends of the viral DNA and complete the filling-in and joining of the single-strand gaps between the viral and host DNA. Numerous studies support the contributions of the conserved CA as necessary for recognition and catalysis by IN (5Roth M.J. Schwartzberg P.L. Goff S.P.

In addition, IN relies on at least one additional nucleotide upstream of the CA to distinguish its substrate from non-cognate viral long terminal repeat ends. Although most INs have some level of activity with heterologous viral ends (13Balakrishnan M. Jonsson C.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IN shows an equal binding affinity to both nonspecific and specific (viral) DNA substrates (14Pemberton I.K. Buckle M. Buc H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1498-1506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15van Gent D.C. Elgersma Y. Bolk M.W.J. Vink C. Plasterk R.H.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and therefore, precise recognition of the CA may occur during catalysis. Previously we showed the conserved C(A/G)T, particularly at the guanine and adenine residues, share a common scaffold of molecular features which are recognized by HIV-1, HTLV-2, and Moloney murine leukemia virus INs during 3′-processing or dinucleotide cleavage (17Wang T. Balakrishnan M. Jonsson C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3624-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Isosteric nucleotide analogue substitutions in these positions suggested both major groove and minor groove interactions in this region with IN (17Wang T. Balakrishnan M. Jonsson C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3624-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For example, insertion of an amino group into the minor groove at the Ade or position 3 in the plus strand or its removal at Gua or position 4 in the minus strand decreases activity in each of these INs. In contrast, these INs tolerate the insertion of a methyl group into the major groove of their U5 substrates at positions 3 and 4 in the plus strand and position 3 in the minus strand. However, the introduction of a methyl group using the nucleotide analogueO 6-methylguanine (6-MeGua) at position 4 in the minus strand of the U5 substrate produces a dramatic decrease in the level of 3′-processing activity. In this work, we extended the use of analogue nucleotide substitutions at Gua at position 4 in the minus strand to characterize the essential components of viral DNA substrate recognition and catalysis by HTLV-2 IN. Clear distinctions were observed in the major and minor groove contacts required for 3′-processing, strand transfer, and disintegration. However, in the process of these studies, a novel second site cleavage activity was uncovered in the HTLV-2 U5, but not the U3 substrate. The cleavage followed an upstream ACA sequence unique to the HTLV-2 U5 substrate. Cleavage at the upstream site required the ACA sequence and a modification of the Gua at position 4. The level of the upstream cleavage activity at this site was modulated by the type of nucleotide substitutions or modifications and differed among the major groove, minor groove, and mismatch modifications. Our results support a model in which IN initiates binding of the viral end through the minor groove, but relies on major groove contacts for 3′-processing, strand transfer, and distintegration. Oligonucleotide sequences corresponding to the wild type (WT) U5 and/or U3 ends of the HTLV-2 genomes (Fig. 1 C) were used as substrates in enzymatic assays as described previously (17Wang T. Balakrishnan M. Jonsson C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3624-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide synthesis, introduction of 2′-deoxynucleoside phosphoramidite analogues, and high performance liquid chromatography purification of oligonucleotides were performed at Integrated DNA Technologies. Oligonucleotide size standards (8–32) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protected 2′-deoxynucleoside phosphoramidites were purchased from Glen Research. Oligonucleotides were further purified on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 DNA kinase (New England Biolabs), and hybridized to complementary strands as described previously (13Balakrishnan M. Jonsson C.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HTLV-2 IN was expressed inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified as hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins from the insoluble fraction as described previously (17Wang T. Balakrishnan M. Jonsson C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3624-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Balakrishnan M. Zastrow D. Jonsson C.B. Virology. 1996; 219: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For native preparation of HTLV-2 IN, cultures were prepared as previously described (17Wang T. Balakrishnan M. Jonsson C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3624-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with the following modifications in the cell lysis. Pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mmNaCl, 10 mm imidazole) supplemented with 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) and EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The resuspended pellet was incubated on ice for 30 min. Triton X-100 was added to a 1% (v/v) concentration and the resulting solution was homogenized by douncing. The viscous cell lysate was then cleared by sonication, 5 × 30 s with 1 min rest in between pulses on ice. Clearing of lysates and native His-Tag IN purifications were performed as described (17Wang T. Balakrishnan M. Jonsson C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3624-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211739) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad Micro-Assay. Reaction buffer for HTLV-2 IN contained 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.75 mm CHAPS, and 7.5 mm MnCl2. Reactions were assembled in reaction buffer with 1 pmol of substrate and 0.013 μg/μl HTLV-2 in a final volume of 15 μl at 37 °C for 1 h. Reactions were terminated by addition of 10 μl of loading dye (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.5% xylene cyanol). Reaction products were separated on 20% polyacrylamide denaturing gels, subjected to autoradiography or PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics). Products were quantified with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of product was calculated from a minimum of three separate trials for each experiment performed in duplicate or triplicate. U5 end substrates were purified,32P-labeled as described, and hybridized at a molar ratio of 1:1. Binding reactions were assembled on ice with 1.0 pmol of substrate and 10 nm to 2.1 μm HTLV-2 IN in reaction buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 7.5 mmMnCl2, and 0.75 mm CHAPS) in a final volume of 20 μl. The ratio of enzyme to substrate was varied from 1:5 to 40:1. Reactions were conducted at room temperature for 20 min for complex formation. Each reaction was slot blotted onto a nitrocellulose, washed with 200 μl of the reaction buffer without metal and detergent. The blot was air-dried, and exposed to a phosphorscreen. Reactions were quantified from PhosphorImager data as described above, and results quantified from a minimum of two experiments with duplicate data sets. Previously, we noted that the replacement of guanine (Gua) at position 4 in the minus strand of the U5 substrate with 6-MeGua (4/6-MG) or Hyp (4-Hyp) decrease 3′-processing activity as compared with wild type U5 end substrate for several INs, HTLV-2, Moloney murine leukemia virus, and HIV-1 (17Wang T. Balakrishnan M. Jonsson C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3624-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 6-MeGua and Hyp introduce changes in the major and minor groove, respectively (Fig.1 D). Further analysis of the HTLV-2 IN reactions catalyzed with these two substrates, 4-Hyp and 4/6-MG, revealed a novel pattern of cleavage (Fig.2, lanes 4 and 6) as compared with the wild type (WT) U5 end substrate (Fig. 2,lane 2). In each modified substrate, a novel cleavage site occurred 3′ to position 7 (Fig. 1 C), and, of interest, this site follows a second internal CA in the HTLV-2 U5 end substrate. A low amount of additional heterogenous cleavages were also noted adjacent to the major novel cleavage site. To further explore the mechanism involved in promoting cleavage at the internal site in the HTLV-2 U5 substrate, 6-MeGua was introduced in the minus strand at position 8 in addition to the original analogue substitution at position 4. It was expected that IN′s cleavage activity would be blocked at the conserved CA and the second internal CA. Surprisingly, we observed an additional distinct pattern of cleavage following catalysis with IN. Imprecise cleavage occurred at two sites in the substrate, following positions 5 and 9; both of which were 5′ to the conserved CA and the internal CA (Fig. 2, lane 8). A time course of this reaction revealed no relationship between the cleavage of these two sites; i.e. the two sites were cleaved independently. 2T. Wang and C. B. Jonsson, unpublished observations. The unique activities displayed by IN with the single and double modifications suggested that the effect of 6-MeGua may not cause a simple block in the hydrogen bonding between IN and Gua in the major groove as interpreted for other protein-DNA interactions (20Spratt T.E. Levy D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3354-3361Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that 6-MeGua may generate a change in the geometry or conformation of van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions at the ACA through a structural alteration in the G-C base pair that affects the manner in which IN recognizes, binds, and/or cleaves the DNA substrate. In the following, we first address whether the upstream CA or ACA was required for cleavage. To determine whether the ACA context was required for the observed internal cleavage activity, we examined HTLV-2 IN activity with the HTLV-2 U3 substrate and the U3 substrate with the 6-MeGua substituted opposite of the C in the conserved CA (U3–4/6-MG). The WT HTLV-2 U3 sequence was chosen because it does not have an internal CA at this position, although it does have a CA further upstream (Fig. 1 C). The expected dinucleotide cleavage pattern was observed with the unmodified, WT U3 end substrate (Fig. 3 A, lane 2), while the U3–4/6-MG substrate showed a 5-fold decrease in this product (Fig. 3 A, lane 4) as compared with the WT U3 substrate. Neither the WT U3 nor U3–4/6-MG substrates showed internal cleavage when incubated with HTLV-2 IN. Previously, we showed that the ACA sequence was important for recognition and 3′-processing of the U5 substrate by HTLV-2 IN by comparison with its activity on heterologous retroviral substrates from HIV-1, HTLV-1, and Moloney murine leukemia virus (13Balakrishnan M. Jonsson C.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that mutation of the U3 substrate sequence from 5′-GGT to 5′-ACA in positions 7, 8, and 9 coupled with the 6-MeGua substitution at position 4 in the terminal conserved C(A/G)T were required for cleavage of the ACA engineered into the U3 substrate. As predicted, the modified substrate, U3–4/6-MG-ACA, was processed by the HTLV-2 IN at the internal CA (Fig. 3 A, lane 6). These experiments support the hypothesis that the modifications created at position 4 in the minus strand were required for 3′-processing at the upstream ACA. The above results suggested that the ACA was necessary and sufficient for recognition and catalysis of the viral end substrates by HTLV-2 IN, and that such a sequence may be recognized internally in a non-U3 or U5 context. To determine whether the ACA was alone sufficient for 3′-processing, non-U3 or U5 endsubstrates (NUS) with ACA (3-ACA NUS) and without (NUS) were designed and tested (Fig. 1 C). 3′-Processing of the 3-ACA NUS was observed (Fig. 3 B, lane 7). A random substrate, included as a control (NUS), was recognized, but was processed at much lower level compared with WT (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 5 and 3). Three additional random substrates, 5-ACA NUS, 6-ACA NUS, and 7-ACA NUS (Fig. 1 B), were designed to test whether HTLV-2 IN could recognize and process the ACA when placed internally in a random substrate context. These substrates were examined in standard reactions along with the WT U5 end substrate (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). HTLV-2 IN mediated catalysis was noted in reactions in which the substrate, ACA-NUS, had ACA placed at positions 3 through 5 (Fig. 3 B, lane 7), positions 5 through 7 (Fig. 3 B, lane 9), or positions 6 through 8 (Fig.3 B, lane 11). These reactions produced products that were chiefly composed of internal cleavages 3′ to the internal ACA. Thus, the 3-ACA reaction produced an 18-mer, the 5-ACA reaction resulted in a 16-mer, and the 6-ACA reaction produced a 15-mer. NUS substrates that contained ACA at positions 7 through 9 were not 3′-processed by the HTLV-2 IN (Fig. 3 B, lane 13). This suggests that IN can only gain access to internal ACA sequences if they are placed within the first 6 bases of the 3′ end. Strand transfer was evident with both the 5-ACA NUS and 6-ACA NUS substrates (Fig. 3 B, lanes 9 and11). This serves as further confirmation that the HTLV-2 IN relies solely on the ACA for complete processing of these substrates. To explore whether a simple lack in the hydrogen bonding contact in the major groove in Gua at position 4 was promoting catalysis at the second site, three additional modifications were made. 6-Thio-Gua, 2-aminopurine (2-AP), or Cyt (Fig.1 D) were substituted for Gua in the U5 substrate (Fig.1 C). The 6-thio-Gua is a conservative substitution in that the sulfur atom of the thioketo group can act as a weak hydrogen bond acceptor, and unlike the 6-MeGua substitution, 6-thio-Gua maintains Watson-Crick base pairing with Cyt (21Bugg C.E. Thewalt U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 7441-7445Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Thewalt U. Bugg C.E. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 8892-8898Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the hydrogen bond length for N-H···S distance is about 0.4 Å greater than the N-H···O distance (21Bugg C.E. Thewalt U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 7441-7445Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Thewalt U. Bugg C.E. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 8892-8898Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the van der Waals radius of sulfur is 0.45 Å greater than oxygen and this may introduce propellar distortion. 2-AP simply removes the carbonyl functional group from Gua, and the Cyt substitution created a mismatch at this position. Dinucleotide cleavage of the 4/6-thio-Gua substrate by HTLV-2 IN showed levels similar to the WT substrate (Fig.4 A, compare lanes 2and 4). This suggested that carbonyl oxygen in the major groove might not be an important hydrogen bonding acceptor during recognition or catalysis of the U5 end substrate by IN. A smaller amount of cleavage, 1.8-fold decreased as compared with WT dinucleotide level, was also noted at the second site (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). From this result, one might predict that complete removal of the carbonyl group would not effect 3′-processing. However, catalysis of the substrate with the 2-AP substitution showed a 4-fold decrease in 3′-processing (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). This argues for interactions at the major groove in this position. Furthermore, this suggests that we are observing two distinct activities with these substitutions. One activity results from the absence of a major groove acceptor, which causes a decrease in dinucleotide cleavage. The other results from the presence of the isosteric modification, which promotes cleavage at the upstream ACA. Previously, Scottoline et al. (23Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) has shown that the insertion of 2-base pair mismatches immediately 3′ to an internalized CA end will promote internal cleavage of viral DNA substrates. In contrast to this result, we observed internal cleavage at a distance of 3 base pairs when we introduced 6-MeGua in the position 4 of the minus strand, i.e. the third base pair downstream from the internal CA. To further probe the influence of distortion at the position 4, a mismatch was made by substitution of Cyt for Gua (4C/C, Fig. 1 C). A mismatch can create much more distortion in a B-DNA than isosteric nucleotide modifications. 3′-Processing of this substrate by HTLV-2 IN produced cleavage at the internal CA (Fig.4 A, lane 6). Similar results were also observed for a G-G base pair substitution at this site. 3T. Wang, A. J. Piefer, and C. B. Jonsson, unpublished results. A summary of activities of several of the modified substrates used in the cleavage assays is presented in Fig. 5. The result obtained with the 4 C/C substrate, combined with the isosteric substitutions presented above, suggests that the greater the local structural distortions at position 4, the greater the decrease in the dinucleotide product and increase in catalysis at the upstream site. In summary, these results reflect two modes by which IN may interact with the viral end: one which relies on interactions at the major groove contact at this position for 3′-processing, and second, a mechanism that directs recognition and cleavage to the upstream site in the absence of a “correct end.” We were also interested in what effect both major and minor groove alterations had on recognition and catalysis of the strand transfer and disintegration substrates. Previous work with the disintegration substrates has strongly argued in favor of an indirect as opposed to direct sequence readout of the substrate (13Balakrishnan M. Jonsson C.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Donzella G.A. Jonsson C.B. Roth M.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7077-7087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jonsson C.B. Roth M.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5562-5571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chow S. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3896-3907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 6-MeGua and Hyp were substituted at position 4 in the minus strand of precleaved and disintegration substrates of HTLV-2 (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast to our results with the blunt end substrates in the 3′-processing reaction which showed a 5-fold decrease with Hyp (Fig. 2), the precleaved substrate containing the Hyp substitution, 4/Hyp, showed levels of activity similar to the WT substrate in HTLV-2 IN mediated reactions (Fig. 6 A, compare lanes 2 and 4). Moreover, strand transfer activity was not detected when the 6-MeGua substitution was introduced into position 4 (Fig. 6 A, lane 6) or positions 4 and 8 (Fig. 6 A, lane 8). Comparison of the strand transfer reaction products generated by HTLV-2 IN with WT, 4/6-MG, and the 4,8/6-MG blunt substrates showed cleavage at the internal CA in the 4/6-MG, but not the 4,8/6-MG or WT substrate (see Fig. 2). This suggests the internally processed 4/6-MG substrate was not viable for subsequent strand transfer events. The major groove substitution, 2-AP, was also introduced into precleaved substrate. This substrate showed no strand transfer products when incubated with HTLV2 IN as compared with the WT substrate (Fig.6 C, lane 4). Reactions with HTLV-2 IN and modified disintegration substrates were also examined. Similar to IN catalyzed strand transfer reactions with the precleaved substrate containing the Hyp substitution, the Hyp replacement at position 4 in the disintegration substrate had little effect on IN catalysis as compared with activity with the WT disintegration substrates. This substrate yielded a 1.3-fold decrease in disintegration products as compared with the WT substrate (Fig.6 B, compare lanes 2 and 4). PhosphorImager analysis of the products generated from the 4/6-MG and the 4,8/6-MG disintegration substrates showed a greatly reduced level of activity, an 8–10-fold decrease, as compared with the WT disintegration substrate (Fig. 6 B, lanes 6 and8). The introduction of 2-AP into position 4 reduced disintegration activity 10-fold (Fig. 6 D, lane 4) as compared with WT (Fig. 6 D, lane 2). The activities observed in the previous experiments could be due to binding and/or catalytic interactions with the various substrates. To define the contribution of the initial DNA binding interactions, we have employed a nitrocellulose filter binding assay to measure the DNA binding affinity of IN for several of the U5 substrates used herein. It has been demonstrated that IN displays increased specificity for viral DNA ends in the presence of divalent metal ions (27Yi J. Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. Biochem. 1999; 38: 8458-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, binding reactions were performed in the presence of metal under standard reaction conditions using a natively purified HTLV-2 IN and HTLV-2 U5 and modified substrates. Four types of modified U5 substrates were analyzed; those with major groove and minor groove modifications and those with mismatches and substitutions in the conserved C/G base pair at position 4. An additional random substrate, Ran, was also included. The minor groove substitution Hyp, located at position 4 in the minus strand, bound significantly less than the WT HTLV-2 U5 substrate at all concentrations (Fig. 6). Its level of binding was similar to the random substrate, Ran. Substitutions in the major groove of the conserved G included 4/6-MeGua and 2-AP (Fig. 7). Both of these substrates behaved equivalently in the filter binding assay. They bound more than 10 to 15%, respectively, higher than the WT substrate at 3.6 × 10−2 and 7.2 × 10−2 μg/μl, and modestly higher at lower concentrations of IN. The concentration, 3.6 × 10−2μg/μl, was that used in all previous integration and disintegration experiments shown herein. The 4/6-MeGua and 2-AP substrates also bound at significantly higher levels than the Ran substrate. The mismatch substrate, 4C/C, bound nearly the same as the Hyp and Ran substrates, but significantly less than the WT HTLV-2 U5 substrate (Fig. 7). Substrates containing the context of a viral U5 end with a substitution at the conserved 4 position in the minus strand, 4G/C and 4T/A, showed the lowest binding of all the substrates examined; more than 2-fold less than the WT substrate at the two higher concentrations studied. These substrates have no 3′-processing activity. 4T. Wang and C. B. Jonsson, unpublished information. These substrates were also bound significantly less than the Ran substrate, 2–3-fold. Complexes were not observed when IN was not added to the reaction. 5A. J. Piefer and C. B. Jonsson, unpublished observations. In summary, the major groove modifications showed an enhanced binding of the U5 substrate to IN, while the minor groove modification had a decreased binding affinity. The mismatch substrate did not show the enhanced binding, and this suggests that the interaction of IN with this substrate is through a mechanism distinct from that of the 4/6-MeGua and 2-AP substrates. The low binding affinity of IN to the 4G/C, and 4T/A, also indicates an interaction with IN that is unique to these substrates. These data suggest that IN was able to recognize some, but not all, of the key nucleotide functional groups in position 4. Since some determinants were present, it is possible that these substrates were not recognized as targets, but as faulty viral ends. Similar to other INs, the 3′-processing activity of HTLV-2 IN tolerates the insertion of a methyl group into the major groove of the HTLV-2 U5 substrate at positions 3, 4, 5, and 7 in the plus strand and position 3, 5, and 7 in the minus strand, but not at position 4 in the minus strand (17Wang T. Balakrishnan M. Jonsson C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3624-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Introduction of a methyl group at the carbonyl oxygen at position 6 in the carbonyl ring decreased 3′-processing activity and promoted cleavage activity at an upstream CA. The sequence ACA was shown to be required for this novel activity. Two plausible hypotheses for the effect of the 6-MeGua on the 3′-processing reaction were explored. Briefly, our first hypothesis suggested theO 6-methyl group might interfere with 3′-processing of the U5 substrate because it blocks the potential hydrogen bonding acceptor site in the major groove (20Spratt T.E. Levy D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3354-3361Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Voigt J.M. Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1632-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, it has also been reported that 6-MeGua can change the local shape of a base pair (29Patel D.J. Shapiro L. Kozlowski S.A. Gaffney B.L. Jones R.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, we alternatively proposed that this substitution could distort the O-P torsion angle, and thereby, interfere with 3′-processing of the U5 substrate through a change in the local structure of the DNA. Several lines of evidence suggest the loss of the 3′-processing activity was due to a loss in the hydrogen bonding in the major groove by the introduction of the methyl group with the 6-MeGua substitution, and not due to a decreased affinity of IN for the substrate. First, U5 substrates substituted with 2-AP for Gua showed a decrease in 3′-processing, and showed WT levels of binding. Second, while the Cyt mismatch at this position resulted in a loss of activity, which indicated that the local structure was not recognized, filter binding experiments showed that the ability of HTLV-2 IN to bind the substrate was poor. In contrast, filter binding analysis of IN with U5 substrates containing 6-MeGua or 2-AP showed a very high binding affinity as compared with the WT U5 substrate. Therefore, the data suggest that the loss of 3′-processing activity by the 2-AP or 6-MeGua substitutions were due to a loss in hydrogen bonding and not disruption of the local structure. A summary of these results is shown in Table I.Table ISummary of activities of HTLV-2 IN with modified U5 and random substratesU5 substrateAssay1-a±, below 10% WT; +, 10–39% WT; ++, 40–79% WT; +++, 80–99% WT; ++++, greater than 100% WT activity.3′-Processing3′-Processing upstream cleavage1-bUpstream cleavage product level as compared to WT 3′-processing.Strand transferDisintegrationFilter binding4/Hyp+±++++++++4/6-MG++++ND 1-cND, not determined.ND++++4/6-Thio+++++NA 1-dNA, not applicable.NANA2-AP++ND+++++4C/C+++++NANA++4G/CNDNDNANA+4T/ANDNDNANA+RanNDNDNANA+++1-a ±, below 10% WT; +, 10–39% WT; ++, 40–79% WT; +++, 80–99% WT; ++++, greater than 100% WT activity.1-b Upstream cleavage product level as compared to WT 3′-processing.1-c ND, not determined.1-d NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab The available data suggest that the major groove at position 4 does contribute to hydrogen bonding interactions, however, the data also suggest that the distortion in the structure of the DNA molecule promotes cleavage of the upstream ACA. We propose the following model for the retroviral integrase reaction pathway based on these observations (Fig. 8). IN first binds to the retroviral DNA end (Fig. 8, step 1). Our data suggests that minor groove contact at the amine at position 2 of the Gua was a major determinant for a stable IN/substrate interaction. Several groups have shown that certain proteins, for example, SRY and LEF-1, can alter DNA structure through the minor groove. These proteins target certain sequences that may have an intrinsic tendency to underwind and roll one or more base steps. SRY and LEF use an intercalative wedge to pry open a single base step and distort the DNA (30Werner M.H. Gronenborn A. Clore G.M. Science. 1996; 271: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). There is ample evidence that this type of DNA distortion occurs in retroviral integration (23Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,31Chen Z. Yan Y. Munshi S. Li Y. Zugay-Murphy J. Xu B. Witmer M. Felock P. Wolfe A. Sardana V. Emini E.A. Hazuda D. Kuo L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the target of SRY (AACAAA) and LEF (TTCAAA) have a high similarity to the viral termini recognized by retroviral IN. Nevertheless, herein we show the importance of the minor groove in binding of the viral end by the HTLV-2 IN. However, this was not observed for the strand transfer and disintegration substrates. We propose that only WT substrates that contain a conserved C(A/G)T sequence will orient the IN complex in a way as to ensure the ends are processed correctly. The reduced binding affinity IN displayed with the mutations in the 4 position of the HTLV-2 U5 long terminal repeat, the 4G/C and 4T/A substrates supports this hypothesis; i.e. IN does not recognize the key nucleotides at position 4, and therefore releases the substrate. Yi et al. (27Yi J. Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. Biochem. 1999; 38: 8458-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) has reported that flipping of the C(A/G)T causes a decrease in binding in the presence of metal ion. We have reported herein that this reduction in binding can be traced, at least in part, to minor groove interactions at position 4. This mechanism apparently does not hold true for the random substrate, Ran, which showed only a slight reduction in binding. This in turn implies a different set of contacts for the target DNA (sequences without a CA) as proposed by recent modeling studies by Yang et al. (32Yang Z. Mueser T.C. Bushman F.D. Hyde C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 296: 535-548Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A correct orientation in the binding step proceeds to unwinding of substrate (Fig. 7, step 2), and correct cleavage at the 3-2 phosphodiester bond, if there is a major groove O6 contact available at position 4 (Fig. 8, step 4). A transition state that could be present at step 3 would most probably reflect the melting of the three terminal base pairs as proposed by Chen et al. (31Chen Z. Yan Y. Munshi S. Li Y. Zugay-Murphy J. Xu B. Witmer M. Felock P. Wolfe A. Sardana V. Emini E.A. Hazuda D. Kuo L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Those distortions caused by our modified substrates may be viewed by IN as such a transition state described by step 2 in this model for the integration reaction mechanism. In effect, these modified substrates may orient the complex further upstream on the viral DNA, and thus, promote aberrant catalysis of the substrate at an upstream ACA. Interestingly, the greater the distortion at the Cyt/Gua, the greater the increase in the percentage of cleavage at the internal ACA motif. In the case of HIV-1 IN, when a 2-base pair mismatch was placed immediately downstream of an internalized CA, precise cleavage of the substrate occurred (23Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Herein, we have shown that a single mismatch located at the third base pair, downstream of the CA, could promote internal cleavage. Finally, the major groove O6 contact at Gua may also allow the IN·substrate complex to change conformation, and achieve the transition state of the complex, which leads to strand transfer as shown in step 4 of our model. Conformational changes initiated by divalent metal binding have been mapped to all three domains of IN (33Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 34Asante-Appiah E. Seeholzer S.H. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35078-35087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although a metal binding step is not depicted in our model, these conformational changes may allow IN to productively interact with substrate. We hypothesize that other substrate-induced conformational changes may occur immediately before or concurrent to 3′-processing as shown in step 4 of our model, although as of yet this has not been shown. These substrate induced conformational changes could also include reorganization of the IN·substrate complex as well as intramolecular changes in the tetrameric or higher ordered IN structure in preparation for the strand transfer event. Interestingly, when Gua in the conserved and internal AC(A/T)GT sequences was substituted with 6-MeGua or 4,8/6-MG, IN no longer made a precise cleavage at either of the ACA sequences. Cleavages were noted 5′ to the conserved and upstream CA sequences. Imprecise cleavage of a substrate by IN has not been previously documented. However, nonspecific alcoholysis of DNA has been reported, and differs from the cleavage noted with the 4,8/6-MG substrate in that it occurs at most positions in nonviral DNA substrates (35Katzman M. Sudol M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2598-2604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the activity of the 4,8/6-MG substrate we hypothesize that HTLV-2 IN does not recognize the sequence of this substrate, but instead has read the substrate by its structure or rather the distortion introduced by the base modification. The conformation of the substrate may reposition IN on the substrate in such a way as to promote cleavage at the alternative sites. It is clear that conformational changes play an essential role in retroviral integrase catalysis. Additional experiments will further map the chronological and spatial locations of these structural changes as they relate to substrate binding and catalysis by IN.
