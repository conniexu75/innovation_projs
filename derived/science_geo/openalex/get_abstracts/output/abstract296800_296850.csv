https://openalex.org/W1993303053,"This article describes research into Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Loopholes in the principle have led to a series of experiments using sophisticated optical techniques to extract information from a quantum system without disturbing the variable being measured. The experiments are based on a technique called back-action evasion, which exploits the possibility of channeling all the uncertainty generated by measuring one quantum variable (e.g. laser beam intensity) onto a related variable known as the conjugate observable (beam phase). These experiments and others are described."

I have therefore chosen to give some outline of an effort which has been in progress for four or five years only, but which is particularly appropriate to present in this time and place to so many in Washington who have been associated with it. 

The present study of earth movements in California is planned to be of broader scope than a mere statistical study of earthquakes. It is intended to do somewhat more than record tremors with the seismograph, in order, by comparison with other similar records, to trace the path of the waves to a common center of disturbance, and so to obtain information about the manner of their transmission through the interior of the earth. This is a part of a project as heretofore, but we have wished to investigate not only the tremors which may be picked up here of there and their paths traced to a distant point of origin, but their probable causes the earth movements at the source, cumulative mass movements through which the enormous strains are set up and not alone the disturbances which indicate their release."
