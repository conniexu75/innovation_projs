https://openalex.org/W2980292232,"Definitive haematopoiesis in the fetal liver supports self-renewal and differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors (HSC/MPPs) but remains poorly defined in humans. Here, using single-cell transcriptome profiling of approximately 140,000 liver and 74,000 skin, kidney and yolk sac cells, we identify the repertoire of human blood and immune cells during development. We infer differentiation trajectories from HSC/MPPs and evaluate the influence of the tissue microenvironment on blood and immune cell development. We reveal physiological erythropoiesis in fetal skin and the presence of mast cells, natural killer and innate lymphoid cell precursors in the yolk sac. We demonstrate a shift in the haemopoietic composition of fetal liver during gestation away from being predominantly erythroid, accompanied by a parallel change in differentiation potential of HSC/MPPs, which we functionally validate. Our integrated map of fetal liver haematopoiesis provides a blueprint for the study of paediatric blood and immune disorders, and a reference for harnessing the therapeutic potential of HSC/MPPs."

https://openalex.org/W2979747856,"A longstanding goal in neuroscience has been to image membrane voltage across a population of individual neurons in an awake, behaving mammal. Here we describe a genetically encoded fluorescent voltage indicator, SomArchon, which exhibits millisecond response times and is compatible with optogenetic control, and which increases the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio, and number of neurons observable several-fold over previously published fully genetically encoded reagents1-8. Under conventional one-photon microscopy, SomArchon enables the routine population analysis of around 13 neurons at once, in multiple brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, and striatum) of head-fixed, awake, behaving mice. Using SomArchon, we detected both positive and negative responses of striatal neurons during movement, as previously reported by electrophysiology but not easily detected using modern calcium imaging techniques9-11, highlighting the power of voltage imaging to reveal bidirectional modulation. We also examined how spikes relate to the subthreshold theta oscillations of individual hippocampal neurons, with SomArchon showing that the spikes of individual neurons are more phase-locked to their own subthreshold theta oscillations than to local field potential theta oscillations. Thus, SomArchon reports both spikes and subthreshold voltage dynamics in awake, behaving mice."

https://openalex.org/W2980036112,"SF3B1 is the most commonly mutated RNA splicing factor in cancer1-4, but the mechanisms by which SF3B1 mutations promote malignancy are poorly understood. Here we integrated pan-cancer splicing analyses with a positive-enrichment CRISPR screen to prioritize splicing alterations that promote tumorigenesis. We report that diverse SF3B1 mutations converge on repression of BRD9, which is a core component of the recently described non-canonical BAF chromatin-remodelling complex that also contains GLTSCR1 and GLTSCR1L5-7. Mutant SF3B1 recognizes an aberrant, deep intronic branchpoint within BRD9 and thereby induces the inclusion of a poison exon that is derived from an endogenous retroviral element and subsequent degradation of BRD9 mRNA. Depletion of BRD9 causes the loss of non-canonical BAF at CTCF-associated loci and promotes melanomagenesis. BRD9 is a potent tumour suppressor in uveal melanoma, such that correcting mis-splicing of BRD9 in SF3B1-mutant cells using antisense oligonucleotides or CRISPR-directed mutagenesis suppresses tumour growth. Our results implicate the disruption of non-canonical BAF in the diverse cancer types that carry SF3B1 mutations and suggest a mechanism-based therapeutic approach for treating these malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2979968385,"Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the Universe. The Sun's magnetic field drives the solar wind and causes solar flares and other energetic surface phenomena that profoundly affect space weather here on Earth. The first magnetic field in a star other than the Sun was detected in 1947 in the peculiar A-type star 78 Vir. It is now known that the magnetic fields of the Sun and other low-mass stars (<1.5 solar masses) are generated in-situ by a dynamo process in their turbulent, convective envelopes. Unlike such stars, intermediate-mass and high-mass stars (>1.5 solar masses; referred to as ""massive"" stars here) have relatively quiet, radiative envelopes where a solar-like dynamo cannot operate. However, about 10% of them, including 78 Vir, have strong, large-scale surface magnetic fields whose origin has remained a major mystery. The massive star $\tau$ Sco is a prominent member of this group and appears to be surprisingly young compared to other presumably coeval members of the Upper Scorpius association. Here, we present the first 3D magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of the coalescence of two massive main-sequence stars and 1D stellar evolution computations of the subsequent evolution of the merger product that can explain $\tau$ Sco's magnetic field, apparent youth and other observed characteristics. We argue that field amplification in stellar mergers is a general mechanism to form strongly-magnetised massive stars. These stars are promising progenitors of those neutron stars that host the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe, so-called magnetars, and that may give rise to some of the enigmatic fast radio bursts. Strong magnetic fields affect the explosions of core-collapse supernovae and, moreover, those magnetic stars that have rapidly-rotating cores at the end of their lives might provide the right conditions to power long-duration gamma-ray bursts and super-luminous supernovae."
https://openalex.org/W2980159002,"Computing the electronic structure of molecules with high precision is a central challenge in the field of quantum chemistry. Despite the enormous success of approximate methods, tackling this problem exactly with conventional computers is still a formidable task. This has triggered several theoretical and experimental efforts to use quantum computers to solve chemistry problems, with first proof-of-principle realizations done in a digital manner. An appealing alternative to the digital approach is analog quantum simulation, which does not require a scalable quantum computer, and has already been successfully applied in condensed matter physics problems. However, all available or planned setups cannot be used in quantum chemistry problems, since it is not known how to engineer the required Coulomb interactions with them. Here, we present a new approach to the simulation of quantum chemistry problems in an analog way. Our method relies on the careful combination of two technologies: ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices and cavity QED. In the proposed simulator, fermionic atoms hopping in an optical potential play the role of electrons, additional optical potentials provide the nuclear attraction, and a single spin excitation over a Mott insulator mediates the electronic Coulomb repulsion with the help of a cavity mode. We also provide the operational conditions of the simulator and benchmark it with a simple molecule. Our work opens up the possibility of efficiently computing electronic structures of molecules with analog quantum simulation."
https://openalex.org/W2979844096,"The blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae gains entry to its host plant by means of a specialized pressure-generating infection cell called an appressorium, which physically ruptures the leaf cuticle1,2. Turgor is applied as an enormous invasive force by septin-mediated reorganization of the cytoskeleton and actin-dependent protrusion of a rigid penetration hypha3. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the generation of turgor pressure during appressorium-mediated infection of plants remain poorly understood. Here we show that a turgor-sensing histidine-aspartate kinase, Sln1, enables the appressorium to sense when a critical turgor threshold has been reached and thereby facilitates host penetration. We found that the Sln1 sensor localizes to the appressorium pore in a pressure-dependent manner, which is consistent with the predictions of a mathematical model for plant infection. A Δsln1 mutant generates excess intracellular appressorium turgor, produces hyper-melanized non-functional appressoria and does not organize the septins and polarity determinants that are required for leaf infection. Sln1 acts in parallel with the protein kinase C cell-integrity pathway as a regulator of cAMP-dependent signalling by protein kinase A. Pkc1 phosphorylates the NADPH oxidase regulator NoxR and, collectively, these signalling pathways modulate appressorium turgor and trigger the generation of invasive force to cause blast disease."
https://openalex.org/W2979411292,"The development of chemoresistance remains a major challenge that accounts for colorectal cancer (CRC) lethality. Dichloroacetate (DCA) was originally used as a metabolic regulator in the treatment of metabolic diseases; here, DCA was assayed to identify the mechanisms underlying the chemoresistance of CRC. We found that DCA markedly enhanced chemosensitivity of CRC cells to fluorouracil (5-FU), and reduced the colony formation due to high levels of apoptosis. Using the microarray assay, we noted that miR-149-3p was involved in the chemoresistance of CRC, which was modulated by wild-type p53 after DCA treatment. In addition, PDK2 was identified as a direct target of miR-149-3p. Mechanistic analyses showed that overexpression of miR-149-3p enhanced 5-FU-induced apoptosis and reduced glucose metabolism, similar to the effects of PDK2 knockdown. In addition, overexpression of PDK2 partially reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-149-3p on glucose metabolism. Finally, both DCA treatment and miR-149-3p overexpression in 5-FU-resistant CRC cells were found to markedly sensitize the chemotherapeutic effect of 5-FU in vivo, and this effect was also validated in a small retrospective cohort of CRC patients. Taken together, we determined that the p53/miR-149-3p/PDK2 signaling pathway can potentially be targeted with DCA treatment to overcome chemoresistant CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2980084368,"Transition-metal complexes are widely used in the physical and biological sciences. They have essential roles in catalysis, synthesis, materials science, photophysics and bioinorganic chemistry. Our understanding of transition-metal complexes originates from Alfred Werner’s realization that their three-dimensional shape influences their properties and reactivity1, and the intrinsic link between shape and electronic structure is now firmly underpinned by molecular-orbital theory2–5. Despite more than a century of advances in this field, the geometries of transition-metal complexes remain limited to a few well-understood examples. The archetypal geometries of six-coordinate transition metals are octahedral and trigonal prismatic, and although deviations from ideal bond angles and bond lengths are frequent6, alternative parent geometries are extremely rare7. The hexagonal planar coordination environment is known, but it is restricted to condensed metallic phases8, the hexagonal pores of coordination polymers9, or clusters that contain more than one transition metal in close proximity10,11. Such a geometry had been considered12,13 for [Ni(PtBu)6]; however, an analysis of the molecular orbitals suggested that this complex is best described as a 16-electron species with a trigonal planar geometry14. Here we report the isolation and structural characterization of a simple coordination complex in which six ligands form bonds with a central transition metal in a hexagonal planar arrangement. The structure contains a central palladium atom surrounded by three hydride and three magnesium-based ligands. This finding has the potential to introduce additional design principles for transition-metal complexes, with implications for several scientific fields. A six-coordinate transition-metal complex with a hexagonal planar geometry is isolated and characterized."

https://openalex.org/W2966229683,"Early clinical successes are driving enthusiasm for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the transfer of healthy gut bacteria through whole stool, as emerging research is linking the microbiome to many different diseases. However, preliminary trials have yielded mixed results and suggest that heterogeneity in donor stool may play a role in patient response. Thus, clinical trials may fail because an ineffective donor was chosen rather than because FMT is not appropriate for the indication. Here, we describe a conceptual framework to guide rational donor selection to increase the likelihood that FMT clinical trials will succeed. We argue that the mechanism by which the microbiome is hypothesized to be associated with a given indication should inform how healthy donors are selected for FMT trials, categorizing these mechanisms into four disease models and presenting associated donor selection strategies. We next walk through examples based on previously published FMT trials and ongoing investigations to illustrate how donor selection might occur in practice. Finally, we show that typical FMT trials are not powered to discover individual taxa mediating patient responses, suggesting that clinicians should develop targeted hypotheses for retrospective analyses and design their clinical trials accordingly. Moving forward, developing and applying novel clinical trial design methodologies like rational donor selection will be necessary to ensure that FMT successfully translates into clinical impact."
https://openalex.org/W2979521863,"What types of refugees do Americans prefer for admission into the United States? Scholars have explored the immigrant characteristics that appeal to Americans and the characteristics that Europeans prioritize in asylum-seekers, but we currently do not know which refugee characteristics Americans prefer. We conduct a conjoint experiment on a representative sample of 1800 US adults, manipulating refugee attributes in pairs of Syrian refugee profiles, and ask respondents to rate each refugee’s appeal. Our focus on Syrian refugees in a 2016 survey experiment allows us to speak to the concurrent refugee crisis on the eve of a polarizing election, while also identifying religious discrimination, holding constant the refugee’s national origin. We find that Americans prefer Syrian refugees who are female, high-skilled, English-speaking, and Christian, suggesting they prioritize refugee integration into the U.S. labor and cultural markets. We find that the preference for female refugees is not driven by the desire to exclude Muslim male refugees, casting doubt that American preferences at the time were motivated by security concerns. Finally, we find that anti-Muslim bias in refugee preferences varies in magnitude across key subgroups, though it prevails across all sample demographics."
https://openalex.org/W2980031355,"Cells damaged by mechanical or infectious injury release proinflammatory mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments into the circulation. We evaluated the relation between plasma levels of mtDNA fragments in obese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and measures of chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. In 10 obese T2DM patients and 12 healthy control (HC) subjects, we measured levels of plasma cell-free mtDNA with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and mtDNA damage in skeletal muscle with quantitative alkaline Southern blot. Also, markers of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress in skeletal muscle were measured. Plasma levels of mtDNA fragments, mtDNA damage in skeletal muscle and plasma tumor necrosis factor α levels were greater in obese T2DM patients than HC subjects. Also, the abundance of plasma mtDNA fragments in obese T2DM patients levels positively correlated with insulin resistance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published evidence that elevated level of plasma mtDNA fragments is associated with mtDNA damage and oxidative stress in skeletal muscle and correlates with insulin resistance in obese T2DM patients. Plasma mtDNA may be a useful biomarker for predicting and monitoring insulin resistance in obese patients."
https://openalex.org/W2979346640,"Recent studies using two cholesterol-binding bacterial toxin proteins, perfringolysin O (PFO) and domain 4 of anthrolysin O (ALOD4), have shown that cholesterol in the plasma membranes (PMs) of animal cells resides in three distinct pools. The first pool comprises mobile cholesterol, accessible to both PFO and ALOD4, that is rapidly transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to signal cholesterol excess and maintain cholesterol homeostasis. The second is a sphingomyelin (SM)-sequestered pool inaccessible to PFO and ALOD4 but that becomes accessible by treatment with SM-degrading sphingomyelinase (SMase). The third is an essential pool also inaccessible to PFO and ALOD4 that cannot be liberated by SMase treatment. The accessible cholesterol pool can be trapped on PMs of live cells by nonlytic ALOD4, blocking its transport to the ER. However, studies of the two other pools have been hampered by a lack of available tools. Here, we used ostreolysin A (OlyA), which specifically binds SM/cholesterol complexes in membranes, to study the SM-sequestered cholesterol pool. Binding of nonlytic OlyA to SM/cholesterol complexes in PMs of live cells depleted the accessible PM cholesterol pool detectable by ALOD4. Consequently, transport of accessible cholesterol from PM to ER ceased, thereby activating SREBP transcription factors and increasing cholesterol synthesis. Thus, OlyA and ALOD4 both control movement of PM cholesterol, but through different lipid-binding mechanisms. We also found that PM-bound OlyA was rapidly internalized into cells, whereas PM-bound ALOD4 remained on the cell surface. Our findings establish OlyA and ALOD4 as complementary tools to investigate cellular cholesterol transport.

When PM cholesterol levels deviate from their optimal range, the ER regulatory network responds rapidly and modulates the activity of SREBP2 transcription factors, which control genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake (2Horton J.D.

When PM cholesterol was below a threshold concentration of ∼30 mol % of total PM lipids, it was largely inaccessible to bind to perfringolysin O (PFO), a cholesterol-binding protein (11Das A.

Above this threshold, PM cholesterol became accessible, and the binding of PFO to PMs increased sharply. In addition to binding PFO, the accessible pool of PM cholesterol was mobile, rapidly moving to the ER to signal cholesterol surplus and shut down activation of SREBPs (9Das A. Brown M.S. Anderson D.D. Goldstein J.L. Radhakrishnan A.

The mobile pool of accessible cholesterol could be trapped on the PMs of cells at 37 °C by domain 4 of anthrolysin O (ALOD4), a cholesterol-binding protein that is closely related to PFO but that is nonlytic at 37 °C. As a result, transport of accessible PM cholesterol to the ER was halted, triggering activation of SREBP even when PM cholesterol was well-above the threshold set-point (10Infante R.E. Radhakrishnan A.

The studies with PFO and ALOD4 showed that cholesterol adopted different forms in PMs and highlighted the signaling function of the accessible form. However, far less is known about the roles played by the other forms of PM cholesterol that are inaccessible to PFO and ALOD4. The earlier studies showed that about half of the inaccessible form of PM cholesterol (∼15 mol % of PM lipids) is sequestered by sphingomyelin (SM), whereas the remainder of inaccessible PM cholesterol is sequestered by other membrane factors and is essential for cellular viability (9Das A. Brown M.S. Anderson D.D. Goldstein J.L. Radhakrishnan A. Three pools of plasma membrane cholesterol and their relation to cholesterol homeostasis.Elife. 2014; 3: e0288210.7554/eLife.02882Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with sphingomyelinase (SMase), a soluble, membrane-impermeable enzyme that degrades SM, releases the SM-sequestered cholesterol, rendering it capable of binding to PFO and moving to the ER (a finding that is in line with earlier studies (14Scheek S.

Thus far, further understanding of SM-sequestered cholesterol has been hindered by a lack of experimental tools. Fortunately, we recently characterized a fungal protein, ostreolysin A (OlyA), that specifically binds SM/cholesterol complexes in membranes (16Endapally S. Frias D. Grzemska M. Gay A. Tomchick D.R.

Tracking cholesterol/sphingomyelin-rich membrane domains with the ostreolysin A-mCherry protein.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 (24664106): e9278310.1371/journal.pone.0092783Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), making it possible to use it to study cholesterol homeostasis in living cells. Here, we use the newly-described OlyA and the previously-characterized ALOD4 to compare the localization and dynamics of SM-sequestered and accessible pools of cholesterol, respectively, in the PM of live cells. We find that binding of OlyA to SM/cholesterol complexes in the PM depletes the pool of accessible cholesterol in PMs that can transport to the ER, thus activating SREBP2. Our data indicate how controlling the distribution of cholesterol between accessible and inaccessible forms regulates overall cholesterol homeostasis in animal cells. We overexpressed and purified recombinant His6-tagged versions of both ALOD4 and OlyA, as described under “Experimental procedures.” The homogeneity of the purified proteins was confirmed by Coomassie staining (Fig. 1A). When CHO-K1 cells were incubated with these proteins at 37 °C, we observed dose-dependent binding of both ALOD4 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–6) and OlyA (Fig. 1B, lanes 7–12). We next checked whether the binding of these sensor proteins to PMs caused lysis of CHO-K1 cells by monitoring the release of a cytosolic protein, ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), into the extracellular medium (Fig. 1C). Addition of ALOD4 and OlyA at concentrations of 30 μm did not result in any cell lysis (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, addition of the full-length version of ALO (ALOFL), which forms large oligomeric pores in cells (21Bourdeau R.W. Malito E. Chenal A. Bishop B.L. Musch M.W. Villereal M.L. Chang E.B.

We then assessed the lipid specificities of nonlytic ALOD4 and OlyA for binding to CHO-K1 cells at 37 °C. For these experiments, cells were set up in lipoprotein-rich FCS. First, we examined their binding dependence on SM by treating cells with SMase (Fig. 2A). We observed that SMase treatment led to a small increase in ALOD4 binding (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2), but completely eliminated OlyA binding (lanes 3 and 4). Mass spectrometry analysis showed that SMase treatment reduced overall cellular SM content by 76% (Fig. 2B). Next, we examined their binding dependence on cholesterol by treating cells with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD), a reagent that extracts cholesterol from membranes (Fig. 2C). When treated with increasing concentrations of HPCD, binding of ALOD4 declined sharply and was completely eliminated after treatment with 1% HPCD (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–6). Binding of OlyA did not decline as sharply and was completely eliminated only at the highest concentration tested of 2% HPCD (Fig. 2C, lanes 7–12). Mass spectrometry analysis showed that treatment with 2% HPCD reduced overall cellular cholesterol content by 42% (Fig. 2D). The observed SM and cholesterol dependences of ALOD4 and OlyA at 37 °C are consistent with previous binding studies that were carried out at 4 °C (16Endapally S. Frias D. Grzemska M. Gay A. Tomchick D.R. Radhakrishnan A. Molecular discrimination between two conformations of sphingomyelin in plasma membranes.Cell. 2019; 176 (30712872): 1040-1053.e1710.1016/j.cell.2018.12.042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We also prepared fluorescently labeled versions of ALOD4 and OlyA, as described under “Experimental procedures,” to directly visualize their binding to the cell surface. When CHO-K1 cells were simultaneously incubated with both fluorescent sensors for 5 min, and then observed by Airyscan confocal microscopy after fixation, we detected punctate staining patterns for both probes (Fig. 2E, also see Fig. 6A). An overlay of the individual staining patterns of ALOD4 and OlyA revealed some regions where there was a strong overlap of the two signals and other regions where there was no overlap (Fig. 2E). In this study, we did not further characterize the spatial distribution of ALOD4 and OlyA, but instead we focused on how their binding affected cholesterol distribution and transport.Figure 6Internalization of OlyA by CHO-K1 cells and effects on intracellular trafficking of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol. On day 0, CHO-K1 cells were set up in medium B at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells per well of an 8-well Lab-Tek II chambered #1.5 coverglass dish (A) or 6 × 104 cells per well of a 48-well plate (B).

After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were either left undisturbed (lanes 1 and 2) or washed five times with PBS to remove all surface-bound OlyA (lanes 3 and 4). The washed cells were then treated with 200 μl of medium F supplemented with 10 μg/ml β-vLDL and the indicated concentrations of OlyA (lanes 3 and 4).

When we first added ALOD4 to cells, we observed the expected dose-dependent increase in ALOD4 binding (Fig. 3A). We then added a constant amount of OlyA to these ALOD4-treated cells and observed that the previously-bound ALOD4 did not affect the subsequent binding of OlyA (Fig. 3A). This result is in line with previous observations that the levels of SM-sequestered cholesterol are relatively constant over a wide range of cholesterol concentrations (9Das A. Brown M.S. Anderson D.D. Goldstein J.L. Radhakrishnan A.

We then reversed the order of addition and first added OlyA to cells. Again, we observed the expected dose-dependent increase in OlyA binding (Fig. 3B). However, a surprising result was observed when we then added a fixed amount of ALOD4 to these OlyA-treated cells. Robust ALOD4 binding was observed in the absence of OlyA preincubation (Fig. 3B, lane 1), but this binding steadily decreased and was eventually eliminated with increased pre-binding of OlyA (Fig. 3B, lanes 2–6). The elimination of ALOD4 binding occurred even though the cholesterol content of the cells was not altered by pre-treatment with OlyA (Fig. 3C). The results of Fig. 3 suggested to us that stabilization of SM/cholesterol complexes by OlyA binding was depleting the pool of accessible cholesterol available for binding to ALOD4. Because accessible PM cholesterol is transported to the ER to shut down lipogenic processes (9Das A. Brown M.S. Anderson D.D. Goldstein J.L. Radhakrishnan A.

To monitor the effects of OlyA treatment on ER cholesterol levels, we assayed for the following: (i) proteolytic processing of SREBP2; ii) levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis (23Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Regulation of the mevalonate pathway.Nature. 1990; 43 (1967820): 425-43010.1038/343425a0Google Scholar); and (iii) activity of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), an ER enzyme that esterifies some of the lipoprotein-derived cholesterol that arrives at the ER (24Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Receptor-mediated endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein in cultured cells.Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98 (6321901): 241-26010.1016/0076-6879(83)98152-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar, 25Chang T.-Y Chang C.Y.

As a control for these studies, we used ALOD4, which traps accessible PM cholesterol and prevents its transport to the ER, thereby lowering ER cholesterol even though cellular or PM cholesterol does not change (10Infante R.E. Radhakrishnan A. Continuous transport of a small fraction of plasma membrane cholesterol to endoplasmic reticulum regulates total cellular cholesterol.Elife. 2017; 6 (28414269): e2546610.7554/eLife.25466Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As another control, we overexpressed and purified a version of OlyA containing a point mutation (W6A), hereafter designated as OlyA(Mut), that abolishes OlyA's binding to membranes (16Endapally S. Frias D. Grzemska M. Gay A. Tomchick D.R. Radhakrishnan A. Molecular discrimination between two conformations of sphingomyelin in plasma membranes.Cell. 2019; 176 (30712872): 1040-1053.e1710.1016/j.cell.2018.12.042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We first studied the effects of OlyA treatment on cholesterol-replete cells. In one experiment, CHO-K1 cells were set up in lipoprotein-rich FCS, incubated with either ALOD4, OlyA, or OlyA(Mut), and then subjected to immunoblot analysis of SREBP2 (Fig. 4A). ALOD4 bound to the cholesterol-rich PMs of these cells and triggered the processing of SREBP2 from its inactive precursor form to its active nuclear form (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–4), a result that is consistent with previous observations (10Infante R.E. Radhakrishnan A. Continuous transport of a small fraction of plasma membrane cholesterol to endoplasmic reticulum regulates total cellular cholesterol.Elife. 2017; 6 (28414269): e2546610.7554/eLife.25466Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). OlyA also bound to PMs and caused proteolytic activation of SREBP2 (Fig. 4A, lanes 5–8), whereas OlyA(Mut), when added at the same levels as OlyA, did not bind to cells or affect SREBP2 processing (lanes 9–12). In another experiment, CHO-K1 cells were again set up in lipoprotein-rich FCS, incubated with either OlyA, OlyA(Mut), or ALOD4, and then subjected to immunoblot analysis of HMGCR (Fig. 4B). In the absence of treatment with any protein, HMGCR protein levels were undetectable (Fig. 4B, lane 1). Incubation with OlyA, but not OlyA (Mut), led to binding to cells and a subsequent increase in HMGCR levels (Fig. 4B, lanes 2–5). ALOD4 also bound to cells and led to an increase in HMGCR levels (Fig. 4B, lane 6). The rise in HMGCR levels after treatment with OlyA or ALOD4 was similar to that observed after extreme cholesterol depletion by HPCD (Fig. 4B, lane 7). We next studied the effects of OlyA treatment on cholesterol-depleted cells. In one experiment, CHO-K1 cells were depleted of cholesterol by incubation in lipoprotein-poor LPDS along with compactin, an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis. We then added back lipoproteins (LDL) along with [14C]oleate, and after 3 h, we processed the cells for measurement of cholesteryl [14C]oleate. As shown in Fig. 4C, we observed an increase in cholesteryl [14C]oleate formation after LDL addition, and this increase was blocked when either OlyA or ALOD4 was included during the incubation with LDL and [14C]oleate. In contrast, incubation with OlyA(Mut) did not significantly affect cholesteryl [14C]oleate formation. In another experiment, CHO-K1 cells were depleted of cholesterol by incubation with cholesterol-extracting HPCD, which triggered the processing of SREBP2 to its active nuclear form (Fig. 4D, lane 1). Addition of β-vLDL, another lipoprotein that is enriched in cholesteryl esters (26Kovanen P.T. Brown M.S. Basu S.K. Bilheimer D.W. Goldstein J.L.

Although significant advances have decreased their size, cost and accessibility, their designs and assembly remain rather complex. Here, inspired on the simple mechanism from a nut and a bolt, we report the construction of a portable fluorescence microscope that operates in bright-field mode and in three fluorescence channels: UV, green, and red. It is assembled in under 10 min from only six 3D printed parts, basic electronic components, a microcomputer (Raspberry Pi) and a camera, all of which can be readily purchased in most locations or online for US $122. The microcomputer was programmed in Python language to capture time-lapse images and videos. Resolution and illumination conditions of the microscope were characterized, and its performance was compared with a high-end fluorescence microscope in bright-field and fluorescence mode. We demonstrate that our miniature microscope can resolve and track single cells in both modes. The instructions on how to assemble the microscope are shown in a video, and the software to control it and the design files of the 3D-printed parts are freely available online. Our portable microscope is ideal in applications where space is at a premium, such as lab-on-a-chips or space missions, and can find applications in basic and clinical research, diagnostics, telemedicine and in educational settings."

Traditional population-based methods may fail to capture important events, particularly in settings with limited access to health care, such as urban informal settlements. In such environments, a mixture of surface water runoff and human feces containing pathogenic microorganisms could be used as a surveillance surrogate.We conducted a temporal metagenomic analysis of urban sewage from Kibera, an urban informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya, to detect and quantify bacterial and associated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants, viral and parasitic pathogens. Data were examined in conjunction with data from ongoing clinical infectious disease surveillance.A large variation of read abundances related to bacteria, viruses, and parasites of medical importance, as well as bacterial associated antimicrobial resistance genes over time were detected. Significant increased abundances were observed for a number of bacterial pathogens coinciding with higher abundances of AMR genes. Vibrio cholerae as well as rotavirus A, among other virus peaked in several weeks during the study period whereas Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp, varied more over time.The metagenomic surveillance approach for monitoring circulating pathogens in sewage was able to detect putative pathogen and resistance loads in an urban informal settlement. Thus, valuable if generated in real time to serve as a comprehensive infectious disease agent surveillance system with the potential to guide disease prevention and treatment. The approach may lead to a paradigm shift in conducting real-time global genomics-based surveillance in settings with limited access to health care."

Hormonally up-regulated neu-associated kinase (HUNK) kinase is up-regulated in aggressive breast cancers and is thought to play a role in breast cancer metastasis. However, no studies have been conducted to examine a relationship between EGFR and HUNK in breast cancer metastasis. We performed a kinase substrate screen and identified that EGFR is phosphorylated by HUNK. Our studies show that HUNK phosphorylates EGFR at T654, enhancing receptor stability and downstream signaling. We found that increased phosphorylation of T654 EGFR correlates with increased epithelial to mesenchymal, migration and invasion, and metastasis. In addition, we found that HUNK expression correlates with overall survival and distant metastasis free survival. This study shows that HUNK directly phosphorylates EGFR at T654 to promote metastasis and is the first study to show that the phosphorylation of this site in EGFR regulates metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2979485765,"Transforming growth factor‑β1 (TGF-β1) is a versatile cytokine. It has context-dependent pro- and anti-cell proliferation functions. Activation of latent TGF-β1 requires release of the growth factor from pro-complexes and is regulated through TGF-β binding proteins. Two types of TGF-β binding partners, latent TGF-β-binding proteins (LTBPs) and leucine-rich-repeat-containing protein 32 (LRRC32), have been identified and their expression are cell specific. TGF-β1 also plays important roles in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. However, the expression of LTBPs and LRRC32 are lacking in myeloid lineage cells and the binding protein of TGF-β1 in these cells are unknown. Here we show that a novel leucine-rich-repeat-containing protein family member, LRRC33, with high mRNA level in AML cells, to be the binding and regulating protein of TGF-β1 in AML cells. Using two representative cell lines MV4-11 and AML193, we demonstrate that the protein expression of LRRC33 and TGF-β1 are correlated. LRRC33 co-localizes and forms complex with latent TGF-β1 protein on the cell surface and intracellularly in these cells. Similar as in other cell types, the activation of TGF-β1 in MV4-11 and AML193 cells are also integrin dependent.

Accurate roe deer population size estimates are useful to ensure their proper management. We tested 3 methods for estimating roe deer abundance (drive counts, pellet-group counts, and camera trapping) during two consecutive years (2012 and 2013) in the Apennines (Italy) in order to assess their precision and applicability. During the study period, population density estimates were: drive counts 21.89±12.74 roe deer/km2 and pellet-group counts 18.74±2.31 roe deer/km2 in 2012; drive counts 19.32±11.12 roe deer/km2 and camera trapping 29.05±7.48 roe deer/km2 in 2013. Precision of the density estimates differed widely among the 3 methods, with coefficients of variation ranging from 12% (pellet-group counts) to 58% (drive counts). Drive counts represented the most demanding method on account of the higher number of operators involved. Pellet-group counts yielded the most precise results and required a smaller number of operators, though the sampling effort was considerable. When compared to the other two methods, camera trapping resulted in an intermediate level of precision and required the lowest sampling effort. We also discussed field protocols of each method, considering that volunteers, rather than technicians, will more likely be appointed for these tasks in the near future. For this reason, we strongly suggest that for each method managers of population density monitoring projects take into account ease of use as well as the quality of the results obtained and the resources required."

Primaquine (PQ) and methylene blue (MB) are gametocytocidal drugs that can be combined with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) to reduce malaria transmission, including resistant strains. Children (6–59 months) with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Burkina Faso were treated with artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) and randomized to MB (15 mg/kg/day for 3 days) or PQ (0.25 mg/kg at day 2) with the aim to show non-inferiority of the MB regimen with regard to haematological recovery at day 7 (primary endpoint). MB-AS-AQ could not be shown to be non-inferior to PQ-AS-AQ (mean Hb difference between treatment groups on day 7 was -0.352, 95% CI -0.832–0.128, p = 0.0767), however, haemoglobin recovery following treatment was alike in the two study arms (day 7: mean 0.2±1.4 g/dl vs. 0.5±0.9 g/dl, p = 0.446). Occurrence of adverse events was similar in both groups, except for vomiting, which was more frequent in the MB than in the PQ arm (20/50 vs 7/50, p = 0.003). Adequate clinical and parasitological response was above 95% in both groups, but significantly more asexual parasites were cleared in the MB arm compared to the PQ arm already on day 1 (48/50, 96%, vs 40/50, 80%, p = 0.014). Moreover, P. falciparum gametocyte prevalence and density were lower in the MB arm than in the PQ arm, which reached statistical significance on day 2 (prevalence: 2/50, 4%, vs 15/49, 31%, p<0.001; density: 9.6 vs 41.1/μl, p = 0.024). However, it should be considered that PQ was given only on day 2. MB-ACT appears to be an interesting alternative to PQ-ACT for the treatment of falciparum malaria. While there is a need to further improve MB formulations, MB-ACT may already be considered useful to reduce falciparum malaria transmission intensity, to increase treatment efficacy, and to reduce the risk for resistance development and spread.

The protein component of DNA–protein cross-links can be proteolytically degraded, resulting in smaller DNA–peptide cross-links. Unlike full-size DNA–protein cross-links that completely block replication and transcription, DNA–peptide cross-links can be bypassed by DNA and RNA polymerases and can potentially be repaired via the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2979358305,"Background Methamphetamine (MA) is a potent agonist at the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). This study evaluated a common variant (CV) in the human TAAR1 gene, synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) V288V, to determine the involvement of TAAR1 in MA dependence. Methods Participants (n = 106) with active MA dependence (MA-ACT), in remission from MA dependence (MA-REM), with active polysubstance dependence, in remission from polysubstance dependence, and with no history of substance dependence completed neuropsychiatric symptom questionnaires and provided blood samples. In vitro expression and function of CV and wild type TAAR1 receptors were also measured. Results The V288V polymorphism demonstrated a 40% increase in TAAR1 protein expression in cell culture, but message sequence and protein function were unchanged, suggesting an increase in translation efficiency. Principal components analysis resolved neuropsychiatric symptoms into four components, PC1 (depression, anxiety, memory, and fatigue), PC2 (pain), PC3 (drug and alcohol craving), and PC4 (sleep disturbances). Analyses of study group and TAAR1 genotype revealed a significant interaction for PC3 (craving response) (p = 0.003). The control group showed no difference in PC3 associated with TAAR1, while adjusted mean craving for the MA-ACT and MA-REM groups, among those with at least one copy of V288V, was estimated to be, respectively, 1.55 (p = 0.036) and 1.77 (p = 0.071) times the adjusted mean craving for those without the TAAR1 SNP. Conclusions Neuroadaptation to chronic MA use may be altered by TAAR1 genotype and result in increased dopamine signaling and craving in individuals with the V288V genotype."
https://openalex.org/W2979834147,"Rare diseases (RD) result in a wide variety of clinical presentations, and this creates a significant diagnostic challenge for health care professionals. We hypothesized that there exist a set of consistent and shared phenomena among all individuals affected by (different) RD during the time before diagnosis is established.We aimed to identify commonalities between different RD and developed a machine learning diagnostic support tool for RD.20 interviews with affected individuals with different RD, focusing on the time period before their diagnosis, were performed and qualitatively analyzed. Out of these pre-diagnostic experiences, we distilled key phenomena and created a questionnaire which was then distributed among individuals with the established diagnosis of i.) RD, ii.) other common non-rare diseases (NRO) iii.) common chronic diseases (CD), iv.), or psychosomatic/somatoform disorders (PSY). Finally, four combined single machine learning methods and a fusion algorithm were used to distinguish the different answer patterns of the questionnaires.The questionnaire contained 53 questions. A total sum of 1763 questionnaires (758 RD, 149 CD, 48 PSY, 200 NRO, 34 healthy individuals and 574 not evaluable questionnaires) were collected. Based on 3 independent data sets the 10-fold stratified cross-validation method for the answer-pattern recognition resulted in sensitivity values of 88.9% to detect the answer pattern of a RD, 86.6% for NRO, 87.7% for CD and 84.2% for PSY.Despite the great diversity in presentation and pathogenesis of each RD, patients with RD share surprisingly similar pre-diagnosis experiences. Our questionnaire and data-mining based approach successfully detected unique patterns in groups of individuals affected by a broad range of different rare diseases. Therefore, these results indicate distinct patterns that may be used for diagnostic support in RD."
https://openalex.org/W2979855672,"A fundamental question regarding music processing is its degree of independence from speech processing, in terms of their underlying neuroanatomy and influence of cognitive traits and abilities. Although a straight answer to that question is still lacking, a large number of studies have described where in the brain and in which contexts (tasks, stimuli, populations) this independence is, or is not, observed. We examined the independence between music and speech processing using functional magnetic resonance imagining and a stimulation paradigm with different human vocal sounds produced by the same voice. The stimuli were grouped as Speech (spoken sentences), Hum (hummed melodies), and Song (sung sentences); the sentences used in Speech and Song categories were the same, as well as the melodies used in the two musical categories. Each category had a scrambled counterpart which allowed us to render speech and melody unintelligible, while preserving global amplitude and frequency characteristics. Finally, we included a group of musicians to evaluate the influence of musical expertise. Similar global patterns of cortical activity were related to all sound categories compared to baseline, but important differences were evident. Regions more sensitive to musical sounds were located bilaterally in the anterior and posterior superior temporal gyrus (planum polare and temporale), the right supplementary and premotor areas, and the inferior frontal gyrus. However, only temporal areas and supplementary motor cortex remained music-selective after subtracting brain activity related to the scrambled stimuli. Speech-selective regions mainly affected by intelligibility of the stimuli were observed on the left pars opecularis and the anterior portion of the medial temporal gyrus. We did not find differences between musicians and non-musicians Our results confirmed music-selective cortical regions in associative cortices, independent of previous musical training."
https://openalex.org/W2979994264,"Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare and intractable metabolic bone disease caused by mutations in the ALPL gene. Here, we undertook a nationwide survey of HPP in Japan, specifically regarding the prominent genetic and dental manifestations of odonto (n = 16 cases) and other (termed “non-odonto”) (n = 36 cases) types. Mean serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) values in odonto-type patients were significantly greater than those of non-odonto-type patients (P<0.05). Autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance patterns were detected, respectively, in 89% of odonto-type and 96% of non-odonto-type patients. The ALPL “c.1559delT” mutation, associated with extremely low ALP activity, was found in approximately 70% of cases. Regarding dental manifestations, all patients classified as odonto-type showed early exfoliation of the primary teeth significantly more frequently than patients classified as non-odonto-type (100% vs. 56%; P<0.05). Tooth hypomineralisation was detected in 42% of non-odonto-type patients, but not in any odonto-type patients (0%; P<0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that genetic and dental manifestations of patients with odonto-type and non-odonto-type HPP are significantly different, and these differences should be considered during clinical treatment of patients with HPP."
https://openalex.org/W2980105872,"Background Endometrial cancer presents well-defined risk factors: myometrial invasion, histological subtype, tumor grade, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI). Some low and intermediate-risk endometrioid endometrial cancer patients exhibited unexpected outcomes. This study aimed to investigate other clinical-pathological factors that might influence the recurrence rates of patients diagnosed with low and intermediate-risk endometrioid endometrial cancer. Methods A case-control study from a cohort retrospective of 196 patients diagnosed with low and intermediate-risk endometrioid endometrial cancer at a single institution from 2009 to 2014 was conducted. Medical records were reviewed to compare clinical (race, smoking, menopause age, body mass index) and pathological (endometrioid vs endometrioid with squamous differentiation, tumor differentiation grade, tumor location, endocervical invasion, LVSI) features of patients with recurrence (case) and without recurrence (control) of disease. Three controls for each case were matched for age and staging. Results Twenty-one patients with recurrence were found (10.7%), of which 14 were stage IA, and 7 were stage IB. In accordance, 63 patients without recurrence were selected as controls. There were no significant differences in any clinical characteristics between cases and controls. Among pathological variables, presence of squamous differentiation (28.6% vs. 4.8%, p = 0.007), tumor differentiation grade 2 or 3 (57.1% vs. 30.2%, p = 0.037) and presence of endocervical invasion (28.6% vs. 12.7%, p = 0.103) were associated with disease recurrence on a univariate analysis. On multivariable analysis, only squamous differentiation was a significant risk factor for recurrence (p = 0.031). Conclusion Our data suggest that squamous differentiation may be an adverse prognostic factor in patients with low and intermediate-risk endometrioid endometrial cancer, that showed a 5.6-fold increased risk for recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2980188599,"In single molecule fluorescence studies, background emission from labeled substrates often restricts their concentrations to non-physiological nanomolar values. One approach to address this challenge is the use of zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs), nanoscale holes in a thin metal film that physically and optically confine the observation volume allowing much higher concentrations of fluorescent substrates. Standard fabrication of ZMWs utilizes slow and costly E-beam nano-lithography. Herein, ZMWs are made using a self-assembled mask of polystyrene microspheres, enabling fabrication of thousands of ZMWs in parallel without sophisticated equipment. Polystyrene 1 μm dia. microbeads self-assemble on a glass slide into a hexagonal array, forming a mask for the deposition of metallic posts in the inter-bead interstices. The width of those interstices (and subsequent posts) is adjusted within 100–300 nm by partially fusing the beads at the polystyrene glass transition temperature. The beads are dissolved in toluene, aluminum or gold cladding is deposited around the posts, and those are dissolved, leaving behind an array ZMWs. Parameter optimization and the performance of the ZMWs are presented. By using colloidal self-assembly, typical laboratories can make use of sub-wavelength ZMW technology avoiding the availability and expense of sophisticated clean-room environments and equipment."
https://openalex.org/W2980148384,"The diversity of bats worldwide includes large numbers of cryptic species, partly because divergence in acoustic traits such as echolocation calls are under stronger selection than differences in visual appearance in these nocturnal mammals. Island faunas often contain disproportionate numbers of endemic species, and hence we might expect cryptic, endemic species to be discovered relatively frequently in bats inhabiting islands. Species are best defined when multiple lines of evidence supports their diagnosis. Here we use morphometric, acoustic, and molecular phylogenetic data to show that a horseshoe bat in the Andaman Islands is distinct in all three aspects, supporting its status as a distinct species. We recommend investigation into possible new and endemic bat species on islands by using integrated approaches that provide independent lines of evidence for taxonomic distinctiveness. We provide a formal redescription of the taxon newly raised to species level, Rhinolophus andamanensis Dobson, 1872."
https://openalex.org/W2979509009,"Several models for the long-term development of T2DM already exist, focusing on the dynamics of the interaction between glycemia, insulinemia and β-cell mass. Current models consider representative (fasting or daily average) glycemia and insulinemia as characterizing the compensation state of the subject at some instant in slow time. This implies that only these representative levels can be followed through time and that the role of fast glycemic oscillations is neglected. An improved model (DPM15) for the long-term progression of T2DM is proposed, introducing separate peripheral and hepatic (liver and kidney) insulin actions. The DPM15 model no longer uses near-equilibrium approximation to separate fast and slow time scales, but rather describes, at each step in slow time, a complete day in the life of the virtual subject in fast time. The model can thus represent both fasting and postprandial glycemic levels and describe the effect of interventions acting on insulin-enhanced tissue glucose disposal or on insulin-inhibited hepatic glucose output, as well as on insulin secretion and β-cell replicating ability. The model can simulate long-term variations of commonly used clinical indices (HOMA-B, HOMA-IR, insulinogenic index) as well as of Oral Glucose Tolerance or Euglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp test results. The model has been calibrated against observational data from the Diabetes Prevention Program study: it shows good adaptation to observations as a function of very plausible values of the parameters describing the effect of such interventions as Placebo, Intensive LifeStyle and Metformin administration."
https://openalex.org/W2980274743,"Plantar fasciitis is a frequently occurring overuse injury of the foot. Shoes with a stiff rocker profile are a commonly prescribed treatment modality used to alleviate complaints associated with plantar fasciitis. In rocker shoes the apex position was moved proximally as compared to normal shoes, limiting the progression of the ground reaction forces (GRF) and peak plantarflexion moments during gait. A stiff sole minimizes dorsiflexion of the toes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the biomechanical effects of rocker shoes lead to minimization of plantar aponeurosis (PA) strain during gait in patients with plantar fasciitis and in healthy young adults. 8 patients with plantar fasciitis (1 male, 7 females; mean age 55.0 ± 8.4 years) and 8 healthy young adults (8 females; mean age 24.1 ± 1.6 years) participated in the study. Each participant walked for 1 minute on an instrumented treadmill while wearing consecutively in random order shoes with a normal apex position (61.2 ± 2.8% apex) with flexible insole (FN), normal apex position with stiff insole (SN), proximal apex position (56.1 ± 2.6% apex) with flexible insole (FR) and proximal apex position with stiff insole (SR). Marker position data of the foot and lower leg and GRF were recorded. An OpenSim foot model was used to compute the change in PA length based on changes in foot segment positions during gait. The changes in PA length due to increases in Achilles tendon forces were computed based on previous data of a cadaver study. PA strain computed from both methods was not statistically different between shoe conditions. Peak Achilles tendon force, peak first metatarsophalangeal (MTP1) joint angle and peak plantarflexion moment were significantly lower when walking with the rocker shoe with a proximal apex position and a stiff insole for all subjects (p<.05). Changes in Achilles tendon forces during gait accounted for 65 ± 2% of the total PA strain. Rocker shoes with a stiff insole reduce peak dorsiflexion angles of the toes and plantar flexion moments, but not PA strain because the effects of a proximal apex position and stiff insole do not occur at the same time, but independently affect PA strain at 80-90% and 90-100% of the stance phase. Rocker shoes with an apex position of ~56% are insufficient to significantly reduce peak PA strain values in patients with plantar fasciitis and healthy young adults."
https://openalex.org/W2979485151,"Background Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal mortality in Nigeria and in most low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) strongly recommends oxytocin as effective, affordable, and the safest drug of first choice in the prevention and treatment of PPH in the third stage of labor. However, there are concerns about its quality. Very high prevalence of poor-quality oxytocin, especially in Africa and Asia, has been reported in literature. Excessive and inappropriate use of oxytocin is also common in low-resource settings. Objective To assess clinical experiences with quality of oxytocin used by healthcare providers in Lagos State, Nigeria. Methods This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in 2017, with 705 respondents (doctors and nurses) who use oxytocin for obstetrics and gynecological services recruited from 195 health facilities (public and registered private) across Lagos State. Data collection was quantitative, using a pretested self-administered questionnaire. Data analysis was performed with IBM SPSS version 21. Statistical significance was set at 5 percent (p<0.05). Ethical approval was obtained from Lagos University Teaching Hospital Health Research Ethics Committee. Results Only 52 percent of the respondents knew oxytocin should be stored at 2°C to 8°C. About 80 percent of respondents used oxytocin for augmentation of labor, 68 percent for induction of labor, 51 percent for stimulation of labor, and 78 percent for management of PPH. Forty-one percent used 20IU and as much as 10% used 30IU to 60IU for management of PPH. About 13 percent of respondents reported believing they had used an ineffective brand of oxytocin in their practice. Just over a third (36%) had an available means of documenting or reporting perceived ineffectiveness of drugs in their facility; of these, only about 12 percent had pharmacovigilance forms in their facilities to report the ineffectiveness. Conclusion The inappropriate and inconsistent use of oxytocin, especially overdosing, likely led to the high perception of medicine effectiveness among respondents. This is coupled with lack of suspicion of medicine ineffectiveness by clinicians as a possible root cause of poor treatment response or disease progression. Poor knowledge of oxytocin storage and consequent poor storage practices could have contributed to the ineffectiveness reported by some respondents. It is necessary to establish a unified protocol for oxytocin use that is strictly complied with. Continuous training of healthcare providers in medicine safety monitoring is advocated."
https://openalex.org/W2979949636,"Conjugated linoleic acid was detected in rabbit caecotrophs, due to the presence of microbial lipid activity in rabbit cecum. However, the effect of CLA as a functional food in growing rabbit is not well established. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of CLA on production, meat quality, and its nutrigenomic effect on edible parts of rabbit carcass including skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. Therefore, seventy five weaned V-Line male rabbits, 30 days old, were randomly allocated into three dietary treatments receiving either basal control diet, diet supplemented with 0.5% (CLAL), or 1% CLA (CLAH). Total experimental period (63 d) was segmented into 7 days adaptation and 56 days experimental period. Dietary supplementation of CLA did not alter growth performance, however, the fat percentage of longissimus lumborum muscle was decreased, with an increase in protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) percentage. Saturated fatty acids (SFA) and mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were not increased in CLA treated groups. There was tissue specific sensing of CLA, since subcutaneous adipose tissue gene expression of PPARA was downregulated, however, CPT1A tended to be upregulated in liver of CLAL group only (P = 0.09). In skeletal muscle, FASN and PPARG were upregulated in CLAH group only (P ≤0.01). Marked cytoplasmic vacuolation was noticed in liver of CLAH group without altering hepatocyte structure. Adipocyte size was decreased in CLA fed groups, in a dose dependent manner (P <0.01). Cell proliferation determined by PCNA was lower (P <0.01) in adipose tissue of CLA groups. Our data indicate that dietary supplementation of CLA (c9,t11-CLA and t10,c12- CLA) at a dose of 0.5% in growing rabbit diet produce rabbit meat rich in PUFA and lower fat % without altering growth performance and hepatocyte structure."
https://openalex.org/W2980011779,"The prefrontal cortex is central to higher order cognitive function. However, the cerebellum, generally thought to be involved in motor control and learning, has also been implicated in higher order cognition. Recent work using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) provides some support for right cerebellar involvement in higher order cognition, though the results are mixed, and often contradictory. Here, we used cathodal high definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) over the right cerebellum to assess the impact of HD-tDCS on modulating cognitive performance. We predicted that stimulation would result in performance decreases, which would suggest that optimal cerebellar function is necessary for cognitive performance, much like the prefrontal cortex. That is, it is not simply a structure that lends support to complete difficult tasks. While the expected cognitive behavioral effects were present, we did not find effects of stimulation. This has broad implications for cerebellar tDCS research, particularly for those who are interested in using HD-tDCS as a way of examining cerebellar function. Further implications, limitations, and future directions are discussed with particular emphasis on why null findings might be critical in developing a clear picture of the effects of tDCS on the cerebellum."
https://openalex.org/W2979510941,"The second WW domain (WW2) of the kidney and brain scaffolding protein, KIBRA, has an isoleucine (Ile-81) rather than a second conserved tryptophan and is primarily unstructured. However, it adopts the canonical triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet structure of WW domains when bound to a two-PPXY motif peptide of the synaptic protein Dendrin. Here, using a series of biophysical experiments, we demonstrate that the WW2 domain remains largely disordered when bound to a 69-residue two-PPXY motif polypeptide of the synaptic and podocyte protein synaptopodin (SYNPO). Isothermal titration calorimetry and CD experiments revealed that the interactions of the disordered WW2 domain with SYNPO are significantly weaker than SYNPO's interactions with the well-folded WW1 domain and that an I81W substitution in the WW2 domain neither enhances binding affinity nor induces substantial WW2 domain folding. In the tandem polypeptide, the two WW domains synergized, enhancing the overall binding affinity with the I81W variant tandem polypeptide 2-fold compared with the WT polypeptide. Solution NMR results showed that SYNPO binding induces small but definite chemical shift perturbations in the WW2 domain, confirming the disordered state of the WW2 domain in this complex. These analyses also disclosed that SYNPO binds the tandem WW domain polypeptide in an antiparallel manner, that is, the WW1 domain binds the second PPXY motif of SYNPO. We propose a binding model consisting of a bipartite interaction mode in which the largely disordered WW2 forms a “fuzzy” complex with SYNPO.

It results in poor seed quality and reduced seed lot market grade, and thus undermines value of soybean worldwide. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the reaction of selected soybean genotypes collected from 15 countries representing maturity groups (MGs) III, IV, and V to PSS, and to identify new sources of resistance to PSS based on three years of evaluation of natural field infection by Cercospora spp. in the Mississippi Delta of the U. S. In this study, 42 soybean genotypes were evaluated in 2010, 2011, and 2012. Seventeen lines including six MG III (PI 88490, PI 504488, PI 417361, PI 548298, PI 437482, and PI 578486), seven MG IV (PI 404173, PI 346308, PI 355070, PI 416779, PI 80479, PI 346307, and PI 264555), and four MG V (PI 417567, PI 417420, PI 381659, and PI 407749) genotypes had significantly lower percent seed infection by Cercospora spp. than the susceptible checks and other genotypes evaluated (P ≤ 0.05). These genotypes of soybean can be used in developing soybean cultivars or germplasm lines with resistance to PSS and for genetic mapping of PSS resistance genes. In addition, among these 17 lines with different levels of resistance to PSS, nine soybean genotypes (PI 417361, PI 504488, PI 88490, PI 346308, PI 416779, PI 417567, PI 381659, PI 417567, and PI 407749) were previously reported as resistant to Phomopsis seed decay.

https://openalex.org/W2980113640,"Fertility in Ghana has declined steadily since 1980, however, a slight increase was observed between 2008 and 2014. While several factors may account for this pattern, research on the contribution of type of union is limited. This study examined differentials in the fertility of women in different types of union. Secondary data from 6,285 (weighted) ever-married women aged 15–49 years were analysed using compare means, t-test, analysis of variance, Poisson and binary logistic regression analyses. The findings indicate that, independent of other factors, fertility among remarried women is higher compared to first-time married women but this does not hold true when other factors are controlled for. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the fertility of remarried women who were in union and women who were in union in a first-time marriage. However, compared to remarried women who were currently in a union, fertility was significantly lower among remarried women who were not currently in union (β = -0.121, p<0.01) and women who have been married only once but were not currently in union (β = -0.212, p<0.001). Further analysis revealed that remarried women were significantly more likely to desire more children and less likely to use any method of contraception compared to first-time married women. There is the need for further research to better understand the fertility needs of remarried women."
https://openalex.org/W2980171969,"In recent years, with the development of computer science, deep learning is held as competent enough to solve the problem of inference and learning in high dimensional space. Therefore, it has received unprecedented attention from both the academia and the business community. Compared with CPU/GPU, FPGA has attracted much attention for its high-energy efficiency, short development cycle and reconfigurability in the aspect of deep learning algorithm. However, because of the limited research on OpenCL optimization on FPGA of deep learning algorithms, OpenCL tools and models applied to CPU/GPU cannot be directly used on FPGA. This makes it difficult for software programmers to use FPGA when implementing deep learning algorithms for a rewarding performance. To solve this problem, this paper proposed an OpenCL computational model based on FPGA template architecture to optimize the time-consuming convolution layer in deep learning. The comparison between the program applying the computational model and the corresponding optimization program provided by Xilinx indicates that the former is 8-40 times higher than the latter in terms of performance."
https://openalex.org/W2979603052,"Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of breast MRI for detecting residual tumor and the tumor size whether it would be affected after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods Total 109 patients with NAC and 682 patients without NAC were included in this retrospective study. Measurement of the largest diameter of tumors at pathology was chosen as gold standard and compared with preoperative breast MRI. A concordance threshold of ±25% of maximal tumor size was used. The accuracy of MRI was graded as concordant, underestimation, or overestimation rate. Further subgroup analysis with tumor stages, histologic subgroups and intrinsic subtypes was performed. Results The post-NAC MRI was associated with 92.5% sensitivity, 55.2% specificity, 85.1% positive predictive value, 72.7% negative predictive value, and overall 82.6% accuracy for detecting residual tumor. In determining tumor size, the overall concordance rates of the non-NAC group and the NAC group were 43.5% and 41.3%, respectively (p = 0.678). But the overestimation rate and underestimation rate were 26.6% and 32.1% for NAC group, and 52.9% and 3.5% for the non-NAC group (p<0.001). While in the subgroups analysis, the concordance rate of the NAC group (26.7%) was lower than that of the non-NAC group (82.1%) at T3 stage (p<0.001). There were no statistically significant differences between different tumor histologic subgroups and intrinsic subtypes. Conclusions The overall accuracy of MRI in predicting tumor size was not affected by NAC; however, it tends to underestimate tumor size after NAC, especially in patients with T3 lesions and above."

It is significant to note that a majority of membrane protein structures show evidence of well-ordered lipid headgroups (29Palsdottir H. Hunte C. Lipids in membrane protein structures.Biochim.

In contrast, the cytochrome b6f crystal structure (PDB code 4OGQ) shows electron density mainly for the hydrophobic fatty acid tails (5Hasan S.S. Cramer W.A. Internal lipid architecture of the hetero-oligomeric cytochrome b6f complex.Structure. 2014; 22 (24931468): 1008-101510.1016/j.str.2014.05.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, the high-resolution crystallographic data (i.e. better than 3.0-Å resolution) of delipidated cytochrome b6f complex was achieved by augmentation of delipidated cytochrome b6f with pure, synthetic lipid, DOPC or DOPG. The fact that high-resolution structural data on the cytochrome b6f complex was obtained in an artificial lipid environment might imply that structural stability and function of the cytochrome b6f complex depends on the lipid environment of the multisubunit membrane protein complex. In the present study, we have used dilinolenoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (DLPG) with an 18:3 carbon side chain that mimics the native lipid found in the thylakoid membrane (31van Eerden F.J. de Jong D.H. de Vries A.H. Wassenaar T.A. Marrink S.J. Characterization of thylakoid lipid membranes from cyanobacteria and higher plants by molecular dynamics simulations.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1848 (25749153): 1319-133010.1016/j.bbamem.2015.02.025Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) alongside MGDG, DGDG, SQDG, and the synthetic lipids DOPC and DOPG. The present study shows that lipid hydrophobic tail groups contribute significantly to the structural stability of the complex. The synthetic lipids DOPC and DOPG and native DLPG and SQDG are approximately equivalent in their ability to stabilize the secondary and tertiary structure of the cytochrome complex. In contrast, the galactolipids MGDG and DGDG do not cause significant stabilization of the complex as seen by far-UV CD. Incorporation of the complex in (a) nanodiscs composed of DOPC and DOPG (3:1) and (b) bicelles (DMPC:CHAPSO = 0.5) stabilized the secondary structure of the b6f complex purified from Spinacea. Although phosphatidylcholine (PC) is not present in the native plant thylakoid membrane, synthetic PC-containing fatty acyl chains mimicking the native hydrophobic environment stabilize the structure of the complex. The native thylakoid membrane sulfolipid SQDG has a significant role in the dimer stabilization of the complex. Although significant removal of bound phospholipids substantially inactivates the cytochrome complex, subsequent addition of DLPG to the deactivated complex can restore almost complete activity of the complex. In comparison, the 18:1 DOPG can restore the activity of the complex by a factor of 1.6-fold, thus implicating the anionic phospholipid PG as essential for native activity of the b6f complex. The secondary structure content of the b6f complex from Nostoc (PDB code 4OGQ) is 45.1% α-helix and 12.6% β-strand (Table 3). The unfolding of the cytochrome complex, as a function of temperature in the presence and absence of lipid, was studied by monitoring the change in molar ellipticity, at a wavelength of 222 nm, of the peak in the far-UV spectrum for α-helical secondary structure (32Holzwarth G. Doty P. The ultraviolet circular dichroism of polypeptides.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 87 (14228459): 218-22810.1021/ja01080a015Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). At this wavelength, the extinction coefficient of the β-strand structure is approximately a third of that for α-helix (33Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Computed circular dichroism spectra for the evaluation of protein conformation.Biochemistry. 1969; 8 (5346390): 4108-411610.1021/bi00838a031Crossref PubMed Scopus (3319) Google Scholar). An overlay of the thermal denaturation spectra of the cytochrome–detergent complex in the presence of DOPG, DOPC, and SQDG (Fig. 1B) reveals an increase in thermal stability of the complex in the presence of lipid. The midpoint of the transition, Tm, was determined more precisely from the first derivative of the “melting curve” as a function of temperature (Fig. 1, B, inset, and C). The addition of the native (DLPG and SQDG) and synthetic lipids (DOPG and DOPC) stabilized the structure as indicated by the shift of the Tm to higher temperatures (Table 4). However, the addition of the native galactolipids MGDG and DGDG did not cause any significant stabilization (Fig. 1C and Table 4).Table 3Secondary structure content of the b6f complex from Nostoc sp.

DLPG, palmitoyl-oleoyl-PG (POPG), and DOPG increased the Tm of the complex comparably (63.7, 63.8, and 64.4 °C, respectively) (Table 4). However, POPC displayed a larger stabilizing effect on the cytochrome complex than DOPC (Table 4). The increase in structure stabilization by PC, which is not native to the thylakoid membrane, is attributed to its hydrophobic fatty acid acyl chains. The structure stabilization provided by the native lipids DGDG and SQDG, as well as the synthetic lipids DOPG and DOPC, could be reproduced by differential scanning calorimetry, where the enthalpy of unfolding (ΔH) and the melting temperatures (Tm) of the b6f complex were measured (Fig. 2 and Table 5).Table 5Comparison of the enthalpies and melting temperatures (Tm) of the delipidated cytochrome b6f complex and in the presence of DOPG, DOPC, DGDG, and SQDGCyt b6fTmEnthalpy, ΔH°CkJ/molUDM62.8115.3UDM + DOPC63.1220.0UDM + DOPG64.5170.6UDM + SQDG64.6218.2UDM61.4271.3UDM + DGDG61.4340 Open table in a new tab Addition of each of the four lipids significantly increased the enthalpy associated with the unfolding of the cytochrome complex. Although the increase in Tm in the presence of DGDG and DOPC is not significant, a large increase in the enthalpy change, associated with the unfolding of the protein complex, might indicate a mechanism of stabilization that is different from that caused by the anionic lipids DOPG and SQDG. Deconvoluted DSC thermograms showed three distinct transition peaks (Fig. 3), suggesting that the thermal denaturation of the cytochrome complex occurs via three distinct domain unfolding events whose molecular basis is currently not understood. It is evident that the Tm for the three transitions is shifted to higher temperatures in the presence of lipid (Table 6). Removal of internally bound phospholipid which copurifies with the cytochrome b6f complex by phospholipase A2 (which cleaves the sn-2 bond of phospholipids) did not affect the Tm of the complex significantly, as determined by the temperature dependence of the amplitude of the CD spectrum at 222 nm (Table 7).Table 6Comparison of the Tm of the three transitions (1, 2, and 3) obtained from deconvolution of the DSC thermograms for the cytochrome b6f complex in the presence of DOPG, DOPC, and SQDGCyt b6fDelipidatedDelipidated + DOPGDelipidated + DOPCDelipidated + SQDGDelipidated + DGDGTmEnthalpyTmEnthalpyTmEnthalpyTmEnthalpyTmEnthalpy°CkJ/mol°CkJ/mol°CkJ/mol°CkJ/mol°CkJ/molTransition 1 (magenta)60.81662.96061.15363.612959.114Transition 2 (blue)62.67364.88462.912165.46161.5159Transition 3 (green)64.33266.53164.75666.92863.448 Open table in a new tab Table 7Comparison of the melting temperatures (Tm) of the delipidated cytochrome b6f complex before and after addition of phospholipase A2, measured by far-UV CDCyt b6f complexTm°CUDM-solubilized62.1 ± 0.25Phospholipase A261.6 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab Stabilization of the b6f complex by the hydrophobicity of the lipid bilayer was observed when the cytochrome complex was incorporated into more native environments associated with nanodiscs and bicelles. Successful reconstitution of the b6f complex in nanodiscs was confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography in which the cytochrome complex in nanodiscs elutes earlier as a consequence of its larger molecular weight (data not shown). A comparison was made of the thermal melting stability of the cytochrome complex, studied by far-UV CD at 222 nm, incorporated into nanodiscs and phospholipid bicelles. The denaturation profiles of the b6f complex in nanodiscs and bicelles reveal a larger increase in the Tm of the b6f complex by 7.3 and 5.9 °C, respectively (Fig. 4 and Table 8), when compared with the complex in lipid micelles, implying significant stabilization. The first derivative of the thermal denaturation curve, utilized to more accurately define the temperature associated with the maximum rate of melting for b6f in nanodiscs (Fig. 4, blue) shows a residual signal between 20 and 50 °C, caused by the presence of the α-helical membrane-spanning protein belt around the nanodisc, which has a broad melting profile in that temperature range (Fig. 4, brown function). These results suggest that the hydrophobic environment of the membrane systems, defined mainly by the nonnative PC lipids, with tail groups closely mimicking those of the thylakoid lipids in terms of length and degree of unsaturation, is sufficient to increase the structural stability of the b6f complex.Table 8Comparison of the melting temperatures (Tm) of the cytochrome b6f complex in UDM and in the presence of nanodiscs and bicelles, measured by far UV-CDCyt b6f complexTm°CUDM-solubilized62.1 ± 0.25Bicelle68.2 ± 0.7Nanodisc69.6 ± 0.34 Open table in a new tab The effect of different lipids on the thermal stability of the b6f dimeric complex was determined by heating the protein complex in the presence and absence of lipids as described earlier and subsequently displaying the complex on 4–12% clear native PAGE (Fig. 5A). The monomer-to-dimer ratio for each sample on the native gel was calculated using densitometry analyses using ImageJ software (34Schneider C.A. Rasband W.S. Eliceiri K.W.

We use stochastic dominance to quantify the effect of GM traits on the entire distribution of yields in corn in the USA under a wide range of growing conditions. Although no GM hybrid outperforms conventional hybrids under all growing conditions, we present evidence that most GM hybrids can be considered as improvements of the yield distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2979779337,"Aberrant activation of the JAK/STAT pathway is thought to be the critical event in the pathogenesis of the chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis. The most frequent genetic alteration in these pathologies is the activating JAK2V617F mutation, and expression of the mutant gene in mouse models was shown to cause a phenotype resembling the human diseases. Given the body of genetic evidence, it has come as a sobering finding that JAK inhibitor therapy only modestly suppresses the JAK2V617F allele burden, despite showing clear benefits in terms of reducing splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms in patients. To gain a better understanding if JAK2V617F is required for maintenance of myeloproliferative disease once it has evolved, we generated a conditional inducible transgenic JAK2V617F mouse model using the SCL-tTA-2S tet-off system. Our model corroborates that expression of JAK2V617F in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells recapitulates key hallmarks of human myeloproliferative neoplasms, and exhibits gender differences in disease manifestation. The disease was found to be transplantable, and importantly, reversible when transgenic JAK2V617F expression was switched off. Our results indicate that mutant JAK2V617F-specific inhibitors should result in profound disease modification by disabling the myeloproliferative clone bearing mutant JAK2."
https://openalex.org/W2980040036,"The problem of handling non-ignorable non-response has been typically addressed under the design-based approach using the well-known sub-sampling technique introduced by Hansen and Hurwitz [1946, Journal of the American Statistical Association, Vol 41(236), Page 517- 529]. Alternatively, the model-based paradigm emphasizes on utilizing the underlying model relationship between the outcome variable and one or more covariate(s) whose population values are known prior to the survey. This article utilizes the model relationship between the study variable and covariate(s) for handling non-ignorable non-response and obtaining an unbiased estimator for the population total under the sub-sampling technique. The main idea is to combine the estimates obtained from the sample on first call and the sub-sample from second call using separate model relationships. The contribution of this paper helps us in providing unbiased estimates with an improved efficiency under model-based paradigm in presence of non-ignorable non-response. The provided method is more economical than the available estimators under callback methods as we are working sub-sampling and also increase response rate as a stronger mode of interview is employed for data collection. A numerical study using Monte Carlo is presented to illustrate the behavior of the proposed and the efficiency comparison."

However, data is scarce on the disease burden and outcomes following admission in this population. We herein describe the pattern of diagnoses, outcomes and factors associated with the outcomes among elderly patients admitted at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) and Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute (JKCI) medical wards.From October to December 2017, we consecutively enrolled patients aged ≥60 years (elderly) admitted to the MNH and JKCI medical wards. The ICD 10 was used to code for disease diagnosis at discharge or death. The Modified Barthel index was used to assess for functional activity on admission and at discharge.We enrolled 336 (30.1%) elderly participants out of 1301 medical admissions. The mean age ± SD was 70.6 ± 8.9 years; 169 (50%) were female and the average number of diagnoses was 2 per participant. The most common diagnoses were: hypertension 151 (44.9%), stroke 106 (31.5%), heart failure 62 (18.5%), pneumonia 60 (17.9%), diabetes mellitus 58 (17.3%) and chronic kidney disease 55 (16.4%). The median duration of hospital stay was 5 (IQR 3-10) days and in-hospital mortality was 86 (25.6%), 56 (65%) deaths were due to non-communicable diseases and 48 (55.8%) deaths occurred within 72 hours of hospitalization. A modified Barthel score ≤20 on admission was associated with an OR 15.43 (95% CI: 7.5-31.7, p<0.001) for death.Elderly patients constituted a significant proportion of medical admissions at MNH and JKCI with high in-hospital mortality. A modified Barthel index score ≤20 during admission is associated with mortality and can be used to identify patients requiring special attention."
https://openalex.org/W2979358474,"The development of automatic methods for segmenting anatomy from medical images is an important goal for many medical and healthcare research areas. Datasets that can be used to train and test computer algorithms, however, are often small due to the difficulties in obtaining experts to segment enough examples. Citizen science provides a potential solution to this problem but the feasibility of using the public to identify and segment anatomy in a medical image has not been investigated. Our study therefore aimed to explore the feasibility, in terms of performance and motivation, of using citizens for such purposes. Public involvement was woven into the study design and evaluation. Twenty-nine citizens were recruited and, after brief training, asked to segment the spine from a dataset of 150 magnetic resonance images. Participants segmented as many images as they could within three one-hour sessions. Their accuracy was evaluated by comparing them, as individuals and as a combined consensus, to the segmentations of three experts. Questionnaires and a focus group were used to determine the citizens’ motivation for taking part and their experience of the study. Citizen segmentation accuracy, in terms of agreement with the expert consensus segmentation, varied considerably between individual citizens. The citizen consensus, however, was close to the expert consensus, indicating that when pooled, citizens may be able to replace or supplement experts for generating large image datasets. Personal interest and a desire to help were the two most common reasons for taking part in the study."
https://openalex.org/W2979819053,"To enable selection of a safer suspension site to use in face and neck lifting procedures, the spatial relationship between the tympanoparotid fascia and the great auricular nerve should be clarified. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the position of the tympanoparotid fascia and the pathway of the lobular branch of the great auricular nerve traversing the tympanoparotid fascia. Twenty hemifaces from non-preserved bequeathed Korean cadavers (5 males, 7 females; mean age, 77.0 years) were dissected to determine the great auricular nerve distribution close to the tympanoparotid fascia of clinical significance for face and neck lift procedures. We observed the tympanoparotid fascia in all specimens (20 hemifaces). The tympanoparotid fascia was located anteriorly between the tragus and intertragic notch. Regarding the spatial relationship between the tympanoparotid fascia and the great auricular nerve, we found the sensory nerve entering the tympanoparotid fascia in all specimens (100%), and the depth from the skin was approximately 4.5 mm; in 65% of the specimens, the lobular branch was found to run close to the tympanoparotid fascia before going into the earlobe. Provided with relatively safer surface mapping to access the tympanoparotid fascia free of the lobular branch of the great auricular nerve, surgeons may better protect the lobular branch by anchoring the SMAS-platysma flap and thread to the deeper superior and anterior portions of the expected tympanoparotid fascia."
https://openalex.org/W2979898024,"Hindsight bias (HB) is the tendency to retrospectively exaggerate one’s foresight knowledge about the outcome of an event. Cognitive processes influenced by newly obtained outcome information are used to explain the HB phenomenon, but the neural correlates remain unknown. This study investigated HB in the context of election results using a memory design and functional magnetic resonance imaging for the first time. Participants were asked to predict and recall the percentage of votes obtained by (pairs of) candidates before and after an election. The results revealed that 88% of participants showed HB by recalling that their predictions were closer to the actual outcomes than they really were; and participants had HB for 38% of the events. The HB effect was associated with activation in the medial superior frontal gyrus and bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), which have been implicated in updating an old belief due to new information and is similar to the process of reconstruction bias. Furthermore, participants with a greater HB effect showed greater activation of the left IFG. In conclusion, we successfully observed the HB phenomenon in election results, and our imaging results suggested that the HB phenomenon might involve reconstruction bias."
