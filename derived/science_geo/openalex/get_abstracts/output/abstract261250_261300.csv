For most, it is unclear whether shifts from one state to another would be helpful or harmful. We used mutagenesis to change the assembly state of Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. In vitro, the “Arctic” mutation (AβE22G) accelerated Aβ fibrillization but decreased the abundance of nonfibrillar Aβ assemblies, compared with wild-type Aβ. In human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice carrying mutations adjacent to Aβ that increase Aβ production, addition of the Arctic mutation markedly enhanced the formation of neuritic amyloid plaques but reduced the relative abundance of a specific nonfibrillar Aβ assembly (Aβ*56). Mice overexpressing Arctic mutant or wild-type Aβ had similar behavioral and neuronal deficits when they were matched for Aβ*56 levels but had vastly different plaque loads. Thus, Aβ*56 is a likelier determinant of functional deficits in hAPP mice than fibrillar Aβ deposits. Therapeutic interventions that reduce Aβ fibrils at the cost of augmenting nonfibrillar Aβ assemblies could be harmful.

Much evidence suggests that this association reflects a causal relationship in which the abnormal proteins actually trigger the neuronal dysfunction and degeneration that characterize these conditions (1Walsh D.M.

The prevalence of AD and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies is increasing rapidly around the world, most likely because of their age dependence, the increasing longevity of many populations, and the lack of effective strategies for treatment and prevention (4Hebert L.

This alarming trend underlines the need to better understand the relationship between the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the CNS and the decline of neurological function. This relationship has been difficult to analyze in depth because proteins associated with neurodegenerative disorders can exist in diverse assembly states, and distinct assemblies can differ markedly in pathogenic potential. For example, the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, which seems to play a causal role in AD, can exist as monomers, low molecular weight oligomers (such as dimers and trimers), larger globular oligomers (such as Aβ*56, Aβ-derived diffusible ligands, amylospheroids, and globulomers), amyloid pores, protofibrils, fibrils, and amyloid plaques that contain densely packed Aβ fibrils and a large number of other molecules and cellular elements (7Roher A.E.

Which of these structures contributes most critically to neurological decline in AD is a matter of active study and debate that has important implications for therapeutic interventions. Studies of transgenic mice with neuronal expression of human amyloid precursor proteins (hAPP), from which Aβ is released by proteolytic cleavage, suggest that nonfibrillar Aβ assemblies are more critical than amyloid plaques in the pathogenesis of AD-related neuronal dysfunction and memory deficits (15Lesné S.

Pike C.J. Shankle R. Cotman C.W. Neurobiol. Aging. 1996; 17: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 22Knowles R.B. Gomez-Isla T. Hyman B.T. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4535-4540Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Shifting Aβ from one assembly state to another may have profound effects on the pathogenesis of AD. Such shifts can result from genetic alterations and pharmacological interventions that change the amino acid composition of Aβ. For example, increasing the abundance of Aβ1–42 relative to shorter Aβ species promotes aggregation of Aβ monomers and plaque formation (25Younkin S.G. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 287-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), whereas increasing the relative abundance of Aβ1–40 appears to counteract these processes (18Mucke L. Masliah E. Yu G.-Q.

Mutations within the Aβ sequence that cause AD or related conditions also have marked effects on the assembly of Aβ (28Chiti F. Stefani M. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 424: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The current study focuses on a familial AD-linked point mutation within Aβ (E22G, “Arctic mutation”) that accelerates the aggregation of Aβ into protofibrils and fibrils in vitro (29Nilsberth C.

We investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) how the Arctic mutation affects the balance between fibrillar and nonfibrillar Aβ assemblies in cell-free conditions and compared its effect on the relative abundance of neuritic amyloid plaques and nonfibrillar Aβ assemblies in brain tissues of hAPP mice. Lastly, we examined whether behavioral deficits and depletions of synaptic activity-related proteins in these mice relate more closely to plaques or nonfibrillar Aβ assemblies. Ex Situ AFM—Wild-type (wt) and Arctic mutant synthetic Aβ1–42 (Biopeptide, San Diego, CA) were dissolved in 100% 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP; Sigma) to 0.5 mg/ml and dried under vacuum. The HFIP-treated peptides were resuspended to 5 mg/ml in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. This stock solution was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml and agitated at 1000 rpm at 37 °C. An aliquot from each sample was taken at various time intervals for immediate deposition. Aβ*56 was purified from forebrains of Tg2576 mice by immunoaffinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography as described (15Lesné S. MT K. Kotilinek L. Kayed R. Glabe C.G. Yang A. Gallagher M. Ashe K.H. Nature. 2006; 440: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). Three 5-μl samples of each incubation solution were deposited on freshly cleaved mica (SPI, West Chester, PA) and allowed to sit for 30 s. The substrate was washed twice with 100 μl of ultra-pure water, and the sample was then dried under a gentle stream of air. Tapping-mode AFM in air was performed with a Nanoscope IIIa system (Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with a vertical-engage E scanner. Standard etched silicon probes (nominal spring constant, 50 N/m; resonance frequency, 300 kHz) were used. Typically, the following imaging parameters were used: drive amplitude of 150–500 kHz with set points of 0.8–1.0 V, scan frequencies of 4–5 Hz, image resolution of 512 by 512 points, and scan sizes of 3–12 μm. Custom software was used for AFM image analysis (35Legleiter J. Czilli D.L. Gitter B. DeMattos R.B. Holtzman D.M. Kowalewski T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Volume measurements were corrected for lateral tip contributions as described (36Legleiter J. DeMattos R.B. Holtzman D.M. Kowalewski T. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 2004; 278: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For image quantification, nonfibrillar Aβ assemblies (oligomers and protofibrils) were defined as any structure with a height of 1–6 nm and a width to length (aspect) ratio smaller than 2.5. Fibrillar Aβ assemblies (fibrils and larger aggregates) were defined as any structure with a height larger than 6 nm and an aspect ratio of 2.5 or above. The ratio of nonfibrillar to fibrillar Aβ in Fig. 1D was calculated from the percent area occupied by each type of Aβ assembly as defined above. In Situ AFM—In situ AFM experiments were performed with a Nanoscope IIIa MultiMode scanning probe microscope equipped with a fluid cell and a vertical engage E-scanner. Images were taken with a V-shaped oxide-sharpened silicon nitride cantilever with a nominal spring constant of 0.5 N/m. Scan rates were set at 1–3 Hz with cantilever drive frequencies of ∼8–10 kHz. Freshly cleaved mica substrates were used, and phosphate-buffered saline was added to the cell in 35-μl aliquots by the hanging-drop method. Once the cantilever had successfully engaged the surface, a 15-μl aliquot of freshly made 1000 μg/ml Aβ-Wt or Aβ-Arctic was injected into the fluid cell, resulting in a final concentration of 300 μg/ml. Experimental Animals—Artic-mutant hAPP (ARC) lines were generated in C57BL/6N mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) and crossed onto the C57BL/6J background (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) for 6–8 generations (34Cheng I. Palop J. Esposito L. Bien-Ly N. Yan F. Mucke L. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1190-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The J20 line was generated in C57BL/6 x DBA/2 hybrids (18Mucke L. Masliah E. Yu G.-Q. Mallory M. Rockenstein E.M. Tatsuno G. Hu K. Kholodenko D. Johnson-Wood K. McConlogue L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4050-4058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and crossed onto the C57BL/6J background for more than 10 generations. Most results were compared with results in nontransgenic (NTG) littermates from each line to control for any line-specific effects. Unless indicated otherwise, mice were analyzed at 3–4 months of age. The studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, San Francisco, and conducted in compliance with the National Institutes of Health’s “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.” Behavioral Tests—Two independent, genotype- and line-balanced cohorts of singly housed male mice and NTG littermate controls from lines J20, ARC6, and ARC48 (n = 9–13/group) were tested in the sequence of elevated plus maze, open field, Y maze, and Morris water maze. The experimenter was blind to line and genotype during testing. Open Field—Activity in the open field was tested with the automated Flex-Field/Open Field Photobeam Activity System (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA). The system consisted of two identical clear plastic chambers (41 × 41 × 38 cm), a PAS control box, a PC interface board, and a microcomputer for recording and analysis of data. Two sensor frames, each consisting of a 16 × 16 photobeam array at 1.5 cm and 6 cm above the bottom of the cage, were used to detect movements in the horizontal and vertical planes. The test was initiated by placing the mouse in the center of the arena. Horizontal beam breaks (ambulatory moves) in the arena were counted over 15 min. The arena was cleaned and dried after each test. Y-Maze—The Y-maze was constructed of black plastic walls (10 cm high). It consisted of three compartments (10 cm × 10 cm) connected with 4 cm × 5 cm passages. The mouse was placed in one of the compartments and allowed to move freely for 6 min. An arm entry was manually recorded when all four paws entered the compartment. After each test, the maze was thoroughly cleaned. Elevated Plus Maze—The elevated plus-shaped maze consisted of two open arms and two closed arms equipped with rows of infrared photobeams (Hamilton-Kinder, Poway, CA). Mice were habituated to dim lighting in the testing room for 30 min and then were placed individually at the center of the apparatus and allowed to explore for 10 min. The time spent and distance traveled in each of the arms were recorded by infrared beam breaks. After each mouse was tested, the apparatus was thoroughly cleaned. Morris Water Maze—The water maze consisted of a pool (122 cm in diameter) containing opaque water (18 °C) and a platform (14 cm in diameter) submerged 1.5 cm under the water. For cued training sessions (days 1–3), the platform was marked with a visible beacon, and the mice were trained to locate the platform over six sessions (two per day, 4 h apart) each with two trials. The platform location was changed for each session. Hidden platform training (days 4–8) consisted of 10 sessions (two per day, 4 h apart), each with three trials. The platform location remained constant in the hidden platform sessions, and the entry points were changed semirandomly between trials. The maximum trial time was 60 s. Mice that failed to find the platform were led to it and placed on it for 15 s. A day after the last hidden platform training session, a probe trial was conducted by removing the platform and allowing mice to search in the pool for 1 min. Time to reach the platform, time in target quadrant, platform crossings, path length, and swim speed were recorded with an EthoVision video tracking system (Noldus, Netherlands). Immunoblotting and Immunohistochemistry—Mice were sacrificed 2 days after behavioral testing, and their brains were cut in half sagittally. One half was fixed for 48 h in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemical analysis, and the other was frozen in dry ice for biochemical analysis. To measure total Aβ1-x and Aβ1–42, snap-frozen forebrains were homogenized in 5 m guanidine buffer, and human Aβ peptides were quantitated by ELISA as described (18Mucke L. Masliah E. Yu G.-Q. Mallory M. Rockenstein E.M. Tatsuno G. Hu K. Kholodenko D. Johnson-Wood K. McConlogue L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4050-4058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein fractionation and Aβ*56 detection in hAPP mice were performed as described (15Lesné S. MT K. Kotilinek L. Kayed R. Glabe C.G. Yang A. Gallagher M. Ashe K.H. Nature. 2006; 440: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). Briefly, total proteins (100 μg) from the radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA) soluble fraction were separated on 10.5–20% Tricine gels or 4–12% Bis-Tris gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 μm pore size, Bio-Rad). Biotinylated 6E10 antibody (1:1000, Signet, Dedham, MA) and ExtrAvidin (1:5000, Sigma) were used for Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described (20Palop J.J. Jones B. Kekonius L. Chin J. Yu G.-Q. Raber J. Masliah E. Mucke L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9572-9577Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) on floating 30-μm sliding microtome sections with anti-Aβ (3D6, 1:500, Elan Pharmaceuticals, South San Francisco, CA), anti-APP (8E5, 1:1000, Elan Pharmaceuticals), anti-Fos (Ab-5, 1:10,000, Calbiochem) or anti-calbindin (1:15,000; Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland) antibodies. Diaminobenzidine was used as the chromagen. Images were acquired with a digital camera (Axiocam, Carl Zeiss). Densitometric quantification of calbindin immunoreactivity was performed with Bioquant (20Palop J.J. Jones B. Kekonius L. Chin J. Yu G.-Q. Raber J. Masliah E. Mucke L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9572-9577Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). For double-labeling of amyloid plaques and dystrophic neurites, floating sections were stained with monoclonal anti-hAPP antibody (8E5, 1:1000, Elan Pharmaceuticals), mounted on glass slides, and stained with 0.015% thioflavin-S. Images were collected with a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS11 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) or Statview (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Quantitative data are reported as mean ± S.E. Pairs of means were compared by unpaired two-tailed t test and multiple means by ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer posthoc test. Learning curves in the water maze were analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA. Differences in survival curves were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Correlations were examined by simple regression analysis. The Arctic Mutation Markedly Increases the Ratio of Fibrillar to Nonfibrillar Aβ in Vitro—Whereas it is well established that Aβ-Arctic aggregates more quickly than Aβ-Wt (29Nilsberth C. Westlind-Danielsson A. Eckman C.B. Condron M.M. Axelman K. Forsell C. Stenh C. Luthman J. Teplow D.B. Younkin S.G. Naslund J. Lannfelt L. Nat.

FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2618-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the specific aggregates formed and their ratios have, to our knowledge, not yet been analyzed by AFM. This technique provides quantitative three-dimensional morphological information unavailable with other approaches, such as analytical ultracentrifugation or dye-binding experiments. We first used in situ AFM to monitor the early events of synthetic Aβ1–42 assembly in real time under cell-free conditions as described (45Kowalewski T. Holtzman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). At a solution concentration of 62.5 μm, Aβ-Wt assembled predominantly into globular oligomers, which first appeared after 10 min and continuously increased in number during a 2-h incubation period (Fig. 1A, upper panel and Movie S1 in Supplemental Data). At the same concentration, Aβ-Arctic assembled into short rod-shaped protofibrils in less than 1 h (Fig. 1A, lower panel and Movie S2 in Supplemental Data), in agreement with previous reports that the Arctic mutation accelerates the formation of Aβ protofibrils (29Nilsberth C. Westlind-Danielsson A. Eckman C.B. Condron M.M. Axelman K. Forsell C. Stenh C. Luthman J. Teplow D.B. Younkin S.G. Naslund J. Lannfelt L. Nat.

FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2618-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The globular Aβ-Wt oligomers were 4–5 nm in height, mobile on mica, and coalesced into extended aggregates with segmented morphologies and often high curvature (Fig. S1, A and B in Supplemental Data), consistent with earlier findings (45Kowalewski T. Holtzman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In contrast, Aβ-Arctic protofibrils were 4.5–5.5 nm in height, had a more rigid morphology, were often highly branched, and formed highly ordered arrays along the crystallographic lattice of the mica surface (Fig. S1, C and D in Supplemental Data). Aβ-Arctic protofibrils did not grow from an obvious oligomeric precursor on the mica surface, although we cannot exclude the possibility that these structures may have formed transiently in solution before deposition. To quantify the levels of various structural assemblies of Aβ that accumulate over longer periods of time, Aβ samples at lower concentration (20.8 μm) were allowed to aggregate in test tubes at 37 °C before ex situ analysis by AFM (35Legleiter J.

The majority of Aβ-Wt assemblies that appeared within 48 h of incubation were globular oligomers (1–2.5 nm in height) and short rod-shaped protofibrils (3–5 nm in height), whereas elongated fibrils and larger aggregates that were taller than 6 nm in height appeared only after 72 h (Fig. 1B, upper panel and Fig. S2, A and B in Supplemental Data). Under the same conditions, Aβ-Arctic remained in small nonfibrillar states at 1 h but had already assembled into fibrils and larger aggregates by 24 h (Fig. 1B, lower panel and Fig. S2, C and D in Supplemental Data). These results differ from the original report of the Arctic mutation (29Nilsberth C. Westlind-Danielsson A. Eckman C.B. Condron M.M. Axelman K. Forsell C. Stenh C. Luthman J. Teplow D.B. Younkin S.G.

Differences in experimental conditions that may explain this discrepancy include the use of Aβ1–42 instead of Aβ1–40 and of AFM instead of size exclusion chromatography in the current study. Our AFM findings are consistent with other studies demonstrating that the Arctic mutation accelerates fibril formation (30Lashuel H.A. Hartley D.M. Petre B.M. Wall J.S. Simon M.N. Walz T. Lansbury J.

Notably, after 24 h of incubation, samples containing Aβ-Arctic had significantly fewer nonfibrillar assemblies (Fig. 1C) and lower ratios of nonfibrillar to fibrillar assemblies than samples containing Aβ-Wt (Fig. 1, C and D). Effects of the Arctic Mutation on Plaque Load and Aβ*56 Levels in Vivo—To examine the effect of the Arctic mutation on Aβ assembly in vivo, we studied three lines of hAPP transgenic mice that produce human Aβ-Wt (line J20) or Aβ-Arctic (lines ARC6 and ARC48) (Fig. 2A). The Swedish and Indiana familial AD mutations within hAPP sequences flanking Aβ (Fig. 2A) were introduced into all three lines to maximize production of the pathogenic Aβ1–42 species. Because J20 mice carry only these mutations, their transgene-derived Aβ has the sequence of wild-type human Aβ. Because both ARC lines in addition carry the Arctic mutation, which resides in the middle of Aβ, they produce Arctic-mutant human Aβ. The levels of hAPP in the forebrain were lower in ARC6 mice and higher in ARC48 mice than in J20 mice (Fig. 2B). At 3–4 months of age, levels of guanidine-soluble Aβ1-x and Aβ1–42 in the forebrain were comparable in J20 and ARC6 mice and much higher in ARC48 mice (Fig. 2C). The Aβ1–42/Aβ1-x ratios were similar in all three lines (Fig. 2D). An analysis of plaque formation in the hippocampus confirmed and extended our previous observations (34Cheng I. Palop J. Esposito L. Bien-Ly N. Yan F. Mucke L. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1190-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). At 3–4 months, hippocampal Aβ deposition was undetectable or minimal in J20 mice, moderate in ARC6 mice, and prominent in ARC48 mice (Fig. 3, A and C). Only ARC48 mice showed reactive astrocytosis (Fig. 3E). At 10–12 months, thioflavin-S-positive mature plaques with dystrophic neurites were present in all three lines (Fig. 3B) but were much more abundant in the ARC lines than in line J20 (Fig. 3D"

Imatinib-resistance mechanisms are heterogeneous, and little is known about KIT functional roles in imatinib-resistant GIST. Biological consequences of biochemical inhibition of KIT, phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3-K), PLCγ, MAPK/ERK kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK/MAPK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and JAK were determined by immunoblotting for protein activation, and by cell proliferation and apoptosis assays in GIST cell lines from imatinib-sensitive GIST (GIST882), imatinib-resistant GISTs (GIST430 and GIST48) and KIT-negative GIST (GIST62). KIT activation was 3- to 6-fold higher in GIST430 and GIST48 than in GIST882, whereas total KIT expression was comparable in these three GIST lines. In addition to the higher set point for KIT activation, GIST430 and GIST48 had intrinsic imatinib resistance. After treatment with 1 μ M imatinib, residual KIT activation was 6- and 2.8-fold higher in GIST430 and GIST48, respectively, compared to GIST882. In all GIST lines, cell growth arrest resulted from PI3-K inhibition, and – to a lesser extent – from MEK/MAPK and mTOR inhibition. Inhibition of JAK/STAT or PLCγ did not affect cell proliferation. Similarly, only PI3-K inhibition resulted in substantial apoptosis in the imatinib-resistant GISTs. We conclude that GIST secondary KIT mutations can be associated with KIT hyperactivation and imatinib resistance. Targeting critical downstream signaling proteins, such as PI3-K, is a promising therapeutic strategy in imatinib-resistant GISTs."
https://openalex.org/W2117183312,"The effects of nonmutagenic environmental exposures can sometimes be transmitted for several generations, suggesting transgenerational inheritance of induced epigenetic variation. Methyl donor supplementation of female mice during pregnancy induces CpG hypermethylation at the agouti viable yellow (A(vy)) allele in A(vy)/a offspring. Epigenetic inheritance occurs at A(vy); when passed through the female germ line, A(vy) epigenotype is not completely ""reset."" We therefore tested whether diet-induced epigenetic alterations at A(vy) are inherited transgenerationally. Female A(vy)/a mice were weaned onto either control (n=6) or a methyl-supplemented diet (n=5). These F0 dams were mated with a/a males. All F1 and F2 A(vy)/a females were weaned onto the same diet as their mothers, then mated with a/a males. F1, F2, and F3 A(vy)/a offspring were classified for coat color, an indicator of A(vy) methylation. In total, 62 F1, 98 F2, and 209 F3 A(vy)/a mice were studied. As expected, average A(vy)/a coat color was darker in the supplemented group (P<0.01). However, there was no cumulative effect of supplementation across successive generations. These results suggest that, in the female germ line, diet-induced A(vy) hypermethylation occurs in the absence of additional epigenetic modifications that normally confer transgenerational epigenetic inheritance at the locus."
https://openalex.org/W2008021858,"The peroxisomal protein import receptor Pex5p is modified by ubiquitin, both in an Ubc4p-dependent and -independent manner. Here we show that the two types of ubiquitination target different residues in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of Pex5p and we identify Pex4p (Ubc10p) as the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme required for Ubc4p-independent ubiquitination. Whereas Ubc4p-dependent ubiquitination occurs on two lysine residues, Pex4p-dependent ubiquitination neither requires lysine residues nor the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal α-NH<sub>2</sub> group. Instead, a conserved cysteine residue appears to be essential for both the Pex4p-dependent ubiquitination and the overall function of Pex5p. In addition, we show that this form of ubiquitinated Pex5p is susceptible to the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol, a compound that is unable to break ubiquitin-NH<sub>2</sub> group linkages. Together, our results strongly suggest that Pex4p-dependent ubiquitination of Pex5p occurs on a cysteine residue."

DRB treatment blocks RNAPII transcription specifically at an early step in elongation without inhibiting the enzymatic activity of purified RNAPII itself (4Tamm I. Kikuchi T. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Two negative elongation factors, the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) and the negative elongation factor (NELF) cause transcription pausing by physically associating with RNAPII (6Wada T.

Early studies identified many genes that were regulated at the stage of transcription elongation, including hsp70 (15Rougvie A.E. Lis J.T. Cell. 1988; 54: 795-804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), c-myc (16Krumm A. Meulia T. Brunvand M. Groudine M.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), and later a common regulatory mechanism utilized by these genes was uncovered, which was the recruitment of P-TEFb to the transcription machinery (12Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 19Lis J.T. Mason P. Peng J.

Indeed, P-TEFb is the key regulator that causes RNAPII to overcome the rate-limiting step during the early stage of elongation. P-TEFb is an essential cellular coactivator for the viral transactivator Tat in stimulating transcription from HIV-LTR (12Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that control of gene expression by P-TEFb plays an important role in cellular activation, proliferation, and differentiation (2Peterlin B.M. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 297-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). It has been shown that many causes of cardiac hypertrophy converge at the critical step of up-regulation of P-TEFb activity (21Kulkarni P.A. Sano M. Schneider M.D. Rec. Progr. Hormone Res. 2004; 59: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Sano M. Abdellatif M. Oh H. Xie M. Bagella L. Giordano A. Michael L.H. DeMayo F.J. Schneider M.D. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). High P-TEFb activity may also play a role in maintenance of the cancer state, evidenced by the fact that one potential anti-cancer drug, flavopiridol, has been found to act as a potent P-TEFb inhibitor (23Chao S.H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31793-31799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Although required for the productive elongation of many genes, P-TEFb by itself has been shown to have no direct effect on RNAPII elongation rate in vitro, emphasizing that P-TEFb functions as a regulator of other elongation factors (11Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42601-42609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). P-TEFb can phosphorylate several proteins during elongation. It is responsible for hyperphosphorylation of the serine 2 positions of heptapeptide repeats in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNAPII (10Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Similarly, the CTD-like heptapeptide repeats in the C-terminal region of the hSpt5 subunit of DSIF can also be phosphorylated by P-TEFb, which is crucial for the positive elongation activity of DSIF (24Yamada T. Yamaguchi Y. Inukai N. Okamoto S. Mura T. Handa H. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 227-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of one of the NELF subunits, NELFe, has been correlated with dissociation of NELF from elongation complexes that contain nascent RNA with double-stranded regions (25Fujinaga K. Irwin D. Huang Y. Taube R. Kurosu T. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It remains unclear if phosphorylation of all or only a subset of these P-TEFb substrates is directly responsible and sufficient for the regulation of elongation. Indeed, P-TEFb-mediated phosphorylations on RNAPII-CTD and DSIF are known to be involved in pre-mRNA processing (26Ni Z. Schwartz B.E. Werner J. Suarez J.R. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 27Mandal S.S. Chu C. Wada T. Handa H. Shatkin A.J. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, exactly how P-TEFb-mediated phosphorylations cause functional changes in elongation complexes is not well understood. Other known elongation factors such as TFIIF (30Price D.H. Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1465-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), TFIIS (31Guo H. Price D.H. J. Biol.

Science (New York, NY). 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar) affect elongation, but their role in the elongation control process is unclear (33Reines D. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). DSIF has been implicated as both a positive and negative elongation factor (6Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In humans it is composed of two subunits (160 and 14 kDa) that are homologs of yeast proteins Spt5 and Spt4 (6Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Its transcription repression activity requires NELF and can be alleviated by P-TEFb (7Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7395-7403Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that P-TEFb causes the transition of RNAPII into productive elongation mode by reversing the negative effect of DSIF and NELF (14Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Watanabe D. Handa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7395-7403Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 34Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggested that phosphorylation of DSIF by P-TEFb can switch it into a positive elongation factor (24Yamada T. Yamaguchi Y. Inukai N. Okamoto S. Mura T. Handa H. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 227-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). DSIF has been shown to have a stimulatory effect on elongation only in reactions containing nuclear extract and limiting concentrations of ribonucleoside triphosphates (6Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), but it has no effects in the absence of other proteins (11Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42601-42609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The exact role of DSIF and other factors in stimulating the rate of transcription after P-TEFb function and the mechanisms utilized to transduce the signal from P-TEFb are not known. Most of the factors affecting RNAPII elongation were identified through utilizing functional assays that provided a means of purifying factors that had observable effects on the native elongation properties of RNAPII (35Adamson T.E. Shore S.M. Price D.H. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 264-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Previously, we developed an in vitro transcription system using an immobilized DNA template to study elongation control of RNAPII (11Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42601-42609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 35Adamson T.E. Shore S.M. Price D.H. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 264-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Early elongation complexes containing pulse-labeled nascent RNAs were isolated and allowed to further extend transcripts in the presence of elongation factors that were added back. When purified DSIF and NELF along with recombinant P-TEFb were tested, we confirmed that the two negative factors, when present together, were able to slow the elongation of RNAPII and this effect could be eliminated by P-TEFb (11Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42601-42609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Our data also demonstrated that the general transcription factor, TFIIF could dramatically stimulate the elongation rate and could functionally compete with DSIF and NELF in controlling RNAPII elongation (11Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42601-42609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In this study, we employed an in vitro transcription system optimized to further dissect the functional mechanisms of P-TEFb-mediated elongation control. We found that P-TEFb-directed phosphorylation events can be fulfilled without active transcription, making it possible to more thoroughly study the functional targets of P-TEFb. During the course of our studies, we realized that the properties of elongation complexes are completely resistant to known positive factors before P-TEFb function and completely resistant to negative factors after P-TEFb function. In addition, our data strongly suggest that P-TEFb not only reverses the negative effect of DSIF and NELF, but also facilitates the function of TFIIF as the major positive elongation factor in productive elongation. Materials—HeLa nuclear extract (HNE) was prepared as described by Adamson et al. (35Adamson T.E. Shore S.M. Price D.H. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 264-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).

P-TEFb containing Cdk9 and cyclin T2a was expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified as described by Peng et al. (36Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H.

Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Isolation of Early Elongation Complexes (EECs)—An immobilized DNA template was generated as previously described which contained the full cytomegalovirus promoter driving the production of a 548 nt run-off transcript (11Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42601-42609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The protocol used to generate early elongation complexes was also as previously described (11Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Price D.H. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 264-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) except for some modifications. For each individual transcription reaction, 8 μl of preincubation mixture containing 200 ng of template (∼0.5 pmol) and 1 μl of HNE was incubated with 20 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 10 units of RNaseOUT™ (Invitrogen), and 1 μm flavopiridol for 10 min at room temperature. Transcription was initiated upon the addition of physiological concentrations of ATP, GTP, UTP (500 μm), and 5 μCi of [α-32P]CTP. After 30 s of pulse, elongation was halted with the addition of EDTA to 20 mm, and the resultant EECs contained labeled nascent RNA predominantly less than 25 nt in length. Complexes associated with the immobilized templates were stringently washed three times with high salt EEC isolation buffer (20 mm HEPES and 1.6 m KCl) followed by two washes with low salt EEC isolation buffer (20 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), and resuspended in low salt EEC isolation buffer. The isolated EECs used in each experiment were generated in one large reaction, isolated, and aliquoted into individual elongation reactions. Transcript Extension (Chase)—Extension of transcripts from isolated EECs was carried out in 18-μl reactions by first mixing the isolated complexes with either HNE or purified factors in transcription buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm MgCl2, and 10 units of RNaseOUT™. Elongation was then resumed upon the addition of NTPs to 500 μm and allowed to proceed for the indicated amounts of time at room temperature. Except for specific indications, we carried out the elongation reactions for 7 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 200 μl of Stop Solution (100 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Sarkosyl, 200 μg/ml Torula yeast RNA (Sigma)). RNA preparation and analyses on denaturing gels were described previously (38Price D.H. Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3244-3255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autoradiography of the dried gels provided images of the results, and quantitation was accomplished with a Packard InstantImager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Prephosphorylation Reactions—Recombinant P-TEFb and the indicated combinations of components, including preterminated EECs (see pretermination reactions below), DSIF, NELF, and HNE, were assembled in 9-μl reactions (half size of the final transcription elongation reactions) in the same transcript extension conditions as described above excluding NTPs. The prephosphorylation reactions were started upon the addition of ATP to 500 μm and were allowed to proceed for 5 min at room temperature, and then P-TEFb activity was inhibited by the addition of flavopiridol to 1 μm. When only a subset of the components was subjected to prephosphorylation, the indicated unphosphorylated components were supplemented after the termination of P-TEFb-directed prephosphorylation. Each of the final transcription reactions was 18 μl with the transcript extension conditions kept the same as above. Elongation was allowed to proceed for indicated times upon the addition of CTP, UTP, and GTP to 500 μm. Pre-termination Reactions—When isolated EECs were incubated with P-TEFb in the presence of 500 μm ATP, some polymerases terminated because of the presence of a trace amount of TTF2 remaining bound to the DNA template. TTF2 is a transcription termination factor and its dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity is required for releasing transcripts from the template (39Xie Z. Price D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31902-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP, TTF2 preferentially binds with ssDNA, and its ATPase activity is thus suppressed (40Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3771-3777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To limit the impact of contaminating TTF2 during prephosphorylation reactions and subsequent transcription reactions, we carried out a “pre-termination” reaction to inhibit the continuous activity of TTF2. Isolated EECs were incubated with 500 μm ATP, 3 mm MgCl2, and 100 ng per reaction of ssDNA (a 50-nt DNA oligo with random sequences, synthesized by IDT) at room temperature for 5 min. During this process, only a small fraction of EECs terminated, and once TTF2 came off from these terminated DNA it bound to ssDNA. The pre-terminated EECs were then washed with high salt EEC isolation buffer to remove the terminated polymerases, released RNA, contaminating TTF2 and ssDNA. Eventually, the beads were washed and resuspended with low salt EEC isolation buffer and ready for the prephosphorylation treatment. Amounts of HeLa Nuclear Extract or Purified Factors Used in Transcription Reactions—1 μl per reaction of HNE was used for generating early elongation complexes. The same amount of HNE was also used in indicated add-back assays except for specific indications. The amounts of recombinant DSIF and NELF were optimized to achieve the maximal negative effect on elongation and called “1×.” 1× of DSIF was 0.45 pmol per reaction and 1× of NELF was 0.03 pmol per reaction. 1× of TFIIF was 0.2 pmol, which is the lowest level that achieved the maximal increase in elongation rate in a 2-min reaction. 1× of P-TEFb was 3.3 pmol. 1× of factors was applied in either prephosphorylation reactions or in add-back assays unless otherwise indicated. A previously developed in vitro transcription system using an immobilized DNA template (11Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42601-42609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 35Adamson T.E. Shore S.M. Price D.H. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 264-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was further optimized and employed here to explore the details of RNAPII elongation control by P-TEFb. The core of this technique is to determine the influence of a crude extract or purified elongation factors on elongation of nascent transcripts in isolated early elongation complexes (EECs) using add-back assays. A 5′-biotinylated DNA template containing the CMV immediate early promoter is immobilized onto paramagnetic beads through a biotin-streptavidin linkage, which allows for the subsequent isolation of the early elongation complexes. Preinitiation complexes are formed on the promoter by incubation with HNE. Upon the addition of nucleotides including limiting [α-32P]CTP, RNAPII initiates and generates labeled, nascent transcripts that are 15-20 nt in length within 30 s. Polymerases are halted by addition of EDTA and repeatedly washed with very high salt buffer followed by low salt washes and are finally resuspended in transcription buffer without nucleotides. The isolated EECs are then supplemented with either a crude extract or purified elongation factors and allowed to extend nascent transcripts upon addition of nucleotides. The transcripts are extracted and analyzed on a denaturing RNA gel and the effects of the factors on elongation are evaluated from the resultant change in the sizes of the RNAs. For brevity, we shall refer to the transcription assays with a HeLa nuclear extract added back or with only purified factors added back as the “crude system” or “defined system,” respectively. The defined system is named not because every component is known to be 100% pure, but because the components are highly purified and have defined methods of isolation. Although DSIF and NELF have been demonstrated to be very pure (11Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42601-42609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), it is possible that other proteins besides RNA polymerase II subunits may be present in the isolated elongation complexes (41Ujvari A. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49773-49779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A systematic examination of the high salt EEC isolation conditions was carried out, and we found that raising the salt from 1 to 1.6 m (data not shown) and elimination of the Sarkosyl resulted in the isolated EECs that responded more efficiently to DSIF and NELF and other elongation factors such as TFIIF (supplemental Fig. S1). This eliminated a serious limitation in our early attempt to reconstitute elongation control in a defined system in which only about half of the isolated EECs responded to DSIF and NELF (11Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42601-42609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We believe that Sarkosyl was not completely removed during the following low salt washes, and this negatively affected the function of the factors added back, presumably, by interfering with their interaction with EECs. Reconstitution of P-TEFb-mediated Elongation Control in Vitro—Using EECs isolated under the new optimized conditions, we first examined the effect of recombinant DSIF and affinity-purified NELF on RNAPII elongation by examining the change in the kinetics of elongation. Isolated EECs were allowed to elongate for indicated times (from 0.5 to 16 min) in the absence or presence of DSIF and NELF (Fig. 1A). With no factors added back, isolated EECs that initially contained transcripts predominantly less than 25 nt in length (Fig. 1A, lane 1) moved slowly down the template at a relatively constant rate, as evidenced by the increase in the average lengths of the accumulated transcripts with time (Fig. 1A, lanes 2-7). The native elongation rate under these experimental conditions was about 25 nt per minute, and no run-off transcripts (548 nt) were detected even after 16 min of elongation. With the addition of DSIF and NELF, a decrease in the length of transcripts was observed at all the time points tested (Fig. 1A, lanes 8-13). Consistent with our previous report (11Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42601-42609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), DSIF and NELF appeared to significantly increase the time that RNAPII elongation complexes spent at intrinsic pause sites. Inclusion of DSIF and NELF resulted in the reduction of the elongation rate for almost all polymerases to about 30% of their native rate (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 8-13 to 2-7). Next we attempted to reconstitute P-TEFb-mediated elongation control using both a defined system and a crude system. Isolated EECs were allowed to elongate for 7 min with or without additional factors. The nascent transcripts were extende"

SWI/SNF function requires one of two paralogous ATPase subunits, Brahma (BRM) or BRM-related gene 1 (BRG1), which we previously found are lost together in cancer cell lines and primary lung cancers. Although BRG1 has been found to be mutated in cancer cell lines, the mechanisms underlying BRM silencing are not known. To address this question, we sequenced BRM in 10 BRM/BRG1-deficient cancer cell lines and found that BRM was devoid of abrogating mutations. Moreover, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors restored BRM expression in each of these BRG1/BRM-deficient cancer cell lines, indicating that epigenetic silencing is a major mechanism underlying the loss of BRM expression. Despite their ability to restore BRM expression, these HDAC inhibitors also blocked BRM function when present. However, after their removal, we observed that BRM expression remained elevated for several days, and during this period, BRM activity was detected. We also found that the suppression of BRM occurs in a broad range of human tumor types and that loss of one or both BRM alleles potentiated tumor development in mice. Thus, BRG1 and BRM are silenced by different mechanisms, and it may be possible to clinically target and reexpress BRM in a number of tumor types, potentially impacting tumor development."

Although the frequency of ARI is similar in both developed and developing countries, mortality due to ARI is 10-50 times higher in developing countries. Viruses are common causes of ARI among such children, yet the disease burden of these infections in rural communities is unknown.A prospective longitudinal study was carried out in children enrolled from two rural Indian villages at birth and followed weekly for the development of ARI, classified as upper respiratory infection, acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI), or severe ALRI. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza viruses and adenoviruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates were detected by direct fluorescent antibody testing (DFA) and, in addition, centrifugation enhanced culture for RSV was done. 281 infants enrolled in 39 months and followed until 42 months. During 440 child years of follow-up there were 1307 ARIs, including 236 ALRIs and 19 severe ALRIs. Virus specific incidence rates per 1000 child years for RSV were total ARI 234, ALRI 39, and severe ALRI 9; for influenza A total ARI 141, ALRI 39; for INF B total ARI 37; for PIV1 total ARI 23, for PIV2 total ARI 28, ALRI 5; for parainfluenza virus 3 total ARI 229, ALRI 48, and severe ALRI 5 and for adenovirus total ARI 18, ALRI 5. Repeat infections with RSV were seen in 18 children.RSV, influenza A and parainfluenza virus 3 were important causes of ARI among children in rural communities in India. These data will be useful for vaccine design, development and implementation purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2002317949,"MDC1 and 53BP1 are critical components of the DNA damage response (DDR) machinery that protects genome integrity and guards against cancer, yet the tissue expression patterns and involvement of these two DDR adaptors/mediators in human tumours remain largely unknown. Here we optimized immunohistochemical analyses of human 53BP1 and MDC1 proteins in situ and identified their virtually ubiquitous expression, both in proliferating and quiescent, differentiated tissues. Focus formation by 53BP1 and/or MDC1 in human spermatogenesis and subsets of breast and lung carcinomas indicated physiological and ‘pathological’ activation of the DDR, respectively. Furthermore, aberrant reduction or lack of either protein in significant proportions of carcinomas supported the candidacy of 53BP1 and MDC1 for tumour suppressors. Contrary to carcinomas, almost no activation or loss of MDC1 or 53BP1 were found among testicular germ-cell tumours (TGCTs), a tumour type with unique biology and exceptionally low incidence of p53 mutations. Such concomitant presence (in carcinomas) or absence (in TGCTs) of DDR activation and DDR aberrations supports the roles of MDC1 and 53BP1 within the ATM/ATR-regulated checkpoint network which, when activated, provides an early anti-cancer barrier the pressure of which selects for DDR defects such as p53 mutations or loss of 53BP1/MDC1 during cancer progression."

Reduced ELF but not TBRII, or Smad4 was observed in 8 of 9 human HCCs (P<0.017). ELF and TBRII are also markedly decreased in human HCC cell lines SNU-398 and SNU-475. Restoration of ELF and TBRII in SNU-398 cells markedly decreases cyclin D1 as well as hyperphosphorylated-retinoblastoma (hyperphosphorylated-pRb). Thus, we show that TGF-β signaling and Smad adaptor ELF suppress human hepatocarcinogenesis, potentially through cyclin D1 deregulation. Loss of ELF could serve as a primary event in progression toward a fully transformed phenotype and could hold promise for new therapeutic approaches in human HCCs."

We tested here whether similar treatments show value in a stronger immunogenetic combination, i.e., BALB/c to C57BL/6, and attempted to elucidate the mechanism accounting for tolerance. Induction of HO-1, administering CO or bilirubin to the donor, the islets or the recipient, prolonged islet allograft survival to different extents. Combining all the above treatments (the ""combined"" protocol) led to survival for >100 days and antigen-specific tolerance to 60% of the transplanted grafts. A high level of forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) expression was detected in the long-term surviving grafts. With the combined protocol, significantly more T regulatory cells (Tregs) were observed surrounding islets 7 days following transplantation. No prolongation of graft survival was observed using the combined protocol when CD4+ CD25+ T cells were predepleted from the recipients before transplantation. In conclusion, our combined protocol led to long-term survival and tolerance to islets in the BALB/c to C57BL/6 combination by promoting Foxp3+ Tregs; these cells played a critical role in the induction and maintenance of tolerance in the recipient."
https://openalex.org/W2028977552,"Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) often locate at chromosomal regions with frequent deletions in tumors. Loss of 16q23 occurs frequently in multiple tumors, indicating the presence of critical TSGs at this locus, such as the well-studied WWOX. Herein, we found that ADAMTS18, located next to WWOX, was significantly downregulated in multiple carcinoma cell lines. No deletion of ADAMTS18 was detected with multiplex differential DNA-PCR or high-resolution 1-Mb array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis. Instead, methylation of the ADAMTS18 promoter CpG Island was frequently detected with methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite genome sequencing in multiple carcinoma cell lines and primary carcinomas, but not in any nontumor cell line and normal epithelial tissue. Both pharmacological and genetic demethylation dramatically induced the ADAMTS18 expression, indicating that CpG methylation directly contributes to the tumor-specific silencing of ADAMTS18. Ectopic ADAMTS18 expression led to significant inhibition of both anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of carcinoma cells lacking the expression. Thus, through functional epigenetics, we identified ADAMTS18 as a novel functional tumor suppressor, being frequently inactivated epigenetically in multiple carcinomas."

To understand the basis of its unique subcellular localization properties, we investigated the mechanism of in vitro and cellular sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG)-mediated membrane binding of PKCθ. PKCθ showed phosphatidylserine selectivity in membrane binding and kinase action, which contributes to its translocation to the phosphatidylserine-rich plasma membrane in HEK293 cells.

Also, the mutational analysis indicates that the C1B domain plays a predominant role in the DAG-induced membrane binding and activation of PKCθ. Furthermore, the Ca2+-independent C2 domain of PKCθ has significant affinity for anionic membranes, and the truncation of the C2 domain greatly enhanced the membrane affinity and enzyme activity of PKCθ. In addition, membrane binding properties of Y90E and Y90F mutants indicate that phosphorylation of Tyr90 of the C2 domain enhances the affinity of PKCθ for model and cell membranes.

Based upon structural differences in the regulatory domains, PKCs are typically subdivided into three classes; conventional PKC (α, βI, βII, and γ subtypes), novel PKC (δ, ɛ, η, and θ subtypes), and atypical PKC (ζ and λ/ι subtypes). Conventional and novel PKCs have two types of lipid binding domains, a tandem repeat of C1 domains (C1A and C1B) and a C2 domain, in the regulatory domains. The C1 domain (∼50 residues) is a cysteine-rich compact module that was identified as the interaction site for sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and phorbol ester (4Brose N. Rosenmund C. J.

All novel PKCs contain a Ca2+-independent C2 domain in the amino terminus followed by the C1A and C1B domains in the regulatory domain (see Fig. 7A). PKCθ is a novel PKC that is present predominantly in T lymphocytes and muscle cells. T cell activation requires sustained interaction of T cell receptor (TCR) with major histocompatibility complex-bound peptide antigen of the antigen-presenting cell at the cell-cell contact region, the so-called immunological synapse, where activated TCR molecules are clustered (11Grakoui A.

Generation of DAG by phospholipase Cγ1 isoform in the plasma membrane in response to TCR triggering is a key signal in the initiation of T cell activation which culminates in the cell proliferation and the execution of T cell effector functions (12Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). T cells express many PKC isoforms (α, βI, δ, ɛ, η, θ, and ζ) (13Altman A.

Sugie K. Hong S. van Stipdonk M.J. Altman A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), are recruited. Because lipid rafts are not restricted to the immunological synapse, lipid raft translocation of PKCθ may not fully account for the specific targeting of PKCθ; however, this suggests that PKCθ may specifically interact with lipid or protein components of lipid rafts. Vav1 protein, which is a guanine exchange factor for a small GTPase Rac and mediates actin polymerization, promotes translocation of PKCθ to the membrane (20Villalba M. Coudronniere N. Deckert M. Teixeiro E. Mas P. Altman A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 151-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This suggests that PKCθ may also interact directly or indirectly with a cytoskeletal protein. Also, it was reported that TCR stimulation leads to rapid phosphorylation of PKCθ on Tyr90 in its C2 domain (see Fig. 7A)byLck kinase, which appears to be necessary for the recruitment of PKCθ to the immunological synapse (21Liu Y. Witte S. Liu Y.C. Doyle M. Elly C. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3603-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although these studies have provided important clues, the exact mechanism underlying the specific targeting of PKCθ in T cells still remains unknown. The paucity of mechanistic information on PKCθ is in part attributed to the low stability of the protein, which makes it difficult to prepare recombinant wild type and mutant proteins in amounts sufficient for biophysical measurements. We have recently studied the mechanisms of membrane targeting and activation of conventional PKCs (PKCα and PKCγ) (22Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol.

These studies have revealed that individual PKC isoforms follow distinct activation mechanisms due in part to the differences in the conformational flexibility and DAG affinity of their C1 domains. As a continuation of this line of investigation and as a first step toward the understanding of the mechanism of specific targeting of PKCθ in T cells, we investigated the mechanism by which DAG induces the in vitro and cellular membrane recruitment and activation of PKCθ with a particular emphasis on elucidating the roles of C1A, C1B, and C2 domains in these processes. To overcome the experimental difficulties associated with the low stability of PKCθ, we employed various sensitive in vitro and cellular techniques that allow quantification of the membrane binding and activity of PKCθ wild type and mutants. Results reveal that PKCθ has a unique membrane binding and activation mechanism, which derives mainly from unique properties of its two C1 domains and C2 domain. Materials—1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoinositol (POPI), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS), sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8), and sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol (DiC18) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and used without further purification. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) was purchased from Cayman. Triton X-100, ATP, octyl glucoside, and CHAPS were from Sigma. Phospholipids concentrations were determined by a modified Bartlett analysis. [γ32P]ATP was from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction endonucleases and enzymes for molecular biology were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Pioneer L1 sensor chip was from Biacore AB (Piscataway, NJ). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and Lipofectamine™ were from Invitrogen. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, zeocin, ponasterone A, pIND vector, TMN-FH medium, and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. Expression Vector Construction and Mutagenesis—For bacterial expression of C2 (amino acids (aa) 1-123), C1A (aa 160-219), and C1B (aa 232-281) domains, the expression vectors were generated by subcloning the domain sequences from the human PKCθ cDNA into the pET21d vector (Novagen) between the restriction sites NcoI and XhoI. This vector is designed to introduce a carboxyl-terminal His6 tag for affinity purification of the expressed proteins. For the expression of the full-length PKCθ in insect cells, the baculovirus transfer vector was generated by subcloning the cDNA of PKCθ into the pVL1392 plasmid between NotI and BamHI sites. The 3′-end primer was designed to introduce a carboxyl-terminal His6 tag. The baculovirus transfer vectors for PKCθ mutants were prepared by the PCR mutagenesis using the pVL1392-PKCθ plasmid as a template. Mammalian expression vectors of PKCθ and mutants with carboxyl-terminal enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) tags were generated by subcloning the corresponding genes with the spacer sequence, GGNSGG, into the pIND vector between restriction sites BamHI and NotI as previously described (25Stahelin R.V.

Protein Expression and Purification—Bacterial expression of C1A, C1B, and C2 domains was performed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). The C2 and C1B domains were expressed as a soluble protein, whereas the C1A domain formed inclusion bodies. The isolated domains were expressed and purified as previously described (25Stahelin R.V.

Full-length PKCθ and mutants were expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. The pVL1392-PKCθ DNA was prepared for transfection by using an EndoFree Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen) to avoid endotoxin contamination and transfected into Sf9 cells with BaculoGold™ transfection kit (BD Pharmingen). Cells were incubated for 4 days at 27 °C, and the supernatant was collected and used for amplification of virus. After 3 cycles of amplification, high titer virus stock was obtained. Sf9 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in TMN-FH medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For expression of the proteins, cells were grown to 2 × 106 cells/ml in 300-ml suspension cultures and infected with multiplicity of infection of 10. The cells were then incubated for 60 h at 27 °C. For protein purification, cells were harvested at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was then washed once with sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and resuspended in 22 ml of extraction buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). The suspension was homogenized in a hand-held homogenizer chilled on ice. The extract was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. One ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) was added and incubated on ice while shaking at 80 rpm for 1 h. The mixture was poured into a 10-ml empty column, and the resin was washed first with 10 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole and subsequently with 10 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 15 mm imidazole. The column was then washed with 6 ml of the same buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and next with 3 ml of the same buffer containing 25 mm imidazole. The protein was then eluted from the column with 6 × 0.75-ml fractions of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 300 mm imidazole. The eluted fractions were analyzed on an 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (see supplemental Fig. S1). Fractions containing PKCθ were concentrated and desalted in an Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Determination of PKC Activity—Activity of PKCθ was assayed by measuring the initial rate of [32P]phosphate incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP (50 μm, 0.6 μCi/tube) into myelin basic protein (200 μg/ml) (Sigma). The reaction mixture contained large unilamellar vesicles (0.2 mm total lipid concentration), 0.16 m KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The reaction was started by adding 50 mm MgCl2 to the mixture, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was then quenched with 5% phosphoric acid. Seventy-five μl of the quenched reaction mixture was pipetted on a P-81 ion exchange paper and washed 3 times with 5% phosphoric acid followed by a wash with 95% ethanol. The paper was dried in an oven at 60 °C for 10 min. The paper was then transferred into a scintillation vial containing 4 ml of scintillation fluid (Fisher), and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. SPR Analysis—Equilibrium SPR measurements were performed at 23 °C in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 m KCl as described previously (24Ananthanarayanan B. Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46886-46894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The first flow cell was used as the control surface and coated with 5000 resonance units of POPC. The second flow cell was used as the active surface and coated with 5000 resonance units of varying lipid compositions (e.g. POPC/POPS/DiC18 = 69:30:1). After lipid coating, 30 μl of 50 mm NaOH was injected at a flow rate of 100 μl/min to wash away any unbound lipids. The base-line shift was maintained below 0.3 resonance units/min with continued washing before any binding measurements. The flow rate for equilibrium membrane binding measurements was set at 5 μl/min to allow sufficient time for the R values of the association phase to reach saturation response values (Req) (see Fig. 2A). After sensorgrams were obtained for 5 different concentrations of each protein within a 10-fold range of Kd(see Table 1), each of the sensorgrams was corrected for refractive index change by subtracting the control surface response from it. Req values were then plotted versus protein concentrations (C), and the Kd value was determined by a nonlinear least-squares analysis of the binding isotherm using an equation Req = Rmax/(1 + Kd/C). Each data set was repeated three times to calculate average and S.D. values.TABLE 1Membrane binding parameters for PKCΘ, mutants, and isolated domains determined by SPR analysisProteinsKdRelative affinityaRatio of each (1/Kd) value to (1/Kd) of the PKCΘ wild type for POPC/POPS/DiC18 (69:30:1) vesicles.nmPOPC/POPS/DiC18 (69:30:1)PKCΘ20 ± 41.0W181G34 ± 100.58L183G32 ± 110.62W253G120 ± 100.16L255G280 ± 0.300.07E178A9.0 ± 0.32.2ΔC23.0 ± 0.36.7Y90E34 ± 100.58Y90F140 ± 100.14PKCΘ-C1A1900 ± 100PKCΘ-C1B26 ± 3POPC/POPG/DiC18 (69:30:1)PKCΘ550 ± 2500.04PKCΘ-C1B30 ± 8POPC/POPI/DiC18 (69:30:1)PKCΘ80 ± 200.25POPC/POPE/PtdIns(4,5)P2 (77:20:3)PKCΘ-C2100 ± 30PKCΘ-C2 (Y90E)96 ± 10PKCΘ-C2 (Y90F)110 ± 30POPC/POPE/POPS (60:20:20)PKCΘ-C2580 ± 70POPC/POPE/POPG (60:20:20)PKCΘ-C2600 ± 60a Ratio of each (1/Kd) value to (1/Kd) of the PKCΘ wild type for POPC/POPS/DiC18 (69:30:1) vesicles. Open table in a new tab Cell Culture—A stable HEK293 cell line expressing the ecdysone receptor (Invitrogen) was used for all experiments. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 98% humidity until 90% confluent. Only cells between the 5th and 20th passage were used in Lab-Tech™-chambered cover glass. Once the cells were 80-90% confluent the cells were transfected by adding 150 μl of unsupplemented DMEM containing 0.5 μg of endotoxin-free DNA and 1 μl of Lipofectamine reagent for 7-8 h at 37 °C. The transfection medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with supplemented DMEM. Then, 300 μl of supplemented DMEM containing zeocin and 5 μg/ml ponasterone A was added to the cells to induce protein expression. The protein expression was induced for 16-24 h. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Confluent HEK293 cells cultured in a 10-cm2 plate were washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, lysed in the cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, and a protease inhibitor mixture (one tablet per 10 ml of buffer)), sonicated for 10 s, and centrifuged for 30 min. Sf9 cell extracts were obtained as described above. The protein content of cell lysates was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). The lysates of Sf9 cells and HEK293 cells were incubated with the mouse monoclonal anti-PKCθ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 4 h, and the immunocomplexes were allowed to precipitate overnight with the protein A-agarose beads. Proteins were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions and transferred on to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting analysis. Blots were treated with either 1 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-PKCθ antibody or 1 μg/ml anti-phosphotyrosine antibody light chain (BD Transduction Laboratories) followed by the incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (0.01 ng/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualized with the ECL luminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Microscopy—Microscopy data were collected on a custombuilt combination laser scanning confocal and multiphoton microscope as described previously (25Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Medkova M. Ananthanarayanan B. Rafter J.D. Melowic H.R. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29501-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at the same laser power and gains and offset setting on the photomultiplier tubes. Transfected cells were washed twice with HEK buffer (1 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 6 mm sucrose). After washing, cells were overlaid with 150 μl of HEK buffer. Suitable cells were selected for imaging, and a single image was taken for each cell before the addition of DiC8. Then the translocation of protein was monitored at fixed intervals (every 7 s) after 150 μl of HEK buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml DiC8 was added. Control experiments were done with dimethyl sulfoxide. Images were analyzed using simFCS. Specifically, regions of interest in the cytosol were defined, and the average intensity in a square (1 μm × 1 μm) was obtained with respect to time. Membrane intensities were determined for each frame in individual cells by extending a line from cytosol to the outside of the cell and reading off the intensity with distance along the line. Intensity values corresponding to the place on the line indicating the edge of the cell were averaged. Lines were drawn in at least three places in each cell, and membrane intensity was determined. These values were averaged, and the resultant cytosolic intensity values were converted to a ratio for each frame: membrane/(membrane + cytosol). The values were then scaled for the entire time series from 0 to 100% of the obtained ratio for a given experiment. This allowed a comparison of ratiometric changes between experiments. Note that each experiment was repeated at least three times on a given day and was repeated at least two different days with different transfected cells. Phosphatidylserine (PS)-dependent Membrane Binding and Activation of PKCθ—It has been long known that PS enhances the membrane affinity and activity of PKCs (27Newton A.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed, however, that the PS dependence can vary significantly among PKC isoforms (24Ananthanarayanan B. Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46886-46894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 28Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Among conventional PKCs, PKCα (28Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and PKCβII (29Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) strongly prefer PS to other anionic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG), whereas PKCγ shows little selectivity between PS and PG (24Ananthanarayanan B. Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46886-46894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Among novel PKCs, PKCδ shows a high degree of PS selectivity (25Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Medkova M. Ananthanarayanan B. Rafter J.D. Melowic H.R. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29501-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), whereas PKCɛ does not display significant PS selectivity (26Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Medkova M. Ananthanarayanan B. Melowic H.R. Rafter J.D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19784-19793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because PKCθ is structurally very similar to PKCδ, it is expected to have high PS selectivity. To test this notion, we first measured the binding of PKCθ to POPC/POPS/DiC18, POPC/POPG/DiC18, and POPC/POPI/DiC18 (all 69:30:1 in mole ratio) vesicles by the SPR analysis. As shown in Table 1, PKCθ exhibited 28- and 4-fold higher affinity for POPC/POPS/DiC18 vesicles than for POPC/POPG/DiC18 and POPC/POPI/DiC18 vesicles, respectively. The 28-fold PS selectivity over PG is even higher than the ∼10-fold PS selectivity observed for PKCδ under similar conditions (25Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Medkova M. Ananthanarayanan B. Rafter J.D. Melowic H.R. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29501-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The PS selectivity of PKCθ was also evident in kinase activity measurements (see Fig. 1). PKCθ showed higher enzyme activity with POPC/POPS/DiC18 (99 - x:x:1) vesicles than with POPC/POPG/DiC18 or POPC/POPI/DiC18 (99 - x:x:1) vesicles at a given anionic lipid concentration. For example, PKCθ was 2-fold and 1.5-fold more active with POPC/POPS/DiC18 (69:30:1) vesicles than with POPC/POPI/DiC18 (69:30:1) and POPC/POPG/DiC18 (69:30:1) vesicles, respectively. This difference is smaller than expected from the Kd values of PKCθ for these vesicles, because it was necessary to perform the kinase assay under the condition in which a majority of enzyme molecules is membrane-bound (i.e. [lipids] ≫ Kd). Collectively, these results show that PKCθ has definite PS selectivity in membrane binding and kinase action. DAG Affinity of C1A and C1B Domains and Their Roles in PKCθ Activation—We previously measured the DAG affinities of isolated C1 domains of several PKCs, which indicated that differential roles of C1A and C1B domains in the membrane targeting and activation of PKCs are ascribed to their different DAG affinities (24Ananthanarayanan B.

https://openalex.org/W2111819389,"We have previously reported that 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1alpha,25(OH)2D3) can selectively suppress key functions of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) activated macrophages. To further explore this mechanism for its relevance in vivo, we investigated an infection model that crucially depends on the function of IFN-gamma activated macrophages, the infection with the intracellular protozoan Leishmania major. 1Alpha,25(OH)2D3 treatment of L. major infected macrophages demonstrated a vitamin D receptor (Vdr) dependent inhibition of macrophage killing activity. Further analysis showed that this was a result of decreased production of nitric oxide by 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-treated macrophages due to Vdr-dependent up-regulation of arginase 1 expression, which overrides NO production by Nos2. When analyzing the course of infection in vivo, we found that Vdr-knockout (Vdr-KO) mice were more resistant to L. major infection than their wild-type littermates. This result is in agreement with an inhibitory influence of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 on the macrophage mediated host defense. Further investigation showed that Vdr-KO mice developed an unaltered T helper cell type 1 (Th1) response on infection as indicated by normal production of IFN-gamma by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Therefore, we propose that the absence of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-mediated inhibition of macrophage microbicidal activity in Vdr-KO mice results in increased resistance to Leishmania infection."
https://openalex.org/W2030067084,"Methylthio-DADMe-immucillin-A (MT-DADMe-ImmA) is an 86-pm inhibitor of human 5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP).

Pegg A.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 55-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 3Wallace H.M. Fraser A.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). ODC is a difficult cancer target because of its rapid turnover and the dose-limiting toxicity of anti-ODC agents (4Meyskens Jr., F.L. Gerner E.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 945-951PubMed Google Scholar). Because of these difficulties, DFMO has not gained wide use. But the polyamine pathway, through its close interaction with S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) recycling, remains a target for cancer therapy. We investigated the possibility that feedback inhibition by 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA), induced by a transition state analogue inhibitor of 5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), could be used to block this pathway and initiate anticancer effects. The results indicate that blocking MTA recycling with transition state analogues of MTAP induces apoptosis through specific epigenetic changes in specific cultured cancer cell lines. Inhibition of MTAP is effective in treating a xenograft model of head and neck cancer in mice. MTA is a product of both spermidine and spermine synthases and provides product inhibition at two sequential sites in the polyamine pathway (Fig. 1A). In humans, MTA is degraded exclusively by MTAP (EC 2.4.2.28), expressed from a single gene locus at 9p21. MTAP produces adenine and 5-methylthio-α-d-ribose-1-phosphate (Fig. 1B), and these products are recycled to AdoMet. Inhibitors of MTAP are therefore expected to increase intracellular MTA, cause feedback inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis, prevent AdoMet recycling, and disrupt AdoMet-dependent methylation activity. One or more of these activities is expected to be associated with antiproliferative activity (5Carteni-Farina M. Cacciapuoti G. Porcelli M. Della Ragione F. Lancieri M. Geraci G. Zappia V. Biochim.

The transition state structure of human MTAP has been established by kinetic isotope effects and quantum chemical calculations. It is characterized by a late transition state with weak participation of the phosphate nucleophile, similar to that of human purine nucleoside phosphorylase but slightly more advanced (Fig. 1B) (9Singh V.

Methylthio-DADMe-Immucillin-A (MT-DADMe-ImmA) is a chemically stable transition state analogue of human MTAP and is a slow onset tightly binding inhibitor with a dissociation constant of 86 pm (18Singh V. Shi W. Evans G.B. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Almo S.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here we report the selective toxicity of MT-DADMe-ImmA in FaDu and Cal27, MTAP-positive human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. An increased cellular concentration of MTA is required for this activity. The specific action against some cancer cell lines but not others is proposed to be the result of changes in DNA methylation events to cause different responses to cells with diverse gene expression patterns. Homozygous deletions of the MTAP gene together with the tumor suppressor p16 are common in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia and have also been described in lung, bladder, pancreatic, endometrial, breast, ovarian, mantle cell lymphoma, conventional chondrosarcomas, and biliary tract cancers (19Chow W.A.

The deletion of p16 now appears to be more closely associated with tumor development. MTAP deletions in specific tumor cells in vivo have a metabolic effect different from whole organism inhibition of MTAP. Feedback inhibition effects associated with MTA accumulation will not occur in a MTAP-deficient tumor in the background of an intact mammal, since surrounding tissues are MTAP-normal and facilitate MTA removal. In whole animal MTAP inhibition, MTA accumulation is expected to permeate all tissues and may modulate cancer proliferation and metastases by metabolite feedback inhibition pathways described above. Metabolite accumulation effects are well known in human genetic diseases and are caused by specific enzyme defects. For example, homozygous null mutation of human adenosine deaminase causes accumulation of 2′-deoxyadenosine and severe combined immunodeficiency disease, specifically killing dividing B- and T-lymphocytes. Likewise, mutation or deletion of purine nucleoside phosphorylase causes accumulation of 2′-deoxyguanosine and a specific T-cell immune deficiency disease (25Fischer D. Van der Weyden M.B. Snyderman R. Kelly W.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 399-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mitchell B.S. Kelly W.N. Ann. Intern. Med. 1980; 92: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Inhibitors against either of these enzymes have been shown to have anticancer effects against the cell types influenced by the genetic deficiency (10Gandhi V. Kilpatrick J.M. Plunkett W. Ayres M.

Although no genetic deficiency model is known for MTAP, we explored the effects of cellular and whole animal MTAP ablation with MT-DADMe-ImmA, a slow onset tightly binding transition state analogue of the enzyme. Cell Lines, Culture, and MT-DADMe-ImmA—Human head and neck carcinoma cell lines, FaDu and Cal27, were provided by Dr. M. B. Prystowsky (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). Human breast carcinoma cell lines, MCF7, and a stable MTAP transfectant were provided by Dr. J. Martignetti (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York). Glioblastoma cell line U87, lung carcinoma cell line A549, and fibroblast cell line CRL2522 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Human fibroblast cell line GM02037 was obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ). FaDu, MCF7 (wild type), U87, and CRL2522 cells were maintained in Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Cal27 and GM02037 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with high glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. A549 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 medium (50:50) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were treated with either 20 μm MTA or 1 μm MT-DADMe-ImmA alone or in combination and compared with untreated controls. MT-DADMe-ImmA was synthesized by Industrial Research Ltd. (17Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Lenz D.H. Painter G.F. Schramm V.L. Singh V. Tyler P.C. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 4679-4689Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cells were photographed by phase-contrast microscopy, and cell numbers were determined by standard procedures. Cytotoxicity Assay—Cell viability was evaluated using the Alamar Blue assay. Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at a density of 104 cells/well and incubated with increasing concentrations of MT-DADMe-ImmA (100 pm to 100 μm) for 4 days at fixed MTA concentrations (0, 5, 10, and 20 μm). IC50 was determined following the manufacturer’s instructions (Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA). Apoptotic Assay—Apoptosis was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Cells (both free and attached) were harvested, and cell cycle analyses were done with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) (27Wang X. Deng H. Basu I. Zhu L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1377-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cell cycle distributions were calculated using ModFit LT software (Verify Software House, Inc., Topsham, ME). Mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated by cell incubation for 30 min in 40 nm DiOC6 (3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide; Molecular Probes, Inc.) before harvest (27Wang X. Deng H. Basu I. Zhu L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1377-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed using radioimmuno-precipitation assay buffer with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with primary antibodies and horseradish per-oxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were developed using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-MTAP antibody was produced from the custom antibody production services of Harlan Bioproducts for Science (Indianapolis, IN) using purified recombinant human MTAP expressed in Escherichia coli as antigen (18Singh V. Shi W. Evans G.B. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Almo S.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Anti-MTAP antibody was purified using a Melon gel IgG spin purification kit (Pierce) and used as described (28Chattopadhyay S. Zhao R. Tsai E. Schramm V.L. Goldman I.D. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2549-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies to caspase-9, caspase-3, caspase-7, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, secondary anti-rabbit, and anti-mouse antibody were from Cell Signaling, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Antibody for actin was purchased from Sigma. MTAP Activity Assay—Cells were harvested, washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 0.6% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. Assays for cellular MTAP activity contained 100 μg of protein from cell lysates in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 200 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.56, 10 mm KCl, and 50 μm MTA containing 18,000 cpm [8-14C]MTA. Labeled MTA was synthesized from [8-14C]S-adenosylmethionine by adjusting the pH to 3.0 followed by 3.5 h at 75 °C and purified by HPLC (18Singh V. Shi W. Evans G.B. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Almo S.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Products of the MTAP reaction were resolved on thin layer silica with 1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.55, containing 10% isopropyl alcohol. The adenine spots were excised and counted. MTAP activity in mouse blood was assayed in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 50 μm MTA containing 15,000 cpm of [2,8-3H]MTA and 7 μl of a 1:1 mixture of whole mouse blood and 0.6% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for a total volume of 10 μl. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 4 and 8 min, quenched with 1 μl of 70% perchloric acid, neutralized with KOH, centrifuged, and resolved on cellulose thin layer sheets with 1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, in 10% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol. Determination of Polyamines—Polyamines from 0.6 m perchloric acid extracts were purified via cation exchange chromatography and dansyl-derivatized with minor changes from a previous method (29Gaboriau F. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 2002; 47: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Samples were eluted from 10-ml Bio-Rad columns by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 3 min. The pH of the sodium carbonate used for derivatization was adjusted to 9.3, and the concentration of dansyl-chloride added to samples was adjusted to 100 mm. Dansyl-polyamines were quantitated by HPLC/fluorescence on a Waters Millennium system. Elution from a Phenomenex Luna 5 μ C18 (2Marton L.J. Pegg A.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 55-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) column used a mobile phase of 30% acetonitrile in a 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer at pH 6.8 (eluent A) and 100% acetonitrile (eluent B) with a gradient of 80% eluent A to 95% eluent B from 2 to 20 min. Fluorescence detection was by excitation at 338 nm and emission at 500 nm. MTA Quantitation—Perchloric acid extracts of cell lysates were mixed with 63 pmol of [5′-2H3]MTA (30Singh V. Lee J.E. Nunez S. Howell P.L. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11647-11659Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), neutralized with KOH, and centrifuged. MTA fractions were purified by HPLC (SymmetryShield RP18 column), concentrated, dissolved in 10% methanol with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and subjected to LCQ ESI-MS analysis. MTA was quantitated with an internal mass standard of [5′-2H3]MTA (mass 301) relative to the peak area for authentic MTA (mass 298) (31Sauve A.A. Moir R.D. Schramm V.L. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 595-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed in triplicate. siRNA-mediated Knockdown of MTAP Expression—FaDu cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with Oligo-fectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. siRNA against MTAP was purchased from the Dharmacon SMARTpool selection. A negative control was included in all siRNA experiments. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were split into fresh medium for another 36 h before analysis. Microarray Profiling of CpG Island DNA Methylation—Global profiling of aberrant DNA methylation of CpG islands in FaDu genomic DNA was carried out using the methylation-specific restriction enzyme microarray assay described previously (32Adrien L.R. Schlecht N.F. Kawachi N. Smith R.V. Brandwein-Gensler M. Massimi A. Chen S. Prystowsky M.B. Childs G. Belbin T.J. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2006; 114: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The methylation-specific restriction enzyme microarray assay compares a single DNA sample’s response to a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme (HpaII) (Cy5-red channel) and its corresponding methylation-insensitive isos-chizomer (MspI) (Cy3-green channel). Cy5/Cy3 ratios were therefore a qualitative measure of DNA methylation corresponding to each CpG island on the microarray. Red (Cy5) and green (Cy3) signal intensities for each element on the array were calculated using the GenePix Pro 3.0 software package. Data designated to be of poor quality or that did not achieve a signal/noise ratio of at least 2-fold were discarded from subsequent analysis. FaDu Xenografts—Male NOD.SCID mice (6-8 weeks old) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the approved protocol guidelines of the Animal Committee of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. FaDu cells (106) were inoculated into the dorsum of the hind foot. Tumors were established for 5 days and were followed by treatment with MT-DADMe-ImmA at 9 or 21 mg/kg body weight in drinking water or by daily intraperitoneal injections of 5 mg/kg body weight. After tumors were established, mice were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups of five animals each. Tumor volume (V) was determined from the equation, V = (4/3)×(22/7)×(1/8)×(length × width × height). Differences between treatment cohorts were determined using Student’s t test. Mice were weighed every 4-5 days and monitored for hair loss, loss of appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea. Total and differential blood and bone marrow analyses were performed after MT-DADMe-ImmA treatment. MT-DADMe-ImmA Treatment and Cellular MTAP Activity—Treatment of FaDu cells with 1 μm MT-DADMe-ImmA in combination with 20 μm MTA for 24 h caused a 96% reduction in MTAP activity (control = 0.535 ± 0.01 and treated = 0.020 ± 0.004 nmol of adenine formed/min/mg of protein). In this assay, cells are first washed free of unbound inhibitor followed by lysis in detergent. In this protocol, less than 5% of the tightly bound inhibitor dissociates during the assay procedure. Thus, in cultured cells, at least 96% of the MTAP activity is inhibited. The result also establishes that the inhibitor is permeable to FaDu cells. The MTAP activity of cultured human fibroblasts (CRL2522) showed similar inhibition (94% reduction) in this protocol (control = 0.245 ± 0.011 and treated = 0.015 ± 0.003 nmol of adenine formed/min/mg of protein). Effect of MT-DADMe-ImmA on Polyamine Levels—FaDu cells treated with MT-DADMe-ImmA and MTA (to prevent cellular MTA loss to medium) for 1-3 days showed increased putrescine and decreased spermine levels (Fig. 1C). In addition to the changes in cellular polyamines, putrescine in the medium becomes the dominant polyamine (greater than all cellular polyamines) in day 5 cultures treated with MTA + MT-DADMe-ImmA but not in control FaDu cells or those treated with MTA or MT-DADMe-ImmA alone (not shown). Thus, the combination of MTA and MT-DADMe-ImmA provides the most effective block of polyamine synthesis. Spent medium from 5-day FaDu cultures treated with MT-DADMe-ImmA and MTA revealed a 3.7-fold increase in putrescine relative to untreated culture medium. Supplementation of culture medium with putrescine, spermidine, and spermine alone or in combination did not prevent the apoptosis of FaDu cells caused by MT-DADMe-ImmA and MTA. Effects of DFMO on Polyamines—To test the hypothesis that decreased polyamine levels are responsible for FaDu cell death, cultures were treated with 5 mm DFMO, a known inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase. After 24 h of DFMO treatment (roughly one cell division time) the total intracellular polyamines were decreased from 12 ± 3 to 5 ± 1 nmol/mg protein. Extended culture of FaDu cells for 5 days in the presence of DFMO continued the depletion of polyamines to less than 1 nmol/mg protein. FaDu cells showed no decrease in growth rate from this treatment and did not undergo apoptotic changes. Thus, depletion of polyamines is not responsible for the onset of apoptosis in FaDu cells. Effect of MT-DADMe-ImmA on Cellular MTA—Complete inhibition of MTAP would be expected to cause intracellular accumulation of MTA. FaDu cells treated with MT-DADMe-ImmA alone or in combination with MTA for 3 days showed a 3-4-fold increase in MTA levels in washed cell extracts. MTA levels increased 6-7-fold at day 5 of treatment relative to untreated control FaDu cells (Fig. 1D). MTAP Expression in Tumor Cell Lines—Human cancer cell lines of different origins (breast MCF7, lung A549, head and neck FaDu or Cal27, glioblastoma U87, and fibroblast CRL2522) were screened for MTAP protein expression by Western blot using the anti-MTAP antibody (Fig. 2A). MTAP protein was readily detected in FaDu, Cal27, and CRL 2522 but not in MCF7, A549, or U87. Transfection of MCF7 with an expression vector for MTAP converted MCF7 to a strong positive response for MTAP. MT-DADMe-ImmA + MTA Inhibits FaDu Cell Growth—FaDu cells cultured in the presence of 1 μm MT-DADMe-ImmA alone or 20 μm MTA alone showed little growth inhibition and no apoptosis from these agents. MT-DADMe-ImmA and MTA used in combination gave powerful inhibition of cell growth (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast to FaDu cells, a human fibroblast cell line was not affected by the same treatment (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of FaDu cell growth by MT-DADMe-ImmA is dependent on MTA concentration. The experimental IC50 value for MT-DADMe-ImmA decreased from 500 to 50 nm as MTA was increased from 5 to 20 μm (Fig. 3C). MT-DADMe-ImmA alone caused little growth effect on FaDu cells even at 100 μm, 2,000 times the IC50 found in the presence of 20 μm MTA. Thus, MTA appears to be mediating cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in FaDu cells. The role of the inhibitor is to prevent MTA phosphorolysis and to cause MTA accumulation in the cells (Fig. 3C). FaDu cells are highly sensitive to MT-DADMe-ImmA in the presence of 20 μm MTA, and we selected 1 μm MT-DADMe-ImmA in the presence of 20 μm MTA for subsequent treatment conditions. MT-DADMe-ImmA and MTA Effects on Other Cell Lines—Growth suppression of FaDu cells by MT-DADMe-ImmA and MTA treatment appears to act through MTA effects. If MTA is the specific active agent, the addition of MTA alone would be expected to have similar effects on cell types that are MTAP-. MTAP-deficient cell lines would also be expected to be sensitive to MTA in combination with MT-DADMe-ImmA. We tested selected cell lines for susceptibility to the combination of MT-DADMe-ImmA and MTA to determine if the response of FaDu cells is unique to certain cell lines. MT-DADMe-ImmA alone (up to 100 μm) or under conditions that block growth of FaDu cells (1 μm MT-DADMe-ImmA + 20 μm MTA) had no apparent toxicity when cultured with five other MTAP-positive (fibroblast GM02037 and CRL2522) and MTAP-negative (lung A549, breast MCF7, and glioblastoma U87) human cancer cell lines (IC50 values >100 μm). Thus, MT-DADMe-ImmA does not inhibit growth at this concentration in the presence or absence of 20 μm MTA. MTA accumulation therefore has toxicity for only specific cell lines, including FaDu and another head and neck line, Cal27 (see below). MT-DADMe-ImmA and MTA Cause G2/M Arrest and Apoptosis in FaDu and Cal27 Cells—FaDu cells were exposed to 1 μm MT-DADMe-ImmA or 20 μm MTA alone or in combination for up to 6 days and subjected to flow cytometry analysis. Combined treatment arrested cells in G2/M starting at day 2, followed by a significant increase in sub-G1 cell fractions by day 4 and onward, indicating apoptotic activity (Fig. 4A). Another head and neck cancer cell line, Cal27, was also found to be sensitive to MT-DADMe-ImmA and MTA. After 8 days of treatment, the number of viable Cal27 cells decreased (supplemental Fig. A) as a result of G2/M arrest and apoptosis when compared with controls (Fig. 4B). Cell selectivity was tested by exposing normal human fibroblast cells (CRL2522) to MT-DADMe-ImmA and/or MTA for 21 days followed by fluorescent cell sorting analysis. No cytotoxicity was observed in CRL2522 cells after prolonged treatment (supplemental Fig. B). Mitochondrial Integrity—Initiation of apoptosis is a common response to cytotoxic agents used in cancer chemotherapy. However, neither MT-DADMe-ImmA nor MTA are considered to be cytotoxic agents. It was of interest to determine if the mechanism of apoptosis seen in FaDu cells involved mitochondrial damage. Apoptotic initiation can be mitochondria-dependent or-independent; therefore, mitochondrial membrane integrity was measured by DiOC6 staining. Combined treatment of FaDu cells led to the loss of mitochondrial retention of DiOC6 (Fig. 4C). This is not a consequence of the polyamine depletion, since treatment with 5 mm DFMO did not alter DiOC6 staining (data not shown). In addition to mitochondrial damage, FaDu cells containing apoptotic bodies also showed clumped or fragmented chromatin by Hoechst staining (supplemental Fig. C). We conclude from these results that treatment with MT-DADMe-ImmA + MTA causes G2/M cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial damage in FaDu cells to induce apoptosis. In contrast, no effect is seen in CRL2522 normal human fibroblasts treated in the same way (supplemental Fig. B). Activation of Caspase Pathways—The pathway of apoptosis induced by MT-DADMe-ImmA + MTA was investigated in FaDu cells by analyzing the activation status of initiator and effector caspases and cleavage of the caspase substrate poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Treatment of FaDu cells with MT-DADMe-ImmA and MTA for 4 days caused significant cleavage of caspase-9, -3, and -7 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Fig. 5A). The Bcl2 family members Bcl2 and Bax are markers of mitochondrial integrity, and the Bcl2 and Bax protein levels did not change detectably after treatment (data not shown). Thus, MT-DADM"
https://openalex.org/W2170327822,"Ca2+ is an essential factor inducing keratinocyte differentiation due to the natural Ca2+ gradient in the skin. However, the membrane mechanisms that mediate calcium entry and trigger keratinocyte differentiation had not previously been elucidated. In this study we demonstrate that Ca2+-induced differentiation up-regulates both mRNA and protein expression of a transient receptor potential highly Ca2+-selective channel, TRPV6. The latter mediates Ca2+ uptake and accounts for the basal [Ca2+]i in human keratinocytes. Our results show that TRPV6 is a prerequisite for keratinocyte entry into differentiation, because the silencing of TRPV6 in human primary keratinocytes led to the development of impaired differentiated phenotype triggered by Ca2+. The expression of such differentiation markers as involucrin, transglutaminase-1, and cytokeratin-10 was significantly inhibited by small interfering RNA-TRPV6 as compared with differentiated control cells. TRPV6 silencing affected cell morphology and the development of intercellular contacts, as well as the ability of cells to stratify. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3, a cofactor of differentiation, dose-dependently increased TRPV6 mRNA and protein expression in human keratinocytes. This TRPV6 up-regulation led to a significant increase in Ca2+ uptake in both undifferentiated and differentiated keratinocytes. We conclude that TRPV6 mediates, at least in part, the pro-differentiating effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 by increasing Ca2+ entry, thereby promoting differentiation. Taken together, these data suggest that the TRPV6 channel is a key element in Ca2+/1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced differentiation of human keratinocytes. Ca2+ is an essential factor inducing keratinocyte differentiation due to the natural Ca2+ gradient in the skin. However, the membrane mechanisms that mediate calcium entry and trigger keratinocyte differentiation had not previously been elucidated. In this study we demonstrate that Ca2+-induced differentiation up-regulates both mRNA and protein expression of a transient receptor potential highly Ca2+-selective channel, TRPV6. The latter mediates Ca2+ uptake and accounts for the basal [Ca2+]i in human keratinocytes.

Taken together, these data suggest that the TRPV6 channel is a key element in Ca2+/1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced differentiation of human keratinocytes. Human epidermis is the largest tissue of the body responsible for barrier function and is primarily composed of keratinocytes. Keratinocytes are arranged in highly organized, specialized layers according to their functions and the programmed life cycle. Proliferating keratinocytes comprise the stratum basale. As a result of proliferation, keratinocytes leave the stratum basale, moving toward the exterior with the onset of differentiation in the stratum spinosum. Differentiation is completed in the stratum granulosum, thereby constituting the enucleated stratum corneum, which plays the major role of permeability barrier.A number of auto- and paracrine factors drive keratinocyte differentiation. Calcium and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, an active metabolite of vitamin D, play important roles in this process (1Su M.J. Bikle D.D. Mancianti M.L. Pillai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14723-14729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic Ca2+ signaling is well known to control a wide array of cell functions, ranging from short-term responses such as contraction and secretion to longer-term regulation of cell growth and proliferation (2Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4372) Google Scholar). The epidermis has a calcium gradient, with the lowest concentrations in the stratum basale and the highest in the stratum granulosum, where the proteins critical for barrier function are produced (3Pillai S. Bikle D.D. Mancianti M.L. Cline P. Hincenbergs M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 4Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The keratinocyte response to extracellular calcium, i.e. “calcium switch” that induces differentiation, is not fully understood. This response was considered to be, at least partly, mediated by a calcium receptor identified in keratinocytes (5Bikle D.D. Ratnam A. Mauro T. Harris J. Pillai S. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Indeed, the epidermis of the currently available mouse model with a knocked-out full-length calcium receptor has lower levels of terminal differentiation markers and decreased ability of extracellular calcium to raise intracellular Ca2+ concentration (6Oda Y. Tu C.L. Chang W. Crumrine D. Komuves L. Mauro T. Elias P.M. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1183-1190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this knock-out did not prevent the cells from differentiation to the full extent, suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved.Calcium-permeable channels are potential candidates participating in the increased influx of calcium into keratinocytes (7Mauro T.M. Isseroff R.R. Lasarow R. Pappone P.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 132: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Mauro T.M. Pappone P.A. Isseroff R.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is a transient receptor potential superfamily of cation channels that includes a remarkable spectrum of channels mediating a variety of sensory and receptor-induced signals (9Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar, 10Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V.

Within this superfamily, a member of transient receptor potential subfamily V member 6, TRPV6 5The abbreviations used are: TRPV6, transient receptor potential subfamily V member 6 channel; hPK, human primary keratinocyte; IVL, involucrin; KRT10, cytokeratin 10; TGM1, transglutaminase 1; VDR, vitamin D3 receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 5The abbreviations used are: TRPV6, transient receptor potential subfamily V member 6 channel; hPK, human primary keratinocyte; IVL, involucrin; KRT10, cytokeratin 10; TGM1, transglutaminase 1; VDR, vitamin D3 receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; siRNA, small interfering RNA. is a highly selective Ca2+ channel that has already been shown to be expressed in several tissues, including the intestine, kidney, pancreas, prostate, and testis (11Hoenderop J.G.

Droogmans G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3963-3969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), with high selectivity for Ca2+ (15Hoenderop J.G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. Pflugers. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 446: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and has been shown to be involved in Ca2+ (re)absorption in Ca2+-transporting tissues, including the small intestine and kidney (11Hoenderop J.G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 529-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in these tissues TRPV6 expression is directly up-regulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (16Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W. Urben C.M. Strugnell S.A. Bindels R.J. Kidney Int. 2004; 66: 1082-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Interestingly, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 promotes keratinocyte differentiation via similar pathways as calcium (17Bikle D.D. Gee E. Pillai S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 713-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor (VDR) is critical for the genomic actions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (18Pillai S. Bikle D.D. Elias P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5390-5395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VDR-null mice have also been shown experimentally to exhibit a defect in epidermal differentiation, demonstrated by reduced levels of involucrin (IVL), profilaggrin, and loricrin, as well as the loss of keratohyalin granules (19Xie Z. Komuves L. Yu Q.C. Elalieh H. Ng D.C. Leary C. Chang S. Crumrine D. Yoshizawa T. Kato S. Bikle D.D. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 11-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 also appears to be one of the key regulators of keratinocyte differentiation in vivo.Together, calcium and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 regulate the programmed differentiation process by sequentially turning on and off the genes that produce the elements required for differentiation, as well as activating the enzymes directly involved. However, it is not known yet which of these targets play the role of extracellular Ca2+ sensors or triggers during Ca2+-induced differentiation. We therefore investigated the role of the TRPV6 channel in Ca2+-induced differentiation of human keratinocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line, kindly provided by Prof. B. Dufy, CNRS UNR 5543, Bordeaux, France, was cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, containing 0.07 mm Ca2+, 100 μg/ml kanamycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Human primary keratinocytes (hPKs) were obtained from adult skin after breast reduction surgery as previously described (20Tamiji S. Beauvillain J.C. Mortier L. Jouy N. Tual M. Delaporte E. Formstecher P. Marchetti P. Polakowska R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2005; 125: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), according to the rules of the Medical Center Ethics Committee, Centre Hospitalier Régional Universitaire Lille.Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in air. The medium was changed three times a week, and cultures were split by treating the cells with 0.25% trypsin (in PBS) for 5 min at 37 °C prior to confluency. For the experiments, cells were seeded in 6-well plates for PCR and Western blotting and on glass coverslips for immunocytochemistry and calcium imaging. For the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 studies, cells were treated with EtOH as a solubilizer for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.Throughout this report the terms “undifferentiated” and “differentiated” keratinocytes are used as follows. Cells were cultured in a complete DMEM (HaCaT) or in a Defined-Keratinocyte serum-free medium (SFM) (hPK) containing 0.07 mm Ca2+ (undifferentiated) or 1.8 mm Ca2+ (differentiated), corresponding to the differentiation state of these cells. Generally, for the differentiated phenotype, cells were allowed to attach for 24 h after trypsinization, and then a 0.07 mm Ca2+-containing DMEM (or a Defined-Keratinocyte SFM) was replaced by DMEM with 1.8 mm Ca2+ (or a Defined-Keratinocyte SFM with 1.8 mm Ca2+). After 24–48 h of incubation in the latter medium, cells were considered differentiated and their state was confirmed by PCR and Western blotting of corresponding markers. Human embryonic kidney cells were cultured in complete DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction procedure (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62986) Google Scholar). After DNase I (Invitrogen) treatment to eliminate genomic DNA, 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA at 42 °C, using random hexamer primers (PerkinElmer) and MuLV reverse transcriptase (PerkinElmer) in a 20-μl final volume followed by PCR as described below. The PCR primers used to amplify TRPV6, INV, TGM1, KRT10, VDR, and β-actin cDNAs are specified in Table 1. PCR was performed on the reverse transcription-generated cDNA using a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 thermal cycler (PerkinElmer). To detect different cDNAs, PCR was performed by adding 1 μl of reverse transcription template to a mixture of (final concentrations) 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm each dNTP, 600 nm sense and antisense primers, and 1 unit of AmpliTaq Gold (PerkinElmer) in a final volume of 25 μl. DNA amplification conditions included an initial 5-min denaturation step at 95 °C (which also activated the Gold variant of Taq polymerase) and 33 cycles as follows: 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 59 °C, 30 s at 72 °C, and finally 7 min at 72 °C. Density was measured using “Quantity one” software (Bio-Rad), and the data were analyzed using Origin 7.0 (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA).TABLE 1Primers and siRNANo.Name, NCBI accession no.Forward (5′-...-3′)Backward (5′-...-3′)Expected sizebp1.TRPV6, NM_018646ATGGTGATGCGGCTCATCAGTGGTAGAAGTGGCCTAGCTCCTCG2552.KRT10, NM_000421TAACAACTGATAATGCCAACATAGTGGACACATTTCGAAGGT2603.IVL, NM_005547TCTAAGATGTCCCAGCAACACATCATGCTGTTCCCAGTGCTGTT2924.TGM1, NM_000359GATCGCATCACCCTTGAGTTACTCCTCATGGTCCACGTACACAAT3045.VDR, NM_000376CCAGTTCGTGTGAATGATGGGTCGTCCATGGTGAAGGA3836.β-actin, NM_001101CAGAGCAAGAGAGGCATCCTGTTGAAGGTCTCAAACATGATC2097.TRPV65′-CCUGCUGCAGCAGAAGAGG (dTdT) -3′ (position 111-129 from ATG)siRNA8.TRPV65′-GACUCUCUAUGACCUCACA (dTdT) -3′ (position 825-843 from ATG)siRNA-1 Open table in a new tab siRNA Cell Transfection—Human keratinocytes were transfected overnight with 200 nm siRNA-TRPV6/well in a six-well plate using “Gene porter 2” (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc.) in a final volume of 1 ml. Ready-to-use siRNA-TRPV6 (processing option A4) was synthesized by Dharmacon Research Inc. (see Table 1). Functional non-coding siRNA 1 (Dharmacon Research Inc.) was used as a control.Immunocytochemistry—Cells grown on glass coverslips were washed once with PBS and incubated with cholera toxin subunit B Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugate (1/2000; Molecular Probes) for 15 min and then washed once with PBS and fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS. PBS-glycine (30 mm) was used to quench the reaction, and the subsequent permeabilization was obtained using 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were washed again in PBS and subjected to a conventional immunostaining procedure. Alexa Fluor® 546 or 488 goat anti-rabbit IgGs (1/4000; Molecular Probes) were used as secondary antibodies for TRPV6, or KRT10 and IVL staining, respectively. Fluorescence was analyzed on a Carl Zeiss Laser Scanning Systems LSM 510 connected to a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m with a ×63 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion lens at room temperature. Both channels were excited, collected separately, and then merged to examine colocalization using Carl Zeiss LSM Image Examiner software.Western Blotting—Semiconfluent HaCAT or hPK cells were treated with an ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min, mixed with a sample buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.01% Bromphenol blue, and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Total protein samples were subjected to 8–10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by semi-dry Western blotting (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The membrane was blocked in a 5% milk TNT buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) overnight and then probed using specific rabbit polyclonal anti-TRPV6 antibody (1/200; Alomone Labs Ltd.) and mouse monoclonal anti-cytokeratin 10 (1/1000; Chemicon International), anti-involucrin (1/1000; Sigma-Aldrich), and anti-β-actin (1/1000; Lab Vision Corp.) antibodies. We used enhanced chemiluminescence to visualize the bands on the membrane (Pierce Biotechnologies Inc.). However, this method has a rather narrow linear range and should be used with precautions to make proper quantifications. Densitometric analysis was performed using a Bio-Rad image acquisition system.Calcium Imaging—Cells were plated onto glass coverslips and loaded with 4 μm Fura-2 AM in the growth medium at room temperature for 45 min. Recordings were performed in Hanks’ buffered salt solution containing (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 0.3 Na2HPO3, 0.4 KH2PO4, 4 NaHCO3, 5 glucose, and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. CaCl2 was adjusted to 0.07 or 1.8 mm, depending on the experiment. The coverslips were then placed in a perfusion chamber on the microscope stage. Fluorescence images of the cells were recorded with a video image analysis system (Quanticell). Fura-2 fluorescence at an emission wavelength of 510 nm was recorded by exciting the probe alternately at 340 and 380 nm. The signal ratio at 340/380 nm was converted into [Ca2+]i levels using an in vitro calibration.Reagents—All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified.Statistics—Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analyses were carried out using Student’s unpaired t-tests (two-tailed). p < 0.05 indicates statistical significance.RESULTSCa2+-induced Differentiation and TRPV6 Expression in Human Keratinocytes—Two types of human keratinocytes were selected for our study: HaCaT, a cell line similar in functional competence to normal keratinocytes (22Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar), and human primary keratinocytes (hPK). We initially studied the mRNA expression of keratinocyte differentiation-specific markers such as IVL, transglutaminase 1 (TGM1), and cytokeratin 10 (KRT10) under semiconfluent conditions in the presence of 0.07 or 1.8 mm Ca2+ in DMEM (Fig. 1A). Little, if any, IVL transcript was detected in 0.07 mm Ca2+, whereas IVL mRNA levels increased in the differentiated state. Similarly, TGM1 levels, encoding a rate-limiting enzyme for cornified envelope formation, increased with Ca2+-induced differentiation of HaCaT keratinocytes. KRT10 was especially interesting as a marker of HaCaT differentiation because it was undetectable under 0.07 mm Ca2+ conditions and appeared following Ca2+-induced differentiation. Thus, cells kept in the medium containing 0.07 mm Ca2+ were considered undifferentiated (U), whereas those kept in the medium containing 1.8 mm Ca2+ were considered differentiated (D). This model was justified by using hPK stained for KRT10 (green) and nuclei (blue) to show the ability of hPK to differentiate by expressing KRT10 and forming a supralayer under the above conditions (Fig. 1B).The expression of TRPV6 mRNA in HaCaT cells is apparently differentiation-dependent (Fig. 1). We observed an almost 5-times increase in TRPV6 mRNA in HaCaT cells kept in 1.8 mm Ca2+ for 3 days (the numbers under TRPV6 panel indicate the relative intensities of the bands) as compared with the 0.07 mm Ca2+ condition. Immunoblotting with anti-hTRPV6 antibody (verified using human embryonic kidney cells stably overexpressing TRPV6, Fig. 1C) detected significant increases in TRPV6 protein in both HaCaT and hPK cells following differentiation (Fig. 1, D and E). However, it should be noted that when loaded with more than 20 μg of total protein/well the enhanced chemiluminescence method lost its linearity, compromising quantifications. To confirm our data HaCaT and hPK cells were immunostained with cholera toxin (green), used as a plasma membrane marker, and TRPV6 (red) (Fig. 1F). This experiment (together with Western blot and PCR techniques) confirmed the significant increase in TRPV6 protein levels after Ca2+-induced differentiation.Thus, the expression pattern of differentiation markers such as IVL, TGM1, and KRT10 correlated with the differentiation state of the keratinocytes. TRPV6 is important for keratinocyte differentiation and, to a certain extent, may also represent a differentiation marker.TRPV6 Is a Ca2+ Uptake Channel Contributing to Increase in [Ca2+]i following Keratinocyte Differentiation—To investigate the contribution of TRPV6, as a Ca2+-selective channel, to a calcium influx into keratinocytes during Ca2+-induced differentiation, we recorded the response of the keratinocytes to acute changes in [Ca2+]o from 0 to 1.8 mm by measuring intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2+]i) in cells pretreated with the control and anti-TRPV6 siRNAs (previously validated on the protein level, Fig. 2A). Both undifferentiated and differentiated HaCaT (uHaCaT and dHa-CaT), as well as hPK (uhPK and dhPK), cells responded to the acute changes in [Ca2+]o by increases in [Ca2+]i. This effect was significantly suppressed in the cells treated with siRNA-TRPV6 (Fig. 2, B–F). We also checked whether this acute calcium uptake was specific to TRPV6 by using anti-TRPC7 oligo-RNA (Fig. 2G). This anti-TRPC7 oligo-RNA induced the extinction of the corresponding protein but the acute response to the [Ca2+]o increase was not affected, suggesting that TRPV6 plays a specific role in this process. TRPV5, a Ca2+-selective TRP channel very similar to TRPV6, was not expressed in either keratinocyte species (data not shown), indicating that the above effects were explicitly confined to TRPV6. These data suggest that TRPV6 is a constitutively open channel responsible for mediating the cytoplasmic Ca2+ increase in response to an increase in extracellular Ca2+ concentrations, i.e. a “Ca2+ switch”.FIGURE 2TRPV6 is a constitutively open Ca2+ channel. Human keratinocytes were pretransfected with siRNA-TRPV6s, incubated for 3 days, and then loaded with Fura-2AM Ca2+ probe, and [Ca2+]i was measured.

Both HaCaT and hPK cells grown at 0.07 mm Ca2+ were transfected with siRNA-TRPV6, incubated for 3 days, and then subjected to a Ca2+ switch for 24 h. The effects of TRPV6 silencing on Ca2+-induced differentiation of human keratinocytes, indicated by the expression of differentiation-specific markers, are shown in Fig. 3. TRPV6 silencing significantly depressed mRNA levels of IVL, TGM1, and KRT10 as compared with non-transfected differentiated hPK and HaCaT cells treated with Ca2+ under the same conditions (Fig. 3, A and B). Quantitative histograms depicting the effects of TRPV6 silencing on the expression of differentiation markers normalized to their levels in undifferentiated keratinocytes are shown in Fig. 3, C and D. Western blotting of the key differentiation markers such as IVL and KRT10 was also used to confirm the effects of TRPV6 silencing on protein levels (Fig. 3E).FIGURE 3TRPV6 is essential for differentiation of human keratinocytes. HaCaT or hPK cells were transfected with siRNA-TRPV6, incubated for 3 days, and subjected to calcium switch for 24 h (dHaCaT-TRPV6 or dhPK-TRPV6).

Light microscopy examination showed that TRPV6 silencing significantly affected the ability of the cells to change their shape and develop cell-to-cell interactions (Fig. 4Aa). Black arrows indicate the closing of cell-to-cell contacts among three adjacent cells. As can be seen from Fig. 4Aa, in low Ca2+ conditions the membranes of the cells are not closed, leaving enough spare space among them. In high Ca2+ conditions the membranes are in complete contact with one another. TRPV6 knock down also impairs the ability of the cells to form complete closed contacts among three adjacent cells. The cell shape is also likely to be affected by TRPV6 knock down, which prevents the cells switching from well rounded to flattened form allowing assembly of monolayer epidermal sheets. The other important criterion in assessing keratinocyte differentiation is the ability of keratinocyte monolayers to stratify. Immunocytochemistry of the confluent HaCaT cells co-stained with anti-TRPV6 (red) and anti-KRT10 or anti-IVL antibody (green) revealed that the ability of keratinocytes to form a supralayer of differentiated cells was impaired (Fig. 4, Ab and Ac). The quantitative effects of TRPV6 silencing are demonstrated in the corresponding histogram (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that TRPV6 is an essential component in inducing human keratinocyte differentiation.FIGURE 4TRPV6 silencing affects keratinocyte morphology upon Ca2+ switch.

The effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (0.1–500 nm) on TRPV6 mRNA expression levels in undifferentiated and differentiated semiconfluent human keratinocytes are shown in Fig. 5. HaCaT cells were kept in either 0.07 or 1.8 mm [Ca2+]o for at least 3 days and then incubated with the corresponding concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for 3 days. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 increased the expression of TRPV6 mRNA transcripts in human keratinocytes in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5, A and B).

https://openalex.org/W1970953058,"Our model of phospholamban (PLB) regulation of the cardiac Ca2+-ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a) states that PLB binds to the Ca2+-free, E2 conformation of SERCA2a and blocks it from transitioning from E2 to E1, the Ca2+-bound state. PLB and Ca2+ binding to SERCA2a are mutually exclusive, and PLB inhibition of SERCA2a is manifested as a decreased apparent affinity of SERCA2a for Ca2+. Here we extend this model to explain the reversal of SERCA2a inhibition that occurs after phosphorylation of PLB at Ser16 by protein kinase A (PKA) and after binding of the anti-PLB monoclonal antibody 2D12, which recognizes residues 7–13 of PLB. Site-specific cysteine variants of PLB were co-expressed with SERCA2a, and the effects of PKA phosphorylation and 2D12 on Ca2+-ATPase activity and cross-linking to SERCA2a were monitored. In Ca2+-ATPase assays, PKA phosphorylation and 2D12 partially and completely reversed SERCA2a inhibition by decreasing KCa values for enzyme activation, respectively. In cross-linking assays, cross-linking of PKA-phosphorylated PLB to SERCA2a was inhibited at only two of eight sites when conducted in the absence of Ca2+ favoring E2. However, at a subsaturating Ca2+ concentration supporting some E1, cross-linking of phosphorylated PLB to SERCA2a was attenuated at all eight sites. KCa values for cross-linking inhibition were decreased nearly 2-fold at all sites by PLB phosphorylation, demonstrating that phosphorylated PLB binds more weakly to SERCA2a than dephosphorylated PLB. In parallel assays, 2D12 blocked PLB cross-linking to SERCA2a at all eight sites regardless of Ca2+ concentration. Our results demonstrate that 2D12 restores maximal Ca2+-ATPase activity by physically disrupting the binding interaction between PLB and SERCA2a. Phosphorylation of PLB by PKA weakens the binding interaction between PLB and SERCA2a (yielding more PLB-free SERCA2a molecules at intermediate Ca2+ concentrations), only partially restoring Ca2+ affinity and Ca2+-ATPase activity.

Phosphorylation of PLB at Ser16 by PKA during β-agonist activation of the heart partially reverses PLB inhibition of SERCA2a, resulting in increased Ca2+ uptake and release by SR and substantially augmented contractile dynamics (1Simmerman H.K.B.

Lindemann J.P. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11468-11474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the physiological role of phosphorylation at this site is less clear (8Mattiazzi A. Mundina-Weilenmann C. Guoxiang C. Vittone L. Kranias E. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 68: 366-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanism by which phosphorylation of PLB reverses SERCA2a inhibition is of wide interest, both scientifically and from a therapeutic standpoint (9Schmidt A.G. Edes I. Kranias E.G. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 2001; 15: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PLB inhibits the cardiac Ca2+ pump by decreasing its apparent affinity for Ca2+, having little or no effect on the Vmax of the enzyme measured at saturating Ca2+ concentration (1Simmerman H.K.B. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PLB at Ser16 by PKA partially reverses its inhibitory effect on the apparent Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2a. Interestingly, anti-PLB monoclonal antibodies targeted near the phosphorylation site of PLB also reverse SERCA2a inhibition, but more completely than PKA phosphorylation of PLB (10Kimura Y. Inui M.

Jones L.R. Morad M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261 (–H1349): H1344PubMed Google Scholar). Although both PKA phosphorylation of PLB and binding of anti-PLB antibodies stimulate SERCA2a activity by increasing the apparent affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+, the detailed molecular mechanism(s) by which this occurs has proven difficult to solve, since the original observation of the phosphorylation effect by Tada et al. (13Tada M. Kirchberger M.A. Repke D.I. Katz A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6174-6180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) more than 30 years ago. In this report we address this issue directly. A simple mechanism to explain PLB inhibition of SERCA2a is that the enzyme cannot transport Ca2+ when PLB is bound. This idea is strongly supported by recent cross-linking results in which the binding of PLB to SERCA2a at several sites distributed throughout both molecules was detected (14Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Rice W.J. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 14163-14172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Based on these cross-linking results, we proposed the following model (Scheme 1) to explain the inhibitory action of PLB on SERCA2a. E2ċPLB↔PLBE2↔E1↔Ca2+E1ċCa2+1 Binding of PLB and Ca2+ to SERCA2a is mutually exclusive. PLB binds to the E2 conformation of SERCA2a, the low Ca2+ affinity state, whereas Ca2+ binds to the E1 conformation of SERCA2a, the high Ca2+ affinity state. Consistent with this, cross-linking of PLB to SERCA2a at all previously established sites at both cytoplasmic and transmembrane residues of PLB is completely abolished by micromolar Ca2+ stabilizing E1. We further proposed, based on cross-linking data, that PLB binds specifically to the E2-ATP conformation of the enzyme, physically blocking its transition from E2 to E1 (14Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Rice W.J. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 14163-14172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Finally, we postulated that for the kinetic cycle to proceed, PLB must fully dissociate from SERCA2a to allow E1 formation, the high Ca2+ affinity conformation that actively hydrolyzes ATP. Therefore, when the enzyme is actively transporting Ca2+, this competition between PLB and Ca2+ for binding to E2 and E1, respectively, is manifested as a decrease in apparent affinity of SERCA2a for Ca2+, as suggested in earlier kinetic experiments (18Cantilina T. Sagara Y. Inesi G. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17018-17025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking results from two other groups also suggested that E1·Ca2+ is incapable of binding PLB (19Toyoshima C. Asahi M. Sugita Y. Khanna R. Tsuda T. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 20James P. Inui M. Tada M. Chiesi M. Carafoli E. Nature. 1989; 342: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), which is in contrast to recent claims of others that PLB remains tightly associated with SERCA2a throughout the entire reaction cycle (21Li J. Xiong Y. Bigelow D.J. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Mueller B. Karim C.B. Negrashov I.V. Kutchai H. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8754-8765Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As noted above, the molecular mechanism by which phosphorylation of PLB or anti-PLB monoclonal antibodies reverse PLB inhibition of SERCA2a remains unclear. In recent studies in which the physical interactions between the two molecules were examined directly, phosphorylation of PLB by PKA has been reported to either increase its dissociation from SERCA2a (14Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Toyoshima C. Asahi M. Sugita Y. Khanna R. Tsuda T. MacLennan D.H. Proc.

Nature. 1989; 342: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) or to have no effect (21Li J. Xiong Y. Bigelow D.J. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Asahi M. McKenna E. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Biol. 2006; 358: 1032-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We observed that both phosphorylation of PLB by PKA and the anti-PLB antibody, 2D12 (which recognizes residues 7–13 of PLB), reduce chemical cross-linking of PLB to SERCA2a when the two proteins are co-expressed (14Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Rice W.J. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 10530-10539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that PLB binding to SERCA2a is attenuated when phosphorylated or bound with antibody. A weakened physical interaction between PLB and SERCA2a would readily explain the increase in apparent Ca2+ affinity of the enzyme that ensues, according to the model described above. However, in other studies in which the physical interactions between PLB and SERCA have been monitored, either by immunoprecipitation (23Asahi M. McKenna E. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15034-15038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), or by fluorescence probe (21Li J. Xiong Y. Bigelow D.J. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24Li J. Bigelow D.J. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10674-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or spin labeling (25Karim C.B. Zhang Z. Howard E.C. Torgersen K.D. Thomas D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 1032-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) of purified-reconstituted proteins, no effect of PLB phosphorylation on association of the two proteins was noted, and it was therefore concluded that Ser16 phosphorylation of PLB must reverse SERCA2a inhibition by a mechanism other than by decreasing PLB binding affinity. Clearly, it is important to determine whether phosphorylation of PLB decreases its binding affinity for SERCA2a in order to understand the molecular mechanism by which PKA reverses enzyme inhibition. In this study, we examined the effects of PKA phosphorylation of PLB and 2D12 on the cross-linking of PLB to SERCA2a at both cytoplasmic and transmembrane residues, and we correlated these results with Ca2+ activation of ATPase activity. The results are entirely consistent with our model of mutually exclusive binding of Ca2+ and PLB to SERCA2a (Scheme 1). We conclude that phosphorylation of PLB by PKA weakens its binding interaction with SERCA2a, giving a partial stimulation of Ca2+-ATPase activity at low ionized Ca2+ concentration, whereas 2D12 virtually completely dissociates PLB from SERCA2a, giving the maximal increase in Ca2+-ATPase activity possible.

Protein Expression—Sf21 insect cells were co-infected with baculoviruses encoding PLB and SERCA2a proteins as described previously (5Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Microsomes were harvested 60 h after co-infection and stored frozen in small aliquots at –40 °C at a protein concentration of 6–10 mg/ml in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0). Protein assay was by the Lowry method. PLB was expressed at ∼4:1 molar ratio to SERCA2a (14Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of PLB by PKA—Prior to experiments, the catalytic subunit of PKA was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) to eliminate DTT, phosphate, and EDTA. Control experiments revealed that the dialyzed protein remained fully functional. Phosphorylation of PLB in Sf21 membranes was performed in a master mix containing 80 units of dialyzed catalytic subunit of PKA with 110 μg of microsomal protein in 100 μl of 40 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 3.2 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, and 3 mm ATP. Phosphorylation was conducted for 10 min at 30 °C, and then 11-μg aliquots of pre-phosphorylated or control (minus catalytic subunit) membranes were diluted into concentrated Ca2+/EGTA buffers to yield the final concentrations below for cross-linking experiments or for Ca2+-ATPase assays. In experiments in which PLB was pre-labeled at Ser16 with PKA and [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 4), 25 μm [γ-32P]ATP was substituted for 3 mm cold ATP in the phosphorylation reaction. The membranes were then cross-linked in normal buffer containing 3 mm nonradioactive ATP. Inclusion of phosphatase inhibitors did not have any effect on PLB phosphorylation, which was complete; so for most experiments, phosphatase inhibitors were not added. Heat-inactivated PKA was made by heating PKA to 100 °C for 5 min. Cross-linking—Cross-linking between Cys residues of PLB and Cys or Lys residues of SERCA2a was conducted using homobifunctional thiol (BMH and bBBr) and heterobifunctional thiol to amine (EMCS and KMUS) cross-linking reagents, respectively, as described previously (14Jones L.R.

Reactions were conducted with 11 μg of microsomal protein pre-phosphorylated in the presence or absence of catalytic subunit of PKA as described above in 12 μl of 40 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 3.2 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, and 3 mm ATP supplemented with Ca2+/EGTA. The final concentration of EGTA was fixed at 1 mm, and ionized calcium concentrations were set by adding CaCl2 from 0 to 1 mm (5Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Cross-linking reactions were conducted at room temperature with 0.1 mm final cross-linker concentrations added from concentrated stock solutions in Me2SO and terminated by adding 7.5 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT (14Jones L.R.

Specific cross-linking agents used and cross-linking times to achieve maximal cross-linking are indicated in the figure legends. After terminating the reactions, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-PLB monoclonal antibody 1F1 to detect PLB cross-linked to SERCA2a. 1F1 was raised to residues 1–10 of PLB and recognizes phosphorylated and dephosphorylated PLB equally well (14Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Antibody visualization was with 125I-protein A except in experiments in which 2D12 effects on cross-linking were assessed (Fig. 5). In this case, blots were probed with 125I-2D12 to circumvent protein A binding to nonradioactive 2D12 carried over from the cross-linking reactions. In experiments in which PLB was 32P-labeled and cross-linked to SERCA2a, proteins were also transferred to nitrocellulose after SDS-PAGE. 125I-and 32P-labeled bands on nitrocellulose sheets were visualized by autoradiography and then quantified with a Bio-Rad Personal Fx PhosphorImager. Data analysis was done with Origin (Microcal). Ca2+-ATPase Assay—Ca2+-dependent ATPase activities of insect cell microsomes co-expressing PLB and SERCA2a were measured using an enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay (26Cornea R.L. Autry J.M. Chen Z. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The rate of NADH decay was measured at 340 nm in a SPECTRAmax® PLUS (Molecular Devices) microplate spectrophotometer at 37 °C with 11 μg of membrane protein in buffer containing 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm NaN3, 3 μg/ml of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, 3 mm ATP, and Ca/EGTA as described above. Ca2+-ATPase activities were measured in the presence and absence of anti-PLB monoclonal antibody 2D12 or with prior phosphorylation of PLB at Ser16 by PKA. All ATPase activities reported are Ca2+-dependent. PLB Phosphorylation and 2D12 Effects on SERCA2a Activity—In a series of studies, we used Cys-scanning mutagenesis of PLB to identify several residues located within both the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of PLB that cross-link to SERCA2a (14Jones L.R.

Prior to analyzing the effects of PLB phosphorylation and the anti-PLB antibody 2D12 on cross-linking at these sites, we determined whether 2D12 and phosphorylation of these mutants altered their ability to inhibit Ca2+-ATPase activity, as has been demonstrated previously for WT-PLB (5Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a typical Ca2+ dose-response curve on Ca2+-ATPase activity for one of the PLB mutants tested, N30C-PLB, when it was co-expressed with the Ca2+ pump in insect cell microsomes. N30C-PLB inhibited SERCA2a by shifting the Ca2+ activation curve to the right (Fig. 1, open triangles), yielding a KCa value of 0.35 μm, compared with 0.13 μm when SERCA2a was expressed alone (open squares). Phosphorylation of N30C-PLB at Ser16 by PKA shifted the curve to the left (Fig. 1, partially closed triangles), decreasing the KCa value to 0.25 μm, and thus partially restoring the higher apparent Ca2+ affinity of the Ca2+ pump. In contrast, 2D12 almost completely reversed N30C-PLB inhibition of the Ca2+-ATPase (Fig. 1, closed triangles), lowering the KCa value to 0.16 μm, which is similar to the KCa value obtained when SERCA2a was expressed by itself. The more complete reversal of PLB inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity by monoclonal antibodies, compared with PKA phosphorylation of PLB, was previously demonstrated with native SR vesicles (10Kimura Y.

Similar results were obtained for all other PLB mutants tested that cross-link to SERCA2a, with KCa values from multiple determinations listed in Table 1. For comparison, KCa values for WT-PLB co-expressed with SERCA2a are also shown, and fall within the same range. Notably,"
https://openalex.org/W1987976359,"In this study, distinct roles of de novo-generated endogenous ceramides and mechanisms by which deacetylated Sp3 regulates the hTERT promoter activity in response to ceramide signaling were explored. The generation of C18-ceramide via the expression of ceramide synthase 1 (CerS1), and not C16-ceramide by CerS5 or CerS6 expression, resulted in repression of the hTERT promoter via deacetylation of Sp3 by histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Then roles and mechanisms of action of ceramide-mediated deacetylation of Sp3 in inhibiting the hTERT promoter were determined using constitutively deacetylated or acetylated Sp3 mutants at lysine (K) 551. Expression of the deacetylated Sp3 mutant resulted in repression, whereas its acetylated mutant induced basal hTERT promoter activity in Drosophila S2 cells, which do not express any endogenous Sp3, and in A549 cells. Remarkably, chromatin immunoprecipitation data revealed that acetylated Sp3 mutant (K551Q-Sp3) did not bind whereas deacetylated Sp3 (K551R-Sp3) mutant bound strongly to the promoter DNA, resulting in the recruitment of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and inhibition of the association of RNA polymerase II with the promoter. Mechanistically, increased generation of C18-ceramide by hCerS1 expression, but not by its catalytically inactive mutant, mediated the association and recruitment of the deacetylated Sp3/HDAC1 complex to the hTERT promoter DNA, resulting in the local histone H3 deacetylation and repression of the promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2045500321,"Cryptochromes are sensory blue light receptors mediating various responses in plants and animals. Studies on the mechanism of plant cryptochromes have been focused on the flowering plant Arabidopsis. In the genome of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a single plant cryptochrome, Chlamydomonas photolyase homologue 1 (CPH1), has been identified. The N-terminal 500 amino acids comprise the light-sensitive domain of CPH1 linked to a C-terminal extension of similar size. We have expressed the light-sensitive domain heterologously in Escherichia coli in high yield and purity. The 59-kDa protein bears exclusively flavin adenine dinucleotide in its oxidized state. Illumination with blue light induces formation of a neutral flavin radical with absorption maxima at 540 and 580 nm. The reaction proceeds aerobically even in the absence of an exogenous electron donor, which suggests that it reflects a physiological response. The process is completely reversible in the dark and exhibits a decay time constant of 200 s in the presence of oxygen. Binding of ATP strongly stabilizes the radical state after illumination and impedes the dark recovery. Thus, ATP binding has functional significance for plant cryptochromes and does not merely result from structural homology to DNA photolyase. The light-sensitive domain responds to illumination by an increase in phosphorylation. The autophosphorylation takes place although the protein is lacking its native C-terminal extension. This finding indicates that the extension is dispensable for autophosphorylation, despite the role it has been assigned in mediating signal transduction in Arabidopsis.

Blue light governs many responses of organisms to environmental conditions. Cryptochromes have been shown to act as sensory blue light photoreceptors in plants and animals, with their action being as diverse as their origin (1Cashmore A.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 537-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). From sequence analysis, cryptochromes have been divided into three subgroups: animal, plant, and DASH cryptochromes (2Brudler R. Hitomi K. Daiyasu H. Toh H. Kucho K. Ishiura M. Kanehisa M.

Animal cryptochrome synchronizes the circadian clock of Drosophila to the 24-h rhythm (3Stanewsky R. Kaneko M. Emery P. Beretta B. Wager-Smith K. Kay S.A. Rosbash M. Hall J.C.

DASH cryptochromes are mostly found in bacteria but also in Neurospora crassa, aquatic vertebrates (9Daiyasu H. Ishikawa T. Kuma K. Iwai S. Todo T. Toh H. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 479-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and Arabidopsis (AtCRY3) (10Kleine T. Lockhart P. Batschauer A. Plant J. 2003; 35: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Their putative role as sensory receptors has recently been challenged by showing that they act as repair enzymes for single-stranded DNA (11Selby C.P. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 17696-17700Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The 500 N-terminal amino acids constitute the photolyase homology region (PHR) with reference to the DNA repairing enzyme. In this domain all cryptochromes characterized so far carry flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as light-sensitive chromophore (2Brudler R. Hitomi K. Daiyasu H. Toh H. Kucho K. Ishiura M. Kanehisa M.

Science. 1995; 269: 968-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Similarity in structure to the photolyases suggests that 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) might be bound as a second (antenna) chromophore. However, only a few preparations of plant cryptochromes contain MTHF (14Malhotra K. Kim S.T. Batschauer A. Dawut L. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6892-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), which might be explained by a reduced affinity to the altered binding pocket (15Brautigam C.A. Smith B.S. Ma Z. Palnitkar M. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12142-12147Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Plant cryptochromes are characterized by a long C-terminal extension that varies considerably in size and sequence. Fusion of the extension with β-glucuronidase leads to a constitutively active phenotype for AtCRY1 and AtCRY2, which implies a role of this domain for signal transduction (16Yang H.Q. Wu Y.J. Tang R.H. Liu D. Liu Y. Cashmore A.R. Cell. 2000; 103: 815-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). All spectroscopic data on the blue light response of plant cryptochromes have been recorded on Arabidopsis cryptochromes. Interpretation of the data has been facilitated by the availability of a crystal structure of the AtCRY1-PHR domain (15Brautigam C.A. Smith B.S. Ma Z. Palnitkar M. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12142-12147Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In AtCRY1, absorption of blue light induces formation of a neutral flavin radical, which decays on a millisecond time scale (17Giovani B. Byrdin M. Ahmad M. Brettel K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Results from fluorescence and electron paramagnetic resonance experiments on whole insect cells containing AtCRY1 indicate that the radical is the active state of the receptor in vivo (18Bouly J.P. Schleicher E. Dionisio-Sese M. Vandenbussche F. Van Der Straeten D. Bakrim N. Meier S. Batschauer A. Galland P. Bittl R. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9383-9391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This radical shows a unique spectroscopic signature in the visible and infrared spectral region that distinguishes it from that of the homologous photolyases (19Kottke T. Batschauer A. Ahmad M. Heberle J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Results from transient absorption spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis showed that a conserved tryptophan triad and a tyrosine residue are involved in the electron transfer process (17Giovani B. Byrdin M. Ahmad M. Brettel K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 20Zeugner A. Byrdin M. Bouly J.P. Bakrim N. Giovani B. Brettel K. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19437-19440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It was concluded from infrared difference spectroscopy that a crucial step for photoactivation is the protonation of the chromophore by a nearby aspartic acid (19Kottke T. Batschauer A. Ahmad M. Heberle J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Further downstream in the signal cascade, blue light induces autophosphorylation of AtCRY1 in vitro and in vivo (21Bouly J.P. Giovani B. Djamei A. Mueller M. Zeugner A. Dudkin E.A. Batschauer A. Ahmad M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Shalitin D. Yu X. Maymon M. Mockler T. Lin C.

Science. 2001; 294: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). A single putative member of the plant cryptochrome family has been identified in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlamydomonas photolyase homologue 1 CPH1). As a possible evolutionary precursor of plants (25Lariguet P. Dunand C. J. Mol. Evol. 2005; 61: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the CPH1 gene product is closely related to AtCRY1 with 49% identity in the first 500 amino acids (26Small G.D. Min B. Lefebvre P.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 28: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CPH1 contains by far the longest C-terminal extension (507 amino acids) compared with all known cryptochromes (7Lin C. Shalitin D. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 469-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Initial expression of full-length CPH1 yielded a 110-kDa product from E. coli but 126- and 143-kDa proteins from Chlamydomonas as revealed by Western blot analysis (27Reisdorph N.A. Small G.D. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1546-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Size discrepancies were hypothesized to be due to posttranslational modifications. In vivo, CPH1 undergoes light-induced proteolysis (27Reisdorph N.A. Small G.D. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1546-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but the physiological function of CPH1 remains elusive. It has been suggested that CPH1 is involved in regulation of gene transcription and/or circadian phototaxis rhythmicity (27Reisdorph N.A. Small G.D. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1546-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here, we report on a high yield production of the light-sensitive domain of C. reinhardtii cryptochrome in E. coli. Blue light induces formation of the radical state similar to full-length Arabidopsis CRY1. We demonstrate that ATP binding strongly influences the properties of the domain and enables light-induced auto-phosphorylation in the absence of the C-terminal domain. DNA manipulation, cloning, and transformation of E. coli were done by standard techniques (28Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. CSHL Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotech or Invitrogen. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs, Invitrogen, or Fermentas. Sequencing of DNA was performed by dideoxy sequencing using Thermo Sequenase fluorescent-labeled primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and the LI-COR 4200 Gene ReadIR (MWG Biotech). 5, 10-Methenyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) was a kind gift from Dr. R. Moser (Merck Eprova AG). Construction of Expression Vector—The sequence encoding the N-terminal 504 amino acids of CPH1 from C. reinhardtii (NCBI accession code L07561) was amplified by PCR. A coding region for six histidines was added downstream to the start codon. The PCR product was ligated into pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen). E. coli strain TOP10 (Invitrogen) was used for genetic manipulations. The construct was cloned into a modified pET11a (Novagen) expression vector providing the coding sequence for a3′-terminal Strep tag II (WSHPQFEK) after an NheI site coding for alanine and serine. Protein Expression and Purification—E. coli BL21 (DE 3) pLysE (Novagen) containing the expression construct was grown in lysogeny broth medium supplemented with 200 mg/liters ampicillin and 200 μm riboflavin at 37 °C in the dark. When the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.5, the temperature was lowered to 18 °C. At an optical density of 0.7, isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 10 μm. After 20 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (6,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.2 m Tris, pH 8, 0.3 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science) and DNase. The cells were disintegrated using French Press (3 × 1000 psi). The lysate was centrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C) and loaded onto a Strep-Tactin-Sepharose column (IBA). After washing with 0.2 m Tris, pH 8, 0.3 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, the protein was eluted in the same buffer supplied with 2.5 mm d-desthiobiotin. The isolated holoprotein is stable for several days at 4 °C. Protein Analysis—The construct was detected on Western blot (28Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. CSHL Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) using an antibody against the Strep tag (IBA) and the Strep tag horseradish peroxidase detection kit (IBA) or an antibody against the polyhistidine tag (Sigma) and Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). MALDI-TOF analysis was performed after in-gel digestion with trypsin as described previously (29Schaffer S. Weil B. Nguyen V.D. Dongmann G. Gunther K. Nickolaus M. Hermann T. Bott M. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 4404-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For determination of the protein concentration, the protein was diluted in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride. The extinction coefficient of the apoprotein at 280 nm was calculated with ProtParam (www.expasy.org). A chromophore content of up to 70% was estimated by the ratio A280/A450 using an extinction coefficient for FAD in solution of 11300 m–1 cm–1 at 450 nm (30Siegel L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Folate Assay—In a modified fluorescence assay for folate (31Johnson J.L. Hamm-Alvarez S. Payne G. Sancar G.B. Rajagopalan K.V. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2046-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), CPH1-PHR was treated as follows. 0.2 μl of concentrated HCl was added to 25 μl of sample and heated for 3 min at 99 °C. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant diluted to 200 μl. In the next step, sodium hydroxide (10 m) was added until pH 12–13 was reached. Finally, the sample was oxidized by 10 μl of a KI/I2 (20%/10%) solution and overnight incubation. After each step, fluorescence spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu RF 1501 spectrofluorophotometer. Photoreduction and Kinetics of Recovery—UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Uvikon 943 (Kontron Instruments) or a Shimadzu 2401 PC spectrophotometer. The buffer was exchanged to 0.2 m Tris, pH 8, 0.3 m NaCl, 20% glycerol prior to photoreduction, and the sample was kept at 10 °C. MgCl2 was added to 17 mm. The influence of ATP was investigated in the presence of 3.3 mm ATP, 3.3 mm GTP, or 3.3 mm adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). A 445-nm light-emitting diode (22 nm full width at half maximum; Luxeon Star Lumileds) was used for illumination with 25 milliwatt/cm2 at the sample. Between two illuminations, a dark time of 4 min was applied. For kinetic measurements, the change in absorbance at 450 nm was monitored. 2-Mercaptoethanol was added to 20 mm. Oxygen was bubbled through the sample for 5 min prior to 10 s of illumination with the 457-nm light-emitting diode (20 nm full width at half maximum, 40 milliwatt/cm2). ATP was added to 3.3 mm and MgCl2 to 17 mm, if used. Phosphorylation Assay—The recombinant protein isolated from E. coli was dephosphorylated in the dark. Phosphatase treatment was performed at 4 °C for 2.5 h in a buffer containing 36 μm CPH1-PHR, 40 mm Tris, 40 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 8% glycerol, 5 mm KCl, 10 μm ZnCl2, and 7.5 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) (Fermentas). After the treatment, 10 μl of 1.7 mm Na3VO4 for inhibition of the CIAP (32Zueva N.N. Dalev P.G. Lazarova D.L. Biokhimiia. 1993; 58: 1009-1023PubMed Google Scholar), 10 μlof 100 mm MgCl2, and 10 μl of 33 mm ATP were added to 70 μlof the sample solution. All samples were kept at 25 °C and shaken in a thermomixer at 500–1000 rpm (Eppendorf). To prevent heating of the sample by irradiation, a 457-nm light-emitting diode was used (20 nm full width at half maximum; Luxeon Star Lumileds). It provided 77 microwatt/cm2 of blue light at the sample. Dark samples were covered with aluminum foil. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (28Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. CSHL Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) containing 0.4 m dithiothreitol, 8 m urea, 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and by boiling for 15 min at 95 °C. These harsh denaturing conditions were applied to ensure complete dissociation of ATP from the protein. After performing electrophoresis with a 12% polyacrylamide gel, phosphorylated protein was stained with the Pro-Q Diamond Phosphoprotein Gel Stain (Molecular Probes) (33Schulenberg B. Aggeler R. Beechem J.M. Capaldi R.A. Patton W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27251-27255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and detected with 302 nm UV light (Gel Doc; Bio-Rad). Total protein was made visible afterward by Coomassie staining. Signal strength in the phosphostain was analyzed in reference to the background and normalized to the protein amount from the Coomassie stain by ImageJ software (NIH Image, rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/index.html). CPH1 from the unicellular green alga C. reinhardtii is a member of the plant cryptochrome family according to sequence analysis. Its function and properties are unknown; therefore we set out to study the biochemical and spectroscopic characteristics of the CPH1 light-sensitive domain. Construction of the Expression Vector—The 504-amino acid boundary of the N-terminal photolyase-like domain was determined using sequence alignment and available structural data of AtCRY1 and E. coli DNA photolyase in conjunction with secondary structure prediction and hydropathy analysis. Sequencing of the cDNA revealed a deviation in the construct as compared with the published sequence. Codon 314 was found to be cgc instead of ggc, which would result in a mutation from Gly to Arg. In a control experiment, genomic DNA from a C. reinhardtii extract (P. Hegemann, Berlin, Germany) was used as a PCR template to amplify a part of the CPH1 sequence containing codon 314. The PCR product was cloned and analyzed by sequencing, confirming the deviation from the published sequence. This implies that amino acid at position 314 of CPH1 is indeed arginine. Protein Expression and Purification—Using standard expression conditions for E. coli (37°C, 3 h, 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside), the protein was obtained in insoluble form as inclusion bodies. It was solubilized with 1% N-lauroylsarcosine and further purified. However, attempts to reconstitute the protein with FAD as a chromophore were not successful. Modification of the protocol to very mild expression conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) yielded up to 20 mg of a soluble, yellow-colored protein/liter of induced cell culture. SDS-PAGE showed a band at ∼60 kDa with a purity of >90% (Fig. 1, lanes A and C). The experimentally determined molecular mass corresponds to the theoretical mass of the apoprotein of 59.13 kDa. The recombinant protein was detected using antibodies against the N-terminal polyhistidine tag and the C-terminal Strep tag (Fig. 1, lanes B and D). The identity of the CPH1-PHR construct was further confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The protein was subjected to tryptic digestion. Matched peptides covered 21% (109/520 amino acids) of the construct (data not shown). Identification of the Chromophores—A yellow protein was obtained after affinity chromatography. The UV-visible spectrum showed a fine-structured (“three-finger”) absorption band in the 400–500-nm region and a broad absorption in the 300–400-nm region with maxima at 368 and 449 nm (Fig. 2A). These are typical features of an oxidized flavoprotein. As heterologously expressed flavoproteins may incorporate different flavins such as riboflavin, FMN, or FAD (34Laan W. Bednarz T. Heberle J. Hellingwerf K.J. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the chemical nature of the cofactor was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy. CPH1-PHR was heat denatured, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. Before and after denaturation, fluorescence excitation spectra with emission at 528 nm and emission spectra with excitation at 450 nm were recorded (Fig. 2B). Maxima were detected at 364 and 448 nm in the excitation spectrum and at 529 nm in the emission. Upon acidification with HCl the fluorescence signal of the free chromophore rose approximately by 4-fold (Fig. 2B). This rise is a peculiarity of FAD caused by a loss of interaction between the adenine and flavin ring systems in acidic solution (35Faeder E.J. Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In a more quantitative approach, the chromophore composition was further analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Using authentic FAD as a standard, the isolated chromophore showed a signal at the same height without contributions from other flavin species (supplemental Fig. S1). The results from UV-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and TLC analysis identified oxidized FAD as the exclusive flavin chromophore of CPH1. It has been reported that AtCRY1 contains MTHF as a second chromophore (14Malhotra K. Kim S.T. Batschauer A. Dawut L. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6892-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), which is absent in most preparations (15Brautigam C.A. Smith B.S. Ma Z. Palnitkar M. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12142-12147Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 19Kottke T. Batschauer A. Ahmad M. Heberle J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As CPH1 is highly homologous to AtCRY1, CPH1 might also bind MTHF. The chromophore was separated from the CPH1-PHR apoprotein and investigated with a fluorescence assay for folates (31Johnson J.L. Hamm-Alvarez S. Payne G. Sancar G.B. Rajagopalan K.V. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2046-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Upon excitation at 350 nm, the fluorescence spectrum showed a prominent flavin emission at 528 nm. Additionally, a weak band at 441 nm was present, which is indicative for folates. The supernatant was basified by sodium hydroxide and finally oxidized by adding KI/I2. The decay of the 441 nm fluorescence after addition of base and the subsequent strong increase by oxidation are strong indications for the presence of a folate as a second chromophore in CPH1. Bases catalyze the hydrolysis of the methenyl bridge of MTHF to the nonfluorescent 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (31Johnson J.L. Hamm-Alvarez S. Payne G. Sancar G.B. Rajagopalan K.V. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2046-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The oxidizing agent then produces fluorescent products. It should be pointed out, however, that the amount of detected folate was minute and it was only observed in a few preparations. The Response of the Chromophore to Blue Light Illumination—The effect of blue light on CPH1-PHR was followed by UV-visible spectroscopy under aerobic conditions without external electron donor. Illumination at λ = 445 nm caused a decrease of the absorption band at 449 nm, which shows the disappearance of oxidized flavin (Fig. 4A). Simultaneously, formation of a broad absorption band between 500 and 600 nm with maxima at 540 and 580 nm was observed. This absorption is indicative for a blue neutral flavoprotein radical (36Massey V. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3181-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Two isosbestic points at 354 and 494 nm were obtained, implying the presence of two species in the sample, i.e. the flavoprotein in its oxidized and radical state. The isosbestic point at 354 nm was lost after illumination for more than 1 min, indicating partial formation of the fully reduced state of CPH1-PHR. Even under anaerobic conditions, prolonged illumination (>1 min) was necessary to initiate the production of the fully reduced state (data not shown). It has been reported that AtCRY1 binds ATP (21Bouly J.P. Giovani B. Djamei A. Mueller M. Zeugner A. Dudkin E.A. Batschauer A. Ahmad M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) to the PHR domain (15Brautigam C.A. Smith B.S. Ma Z. Palnitkar M. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12142-12147Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Addition of ATP to CPH1-PHR led to a strong enhancement in light-induced radical formation (Fig. 4B). Isosbestic points did not change even after 300 s of illumination. The presence of AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, resulted in a light response identical to that with ATP (Fig. 4C). This result shows that the effect is due to ATP binding to the protein and not related to protein phosphorylation. The enhancement in radical formation is specific for ATP, because it was not inducible by addition of GTP (data not shown). The decay of the CPH1-PHR radical in the dark was investigated in a separate series of experiments. The sample was illuminated for 10 s with 457 nm blue light, and the recovery of the oxidized state was monitored through the absorption at 450 nm (Fig. 5A). The kinetic measurements were performed aerobically in the presence of the exogenous electron donor 2-mercaptoethanol. Initially, time traces were not fully reproducible and the sample did not fully recover back to the oxidized state. These problems were attributed to a deprivation of oxygen in the sample during illumination. Treatment with oxygen prior to illumination led to recovery kinetics of the oxidized state, which follow a monoexponential shape with a time constant of ∼200 s. The UV-visible spectrum obtained after recovery was identical to the one recorded before illumination (Fig. 5A, inset), implying that the light-induced reaction was fully reversible. Addition of ATP to the sample strongly impeded the radical decay (Fig. 5B). Only a slight recovery of the 450 nm absorption of the oxidized flavin was observed within the experimental time window of 30 min, which is illustrated by comparison with a theoretical curve with a time constant of 200 s (Fig. 5B, dashed line). Similarly, the decay kinetics was strongly slowed down under anaerobic conditions and was not interpretable by a simple kinetic scheme (data not shown). These findings indicate that ATP and oxygen concentration are major determinants of the decay kinetics of the CPH1-PHR radical.

https://openalex.org/W2050784279,"Although p38 MAPK is known to be activated in response to various environmental stresses and to have inhibitory roles in cell proliferation and tumor progression, its role in cell cycle progression in the absence of stress is unknown in most cell types. In the case of G2/M cell cycle control, p38 activation has been shown to trigger a rapid G2/M cell cycle checkpoint after DNA damage stress and a spindle checkpoint after microtubule disruption. In the course of our studies, we observed that p38 became actively phosphorylated, and its kinase activity increased transiently during G2/M cell cycle transition. Using an immunocytochemistry approach, the active form of p38 was found at the centrosome from late G2 throughout mitosis, which suggests functional relevance for active p38 protein during mitotic entry. A closer examination reveals that p38 inhibition by pharmacologic inhibitors significantly accelerated the timing of mitotic entry. In addition, long term exposure of the inhibitor enhanced Cdc2 activity. These results indicate that p38 activity during G2/M may be involved in a mechanism for fine tuning the initiation of mitosis and perhaps transit of mitosis. Consistent with our previous findings, Cdc25B was phosphorylated on serine 309 at the centrosome during G2/M when p38 was active at this site; Cdc25B phosphorylation inhibits Cdc25B activity, and this phosphorylation was found to be p38-dependent. Taken together, our findings suggest that p38 regulates the timing of mitotic entry via modulation of Cdc25B activity under normal nonstress conditions. Although p38 MAPK is known to be activated in response to various environmental stresses and to have inhibitory roles in cell proliferation and tumor progression, its role in cell cycle progression in the absence of stress is unknown in most cell types.

Taken together, our findings suggest that p38 regulates the timing of mitotic entry via modulation of Cdc25B activity under normal nonstress conditions. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 2The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ES, embryonic stem; NPM, nucleophosmin; MAPKAP, MAPK-activating protein kinase. is one of the three major members of MAPK proteins that control diverse intracellular events (1Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p38 is strongly phosphosphorylated and activated in response to proinflammatory cytokines and environmental stresses, such as UV radiation, heat shock, and osmotic shock, and has also been shown to play a major role in inflammation-signaling pathways and immune regulation. Conventionally, after most stimuli, p38 activation is mediated by the upstream kinases MKK3/6 through dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine located within the activating loop (2Wysk M. Yang D.D. Lu H.T. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3763-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, two different MKK-independent mechanisms have also been reported for p38 activation either through TAB1 binding or through T cell-specific ZAP-70 phosphorylation (3Ge B. Gram H. Di P.F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 4Salvador J.M. Mittelstadt P.R. Guszczynski T. Copeland T.D. Yamaguchi H. Appella E. Fornace Jr, A.J. Ashwell J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Due to the intrinsic role of p38 in stress signaling, an antiproliferative effect for p38 might be expected and has been demonstrated in a number of reports. For example, in G1 to S cell cycle transition, stress-mediated p38 signaling negatively regulates cyclin D1 transcription and phosphorylates cyclin D1, facilitating its degradation, which in turn contributes to G1/S arrest (5Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 6Casanovas O. Miro F. Estanyol J.M. Itarte E. Agell N. Bachs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35091-35097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the G2 to M phase transition, activated p38 after UV irradiation is required for a G2/M checkpoint involving Cdc25B and Cdc25C, which play pivotal roles in controlling Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex activity during mitosis (7Bulavin D.V. Higashimoto Y. Popoff I.J. Gaarde W.A. Basrur V. Potapova O. Appella E. Fornace A.J.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Active p38 directly phosphorylates serine 216 on Cdc25C and serines 309 and 361 on Cdc25B after UV radiation, in turn promoting 14-3-3 binding to Cdc25B and Cdc25C (7Bulavin D.V. Higashimoto Y. Popoff I.J. Gaarde W.A. Basrur V. Potapova O. Appella E. Fornace A.J.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In addition, Manke et al. (8Manke I.A. Nguyen A. Lim D. Stewart M.Q. Elia A.E. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) demonstrated that MAPKAP kinase 2 (MAPK-activating protein kinase 2), a direct downstream target of p38, can directly phosphorylate Cdc25B and Cdc25C. Similarly, Srk1 (StyI-related kinase), a downstream kinase of yeast p38 MAPK, has been shown to control mitotic entry by directly phosphorylating and inhibiting Cdc25 during osmotic stress (9Lopez-Aviles S. Grande M. Gonzalez M. Helgesen A.L. Alemany V. Sanchez-Piris M. Bachs O. Millar J.B. Aligue R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 49-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Taken together, there is strong evidence that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway can play a critical role(s) in controlling mitotic entry through Cdc25 inhibitory phosphorylation in response to a variety of stresses. Checkpoint proteins often have tumor suppressor properties and results from a variety of laboratories have demonstrated this for p38 (10Bulavin D.V. Fornace Jr, A.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2004; 92: 95-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Recently, Engel et al. have reported that p38 inhibition, either by pharmacological inhibitors or by a genetic approach via disruption of the p38α gene, up-regulated critical mitosis related genes and enhanced proliferation in cultured cardiomyocytes on the basis of an increased fraction of mitotic cells (11Engel F.B. Schebesta M. Duong M.T. Lu G. Ren S. Madwed J.B. Jiang H. Wang Y. Keating M.T. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar); this suggests that endogenous p38 activity even in the absence of stress can regulate cardiomyocyte proliferation and mitosis. Herein, we have found that under normal cell culture condition, p38 activity was slightly increased during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and active p38 was localized at centrosomes, where its upstream kinase MKK3/6 was found to be active at the same time. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that centrosomal Cdc25B was phosphorylated on serine 309 by p38 during mitosis. Inhibition of p38 activity by pharmacological inhibition increased the mitotic population significantly at this time, suggesting that p38 activity during mitosis controls the timing of mitotic initiation through inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc25B. Reagents—The phospho-p38 antibody (Thr180/Tyr182; catalog number 9211), p38 antibody (catalog number 9218), phospho-MKK1/2 antibody (catalog number 9121), phospho-MKK3/6 antibody (catalog number 9231), phosphohistone H3 (catalog number 9706), and phospho-ATF-2 antibody (catalog number 9221) used in these studies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Blocking peptide for phospho-p38 antibody (catalog number 1170) was from Cell Signaling Technology. The Cdc25B antibody (catalog number 610527) was from BD Transduction Laboratories. The γ-tubulin antibody (T-6557) used for centrosome detection was from Sigma. The other antibodies, such as cyclin B1 (GNS1), PLK (H-152), α-tubulin (B-7), Cdc2 (17Kramer A. Mailand N. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Wilkinson C.J. Nigg E.A. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), p38 (C-20), and nucleophosmin (NPM) (H-106) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. SB203580 (catalog number 513030) and PD169316 (catalog number 513030) to inhibit p38 kinase activity were purchased from Calbiochem. Phospho-Cdc25B (serine 309-specific) antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Ettore Appella (NCI, National Institutes of Health). Cell Culture—HeLa, HCT116, RKO, or mouse embryonic fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). In some experiments, cell synchronization was performed using double thymidine block as previously described (12Cha H. Dangi S. Machamer C.E. Shapiro P. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Synchronized cells were released back into the cell cycle by removal of thymidine. Wild type and p38α-/- mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were maintained as described previously (13Jirmanova L. Bulavin D.V. Fornace A.J.J. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1428-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (catalog number 41966-052; Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (HyClone), 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (catalog number 31350-010; Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (catalog number 15140-122; Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine (catalog number 25030-024; Invitrogen), 100 μm nonessential amino acids (catalog number 11140-035; Invitrogen), and 1000 units/ml LIF (catalog number ESG1107; Chemicon). Cytosol, Membrane, and Nuclear Protein Preparations—Cells were collected by scraping with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and spun down at 1,000 rpm for 1 min to remove the PBS. The pellet was resuspended with extraction buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by incubation on ice for 15 min. Passing cells through a 26-gauge needle 10 times was performed to disrupt cellular membranes for isolation of nuclei. The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 min to separate the nuclei from the cytosolic and membrane proteins in the cytoplasmic supernatant. Nuclear proteins in the nuclei pellet were extracted by frequent vortexing in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The nuclei-free cytoplasmic supernatant and the nuclear protein fraction were further centrifuged for 1.5 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions were saved as the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic proteins. The pellets containing the cytoplasmic and nuclear membrane proteins were reextracted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoblotting—For harvesting, cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed with 300 μl of tissue lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture), and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm to clarify lysates. Approximately 20 μg of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked for 1-2 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-T (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20), and incubated with various primary antibodies in PBS-T containing 1% bovine serum albumin solution for 1-16 h. Membranes were washed several times in PBS-T solution and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (0.1 μg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on round glass coverslips (number 1; VWR) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 8 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min. Fixed cells were incubated for an additional 1-2 h in PBS-T containing 3% bovine serum albumin for blocking, followed by a 1-h incubation with various antibodies described above. Cells were washed several times with PBS-T solution and incubated with Cy™3 anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or Alexa 488 Fluor-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) and counterstained for cellular DNA with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 0.2 μg/ml in PBS). For infrared imaging, infrared fluorescence conjugated mouse and rabbit antibodies were from Invitrogen (catalog number A21058) and Rockland (catalog number 611-132-122), respectively. Staining for infrared imaging was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (LI-COR Biosciences). Signal intensity of each slide was determined and analyzed by the Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). In Vitro Kinase Assay—Cdc2 was isolated from G1/S synchronized or mitotic arrested cells lysates by immunoprecipitation. In vitro kinase assays were performed in a reaction buffer of 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm unlabeled ATP, and 10 μCi/μl[γ-32P]ATP in the presence of isolated kinase from G1/S or G2/M lysates, including histone H1 (Upstate Biotechnology) as substrate. Phosphate incorporation into substrates was determined by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Mitotic Index Assay—HCT116 cells grown on coverslips were synchronized at the G1/S-phase boundary as described above and released in the presence or absence of SB203580. At varying times after release, coverslips were fixed, and cellular DNA was stained with phosphohistone H3 antibody and DAPI. Mitotic cells identified by positive phosphohistone H3 staining were counted and expressed as a fraction of the total cells counted to determine the mitotic index (7Bulavin D.V. Higashimoto Y. Popoff I.J. Gaarde W.A. Basrur V. Potapova O. Appella E. Fornace A.J.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Within each experiment, 300-350 cells were counted for each condition and time point. Active p38 during G2/M—G1/S-synchronized HeLa or RKO cells by double thymidine block were generally in G2 at 5 h and in mitosis at 7 h after release (supplemental Fig. S1A). As shown in Fig. 1A, relatively distinct immunoreactivity toward phospho-p38 antibody was observed from 5 h and was increased at 7 h when cells are in the G2 and G2/M phase of cell cycle, respectively. This indicates that p38 MAPK becomes active during the G2/M phase of cell cycle in HeLa cells. Immunoblotting for cyclin B1, which is a widely used mitotic marker protein, was performed to confirm the G2/M cell cycle phase. To determine if p38 MAPK during G2/M contains enzymatic activity, in vitro kinase assays were carried out using ATF-2 fusion protein as a substrate. p38 MAPK isolated from G2/M-synchronized HeLa cells exhibited higher activity toward ATF-2 protein than p38 from G1/S synchronized cells on the basis of a modest but significant increase of the phospho-ATF-2 signal (Fig. 1B, top). Based on the pixel intensity of phospho-ATF-2 determined by NIH Image software, the activity during G2/M appeared to show a 5-6-fold increase compared with that of G1/S (Fig. 1B, bottom). Detection of Phospho-p38 at the Centrosomes during Mitosis—Previously, active p38 has been found in the nonstressed developing retina, and positive cells appeared to be in mitosis by immunohistochemistry (14Campos C.B. Bedard P.A. Linden R. Neuroscience. 2002; 112: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In order to determine the localization for active p38, immunocytochemistry using a phosphospecific antibody for activated p38 was performed in growing HeLa cells. Interestingly, a distinct immunoreactivity was found, shown as two dotlike foci that appear to be centrosomes from late G2 and throughout mitosis, from prophase to telophase (data not shown and Fig. 2). The same results were obtained in growing RKO cells (data not shown) as well as wild type ES but not p38α-/- ES cells (supplemental Fig. S2). To confirm that these signals come from the centrosome, γ-tubulin was co-immunostained along with a phospho-p38 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A, phospho-p38 immunoreactivity perfectly matched with the signal for γ-tubulin, indicating that phosphorylated p38 MAPK is located at the centrosome during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Preincubation with a blocking peptide completely eliminated centrosomal immunoreactivity from mitotic cells, which excludes the possibility of nonspecific signal involvement (Fig. 3B). As noted above, the absence of this signal in p38-deficient cells also demonstrates that this is bona fide p38 staining at the centrosome. As shown in Fig. 3C, Western blotting with phospho-p38 antibody did not display any additional signal from the G2/M sample except in one band, which corresponded to the phospho-p38 signal from the positive control (anisomycin). Ultracentrifugation from the cytoplasmic fraction can precipitate most of the subcellular organelles, such as the Golgi apparatus (15Cha H. Shapiro P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and centrosomes (16Cha H. Hancock C. Dangi S. Maiguel D. Carrier F. Shapiro P. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, in agreement with cell immunostaining data, the increased level of phospho-p38 in the cytoplasmic membrane fraction obtained from G2/M synchronized cells is also demonstrated by this approach, and this is consistent with localization of active p38 at the centrosome during G2/M (Fig. 3D). A strong nuclear accumulation of cyclin B1 shown in the G2/M sample verified the fractionation method as well as G2/M synchrony (Fig. 3D, bottom). Immunostaining after a cold methanol fixation also showed the same result (supplemental Fig. S3A). In addition, we also observed the same centrosomal phospho-p38 signal in primary cells, such as early passage mouse embryo fibroblasts and immortalized normal fibroblasts, such as WI-38-hTERT- and BJ-hTERT-transformed cells (supplemental Fig. S3B) (data not shown).FIGURE 3Localization of phosphorylated p38 at the centrosomes during mitosis. A, HeLa cells were immunostained with phospho-p38 antibody (top left) and γ-tubulin (top right) as a centrosome marker. The arrows indicate centrosomal signal for phospho-p38. Phospho-p38 and DAPI image were overlapped and shown at the bottom (Merged). B, phospho-p38 antibody was preincubated with its specific blocking peptide (lower two panels) for 30 min prior to immunostaining. C, HeLa cells were incubated with 100 nm anisomycin for 30 min prior to harvest. G1/S and G2/M phase-synchronized cells were obtained by double-thymidine block and 9 h post G1/S release, respectively. Cyclin B1 immunoblot was used to determine the mitotic population (middle). Immunoblot for p38 served as loading control (bottom). D, cells synchronized at G1/S or G2/M phase were separated into cytoplasmic or nuclear protein fraction. The cytoplasmic fraction was further separated into soluble (C) or insoluble (M) proteins by ultracentrifugation. The protein fractions were immunoblotted with phospho-p38 (top), total p38 (middle) and cyclin B1 (bottom) antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, these data lead us to conclude that p38 MAPK activity is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner and that activated p38 is localized to the centrosome during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. These observations suggest a novel functional role for p38 that is not related to the stress response during mitosis. Coincidence of Spatial and Temporal Activation of Upstream Kinase, MKK3/6, with p38 MAPK during G2/M—Because in most cases p38 activation is mediated by MKK3/6, the activation of MKK3/6 should coincide with p38 activation temporally and spatially unless active p38 is translocated to the centrosome after cytoplasmic activation. To examine this process, MKK3/6 activation was monitored by immunoblotting and immunostaining using a phospho-specific antibody for MKK3/6. As shown in Fig. 4A, immunoblotting for phospho-MKK3/6 demonstrated an increased level of phospho-MKK3/6 in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle when p38 MAPK has also been shown to be active. Unless p38 activation by MKK3/6 occurs in the cytoplasm and translocates to the centrosome during G2/M, activation of MKK3/6 could also be occurring at the centrosome at these times. In agreement with the latter scenario, we found distinct phospho-MKK3/6 immunoreactivity at the centrosome where the mitotic spindle stained by α-tubulin antibody was nucleated (Fig. 4B). As with previous p38 immunoblots (Fig. 3C), immunoblotting results for phospho-MKK3/6 did not show any additional nonspecific band in the G2/M sample, indicating that the centrosomal signal of phospho-MKK3/6 antibody is specific for phospho-MKK3/6 proteins (Fig. 4B). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the MKK3/6 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways become active in a cell cycle-dependent manner under nonstress conditions. SB203580 Treatment Accelerates Mitotic Initiation—Since many phosphoproteins found at the centrosome during G2/M, such as Chk1 (17Kramer A. Mailand N. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Wilkinson C.J. Nigg E.A. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), Aurora A (18Hirota T. Kunitoku N. Sasayama T. Marumoto T. Zhang D. Nitta M. Hatakeyama K. Saya H. Cell. 2003; 114: 585-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), and Plk1 (19Lane H.A. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), have been shown to play important roles in regulating mitosis initiation or progression, either positively or negatively, and since it has been suggested that centrosomes facilitate mitotic entry by condensing critical mitotic regulatory factors, such as cyclin B1, Cdc2, and Plk1 (17Kramer A. Mailand N. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Wilkinson C.J. Nigg E.A. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that phosphorylated p38 at the centrosome may have a role(s) in regulating mitotic entry. To address this question, we examined cell cycle progression from G1/S-synchronized HCT116 cells. Taking advantage of phosphohistone H3 antibody (phosphoserine 10) staining, mitotic cells were identified at the given time after G1/S release either in the absence or presence of p38 inhibitor. As expected, at 9 h post-G1/S, when most of the cells have progressed to mitosis, more phosphohistone H3-positive cells were found in the presence of the p38 inhibitor than in the control group (Fig. 5A). The increased mitotic population by p38 inhibitor was confirmed by infrared fluorescence scanning that enabled us to quantify the signal intensity. In experiments similar to Fig. 5A, mitotic cells were identified and then determined by phosphohistone H3 antibody. The antibody against Ki-67, proliferating antigen, was used for normalizing signal from the total number of cells. Consistently, the mitotic population was significantly increased at 8 h post-G1/S by p38 inhibitor compared with control (Fig. 5, B and C). There was an approximately 2-fold increase of pH3/Ki-67 signal in SB203580-treated cells at 8 h over control. Next, to exclude possible side effects of the p38 inhibitor itself in cell cycle and cell proliferation, we made use of p38α-/- ES cells to compare cell growth to wild type ES cells. As shown in Fig. 5D, p38α-/- ES cells grew significantly faster than wild type ES cells. Taken together, these data indicate that p38α plays an important role in negatively controlling mitotic initiation and consequently modulating cellular proliferation, even in the absence of exogenous stress. p53 and p38 MAPK during Mitosis—Regarding downstream effectors of p38, p53 is a strong candidate for the following reasons. First, p53 has been reported to be a target of p38 after UV radiation stress at various sites (20Huang C. Ma W.Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12229-12235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 21Bulavin D.V. Saito S. Hollander M.C. Sakaguchi K. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Fornace Jr., A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6845-6854Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Second, p53 has been shown to locate to the centrosome during G2/M in an ATM-dependent manner (22Tritarelli A. Oricchio E. Ciciarello M. Mangiacasale R. Palena A. Lavia P. Soddu S. Cundari E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3751-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). And third, p53 plays a pivotal role in G2 arrest after DNA damage (23Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that p38 may control the timing of mitotic initiation through p53 at the centrosome. Thus, we compared the mitotic index in the presence or absence of SB203580 between HCT116 wild type and HCT116 p53-/- cells. Interestingly, SB203580 increased the mitotic population in both HCT116 wild type and HCT116 p53-/- cells to a similar degree (supplemental Fig. S4, yellow triangles), whereas UV irradiation (10 Jm-2) expectedly failed to arrest cells at G2 in HCT116 p53-/- cells, (supplemental Fig. S4, red squares). The UV-induced mitotic delay was prevented by SB203580 pretreatment, which is consistent with our previous report that p38 has one or more roles in G2/M arrest after DNA damage induced by UV irradiation (7Bulavin D.V. Higashimoto Y. Popoff I.J. Gaarde W.A. Basrur V. Potapova O. Appella E. Fornace A.J.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). These data indicate that p38 regulates mitotic entry in a p53-independent manner in the absence of stress. Cdc25B and p38 MAPK during Mitosis—As a next candidate, we investigated Cdc25B for the following reasons. First, Cdc25B is reportedly phosphorylated and thus inhibited by active p38 after UV irradiation with resultant G2/M checkpoint activation (7Bulavin D.V. Higashimoto Y. Popoff I.J. Gaarde W.A. Basrur V. Potapova O. Appella E. Fornace A.J.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Second, centrosomal Cdc25B has been shown to contribute to mitotic initiation in cooperation with Cdc25A (24Mirey G. Chartrain I. Froment C. Quaranta M. Bouche J.P. Monsarrat B. Tassan J.P. Ducommun B. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Dutertre S. Cazales M. Quaranta M. Froment C. Trabut V. Dozier C. Mirey G. Bouche J.P. Theis-Febvre N. Schmitt E. Monsarrat B. Prigent C. Ducommun B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2523-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Interestingly, by immunostaining, Cdc25B was found to co-localize with phospho-p38 at the centrosome during mitosis (Fig. 6A). Therefore, we hypothesized that centrosomal Cdc25B at G2/M might be regulated by transiently increased p38 MAPK activity at the same time and might control the timing of mitotic initiation. We next examined whether the phosphorylated form of Cdc25B, which has been reported to be phosphorylated on serine 309 by p38, is found at the centrosome (7Bulavin D.V. Higashimoto Y. Popoff I.J. Gaarde W.A. Basrur V. Potapova O. Appella E. Fornace A.J.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6B, the inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc25B occurred at the centrosome when the chromosomes started to condense, indicating early prophase (designated P in Fig. 6B); this correlated with the presence of phospho-p38 at the centrosome as compared with an interphase cell (I). Cdc25B Phosphorylation Is Regulated in a p38 Activity-dependent Manner—Next we tested whether the p38 inhibitor, SB203580, can reduce this inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc25B. G1/S-synchronized HeLa cells were released, and 5 h later when cells had progressed to G2, SB203580 was added, and cells were collected at various times. SB203580-treated cells showed significantly reduced phospho-Cdc25B signal at the centrosome even in la"

Previously, we described the inactivation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) by direct oxidation of a reactive cysteine in the activation loop of the kinase. In the present study, we demonstrate that in HeLa cells PKA activity follows a biphasic response to thiol oxidation. Under mild oxidizing conditions, or short exposure to oxidants, forskolin-stimulated PKA activity is enhanced. This enhancement was blocked by sulfhydryl reducing agents, demonstrating a reversible mode of activation. In contrast, forskolin-stimulated PKA activity is inhibited by more severe oxidizing conditions. Mild oxidation enhanced PKA activity stimulated by forskolin, isoproterenol, or the cell-permeable analog, 8-bromo-cAMP. When cells were lysed in the presence of serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, NaF, the PKA-enhancing effect of oxidation was blunted. These results suggest oxidation of a PKA-counteracting phosphatase may be inhibited, thus enhancing the apparent kinase activity. Using an in vivo PKA activity reporter, we demonstrated that mild oxidation does indeed prolong the PKA signal induced by isoproterenol by inhibiting counteracting phosphatase activity. The results of this study demonstrate in live cells a unique synergistic mechanism whereby the PKA signaling pathway is enhanced in an apparent biphasic manner.

Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2381-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Regulation of the kinase is primarily achieved by the production and degradation of the second messenger cAMP in response to extracellular stimuli, including hormones and neurotransmitters (2Sutherland E.W. Science. 1972; 177: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Binding of these ligands to Gs-coupled receptors initiates the activation of adenylate cyclase and production of cAMP from ATP. PKA normally exists as an inactive heterotetramer composed of two regulatory subunits and two catalytic subunits (3Johnson D.A. Akamine P. Radzio-Andzelm E. Madhusudan M. Taylor S.S. Chem.

The PKA signal persists until cAMP is hydrolyzed by phosphodiesterases (2Sutherland E.W.

Oxidants can potentially regulate the PKA pathway at multiple points, including the production and degradation of cAMP, and the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of substrates. At the level of cAMP production, biochemical evidence has demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide has a biphasic effect upon adenylate cyclase activity in rat heart membranes, with activity increasing upon brief exposure to oxidants, whereas inhibition is observed upon longer exposure (19Persad S. Elimban V. Kaila J. Dhalla N.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1623-1631PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, perfusion of isolated rat hearts with a high concentration of H2O2 was found to block the stimulation of cAMP by forskolin, a potent activator of adenylate cyclase (18Persad S. Panagia V. Dhalla N.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 186: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment of cells in culture with hydrogen peroxide enhances forskolin-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase activity via a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent mechanism (20Tan C.M.

Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Oxidation can also regulate the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of protein substrates. Previously, we demonstrated that site-specific oxidation of the catalytic subunit of PKA occurs via oxidation of Cys199 in the kinase activation loop (16Humphries K.M. Juliano C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43505-43511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Oxidation of this site via the formation of a protein-glutathione mixed disulfide inhibited kinase activity and primed a critical phosphorylation site in the activation loop, pThr197, for dephosphorylation (17Humphries K.M. Deal M.S. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2750-2758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Deglutathionylation and reactivation of the kinase is achieved by treatment with reducing agents or the protein-glutathione reducing enzyme glutaredoxin (24Shelton M.D. Chock P.B. Mieyal J.J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In contrast, reactive oxygen species could potentially enhance the persistence of the PKA cascade via inhibition of phosphatases. Treatment of cells in culture enhances threonine phosphorylation via glutathionylation and inhibition of PP2A (25Rao R.K. Clayton L.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Calcineurin has also been reported to be sensitive to H2O2-mediated inactivation in a thiol-oxidation-dependent manner (26Sommer D. Coleman S. Swanson S.A. Stemmer P.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Li S. Wang X. Klee C.B. Krieger C. Mol. Brain Res. 2004; 125: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The relative sensitivity of PKA and phosphatases to inhibition by thiol oxidation and reactivation by reduction suggests potentially critical points of redox regulation.In the present study, we demonstrate the balance between kinase and phosphatase oxidation in regulating the PKA phosphorylation signal. Incubating HeLa cells with increasing concentrations of the cell-permeable, sulfhydryl-specific oxidant, diamide, induced an apparent biphasic effect upon phosphorylation of PKA substrate. Brief or a low concentration of diamide enhanced phosphorylation induced by the PKA agonists forskolin, isoproterenol, or 8-Br-cAMP. In contrast, longer or higher concentrations of diamide inhibited PKA phosphorylation induced by these same agonists. In vivo monitoring of PKA activity using a genetically encoded FRET reporter confirmed that mild oxidation enhances the duration of substrate phosphorylation via inhibition of phosphatase activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted.PKA Oxidation Studies—HeLa cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (CellGro) containing penicillin and streptomycin. Prior to treatment, cells (∼75% confluent) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then placed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of forskolin, isoproterenol, or 8-Br-cAMP, and then incubated for 10 min at 23 °C. Indicated concentrations of diamide were then added to the cells for 30 min, or stated otherwise, and then allowed to incubate for indicated times at 23 °C. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and collected in 1.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by spinning 5 min at 500 × g. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and spun again. Pellets were then lysed by resuspending the pellet in 200 μl of a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, and 1.0% Nonidet P-40 (Buffer B) with DTT, NaF, or the indicated amounts of okadaic acid (EMD Biosciences) or FK506 (Sigma). After incubating on ice for 10 min, the lysate was spun for 5 min at 9300 × g, and the soluble fraction was collected. Western blot analysis indicated nearly complete solubilization of PKA under these conditions. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined using Coomassie Blue Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard.PKA Activity—PKA activity is determined using a non-radioactive PKA assay system (16Humphries K.M. Juliano C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43505-43511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 28MacAla L.J. Hayslett J.P. Smallwood J.I. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 1746-1750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) utilizing fluorescently labeled Kemptide (Caliper), the prototypical PKA substrate. In the absence of phosphorylation the substrate has no net charge. Upon phosphorylation, the peptide substrate has a net negative charge. For this assay, 7.0 μg of cell lysate was added to a reaction mixture containing 1.0 mm ATP, 5.0 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm Tris, pH 7.2, in the presence or absence 5.0 μm cAMP for 10-30 min, and then stopped by the addition of the PKA-specific inhibitor PKI (50 μm final). Negatively charged, phosphorylated peptide is then separated from neutral, uncharged peptide by agarose (0.8%) gel electrophoresis run at 100 V for 25 min followed by UV imaging analysis. All kinase activities are determined to be both cAMP-dependent and PKI-sensitive as well as linear within the time frame of the reaction.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired Student's t test, with p < 0.05 differences considered significant. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. of means.Constructs—The cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity reporter (AKAR2.2) was a generous gift of Dr. Jin Zhang (Johns Hopkins University) and has been previously described (29Zhang J. Hupfeld C.J. Taylor S.S. Olefsky J.M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 2005; 437: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Briefly, this construct contains a YFP (YFP), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), a PKA-specific phosphorylation site, and a forkhead-associated domain. Phosphorylation of the substrate site induces binding to the forkhead-associated domain and causes a subsequent increase in FRET intensity.Imaging—Cells were imaged in the dark at room temperature, with forskolin or diamide added as indicated. Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.) using a MicroMax digital camera (Roper-Princeton Instruments) controlled by MetaFluor 3.0 software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Data were collected through a 10% neutral density filter. Yellow fluorescent protein images were acquired through a 495/10 nm excitation filter, a 505 nm dichroic mirror, and a 568/55 nm emission filter. CFP images were obtained through a 420/10 nm excitation filter, a 450 nm dichroic mirror, and a 475/40 nm emission filter. FRET images were obtained through the same excitation filter, and dichroic mirror as CFP images, but the emission filter was 535/25 nm. The integration time was 100 ms.RESULTSPKA Phosphorylation Follows a Biphasic Response to Increasing Oxidation—As previously described, PKA is inhibited by oxidation via either glutathionylation of Cys199 in the activation loop, or the formation of an internal disulfide bond between Cys199 and Cys343 (16Humphries K.M. Juliano C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43505-43511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, in HeLa cells treated with a low concentration of adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin (10 μm), and increasing concentrations of the sulfhydryl specific oxidant, diamide, there is a biphasic response in apparent PKA activity. As shown in Fig. 1A, following treatment of cells with concentrations of diamide up to 100 μm, PKA activity in cell lysates was enhanced in a linear manner. Kinase activity nearly doubled following treatment of cells with 100 μm diamide (control activity of 595 ± 43.6 versus 1022 ± 103.6 pmol × min-1 × mg-1 following 100 μm diamide treatment). In contrast, and consistent with previous results (16Humphries K.M. Juliano C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43505-43511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), concentrations of diamide above 100 μm inhibited PKA activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Incubation of cells with 2.0 mm diamide maximally reduced PKA activity to 326 ± 74.1 pmol × min-1 × mg-1.Diamide is a strong sulfhydryl-specific oxidant that preferentially oxidizes small thiol-containing molecules and promotes protein glutathionylation (30Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In addition, diamide can catalyze the formation of intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds via oxidation of protein cysteines. As shown in Fig. 1B, inclusion of DTT (25 mm) to cell lysates reversed the enhanced PKA phosphorylation induced by 100 μm diamide. This result demonstrates that the activity-enhancing effect that diamide had on PKA phosphorylation is dependent upon the oxidation state of sulfhydryls. In contrast, DTT was unable to recover the inhibition of PKA at 2.0 mm diamide.To characterize the mechanism whereby oxidation enhances PKA activity, we next examined the ability of diamide to enhance phosphorylation under cAMP-saturating conditions. It was hypothesized that, if a low concentration of diamide enhances adenylate cyclase activity, the effect it has on PKA substrate phosphorylation would be blocked under conditions of high cellular cAMP in which the total pool of PKA was activated. Using a high concentration of forskolin (50 μm) and including a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX (100 μm), induced a 6-fold increase in PKA activity as compared with 10 μm forskolin alone (Fig. 1C). PKA activity with 50 μm forskolin and 100 μm IBMX was 2948.9 ± 148 versus 595 ± 43.6 pmol × min-1 × mg-1 for cells treated with 10 μm forskolin. This increase in activity was not further enhanced by including cAMP (5.0 mm) to reactions, indicating the entire pool of kinase was activated under these conditions (data not shown). Nevertheless, incubation of cells with 100 μm diamide increased PKA activity under these experimental conditions but was less dramatic than seen with low (10 μm) forskolin concentrations (Fig. 1C). As shown, 100 μm diamide increased activity by 31% in high forskolin/IBMX-treated cells as compared with a 72% increase in activity with low forskolin treatment. The biphasic effect of increasing diamide concentrations was also seen under maximal PKA stimulation, with 2.0 mm diamide decreasing forskolin/IBMX-induced PKA activity by 66%. Inclusion of DTT in the cell lysates was able to partially lower kinase activity enhanced by 100 μm diamide and largely recovered activity induced by 2.0 mm diamide (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that oxidation is not enhancing PKA activity through increased adenylate cyclase activity and that the effect diamide is having on phosphorylation of the peptide substrate is thiol-oxidation-dependent.To further characterize the effect of oxidation on PKA substrate phosphorylation, we next looked at the effect of 1.0 mm diamide, a concentration that inhibited PKA activity at 30 min (Fig. 1A), with increasing time. As shown in Fig. 2, incubation of cells with 10 μm forskolin and 1.0 mm diamide resulted in an immediate enhancement of PKA activity with decreasing activity over time. Diamide added just prior to cell lysis had a PKA activity of 1137 ± 235 pmol × min-1 × mg-1 as compared with 595 ± 43 pmol × min-1 × mg-1 for those that were treated with forskolin alone. Activity peaked after 10 min, increasing to 2537 ± 407 pmol × min-1 × mg-1, and then decreasing over the next 20 min to below that of the zero time. The effect of diamide on PKA activity was dependent upon the oxidation state of sulfhydryls. Addition of DTT (25 mm) to the cell lysates largely reversed the enhanced PKA activity seen by short durations of exposure to diamide.FIGURE 2Forskolin-stimulated PKA activity follows a biphasic response to duration of exposure to diamide. HeLa cells were incubated with 10 μm forskolin for 10 min at 23 °C prior to the addition of 1.0 mm diamide. Cells were incubated with diamide for the indicated times, collected, and lysed in either the presence (close circles) or absence (open circles) of 25 mm DTT, protein concentrations were standardized, and PKA activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are means ± S.E. (n = 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Diamide Enhances Receptor-mediated and Direct Activation of PKA—Physiological activation of PKA normally proceeds through a pathway whereby an extracellular ligand binds a G protein-coupled receptor. Activation of a Gs type G protein is followed by downstream activation of adenylate cyclase and production of cAMP. The amount of cAMP available for PKA activation is in turn regulated by phosphodiesterases. The phosphorylation of substrates is reversed by serine/threonine protein phosphatases. Thus, there are several regulatory points at which the observed PKA activity can be redox-regulated. The results in Fig. 1B suggested that the observed enhanced PKA activity was not a result of increased adenylate cyclase activity. We therefore next looked at the ability of thiol oxidation to enhance PKA activity with either isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic agonist, or 8-Br-cAMP, a cell-permeable cAMP analog.As shown in Table 1, HeLa cells treated with isoproterenol (5 μm) and IBMX (100 μm) had a PKA activity of 695 ± 62 pmol × min-1 × mg-1 as compared with 119 ± 18 nmol × min-1 × mg-1 for untreated cells or cells that were incubated with only isoproterenol (data not shown). Treatment of cells with diamide alone (100 μm for 30 min) had minimal effect on PKA activity (218 ± 80 pmol × min-1 × mg-1) indicating diamide is not enhancing PKA activity by direct activation of the kinase or adenylate cyclase. However, this concentration of diamide significantly enhanced the isoproterenol/IBMX-induced activation of PKA, doubling the activity to 1164 ± 96 nmol × min-1 × mg-1. Furthermore, this enhancement was reversed by addition of 25 mm DTT to the lysis buffer, reducing the activity to 815 ± 122 pmol × min-1 × mg-1, indicating that oxidized sulfhydryls contribute to the observed PKA activity. Because diamide enhanced PKA activity even in the presence of excess phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX, it was concluded that diamide is not enhancing PKA activity by inhibiting the breakdown of cAMP.TABLE 1Oxidation enhances PKA phosphorylation of a peptide substrate and is reversible by thiol reductionNo additionPKA agonistPKA agonist plus DTTPKA agonist plus diamidePKA agonist plus diamide plus DTTpmol × min−1 × mg−1Isoproterenol plus IBMX119.1 ± 18695.92 ± 62787 ± 931184 ± 96849 ± 1218-Br-cAMP102 ± 17798 ± 62813 ± 1021316 ± 86914 ± 144 Open table in a new tab We next looked at the ability of diamide to enhance the direct activation of PKA by the cell-permeable analog 8-Br-cAMP. As shown in Table 1, a low concentration of 8-Br-cAMP (10 μm) significantly enhanced PKA activity (807 ± 61 pmol × min-1 × mg-1) as compared with no treatment (102 ± 17 pmol × min-1 × mg-1). Treatment of cells with diamide (100 μm) and 10 μm 8-Br-cAMP significantly enhanced the activation of PKA to 1316 ± 86 pmol × min-1 × mg-1. Inclusion of DTT to the cell lysate reversed this enhancement but had no effect on control activity (Table 1). This result conclusively shows that oxidation is not enhancing PKA activity upstream of cAMP production.The Effect of Diamide and Phosphatase Inhibitors on PKA Activity Are Not Additive—Our results indicate that oxidation by low diamide concentrations enhances PKA activity and is reversible by sulfhydryl reduction. This enhancement occurs at the level of apparent PKA activity and is not a result of increased cAMP production or decreased cAMP breakdown. We thus hypothesized that, under our experimental conditions, oxidation may be acting to enhance the apparent PKA activity by inhibiting a competing phosphatase.As shown in Fig. 3, inclusion of a nonspecific phosphatase inhibitor, NaF, in cell lysis buffer had a minor effect on PKA activity in the absence of forskolin (basal activity of 132 ± 16 × min-1 × mg-1 versus 184 ± 4 pmol × min-1 × mg-1 with NaF). However, cell cultures treated with forskolin (10 μm) and then lysed in the presence of NaF showed a dramatic increase in the observed PKA activity (1373 ± 73 pmol × min-1 × mg-1), as compared with forskolin alone (621 ± 88 pmol × min-1 × mg-1). This result shows that, under conditions of limited cAMP production, the persistence of PKA substrate phosphorylation in cell lysates is dictated by phosphatase activity. Diamide (100 μm) enhanced forskolin-stimulated PKA activity (1074 ± 79 pmol × min-1 × mg-1) to a lesser extent than NaF treatment. Cells treated with forskolin and diamide and then lysed in buffer containing NaF had an activity of 1503 ± 60 min-1 × mg-1. This result demonstrates that diamide and NaF treatment both enhance PKA activity to a similar extent, and that their effects upon the observed PKA activity are non-additive. This suggests that oxidation is enhancing the apparent PKA activity by inactivating a phosphatase(s) that dephosphorylates PKA substrates.FIGURE 3Diamide and NaF enhance PKA activity in a non-additive manner. HeLa cells were incubated with 10 μm forskolin for 10 min at 23 °C prior to the addition of 100 μm diamide. Cells were incubated an additional 30 min at 23 °C, collected, lysed in either the presence or absence of 25 mm NaF, as indicated, protein concentrations were standardized, and PKA activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are means ± S.E.

This pharmacological chaperoning was thought to result from ligand-mediated stabilization of immature receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the present study, we directly tested this hypothesis using wild-type and mutant forms of the human δ-opioid receptor as models. ER-localized receptors were isolated by expressing the receptors in HEK293 cells under tightly controlled tetracycline induction and blocking their ER export with brefeldin A. The ER-retained δ-opioid receptor precursors were able to bind [3H]diprenorphine with high affinity, and treatment of cells with an opioid antagonist naltrexone led to a 2-fold increase in the number of binding sites. After removing the transport block, the antagonist-mediated increase in the number of receptors was detectable at the cell surface by flow cytometry and cell surface biotinylation assay. Importantly, opioid ligands, both antagonists and agonists, were found to stabilize the ER-retained receptor precursors in an in vitro heat inactivation assay and the treatment enhanced dissociation of receptor precursors from the molecular chaperone calnexin. Thus, we conclude that pharmacological chaperones facilitate plasma membrane targeting of δ-opioid receptors by binding and stabilizing receptor precursors, thereby promoting their release from the stringent ER quality control.

Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). Proteins that do not fulfill the criteria of the quality control are targeted for retrotranslocation and degradation in the cytosol by the ER-associated degradation pathway (2Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Since ER quality control relies on conformational rather than functional criteria, even minor changes in the primary structure of a protein can lead to intracellular retention, thus preventing the affected protein from reaching its correct location in the cell. Thus, even salvageable proteins that might be functionally active can be incorrectly directed for degradation. Such an etiology is the underlying cause for a growing number of congenital and acquired conformational diseases, including those that affect G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), cell surface seven-transmembrane domain proteins that mediate extracellular messages into intracellular responses. Examples include nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, retinitis pigmentosa, and familial obesity that are caused by mutant forms of the V2 vasopressin receptor, rhodopsin, and melanocortin receptor 4, respectively (3Schoöneberg T. Schulz A. Biebermann H. Hermsdorf T. Roömpler H. Sangkuhl K. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 104: 173-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Since many of the disease-causing proteins are not inherently nonfunctional, attempts to correct their folding and trafficking have attracted considerable attention. Several different ways to alleviate their incorrect cellular localization have been proposed, including genetic means (4Schoöneberg T. Sandig V. Wess J. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Clin.

Recently, a more elaborate strategy has been formulated, based on pharmacological chaperones, ligands, or substrates that can be used to specifically target misfolded/mistargeted proteins. The first GPCR that was targeted with membrane-permeable ligands was the V2 vasopressin receptor (12Morello J.P. Salahpour A. Laperriere A. Bernier V. Arthus M.F. Lonergan M. Petaöjaö-Repo U.

It has been hypothesized that pharmacological chaperones enhance cell surface targeting of GPCRs by binding and stabilizing immature receptors in the ER (8Morello J.P. Petaöjaö-Repo U.E. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 466-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 27Bernier V. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence supporting this notion has so far been lacking, and further experiments are needed to directly establish their mode of action. In the present study, we have used the human δ-opioid receptor (hδOR) as a model to directly test this hypothesis. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that only about 40% of newly synthesized hδORs are converted to mature form (28Petaöjaö-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13727-13736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and membrane-permeable opioid receptor antagonists and agonists are able to facilitate their maturation (22Petaöjaö-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Bhalla S. Laperriere A. Morello J.P. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In the present study, ER-retained hδOR precursors were found to bind [3H]diprenorphine with high affinity, showing that immature GPCRs, which contain their ligand-binding domain within the seven-transmembrane domain, gain binding ability early in their biosynthetic pathway before being exported from the ER. Moreover, both opioid antagonists and agonists were found to stabilize membrane-bound receptor precursors in an in vitro heat inactivation assay. Finally, since the ligand treatment was found to enhance dissociation of hδOR precursors from calnexin, we were able to conclude that the opioid receptor pharmacological chaperones enhance cell surface targeting of newly synthesized receptors by direct ligand-mediated stabilization and a consequent release from ER quality control. Materials—[15,16-3H]Diprenorphine (50.0–54.9 Ci/mmol) and Easytag Express 35S-protein labeling mix (1175 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H) was from Roche Applied Science.

DNA Constructs—DNA construct encoding the hδOR with a cleavable influenza hemagglutinin signal peptide (KTIIALSYIFCLVFA), N-terminal Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL), and C-terminal FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) was created. Briefly, cDNA for the hδOR (GenBank™ accession number U10504) (28Petaöjaö-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13727-13736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) (a generous gift from P. Walker, AstraZeneca R&D Montreal (Montreal, Canada)) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides 5′-CGCGCTAGCATGGAACCGGCCCCCTCC-3′ and 5′-GCCCCTAGGGGCGGCAGCGCCACCGCC-3′, digested with NheI/BlnI, ligated into the modified pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector (Invitrogen) (called pFT-SMMF), and transformed into Escherichia coli JM109. The pFT-SMMF vector was created as described previously (29Pietilaö E.M. Tuusa J.T. Apaja P.M. Aatsinki J.T. Hakalahti A.E. Rajaniemi H.J. Petaöjaö-Repo U.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26622-26629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The hδOR(D95A) mutant was created by introducing a single point mutation with QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (w/w) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (complete DMEM). A stable human embryonic kidney HEK293i cell line expressing Tet repressor was established as described elsewhere (30Apaja P.M. Tuusa J.T. Pietilaö E.M. Rajaniemi H.J. Petaöjaö-Repo U.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2243-2255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stable cell lines with inducible hδOR expression were established by co-transfecting receptor constructs and pOG44 plasmid (Invitrogen) into HEK293i cells with Lipofectamin 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) under BlasticidinS (4 μg/ml; Invivogen) and hygromycin (400 μg/ml; Invivogen) selection. They were isolated, expanded, and tested for zeozin sensitivity, β-galactosidase activity, and tetracycline-inducible expression of the hδOR by radioligand binding and Western blot analyses. The selected clones that were used for experiments showed very low basal but highly inducible hδOR expression (see Fig. 1), were sensitive to zeozin and lacked β-galactosidase activity. For experiments, 2 or 5 × 106 cells were plated onto 25- or 75-cm2 culture flasks, respectively, and cultured for 3 days in complete DMEM. Receptor expression was induced by adding tetracycline (0.02–1 μg/ml; Invitrogen) into the culture medium for different periods of time as indicated in the figure legends. BFA (5 μg/ml) and opioid and α-adrenergic ligands (10 μm) were added 60 min and CHX (20 μg/ml) 7 h after tetracycline, and cells were cultured further as indicated. Before CHX addition, cells were washed twice with complete DMEM. NG-108-15 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (w/w) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and HAT supplement (Invitrogen; 100 μm sodium hypoxanthine, 0.4 μm aminopterin, 16 μm thymidine) and cultured in the absence or presence of NTX for 24 h before harvesting. Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C. Metabolic Labeling with [35S]Methionine/Cysteine—For pulse-chase labeling, cells were first treated with 0.5 μg/ml tetracycline (60 min) and then incubated in methionine and cysteine-free DMEM (60 min) before labeling in fresh medium containing 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (40 min). After washing twice with the chase medium (DMEM supplemented with 5 mm methionine), cells were chased for different time periods as specified in Fig. 9. BFA (5 μg/ml) was included in the culture medium during the depletion, labeling, and chase, and NTB (10 μm) was included during the chase. Cells were then incubated on ice in PBS containing 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 10 min and harvested as described above. Preparation and Solubilization of Membranes and Whole Cell Extracts—Cells were homogenized for radioligand binding assays in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml benzamidine) and for immunoprecipitation in buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NEM, 2 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml benzamidine) with a Polytron homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax T-25; Ika) using three 5-s bursts at 19,000 rpm. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and pellets were rehomogenized and centrifuged. The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 20 min. The final pellets containing crude membrane fractions were washed twice and used immediately or stored at –70 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Membranes that were subjected for immunoprecipitation were solubilized in buffer C (0.5% (w/v) DDM in buffer B containing 140 mm NaCl and without NEM) by mixing the suspension on a magnetic stirrer for 60 min at 4 °C. Solubilized receptors were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Total cellular lysates were prepared by mixing thawed cells for 30 min at 4 °C in buffer C (Fig. 9) or buffer D (buffer A containing 0.5% (w/v) digitonin and 10 mm CaCl2 without NEM and EDTA) (Fig. 8). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Radioligand Binding Assays—Saturation and competition binding assays were carried out using 5–20 μg (HEK293 cells) or 30 μg (NG-108-15 cells) of membrane protein in a final volume of 300 μl of buffer A, containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA. One-point binding assays were performed using 5–60 μg of membrane protein. For saturation binding experiments, triplicate samples were incubated with an increasing concentration of [3H]diprenorphine, the final concentration ranging from 0.04 to 14 nm. For one-point binding assays, each triplicate contained 7–12 nm [3H]diprenorphine, and for competition experiments, each contained 2 nm [3H]diprenorphine and either NTX, SNC-80, or DPDPE at final concentrations ranging from 0.1 pm to 100 μm. Nonspecific binding was determined using 10 μm unlabeled NTX. After incubation at 22 °C for 60 min, membranes were harvested with cold 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, by rapid filtration over glass fiber filters (Filtermat B; PerkinElmer) presoaked in 0.1% (v/v) polyethyleneimine using a Brandel MWR-96T harvester. MeltiLex B/HS scintillator (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was melted onto the dried filters using MeltiLex Heat-Sealer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Finally, radioactivity was measured with a Wallac MicroBeta TriLux scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Heat Inactivation Assay—Cellular membranes were prepared in buffer E (buffer B without NEM) as described above. Suspensions (400/800 μg of protein) were incubated in an Eppendorf thermomixer (650 rpm) with or without opioid or α-adrenergic ligands (1 μm) at 37 °C for different periods of time, as indicated in the legend to Fig. 7. After terminating the incubations by placing the samples on ice, membranes were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The residual ligands were removed by washing twice with buffer E, and membranes were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A. The one-point binding assay was performed using 100 μl of suspension and a saturating concentration of [3H]diprenorphine as described above. Immunoprecipitation—Solubilized membranes or total cellular lysates were supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) BSA (160 μgof protein) and subjected to one-step or two-step immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG M2 antibody-agarose as described (28Petaöjaö-Repo U.E.

For SDS-PAGE, 100–150 μl of eluates was concentrated down to 25 μl by membrane filtration over Microcon-30 concentrators (Millipore), and 25 μl of SDS-sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue) was added. Alternatively, aliquots of lysates were subjected directly to SDS-PAGE after the addition of sample buffer. Deglycosylation of Immunoprecipitated Receptors—Immunoprecipitated receptors were eluted from anti-FLAG M2 antibody affinity resin with 1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, by incubating samples for 15 min at 22 °C and for 5 min at 95 °C. Eluates were diluted 7.5-fold with buffer F (0.5% (w/v) DDM, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, 50 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm 1,10-phenantroline, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml benzamidine), and Endo H was added to a final concentration of 50 milliunits/ml. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 16 h, and the reaction was terminated by adding SDS-sample buffer (60 μl). Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described elsewhere (28Petaöjaö-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13727-13736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and receptors were purified by immunoprecipitation as depicted above. SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting, and Fluorography—Samples were reduced by heating at 95 °C for 2 min in the presence of 50 mm dithiothreitol, and SDS-PAGE was run on a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN 3 cell apparatus (10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels) using reagents from Bio-Rad or from Amresco (Fig. 9). BioRad’s broad range molecular weight standards were used as markers and stained with Ponceau S (Sigma) after blotting. Proteins were electroblotted onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) using the Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot cell apparatus at 50 mA for 16 h. Blots were probed with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (0.5 μg/ml) or anti-calnexin antibody (1:10,000), followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse (1:15,000; Caltaq) or anti-rabbit (1:15,000; Jackson Immunochemicals) antibodies and enhanced ECL Western blotting detection reagents from GE Healthcare. Gels containing radiolabeled samples were treated for fluorography as described previously (29Pietilaö E.M. Tuusa J.T. Apaja P.M. Aatsinki J.T. Hakalahti A.E. Rajaniemi H.J. Petaöjaö-Repo U.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26622-26629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Films were scanned with an Agfa Duoscan HiD laser scanner, and data were quantified and analyzed as described (29Pietilaö E.M. Tuusa J.T. Apaja P.M. Aatsinki J.T. Hakalahti A.E. Rajaniemi H.J.

Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells (0.5 × 106) were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated 12-mm coverslips, cultured for 3 days, and treated as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Cell surface receptors were labeled under nonpermeabilizing conditions by adding anti-c-Myc antibody (1:1,000) into the medium for 30 min, and after washing twice with PBS, cell surface proteins were labeled with concanavalin A Alexa Fluor 594-conjugate in PBS (50 μg/ml) for 5 min. Cells were then washed and fixed with 2% (w/w) paraformaldehyde, PBS for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 45 min. Finally, cells were washed with PBS and treated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (1:200) antibody in the permeabilization buffer for 30 min. To label intracellular proteins, cells were fixed and permeabilized before the first antibody incubation (anti-FLAG M2 antibody (10 μg/ml) or anti-calreticulin antibody (1:200) in permeabilization buffer, 30 min), washed, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (1:200) or Alexa Fluor goat 568 anti-rabbit (1:250) antibodies for 30 min in the permeabilization buffer. All incubations were performed at 22 °C. After final washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Immumount (ThermoShandon) for confocal microscopy. Immunofluorescence staining was viewed with Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope using Zeiss Plan-Apo 100 × 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective under 488- and 647-nm wavelength excitation. Flow Cytometry—Detection of plasma membrane receptors by flow cytometry was performed as described earlier (32Petaöjaö-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Leskelaö T.T. Markkanen P.M.H. Tuusa J.T. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15780-15789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4.01 software. Saturation and competition curves were fitted to one- or two-binding site models using least-squares nonlinear regression analyses. The heat inactivation data were fitted to the one-phase exponential decay model. For statistical t tests, the limit of significance was set at p < 0.05, and data are presented as mean ± S.E. Inducible hδOR Expression in HEK293i-Myc-hδOR-FLAG Cells—To test the hypothesis that opioid receptor pharmacological chaperones are able to bind and stabilize newly synthesized receptors, immature ER-localized receptors needed to be separated from mature cell surface ones. For this purpose, we prepared a HEK293 cell line expressing the hδOR under tetracycline induction that allowed precise control of receptor expression. A C-terminal FLAG epitope and an N-terminal Myc epitope were added to enable receptor purification and detection of receptor expression at the cell surface, respectively. In addition, the receptor construct was modified to contain a cleavable hemagglutinin signal sequence (33Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at the N-terminal end of the Myc epitope to avoid possible ER translocation difficulties of nascent receptor molecules due to the added epitope. To induce receptor expression, HEK293i-Myc-hδOR-FLAG cells were treated with 0.5 μg/ml tetracycline for increasing periods of time, and the number of binding sites was assessed by subjecting crude membrane particles for a [3H]diprenorphine binding assay. As seen in Fig. 1A, the number of binding sites increased in time, and the half-time for maximal binding (60.9 ± 7.6 pmol/mg of membrane protein (mean ± S.E., n = 3)) was obtained at 13.1 ± 2.7 h. The appearance of receptors at the cell surface was then investigated by flow cytometry after labeling live cells with anti-c-Myc antibody and phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody. In accordance with the binding data, the fluorescence intensity increased during induction time and reached its maximum at 24 h after initiating the induction (Fig. 1B). To analyze the different receptor forms that were expressed in the HEK293i-Myc-hδOR-FLAG cells, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of tetracycline for 24 h, and receptors were solubilized from the crude membrane fraction, immunoprecipitated, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As seen in Fig. 1C, anti-FLAG M2 antibody recognized two major bands, a broad heterogeneous band of Mr 61,000 and a sharper one of Mr 47,000 from the induced cells (lanes 2–6 and 8), whereas no bands were a"

In order to identify novel connections between DNA repair pathways and ubiquitin signaling, we used mass spectrometry to identify proteins that interact with lysine 6-linked polyubiquitin chains. From this proteomic screen, we identified the DNA repair protein WRNIP1 (Werner helicase-interacting protein 1), along with nucleosome assembly protein 1, as novel ubiquitin-interacting proteins. We found that a small zinc finger domain at the N terminus of WRNIP1 is sufficient and necessary for noncovalent ubiquitin binding. This ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ) domain binds polyubiquitin but not monoubiquitin and appears to show no specificity for polyubiquitin chain linkage. A homologous zinc finger domain in RAD18 also binds polyubiquitin, suggesting a wider role for the UBZ domain in DNA repair. The WRNIP1 ubiquitin-binding function, along with its previously established ATPase activity, suggests that WRNIP1 plays a role in the metabolism of ubiquitinated proteins. Supporting this model, deletion of MGS1, the yeast homolog of WRNIP1, slows the rate of ubiquitin turnover, rendering yeast resistant to cycloheximide. We also find that WRNIP1 is heavily modified with ubiquitin and SUMO, revealing complex layers in the involvement of ubiquitin pathway proteins in the regulation of DNA repair. The novel ubiquitin-binding ability of WRNIP1 sheds light on the role of UBZ domain-containing proteins in postreplication DNA repair. DNA repair is regulated on many levels by ubiquitination.

Ubiquitination is an abundant post-translational modification that serves to regulate a wide variety of cellular pathways (1Shilatifard A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 2Huang T.T. D'Andrea A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 3Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin, a 76-amino acid polypeptide, is conjugated to one or more lysine residues within a substrate protein via a multistep, multienzyme process (4Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The consequences of ubiquitination for the substrate protein vary depending on the extent and type of ubiquitination. Monoubiquitination can lead to altered protein-protein interactions, relocalization, or the endocytosis of membrane-bound receptors (5Woelk T. Oldrini B. Maspero E. Confalonieri S. Cavallaro E. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2006; 8: 1246-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 6Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin can also undergo ubiquitination, leading to the formation of a polyubiquitin chain. Conjugation to a polyubiquitin chain in which the interubiquitin linkage occurs through Lys-48 generally results in the proteasome-mediated degradation of the substrate protein (7Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Other types of polyubiquitin chain linkages do not appear to result in proteasomal degradation but instead play a signaling role in pathways, such as the inflammatory response (8Deng L. Wang C.

For example, the proper execution of nucleotide excision repair depends upon the polyubiquitination and degradation of a subset of its component enzymes (12Sugasawa K. Okuda Y. Saijo M. Nishi R.

BRCA1, which plays an essential role in several DNA repair pathways, catalyzes the formation of an unusual type of polyubiquitin chain linked through Lys-6 (14Wu-Baer F. Lagrazon K. Yuan W. Baer R.

These Lys-6-linked polyubiquitin chains have been visualized at sites of DNA damage, perhaps serving as a scaffold for the assembly of DNA repair complexes (15Morris J.R. Solomon E. Hum. Mol.

To better understand the function of nondegradative polyubiquitin chains, we conducted a proteomic screen for proteins that interact with Lys-6-linked polyubiquitin chains. WRNIP1 (Werner helicase-interacting protein 1) and NAP1 (nucleosome assembly protein 1), were identified as candidate ubiquitin-interacting proteins through this screen. WRNIP1 was originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen through its interaction with WRN (Werner syndrome protein), a helicase important for genomic stability and telomere maintenance (16Yamagata K.

Annotated domains in WRNIP1 include a small Rad18 (radiation-sensitive 18)-like zinc finger at the N terminus and a AAA+ ATPase domain in the middle of the protein. The homology of WRNIP1 with the replication factor C family of clamp loader proteins, along with its ability to stimulate DNA polymerase δ synthesis of new DNA, suggests a possible role for WRNIP1 in replication and/or replication-dependent DNA repair (18Kawabe Y. Branzei D. Hayashi T. Suzuki H. Masuko T. Onoda F. Heo S.J. Ikeda H. Shimamoto A. Furuichi Y. Seki M. Enomoto T. J. Biol.

Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). WRNIP1/MGS1 (maintenance of genome stability 1) has been shown to be involved in postreplication DNA repair (20Hishida T. Ohno T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2019-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Postreplication repair is a division of the DNA damage response that ensures that DNA replication proceeds smoothly despite the presence of lesions that have evaded the timely attention of base or nucleotide excision repair (21Lehmann A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 66: 319-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The RAD6-RAD18 ubiquitin ligase complex is responsible for channeling lesions into the error-free homologous recombination-dependent pathway or the error-prone pathway, in which low fidelity DNA polymerases replicate past the damage (11Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). Evidence from yeast suggests that WRNIP1/Mgs1p negatively regulates postreplication repair (20Hishida T. Ohno T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2019-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Yeasts that overexpress Mgs1p are generally healthy but exhibit marked sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agents hydroxyurea, methyl methanesulfonate, and UV radiation (22Hishida T. Iwasaki H. Ohno T. Morishita T. Shinagawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8283-8289Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Hishida T. Ohya T. Kubota Y. Kamada Y. Shinagawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5509-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This increase in DNA damage sensitivity upon Mgs1p overexpression is dependent on the presence of RAD18, indicating that an overabundance of Mgs1p cripples the postreplication repair pathway (23Hishida T. Ohya T. Kubota Y. Kamada Y. Shinagawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5509-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that both WRNIP1 and RAD18 bind polyubiquitin through their zinc finger domains. This novel ubiquitin-binding activity suggests that WRNIP1 may exert its function in postreplication repair by modulating the turnover of ubiquitinated proteins. One phenotype exhibited by several yeast mutants deficient in pathways that regulate the turnover of ubiquitinated proteins is altered sensitivity to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (24McCusker J.H. Haber J.E. Genetics. 1988; 119: 303-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Gerlinger U.M. Guckel R. Hoffmann M. Wolf D.H. Hilt W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2487-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Under conditions of moderate translational inhibition, ubiquitin is the first protein to drop below the threshold required for continued growth (26Hanna J. Leggett D.S. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9251-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Any increase in ubiquitin levels, whether through ubiquitin overexpression or impaired ubiquitin degradation, results in resistance to cycloheximide (26Hanna J. Leggett D.S. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9251-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We find that mgs1Δ yeasts have an impaired turnover of ubiquitin and exhibit resistance to cycloheximide treatment. The finding that both WRNIP1 and RAD18 bind polyubiquitin and accelerate the turnover of ubiquitinated proteins highlights the intimate connection between the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and postreplication DNA repair. Plasmid Construction—pHA-UbLys-X series of plasmids has been previously described (27Nishikawa H. Ooka S. Sato K. Arima K. Okamoto J. Klevit R.E. Fukuda M. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3916-3924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). WRNIP1 was cloned by PCR into pCMV-FLAG-MAT2 (Sigma) and pMAL-c2e (New England Biolabs) using pET-WRNIP (19Tsurimoto T. Shinozaki A. Yano M. Seki M. Enomoto T. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as a template. The WRNIP1 D37A mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). A NAP1 cDNA (Open Biosystems, clone ID 2964631) was cloned by PCR into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). The RAD18 and WRNIP1 UBZ domains were constructed by annealing complementary synthetic phosphorylated oligonucleotides (supplemental Table 1) for 5 min at 95 °C and then allowing the DNA to cool to room temperature over the course of 1 h. The annealed product was then ligated into pMAL-c2e digested with KpnI and XbaI. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing or by mass spectrometry of the resulting proteins. Yeast Strains—Wild type parental yeast (strain BY4741, genotype MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 and a derivative mgs1Δ strain (clone ID 1994) were obtained from Open Biosystems from the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project collection (28Winzeler E.A.

Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3212) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-ubiquitin and anti-β-actin (clone P4D1 and catalog number 4967, respectively; Cell Signaling Technologies), anti-FLAG and anti-UBE1 (clones M2 and 2G2-3.5, respectively; Sigma), anti-SUMO1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier 1) (catalog number FL-101; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-GFP (mix of clones 7.1 and 13.1; Roche Applied Science), anti-calmodulin (catalog number 05-173; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and an anti-β-actin yeast loading control (catalog number ab8224; Abcam). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against rabbit and mouse were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated TrueBlot secondary antibody was obtained from Ebioscience. Polyclonal antisera against WRNIP1 were raised by immunizing rabbits with a mixture of two multiantigenic peptides with the sequences GETESRESYDAPPT (amino acids 103–116) and EELRGVDFFKQRRC (amino acids 652–665). The immunization protocol was carried out by Covance Research Products, Inc. (Denver, PA). Agarose beads were covalently conjugated to antibodies against the FLAG or HA epitope tags (Sigma). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 and HEK293T cells were cultured as recommended by American Type Culture Collection. Plasmid DNA was introduced into the cells by calcium phosphate transfection. Cell Lysis—HEK293 or HEK293T cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in cold Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, Roche Complete protease inhibitor tablet), sonicated in 0.5-s bursts for 20 s, and spun at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min to remove cell debris. Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysate was incubated for 1 h on a rotator at 4 °C with antibody-conjugated agarose beads. The beads were washed at least five times with Nonidet P-40 buffer and subsequently analyzed by mass spectrometry or SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Denaturing Protein Purification—Proteins were immunoprecipitated according to the protocol listed above and then eluted with the 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) at 100 μg/ml. Solid urea was added to the eluate to a final concentration of 8 m. This denatured eluate was then incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen), washed, and eluted with imidazole according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry—Following immunoprecipitation, bead-bound proteins were washed an additional three times in 20 mm diammonium phosphate, pH 8.0, and then incubated with 50 ng of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) for 8 h at 37 °C. The supernatant was removed from the beads, reduced by boiling for 5 min with 10 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (Pierce), and alkylated with 15 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h in the dark. An equal volume of 5% formic acid was added prior to sample cleanup with C18 Zip-Tips (Millipore). Mass Spectrometry—Samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using an LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron) attached to a MicroTech high pressure liquid chromatograph. Mass Spectrometry Data Analysis—LC-MS/MS data in the form of .RAW files were converted to .mzXML files by ReadW (version 1.6) and then searched against human protein data bases by the Global Proteome Machine interface to the X!Tandem algorithm (version 2006.06.01.2) (29Craig R. Beavis R.C. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1466-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). Searches were conducted using the following parameters: –2/+4 Da precursor ion mass error, 0.4 Da product ion mass error, complete carbamidomethylation of cysteines (+57 Da), partial oxidation of methionine (+16 Da), partial ubiquitination of lysine (+114.1 Da), and partial deamidation of asparagine and glutamine (–1 Da). Potential sumoylation sites were identified with SUMO-plot by Abgent (30Gramatikoff K. Wu C. Shi X. Fang F. Front. Biotechnol. Pharm. 2004; 4: 181-210Google Scholar). Calculation of Protein Abundance Factor—The relative abundance of proteins identified by mass spectrometry was calculated by the protein abundance factor method (31Powell D.W. Weaver C.M. Jennings J.L. McAfee K.J. He Y. Weil P.A. Link A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7249-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In short, the number of unique peptides identified from a particular protein is divided by that protein’s molecular mass in kilodaltons and then multiplied by 104. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant proteins expressed as maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusions were purified on amylose beads in column buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (New England Biolabs). Recombinant FLAG-tagged proteins were purified on anti-FLAG EZView agarose beads (Sigma) in Nonidet P-40 buffer. Ubiquitin Pull-down Assay—Ubiquitin binding was determined by incubating bead-bound purified recombinant proteins with 500 ng of ubiquitin (monoubiquitin or Lys-48- or Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains 1–7; Boston Biochem) in column buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed extensively in column buffer, and bead-bound protein complexes were eluted by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli buffer. Determination of Cycloheximide Resistance—Cycloheximide resistance was determined by spotting 10-fold serial dilutions of yeast, starting with 106 cells, on YPD plates containing the indicated cycloheximide concentrations. Ubiquitin Turnover Assay—Log phase yeast cultures were grown in YPD containing 200 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma), and aliquots were taken for Western blot as previously described (26Hanna J. Leggett D.S. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9251-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Western blot densitometry was performed on scans of the films with ImageJ (32Rasband W.S. ImageJ. 2006; (, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD)Google Scholar). Proteomic Screen for Ubiquitin-interacting Proteins—Polyubiquitin chains linked through Lys-6 have been implicated in DNA damage-related signaling pathways (14Wu-Baer F. Lagrazon K. Yuan W. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34743-34746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In order to identify proteins that interact with Lys-6-linked polyubiquitin chains, we used a construct expressing HA-tagged ubiquitin in which all of the lysines except Lys-6 are mutated to arginine (pHA-UbLys-6) (27Nishikawa H. Ooka S. Sato K. Arima K. Okamoto J. Klevit R.E. Fukuda M. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3916-3924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and performed an immunoprecipitation against the HA tag from transfected HEK293 cells. This strategy results in the purification of Lys-6-linked polyubiquitin chains and any accompanying covalently or noncovalently bound proteins. Peptides were eluted by incubation of the beads with trypsin. These tryptic peptides were analyzed in a shotgun fashion by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Resulting spectra were then searched against a human protein data base with the Global Proteome Machine software (29Craig R. Beavis R.C. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1466-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). The combined results of two independent Lys-6-linked ubiquitin immunoprecipitations lead to the identification of 53 proteins that were present only in the Lys-6-ubiquitin purification and not the untransfected control sample. Forty-eight of the 53 proteins were present in both immunoprecipitations. A protein identification is considered valid when at least two nonredundant peptides from the same protein have been assigned a statistically meaningful log(e) score less than or equal to –3.0. Identified proteins were ranked by their protein abundance factor (31Powell D.W. Weaver C.M. Jennings J.L. McAfee K.J. He Y. Weil P.A. Link A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7249-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thirty-one of these proteins can be classified as known participants in ubiquitin metabolism (Table 1). This category of proteins includes known or predicted E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, E3 ubiquitin ligases, deubiquitinating enzymes, and proteins with previously identified ubiquitin-binding domains. Interestingly, no subunits of the proteasome were identified, despite the fact that the proteasome is an abundant multiprotein complex with several polyubiquitin receptors (33Rao H. Sastry A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11691-11695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The lack of proteasome subunits in this purification is probably related to the apparent nondegradative function of Lys-6-linked polyubiquitin chains.TABLE 1Ubiquitin pathway proteins from Lys-6 ubiquitin immunoprecipitationsNameSymbolFunctionTotalUniquePAFUbiquitinUBIQ3701816,822Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2NUBE2NE25584678Ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1UBE1E1330453820Ubiquitin-specific protease 5-isopeptidase TUSP5DUB196353657Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2BUBE2BE22952890OTU, ubiquitin aldehyde binding 1OTUB1DUB3692875Valosin-containing proteinVCPBind104252800Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2L 3UBE2L3E2921117Ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1-like 2UBE1L2E328131103S-phase kinase-associated protein 1A (p19A)SKP1AE3221075UBX domain containing 8UBXD8Bind185933Cullin 3CUL3E3208900Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 TUBE2TE2142889Ubiquitin fusion degradation 1-likeUFD1Bind123777Cell division cycle 34 homologCDC34E372749BRCA1-associated proteinBRAPE395743Potassium channel modulatory factor 1KCMF1E343704Q5VTC0 (novel protein)—E3194635Nuclear protein localization 4 homologNPL4Bind264593Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation gr.

The N-terminal HA fusion and the lysine-to-arginine mutations allow for the discrimination of peptides derived from the pHA-UbLys-6 construct from peptides that come from endogenous ubiquitin. 301 of the 370 ubiquitin peptides identified in this screen can only originate from the pHA-UbLys-6 construct. None of the remaining peptides can be unambiguously attributed to endogenous ubiquitin, suggesting that the purified ubiquitin consists almost exclusively of the mutant ubiquitin construct in the form of monoubiquitin or Lys-6-linked polyubiquitin chains. A further 22 proteins identified in the Lys-6-ubiquitin immunoprecipitations were specific to the transfected sample and could not be classified as ubiquitin-proteasome pathway proteins. These proteins are considered candidate ubiquitin-interacting proteins (Table 2).TABLE 2Candidate Lys-6 ubiquitin-interacting proteinsNameSymbolTotalUniquePAFCalmodulinCALM12052976Werner helicase-interacting protein 1WRNIP15491248Nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 1NAP1154883Elongation factor 1-β (EF-1-β)EF1B52810Myosin-6MYO64311740Similar to 60 S ribosomal protein L7XP_00112589572683Similar to 60 S ribosomal protein L7aXP_00113124732662Complement component 1 Q-binding proteinC1QBP92643T-complex protein 1 subunit βTCPB33522T-complex protein 1 subunit ξTCPZ143517Heat shock protein HSP 90-βHS90B26448160 S ribosomal protein L3RL382436Elongation factor 1-α 2 (EF1A-2)EF1A232397T-complex protein 1 subunit δTCPD22345T-complex protein 1 subunit ηTCPH42338T-complex protein 1 subunit θTCPQ72335T-complex protein 1 subunit γTCPG3233160-kDa chaperonin/heat shock protein (Hsp60)CH60102327AAA ATPase domain-containing protein 3BATD3B22276Far upstream element-binding protein 2FUBP222274Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase α-1 chainAT1A1143266ATP-citrate synthaseACLY63248 Open table in a new tab WRNIP1 and NAP1 Co-immunoprecipitate with Ubiquitin—When ranked according to the estimated abundance in the purification, the top three candidate ubiquitin-interacting proteins are calmodulin, WRNIP1, and NAP1 (Table 2 and supplemental Tables 2 and 3). To confirm that these proteins specifically co-immunoprecipitate with ubiquitin and to test whether this interaction is specific to Lys-6-linked polyubiquitin chains, we used the pHA-UbLys-X set of ubiquitin constructs (27Nishikawa H. Ooka S. Sato K. Arima K. Okamoto J. Klevit R.E. Fukuda M. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3916-3924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Each of the five HA-ubiquitin constructs contains mutations at six of the seven lysines, leaving only one lysine available for polyubiquitin chain formation. Ubiquitin purifications were prepared from HEK293T cells transfected with the pHA-UbLys-X constructs by immunoprecipitation against the HA tag. The immunoprecipitations were blotted with antibodies against calmodulin and WRNIP1 (Fig. 1A). To test the interaction of NAP1 with ubiquitin, a cDNA encoding NAP1 was cloned into pEGFP-C1 vector so that NAP1 could be detected with anti-GFP antibodies. NAP1-GFP was cotransfected with the pHA-UbLys-X constructs (Fig. 1B). As a positive control, these immunoprecipitations were also blotted with an antibody against the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UBE1), one of the most abundant ubiquitin-proteasome pathway proteins identified from the initial Lys-6-ubiquitin purifications (Table 1). UBE1, WRNIP1, and NAP1 specifically co-immunoprecipitated with ubiquitin (Fig. 1, A and B). However, calmodulin was detected at equal levels in immunoprecipitations from transfected and untransfected cells and is therefore a nonspecific contaminant (Fig. 1A). Both WRNIP1 and NAP1 were detected in purifications of each of the five HA-ubiquitin constructs, suggesting that the ubiquitin interaction is not specific for Lys-6-linked chains. WRNIP1 was of particular interest, because it has been implicated in the cellular response to DNA damage, but little is known about its function. WRNIP1 was the ninth most abundant specific protein in the Lys-6-ubiquitin purifications, identified by nine unique tryptic peptides (supplemental Table 2). Since WRNIP1 appears to constitute a potential link between DNA repair and ubiquitination, we decided to further investigate the WRNIP1 interaction with ubiquitin. WRNIP1 Binds Polyubiquitin through its UBZ Domain—In order to test whether WRNIP1 is capable of noncovalent interactions with ubiquitin, we performed an in vitro binding assay, using recombinant FLAG-tagged WRNIP1 and wild type human ubiquitin. Bacterially expressed WRNIP1 was purified on anti-FLAG beads and then incubated with monoubiquitin or polyubiquitin chains linked through either Lys-48 or Lys-63. WRNIP1 bound both L"

Although Munc18c function is known to involve binding to the t-SNARE Syntaxin 4, a paucity of Munc18c-binding proteins has restricted elucidation of the mechanism by which it facilitates these exocytosis events. Toward this end, we have identified the double C2 domain protein Doc2β as a new binding partner for Munc18c. Unlike its granule/vesicle localization in neuronal cells, Doc2β was found principally in the plasma membrane compartment in islet beta cells and adipocytes. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation and GST interaction assays showed Doc2β-Munc18c binding to be direct and complexes to be devoid of Syntaxin 4. Supporting the notion of Munc18c binding with Syntaxin 4 and Doc2β in mutually exclusive complexes, in vitro competition with Syntaxin 4 effectively displaced Munc18c from binding to Doc2β. The second C2 domain (C2B) of Doc2β and an N-terminal region of Munc18c were sufficient to confer complex formation. Disruption of endogenous Munc18c-Doc2β complexes by addition of the Doc2β binding domain of Munc18c (residues 173–255) was found to selectively inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin release. Moreover, increased expression of Doc2β enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by ∼40%, whereas siRNA-mediated depletion of Doc2β attenuated insulin release. All changes in secretion correlated with parallel alterations in VAMP2 granule docking with Syntaxin 4. Taken together, these data support a model wherein Munc18c transiently switches from association with Syntaxin 4 to association with Doc2β at the plasma membrane to facilitate exocytosis.

Glucose homeostasis is maintained by a balance of insulin secretion and insulin action. Insulin is secreted from islet beta cells filled with mature insulin-containing granules which traffic to and fuse with the cell surface upon stimulation by elevated blood glucose. Upon detection of insulin and elevated circulating glucose levels by the skeletal muscle and adipose tissues the intracellular vesicles containing the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 translocate to the plasma membrane and facilitate glucose uptake into the cell (1Thurmond D.C.

Vesicle exocytosis entails the specific pairing of a vesicle-associated membrane protein v-SNARE (VAMP) with a binary cognate receptor complex t-SNARE composed of SNAP-25/23 and Syntaxin proteins at the target membrane to form the SNARE core complex (3Jahn R.

Neurosci. 2002; 3: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). SNARE protein functions are further regulated by interaction with the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) secretory proteins, of which three plasma membrane-localized homologues exist in mammalian cells: Munc18a, Munc18b, and Munc18c (5Garcia E.P.

However among these, only the Munc18c isoform can bind with and regulate the t-SNARE protein Syntaxin 4 (7Tellam J.T. Macaulay S.L. McIntosh S. Hewish D.R. Ward C.W. James D.E. J. Biol.

Crystallographic and NMR studies support the concept that the Munc18 protein may keep its cognate Syntaxin in a “closed” conformation (17Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 18Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Very recent studies further suggest that the Munc18 protein assists the transition of Syntaxin to the open state, possibly by stabilizing a labile transition half-open state of Syntaxin (20Zilly F.E. Sorensen J.B. Jahn R. Lang T. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e330Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Shen J. Tareste D.C. Paumet F. Rothman J.E. Melia T.J. Cell. 2007; 128: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Previous studies of Munc18c-Syntaxin 4 kinetics in 3T3L1 adipocytes are consistent with this model (9Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33876-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 22Araki S. Tamori Y. Kawanishi M. Shinoda H. Masugi J. Mori H. Niki T. Okazawa H. Kubota T. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently demonstrated that Munc18c becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and transiently dissociates from Syntaxin 4 upon stimulation in both islet beta cells and in 3T3L1 adipocytes (23Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17624-17634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and this dissociation was correlated with increased SNARE docking. However, it has recently been demonstrated that in vitro, Munc18c can associate with the heterotrimeric SNARE core complex, with VAMP2 included (24Latham C.F. Lopez J.A. Hu S.H. Gee C.L. Westbury E. Blair D.H. Armishaw C.J. Alewood P.F. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Martin J.L. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1408-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These data suggest that a cellular factor may be required to mediate the transient displacement of Munc18c. There is precedence for the existence of proteins that bind and impact SM-Syntaxin complexes. For example, the yeast protein Ypt1p, a Rab GTPase, binds the Sly1p-Sed5p complex, yeast SM-Syntaxin homologues (25Grabowski R. Gallwitz D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In neurons, the SM protein Munc18-1 has several known binding proteins other than its cognate Syntaxin, several of which are C2 domain-containing proteins (26Tsuboi T. Fukuda M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2101-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Verhage M. de Vries K.J. Roshol H. Burbach J.P. Gispen W.H. Sudhof T.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). One of these is Doc2β, which was shown to bind directly to Munc18-1 (27Verhage M. de Vries K.J. Roshol H. Burbach J.P. Gispen W.H. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 453-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Doc2β binds to a range of ligands including calcium, phospholipids, and intracellular proteins. Whereas a second isoform, Doc2α, is found primarily in brain/neuronal tissue, Doc2β is more widely expressed (27Verhage M. de Vries K.J. Roshol H. Burbach J.P. Gispen W.H. Sudhof T.C.

In this report we demonstrate that Doc2β is expressed in insulin-secreting beta cells as well as insulin-responsive adipocytes, in which it associates with Munc18c in a manner mutually exclusive of Munc18c's other known binding partner Syntaxin 4. Our results delineate binding domains of each protein sufficient to confer the interaction and further show that endogenous Munc18c-Doc2β association is functionally important for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Loss of association was coupled to decreased SNARE docking (Syntaxin 4 association with VAMP2 granules), whereas increased association or Doc2β expression was correlated with increased SNARE docking. In vitro studies revealed that Syntaxin 4 could displace Munc18c from preformed Munc18c-Doc2β complexes in a dose-dependent fashion, altogether supportive of a model in which Munc18c switches binding partners from Syntaxin 4 to Doc2β at the plasma membrane to promote exocytosis. Materials—Rabbit anti-Munc18c and anti-GLUT4 antibodies were generated as previously described (9Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

Doc2β siRNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX): siDoc2 number 2-GGCAAAUAAGCUCAGAACAtt; siDoc2 number 1-UCAUCACACACGGAGAUCCtc. Plasmids—The pcDNA3.1-Doc2β-myc DNA construct was generated by subcloning a PCR-generated mouse Doc2β fragment into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pcDNA3.1/myc-His(-) vector (Invitrogen). The pBluescriptIIKS(-)-Doc2β (a kind gift from Dr. Mitsunori Fukuda) was used as the template in a GC-rich PCR reaction system (Roche Applied Science) using the following primers: forward (5′-AGACTCGAGGCCTGCATGACCCTC) and reverse (5′-AGAAAGCTTGGTCGCTGAGTAC). GST-Doc2β fusion protein constructs pGEX-2T mouse Doc2β-C2A (amino acids 123–257), pGEX-2T mouse Doc2β-C2B (amino acids 257–375), pGEX-2T mouse Doc2β-C2AB (amino acids 123–375) were gifts from Dr. Mitsunori Fukuda.

The Munc18c-GFP deletion constructs were generated as previously described (23Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17624-17634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An additional deletion construct, Munc18c-(173–255)-GFP was generated by subcloning a PCR-generated fragment of the 173–255 region into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech), using the following primers: forward (5′-AGAGGATCCATGGAGGCAATGGCT), reverse (5′-AGAGAATTCTCATGCCTGAAAGGTCA). The pET-28a(+)-His-Munc18c construct was made by subcloning a PCR-generated full-length Munc18c fragment, using pcDNA3.1-Munc18c DNA as template (9Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S.

The pAd5CMV-FLAG-Munc18c was generated by subcloning FLAG-Munc18c fragment excised from pcDNA3.1-FLAG-Munc18c (33Thurmond D.C. Pessin J.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3565-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using SpeI for insertion into SpeI-cut pAd5CMV vector. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Secretion Assays—MIN6 beta cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM with 25 mm glucose) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 292 μg/ml l-glutamine, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol as described previously (15Spurlin B.A. Thurmond D.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). MIN6 beta cells at 50–60% confluence were transfected with 40 μg of plasmid DNA per 10 cm2 dish using transfectin (Bio-Rad) to obtain ∼30–50% transfection efficiency. After 48 h of incubation, cells were washed twice with and incubated for 2 h in freshly prepared modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (MKRBB: 5 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl, 15 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml BSA). Cells were stimulated with 20 mm glucose or 50 mm KCl for the times indicated in the figures. Cells were subsequently lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 μm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 137 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin), and lysates were cleared by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C for subsequent use in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. For measurement of human C-peptide release, MIN6 beta cells were transiently co-transfected with each plasmid plus human proinsulin cDNA (kind gift from Dr. Chris Newgard, Duke University), using transfectin with 2 μg of each DNA per 35-mm dish of cells at 50% confluence. 48 h following transfection, cells were preincubated for 2 h in MKRBB buffer and stimulated with 20 mm glucose for 1 h. MKRBB was collected for quantitation of human C-peptide released. Transfection of siRNA oligonucleotides into MIN6 cells was achieved using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 100 nm oligonucleotides to obtain ∼70–80% transfection efficiency. A non-targeting RNA (scrambled siRNA, obtained from Ambion) was included as a control in parallel experiments. Transfected cells were maintained in supplemented DMEM for 48 h, starved in MKRBB and stimulated as described above, and insulin-secreted into the MKRBB quantitated by RIA. Cells were harvested in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for detecting Doc2β depletion. CHO-K1 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 292 μg/ml l-glutamine. At 80–90% confluence, cells were electroporated with 40 μg of DNA as previously described (9Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33876-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). After 48 h of incubation, cells were harvested in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and lysates cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C for subsequent use in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractions of beta cells were isolated as described previously (34Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1944-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, MIN6 beta cells at 80–90% confluence were harvested into 1 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate containing the protease inhibitors leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (4 μg/ml), pepstatin (2 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μm). Cells were disrupted by 10 strokes through a 27-gauge needle, and homogenates were centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min. Postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 5,500 × g for 15 min, and the subsequent supernatant centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min to obtain the secretory granule fraction in the pellet. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the cytosolic fraction. Plasma membrane fractions (PM) were obtained by mixing the postnuclear pellet with 1 ml of Buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and 2 volumes of Buffer B (2 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The mixture was overlaid with Buffer A and centrifuged at 113,000 × g for 1 h to obtain an interface containing the plasma membrane fraction. The interface was collected and diluted to 2 ml with homogenization buffer for centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was collected as the plasma membrane fraction. All pellets were resuspended in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer to solubilize membrane proteins. Subcellular fractions of 3T3L1 adipocytes were obtained using the differential centrifugation method as described previously (9Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33876-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3L1 adipocytes were washed with and resuspended in HES buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 255 mm sucrose containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were sheared 10 times through a 22-gauge needle and centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The low speed (HDM) fraction was obtained by centrifugation of the resulting supernatant at 41,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 75 min at 4 °C to generate the high speed (LDM) fraction. The plasma membrane fraction (PM) was obtained by resuspending the pellet from the initial 19,000 × g centrifugation in HES buffer followed by layering onto a 1.12 m sucrose cushion for centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The plasma membrane layer was then removed from the cushion and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min, and that pellet then resuspended in HES buffer. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—MIN6 beta cells were preincubated in MKRBB for 2 h followed by glucose stimulation. Cells were subsequently lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. MIN6 beta cell-cleared detergent homogenates (2–3 mg) were combined with rabbit anti-Munc18c antibody, rabbit anti-Syntaxin4 antibody, or rabbit anti-Doc2β antibody for 2 h at 4 °C followed by a second incubation with protein G Plus-agarose for 2 h. The resultant immunoprecipitates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membranes for immunoblotting. Munc18c, Syntaxin 4, and Doc2β antibodies were used at 1:5000, 1:500, and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively, and secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were diluted at 1:5000 for visualization by chemiluminescence. Immunoprecipitations using CHO-K1 detergent-cleared cell lysates were performed similar to that of the MIN6 cell lysates. Recombinant Proteins and Interaction Assays—GST-Doc2β, GST-Doc2β-C2AB, GST-Doc2β-C2A, GST-Doc2β-C2B, and GST-Syntaxin 4 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (35Min J. Okada S. Kanzaki M. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Ceresa B.P. Syu L.J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Recombinant Syntaxin 4 and Doc2β proteins were obtained following thrombin cleavage of GST-Syntaxin 4, GST-Doc2β, respectively. Syntaxin 1A protein was purchased from Synaptic Systems. BSA control protein was purchased from Pierce. Recombinant His-tagged Munc18c was also expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA nickel-chelating resin (Invitrogen) under native conditions (50 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8). Eluted protein was further dialyzed overnight in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol. The interaction of GST-Doc2β with His-Munc18c was performed by incubating 2 μg of either GST-Doc2β-C2AB, GST-Doc2β-C2A, GST-Doc2β-C2B linked to Sepharose beads with 2 μg of recombinant His-Munc18c protein in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Following three washes with lysis buffer, proteins were eluted from the Sepharose beads and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membrane for immunoblotting. Adenoviral Transduction of MIN6 Cells—MIN6 cells at 60% confluence were transduced with pAd5CMV-Munc18c CsCl-purified particles (generated by the University of Iowa Gene Targeting Vector Core, Iowa City, IA) for 2 h at 37 °C (MOI = 100). Transduced cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 48 h in complete medium at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Transduced cells were subsequently preincubated in MKRBB for 2 h and stimulated with 20 mm d-glucose for 5 min. Cleared detergent lysates were prepared as described above for the GST pull-down assay. Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were evaluated for statistical significance using the Student's t test. Doc2β and Munc18c Associate in MIN6 Beta Cells—Doc2β is considered to be a ubiquitously expressed protein, enriched in brain, heart, and lung tissues (27Verhage M. de Vries K.J. Roshol H. Burbach J.P. Gispen W.H. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 453-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 31Sakaguchi G. Orita S. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but expression in adipocytes and islet cells has not yet been established. To address this, tissue and cultured cell lysates were used for immunoblotting to detect the presence of Doc2β protein using a previously validated antibody provided by Dr. Matthias Verhage. The Doc2β antibody recognized a single 45-kDa band in both human and mouse islet lysates, MIN6 beta cell lysate and recombinant purified full-length Doc2β protein (Fig. 1A). Moreover, of the three subcellular fractions of MIN6 beta cells examined, Doc2β was almost exclusively localized to the PM fraction (Fig. 1A, lane 4), and was nearly undetectable in granule and cytosolic fractions (data not shown). The purity of the fractions was validated by the presence of the PM protein Syntaxin 1A exclusively in the plasma membrane fraction (Fig. 1A) and by insulin content as we have documented previously (15Spurlin B.A. Thurmond D.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 34Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1944-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In 3T3L1 adipocytes, Doc2β was also primarily localized to the PM fraction (Fig. 1B), with very little present in intracellular vesicle fractions (LDM and HDM). Subcellular fractions prepared from insulin-stimulated 3T3L1 adipocytes were validated by detection of GLUT4 protein in PM, LDM, and HDM fractions and detection of Syntaxin 4 protein principally in the PM fraction. RT-PCR was also used to confirm the presence of Doc2β mRNA in the MIN6 cells (data not shown). Thus, Doc2β and Munc18c both localize to the PM fraction in cell types where Munc18c-Syntaxin 4 complexes are known to be important for regulated exocytotic events. To next determine whether Doc2β could bind to Munc18c, Doc2β was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli and attached to beads as bait for precipitating interacting proteins. To increase the abundance of Munc18c and enhance detection of a binding event, MIN6 lysates prepared from cells transduced to express recombinant FLAG-tagged Munc18c were initially used. Both anti-FLAG and anti-Munc18c antibodies detected Munc18c in precipitates with GST-Doc2β but not GST control (Fig. 2A). Coimmunoprecipitation was used as an independent approach to confirm this interaction.

Genetic disruption of JNK1, but not JNK2, improves insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. We applied RNA interference to investigate the specific role of hepatic JNK1 in contributing to insulin resistance in DIO mice. Adenovirus-mediated delivery of JNK1 short-hairpin RNA (Ad-shJNK1) resulted in almost complete knockdown of hepatic JNK1 protein without affecting JNK1 protein in other tissues. Liver-specific knockdown of JNK1 resulted in significant reductions in circulating insulin and glucose levels, by 57 and 16%, respectively. At the molecular level, JNK1 knockdown mice had sustained and significant increase of hepatic Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, knockdown of JNK1 enhanced insulin signaling in vitro. Unexpectedly, plasma triglyceride levels were robustly elevated upon hepatic JNK1 knockdown. Concomitantly, expression of proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1β, glucokinase, and microsomal triacylglycerol transfer protein was increased. Further gene expression analysis demonstrated that knockdown of JNK1 up-regulates the hepatic expression of clusters of genes in glycolysis and several genes in triglyceride synthesis pathways. Our results demonstrate that liver-specific knockdown of JNK1 lowers circulating glucose and insulin levels but increases triglyceride levels in DIO mice.

Obesity has become an epidemic worldwide and is strongly associated with the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (1Wellen K.E. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (3247) Google Scholar). Clinical evidence has further demonstrated a correlation between obesity and type 2 diabetes and abnormal inflammatory responses. Altered production of pro-inflammatory cytokines leads to insulin resistance, whereas high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs promote insulin sensitivity (1Wellen K.E. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Clin.

There are three highly-related JNK proteins: JNK1 and JNK2 are broadly expressed while JNK3 is predominantly expressed in neurons (5Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3676) Google Scholar).

JNK activity is significantly elevated in various tissues, such as liver, muscle, and fat, in type 2 diabetic patients and in animal models of obesity and diabetes (4Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L.

Activation of JNK interferes with the metabolic action of insulin by increasing phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) on serine-307 (IRS-1-p-Ser-307), thereby inhibiting the interaction of IRS-1 with the insulin receptor (7Aguirre V.

When fed a high fat diet, mice with genetic disruption of JNK1, but not JNK2, exhibit significantly improved insulin sensitivity and enhanced insulin signaling (4Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L.

Knock-out of JNK1 in leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice results in significant reduction of circulating glucose and insulin levels (4Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L. Gorgun C.Z. Uysal K.T. Maeda K.

Short double-stranded RNA, 19-29 nucleotides in length, can specifically silence target genes without inducing a toxic interferon response (10Novina C.D. Sharp P.A. Nature. 2004; 430: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 11Dorsett Y. Tuschl T. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 318-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Systemic delivery of recombinant adenovirus has been shown to specifically target liver without affecting other tissues, such as brain, muscle, adipose, and heart (12Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). To understand the liver-specific contribution of JNK1 to insulin resistance, we applied adenovirus-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for JNK1 in an animal model of mild obesity and insulin resistance, the DIO mouse. An advantage of this approach over transgenic methods is the ability to determine the effects of acute inhibition of an enzyme or pathway in an adult animal; a more relevant validation tool when considering potential effects of pharmacologic intervention. Our results indicate that liver-specific knockdown of JNK1 improved whole body insulin sensitivity and enhanced hepatic insulin signaling in DIO mice. Surprisingly, significant knockdown of hepatic JNK1 also resulted in a robust increase in circulating triglyceride levels, suggesting a role of JNK1 in lipid metabolism. Knockdown of JNK1 significantly increased the expression of PPARγ coactivator-1β (PGC-1β). PGC-1β has been implicated as a key regulator affecting hepatic lipogenesis and lipoprotein secretion (13Lin J. Yang R. Tarr P.T. Wu P.H. Handschin C. Li S. Yang W. Pei L. Uldry M. Tontonoz P.

An analysis of gene expression changes provides an explanation for increased circulating triglycerides and lowered blood glucose and insulin levels found in JNK1-knockdown DIO mice. Generation of Synthetic siRNAs, Vectors Expressing shRNAs, and Recombinant Adenoviruses—An RNAi sequence specific for mouse JNK1 was selected to specifically match only mouse JNK1 when analyzed using a genome-wide Blast search (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi). The sense sequence for the JNK1 RNAi sequence contains 21 nucleotides: 5′-GCAGAAGCAAACGTGACAACA. To create an shRNA, an 8-nucleotide loop (TCAAGACT) was placed to separate the sense and antisense sequences for RNAi, and the entire sequence was cloned into a pENTR™ vector driven by the U6 promoter (Invitrogen).

Surowy, unpublished data. showed it to be efficacious, and the shRNA was transferred to an adenoviral pAd/BLOC-KIT™-DEST vector by Gateway LR recombination (Invitrogen). Recombinant adenovirus containing JNK1 shRNA (Ad-shJNK1) was generated by transfection of the vector into HEK293 cells as described previously (12Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The control adenovirus containing shRNA targeting GFP (Ad-shGFP) has been described previously (15Huang A. Chen Y. Wang X. Zhao S. Su N. White D.W. FEBS Lett. 2004; 558: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Human JNK1 siRNA and control siRNA (catalog no. 003514) were purchased from Dharmacon Inc. A recombinant adenovirus overexpressing cDNA for β-galactosidase was obtained from Millennium Pharmaceuticals. Cell Culture and Transfection—Primary hepatocytes from CD1 mice were prepared as previously described (16Yang R. Cao L. Gasa R. Brady M.J. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1514-1523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cells were plated into 6-well collagen-coated plates and allowed to reach 50% confluency. The hepatocytes were treated with adenoviruses containing shRNAs at a concentration of 5 × 108 viral particles per milliliter of culture medium for 18 h. Cell incubation was continued in fresh medium for a further 24 h before collection and analysis. Human JNK1 siRNAs were transfected into HepG2 cells using TransIT-TKO reagent (Mirus Inc.). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell lysates were collected and analyzed further. Animal Studies—Male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) were housed on a 12-h light-dark cycle and allowed free access to water and a high fat diet (Research Diet D12492I, 60% kcal from fat) for 16-18 weeks. Adenoviruses were purified and diluted in saline solution, and 2 × 1011 viral particles were delivered into the animals by a single tail-vein injection on day 0 as described previously (17Yang R. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23418-23425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Animals were fed ad libitum and were sacrificed at day 5 after adenovirus injection. Blood and tissue samples were collected for further analysis. Tissue samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For fasting studies, animals on day 5 were fasted overnight for 16 h and were then sacrificed at day 6. An insulin tolerance test was performed in DIO mice at day 5 after adenovirus injection, after a 4-h fast. Insulin was delivered by intraperitoneal injection of 0.25 unit/kg insulin (Humulin-R, Lilly). Blood glucose levels were monitored every 30 min post injection, up to 120 min. Blood glucose levels were measured using a Precision PCx glucose meter (Abbott Laboratories). The Abbott Laboratories Animal Care and Use Committee approved all procedures. Sample Analysis—Liver and fat tissues were pulverized and homogenized in lysis buffer as described before (17Yang R. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23418-23425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Western blot was performed and protein-antibody complexes were visualized using ECL plus (PerkinElmer Life Science) as suggested by the manufacturer. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies followed by Western analysis detecting insulin receptor and IRS-1. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis was performed with anti-IRS-1 antibodies followed by Western analysis detecting PI3K subunit p85. JNK antibody (sc571), which detects both JNK1 and JNK2, glucokinase, and SREBP1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against IRS-1, IRS-1-p-Ser-307, insulin receptor, PI3K p85, phosphotyrosine, Akt, and Akt-p-Ser-473 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). An electrochemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was used to detect c-Jun phosphorylation (catalog no. K111CGD, Meso-Scale-Discovery). Real-time PCR analysis was performed on cDNA prepared from total RNA isolated from mouse tissues using TRIzol™ and Qiagen RNeasy kits. The real-time PCR reaction used SYBR Green supermix (catalog no. 170-8862, Bio-Rad), and data were analyzed as previously described (17Yang R. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23418-23425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels were normalized with 18 S RNA and data were represented relative to the control Ad-shGFP-treated group. Primer sequences for different genes are shown in Table 1. The hepatic RNA samples from ad libitum fed mice were analyzed by using an Affymetrix microarray. Five μg of total RNA from each sample was used to prepare a biotin-labeled cRNA target using standard Affymetrix protocols (Enzo Biochem). 10 μg of prepared cRNA for each sample was hybridized with an Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 array. After hybridization and chip scanning, quality control data were evaluated to ensure all chip data were of good quality. Image analysis and data normalization were performed using Affymetrix and Rosetta Resolver 6.0 software (Rosetta Inpharmatics) using the Resolver Affymetrix error model. Within Resolver, expression levels for each sample were compared against the average of the vehicle-treated control group. Data from individual probe sets were grouped by Entrez Gene ID (18Maglott D. Ostell J. Pruitt K.D. Tatusova T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 (-D45): D39PubMed Google Scholar) for visualization by gene expression heat map as described in each figure.

Plasma insulin was measured using kits from ALPCO. Plasma free fatty acids were measured using kits from WACO Chemicals, and plasma total cholesterol was measured using Infinity kits from ThermoElectron Corp. Plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities were analyzed using kits from Sigma. Plasma and liver triglyceride levels were determined using Infinity Kits from ThermoElectron Corp. Liver histological analysis was performed using β-galactosidase antibodies (Cortex Biochem). Plasma triglyceride and cholesterol profiling was performed with a SMART fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pfizer) using a Superose 6 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). Pooled plasma samples (50 μl) were loaded onto the column. The elution flow rate was 40 μl/min in a running buffer consisting of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Fractions of 40 μl were collected, and triglyceride and cholesterol contents were determined using enzymatic kit assays (Infinity, ThermoElectron Corp.). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by using the unpaired Student’s t test. Statistical significance was assumed at p < 0.05. Adenovirus-mediated Delivery of JNK1 shRNA Induced Robust Reduction of Hepatic JNK1 Protein in DIO Mice—Recombinant adenovirus expressing an effective shRNA against JNK1 (Ad-shJNK1) was designed, and we confirmed its robust knockdown of JNK1 protein in primary mouse hepatocytes.6 To evaluate the transduction efficiency of adenovirus-mediated delivery in DIO mice, recombinant adenovirus expressing the β-galactosidase gene was delivered by a single tail-vein injection. Histological evaluation demonstrated that delivery of 2 × 1011 viral particles expressing β-galactosidase resulted in almost 100% transduction of liver cells 5 days after injection (Fig. 1A). We used the same viral dose for delivery of Ad-shJNK1 or a control recombinant adenovirus expressing shRNA against GFP protein (Ad-shGFP) into DIO mice. Knockdown was expressed relative to the Ad-shGFP control. A robust 95% reduction of hepatic JNK1 protein was observed (Fig. 1B). Knockdown of JNK1 by Ad-shJNK1 was specific to JNK1 and did not affect JNK2 protein levels in liver (Fig. 1B). Consistent with our observations (21Wilcox D.M. Yang R. Morgan S.J. Nguyen P.T. Voorbach M.J. Jung P.M. Haasch D.L. Lin E. Bush E.N. Opgenorth T.J. Jacobson P.B. Collins C.A. Rondinone C.M. Surowy T. Landschulz K.T. J. RNAi Gene Silencing. 2007; 3: 225-236Google Scholar) and other reports (12Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) that systemic delivery of recombinant adenovirus predominantly transduces genes into liver, JNK1 protein was not decreased in fat tissues (Fig. 1C). Hepatic JNK1 mRNA was significantly reduced, whereas no reduction of JNK2 mRNA was noted (data not shown). Liver c-Jun phosphorylation was significantly reduced by 70% in Ad-shJNK1-treated mice (Fig. 1D), confirming reduced total JNK activity as a result of Ad-shJNK1 delivery. Liver-specific Knockdown of JNK1 Reduced Circulating Glucose and Insulin Levels in DIO Mice—To determine the effects of decreased hepatic JNK1 protein on whole body metabolic parameters, we evaluated plasma from DIO mice on day 5 after a single injection of Ad-shJNK1. In ad libitum fed mice, Ad-shJNK1 treatment resulted in a significant 16% reduction in blood glucose levels compared with control Ad-shGFP treatment (144 ± 14 versus 172 ± 28 mg/dl, respectively) (Fig. 2A). Plasma insulin levels were also significantly lowered, by 57%, in Ad-shJNK1-treated mice compared with control Ad-shGFP-treated mice (0.31 ± 0.07 versus 0.72 ± 0.31 ng/ml, respectively) (Fig. 2B). No significant changes in blood glucose and plasma insulin levels were observed in the control Ad-shGFP-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice. Consistent with results in fed mice, liver-specific knockdown of JNK1 also led to reduced blood glucose and insulin levels in 16-h-fasted DIO mice (data not shown). There was no obvious liver toxicity associated with Ad-shRNA delivery, as determined by histological analysis, as well as measurement of plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (data not shown). On day 5 after Ad-shRNA delivery, an insulin tolerance test was performed in 4-h-fasted DIO mice. A single intraperitoneal injection of 0.25 unit/kg insulin was given, and blood glucose levels were monitored every 30 min for 2 h. Ad-shJNK1-treated mice had significantly reduced blood glucose levels at several time points compared with control Ad-shGFP-treated mice (Fig. 2C). The insulin tolerance test results were also plotted as the percentage of initial glucose level at each time point (Fig. 2D). Compared with control Ad-shGFP-treated mice, Ad-shJNK1-treated mice had reduced blood glucose levels at each time point. These differences failed to reach statistical significance because one out of the seven animals in the Ad-shJNK1-treated group had an unexplained robust increase (the remaining six mice had a robust significant reduction) in blood glucose levels compared with the initial point during the insulin tolerance test. We did not observe any significant changes in body weight or epididymal fat mass with treatment. Taken together, our data demonstrate that liver-specific knockdown of JNK1 significantly decreases glucose and insulin levels and tends to improve insulin sensitivity in DIO mice. RNAi-mediated JNK1 Knockdown Enhanced Hepatic Insulin Signaling in Vivo and in Vitro—Increased phosphorylation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt, also called protein kinase B, has been considered a marker of enhanced insulin sensitivity. In our studies, liver-specific knockdown of JNK1 protein by Ad-shJNK1 in ad libitum fed mice resulted in a significant 3-fold increase in hepatic Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 (Akt-p-Ser-473) (Fig. 3A). After a 16-h fast, hepatic Akt-p-Ser-473 was also significantly increased, >10-fold compared with levels observed in control Ad-shGFP-treated mice (Fig. 3B). No change of total Akt proteins was observed among different groups of treated mice (Fig. 3, A and B). Additionally, Akt-p-Ser-473 was significantly increased after an insulin tolerance test in DIO mice treated with Ad-shJNK1 (data not shown). Knockdown of JNK1 did not change Akt-p-Ser-473 in epididymal fat tissue compared with control groups in ad libitum fed mice (data not shown). Furthermore, knockdown of JNK1 increased phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3, a downstream target of AKT, supportive of enhanced hepatic insulin signaling in DIO mice (data not shown). To examine the effects of JNK1 knockdown on insulin signaling in vitro, primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with Ad-shJNK1 or control Ad-shGFP for 2 days followed by a 20-h chronic incubation with 10 μm insulin. Consistent with our in vivo results, Western blot analysis demonstrated >3-fold increased Akt-p-Ser-473 without changes to total Akt protein, concomitant with robust knockdown of JNK1 protein by Ad-shJNK1 (Fig. 3C). Compared with control Ad-shGFP-treated cells, knockdown of JNK1 resulted in enhanced response of Akt-p-Ser-473 upon acute treatment with insulin (10 nm insulin for 10 min, data not shown). We further applied RNAi to knock down JNK1 in human hepatoma-derived HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were transfected with 100 nm of an effective human JNK1 siRNA or control non-targeting siRNA for 48 h, followed by incubation with 10 μm insulin for 20 h to induce an insulin resistance condition. Compared with control non-targeting siRNA-transfected cells, Western blot analysis demonstrated that human JNK1 siRNA robustly reduced JNK1 protein. Also consistent with our in vivo Ad-shJNK1 results, knockdown of JNK1 in HepG2 cells by human JNK1 siRNA resulted in significantly increased Akt-p-Ser-473 in response to chronic insulin treatment (Fig. 3D), without affecting total Akt analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). Compared with control siRNA-treated HepG2 cells, siRNA-mediated knockdown of JNK1 increased tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor and IRS-1 in response to acute 10 nm insulin treatment (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, the association of IRS-1 with the PI3K subunit, p85, was also increased in JNK1 knockdown cells (Fig. 3F). Our observations indicate that knockdown of JNK1 enhances insulin signaling in vivo and in vitro. Liver-specific Knockdown of JNK1 Robustly Increased Circulating Triglyceride Levels Associated with Increased Hepatic PGC-1β, Glucokinase, and MTP Expression—Plasma triglyceride levels were examined following recombinant adenoviral treatment in ad libitum fed and 16-h-fasted DIO mice. To our surprise, in ad libitum fed mice, liver-specific knockdown of JNK1 by Ad-shJNK1 resulted in a robust 2.8-fold increase in circulating triglyceride levels compared with control Ad-shGFP treatment (250 ± 84 versus 88 ± 38 mg/dl, respectively) (Fig. 4A). In 16-h-fasted mice, Ad-shJNK1 treatment resulted in a 3.7-fold increase of plasma triglyceride levels compared with control Ad-shGFP treatment (280 ± 46 versus 76 ± 26 mg/dl, respectively) (Fig. 4B). In the fasted mice, Ad-shJNK1 treatment resulted in no significant change in hepatic triglyceride levels, compared with control Ad-shGFP treatment (118 ± 35 versus 123 ± 31 mg/g, respectively). However, in ad libitum fed mice, Ad-shJNK1 treatment resulted in a significant increase in hepatic triglyceride levels compared with control Ad-shGFP treatment (95 ± 8 versus 51 ± 5 mg/g, respectively). Plasma free fatty acid levels were significantly elevated by 40% in JNK1 knockdown ad libitum fed mice compared with Ad-shGFP-treated mice (0.85 ± 0.2 versus 0.60 ± 0.18 mm). Plasma total cholesterol levels tended to be lower in Ad-shJNK1-treated ad libitum fed mice compared with Ad-shGFP-treated mice (117 ± 16 versus 141 ± 29 mg/dl, respectively), but this difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 4C). Plasma lipoprotein analysis by fast-protein liquid chromatography showed a robust 5-fold increase of triglyceride levels in the VLDL fraction of Ad-shJNK1-treated ad libitum fed mice compared with Ad-shGFP-treated mice (Fig. 4, D and E). Additionally, the Ad-shJNK1-treated mice had significantly increased cholesterol levels in the VLDL fraction and reduced cholesterol levels in LDL and HDL fractions compared with Ad-shGFP-treated mice (Fig. 4D). Similar lipoprotein changes were observed in 16-h fasted mice as a result of liver-specific JNK1 knockdown (data not shown). To investigate potential mechanisms for increased plasma triglyceride, we analyzed liver expression of several key genes involved in lipogenesis and lipoprotein secretion at day 5 after recombinant adenoviral treatment in the ad libitum fed mice. Compared with control Ad-shGFP treatment, real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that liver-specific knockdown of JNK1 resulted in a robust and significant 3.8-fold induction of PGC-1β expression (Fig. 5A). PGC-1α expression, in contrast, did not show significant changes as a result of JNK1 knockdown. In addition, expression of cytochrome c, a well known PGC-1 target gene, was significantly elevated by 2-fold in the same mice, supportive of increased PGC-1β activity in these animals (Fig. 5A). The mRNA level of the transcription factor SREBP1, a master regulator for hepatic lipogenesis, was modestly but not significantly reduced in the JNK1-knockdown mice (Fig. 5B). Western blot analysis demonstrated a significant 46% reduction of SREBP1 protein in JNK1-knockdown mice (Fig. 5C). Despite reduced expression of SREBP1, real-time PCR analysis showed unchanged expression of several SREBP1-target genes, including FAS, SCD1, ACC1, DGAT2, HMGCR, and LDLR in JNK1-knockdown mice (data not shown). In contrast, JNK1 knock"

ASIC1a has been implicated in long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission and ischemic brain injury, whereas ASIC2a is involved in mechanosensation. Although the biological role and distribution of ASIC1a and ASIC2a subunits in brain have been well characterized, little is known about the intracellular regulation of these ion channels that modulates their function. Using pulldown assays and mass spectrometry, we have identified A kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP)150 and the protein phosphatase calcineurin as binding proteins to ASIC2a. Extended pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that these regulatory proteins also interact with ASIC1a. Transfection of rat cortical neurons with constructs encoding green fluorescent protein- or hemagglutinin-tagged channels showed expression of ASIC1a and ASIC2a in punctate and clustering patterns in dendrites that co-localized with AKAP150. Inhibition of protein kinase A binding to AKAPs by Ht-31 peptide reduces ASIC currents in cortical neurons and Chinese hamster ovary cells, suggesting a role of AKAP150 in association with protein kinase A in ASIC function. We also demonstrated a regulatory function of calcineurin in ASIC1a and ASIC2a activity. Cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of calcineurin, increased ASIC currents in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in cortical neurons, suggesting that activity of ASICs is inhibited by calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation. These data imply that ASIC down-regulation by calcineurin could play an important role under pathological conditions accompanying intracellular Ca2+ overload and tissue acidosis to circumvent harmful activities mediated by these channels.

Although epithelial Na+ channels are constitutively active in kidney epithelia, ASICs are proton-gated ion channels that are activated in response to reduction in extracellular pH. In mammalian brain and sensory neurons, isoforms of ASICs and their splice variants (ASIC1a, ASIC1b, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, and ASIC3) form various functional ASICs that are composed of homo- or heteromultimeric subunits. Homomultimeric ASICs display different sensitivities in response to external acidification, and assemblies of heteromeric subunits have acid-responsive properties that are distinct from their parental homomultimeric ASICs (5Bassilana F.

ASIC2 knock-out mice have shown enhanced pH sensitivity and slow desensitization of proton-induced currents with almost no changes in current amplitude in hippocampal neurons, implying a modulatory role of ASIC2a in ASIC1a/ASIC2a heteromultimers in pH sensitivity and desensitization (20Askwith C.C.

ASICs share a common structural architecture with members of the epithelial Na+ channel/degenerin super family, which have two transmembrane domains with a large extracellular loop and two short intracellular N and C termini (for review, see Ref. 21Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). A number of regulatory proteins for ASICs have been identified. Protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1) is a synaptic protein with a PDZ domain and interacts with the C termini of both ASIC1a and ASIC2a, which mediates the regulation of these channels by protein kinase C (PKC) (22Duggan A.

Similar to the involvement of MEC-2 in mechanosensation in Caenorhabditis elegans, stomatin, the mammalian homolog of MEC-2, has been shown to interact with and modulate the activity of ASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC3 (25Price M.

These interacting proteins have been shown to influence the function of ASICs. Although PICK1 binding to ASIC1a is associated with phosphorylation and changes in the cellular localization of the channel (26Leonard A.S. Yermolaieva O. Hruska-Hageman A. Askwith C.C. Price M.P. Wemmie J.A. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Accordingly, we sought proteins that participate in regulation of brain-expressed ASICs by protein-protein interaction. Pulldown assays in combination with mass spectrometric analyses identified A kinase-anchoring protein 150 (AKAP150) and the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B, also called calcineurin, as proteins interacting with ASIC2a. These regulatory proteins also interacted with ASIC1a. AKAP150, the neuron specific rat ortholog of human AKAP79, is present in the postsynaptic density in association with cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), PKC, and calcineurin (27Colledge M.

These enzymes are associated with AKAP79/150 in inactive states, and the interaction with the anchoring protein has different consequences for the activity of these enzymes. In the case of PKA, only the regulatory subunit (RII) is anchored to AKAP and the catalytic (C) subunit, a serine/threonine kinase, interacts with RII forming active enzyme (29Klauck T.M. Faux M.C.

Disruption of the RII binding to AKAP150 by synthetic peptide Ht-31 decreased acid-evoked currents in mouse cortical neurons and Chinese hamster ovarian cancer (CHO) cells expressing homomeric ASIC1a or ASIC2a function, implying involvement of AKAP-anchored PKA in the function of ASIC1a and ASIC2a. Furthermore, inhibition of calcineurin by cyclosporin A significantly increased acid-evoked current in neuronal cells as well as in CHO cells. Taken together, our results suggest that both AKAP150 and calcineurin are involved in regulation of ASIC1a and ASIC2a, possibly by changing the phosphorylation status of these channels. Plasmid Constructs and Purification of Fusion Proteins—The rat cDNA clone of ASIC1a (GI: 13162348) was a gift from Dr. E. W. McCleskey (Vollum Institute, Oregon Health and Science University) and Dr. M. J. Welsh (Department of Internal Medicine and Physiology and Biophysics and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Iowa), and ASIC2a (GI: 1280440) was from Dr. M. Lazdunski (Institut de Pharmacologie Molecularire et Celluaire, CNRS-UNSA, Institut Paul Hamel). The GST fusion to cDNA clone of AKAP150 (pGEX::GST-AKAP150) was a gift from Dr. J. D. Scott (Vollum Institute and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Oregon Health and Science University). From this clone the cDNA encoding AKAP150 was amplified by the PCR method and inserted into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), resulting in pCDNA-AKAP150. For GST fusion proteins of ASIC1a and ASIC2a, the coding regions of the intracellular N and C terminus were PCR-amplified from the original cDNA clones and subcloned into the plasmid pGEX-6P-3 (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting fusion proteins were designated as GST-ASIC1aN (44 amino acids from the N terminus), GST-ASIC1aC (74 amino acids from the C terminus) GST-ASIC1aE (68 amino acids from Asn-119 to Val-186), GST-ASIC2aN (41 amino acids from the N terminus), and GST-ASIC2aC (59 amino acids from the C terminus). The N-terminal fusion of YFP to ASIC1a and ASIC2a was constructed using the plasmid pCDNA6.2-N-YFP (Invitrogen), resulting pCDNA6.2-YFP-ASIC1a and pCDNA6.2-YFP-ASIC2a. For the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tagging in the extracellular domain of ASIC1a, the nucleotide sequence encoding HA (YPYDVPDYA) was incorporated into the oligonucleotide primer sequence that was used to amplify the first 690-base pair fragment from the 5′-end, allowing the HA insertion at position 230 amino acid. The 891-base pair fragment of the ASIC1a from the 3′-end was also PCR-amplified and subcloned together with the 5′ fragment into the plasmid pCDNA3.1, resulting in full-length ASIC1a (pCDNA-ASIC1a-eHA). The HA epitope was inserted at the C terminus of the ASIC2a using PCR methods, which was then subcloned into the plasmid pCDNA3.1 (pCDNA-ASIC2a-cHA). The GFP fusion constructs of ASIC1a and ASIC2a were carried out using the plasmid pCDNAJM1-EGFP (a gift from Dr. A. Merz, Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington), allowing GFP fusion at the C terminus of ASIC1a (pCDNA-ASIC1a-EGFP) and ASIC2a (pCDNA-ASIC2a-EGFP). The overexpression and purification of the GST fusion proteins were carried out as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified from the bacterial lysates using GS-4B beads (supplemental Fig. S1). Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO cells and HEK293 were cultured in F-12K medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% FBS in humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cortical neurons from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat and neonatal E16 Swiss mice were cultured in neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27 and GlutaMax (Invitrogen). Neurons were cultured for 5 days before immunocytochemistry and 12 days before electrophysiological recordings. Transient transfection of neurons, CHO cells, and HEK293 cells was carried out using FuGENE 6 lipid-based transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). For electrophysiological recordings, CHO cells were transfected with pCDNA-ASIC1a-GFP or pCDNA-ASIC2a-GFP for 48 h and then re-plated in 35-mm dishes at a lower cell density. After incubation overnight, GFP-positive cells were selected for the measurement of ASIC currents. Immunocytochemistry—After transfection with pCDNA-ASIC1a-GFP and pCDNA-ASIC2a-HA, neuronal cells were washed 3 times in PBS, fixed in 10% formalin, PBS, washed three times in PBS, and permeabilized with 3% Triton X-100/PBS. For immunochemical staining with anti-AKAP150 antibody alone, cells were incubated first in blocking buffer containing 2% donkey serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. For double detection with anti-AKAP150 and anti-HA antibody, blocking buffer containing 2% donkey serum, 2% goat serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS was used. Cells were then incubated with goat anti-AKAP 150 C-20 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with or without rabbit anti-HA probe (Y-11) IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After extensive wash, cells were incubated for 2 h with donkey anti-goat IgG-Cy3 (Jackson Immuno Research) and/or goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson Immuno Research). Both primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in the appropriate blocking buffer. After extensive washing, coverslips were mounted on glass slides. Images were collected with an epifluorescence microscope (Leica DM LB) in 40× objective/10× ocular. HEK293 cells expressing AKAP150 together with GFP, YFP-ASIC1a, or YFP-ASIC2a were immunolabeled with anti-AKAP150 antibody as described above. YFP-ASICs were visualized using a primary antibody that detects both GFP wild type and its variants (BD Living colors A.v. monoclonal antibody JL-8, Clontech) and goat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate. Pulldown Assays—For mass spectrometric analyses, ∼0.5 mg of purified GST fusion proteins bound to GS-4B beads were used to incubate with lysate from one rat brain. Rat brain lysate was prepared by Dounce homogenization in 10 ml of HEN buffer (50 mm HEPES, 10 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and subsequently diluted with 10 ml of HEN buffer containing 2% Triton X-100. After incubation at 4 °C with rotation, insoluble material was separated from the lysate by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 × g. To preclear, supernatant was incubated with 0.5 ml of GS-4B beads at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 × g. The GST fusion proteins bound to GS-4B were added to the supernatant and incubated for 2 h at 4°C with shaking. The complexes of bead-protein(s) were washed 6 times with PBS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and finally resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and stored at -20 °C. In smaller scale pulldown experiments, the same procedure was applied as described above, except only half-amount of all the reagents were used. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—HEK293 cells were co-transfected with pCDNA-AKAP150 and pCDNA-GFP, pCDNA-AKAP150 and pCDNA6.2-YFP-ASIC1a, or pCDNA-AKAP150 and pCDNA6.2-YFP-ASIC2a in 6-well plates. After 24 h of transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in 300 μl of ice-cold HEN buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The insoluble material including nuclei (pellet) was removed by centrifugation at 760 × g for 10 min, and supernatant was precleared with 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and 1 μg of anti-cascade blue antibody (Molecular Probes) at 4 °C. Beads and antibody were removed from the lysate by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. For co-immunoprecipitation, lysates were first incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of affinity-purified anti-GFP antibody and then with 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose for an additional 3 h. After centrifugation at 760 × g for 5 min, the pellet containing beads bound to antibody-protein(s) complex was washed 5 times with HEN buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer for Western blot analysis. Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry—Bead-bound protein samples from pulldown assays were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. One whole lane was cut in 5 gel slices. As described previously (35Farr C. Grafken P.R. Norbeck A.D. Doneanu C.E. Stapels M.D. Barofsky D.F. Minami M. Saugstad J.A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 438-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the trypsin digestion of the protein samples in the gel slices and liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectroscopy were carried out by Proteomics facility, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle, WA). Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples from pulldown assays and co-immunoprecipitation assays were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% milk (blocking buffer) and probed with primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 2 h. After an extensive wash in PBS, membranes were probed with appropriate secondary antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugates, donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), and goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase bound to immunoblot was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and Eastman Kodak BioMax Chemiluminescence film. Electrophysiology—ASIC currents were recorded with the conventional whole-cell patch clamp technique at room temperature (20-22 °C). In general, cells were voltage-clamped at holding potentials of -60 mV. Data were acquired using an AXOPATCH 200B amplifier with pCLAMP 8.2 software (Axon Instruments, CA). Data were filtered at 2 KHz and digitized at 5 Hz using Digidata 1322A (Axon Instruments). For rapid changes of extracellular solutions, a multibarrel perfusion system (SF-77, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) was used. Low pH extracellular solutions were applied at 2-min intervals to allow for complete recovery of ASICs from desensitization. The neutral extracellular solutions contained 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, 320-335 mOsm. In the extracellular solutions with pH ≤ 6.0, 20 mm HEPES was replaced by 10 mm MES for more reliable pH buffering. The pH of the extracellular solution was adjusted with NaOH/HCl. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (1.5-mm diameter; WPI, Sarasota, FL) on a two-stage puller (PP83, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). Pipettes had a resistance of 2-4 megaohms when filled with the intracellular solution, which contained 140 mm CsF, 2 mm triethylammonium chloride, 11 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2 in pH 7.3 adjusted with CsOH/HCl, 290-300 mOsm. Cyclosporin A (Fluka) and FK-506 (LC laboratories) were first dissolved in 100% ethanol to make a 10 mm stock solution and diluted to the final concentration of 30 μm and 10 μm in the pipette solution, respectively. The AKAP inhibitor peptide Ht-31 and Ht-31P (Promega) were dissolved in water to make a 10 mm stock solution and then diluted to the final concentration of 20 μm in the pipette solution. To ensure high quality voltage-clamp, only the recordings with an access resistance of less than 10 megaohms and a leak current less than 100 pA at -60 mV were included for analysis. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using two-way ANOVA and Student t test where appropriate. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Identification of AKAP150 and Calcineurin B as Binding Partners with ASIC2a N Terminus—Like the other members of the degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel superfamily, N and C termini of ASIC2a are the only cytoplasmic domains of this channel (36Renard S.

We questioned whether the N terminus of these channels is also involved in the regulation of function or surface expression. To identify potential regulatory proteins in brain, we first used in vitro protein-protein binding assays using the N terminus (41 amino acids) of ASIC2a fused to GST protein (GST-ASIC2aN). The fusion protein was affinity-purified using GS-4B beads from bacterial lysate and mixed with rat brain lysate to pull down any interacting proteins. The bead-protein complexes were purified and separated by one-dimensional SDS-gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A). In parallel, a control experiment was performed with GST protein bound to GS-4B to identify nonspecific interaction. Both samples were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry, and identified proteins were searched in the rat protein data base of international protein index. Of particular interest were a peptide fragment from AKAP150 and one peptide fragment from A subunit isoform α of protein phosphatase 2B (also called calcineurin). The identified peptides of AKAP150 and calcineurin A subunit were nine amino acids long (TPGSEKEAK) and 33 amino acids long (VTEMLVNVLNICSDDELGSEEDGFDGATAAARK), respectively.

It was proposed that one function of the R-domain, which extends along the outer membrane surface, is to recruit an additional outer membrane protein(s) to form a translocon for passage colicin activity domain. A 3.5-Å crystal structure of the complex of E2R135 and BtuB (E2R135-BtuB) was obtained, which revealed E2R135 bound to BtuB in an oblique orientation identical to that previously found for E3R135. The only significant difference between the two structures was that the bound coiled-coil R-domain of colicin E2, compared with that of colicin E3, was extended by two and five residues at the N and C termini, respectively. There was no detectable displacement of the BtuB plug domain in either structure, implying that colicin is not imported through the outer membrane by BtuB alone. It was concluded that the oblique orientation of the R-domain of the nuclease E colicins has a function in the recruitment of another member(s) of an outer membrane translocon. Screening of porin knock-out mutants showed that either OmpF or OmpC can function in such a translocon.

Protein transport across membranes in organelles and bacteria is known to involve multiprotein complexes (1Mokranjac D. Neupert W. Biochem. Soc.

Colicin import across the outer membrane of Escherichia coli has also been inferred to involve such a translocon (3Lazdunski C.J. Mol.

An experimentally useful attribute of colicin uptake for studies on protein transport across membranes is that the end result is cytotoxicity. Colicins are plasmid-encoded bactericidal proteins that are released in response to stress, enter the bacterial cell by appropriating its outer membrane nutrient-uptake machinery, and provide an advantage to colicin-resistant cells in the competition for nutrition (9Riley M.A. Gordon D.M. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 129-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Colicins are produced in complex with a small immunity (∼10 kDa) protein that binds to, and prevents, the colicin from killing the producing cell (10Bowman C.M. Sidikaro J. Nomura M. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 234: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 11Jakes K.S. Zinder N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3380-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Nuclease colicins consist of three domains: an N-terminal T (translocation)-domain that functions in the import of the colicin across the outer membrane, a C-terminal C (catalysis or channel)domain that contains the cytotoxic activity, and a central R (receptor-binding)-domain that functions in irreversible attachment to an outer membrane receptor. Colicins have been divided into two groups, A and B, based on the intracellular protein translocation network that is utilized. “Group A” colicins utilize the Tol proteins TolA, TolB, TolQ, TolR, and Pal (4Lazzaroni J.C. Dubuisson J.F. Vianney A. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Davies J.K. Reeves P. J.

Bacteriol. 1967; 94: 1112-1123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas “Group B” colicins utilize the Ton proteins, TonB, ExbB, and ExbD (5Braun V. Patzer S.I. Hantke K. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 365-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 14Davies J.K. Reeves P. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 96-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to enter the bacterial cytoplasmic compartment and/or insert into the cytoplasmic membrane. Colicins E2 (a DNase) and E3 (a 16 S rRNase), both nuclease E colicins and members of Group A, utilize the same outer membrane receptor, BtuB, to bind to and enter the cell. BtuB, a 22-stranded antiparallel β-barrel integral outer membrane protein, functions physiologically to transport cobalamin (vitamin B12) across the outer membrane (15Chimento D.P. Kadner R.J. Wiener M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 999-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The interaction of nuclease E colicins with BtuB is neither TonB-nor energy-dependent. The central pore of the BtuB-barrel is occluded by an N-terminal 132-residue “plug” domain, which, in the absence of an energy input, would prevent the passage of any colicin. The crystal structure of a complex of the R-domain (E3R135) 4The abbreviations used are: E2R135 and E3R135, 135-residue receptor-binding domain of colicins E2 and E3, respectively; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; LDAO, N,N-dimethyl-dodecylamine-N-oxide; OMP, outer membrane protein. of colicin E3 in complex with BtuB, solved to a resolution of 2.75 Å, provides several clues to the mechanism of colicin import through the outer membrane (7Kurisu G.

At least one additional embedded outer membrane protein participates in an outer membrane translocon for colicin import through the outer membrane. It was hypothesized that the unusual elongate receptor-binding domain, with a length of ∼100 Å for rRNase colicin E3 (17Soelaiman S. Jakes K. Wu N. Li C. Shoham M. Mol.

Nuclease E colicins have highly conserved T- and R-domains, with the major difference in their amino acid sequences residing in their C-domains and at the junction of the R- and C-domain, suggesting that they utilize a common pathway for entry into the bacterial cell. A question was posed as to whether the structure of the E3R135-BtuB complex could be applied to other nuclease E colicins. Alignment of the R-domain of colicin E3 and E2 revealed a difference of 12 of 135 residues, with all of the mismatches concentrated in the C terminus of the R-domain (Fig. 1). The structure of the E2R135-BtuB complex, obtained in the present study at a resolution of 3.5 Å, was found to be virtually identical to the corresponding structure of the E3R135-BtuB complex solved previously (7Kurisu G. Zakharov S.D. Zhalnina M.V. Bano S. Eroukova V.Y. Rokitskaya T.I. Antonenko Y.N. Wiener M.C. Cramer W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Studies that bear on the import mechanism show that, under normal growth conditions, among the tested porins only OmpF or OmpC is necessary for colicin cytotoxicity and that the site of protease cleavage of the imported colicin E2 is similar or identical to that studied previously in colicin E7 (30Shi Z. Chak K.F. Yuan H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24663-24668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Bacterial Strains—The E. coli XL1 Blue strain was used as the host strain for cloning of E2R135. Cloning was done in the pET41b vector such that there was a His8 tag at the C terminus of the protein. E. coli BL21(DE3) was the host strain for expressing the protein. In the pET41b vector, protein expression is under the control of a strong isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible T7 RNA polymerase promoter. All cultures were grown in LB media or on LB agar plates supplemented with antibiotic when required. Purification of E2R135—The E2R135 construct was created by cloning residues Thr313–Asp447,a 135-residue-long peptide, in the expression vector pET41b. The cloning was done using standard protocols. E2R135 was first amplified using upstream (Nde primer) and downstream (Xho primer) primers and then cloned between the NdeI-XhoI sites of pET41b in such a way that there was a His8 tag at the C terminus joined by a linker consisting of residues Lys and Glu, bringing the total length of the peptide to 145 residues. Purification of the over-expressed E2R135 construct was accomplished using a nickel-charged IDA-agarose column. Purification of BtuB—BtuB was expressed in strain TNE012 (pJC3) and purified using a previously published protocol (31Taylor R. Burgner J.W. Clifton J. Cramer W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31113-31118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). BtuB was extracted from the outer membrane with 1.5% (w/v) β-d-octyl-glucoside, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (PMSF/TPCK), pH 8.0, and purified by ion-exchange chromatography in 0.1% (w/v) LDAO using a 0–0.8 m LiCl gradient in a DEAE fast protein liquid chromatography column. BtuB-enriched fractions were concentrated and further purified on a Superdex 200HR size exclusion column in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) LDAO, pH 8.0. BtuB concentrations were determined from its UV extinction coefficient: [ɛ (280 nm) = 137 cm–1mm–1]. Knock-out Strains—Strains having single, double, and triple porin knock-outs were used to study the role of these porins in the colicin import. Knock-out strains were produced by using a previously published method (32Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97 (– 6645): 6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). PCR primers were used to provide homology to the targeted gene(s). The chromosomal sequence was replaced with a kanamycin resistance gene generated by PCR by using primers with 36-nucleotide homology extensions. This is accomplished by Red-mediated recombination in these flanking homologies. The Red helper plasmid, a temperature sensitive replicon, was cured by growth at 37 °C (32Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97 (– 6645): 6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity Assays—190 μl of LB broth with or without 1 nm colicin E3 was inoculated with 10 μl of overnight cultures of porin knock-out strains in a 96-well plate. The cells were allowed to grow over a period of 5 h, and growth was monitored by measuring optical density at 410 nm at 30-min intervals. The cytotoxicity of wild type E2 and E2 R452A was assayed using a “spot test.” Spot tests involve plating colicin-sensitive pT7-7 cells (Ampr cells) onto a LB Amp plate to which different concentrations of colicin are applied in 20-μl drops. Lysis of the bacterial cells is seen as clear spots in a lawn of bacteria. The lowest inhibitory concentration was defined as the smallest concentration that would generate a clear zone of inhibition. Crystallization—Crystallization screening was done in a 96-well plate utilizing a Genomic Solutions robot. E2R135 and BtuB were mixed at a ratio of 1.6:1 (mol:mol) and allowed to react for ∼30 min. The protein was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1% LDAO buffer. The reservoir solution contained 10% dioxane, 0.1 m MES, and 1.6 m ammonium sulfate. Crystals of the E2R135-BtuB complex were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion, mixing 0.7 μlofthe protein solution with 0.7 μl of reservoir buffer at 20 °C. Crystals grew within 1 week. Structure Determination and Refinement—X-ray diffraction data at 3.5-Å resolution were collected at 100 K at the SBC 19-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. Data reduction and scaling were processed using the program HKL2000 (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Method Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121, with a = 76.2 Å, b = 80.7 Å, c = 235.9 Å. The unit cell of the E2R135-BtuB crystal was similar to that of E3R135-BtuB (a = 76.9 Å, b = 80.1 Å, c = 233.6 Å; Protein Data Bank accession code 1UJW). The structure was determined by rigid body refinement with the program REFMAC5 in CCP4 (34Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab Occlusion of OmpF—The occlusion by colicin E2 of OmpF channels incorporated into planar bilayers was studied as described previously (16Zakharov S.D. Eroukova V.Y. Rokitskaya T.I. Zhalnina M.V. Sharma O. Loll P.J. Zgurskaya H.I. Antonenko Y.N. Cramer W.A. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3901-3911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The synthetic phospholipids DOPC and DOPE were mixed in a 1:1 molar (total concentration, 10 mg/ml) ratio, dissolved in n-decane, and then used to form planar bilayers (39Benz R. Schmid A. Hancock R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 722-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Song J. Minetti C.A. Blake M.S. Colombini M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1370: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Bilayers were formed by painting lipids using a “brush technique” (41Mueller P. Rudin D.O. Tien H.T. Wescott W.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 979-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) on a 0.2-mm aperture in a partition separating two 4-ml chambers containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.1 m KCl, 23 °C. Occlusion was studied by measuring the current across this aperture with Ag/AgCl electrodes immersed into the two chambers, using a Warner BC-525C amplifier (Hamden, CT). To form channels, OmpF (1 pg/ml-1 ng/ml) was added to the cis-side of the membrane, and the solution was stirred until channels appeared. A negative transmembrane potential was applied to the cis-side, with the trans-side at electrical ground. Colicin (0.5–1 μg) was added to the trans-side of the aperture. Structure of the E2R135-BtuB Complex—Crystals of the E2R135-BtuB complex diffracted to 3.5 Å. The structure was solved as described under “Materials and Methods” using the E3R135-BtuB structure as a reference (Protein Data Bank code 1UJW). The structure reveals 123 residues of E2R135 (residues 321–443), in a coiled-coil conformation, bound to BtuB (Fig. 2A). A total of 12 residues distal to the BtuB binding site, eight N-terminal and four C-terminal, are disordered and not resolved in the structure. This extent of disorder differs slightly from the total of 19 residues (10 N-terminal and 9 C-terminal) of E3R135 that are disordered in the E3R135-BtuB structure. Otherwise, the crystal structure of E2R135-BtuB is very similar to that of E3R135-BtuB (Fig. 2B (7Kurisu G. Zakharov S.D. Zhalnina M.V. Bano S. Eroukova V.Y. Rokitskaya T.I. Antonenko Y.N. Wiener M.C. Cramer W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)). In a recently published structure of Cir and the receptor-binding domain of colicin Ia, a single C-terminal residue is disordered and not resolved (42Buchanan S.K. Lukacik P. Grizot S. Ghirlando R. Ali M.M. Barnard T.J. Jakes K.S. Kienker P.K. Esser L. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2594-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The BtuB-R135 interaction surface, defined by a 4.5-Å van der Waals distance of closest approach, is similar for the E2 and E3 structures: (i) in all, 28 residues of E2R135 (and E3R135) interact with 29 residues of BtuB; (ii) Met383 and Pro382, respectively, of E2R135 and E3R135 are in contact with six residues of the plug domain (Thr55, Gln56, Asn57, Leu63, Ser64, and Ser65); (iii) for both colicins, the buried area of E2R135 is 1262 Å2, whereas the corresponding figure for E3R135 is 1287 Å2; (iv) the principle axis of the R-peptide resides at an identical angle of ∼44° relative to the membrane surface for both colicins; (v) the number of hydrogen bonds between the plug and the barrel of BtuB is 61, 56, and 65 for E2R135-BtuB, E3R135-BtuB, and apo-BtuB crystallized in surfo (Protein Data Bank code 1NQE) structure, respectively; (vi) the accessible surface area of the plug domain is also essentially identical, as the area for the apo-BtuB (1NQE), for E2R135-BtuB (2YSU) and E3R135-BtuB (1UJW) is 2768, 2900, and 2904 Å2, respectively (the above calculation includes the surface area of the BtuB plug domain/R-domain interface for the E2R135-BtuB and E3R135-BtuB structures); (vii) R-domain residues involved in crystal contacts (Leu330, Asn331, Asn334, Ala338, Gln341, Gln342, Ala345, Arg432, and Glu436 of E2R135) are identical in the case of both structures; (viii) all of the crystal contacts of the R-domain for both the E2- and E3R135 complexes are contained in extracellular loops 5–6 and 7–8 of BtuB. It is inferred that the entry of the colicin does not occur through the pore of BtuB because; (i) there is no detectable distortion of the plug domain in the E2R135 and E3R135 structures relative to that of apo-BtuB (Fig. 2C); (ii) no ionic current (>1.0 × 10–12 A) was induced by the addition of colicin E3 to BtuB incorporated into planar bilayers (16Zakharov S.D. Eroukova V.Y. Rokitskaya T.I. Zhalnina M.V. Sharma O. Loll P.J. Zgurskaya H.I. Antonenko Y.N. Cramer W.A. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3901-3911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As was the case for E3R135-BtuB, binding of E2R135 affects the loops of BtuB in the E2R135-BtuB structure when compared with both the in surfo (Fig. 2D) (15Chimento D.P. Kadner R.J. Wiener M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 999-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and in meso (Fig. 3) structures of apo-BtuB (43Cherezov V. Yamashita E. Liu W. Zhalnina M. Cramer W.A. Caffrey M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 716-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Loops 5–6 and 7–8, which are disordered in the in surfo apo-BtuB structure, are ordered in the E2R135-BtuB structure (Fig. 2D). This can be compared with the Cir-colicin Ia structure in which there is a large outward movement of loops 7 and 8 (42Buchanan S.K. Lukacik P. Grizot S. Ghirlando R. Ali M.M. Barnard T.J. Jakes K.S. Kienker P.K. Esser L. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2594-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In E2R135-BtuB there is a change in the position of loop 19–20, and the location of the partial order in loop 3–4 is altered. When compared with the in meso BtuB structure, the disordered loops 5–6 and 21–22 become ordered upon binding of E2R135 (Fig. 3). There is also a difference in the position of the loops 9–10, 13–14, 15–16, and 19–20, and the location of the partial order in loop3–4 is altered. In addition, unlike the Cir-Ia complex structure (42Buchanan S.K. Lukacik P. Grizot S. Ghirlando R. Ali M.M. Barnard T.J. Jakes K.S. Kienker P.K. Esser L. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2594-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), where the binding of the R-domain of colicin Ia does not elicit a change in the N-terminal tonB box, binding of the R-domain of both colicins E2 and E3 causes ordering of residues Ser4 and Pro5 in the tonB box on the periplasmic side of BtuB. There are some differences between the R-domain of the two structures, with most of these differences located at the termini of the coiled-coil. The major difference is that the E2R135 structure is longer by two residues at the N terminus and by five residues at the C terminus. Also, compared with the corresponding residues of E3R135-BtuB structure (7Kurisu G. Zakharov S.D. Zhalnina M.V. Bano S. Eroukova V.Y. Rokitskaya T.I. Antonenko Y.N. Wiener M.C. Cramer W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the C-α positions of the N-terminal seven residues 323–329 of E2R135 show a gradual increase in displacement as a function of increasing distance from BtuB along the coiled-coil, with the N-terminal residue, Tyr323, having a maximum displacement of 5.2 Å. Occlusion of OmpF Channels by E2—OmpF channels incorporated into planar bilayer membranes were occluded by colicin E2 (4 μg/ml) added to the trans-side in the presence of a cis-negative potential (data not shown) in a manner similar to the occlusion by colicin E3 (7Kurisu G. Zakharov S.D. Zhalnina M.V. Bano S. Eroukova V.Y. Rokitskaya T.I. Antonenko Y.N. Wiener M.C. Cramer W.A. Nat. Struct.

In Vivo Cytotoxicity Assays—A library of indicator knock-out strains each missing one or more porins (44Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006. 2006; 2: 0008Google Scholar) was tested for colicin sensitivity. No single porin knockout was resistant to colicin E3 (Fig. 4A). However, the ΔOmpR strain, in which the OmpF and OmpC positive regulator is knocked out and thus is missing both OmpF and OmpC, was resistant to E3 (Fig. 4B). This implies that either OmpF or OmpC, but no other OMP, can function in the translocon for the nuclease"

However, the precise roles of 14-3-3σ during tumorigenesis are not well characterized. Here, we show that 14-3-3σ is a critical regulator of murine double minute oncogene (MDM2). 14-3-3σ interacts with MDM2 at the RING domain. The C-terminal region of 14-3-3σ binds to MDM2 very efficiently. Importantly, 14-3-3σ overexpression leads to destabilization of MDM2 through enhancing MDM2 self-ubiquitination and accelerating turnover rate. Conversely, loss of 14-3-3σ results in a significant increase in MDM2 protein. Moreover, live-cell images indicated that 14-3-3σ can affect the location of MDM2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and that MDM2-mediated cytoplasmic localization of p53 can be reversed by the presence of 14-3-3σ. Significantly, we further showed that 14-3-3σ causes MDM2 downregulation, thereby stabilizing p53 and inhibiting tumor growth in animal tumors. Also, 14-3-3σ blocks MDM2-mediated retinoblastoma degradation and p53 NEDDylation. Our results provide evidence that 14-3-3σ is a pivotal MDM2 regulator involved in blocking a variety of activities of MDM2."
https://openalex.org/W2043650993,"Mechanisms controlling the survival of neural precursor cells (NPCs) are critical during brain development, in adults for neuron replenishment, and after transplantation for neuron replacement. This investigation found that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) promotes apoptotic signaling in cultured NPCs derived from embryonic mouse brain subjected to two common apoptotic conditions, trophic factor withdrawal and genotoxic stress. Trophic factor withdrawal activated GSK3 and the key apoptosis mediators Bax and caspase-3. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 activity produced dramatic reductions in the activation of Bax and caspase-3 and NPC death after trophic factor withdrawal. Trophic factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis was delayed in Bax knock-out NPCs, but GSK3 inhibitors provided additional protection. Genotoxic stress induced by camptothecin treatment of NPCs stabilized p53, which formed a complex with GSK3β and activated Bax and caspase-3. Camptothecin-induced activation of caspase-3 was reduced by GSK3 inhibitors in both bax+/+ and bax-/- NPCs. Thus, NPCs are sensitive to loss of trophic factors and genotoxic stress, and inhibitors of GSK3 are capable of enhancing NPC survival.

Increased neurogenesis can theoretically be accomplished by increasing NPC proliferation, differentiation, or survival. The latter is a particularly attractive site for intervention because before maturing to functional neurons a significant portion of NPCs is lost due to death by apoptosis, although the precise percentage that dies remains uncertain (12Blaschke A.J.

An important regulator of apoptosis is glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) (18Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). In addition to facilitating apoptosis induced by many insults, GSK3 is further an attractive potential target for reducing apoptosis because it is inhibited by lithium (22Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 23Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr.

Psychiatry. 1999; 4: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Lithium directly inhibits GSK3 (22Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar) and also promotes inhibitory phosphorylation on serine-9 and serine-21 of the two isoforms of GSK3, GSK3β and GSK3α, respectively (25Jope R.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 441-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), a modulation that is often catalyzed by Akt (26Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several structurally diverse inhibitors of GSK3 have recently been developed (27Martinez A. Castro A. Medina A. Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK-3) and Its Inhibitors. 2006; (, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Hoboken, NJ)Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), providing an armory of tools available to inhibit GSK3. Because many NPCs may be lost to apoptosis, GSK3 promotes apoptosis, and GSK3 inhibitors are available to block GSK3-facilitated apoptosis, GSK3 may be a favorable target for bolstering neurogenesis. To investigate this possibility with apoptotic conditions that NPCs may encounter either during development or with cytotoxic stresses, we exposed NPCs to trophic factor withdrawal or to the DNA damaging agent camptothecin. The results demonstrate that NPCs die by apoptosis involving Bax and caspase-3 activation after trophic factor withdrawal or DNA damage, and GSK3 inhibitors attenuate apoptotic signaling in NPCs exposed to each of these conditions. Cell Culture and Treatments—NPCs were prepared at gestational day 12-13 from the telencephalons of C57BL/6 mice (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD) or knock-out bax-/- mice and matched controls (28D'Sa-Eipper C.

Cells were dissociated for 18 min at 37 °C in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) containing 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA, 0.001% DNase I, and 0.2% BSA (Sigma). After treatment with trypsin, an equal volume of Hanks’ balanced salt solution with 10% fetal bovine serum was added, and cells were further dissociated by trituration four times. Cells were washed and resuspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 20 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2; Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ), 8 μg/ml heparin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 100 μg/ml apotransferrin, 30 nm sodium selenite, 20 nm progesterone, 100 μm putrescine, 6 g/liter glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 94.4 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), pH 7.4. NPCs were expanded as neurospheres, and experimental procedures were carried out with monolayers of NPCs. To prepare monolayers, the neurospheres were resuspended and incubated for 2 min at 37 °C in Hanks’ balanced salt solution with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA, 0.2% BSA, diluted with 2 volumes of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum, and plated on poly-l-lysine/laminin-coated culture plates and grown as monolayers for ∼24 h. Trophic factor withdrawal was established by placing NPCs in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 media without any additions. DNA damage was induced by treating cells with 10 μm camptothecin (Sigma) in NPC growth factor-containing media with FGF2. Where indicated, cells were treated with the selective GSK3 inhibitors 20 mm lithium, 5 μm kenpaullone (Sigma), 5 μm 2-thio(3-iodobenzyl)-5-(1-pyridyl)-[1,3,4]-oxadiazole (marketed as GSK3 Inhibitor II; Calbiochem), 20 μm indirubin-3′-monoxime (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), or 5 μm SB216763 (Tocris Cookson Inc., Ballwin, MO). Immunoblot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—For immunoblotting, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 nm okadaic acid, and 1% Triton-X-100). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed using sheep anti-mouse IgG Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway). The Dynabeads, 10 μl of slurry per sample, were washed twice in PBS, 0.1% BSA using a magnetic particle separator. The beads were incubated with 1 μg of anti-GSK3β antibody overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation followed by incubation with protein samples for 1 h at 4 °C, and the immune complexes were washed 3 times. Samples were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer (2% SDS) and placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Proteins were resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with primary antibodies to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), proteolyzed PARP 85-kDa fragment (1:1000; dilution; Pharmingen/Transduction Laboratories), total GSK3α/β (1:2000), phospho-Ser-9-GSK3β (1:1000), phospho-Ser21-GSK3α (1:1000), GSK3β (1:2000), total Akt (1:1000), phospho-Thr-308-Akt (1:1000), phospho-Ser-473-Akt (1:1000), Bak (1:1000), Bcl-XL (1:1000), BAX (1:1000), or cleaved, active casapse-3 (1:500; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Immunoblots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG followed by detection with enhanced chemiluminescence, and the protein bands were quantitated with a densitometer. Quantitative measurements from at least three independent experiments were tested for statistical significance using analysis of variance. Immunocytochemistry—NPCs cultured on poly-l-lysine/laminin-coated glass coverslips were treated as described under “Results.” Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized and blocked in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 3% BSA. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 3% BSA, including mouse anti-nestin (1:40,000; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, Iowa), mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (1:10,000; Chemicon), mouse anti-β-tubulin isotype III (1:10,000; Sigma), rabbit anti-activate caspase-3 (1:50; Cell Signaling), or mouse anti-active Bax (1:1000; Pharmingen/Transduction Laboratories), a conformational-specific Bax antibody that recognizes an epitope on Bax that is internalized in non-activated Bax but is externalized after apoptosis signaling-induced activation of Bax (30Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The primary antibody was removed, the cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with either tyramide signal amplification (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with cyanine 3-tyramide-conjugated or with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were labeled with 1 μg/ml bisbenzimide (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. NPCs were then washed three times with PBS, and coverslips were adhered to glass slides in mounting medium (0.1% p-phenylenediamine in 75% glycerol in PBS). Cells were viewed and photographed with an inverted Nikon fluorescence microscope. Positively stained cells were counted in at least 12 fields from a minimum of 3 different NPC preparations, and the total number of cells counted was always greater than 5000. Quantitative measurements from at least three independent experiments were tested for statistical significance using analysis of variance. Cell Viability—Chromatin condensation was determined by fluorescence microscopy after nuclear staining with Hoechst dye. Dead cells were quantified by propidium iodide staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. For this, after treatments NPCs were trypsinized, fixed in ethanol at -20 °C for 10 min, and rehydrated by adding PBS at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were stained with 3 μm propidium iodide in staining buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 15 min at room temperature and analyzed on a single-laser flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Quantitative measurements from at least three independent experiments were tested for statistical significance using analysis of variance except for the data in supplemental Fig. 2b where Student’s t test was used to determine statistical significance. Characterization of NPCs and Trophic Factor Withdrawal-induced Apoptosis—Isolated NPCs were expanded as neurospheres and then plated as monolayers (supplemental Fig. 1) for experimental manipulations, as previously described (31D'Sa C. Klocke B.J. Cecconi F. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Flavell R.A. Roth K.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Monolayers of NPCs were predominantly nestin-positive (>99%; a marker of NPCs) and less than 1% of cells were glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive (a marker of astrocytes), and no cells stained with the neuronal marker β-tubulin III (supplemental Fig. 1). Trophic factor withdrawal caused NPCs to undergo time-dependent activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate PARP beginning ∼3 h after trophic factor withdrawal (Fig. 1a). Immunocytochemistry verified the widespread activation of caspase-3 in NPCs 6 h after trophic factor withdrawal (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, morphological changes characteristic of apoptotic cells also were observed, such as chromatin condensation evident in Hoechst-stained NPCs 6 h after trophic factor withdrawal (Fig. 1c). Trophic Factor Withdrawal Induces Dephosphorylation of Akt and GSK3—Growth factors often maintain cell viability in part by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway (26Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When activated, Akt is phosphorylated on Ser-473 and Thr-308, and Akt catalyzes phosphorylation of GSK3 on a regulatory serine which inhibits its activity (26Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Woodgett J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined if this pathway was inactivated after trophic factor withdrawal by using phospho-dependent antibodies to detect phosphorylation of the regulatory sites on Akt and GSK3 in immunoblot analyses. Trophic factor withdrawal caused a rapid dephosphorylation of Akt on both Ser-473 and Thr-308, whereas the total level of Akt remained unchanged (Fig. 2a). Concomitant with the dephosphorylation of Akt, there was loss of serine phosphorylation of the two isoforms of GSK3, phospho-Ser-21-GSK3α and phospho-Ser-9-GSK3β, whereas the total protein levels of GSK3α/β were unchanged after trophic factor withdrawal (Fig. 2b). Quantitative analyses of these changes suggests that Akt is likely an important kinase for phosphorylating these serines in GSK3 in NPCs since there was concomitant dephosphorylation of Akt and GSK3 but also that other kinases contribute to serine phosphorylation of GSK3 since the dephosphorylation of serine-phosphorylated GSK3 was not as complete as was the dephosphorylation of Akt. These results demonstrate that trophic factor withdrawal led to a rapid inactivation of Akt and decrease of inhibitory serine phosphorylation of GSK3 before activation of caspase-3. We tested if inclusion of a single growth factor was sufficient to block the trophic factor withdrawal-induced dephosphorylations of Akt and GSK3 and if this attenuated apoptotic signaling. For this, NPCs were incubated for 4 h in complete trophic factor withdrawal media or with the addition of 50 ng/ml FGF2 or 50 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Stimulation with IGF-1, but not FGF2, was sufficient to maintain phosphorylation of Akt on both Ser-473 and Thr-308 (Fig. 2c) and inhibition-associated phosphorylation of GSK3α on Ser-21 and GSK3β on Ser-9 (Fig. 2d). Stimulation with IGF-1 also abrogated the activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP, whereas FGF2 was without effect (Fig. 2e). Inhibition of GSK3 Protects NPCs from Trophic Factor Withdrawal-induced Caspase-3 Activation—Because GSK3 is known to be an important contributor of apoptotic signaling in many types of cells (20Beurel E. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2006; 79: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), we tested if inhibition of GSK3 protected NPCs from trophic factor withdrawal-induced caspase-3 activation. Treatment with the selective GSK3 inhibitor lithium (22Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar) reduced trophic factor withdrawal-induced decreases of the inhibitory serine phosphorylation of both isoforms of GSK3 (Fig. 3a) and strongly inhibited trophic factor withdrawal-induced caspase-3 activation and PARP proteolysis between 4 and 8 h after withdrawal (Fig. 3b). To verify that this protective effect of lithium was due to inhibition of GSK3, four other selective inhibitors of GSK3 were tested along with lithium. These experiments demonstrated that NPCs were protected from trophic factor withdrawal-induced caspase-3 activation by 5 μm kenpaullone, 5 μm GSK3 inhibitor II, 20 μm indirubin-3′-monoxime, and 5 μm SB216763 (33Coghlan M.P. Culbert A.A. Cross D.A. Corcoran S.L. Yates J.W. Pearce N.J. Rausch O.L. Murphy G.J. Carter P.S. Roxbee C.L. Mills D. Brown M.J. Haigh D. Ward R.W. Smith D.G. Murray K.J. Reith A.D. Holder J.C. Chem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 251-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), similar to the protection provided by 20 mm lithium (Fig. 3c). Quantitation showed these five selective GSK3 inhibitors provided 80-95% protection from caspase-3 activation after 4 h of trophic factor withdrawal (Fig. 3d), verifying that inhibition of GSK3 provides NPCs protection from trophic factor withdrawal. NPC viability was measured after 4, 8, and 12 h of trophic factor withdrawal by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with propidium iodide staining to test if GSK3 inhibition maintained NPC viability (supplemental Fig. 2a). Lithium treatment reduced cell death by 50% after trophic factor withdrawal (supplemental Fig. 2b), and comparison of three GSK3 inhibitors showed that all provided at least 50% protection from cell death 12 h after trophic factor withdrawal (Fig. 3e). Taken together, these results demonstrate that in NPCs trophic factor withdrawal causes rapid dephosphorylation of Akt and GSK3 and caspase-3 activation, and GSK3 inhibitors substantially reduce caspase-3 activation and enhance the viability of NPCs, supporting the conclusion that GSK3 facilitates apoptotic signaling in NPCs. The activation of Bax is a key step in the apoptotic signaling cascade (17Akhtar R.S. Ness J.M. Roth K.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 36Cregan S.P. MacLaurin J.G. Craig C.G. Robertson G.S. Nicholson D.W. Park D.S. Slack R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7860-7869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When Bax is activated in the cytosol it translocates to the mitochondria where it promotes the disruption of mitochondria and the ensuing activation of caspases. Apoptosis-associated activated Bax can be detected with a conformational-specific Bax antibody (30Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry demonstrated a large increase of activated Bax in NPCs after trophic factor withdrawal (Fig. 4a). Trophic factor withdrawal-induced Bax activation was significantly attenuated by treatment with three different GSK3 inhibitors, 20 mm lithium, 5 μm kenpaullone, or 5 μm SB216763 (Fig. 4b). Trophic factor withdrawal did not alter the cellular level of Bax or two other bcl-2 family members, Bak and Bcl-XL (Fig. 4c). These results demonstrate that GSK3 promotes the apoptotic signaling cascade at least in part by promoting apoptotic signaling upstream of Bax activation in NPCs subjected to trophic factor withdrawal. Because trophic factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis activated Bax, GSK3 has been reported to contribute to Bax activation (37Linseman D.A. Butts B.D. Precht T.A. Phelps R.A. Le S.S. Laessig T.A. Bouchard R.J. Florez-McClure M.L. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9993-10002Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and GSK3 inhibitors attenuated Bax activation, we tested if Bax was required for trophic factor withdrawal-induced caspase-3 activation or protection by GSK3 inhibitors. These questions were examined by using NPCs isolated from bax-/- mouse embryos. Caspase-3 activation and the associated proteolysis of PARP caused by trophic factor withdrawal were substantially delayed in Bax-null NPCs compared with matched wild-type control NPCs (Fig. 5a). However, caspase-3 activation was still attenuated by inhibition of GSK3 in Bax-null NPCs (Fig. 5, b and c). This indicates that although GSK3 promotes Bax activation, GSK3 also promotes apoptotic signaling by additional mechanisms independent of Bax that are upstream of caspase-3 activation in the trophic factor withdrawal-induced apoptotic signaling pathway. DNA Damage-induced Apoptosis in NPCs—Apoptotic signaling in NPCs also was induced by the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin, a topoisomerase I inhibitor that induces apoptosis through a p53-dependent mechanism (38Xiang H. Kinoshita Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Morris E.J. Keramaris E. Rideout H.J. Slack R.S. Dyson N.J. Stefanis L. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5017-5026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Camptothecin (10 μm) treatment of NPCs maintained in trophic factor-containing media caused a time-dependent increase in the level of p53 between 2 and 8 h after treatment, indicative of DNA damage (Fig. 6a). Active, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP were increased with an ∼2 h delay after p53 accumulation (Fig. 6a). Immunocytochemistry confirmed the increased caspase-3 activation after camptothecin treatment (supplemental Fig. 3a). Furthermore, camptothecin-induced accumulated nuclear p53 co-immunoprecipitated with GSK3β (Fig. 6b). These results are in agreement with previous reports that after DNA damage NPCs undergo apoptosis by a mechanism dependent on p53 and caspase-3 (28D'Sa-Eipper C. Leonard J.R. Putcha G. Zheng T.S. Flavell R.A. Rakic P. Kuida K. Roth K.A. Development. 2001; 128: 137-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31D'Sa C. Klocke B.J. Cecconi F. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Flavell R.A.

Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1727-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and that in other cell types GSK3β binds p53 in the nucleus after DNA damage to promote subsequent apoptotic signaling (42Watcharasit P. Bijur G.N. Song L. Zhu J. Chen X. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48872-48879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 43Oppenheim R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 453-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2759) Google Scholar). Inhibition of GSK3 Protects NPCs from DNA Damage-induced Apoptosis—Inhibition of GSK3 with lithium modestly reduced the accumulation of p53, whereas it greatly attenuated camptothecin-induced activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP (Fig. 6c). The effects of lithium were compared with three other inhibitors of GSK3, kenpaullone, GSK3 inhibitor II, and indirubin-3-monoxime, 4 h after camptothecin treatment (Fig. 6d). Quantitation of the results from three independent experiments showed that each of the GSK3 inhibitors greatly reduced caspase-3 activation induced by treatment with camptothecin (Fig. 6e). Thus, GSK3 promotes apoptotic signaling in NPCs after DNA damage as well as after trophic factor withdrawal. To examine the role of Bax in DNA damage-induced apoptotic signaling in NPCs and its facilitation by GSK3, NPCs were prepared from wild-type and Bax-null embryos. Camptothecin treatment caused a large increase in active Bax immunoreactivity in NPCs from wild-type mice (supplemental Fig. 3b). This is in accordance with previous reports that Bax is an important intermediate in genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis in NPCs (28D'Sa-Eipper C. Leonard J.R. Putcha G. Zheng T.S. Flavell R.A. Rakic P. Kuida K. Roth K.A. Development. 2001; 128: 137-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31D'Sa C. Klocke B.J. Cecconi F. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Flavell R.A. Roth K.A. J.

Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1727-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Bax activation in response to camptothecin administration was attenuated by treatment with four different GSK3 inhibitors (Fig. 7a). In Bax-null NPCs, the camptothecin-induced increase of caspase-3 activation was retarded compared with wild-type NPCs (Fig. 7b). To examine if caspase-3 activation induced by DNA damage in bax-/- NPCs is also promoted by GSK3, we tested the effects of several GSK3 inhibitors. Pretreatment with lithium inhibited DNA damage-induced activation of caspase-3 and PARP cleavage between 4 and 8 h after treatment of Bax-null NPCs with camptothecin (Fig. 7c). Protection by GSK3 inhibition was confirmed by treatment with two other selective GSK3 inhibitors, indirubin-3′-monoxime and SB216763, which attenuated caspase-3 activation (Fig. 7d). These results indicate that GSK3 promotes DNA damage-induced apoptosis in NPCs, promoting both Bax activation and a Bax-independent mechanism leading to caspase-3 activation.

https://openalex.org/W2058750858,"Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, the neuronal membrane glycoprotein M6a, a member of the proteolipid protein family, was identified to be associated with the μ-opioid receptor (MOPr). Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that M6a interacts agonist-independently with MOPr in human embryonic kidney 293 cells co-expressing MOPr and M6a. Co-expression of MOPr with M6a, but not with M6b or DM20, exists in many brain regions, further supporting a specific interaction between MOPr and M6a. After opioid treatment M6a co-internalizes and then co-recycles with MOPr to cell surface in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Moreover, the interaction of M6a and MOPr augments constitutive and agonist-dependent internalization as well as the recycling rate of μ-opioid receptors. On the other hand, overexpression of a M6a-negative mutant prevents μ-opioid receptor endocytosis, demonstrating an essential role of M6a in receptor internalization. In addition, we demonstrated the interaction of M6a with a number of other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as the δ-opioid receptor, cannabinoid receptor CB1, and somatostatin receptor sst2A, suggesting that M6a might play a general role in the regulation of certain GPCRs. Taken together, these data provide evidence that M6a may act as a scaffolding molecule in the regulation of GPCR endocytosis and intracellular trafficking.

The clinical utility of opiates is greatly limited by adaptive changes in the nervous system causing tolerance, dependence, and addiction. These adaptive changes are initiated by binding of opiate drugs to opioid receptors that are also activated by endogenous opioid peptides (1von Zastrow M. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The μ-opioid receptor mediates the analgesic effects of opioids but is also important for initiating adaptive changes in the nervous system causing opioid tolerance, dependence, and addiction (2Kieffer B.L.

(oxf.). 2002; 66: 285-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). On the cellular level, the repeated opioid exposure induces a rapid phosphorylation of intracellular receptor domains, leading to receptor desensitization followed by receptor internalization (5Williams J.T. Christie M.J. Manzoni O. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 299-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Internalized receptors can be sorted either to a degradative pathway for down-regulation or recycling pathway for reactivation (6von Zastrow M. Svingos A. Haberstock-Debic H. Evans C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that the trafficking and signaling of opioid receptors are regulated by direct interaction with membranal and/or cytosolic proteins (7Bockaert J. Fagni L. Dumuis A.

Here, we found that M6a binds to the μ-opioid receptor and markedly affects receptor endocytosis and recycling. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The MATCHMAKER GAL4 Yeast Two-hybrid System 3 (Clontech) was used to investigate interacting proteins of rat μ-opioid receptor (MOPr). The cDNA fragments encoding the full-length, a truncation (258-398 aa), and the carboxyl tail (340-398 aa) of MOPr (NCBI GenBank accession number GI: 6981309) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGBKT7, containing the Gal4 DNA binding domain. These fusion genes were used as baits to screen a rat brain cDNA library (Clontech) constructed in the pACT2 containing the Gal4 DNA activation domain. As negative control, Gal4-BD-MOPr with empty Gal4-AD and Gal4-AD-M6a-(108-278) with empty Gal4-BD, as well as a fusion of Gal4-BD with human lamin C, which neither forms complexes nor interacts with most other proteins, were used. The murine p53 fused with the Gal4-BD and SV40 large T-antigen fused with Gal4-AD served as positive controls. The screen was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. From clones positive on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine, six were confirmed by yeast mating and filter lift assays for β-galactosidase, with three clones encoding for known proteins including M6a-(108-287) and three clones encoding for novel proteins (16Koch T.

Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—The coding region of M6a gene (GI: 31981997) was subcloned from pCMV-SPORT6-M6a (RZPD) into pCMV-Myc (Clontech) by PCR, which generates amino-terminal Myc-tagged M6a (Myc-M6a). Similarly, the coding region of DM20 gene (GI: 200408) was subcloned from pCMV-DM20 plasmid (kindly provided by Prof. Klaus-Armin Nave (Göttingen, Germany) into pCMV-Myc expression vector. HEK293 cells with and without expressing HA-MOPr were transfected by pCMV-Myc-M6a or pCMV-Myc-DM20 using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed and the resulting extract was subjected to either Western blot analysis or immunoprecipitation as described (17Pfeiffer M.

BRET Assay—The coding sequences without a stop codon of MOPr or its truncations, or DOPr, sst2A, CB1R, mGluR1a, and mGluR5a, were amplified by PCR and were ligated into humanized pRluc-N3 (BioSignal Packard). Similarly, the coding sequences of M6a and its truncation, or DM20, were subcloned into humanized pGFP-C3. For BRET, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with Rluc and GFP fusion plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000. 45 h post-transfection, cells were detached and BRET signal was determined as described (17Pfeiffer M.

GST Affinity Chromatography—GST pulldown experiments were carried out as described (18Liang Y.J. Wu D.F. Yang L.Q. Höllt V. Koch T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Simply, to generate the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, cDNA fragments encoding the fourth, fifth, and sixth transmembrane domains of MOPr (amino acids 185-303, μ-(185-303)) and the carboxyl tail of MOPr (amino acids 340-398, μ(C-tail)) were subcloned in-frame into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2KT encoding GST (Amersham Biosciences). Myc-tagged M6a proteins from stably transfected HEK293 cells were purified and incubated with GST fusion protein or GST beads at 4 °C for 3 h. Following complete wash, bound proteins were eluted and run on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were visualized. In Situ Hybridization—A previously described probe (19Stumm R.K. Zhou C. Schulz S. Höllt V. J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 469: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was used to detect mRNAs for MOPr (GI: 6981309, nucleotides 1249-2077). The coding sequences of M6a, M6b (GI: 9502118), and DM20 were amplified by PCR and then subcloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) for producing relative riboprobes. Generation of 35S-labeled and digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes, hybridization, washing procedures, and detection of hybridization signals were performed as described (20Stumm R. Culmsee C. Schafer M.K. Krieglstein J. Weihe E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 798-811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization signal densities of the sense probes were defined as background levels. Expression patterns detected with the probes for MOPr, M6a, M6b, and PLP/DM20 mRNAs were in excellent agreement with those detected by others (9Yan Y. Narayanan V. Lagenaur C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 370: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Mansour A. Fox C.A. Thompson R.C. Akil H. Watson S.J. Brain Res. 1994; 643: 245-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Because a riboprobe directed against the entire DM20 coding region was used, which does not distinguish the mRNA expression of DM20 and PLP, both DM20 and PLP mRNAs should be detected. The visualization of two different mRNA transcripts in the same section was performed by combining radioactive and nonradioactive in situ hybridization as described (19Stumm R.K. Zhou C. Schulz S. Höllt V. J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 469: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Generation of Stable Cell Lines—MOPr was amino-terminal tagged with the HA epitope tag using PCR and subcloned into pEAK10 (Edge Bio Systems). M6a was amino-terminal tagged with the Myc epitope tag using PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were first transfected with pEAK10-HA-MOPr using Lipofectamine 2000. Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 1.25 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). To generate double stable cell lines, stable HA-MOPr cells were subjected to a second round of transfection with pcDNA3.1-Myc-M6a and selected in the presence of 1.25 μg/ml puromycin and 400 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Multiclones in similar receptor density were used for further study. Radioligand Binding Assay—Binding studies were performed on membranes prepared from stably transfected cells. The dissociation constant (KD) and number of [3H]DAMGO binding sites (Bmax) were calculated by Scatchard analysis using at least seven concentrations of [3H]DAMGO in a range from 0.25 to 10 nm as described (22Koch T. Wu D.F. Yang L.Q. Brandenburg L.O. Höllt V. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—Cells were grown onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips overnight. For the observation of surface receptor and/or M6a internalization, HA-MOPr and/or M6a were surface-labeled with anti-HA and/or anti-M6a antibodies (Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd.) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml at 4 °C for 1.5 h. Subsequently, cells were treated as indicated in this paper prior to fixation and permeabilization as described (23Koch T. Schulz S. Pfeiffer M. Klutzny M. Schröder H. Kahl E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31408-31414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Bound primary antibody was detected with cyanine 2.18- and/or cyanine 3.18-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were permanently mounted in DPX (Fluka) and examined using a Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope. Quantitative Analysis of Receptor Trafficking—Cells were seeded at a density of 5.0 × 104/well in poly-l-lysine-treated 96-well plates overnight. To estimate endocytosis, cells were surface-labeled with anti-HA antibody (1 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 1.5 h and then incubated with and without agonist at 37 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were fixed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:1000; Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature for 2 h. The plate was developed with 50 μl of 2,2′-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (6)] solution (ABTS) (Roche Applied Science). The reaction was analyzed at 405 nm using an Expert Plus Microplate Reader (ASYS) during 15-25 min in real time. The endocytosis was evaluated as the loss of labeled surface receptors. To measure recycling, cells were first exposed to 10 μm DAMGO for 2 h to drive agonist-induced endocytosis to a steady-state level. After wash, cells were subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 30 and 60 min in the presence of 10 μm naloxone to block residual agonist-stimulated internalization of MOPr. Cells were chilled with 4 °C phosphate-buffered saline to stop receptor trafficking. Afterward, receptors were surface-labeled at 4 °C for 2 h. After wash of unbound antibody, cells were fixed and surface receptors were detected as described above. The recycling rate was estimated as a percentage of recovered surface receptors to endocytosed receptors. Protein Interaction Studies of the μ-Opioid Receptor with M6a—A yeast two-hybrid screen of a rat cDNA library using full-length MOPr as bait led to the identification of a cDNA encoding amino acids 108-278 of the membrane glycoprotein M6a. A strong interaction between this M6a fragment and full-length MOPr was verified in yeast mating and β-galactosidase assays (Fig. 1A). To confirm whether an interaction of MOPr with full-length M6a also occurs in mammalian cells, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation studies in HEK293 cells. Expression of epitope-tagged proteins (HA-MOPr, Myc-M6a, and Myc-DM20) was examined by directly immunoblotting extracts from these cells with specific antibodies against HA tag or Myc tag (Fig. 1B, INPUT). For co-immunoprecipitation, HA-MOPr was immunoprecipitated from different extracts using anti-HA antibody (IP, Ab). The resulting precipitates were immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, lane 2, Myc-tagged M6a migrating at ∼35 kDa was detected in immunoprecipitates from co-expressing cells. In contrast, no M6a was detectable in immunoprecipitates prepared under identical conditions from cells expressing only HA-MOPr or Myc-M6a or from a mixture of cells expressing HA-MOPr or Myc-M6a individually (Fig. 1B, lanes 4, 5, and 7, IP Ab, respectively), indicating that the MOPr-M6a complex preexisted in cells prior to cell lysis and was not artificially formed during sample preparation. In the reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody and blot with anti-HA antibody, HA-MOPr was precipitated from co-expressing cells (Fig. 1B, lane 3), but not from cells expressing only HA-MOPr or Myc-M6a (data not shown). Though M6a and DM20 share high homology, DM20 was not co-immunoprecipitated by MOPr (Fig. 1B, lane 9). In addition, the interaction was confirmed by a biophysical method, BRET. A high BRET signal was obtained in cells co-expressing MOPr-Rluc with GFP-M6a, but not with GFP-DM20 (Fig. 1C). This finding indicates a specific constitutive interaction of MOPr with M6a also in living cells. To estimate the binding domains of M6a and MOPr, a series of truncation mutants of M6a and MOPr were generated. The interactions between these truncations and the full length of M6a or MOPr were analyzed by BRET. As depicted in Fig. 2B, BRET signals for the M6a truncation (108-278 aa, yeast two-hybrid hit) indicated a very strong interaction with full-length MOPr. When this M6a mutant (108-278 aa) was truncated into two parts (108-163 and 164-278 aa), both of them failed to interact with the receptor, suggesting that the second extracellular large loop of M6a may play a major role in the MOPr-M6a interaction. However, the second extracellular loop (152-225 aa) itself showed no interaction with the receptor, indicating that both the third and fourth transmembrane domains (TMDs 3 and 4) are required for the direct interaction of MOPr-M6a. This is in agreement with the finding that there is an interaction between the M6a truncation (129-255 aa, including TMDs 3 and 4) and full-length MOPr. The MOPr truncation without its C-tail (1-339 aa) interacted strongly with full-length M6a (Fig. 2C). This demonstrated that the C-tail, which plays a key role in μ-opioid receptor trafficking and signaling, is not the direct interacting domain for MOPr-M6a interaction. Furthermore, we found that the MOPr truncation (1-303 aa) interacted with full-length M6a (Fig. 2C), whereas the MOPr truncations (1-258 and 258-303 aa) showed no positive BRET signal with full-length M6a. In addition, the truncation (186-303 aa, including the fourth, fifth, and sixth transmembrane domains) exhibited interaction with full-length M6a (Fig. 2C). In summary, these findings suggest that the protein stretch/domain including TMDs 4, 5, and 6 of MOPr and the protein stretch/domain including TMDs 3 and 4 of M6a are important regions for the MOPr-M6a interaction. To confirm the direct interaction of MOPr-M6a, GST affinity chromatography was carried out. The MOPr truncation (185-303 aa, including the TMDs 4, 5, and 6) was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (GST-μ185-303 aa) and tested in GST pulldown experiments performed on purified Myc-M6a proteins. As depicted in Fig. 3, full-length M6a was precipitated by GST-μ185-303 aa. As negative control, GST alone did not pull down the M6a protein. To ensure that approximately equal amounts of the eluted GST and GST fusion protein were loaded on the gel, nitrocellulose membranes were probed with anti-GST antibody (data not shown). Consistent with the yeast mating and β-galactosidase assays, GST pulldown experiment also confirmed that the C-tail of MOPr was not the binding region for M6a (Fig. 3). M6a Interaction with a Subset of GPCRs—Because the fourth, fifth, and sixth transmembrane domains of the μ-opioid receptor, which are involved in the interaction with M6a, show high sequence homology with the transmembrane domains of a number of GPCRs, we next investigated whether M6a also interacts with other G protein-coupled receptors. As depicted in Fig. 4, M6a also interacted with another opioid receptor, the δ-opioid receptor (DOPr), with the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R), and with the somatostatin receptor sst2A, but not with the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1a and 5a). This finding suggested that M6a might play a role in the regulation of certain GPCRs. Co-expression of MOPr and M6a in Rat Brain—Previous researchers reported that there is a good correlation between the distribution of mRNA and protein of MOPr in the central nervous system (19Stumm R.K. Zhou C. Schulz S. Höllt V. J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 469: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Mansour A. Fox C.A. Akil H. Watson S.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 22-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). In addition, the distribution of the M6a antigen has been demonstrated to fit well with the pattern of M6a mRNA expression (9Yan Y. Narayanan V. Lagenaur C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 370: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10Roussel G. Trifilieff E. Lagenaur C. Nussbaum J.L. J.

A. 1993; 90: 6736-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Because an anti-M6a antibody for Western blot and immunohistochemical studies is currently unavailable, we evaluated whether there is a co-expression of MOPr and M6a in native cells using double in situ hybridization. In rat brain, both MOPr and M6a mRNAs were expressed in large proportions of thalamic cells (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively), suggesting the co-expression of both MOPr and M6a in the same cells within the thalamus, a main area of pain control in brain (26Ko M.C. Lee H. Harrison C. Clark M.J. Song H.F. Naughton N.N. Woods J.H. Traynor J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As predicted, virtually all MOPr-positive cells expressed M6a mRNA and most M6a-expressing cells were MOPr-positive in many thalamic nuclei. As a representative example from thalamic region, the co-expression of MOPr and M6a mRNAs was shown in Fig. 5D, arrow. We also found a wide co-expression of MOPr and M6a mRNAs in other regions, including cerebral cortex (data not shown). M6a, M6b, and PLP/DM20 belong to the same PLP family and share high homology (8Yan Y. Lagenaur C. Narayanan V. Neuron. 1993; 11: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9Yan Y. Narayanan V. Lagenaur C. J. Comp.

In marked contrast, a co-expression of MOPr mRNA with M6b or PLP/DM20 mRNA was undetectable in the brain regions tested (Fig. 5, E and F, shown as a representative example in thalamus), providing further support for the specific interaction of MOPr and M6a. M6a Does Not Interfere with MOPr Binding—To elucidate the effect of MOPr-M6a interaction on μ-opioid receptor binding and signal transduction, we stably expressed MOPr and/or M6a in HEK293 cells (Fig. 6, A-C). Expression of MOPr and/or M6a was monitored by confocal microscopy and Western blot. For MOPr or MOPr-M6a stable cell line, multiclones in similar expression level of μ-opioid receptors were used for further study because MOPr density affects receptor trafficking and signaling (16Koch T.

Saturation binding experiments revealed no substantial differences between MOPr- and MOPr-M6a-expressing cells with respect to their affinities (KD) to [3H]DAMGO (2.25 ± 0.10 and 2.17 ± 0.22 nm for MOPr and MOPr-M6a, respectively, n = 3) and number of binding sites (Bmax) (2.68 ± 0.26 and 2.10 ± 0.15 pmol/mg protein for MOPr and MOPr-M6a, respectively, n = 3). M6a Augments MOPr Endocytosis and Recycling—Consistent with previous reports (16Koch T. Brandenburg L.O. Schulz S. Liang Y. Klein J. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Finn A.K. Whistler J.L. Neuron. 2001; 32: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), the μ-opioid receptor was localized mainly at the plasma membrane in MOPr-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 6A). However, after co-expression of M6a, MOPr was localized both at the plasma membrane and in endosome-like compartments (Fig. 6C). In addition, the treatment of monensin (a blocker of recycling) induced a remarkable co-localization of MOPr and M6a in intracellular vesicles (Fig. 6D). This finding prompted us to investigate whether MOPr-M6a interaction increases the constitutive endocytosis of μ-opioid receptors. The anti-HA antibody recognizes the HA epitope tag located in the extracellular N-terminal tail of HA-MOPr, and the anti-M6a monoclonal antibody recognizes the extracellular loop of the M6a antigen. These properties of the antibodies make it possible to specifically label MOPr and/or M6a at the surface of living cells and only monitor the trafficking of labeled surface MOPr and/or M6a. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, in MOPr- and MOPr-M6a-expressing cells, M6a and/or MOPr were exclusively confined to the plasma membrane at low temperature (4 °C), which prevents internalization. Incubation of only MOPr-expressing cells at 37 °C for 30 min did not induce substantial constitutive receptor internalization (Fig. 7C). In marked contrast, in co-expressing cells, both MOPr and M6a were found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7D), indicating M6a enhances the constitutive internalization of μ-opioid receptors. In addition to the M6a-facilitated agonist-independent μ-receptor internalization, the treatment of MOPr-M6a-co-expressing cells with μ-agonist resulted in an enhanced receptor internalization (Fig. 7F) compared with cells expressing the receptor alone (Fig. 7E). Quantification of receptor internalization by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed an enhanced constitutive internalization in cells co-expressing M6a (9.4 ± 0.5% versus 26.3 ± 1.4% for MOPr and MOPr-M6a cells, respectively, Fig. 7G, vehicle) but also an augmented DAMGO-induced receptor internalization by co-expression of M6a 32.4 ± 2.7% versus 47.8 ± 1.0% for MOPr and MOPr-M6a cells, res"
https://openalex.org/W2144646931,"Reduced activity of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11beta-HSD2) plays a role in essential hypertension and the sensitivity of blood pressure to dietary salt. Nonconservative mutations in the coding region are extremely rare and do not explain the variable 11beta-HSD2 activity. We focused therefore on the 5'-regulatory region and identified and characterized the first promoter polymorphisms. Transfections of variants G-209A and G-126A into SW620 cells reduced promoter activity and affinity for activators nuclear factor 1 (NF1) and Sp1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed Sp1, NF1, and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding to the HSD11B2 promoter. Dexamethasone induced expression of mRNA and activity of HSD11B2. GR and/or NF1 overexpression increased endogenous HSD11B2 mRNA and activity. GR complexes cooperated with NF1 to activate HSD11B2, an effect diminished in the presence of the G-209A variant. When compared to salt-resistant subjects (96), salt-sensitive volunteers (54) more frequently had the G-209A variant, higher occurrence of alleles A4/A7 of polymorphic microsatellite marker, and higher urinary ratios of cortisol to cortisone metabolites. First, we conclude that the mechanism of glucocorticoid-induced HSD11B2 expression is mainly mediated by cooperation between GR and NF1 on the HSD11B2 promoter and, second, that the newly identified promoter variants reduce activity and cooperation of cognate transcription factors, resulting in diminished HSD11B2 transcription, an effect favoring salt sensitivity."

ABC proteins are composed of four domains, two nucleotide binding domains (NBD) characterized by a highly conserved ATP binding cassette, and two transmembrane domains (TMD). These four modules may be expressed into a single polypeptide (full transporter), two polypeptides (half-transporter), or four polypeptides. The substrates of these transporters are actively transported using ATP hydrolysis as energy source. Substrates include a wide variety of structurally and chemically different compounds such as ions, sugars, lipids, proteins, antibiotics, and drugs (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). Other ABC proteins regulate the activity of channels instead of being transporters themselves (2Higgins C.F. Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana nuclear genome has revealed 129 potential ABC proteins, a large number when compared with other eukaryotes (3Sanchez-Fernandez R. Davies T.G. Coleman J.O. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30231-30244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Most of the Arabidopsis ABC proteins could be assigned to known subfamilies with the exception of a heterogeneous group of ABC proteins lacking transmembrane domains that were termed non-intrinsic ABC protein (NAP). These proteins are reminiscent of ATP binding quarter molecules of prokaryotic ABC transporters. However, up to now none of these NAPs was found to be associated to TMDs, thus reconstituting a complete ABC transporter. During evolution, distinct assembly pathways have arisen to achieve the covalent attachment of the heme prosthetic group to apocytochromes c of bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (4Kranz R.

System I was first described in α and γ proteobacteria, system II in chloroplasts, and Gram-positive bacteria and system III in yeast mitochondria. Although the origin of system III could not be traced back to prokaryotes, mitochondria of plants and of some protists have inherited system I from their endosymbiotic α proteobacteria ancestor. One representative for system I is Escherichia coli, where eight genes named ccm for cytochrome c maturation are essential for the periplasmic assembly of c-type cytochromes (7Thoöny-Meyer L.

In E. coli, ccm genes are organized in an operon starting with ccmA that encodes the nucleotide binding domain of an ABC transporter. The two following genes which encode CcmB and CcmC both contain six transmembrane helices as found in most TMDs. The exact composition of the ABC transporter and its function have been debated for long (for review, see Ref. 10Goldman B.S. Kranz R.G. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, two models have been proposed. The first model proposed that the ABC transporter is involved in heme export and consists of CcmA2BC, with CcmB and CcmC being the two TMDs (11Goldman B.S. Beckman D.L. Bali A. Monika E.M. Gabbert K.K. Kranz R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 724-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 12Goldman B.S. Beckman D.L. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5003-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the second model CcmC delivers heme to the heme chaperon CcmE (13Schulz H. Fabianek R.A. Pellicioli E.C. Hennecke H. ThoönyMeyer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and the ABC transporter consisting of CcmA2B2 is not involved in heme export (for review, see Ref. 14Cianciotto N.P. Cornelis P. Baysse C. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1408-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that the ATPase activity of CCMA is required for the release of holo-CcmE from CcmC (15Feissner R.E. Richard-Fogal C.L. Frawley E.R. Kranz R.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Christensen O. Harvat E.M. Thony-Meyer L. Ferguson S.J. Stevens J.M.

Microbiol. 2006; 61: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) proposed that ATP-driven conformational changes result in the liberation of holo-CcmE from CcmA2BC that would act as a chaperon releaser rather than as true transporter. For Christensen et al. (16Christensen O. Harvat E.M. Thony-Meyer L. Ferguson S.J. Stevens J.M. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 2322-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) the need of ATPase activity for heme transfer from holo-CcmE to apocytochrome c could also be interpreted as the requirement of a compound supplied by the ABC transporter to form or break with the unusual histidine-heme bond in CCME. Transcription studies of the mitochondrial genome of wheat reveal the existence of the ccmB (17Faivre-Nitschke E. Nazoa P. Gualberto J.M. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1519: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), ccmC (18Bonnard G. Grienenberger J.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 81-99Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and ccmF genes (19Gonzalez D.H. Bonnard G. Grienenberger J.M. Curr. Genet. 1993; 21: 248-255Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Giegé P. Rayapuram N. Meyer E.H. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Orthologs of ccmABCF were identified as well on the mitochondrial genomes of Reclinomonas americana, a jakobid flagellate with an ancestral mitochondrial genome (21Lang B.F. Burger G. O'Kelly C.J. Cedergren R. Golding G.B. Lemieux C. Sankoff D. Turmel M. Gray M.W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5190-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, although ccmBCF orthologs are conserved on all mitochondrial genomes of land plant, ccmA could not be found on any of them. The sequence similarity between CcmA and the nuclear encoded NAP10 strongly suggests that ccmA has been transferred to the nucleus as shown in A. thaliana for genes encoding two other plant mitochondrial CCM proteins, the heme chaperone AtCCME (23Spielewoy N. Schulz H. Grienenberger J.M. Thoöny-Meyer L. Bonnard G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5491-5497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase AtCCMH (24Meyer E.H. Giegé P. Gelhaye E. Rayapuram N. Ahuja U. ThoönyMeyer L. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16113-16118Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this work we show that NAP10 is a mitochondrial protein, which has kept the topology of its bacterial counterpart CcmA and has characteristics of the NBD of an ABC transporter. Interaction between AtCCMA and domains of AtCcmB were revealed by yeast two-hybrid assays. Therefore, we propose that NAP10 is the CcmA counterpart of the mitochondrial CCM ABC transporter. Contrary to the mitochondrial ABC transporters described so far, which belong to the full or half-transporter types (25Lill R. Kispal G. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the plant ABC transporter involved in c-type cytochrome maturation makes a novel class of organellar ABC transporter since its TMDs are encoded on the mitochondrial genome and its NBDs are encoded by the nuclear gene NAP10. Cloning and Expression of AtCCMAs, Production of Antibodies—Total RNA was prepared from the aerial parts of 4-week-old A. thaliana plants. cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers as primers for reverse transcription. The coding region of AtCCMA was amplified by PCR using primers P1 and P2 (supplemental Table S1) and cloned into the HindIII/EcoRI sites of pSK, resulting in pNG22, the plasmid used for in vitro transcription/translation. The coding sequence of AtCCMA was amplified using primer P3 and P4 and cloned in pQE60 (Qiagen), generating pNG31. The recombinant CCMA protein expressed in E. coli BL21D3 possesses an additional Val at position +2 and a His6 tag at the C-terminal end. CCMA-His was expressed after induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, affinity-purified under denaturing conditions on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column (Novagen), resolved on preparative SDS-PAGE, and electroeluted. The purified protein was used to immunize rabbits. Anti-AtCCMA-His antibodies were purified by immunoaffinity for the overexpressed protein coupled with CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Using pNG31 as a template, the PCR product obtained with P5 and P6 was digested by SmaI and introduced in the EcoRV site of pACYC184, generating pNG34 used in complementation experiments. Similarly, the AtCCMA coding region was amplified with P7 and P8 using pNG31 as template. The PCR fragment obtained was digested by HindIII and EcoRI and cloned in the corresponding sites of pMALc2 (New England Biolabs) generating pNG35. The fusion protein maltose binding protein (MBP)-CCMA was expressed in Roseta strain E. coli cells (Novagen). After induction by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, it was purified by affinity chromatography under native conditions using an amylose resin column. Subcellular Fractionation of A. thaliana Protoplasts and Sub-mitochondrial Fractionation—Cytosolic, chloroplast, and mitochondrial fractions from A. thaliana protoplasts were obtained as described previously (26Laloi C.

Mitoplasts were prepared as described (27Werhahn W. Niemeyer A. Jansch L. Kruft V.V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Mitoplasts were resuspended at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml, and trypsin was added at 25 μg/mg of mitochondrial proteins and incubated for 30 min on ice. Trypsin inhibitor was added to stop the reaction, and the mitoplasts were recovered after centrifugation through a 27% (w/v) sucrose cushion in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 100 mm K2HPO4, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Membrane and soluble fractions of mitochondria and mitoplast were prepared as described previously (23Spielewoy N. Schulz H. Grienenberger J.M. Thoöny-Meyer L. Bonnard G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5491-5497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Extrinsic membrane proteins were solubilized with 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, for 30 min at 4 °C. Mitochondrial membranes were treated with varying concentrations of urea (3.6 and 7.3 m) and with 6.6 m urea in the presence of 15 mm ATP and 15 mm MgSO4 on ice for 60 min. Centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor allowed the separation of soluble proteins from insoluble ones.

EC21 was transformed with pNG34 or pEC71 containing AtCCMA or EcccmA, respectively, and pRJ3291 containing the reporter cycA gene. E. coli were grown in anaerobic conditions in minimal salt medium in the presence of 5 mm nitrite as the electron acceptor (29Iobbi-Nivol C. Crooke H. Griffiths L. Grove J. Hussain H. Pommier J. Mejean V. Cole J.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 119: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Expression of the reporter cytochrome c550 was induced with 0.4% (w/v) arabinose. Preparation of total bacterial and periplasmic protein extracts and heme staining were performed as described (7Thoöny-Meyer L. Fischer F. Kunzler P. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J.

Immunodetection Assays—Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred on to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Immunodetection with purified anti-AtCCMA antibodies was done at a dilution of 1/1000. Antibodies used as control were directed against the cytosolic Arabidopsis thioredoxin h3, the chloroplastic Chlamydomonas light harvesting complex II, and mitochondrial yeast cytochrome c1 as an intrinsic inner membrane protein, tobacco manganese-superoxide dismutase as a soluble matrix protein, wheat subunit 9 of NADH dehydrogenase as an extrinsic inner membrane protein (32Lamattina L.

In Vitro Import of Radiolabeled Proteins into Isolated Mitochondria—Mitochondria were purified from cauliflower heads using a juice extractor (33Fey J. Vermel M. Grienenberger J.M. Maréchal-Drouard L. Gualberto J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Synthesis of the radiolabeled proteins was done using the coupled reticulocyte transcription/translation system (TNT system, Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. In vitro import assays were performed as described previously (26Laloi C. Rayapuram N. Chartier Y. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14144-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Blue Native PAGE and In-gel ATPase Activity—Blue native PAGE and BN-SDS-PAGE of mitochondrial membrane proteins were carried out as described (20Giegé P. Rayapuram N. Meyer E.H. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Total mitochondrial proteins solubilized with digitonin, 5/1 detergent/protein (w/w), and native MBP-CCMA recombinant protein were loaded on a BN-PAGE. The ATPase activity was visualized by histochemical staining based on the precipitation of lead nitrate by the inorganic phosphate produced by ATP hydrolysis. The BN gel was incubated in 50 mm glycine, pH 8.6, 5 mm MgCl2,5 mm ATP, and Pb(NO3)2 reagent was added stepwise to a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v) as described (34Sabar M. Balk J. Leaver C.J. Plant J. 2005; 44: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—cDNA of AtCcmB were cloned in pSK– after reverse transcription-PCR using primers P9 and P10. A fully edited version (pNG36) was selected after sequencing. cDNA fragments coding for the full-length AtCCMA protein and for seven domains of AtCcmB (corresponding to following regions: B1, Met-1—Ile-19; B2, Pro-33—Trp-52; B3, Ser-61—Gln-99; B4, Leu-110—Gly-129; B5, Gly-138—Pro-167; B6, Leu-168—Tyr-188; B7, Phe-186—Asp-206) were amplified with primers listed in supplemental Table S1. The PCR products obtained were amplified with primers attB1 and attB2 to introduce phage λ att recombination sites. Final products were recombined with pDONR207 (Invitrogen) to obtain entry vectors that were recombined with Clontech pGBKT7- and pGADT7-modified vector (35Dieterle M. Thomann A. Renou J.P. Parmentier Y. Cognat V. Lemonnier G. Muller R. Shen W.H. Kretsch T. Genschik P. Plant J. 2005; 41: 386-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) to obtain constructs expressing all the combinations of AtCCMA or part of AtCcmB fused to the activation (AD) or binding (BD) domains of Gal4. Constructs were transformed in yeast strain pJ69-4A by heat shock. Two-hybrid assays were performed according to standard methods (36MacDonald P.N. Two-hybrid Systems: Methods and Protocols: Methods in Molecular Biology Series. 2001; 177 (, Vol. , Humana Press, Totowa, NJ)Google Scholar). Transformation in yeast was controlled by the growth on media lacking leucine and tryptophan. The expression of reporter genes ADE2 and HIS3 was monitored by the growth on media lacking both adenine and histidine. The expression of lacZ was followed by measuring at A420 the accumulation of the product metabolized by β-galactosidase with 2.2 mm 2-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as substrate. Identification and Expression of AtCCMA—In A. thaliana, five mitochondrial genes encode proteins showing sequence similarities with bacterial CcmB-C proteins and with three domains of CcmF. No ortholog to the bacterial ccmA was found in land plant mitochondrial genomes. The conservation of genes coding for the TMDs of a potential CCM transporter prompted us to search for a nuclear gene encoding the NBD CcmA ortholog. Because of the high sequence similarity between NBD from non-homologue ABC transporters and the limited information concerning CcmA-specific conserved patterns, it was essential to search in a fully sequenced plant genome. Using the tblastn program, we identified the Arabidopsis At1g63270 gene as the best candidate for AtCCMA. The coding region is 690-bp long and codes for a protein of 229 amino acids showing around 30% identity with its bacterial counterparts. This unique gene was registered as NAP10 in the complete inventory of the A. thaliana ABC protein superfamily (3Sanchez-Fernandez R. Davies T.G. Coleman J.O. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30231-30244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). NAP10 belongs to a heterogeneous group of soluble proteins containing a single NBD. AtNAP10 protein sequence is aligned with NAP10 orthologs from other plant species, a subset of bacterial CcmA, and the mitochondria encoded CcmA of the protist Reclinomonas (Fig. 1). AtNAP10 possesses the typical Walker A (P-loop) and Walker B motifs and the ABC signature. In the bacterial CcmA family a conserved charged residue lysine or arginine is found at the 7th position within the ABC signature LSXGQX(K/R)R, whereas a glutamine is found at this position in bacterial importers (11Goldman B.S. Beckman D.L. Bali A. Monika E.M. Gabbert K.K. Kranz R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 724-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 37Ames F.-L.G Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This feature is conserved in AtNAP10 and its plant orthologs. Both bacterial and mitochondrial CcmA subgroups possess a conserved histidine but located at a different position (Fig. 1). The analysis of a full-length AtNAP10 cDNA reveals the presence of an intron in the 5′-untranslated region. No organ-specific expression data were available for AtCCMA. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed the presence of AtCCMA transcripts in A. thaliana stems, leaves, and flowers (data not shown). In Arabidopsis, the protein is detected in cell culture, root, leave, and flower mitochondrial extracts (data not shown). AtCCMA is expressed in all organs of the plant but at low levels, suggesting that this protein has a housekeeping function. Complementation Assay—The bacterial protein CcmA has been shown to be essential for the maturation of c-type cytochromes (28Throne-Holst M. Thoöny-Meyer L. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 38Ramseier T.M. Winteler H.V. Hennecke H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7793-7803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Beckman D.L. Trawick D.R. Kranz R.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 268-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The complementation of ΔccmA E. coli strain EC21 lacking the chromosomal copy of ccmA with AtCCMA for the production of holocytochrome c was tested in anaerobic conditions that induce the expression of the chromosomal ccm operon. ΔccmA E. coli were transformed with a plasmid carrying the reporter cytochrome c550 gene (pRJ3291) and the vector alone pACYC184 or the vector carrying either the bacterial ccmA (pEC71) or AtCCMA (pNG34). Although the bacterial ccmA gene could fully complement the absence of the chromosomal ccmA, resulting in the formation of holocytochrome c550 and two endogenous c-type cytochromes NrfA and NapB, no c-type cytochromes were detected in bacteria transformed with AtCCMA (supplemental Fig. S1). This was not because of the absence of expression of AtCCMA, because the protein is detected in total extract. The inability of AtCCMA to functionally complement ΔccmA E. coli could be due to its failure to associate with the bacterial transmembrane domains to form a functional ABC transporter. AtCCMA Is a Mitochondrial Protein—AtCCMA only possesses a short N-terminal extension of 4–8 amino acids when compared with most bacterial proteins. The amino acids at the N terminus do not form a typical amphiphilic α helix, a characteristic feature of N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences. However, the prediction programs unanimously predicted a mitochondrial location for AtCCMA. Mitochondria from cauliflower, a Cruciferae as is A. thaliana, were used for in vitro import assays. The calculated molecular weight of AtCCMA is 25.9 kDa. When AtCCMA is translated in vitro,2 products are obtained with apparent molecular masses of 28 and 23 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Both proteins could be immunoprecipitated by anti-CCMA antibodies, indicating that these bands correspond to in-frame translation products of AtCCMA (data not shown). After import, a processed band of about 25 kDa was detected (Fig. 2A, lane 2) but disappeared with proteinase K treatment of the mitochondria after import (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Only the 28-kDa protein was resistant to proteinase K (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 3). This protection to proteinase K was lost when the mitochondrial membranes were solubilized with Triton X-100 (Fig. 2A, lane 4). The import of AtCCMA requires an electrochemical membrane potential as evidenced by the inhibition of import after treatment by the ionophore valinomycin (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3 and 6). AtTRX-o1, a thioredoxin of the mitochondrial matrix, was used as a positive control (26Laloi C. Rayapuram N. Chartier Y. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14144-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) to validate the import competence of the mitochondria and the efficiency of the protease treatment. The precursor form of thioredoxin is still detectable after proteinase K treatment. This band corresponds to an imported protein not processed, as often observed in import assays rather than resulting from an incomplete proteolysis of precursor. In the later case such undigested protein should also be detected in the import assay with valinomycin followed by proteinase K treatment. No signal was observed in this assay for both AtTRX-o1 precursor form and AtCCMA 28-kDa band, indicating that, when import is inhibited, the bound precursors are fully digested by proteinase K treatment. We, therefore, conclude that AtCCMA is imported into mitochondria in a membrane potential-dependent manner without apparent processing. To confirm the localization of AtCCMA, an analysis of subcellular protein fractions of A. thaliana protoplasts was carried out by Western blotting and immunodetection with anti-AtCCMA antibodies (Fig. 2B). A 28-kDa signal was detected in mitochondria, which corresponded to the size of the imported AtCCMA in the in vitro import experiments. This band was absent in both cytosolic and chloroplastic extracts, indicating that AtCCMA is exclusively located in mitochondria. Anti-AtCCMA antibodies also recognized unidentified proteins of 66 and 40 kDa in the mitochondrial protein fraction. In addition, a 42-kDa cytosolic protein and a 40-kDa chloroplastic protein cross-react with anti-AtCCMA antibodies. The results obtained with antibodies directed against a cytosolic protein (AtTRX-h3), a chloroplastic protein (LHCII), and a mitochondrial protein (Cyt c1) show no detectable cross-contamination between the different protein fractions obtained. The in vitro import, the immunoprecipitation assays, and the immunolocalization experiments clearly show that the 28-kDa protein corresponds to AtCCMA and is localized exclusively in mitochondria. AtCCMA Is Associated with the Inner Membrane and Oriented toward the Mitochondrial Matrix—The sub-mitochondrial location of AtCCMA was further investigated by the immunodetection of various sub-mitochondrial protein fractions with anti-AtCCMA antibodies. The 28-kDa AtCCMA protein is detected in the membrane protein fraction prepared from mitoplasts but not in the soluble matrix protein fraction (Fig. 3A). Although it is a hydrophilic protein, AtCCMA is present in or associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. Mitoplasts were treated with trypsin to digest proteins located on the intermembrane space side of the inner membrane. Anti-AtCCMA antibodies detected AtCCMA in mitoplasts that had undergone this treatment, indicating that it is oriented toward the matrix (Fig. 3B). Antibodies against Nad9, a subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory complex I facing the matrix (32Lamattina L. Gonzalez D. Gualberto J.M. Grienenberger J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), were used as a control for the intactness of the inner membrane. Nad9 is indeed protected against protease treatment. Conversely, the efficiency of the digestion was ascertained by antibodies directed against the hydrophilic domain of AtCCME oriented toward the intermembrane space (23Spielewoy N. Schulz H. Grienenberger J.M. Thoöny-Meyer L. Bonnard G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5491-5497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). AtCCME is not detected in mitoplasts treated with trypsin. AtCCMA is oriented toward the mitochondrial matrix, a topology analogous to that of its bacterial counterpart. AtCCMA Has Properties of the ATP Binding Domain of an ABC Transporter—The association of AtCCMA with the mitochondrial membranes was further investigated. The mitochondrial m"

Here we report the molecular cloning of a two-pore domain K+ channel LyTASK from L. stagnalis and show that, when expressed in HEK-293 cells, it displays the same biophysical characteristics as the anesthetic-activated K+ current IK(An). Sequence analysis and functional properties show it to be a member of the TASK family of channels with ∼47% identity at the amino acid level when compared with human TASK-1 and TASK-3. By using chimeric channel constructs and site-directed mutagenesis we have identified the specific amino acid 159 to be a critical determinant of anesthetic sensitivity, which, when mutated to alanine, essentially eliminates anesthetic activation in the human channels and greatly reduces activation in LyTASK. The L159A mutation in LyTASK disrupts the stereoselective response to isoflurane while having no effect on the pH sensitivity of the channel, suggesting this critical amino acid may form part of an anesthetic binding site.

Analg. 2003; 97 (2nd.): 718-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although it is generally accepted that these drugs act by binding directly to protein targets, it is far from agreed what these targets are or whether the state of general anesthesia is due to effects at a relatively small number of critical molecular sites or due to the combined effects of small perturbations at a very large number of sites. The molecular targets that have most often been proposed to be responsible for the actions of volatile general anesthetics (3Campagna J.A. Miller K.W. Forman S.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2110-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 4Franks N.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: S72-S81Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 5Rudolph U. Antkowiak B. Nat. Rev.

The 2PK channels form a diverse and highly regulated superfamily of channels that are thought to provide baseline regulation of membrane excitability (7Goldstein S.A.N. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I.

Neurosci. 2007; 8: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The possibility that neuronal excitability might be reduced by the activation of K+ channels has been long considered to be a plausible mechanism for general anesthesia (13Nicoll R.A. Madison D.V. Science. 1982; 217: 1055-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 14Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 395-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Franks N.P. Honore E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and such an anesthetic-activated K+ current was first characterized in molluscan pacemaker neurons (1Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1988; 333: 662-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16Lopes C.M.B. Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a family of 15 channels has been identified in mammals (7Goldstein S.A.N. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberg N. Nature Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 8Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279 (–F801): F793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Patel A.J. Honoré E.

Neurosci. 2007; 8: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) with several members being activated by volatile anesthetics. Most work has been done on TASK and TREK channels. Not only are these channels sensitive to anesthetics (17Patel A.J. Honoré E. Anesthesiology. 2001; 95: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but recent work has also shown that genetically engineered animals that lack these channels have a diminished anesthetic sensitivity (18Linden A.M. Aller M.I. Leppa E. Vekovischeva O. Aitta-Aho T. Veale E.L. Mathie A. Rosenberg P. Wisden W. Korpi E.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 317: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Heurteaux C. Guy N. Laigle C. Blondeau N. Duprat F. Mazzuca M. Lang-Lazdunski L. Widmann C. Zanzouri M. Romey G. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). How anesthetics cause 2PK channel activation at the molecular level, however, is poorly understood. Using a combination of electrophysiology and molecular genetics, some key anesthetic determinants have been identified for both TASK and TREK channels (20Patel A.J. Honoré E. Lesage F. Fink M. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 21Talley E.M. Bayliss D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17733-17742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The identification of specific amino acids that are essential for anesthetic action provides a powerful tool for investigating the importance of the target in the effects of anesthetics in the whole animal. If an amino acid can be identified whose mutation affects only anesthetic sensitivity with little or no effect on other channel properties, then such a mutation can in principle be tested in whole animals to assess the importance of that channel for the in vivo anesthetic phenotype (22Jurd R. Arras M. Lambert S. Drexler B. Siegwart R. Crestani F. Zaugg M. Vogt K.E. Ledermann B. Antkowiak B. Rudolph U. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 23Reynolds D.S. Rosahl T.W. Cirone J. O'Meara G.F. Haythornthwaite A. Newman R.J. Myers J. Sur C. Howell O. Rutter A.R. Atack J. Macaulay A.J. Hadingham K.L. Hutson P.H. Belelli D. Lambert J.J. Dawson G.R. McKernan R. Whiting P.J. Wafford K.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8608-8617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This approach requires two, ideally closely related, isoforms of the channel with very different anesthetic responses (usually differing sensitivities). One difference that has yet to be exploited in this regard is the fact that many general anesthetics show stereoselectivity in their actions (24Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). For the inhalational anesthetics this was first shown using isoflurane with the anesthetic-activated potassium current IK(An) in Lymnaea stagnalis (2Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Science. 1991; 254: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). S(+)-Isoflurane was twice as effective at activating this current as the R(–)-enantiomer. We reasoned that knowledge of the amino acid sequence of the channel from Lymnaea might provide novel information that would help to identify the location of the anesthetic binding sites. In this report we describe the cloning of an anesthetic-activated channel from L. stagnalis and show how its unusual properties can be used to provide information that differentiates between the location of anesthetic binding sites and regions of the channel responsible for transducing anesthetic binding to changes in gating. We exploit the fact that hTASK channels differ greatly in the extent they are activated by the volatile agent chloroform. Using a combination of chimeric constructs (between hTASK-1 and hTASK-3 channels and hTASK-1 and LyTASK channels) and site-directed mutagenesis, we identify a specific amino acid that determines anesthetic sensitivity, and we use stereoselectivity as a criterion to determine its likely role as part of an anesthetic binding site. Isolation of Total RNA from the Central Nervous System of L. stagnalis—Adult L. stagnalis were obtained from Blades Biological, Ltd. (Edenbridge, Kent, UK) and kept in tanks of water at 22 °C until use. The circumesophageal ganglia from 3–4 animals were rapidly removed and placed into snail Ringers (see below). Total RNA was then extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) together with Phase Lock Gel Heavy (Eppendorf, Cambridge, UK) to facilitate the separation between the organic and aqueous phases, and Pellet Paint CO-precipitant (Novagen, Nottingham, UK), a dye-labeled carrier, which allowed easy visualization and localization of the RNA pellet. DNA was removed by treatment with Amplification Grade DNase I (Invitrogen) (1 unit/μg of RNA). The DNase I was then removed by a phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction (25:24:1) followed by a chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) extraction (25Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. 2001; (, Third Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). Degenerate Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA from Lymnaea central nervous system (400 ng) was reverse transcribed with 50 ng of random hexamers in a 20-μl reaction volume using the SuperScript First-strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). To exclude the contribution of genomic DNA to the final PCR step, incubations with and without reverse transcriptase were run simultaneously. The first strand cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification using degenerate primers designed against stretches of conserved amino acid residues at the start and including part of the TM2 region (forward primer: 5′-CGS SGG AAR RGC WTT YTG YAT GTT CTA YG-3′; where S = C/G, R = A/G, W = A/T, and Y = C/T) and within the P2 region (reverse primer: 5′-CRW ART CRC CRA ARC CDA TWG TNG TYA R-3′; where D = A/G/T and N = A/C/G/T) of predicted and cloned 2PK channels. 2 μl of first strand cDNA was amplified (2 μm primers) using the HotStar-Taq Master Mix (Qiagen). PCR reaction mixtures were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. A distinct band of the expected size of ∼300 bp for the putative 2PK channel cDNA was observed. The PCR reaction mixture was purified using QIAquick columns (Qiagen), directly subcloned into the pCRII TOPO vector (Invitrogen) by TA cloning and sequenced on both strands using the universal M13 primers. Sequencing was done by MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). Databases were searched for similar sequences using the BLAST alignment program (26Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends—5′-RACE and 3′-RACE PCR reactions were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the BD SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, St Germain en Laye, France) to obtain the complete 5′- and 3′-ends of the target LyTASK cDNA. The partial sequence of the LyTASK was used to design specific primers for 5′- and 3′-RACE. The primer used for the 5′-RACE was 5′-AGG AGA ATA TGG CCG CCC CCG ACG TGA G-3′. The primer used for the 3′-RACE was 5′-AGA GCG TGG GCG AGC GCC TCA AC-3′. Thermal cycling was performed using touchdown PCR. RACE products were isolated from a 1.2%-agarose gel using a Nucleotrap gel extract kit (Clontech), subcloned into pCRII TOPO vector and sequenced on both strands. The whole coding region of LyTASK cDNA was obtained by PCR using primers designed from the extreme 5′-end (5′-CGG AGA GCA CAC ATG CCT CCA-3′; sense) and 3′-end (5′-TAA ATC TAA TCA GCA ACT TGT GTT-3′; antisense) of LyTASK cDNA with the BD Advantage 2 PCR enzyme system (Clontech) and the 5′-RACE ready cDNA as template. Amplified products were subcloned into pCRII TOPO and sequenced on both strands. Sequence Analysis—L. stagnalis amplicons were used for translated blast searches (tBLASTx) of the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide sequence data base (www.ncbi.nih.gov/BLAST/). The TMpred program (27Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar), which predicts membrane-spanning regions and their orientation using a data base of known transmembrane proteins, was used to predict the topology of the cloned LyTASK. Potential N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted using NetNGlyc 1.0. KinasePhos was used with a 95% prediction specificity to predict putative phosphorylation sites for protein kinases. ClustalW was used to align the deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned LyTASK with 2PK channels from other species. ALIGN was used with default settings to perform pairwise alignments of the deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned LyTASK with 2PK channels from other species. Phylogenetic trees were generated using ClustalW. Expression Vectors—For transfection into modified HEK-293 cells (tsA 201), 1.1-kb cDNA containing the entire coding region for LyTASK was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) via non-directional cloning by ligating into the EcoRI sites after cutting LyTASK/ pCRII TOPO (Invitrogen) with EcoRI. Expression vectors with LyTASK cDNA in the correct orientation were identified by restriction analysis with AgeI and XhoI. pcDNA 3.1(+) expression vectors with cDNA encoding human TASK-1 (GenBank™ accession number NM 002246) and human TASK-3 (GenBank™ accession number NM 016601) were a gift from Dr A. Mathie (Imperial College London). Site-directed Mutagenesis of TASK Channels—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on TASK cDNA using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Complementary primers were designed so as to contain the desired mutation together with a silent mutation introducing a diagnostic restriction site. Mutant DNA constructs were verified by restriction digests and sequencing to confirm the introduction of the correct mutated bases (MWG-Biotech). Chimeric Constructs—Chimeras between the different TASK channels were generated by PCR using the overlap-extension method. The cDNAs encoding the chimeric channels were subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 and confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection into HEK-293 Cells—The HEK-293 cells were maintained under standard conditions in growth media (minimum essential media Eagle with Earle’s salts, l-glutamine and sodium bicarbonate, supplemented with 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% penicillin (10,000 units/ml), streptomycin (10 mg/ml), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) in a 5% CO2:95% air, humidified incubator at 37 °C. For electrophysiological studies, cells were plated on glass coverslips previously coated with poly-d-lysine. Cells were transiently cotransfected with TASK/pcDNA3.1 and green fluorescent protein/pcDNA3.1 using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Transfected cells were identified for electrophysiology using a Nikon microscope with an epifluorescence attachment. Electrophysiological recordings were performed within 24–48 h of transfection. Whole Cell Patch Clamp Recording from HEK-293 Cells—All chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, UK) or VWR International Ltd. (Lutterworth, Leicestershire, UK), unless otherwise stated. The composition of the normal control extracellular solution was (in mm) 140 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 d-glucose, 1 CaCl2, titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Extracellular solutions containing elevated K+ were made by substituting NaCl with KCl. When the extracellular pH was a variable, the extracellular solution was titrated with either NaOH or HCl. For the experiments with zinc and copper, stock solutions of 1 mm ZnCl2 and 500 mm CuCl2, respectively, were prepared in extracellular solution and diluted to the desired test concentrations on the day of the experiment. For experiments with arachidonic acid a stock solution of 100 mm was made in ethanol, kept under nitrogen at –20 °C for no more than 3 days, and was diluted in extracellular solution to the test concentration (10 μm) before the experiments. In experiments with arachidonic acid, the control solution contained the same concentration of ethanol (1.7 mm) as the test solution. Patch electrodes were pulled from thickwalled borosilicate glass capillaries (GC150F-10, Harvard Apparatus, Edenbridge, Kent, UK) using a two-stage vertical puller (PP-830, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan), and their tips were fire-polished. Patch electrodes were back-filled with 0.2-μm-filtered intracellular solution, which consisted of (mm): 120 KCH3SO4, 4 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 3 MgATP, 0.3 Na2-GTP, titrated to pH 7.20 with KOH. Electrode resistances ranged from 3 to 5 mΩ. Voltage clamp recordings were performed in the whole cell configuration using a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200A, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Series resistance was compensated by 80% and monitored during the recording. Voltage commands were applied, and currents were recorded using pClamp 6 software (Axon Instruments). Cells were held at –80 mV and a linear voltage ramp from –120 mV to –0 mV in 2 s followed by a return ramp from 0 mV to –80 mV in 0.5 s, applied at 10-s intervals. Recordings with a positive holding current at –80 mV (indicating a negligible leak conductance) and an access resistance of <20 mΩ were included in the analysis. The output of the patch clamp amplifier was filtered at 100 Hz (–3 dB) using an 8-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices 902, Lyon Instruments, Ltd., UK) before being digitized at 500 Hz and recorded on a computer hard disk via an analog to digital converter (Digidata 1200, Axon Instruments). All experiments were performed at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C), and solutions were applied by a gravity-fed perfusion system. Currents were usually measured from the ramps at –50 mV where the contribution of endogenous currents from HEK-293 cells was negligible. Two-electrode Voltage Clamp Recording from L. stagnalis Neurons—Circumesophageal ganglia from L. stagnalis were excised, and the loose connective tissue overlying the right parietal ganglion was removed. This ganglion was then dissected away intact and held by its nerve root using light suction. The tough endoneurium was removed after softening in Pronase (∼2 mg/ml) for 10–15 min exposing the cluster of light yellow neurons used in these experiments (in the ventral part of the ganglion). The ganglion was held in a small chamber and continuously perfused with normal snail Ringers, which consisted of (in mm): 50 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 4 CaCl2, 4 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 5 glucose titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Electrodes were pulled from 1-mm borosilicate glass capillaries and filled with 2.5 m KCl and had resistances between 10 and 30 mΩ. Following impalement, the chosen cell was carefully removed from the ganglion, and all experiments were performed on completely isolated neurons. A two-electrode voltage-clamp amplifier was used (Axoclamp 2A, Axon Instruments), with the current record being filtered (50 Hz, –3 dB) by an 8-pole Bessel filter. Data were digitized at 200 Hz and transferred to a computer for analysis. Steady-state I-V curves were constructed by slowly ramping the membrane potential (usually at 3 mV s–1) in the depolarizing direction. When the extracellular pH was a variable, the extracellular solution was titrated with either NaOH or HCl and the pH dependence of the anesthetic-activated potassium current IK(An) was measured from cells clamped at –40 mV. This minimized the small contribution of an anesthetic-activated inward current, which is present to varying degrees in Lymnaea right-parietal ganglion neurons and which reverses at ∼–40 mV (data not shown). Zinc- and copper-containing solutions were prepared as described above. Anesthetic Solutions—Anesthetic-containing solutions were made on the day of the experiment, and care was taken throughout to minimize losses of volatile anesthetics. Anesthetic solutions at a chosen concentration were prepared as volume fractions of a saturated aqueous solution. The concentration of the saturated solutions were taken to be 17.5 mm for halothane (28Raventós J. Br. J. Pharmacol. Chemother. 1956; 11: 394-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), 66.6 mm for chloroform (29Firestone L.L. Miller J.C. Miller K.W. Roth S.H. Miller K.W. Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Anesthetics. 1986: 455-470Google Scholar), and 15.3 mm for isoflurane and its enantiomers (2Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Science. 1991; 254: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The optical isomers of isoflurane were prepared, and their purities were analyzed by Anaquest Inc. (Murray Hill, NJ). Chemical purities were 99.0% for S(+)-isoflurane and 99.1% for R(–)-isoflurane; the corresponding optical purity ratios were 99.5%/0.5% and 99.0%/1%, respectively. Statistics and Data Analysis—Data are expressed throughout as means ± S.E., unless otherwise stated. In the figures, when the error bars are not shown they are smaller than the size of the symbol. Concentration-response curves were usually fitted with Hill equations of the form (Equation 1), I=ImaxcnHcnH+EC50nH1 where I is the response, c the concentration, Imax the maximum response, EC50 the concentration for a 50% effect, and nH is the Hill coefficient. Any percentage change was calculated relative to the average of controls taken just before and just after a test application. Statistical significance was assessed using the Student’s t test. Molecular Cloning and Sequence of LyTASK—Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed to hybridize in PCR reactions with conserved regions of 2PK channel cDNAs derived from total RNA extracted from L. stagnalis CNS. Comparison with the databases using TBLASTX identified a cDNA fragment for which the derived amino acid sequence was similar to the region extending from the start of the second transmembrane domain to the end of the second pore domain of previously cloned mammalian 2PK TASK channels. The whole coding region for the channel was obtained using 5′- and 3′-RACE PCR, followed by reverse transcription-PCR using specific primers based on the predicted N and C termini. The cDNA sequence contained an open reading frame of 1083 bases that encoded a 361-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 41 kDa (Fig. 1A). Four transmembrane segments (TM1 to TM4) were predicted (see Fig. 1B) using the TMpred program (27Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar). Two poreforming regions (P1 and P2) containing the TXG(Y/I/F)G consensus motif of potassium channels (see Fig. 1A) also scored highly using this algorithm. The putative K+ channel subunit exhibits a short intracellular N-terminal domain, a large extracellular loop between TM1 and P1, and a large intracellular carboxyl domain (see Fig. 1B), consistent with other known 2PK channels (7Goldstein S.A.N. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberg N. Nature Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 8Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279 (–F801): F793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Patel A.J. Honoré E. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The Lymnaea subunit may potentially undergo several post-translational modifications (see Fig. 1A). One putative N-linked glycosylation site is present in the TM1-P1 loop (Asn-53). Putative intracellular phosphorylation sites for several protein kinases were identified, including two for protein kinase A at Ser-10 and Thr-152; one for protein kinase C at Ser-338; and two for casein kinase II at Thr-334 and Ser-340. An alignment of the amino acid sequence of the Lymnaea subunit with sequences of mammalian 2PK channel members of the TASK subfamily is shown in Fig. 2. The Lymnaea subunit shares ∼47% overall amino acid identity with human and rat TASK-1 and TASK-3 and ∼41% with human and rat TASK-5. The Lymnaea subunit (which we refer to as LyTASK) has a lower degree of similarity to the other cloned mammalian 2PK channels with 20–27% amino acid identity. Sequence identity of the Lymnaea subunit to TASK-1, TASK-3, and TASK-5 is much higher in the core region comprising the transmembrane domains, the extracellular loop, and the pore regions (60% amino acid identity with hTASK-1 and hTASK-3) rather than in the C-terminal domain (24% amino acid identity with hTASK-1, 30% with hTASK-3). The alignment (Fig. 2A) reveals a number of features that are common to TASK-1, TASK-3, TASK-5, and the Lymnaea subunit. It also highlights several features that are not shared between them. The two amino acid motifs P1 and P2 that form the selectivity filter of a 2PK channel are conserved in LyTASK, TASK-1, TASK-3, and TASK-5. LyTASK N-linked glycosylation site (Asn-53) is conserved in the mammalian TASK-1, TASK-3, but not in TASK-5 (see Fig. 2A). TASK-1, TASK-3, TASK-5, and LyTASK all contain a histidine residue immediately downstream of the “GYG” pore motif in the P1 domain (His-98). The protonation of this His-98 has been shown to be critical for the pH sensitivity of TASK-1 (30Morton M.J. O'Connell A.D. Sivaprasadarao A. Hunter M. Pflugers Arch. 2003; 445: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Yuill K. Ashmole I. Stanfield P.R. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 448: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and TASK-3 (32Rajan S. Wischmeyer E. Xin Liu G. Preisig-Muller R. Daut J. Karschin A. Derst C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16650-16657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). TASK-1, TASK-3, TASK-5, and LyTASK also contain an aspartate residue (Asp-204) in the equivalent position in the P2 domain, which has been shown to be important for both normal pH sensitivity and K+ selectivity of TASK-1 (31Yuill K.

https://openalex.org/W2089007226,"Mutations leading to aberrant cytoplasmic localization of Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) have been recently identified as the most frequent genetic alteration in acute myelogenous leukemia. However, the oncogenic potential of this nucleophosmin mutant (NPMc+) has never been established, which casts doubt on its role in leukemogenesis. By performing classical transformation assays, we find that NPMc+, but not wild-type NPM, cooperates specifically with adenovirus E1A to transform primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts in soft agar. We demonstrate that NPMc+ blocks the p19Arf (Arf) induction elicited by E1A. Surprisingly, however, we find that NPMc+ induces cellular senescence and that E1A is able to overcome this response. We propose a model whereby the NPMc+ pro-senescence activity needs to be evaded for oncogenic transformation, even though NPMc+ can concomitantly blunt the Arf/p53 pathway.

Here, we have conducted presteady-state kinetic analyses of these two isomerization steps with the single-headed motor domain of Dictyostelium cytoplasmic dynein by employing fluorescence resonance energy transfer to probe ATPase steps at the primary site and tail positions. Our results show that the recovery stroke at the first isomerization step proceeds quickly (∼180 s–1), whereas the power stroke at the second isomerization step is very slow (∼0.2 s–1) in the absence of microtubules, and that the presence of microtubules accelerates the second but not the first step. Moreover, a comparison of the microtubule-induced acceleration of the power stroke step and that of steady-state ATP hydrolysis implies the intriguing possibility that microtubules simultaneously accelerate the ATPase activity not only at the primary site but also at other site(s) in the motor domain.

The dynein heavy chain, a primal component of the dynein complex, is composed of three distinct structural units, the tail, head, and stalk (7Goodenough U. Heuser J. J. Mol.

The stalk residing between the AAA4 and AAA5 is composed of a long coiled-coil and a small globular tip, which is thought to be the binding site for MTs (8Gee M.A. Heuser J.E. Vallee R.B.

A. 2006; 103: 17736-17740Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic image analyses of an axonemal dynein have suggested that the dynein tail adopts two distinct positions against the head during the ATPase cycle (16Burgess S.A. Walker M.L. Sakakibara H. Knight P.J. Oiwa K. Nature. 2003; 421: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Based on these electron microscopic images, it has been proposed that the tail swings between these two positions in an ATPase-dependent manner to generate the power stroke that permits the active movement of dynein on MTs (16Burgess S.A. Walker M.L. Sakakibara H. Knight P.J. Oiwa K. Nature. 2003; 421: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Steady-state fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements of the dynein motor domain with GFP-based FRET sensors have also shown that the tail adopts two distinct positions, presumably the post-stroke and the pre-stroke positions, depending on the nucleotide states of the AAA1 ATPase site (22Kon T. Mogami T. Ohkura R. Nishiura M. Sutoh K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the coupling of these two tail positions and intermediate states of the ATPase cycle has been established by FRET measurements on motor domains that are trapped in specific intermediate states by means of nucleotides and/or mutations (22Kon T. Mogami T. Ohkura R. Nishiura M. Sutoh K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These studies have led to a tail swing model that describes how the tail position changes depending on ATPase steps (22Kon T. Mogami T. Ohkura R. Nishiura M. Sutoh K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In the tail swing model, the ATPase cycle is assumed to start with the rapid binding of ATP to dynein. Upon the ATP binding, dynein adopts the D-ATP state and then the D*-ATP state after isomerization (Fig. 1A). Here, dynein in which the tail is in the post-stroke position is designated as D, whereas dynein in which the tail is in the pre-stroke position is termed D* (Fig. 1B). At this first isomerization step the tail swings from the poststroke position to the pre-stroke position. ATP hydrolysis follows this isomerization step, and dynein adopts the D*-ADP-Pi state. After Pi release, dynein then enters the D*-ADP state (27Holzbaur E.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5577-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Dynein in the D*-ADP state very slowly undergoes a second isomerization to enter the D-ADP state (27Holzbaur E.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5577-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Holzbaur E.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7010-7016Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). At this step the tail swings from the pre-stroke to the post-stroke position (22Kon T. Mogami T. Ohkura R. Nishiura M. Sutoh K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). After ADP release, dynein is ready to repeat the full ATPase cycle. In this cycle, the power stroke is presumed to occur at the second isomerization step and the recovery stroke at the first isomerization step. This tail swing model was deduced mainly from steady-state FRET measurements on “trapped” intermediate states of the ATPase cycle. Therefore, the model should be further tested in presteady-state kinetic studies that can directly assess the transitions between intermediate states. Here, by employing the FRET signal as a probe for tail positions as well as for ATPase steps at the primary ATPase site, we have monitored the power stroke and recovery stroke steps of the single-headed motor domain of Dictyostelium cytoplasmic dynein. Our results address how these two critical steps of the force generation cycle are coupled with the ATPase steps. Protein Expression and Preparation—Construction of the expression plasmid encoding the 380-kDa cytoplasmic dynein motor domain of Dictyostelium discoideum fused with GFP and BFP (HG380B2) was described previously (22Kon T. Mogami T. Ohkura R. Nishiura M. Sutoh K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, His6-GFP (red-shifted GFP) was fused at the N terminus of the motor domain (Val-1383—Ile-4725) through Gly-Gly-Gly-Lys as a linker. The BFP coding region (Val-2—Lys-238) of EBFP (Clontech) was inserted between codons encoding Ser-2471 and Ser-2472, residues expected to lie between the AAA2 and AAA3 modules. After confirmation by DNA sequencing, the construct was subcloned into the expression vector MB38 for tetracycline-regulated expression in Dictyostelium cells derived from the Ax2 strain, in which expression of the encoded protein is strongly suppressed if tetracycline is added to the culture (29Blaauw M. Linskens M.H. van Haastert P.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 252: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The plasmid was introduced into Dictyostelium cells by electroporation, and transformed cells were selected in HL5 medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml blasticidin S, 10 μg/ml G418, and 10 μg/ml tetracycline. Expressed protein was purified as previously described (30Nishiura M. Kon T. Shiroguchi K. Ohkura R. Shima T. Toyoshima Y.Y. Sutoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22799-22802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Tubulin was purified from porcine brain as previously described (31Sloboda R.D. Rosenbaum J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and kept frozen in liquid N2 until use. For preparation of paclitaxel-stabilized MTs, tubulin was polymerized by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 0.5 mm GTP and 1 mm MgSO4 followed by the addition of 12 μm paclitaxel, and the samples were kept at room temperature. Before use for experiments, the MTs were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 239,00 × g through 0.5 ml of 25% sucrose cushion and resuspended in assay buffer (10 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm potassium acetate, 4 mm MgSO4,1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 20 μm paclitaxel. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Coomassie protein assay reagent; Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Presteady-state Fluorescence Measurements—Presteadystate changes in the FRET signal of HG380B2 were followed with an SX-18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics). Light was provided by a 150-watt xenon arc lamp and passed through a SpectraKinetic monochromator. Time courses of changes in the FRET signal were followed by measurement of GFP fluorescence exciting BFP at 380 nm and monitored at 90° through a 515-nm long-pass filter. Assays were performed in the assay buffer at 25 °C. The final concentration of HG380B2 after mixing was 60 nm unless otherwise mentioned. Dynein solution was supplemented with 0.1 mm ADP in the syringe before mixing unless otherwise noted. For measurements in the presence of MTs, the paclitaxel-stabilized MTs were loaded into both sample syringes of the stopped-flow apparatus at the same concentration unless otherwise noted. The post-stroke to pre-stroke transition was monitored after mixing various concentrations of ATP (0–1 mm, after mixing) into the dynein solution. The pre-stroke to post-stroke transition was observed after the addition of 50 mm glucose and an excess (∼750 units/ml, after mixing) of hexokinase to dynein solutions preincubated with excess ATP. Raw records taken from stopped-flow experiments in the presence of MTs contained significant noise that was independent of the presence of dynein or ATP and was expected to be a flow birefringence artifact. Thus, data obtained by mixing only MTs was subtracted from the raw data of fluorescence changes in dynein before analyses. It should be emphasized that the present dynein construct with the GFP-BFP FRET sensors actually reported FRET signals given the fact that the spatial locations of GFP and BFP in the motor domain did not allow intramolecular contact, 3S. A. Burgess, personal communication. in contrast to a myosin motor domain fused with similar GFP-BFP FRET sensors. This myosin construct was reported to allow detection of the intramolecular association-dissociation of GFP and BFP, but not FRET signals, because the two fluorescent proteins were close enough to allow direct contact (32Zeng W. Seward H.E. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Wakelin S. Woolley R.J. Cheema G.S. Basran J. Patel T.R. Rowe A.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10482-10491Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Measurement of MT-activated Overall Steady-state ATPase Activity—The basal and MT-activated ATPase activities of HG380B2 were measured in the assay buffer containing 250 μm ADP in the stopped-flow apparatus using the EnzChek phosphate assay kit (Molecular Probes). ADP was added here because it was rapidly produced in the FRET measurements of the pre-stroke to post-stroke transition by hexokinase. Although there was a report saying that ADP is an inhibitor of dynein ATPase (27Holzbaur E.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5577-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), virtually no inhibition was observed on the ATPase activity of HG380B2 in the absence of MTs and in the presence of 10 μm MTs when ADP up to 500 μm was added before the addition of ATP. HG380B2 (20–40 nm), various concentrations of paclitaxel-stabilized MTs (0–20 μm), 2 units/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase, 0.4 mm 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside, and 500 μm ADP were incubated in one syringe, and then they were rapidly mixed with same volume of 2 mm ATP. Absorbance at 360 nm was continuously monitored and plotted against time. Steady-state phosphate release rate was calculated from the slope of the plot. The concentration of MTs is expressed as that of tubulin dimer throughout this paper. Kinetics of the Post-stroke to Pre-stroke Transition Probed by FRET—In the tail swing model shown in Fig. 1, the post-stroke to pre-stroke transition is expected to occur at the first isomerization step D-ATP → D*-ATP. To determine the rate of this isomerization step, we followed the FRET signal after rapidly mixing the motor domain fused with GFP-BFP FRET sensors (HG380B2) and ATP (Fig. 2A). The apparent rate of the transition was obtained by fitting the time course to a single exponential. The rates of the pseudo first-order reaction, thus, obtained at varying ATP concentrations showed a hyperbolic ATP concentration dependence (Fig. 2B). This ATP concentration dependence of the apparent rate was analyzed by a kinetic scheme of the tail swing shown in Fig. 1B. Here, we assumed three intermediate states in Fig. 1A, D*-ATP, D*-ADP-Pi, and D*-ADP, to be a single kinetic state since they are indistinguishable in terms of the FRET signal, and moreover, they are in rapid equilibrium due to slow rates of the steps D*-ATP → D-ATP and D*-ADP → D-ADP as shown later. This kinetic state is designated as D*-N, where N represents any of three bound nucleotides (ATP, ADP-Pi, and ADP). The first step in the scheme is the rapid formation of the initial collision complex of dynein and ATP, defined by the equilibrium constant K1. The second step is the first isomerization whereby the tail undergoes the post-stroke to pre-stroke transition. The third step is the second isomerization, i.e. the prestroke to post-stroke transition, which is a very slow and virtually irreversible step in the absence of MTs. It should be noted that this kinetic scheme represents events at the primary ATPase site (AAA1 ATPase site) responsible for the FRET change (22Kon T. Mogami T. Ohkura R. Nishiura M. Sutoh K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). From this scheme the apparent rate of the post-stroke to pre-stroke transition, kobs(post-pre), is described by the equationkobs(post-pre)=K1K2[ATP]/(1+K1[ATP])+k-2(Eq. 1) under the conditions that the second isomerization is sufficiently slow. In Fig. 2B, at low concentrations of ATP the observed pseudo-first-order rate was linearly dependent on ATP concentration and yielded an apparent second-order rate constant K1k2 of 2.2 × 106 m–1 s–1. Above 500 μm ATP, the rate approached the plateau of the maximum rate (k2 + k–2 = 184 ± 2s–1). We then measured the plateau amplitude of the change in the FRET signal upon the addition of ATP (Fig. 3A). This amplitude corresponds to the proportion of HG380B2 molecules in the pre-stroke state after the isomerization step. The amplitude was normalized by the value obtained when a saturating amount of ATP was added, and the normalized ΔF values (%) were plotted against ATP concentration (Fig. 3B). Under the conditions that the second isomerization step is very slow, ΔF values have a hyperbolic ATP concentration dependence that is represented asΔF=100K1K2[ATP]/(1+K1K2[ATP])(Eq. 2) where K2 = k2/k–2. From the plot, K1K2 was estimated as 5.5 × 105 m–1. Because K1k2 was 2.2 × 106 m–1 s–1 as shown above, k–2 was calculated as 4.0 s–1. From this rate of the reverse step of the post-stroke to pre-stroke transition, the rate of the forward step (k2) was calculated as 180 s–1. Kinetics of the Pre-stroke to Post-stroke Transition—Next, we tried to measure the rate k3 of the second isomerization (Fig. 1B), which is the rate-limiting step of the ATPase cycle in the absence of MTs (27Holzbaur E.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5577-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Holzbaur E.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7010-7016Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Whereas the single turnover experiment has been used often to directly determine the rate (33Trentham D.R. Bardsley R.G. Eccleston J.F. Weeds A.G. Biochem. J. 1972; 126: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 34Bagshaw C.R. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), it would not be feasible for dynein since the rate of the reverse step of the first isomerization (k–2) becomes larger than that of the forward step (∼K1k2[ATP]) when ATP concentration is less than 2 μm, considering that K1 k2 is 2.2 × 106 m–1. s –1 Therefore, we devised a method wherein HG380B2 kept in the pre-stroke state was allowed to spontaneously enter the post-stroke state with an apparent rate kobs(pre-post). HG380B2 was first preincubated with sufficient ATP (200 μm) to keep most of the molecules in the pre-stroke state, and then it was rapidly mixed with a solution containing varying amounts of hexokinase to deplete free ATP. The apparent rates of the pre-stroke to post-stroke transition induced by hexokinase were obtained by fitting the time courses of decrease in the FRET signal to single exponentials (Fig. 4A), and these rates were plotted against enzyme concentration (Fig. 4B). At lower concentrations of hexokinase, the observed rates were dependent on enzyme concentration. At higher hexokinase concentrations, however, the observed rate approached kobs(pre-post), giving a transition rate of 4.2 ± 0.1 s–1. Because the overall pre-stroke to post-stroke transition is composed of the reverse step of the first isomerization and the forward step of the second isomerization (Fig. 1B), kobs(prepost) is described by k–2 and k3 askobs(pre-post)=k-2+k3.(Eq. 3) From the observed value of kobs(pre-post) (4.2 s–1) and the calculated value of k–2 (4.0 s–1), k3 was estimated ∼0.2 s–1 .It must be noted here, however, that it is not possible to determine the exact value of k3 since k–2 was indirectly estimated from two different types of measurements (Figs. 2B and 3B) and was very close to kobs(pre-post). Kinetic and equilibrium constants of ATP hydrolysis steps of the dynein motor domain that are coupled with its tail swing steps as illustrated in the scheme in Fig. 1B were determined and are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Kinetic constants of tail swing steps of HG380B2ConstantValueK1 (m-1 s-1)1.2 × 104K246k2 (s-1)180k-2 (s-1)4.0k3 (s-1)∼0.2 Open table in a new tab MTs Accelerate the Pre-stroke to Post-stroke Transition but Not the Post-stroke to Pre-stroke Transition—To determine whether MTs accelerate the first isomerization step, HG380B2 was preincubated with MTs, and 1 mm ATP was rapidly added to the mixture (the concentration of ATP is after mixing). The time course of the change in the FRET signal due to the poststroke to pre-stroke transition well fitted a single exponential as shown in Fig. 5A. At the high concentration of ATP used here, the observed rate (kobs(post-pre)) was almost equal to k2. As shown in Fig. 5B, this rate was virtually independent of MT concentration, especially at higher levels. This result shows that MTs do not significantly affect the post-stroke to pre-stroke transition of the first isomerization step. In contrast to the first isomerization step, the rate of the second isomerization step in Fig. 1B is expected to increase in the presence of MTs because this step is rate-limiting in the ATPase cycle (22Kon T. Mogami T. Ohkura R. Nishiura M. Sutoh K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 27Holzbaur E.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5577-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which will be activated in the presence of MTs (28Holzbaur E.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7010-7016Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined if MTs accelerate the pre-stroke to post-stroke transition by using hexokinase to deplete free ATP as above. HG380B2 and MTs were preincubated with a saturating amount of ATP (500 μm), and an excess amount of hexokinase was then rapidly added to the mixture to suddenly deplete free ATP. The time course of the decrease in the FRET signal due to the spontaneous pre-stroke to post-stroke transition (lower curve in Fig. 5C) was fitted to double exponentials, providing two different rates. The slow drift of the baseline gave rise to a minor slow component. The major component corresponded to the pre-stroke to post-stroke transition. Its rate was linearly dependent on MT concentration and reached 15 s–1 with 10 μm MTs (Fig. 5D), showing that the pre-stroke to poststroke transition is indeed accelerated by MTs. The pre-stroke to post-stroke transition in the presence of MTs is composed of the reverse step of the first isomerization and the forward step of the second isomerization, as in the case of reactions without MTs. However, the former reaction should be independent of MTs, since dynein is most likely to be released first from MTs and then to isomerize for a successful recovery stroke. Therefore, the MT-dependent increment in the rate of the pre-stroke to post-stroke transition upon the sudden depletion of free ATP would result from an acceleration of the second isomerization alone. It should also be noted that the observed overall rate of the pre-stroke to post-stroke transition contained a large contribution from the MT-independent reverse step of the first isomerization (k–2 = 4.0 s –1). Thus, instead of the overall rate of the pre-stroke to poststroke transition, we use this MT-dependent increment represented as the apparent second-order rate constant Kk MT3, where K is the apparent binding constant of HG380B2 in the pre-stroke state with MTs, and k MT3 is the rate of the MT-activated second isomerization step. By plotting the observed rates of the pre-stroke to post-stroke transition in the presence of MTs against MT concentration, Kk MT3 is estimated as 1.0 μm –1 s–1 (Fig. 5D). MT-activated Overall ATP Hydrolysis Is Faster than the MT-activated Pre-stroke to Post-stroke Transition—The acceleration of the second isomerization by MTs shown in Fig. 5D is expected to result in the MT activation of the pre-stroke to post-stroke transition as well as the MT activation of steadystate ATP hydrolysis, since the second isomerization is the ratelimiting step for both processes (22Kon T. Mogami T. Ohkura R. Nishiura M. Sutoh K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 27Holzbaur E.L. Johnson K.A.

To determine whether these two processes are indeed accelerated by MTs in a similar way, we measured the steady-state ATPase rates of HG380B2 in the stopped-flow apparatus under ionic and nucleotide conditions similar to those used for detecting the prestroke to post-stroke transition (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). After rapid mixing of a solution containing HG380B2, varying concentrations of MTs, and the EnzChek phosphate assay kit with ATP, a linear increase of released Pi over a prolonged period of time was observed (data not shown), giving a steady-state ATPase rate. The plot of ATPase rates against MT concentration gave a second-order rate constant of 2.1 μm–1 s–1 (Fig. 5D). This result shows that the second-order rate constant of MT-activated ATP hydrolysis (2.1 μm–1 s–1) is twice that of the MT-activated pre-stroke to post-stroke transition (1.0 μm–1 s–1), implying that MTs increase steady-state ATP hydrolysis twice as much as they increase the pre-stroke to post-stroke transition, which corresponds to the power stroke step. There are four nucleotide binding/hydrolysis sites at the AAA1, AAA2, AAA3, and AAA4 modules in the head of cytoplasmic dynein (17Gibbons I.R. Gibbons B.H. Mocz G. Asai D.J.

Among them, the AAA1 site is most likely the primary ATPase site (20Gibbons I.R. Lee-Eiford A. Mocz G. Phillipson C.A. Tang W.J. Gibbons B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2780-2786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) responsible for the tail swing to drive MT sliding (21Kon T. Nishiura M. Ohkura R. Toyoshima Y.Y. Sutoh K.

Biol. 2005; 12: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and the other sites, especially the AAA3 site, are tightly coupled with the primary ATPase site (21Kon T. Nishiura M. Ohkura R. Toyoshima Y.Y. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11266-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 35Silvanovich A. Li M.G. Serr M. Mische S. Hays T.S. Mol. Biol.

This unique structure of the dynein motor domain makes it difficult to directly examine the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis by conventional presteady-state techniques. To overcome this problem, we employed the FRET signal from the GFP-BFP sensors fused to the dynein motor domain as a probe to report tail positions as well as ATPase steps at the primary ATPase site. The presteady-state kinetics of the change in the FRET signal upon the addition of ATP has revealed that after the rapid formation of the collision complex of the dynein motor domain and ATP, the post-stroke to pre-stroke transition quickly follows at the rate of k2 = 180 s–1. This rapid isomerization step is expected to correspond to the recovery stroke for priming the next power stroke of the tail. Because the reverse step of this isomerization proceeds with an appreciable rate (k–2 = 4.0 s–1), this reaction becomes dominant against the forward step at ATP concentrations lower than 2 μm, unlike what is seen for myosin or kinesin whose first isomerization step is virtually irreversible even at low ATP concentrations (33Trentham D.R. Bardsley R.G. Eccleston J.F. Weeds A.G. Biochem. J. 1972; 126: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 34Bagshaw C.R. Trentham D.R. Biochem.

Therefore, conventional single turnover experiments are not feasible for dynein to determine the rate of the second isomerization step, which is assumed to correspond to the power stroke step (22Kon T. Mogami T. Ohkura R. Nishiura M. Sutoh K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 27Holzbaur E.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5577-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Holzbaur E.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7010-7016Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It should be noted that this reversible isomerization at a low ATP concentration would be also an obstacle for single-molecule experiments such as the observation of single ATP hydrolysis events on dynein because they usually require very low ATP concentrations (∼nm) (38Funatsu T. Harada Y. Tokunaga M. Saito K. Yanagida T. Nature. 1995; 374: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 39Ishijima A. Kojima H. Funatsu T. Tokunaga M. Higuchi H. Tanaka H. Yanagida T. Cell. 1998; 92: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Here we bypassed this problem by determining the rate of the total flow from the pre-stroke state to the post-stroke state. The apparent rate thus obtained (kobs(pre-post)) is the sum of the rate of the reverse step of the first isomerization (k–2) and the rate of the forward step of the second isomerization (k3). Accordingly, k3 was indirectly estimated to be very small (∼0.2 s–1). This slow isomerization rate would be equal to the steady-state ATPase rate at the AAA1 site, whereas the overall rate of ATP hydrolysis by multiple ATPase sites is ∼5 s–1 in the absence of MTs (21Kon T. Nishiura M. Ohkura R. Toyoshima Y.Y. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11266-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 30Nishiura M. Kon T. Shiroguchi K. Ohkura R. Shima T. Toyoshima Y.Y. Sutoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22799-22802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, ATPase sites other than the AAA1 site would be major contributors to overall ATP hydrolysis in the absence of MTs. In fact, a double mutant of the motor domain, P1/P3, in which the P-loops in the AAA1 and AAA3 modules are mutated to block the binding of ATP to the AAA1 and AAA3 sites, still maintains a high ATPase rate (∼4s–1) (21Kon T. Nishiura M. Ohkura R. Toyoshima Y.Y. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11266-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that in the absence of MTs, robust ATP hydrolysis occurs at the AAA2 and/or AAA4 ATPase site(s), whereas the AAA1 and AAA3 sites only slowly hydrolyze ATP. The functional roles of the robust hydrolysis of ATP at the AAA2 and/or AAA4 site(s) in the absence of MTs remain to be resolved. The overall ATPase activity of the motor domain of Dictyostelium cytoplasmic dynein is increased from ∼5 to ∼100 s–1 by saturating levels of MTs (21Kon T. Nishiura M. Ohkura R. Toyoshima Y.Y. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11266-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 30Nishiura M. Kon T. Shiroguchi K. Ohkura R. Shima T. Toyoshima Y.Y. Sutoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22799-22802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), unlike the case of axonemal dynein, whose ATPase activity is activated only severalfold with MTs (40Omoto C.K. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, the issues critical for understanding the molecular mechanism of motor function of cytoplasmic dynein are (i) whether the tail swing probed by FRET is accelerated by MTs as expected from the power stroke model and (ii) which of the multiple ATPase sites in the AAA ring are activated by MTs. The first issue was addressed by following the FRET signal after suddenly depleting ATP from the mixture of ATP, HG380B2, and MTs. The results showed that MTs actually accelerate the second isomerization but not the first isomerization (Fig. 5), further supporting the notion that the second isomerization detected by the FRET signal corresponds to the tail swing of the power stroke. The second issue was addressed by comparing the apparent second-order rate constant of the MT activation of the prestroke to post-stroke transition and that of steady-state ATP hydrolysis. If the AAA1 site is the primary site responsible for the power stroke of the tail and if it is also the only site where ATP hydrolysis is accelerated by MTs, the apparent secondorder rate constants for both processes must be equal because their rates are limited by the same step, i.e. the second isomerization at the AAA1 site. Contrary to the idea that MTs activate only the AAA1 site, the second-order rate constant of the MT-activated ATP hydrolysis is twice that of the MT-activated prestroke to post-stroke transition (2.1 versus 1.0 μm–1 s–1). An intriguing explanation for this discrepancy is that ATPase site(s) other than the primary site may also be activated by MTs. The AAA3 site is a candidate since the ATPase cycle at this site is tightly coupled with that at the primary site (21Kon T. Nishiura M. Ohkura R. Toyoshima Y.Y. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11266-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 22Kon T. Mogami T. Ohkura R. Nishiura M. Sutoh K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Other possibilities must also be considered, however, until the MT-activation of ATP hydrolysis at a site(s) other than the primary site is directly confirmed by a probe that can selectively report nucleotide states at each of these additional site(s)."

NMR triple resonance studies of doubly labeled residues within a set of collagen model peptides provide distance and dihedral angle restraints that allow determination of model structures of both a standard triple helix and of a triple helix with a break in solution. Although the standard triple helix cannot continue when Gly is not every third residue, the NMR data support rod-like molecules that have standard triple-helical structures on both sides of a well defined and highly localized perturbation. The GAAVM break region may be described as a “pseudo triple helix,” because it preserves the standard one-residue stagger of the triple helix but introduces hydrophobic interactions at the position normally occupied by the much smaller and hydrogen-bonded Gly residue of the repeating (Gly-X-Y)n sequence.

Although the collagen triple helix can be considered as one of the most well defined protein motifs, there are still surprises and undefined molecular features. All non-fibrillar collagens contain sites where the repeating Gly-X-Y pattern is interrupted, and evidence suggests that these breaks are of functional importance, playing a role in molecular or higher order structure, or serving as recognition sites for interactions (1Kielty C.M. Grant M.E. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders, Molecular, Genetic and Medical Aspects, 2nd Ed. 2002; (, pp. , Wiley Liss, New York): 159-222Google Scholar, 2Miles A.J. Knutson J.R.

The structural consequences of a break for the triple helix are not understood. The unique triple helix protein motif found in collagen has three extended polyproline II-like chains supercoiled about a common axis. The typical triple helix is characterized by a (Gly-X-Y)n repeating sequence. The three chains are staggered by one residue, and Gly residues must be present as every third residue in each chain so that the three chains can pack very tightly, burying the Gly residues and forming Gly N-H...C=O (X) hydrogen bonds (3Rich A.

The abundant fibrillar collagens, e.g. types I, II, and III, maintain this precise Gly-X-Y repeat throughout their ∼1000-residue triple helix domain, and the replacement of even one Gly by another residue results in a pathological condition (1Kielty C.M. Grant M.E. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders, Molecular, Genetic and Medical Aspects, 2nd Ed. 2002; (, pp. , Wiley Liss, New York): 159-222Google Scholar). But many non-fibrillar collagens have been identified, and these all contain one or more breaks in the repeating Gly-X-Y pattern (1Kielty C.M. Grant M.E. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders, Molecular, Genetic and Medical Aspects, 2nd Ed. 2002; (, pp. , Wiley Liss, New York): 159-222Google Scholar). The non-fibrillar type IV collagen is found in basement membranes of all multicellular animals, and its network architecture contributes to the essential function of basement membranes in providing mechanical support to cells, serving as semi-permeable barriers between tissues, and providing signals for differentiation (6Schittny J.C.

In type IV collagen, there are more than 20 breaks in the ∼1350-residue-long triple helix of the form Gly-X-Y-(AA)n-Gly-X-Y, and the lengths of the breaks range from common short breaks where n = 1, to long breaks where n = 26 (10Zhou J.

To begin to define the effects that small breaks have on triple helix structure, NMR studies are presented here on a model peptide of a type IV collagen break where n = 4. Peptide models can provide an approach to characterizing the effects of breaks on triple helix structure and stability (12Baum J. Brodsky B. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Our laboratories recently reported that a 30-mer homotrimer peptide model for a natural break found in the α5(IV) chain of type IV collagen, GPOGAAVMGPOGPO (residues 386–399, where O is used as a single letter code for hydroxyproline (Hyp) 2The abbreviations used are: Hyp, hydroxyproline (three-letter code); O, hydroxyproline (single-letter code); HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; GFT, G-matrix Fourier Transform; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; PPII, polyproline II; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. ) forms a stable trimeric structure, with a relatively small decrease in stability compared with the triple helical structure of a homologous peptide with Gly as every third residue, GPOGAAGVMGPO (13Mohs A. Popiel M. Li Y. Baum J. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17197-17202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The classic triple helix structure cannot continue when Gly is not present as every third residue, and biophysical studies indicate that the break decreases the triple helix content, destabilizes the triple helix by 10 °C, and reduces the enthalpy substantially. Although NMR experiments reveal a non-random conformation within the break, it was not clear whether there is a way to continue a modified triple helix through this GAAVM region, or whether a new local structure, such as a β-bend, is introduced. Here NMR triple resonance experiments are presented on a set of doubly labeled peptides with and without the GAAVM break (Table 1), allowing the assignment and tracking of individual chains, the identification of intra- and intermolecular NOEs, and the determination of ϕ dihedral angles through 3JHNHa coupling constants. These NMR parameters are used as restraints in energy minimization of molecular models derived from high resolution x-ray structures of several homologous peptides, to allow the first visualization of the solution molecular conformation of a standard triple helix and of a triple helix with a naturally occurring type IV collagen break. The break in the type IV collagen sequence leads to a highly localized distortion of the triple helix. The GAAVM region has a well defined conformation, which maintains the one-residue stagger but introduces hydrophobic packing of three Val residues at the center of the molecule, which would be normally occupied by Gly residues.TABLE 1Peptide sequences of GAAGVM and GAAVMa15N- and 13C-labeled residues are underlined and bolded Open table in a new tab a15N- and 13C-labeled residues are underlined and bolded Sample Preparation—Peptides Ac-(GPO)4GAAGVM(GPO)4GY-CONH2, designated as the GAAGVM peptide, and Ac-(GPO)4GAAVM(GPO)4GY-CONH2, designated as the GAAVM peptide, were synthesized by Tufts University Core Facility (Boston, MA), as previously described (13Mohs A.

In the acquisition dimensions for all experiments, a solvent suppression filter was applied to the data prior to apodization with a 90° sine-bell window function. The data were subsequently zero-filled to 1024 complex points and Fourier transformed.

Reson. 1992; 97: 359-375Google Scholar) an average T1sel value of 84 ms was found for the amide protons of the 15N-labeled GAAVM peptide. Equation 1, below (29Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principle and Practice. 1996; (, pp. , Academic Press, San Diego): 518-528Google Scholar), was solved to determine accurate values of 3JHNHa, and the correction factor of 1.16 was determined. The corrected J coupling constants of doubly labeled GAAGVM and GAAVM peptides were obtained by multiplying the apparent coupling by 1.16. ScrossSdiagonal=−{tan[(1−χ2)1/2ζ](1−χ2)1/2+χtan[(1−χ2)1/2ζ}21 where χ is 1/(2π*T1sel*3JHNHa), ζ is π*3JHNHa*δ, and δ is the H–H coupling period. Generation of NOE Contact Map and Molecular Modeling—A computer model structure of GAAGVM was obtained based on the crystal structure of T3–785 (PDB ID: 1BKV) (30Kramer R.Z. Bella J. Mayville P. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and built using the Molecular Operating Environment 2005.06 (Chemical Computing Group Inc., Montreal, Canada). The GIT-GAR-GLA residues in T3–785 were replaced with the residues GPO-GAA-GVM. The structure was solvated with a standard MOE Water Soak procedure and energy-minimized from residue 6 to residue 21 using the Amber99 all-atom force field (31Ponder J.W. Case D.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 66: 27-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar) to a room mean square gradient of 0.05. This structure was used to generate the background of the NOE map of a standard triple helix motif. Hydrogen atoms were added to the model structure of GAAGVM using the REDUCE program (32Word J.M. Lovell S.C. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1735-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). The predicted background map was generated by calculating NH-H distances equal to or smaller than 5 Å and classifying these as NH-NH, NH-Hα, and NH-side chains (Hβ, Hγ, and Hδ). NOE contact maps for peptides GAAGVM and GAAVM were made from observed NH-H NOEs in the three-dimensional 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC experiment and classified as NH-NH, NH-Hα, and NH side chains (Hβ, Hγ, and Hδ). A refined model of GAAGVM was generated by implementing the ϕ angle restraints from the 3JHNHa values with varying restraint ranges to the energy minimization. Back calculation of 3JHNHa values and back calculation of an NOE map were used to select the best fit model with the experimental data. A model of GAAVM was generated based on the x-ray crystal structure of Hyp (PDB ID: 1EI8) (33Bella J. Liu J. Kramer R. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 298-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Residues GPO-GP were substituted to GAA-VM. The resulting model was energy-minimized with 3JHNHa coupling restraints similarly to the GAAGVM peptide minimization. Energy minimization is very sensitive to the initial starting structure and to the ranges of the restraints; therefore, a number of different input structures with varying restraint ranges were used. Back calculation of 3JHNHa values and NOEs indicated that most structures were not consistent with all of the experimental data. A representative structure that was consistent with experimental 3JHNHa values and all 1H-1H NOEs was selected for GAAGVM and GAAVM. NMR Chain Assignments and Chemical Shift Differences between GAAVM and GAAGVM Peptides—For both peptides, all trimer resonances could be assigned to specific chains of the triple helix as indicated in the heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum by the superscripted number (Fig. 1). The sequential assignment is derived from the triple resonance experiments, and the chain stagger is derived from NOE experiments that define interchain interactions. To obtain the sequence-specific assignments, a series of triple resonance experiments were performed on the control GAAGVM peptide, where each residue in the GAAGV segment of the peptide is double labeled (Table 1). For the GAAGVM peptide, traditional triple resonance experiments, including HNCO (16Ikura M. Kay L.E. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4659-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar)/HN(CA)CO (17Clubb R.T. Thanabal V. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 97: 213-217Google Scholar, 18Yamazaki T. Lee W.

Soc. 1992; 114: 6291-6293Crossref Scopus (931) Google Scholar) experiments were performed (Table 2A). Unambiguous correlations were obtained for residues Gly13-Ala14, Ala15-Gly16, and Gly16-Val17. The resonances arising from the Ala14 residue were highly overlapped in the proton and carbon dimensions, which is likely to be a result of the similarity in environment of the two Ala residues in the GAAG sequence. To resolve the three Ala14-Ala15 connectivities, an additional (5,3)D HACACONHN/HACA, CONHN GFT experiment (14Kim S. Szyperski T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 15Kim S. Szyperski T. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was used and successfully sequentially correlated the chemical shifts of the 13C′–13Cα–1Hα moieties of residue i - 1 and the NH group of residue i for Ala14-Ala15. For the GAAVM peptide complete sequential assignments were obtained for the doubly labeled GAAV segment in the GAAVM peptide from a single pair of HA(CA)NH/HA(CACO)NH (19Kay L.E. Ikura M. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 91: 84-92Google Scholar) experiments (Table 2B), because there was no chemical shift overlap in the NH or Hα dimensions. Assignments were confirmed by the HNCA (16Ikura M. Kay L.E.

For example, NOEs observed between chain 3 3Gly13 NH and chain 1 1Ala15 Hα in GAAGVM and between 1A14NH and 2G13Hα in GAAVM indicated the relationship between chains and allowed identification of the leading (chain 1), trailing chains (chain 3), and middle chains (chain 2) of the peptides. Chain-specific assignments of peaks set the stage for using distance and dihedral angle constraints in structure determination. The HSQC spectrum of the GAAGVM peptide gives a typical pattern expected for the triple helix. Each labeled residue shows at least one monomer peak and one or more trimer peaks, consistent with the presence of the triple helix structure. Gly25 shows only a single trimer resonance due to the repetitive Gly-Pro-Hyp environment (13Mohs A. Popiel M. Li Y. Baum J. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17197-17202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas residues Gly13, Ala14, Ala15, Gly16, and Val17 all have multiple trimer peaks (two peaks for Gly16 and three peaks for all the other residues) due to the non-repeating sequence environment (13Mohs A. Popiel M. Li Y. Baum J. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17197-17202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 34Li M.H. Fan P. Brodsky B. Baum J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15528-15533Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Ala14 and Ala15 have similar chemical shifts to each other, which may reflect their similar environments in the GAAG sequence. The HSQC spectrum of the GAAVM peptide again shows three trimer peaks as well as monomer peaks for each labeled residue. This indicates that a well defined structure with three non-equivalent chains is present in the region where the Gly-X-Y pattern is broken. Gly24, within the Gly-Pro-Hyp repeating region at the C terminus, shows only a single trimer resonance at the typical triple helix position similar to Gly25 above in GAAGVM, whereas three trimer peaks are seen for residues Gly13, Ala14, Ala15, and Val16. Comparison of the chemical shifts of the trimer resonances shows changes in chemical shift for most resonances in GAAVM compared with GAAGVM indicating that there is a difference in the local electronic environment of the central region. Most notably, the Val resonances in the GAAVM peptide have shifted downfield very significantly in both the 1H and 15N dimensions with 3Val16 shifting the most from 7.8 down to 9.4 ppm. The large down-field shift may reflect a change in the hydrogen bonding behavior of Val in GAAVM relative to GAAGVM. Prediction of Short Range Distances in a Classic Triple Helical Conformation from the GAAGVM Model Structure—A predicted contact map in a classic triple helical conformation is generated from a GAAGVM model structure. The high resolution structures of a number of collagen-like peptides have been solved by x-ray crystallography (30Kramer R.Z. Bella J. Mayville P. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 36Kramer R.Z. Vitagliano L. Bella J. Berisio R. Mazzarella L. Brodsky B. Zagari A. Berman H.M. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 301: 1191-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and these structures have confirmed and provided molecular coordinates for the triple-helical structure. A model structure of the GAAGVM peptide was generated by molecular modeling using the crystal structure of the peptide T3–785 ((POG)3-ITGARGLAG-(POG)4 sequence) (30Kramer R.Z. Bella J. Mayville P. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), because it contains a central sequence with no imino acids surrounded by Gly-Pro-Hyp (GPO) triplets. The central GIT-GAR-GLA residues were replaced with the residues GPO-GAA-GVM, and the structure was energy-minimized (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The cross-section of this minimized GAAGVM model structure shows the NH groups of the Gly residues are located near the center of the triple helix and form hydrogen bonds with the CO of the X residue of a neighboring chain (Fig. 2). The NH vectors of the Y residues point outward toward the solvent, while the NH vectors of the X residues point more tangentially toward a neighboring chain within the molecule making a water-bridged hydrogen bond with the C=O of the Gly of the neighboring chain. A predicted contact map is generated from the computer model structure for the GAAGVM peptide and allows computation of distances that are within 5 Å for the backbone NH to backbone NH, Hα, and side-chain protons in this structure (Fig. 3A; shaded squares indicate that there is one or more predicted contact within 5 Å, and circles indicate the individual predicted NOE). A number of salient features can be seen from the contact map and include: (a) Intrachain sequential distances (indicated in gray highlighted boxes) are not symmetric. The NH atoms of residue i (indicated by jNH(i), where j refers to the chain number and i refers to the residue) have a larger number of NOEs to the NH, H, and side chain residues of i - 1 than to the NH, H, and side chain residues of i + 1 (individual predicted NOEs are indicated by circles, which are superimposed on the gray highlighted boxes). (b) Interchain short distances directly across the chain (indicated in yellow highlighted boxes) can be seen for all residues primarily from jNH(i) to j-1NH(i + 1) or to j-1Hα(i + 1). NOEs are also predicted for the jNH(i) to j+1NH(i - 1). These short distances arise directly from the one residue stagger of the triple helix. (c) There are additional interchain contacts between Gly residues, where the corresponding Gly residues in the three chains are packed in the center in a staggered manner (Fig. 2B). This staggered packing results in additional interchain jNH(i) to j+1NH(i) and j+1Hα(i), and jNH(i) to j-1NH(i) and j-1Hα(i) contacts. Additionally, unique NOEs between Gly jNH(i) to j-2NH(i + 3) and j-2Hα(i + 3), and between Gly jNH(i) to j+2NH(i - 3) and j+2Hα(i - 3) are predicted and would correspond to NOEs between 3Gly13 to 1Gly16, and 1Gly16 to 3Gly13. Experimental NOE Observations in GAAVM and GAAGVM—A contact map (Fig. 3B) was generated for the experimental NOE data of the GAAGVM peptide, now using circles to denote the experimental values and highlighted squares of intramolecular (gray) and intermolecular (yellow) NOEs to represent predictions from the GAAGVM model structure (Fig. 3A). The expected intrachain NOEs and some additional interchain NOEs consistent with the close packing of the central Gly and the 1-residue stagger between chains (2G13NH-3O12Hα, 3G13NH-1A15Hα, 1A14NH-3O12Hα/side chain, 2A14NH-1A15Hα) are observed. The chain stagger of 1Val17 and 2Val17 was confirmed from two characteristic NOEs: 3G16NH-1V17 side chain, and 1V17NH-3A15 side chain. There is a high degree of chemical shift degeneracy in the GAAGVM peptide arising from the redundant GAAG central sequence, especially for G13Hα, A14NH, A14Hα, A14Hβ, A15NH, A15Hβ, G16NH, and G16Hα (see half circles in the contact map), and as a result there are some NOEs that are not observed in the experiments when compared with the predicte"
https://openalex.org/W2021519034,"Both genotoxic and oncogenic stress activates the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and p53 proteins; however, the p53 activity is antagonized by NF-κB signaling. Dmp1 is a Myb-like transcription factor that activates the Arf-p53 pathway. The Dmp1 promoter was activated by a classical NF-κB activator tumor necrosis factor α, but repressed by treatment of cells with non-classical NF-κB activators, anthracyclins and UV-C. p65 and other subsets of NF-κB proteins were bound to the Dmp1 promoter following anthracyclin/UV-C treatment of rodent fibroblasts. This resulted in the downregulation of Dmp1 mRNA and protein. Repression of the Dmp1 transcription by anthracyclins depended on the unique NF-κB site on the promoter. Downregulation of p65 significantly attenuated the repression of the Dmp1 promoter by anthracyclins/UV-C. The amount of Dmp1 bound to the Arf promoter decreased significantly upon anthracyclin treatment; this, in turn, downregulated the Arf levels. Repression of the Arf promoter by p65 or anthracyclins depended on Dmp1, which was significantly attenuated in Dmp1−/− cells. Both Dmp1−/−and Arf−/−cells showed resistance to anthracyclin-induced cell death compared to wild-type cells; non-immortalized p65-knockdown cells were much more sensitive. Thus, the Dmp1-Arf pathway is repressed by p65 in response to genotoxic stress, which implicates a novel mechanism of p53 inactivation by NF-κB."
https://openalex.org/W2080190908,"Branching morphogenesis within the peripubertal mouse mammary gland is directed by progesterone (P). A role for the homeobox-containing transcription factor, Msx2, during branching morphogenesis is suggested from its ontogenic expression profile and hormonal regulation. Herein, we define the spatio-temporal control of Msx2 expression, the regulation of its expression by P and its direct role in ductal branching morphogenesis. P induces Msx2 in the presence of estrogen (E) both in vitro and in vivo while absence of the P receptor (PR) decreased Msx2 expression. Stable transfection of PR into mouse mammary epithelial cells increased the endogenous expression of Msx2 and their ability to undergo branching morphogenesis in vitro. Furthermore, normal mammary cells stably-transfected with Msx2 demonstrated increased branching morphogenesis in vitro while transgenic mice expressing Msx2 in their mammary glands demonstrated enhanced lateral branching during early development. The action of P on branching morphogenesis appears to involve Bmp2/4. Together, these data demonstrate that P, acting through PR-A and the Bmp2/4 pathway, induces Msx2 to enhance ductal branching in the mammary glands."

Assembly involves two sets of protein-protein interactions: among cytosolic components and among cytosolic components and cytochrome b559 within its lipid habitat. We circumvented the need for interactions among cytosolic components by constructing a recombinant tripartite chimera (trimera) consisting of the Phox homology (PX) and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of p47phox, the tetratricopeptide repeat and activation domains of p67phox, and full-length Rac1. Upon addition to phagocyte membrane, the trimera was capable of oxidase activation in vitro in the presence of an anionic amphiphile. The trimera had a higher affinity (lower EC50) for and formed a more stable complex (longer half-life) with cytochrome b559 compared with the combined individual components, full-length or truncated. Supplementation of membrane with anionic but not neutral phospholipids made activation by the trimera amphiphile-independent. Mutagenesis, truncations, and domain replacements revealed that oxidase activation by the trimera was dependent on the following interactions: 1) interaction with anionic membrane phospholipids via the poly-basic stretch at the C terminus of the Rac1 segment; 2) interaction with p22phox via Trp193 in the N-terminal SH3 domain of the p47phox segment, supplementing the electrostatic attraction; and 3) an intrachimeric bond among the p67phox and Rac1 segments complementary to their physical fusion.

Phagocytes produce reactive oxygen radicals, part of their microbicidal arsenal, by means of a tightly regulated enzyme complex commonly referred to as NADPH oxidase. At the origin of all oxygen radicals is the superoxide anion (O2-˙), generated by the NADPH-derived one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen. The O2-˙-generating NADPH oxidase complex (briefly “oxidase”) consists of a membrane-associated flavocytochrome (cytochrome b559) comprising two subunits (gp91phox and p22phox) and four cytosolic components (p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and small GTPase Rac1 or Rac2) (reviewed in Refs. 1Nauseef W.M.

Electron flow from NADPH to oxygen occurs along three redox stations, all of which are located on gp91phox: the NADPH-binding site, FAD, and two non-identical hemes.It is assumed that initiation of electron flow is the consequence of a conformational change in gp91phox induced by its interaction with p67phox.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) and possibly also by the binding of a C-terminal domain to gp91phox (13DeLeo F.R. Nauseef W.M. Jesaitis A.J. Burritt J.B.

The mechanism responsible for the binding of p47phox to p22phox has been worked out in great detail and consists of the exchange of an intramolecular autoinhibitory bond between the SH3 tandem and a polybasic region at the C terminus of p47phox for an intermolecular bond between the same SH3 tandem and a PRR at the C terminus of p22phox. The “opening” of the intramolecular bond is the result of phosphorylation of critical serine residues in the polybasic region, found to occur in the course of neutrophil activation (14El Benna J.

The carrier/anchor function of Rac rests on the interaction between the pre-switch I and switch I regions of Rac1 and the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain in p67phox at one end (16Koga H.

Rac has first to be liberated from its bond with the regulatory protein Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor, which keeps Rac in an inactive, GDP-bound conformation in the cytosol (reviewed in Ref. 21DerMardirossian C.

This change is thought to be the consequence of the binding of the GTP-bound form of Rac to p67phox (25Sarfstein R. Gorzalczany Y. Mizrahi A. Berdichevsky Y. Molshanski-Mor S. Weinbaum C.

Ito T. Takeshige K. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4232-4236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the result of the conformational change in p67phox is to augment the actual binding of p67phox to gp91phox (6Dang P.M. Cross A.R. Babior B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3001-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) or to endow p67phox with an ability to elicit electron flow in gp91phox (27Nisimoto Y. Motalebi S. Han C.-H. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

In these, phagocyte membranes or purified cytochrome b559 preparations are exposed to total phagocyte cytosol or to purified or recombinant cytosolic components in the presence of an activator, represented by an anionic amphiphile such as arachidonate, SDS, or phosphatidic acid (28Bromberg Y.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23843-23849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The availability of recombinant proteins for all cytosolic components made it possible to identify functionally significant domains by combining mutagenesis with assay of the mutated components in what became known as the semirecombinant cell-free system (34Abo A. Boyhan A. West I. Thrasher A.J. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16767-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-free systems reproduce the essential steps in oxidase assembly as they occur in vivo, as demonstrated by the fact that anionic amphiphiles mimic the effect of phosphorylation of p47phox, leading to the relief of autoinhibition (35Swain S.D.

A further advance was the design of cell-free systems in which oxidase activation takes place in the absence of an amphiphilic activator. Such systems are based on C-terminal truncation of both p47phox and p67phox (26Hata K. Ito T. Takeshige K. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4232-4236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), on prenylation of Rac (5Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol.

The first of these was a fusion of p47phox (residues 1-286) with p67phox (residues 1-210) (37Ebisu K. Nagasawa T. Watanabe K. Kakinuma K. Miyano K. Tamura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24498-24505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This was followed by the independent description by two groups of p67phox-(1-210 or 1-212)-Rac1 chimeras (39Miyano K. Ogasawara S. Han C.-H. Fukuda H. Tamura M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14089-14097Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 40Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18605-18610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Chimeras of cytosolic components are, in general, characterized by EC50 values lower than those of the non-fused proteins. There is less agreement about the effect of fusion on Vmax values; one group reported higher activities for both p47phox-p67phox and p67phox-Rac1 chimeras in a cell-free system (37Ebisu K.

Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fusion of p67phox and Rac1 reduces the dependence of oxidase activation on p47phox (39Miyano K. Ogasawara S. Han C.-H. Fukuda H. Tamura M.

Finally, prenylation of p67phox-Rac1 chimeras enables oxidase activation in the absence of amphiphile and further reduces its dependence on p47phox (41Gorzalczany Y. Alloul N. Sigal N. Weinbaum C. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18605-18610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).In this study, we describe the design and bacterial expression, in the form of soluble proteins, of tripartite chimeras consisting of selected segments of p47phox, p67phox, and Rac1, which we call “trimeras.” The prototype trimera, resulting from the fusion of p47phox-(1-286), p67phox-(1-212), and full-length Rac1 (amino acids 1-192), was found to act as a potent amphiphile-dependent oxidase activator upon addition to phagocyte membrane or purified cytochrome b559. Modifying the phospholipid composition of the membrane by supplementation with anionic phospholipids enabled oxidase activation by the trimera in the absence of an amphiphile. Truncations, domain replacements, and point mutations applied to critical regions in the three segments composing the prototype trimera led to the acquisition of novel information on the participation of specific sequences and residues in oxidase assembly.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Reagents—The hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog GMPPNP (tetralithium salt, 83%, <0.2% GTP) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The fluorescent hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog mant-GMPPNP (triethylammonium salt) was obtained from Jena Bioscience GmbH. The following chemicals and phospholipids were obtained from Sigma: n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (98%), 14-23% l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC 20%; soybean, type II-S, containing 14-23% phosphatidylcholine and many other lipids, product P5638), l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC; soybean, 99%, product P7443), l-α-phosphatidic acid (PA; sodium salt, egg yolk, 98%, product P9511), l-α-phosphatidyl-dl-glycerol (PG; β-oleoyl-γ-palmitoyl, ammonium salt, synthetic, 99%, product P6956), l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine (PS; soybean, 98%, product P0474), and l-α-phosphatidylinositol (PI; ammonium salt, soybean, 98%, product P5954). 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)) (DOPG; sodium salt, synthetic, >99%, product 840475P), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phosphoinositol 3,4-bisphosphate) (PtdIns(3,4)P2; triammonium salt, synthetic, >99%, product 850153), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) (PtdIns(4,5)P2; triammonium salt, synthetic, >99%, product 850155) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids.Construction of Chimeric Proteins—See supplemental “Experimental Procedures.”Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—All recombinant proteins used in this work, with the exception of full-length p47phox, were expressed in and isolated from Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus™(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). Rac1 was produced in E. coli as described previously (43Koshkin V. Lotan O. Pick E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Chimera 3 (p67phox-(1-212)-full-length Rac1) was expressed and purified as described (40Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Full-length p67phox, p67phox-(1-212), and p47phox-(1-286) were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and purified by batch affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (Sigma), followed by thrombin cleavage (44Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar), as described previously (45Mizrahi A. Molshanski-Mor S. Weinbaum C. Zheng Y. Hirshberg M. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3802-3811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). p47phox was prepared in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described (43Koshkin V. Lotan O. Pick E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The prototype trimera, the trimera lacking the Rac1 C terminus (Rac1ΔC), the trimera with positive residues 183-188 in the Rac1 segment replaced with six neutral residues (glutamines; Rac1(183Q-188Q)), and the trimera lacking the PX domain of p47phox (p47phoxΔPX) were also expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose, followed by cleavage with thrombin. The expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) carrying cDNAs encoding the above-mentioned trimeras was introduced into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus™(DE3)-RIL cells, and bacteria were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 18 °C for 14-16 h. The induced cells were suspended in TMN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). The bacteria were disrupted by exposure to lysozyme (Sigma) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml for 20 min at 4 °C with stirring and by sonication using a 500-watt sonic disruptor (Vibra-Cell, Sonics and Materials, Inc.) at 20% amplitude for 5 min in the 50% pulse mode in ice-cooled beakers. The resulting material was supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and stirred on ice for 15 min. The bacterial lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C; the clear supernatant was applied to glutathione-agarose beads; and binding was allowed to proceed in the batch mode for 60 min at room temperature. The beads were washed with TMN buffer supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by two washes with buffer supplemented with 1 m NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100. Next, in preparation for thrombin digestion, the beads were washed two times with TMN buffer supplemented with 2.5 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside. The latter reduces the aggregation of trimeric fusion proteins, which was encountered occasionally. The bound protein was separated from the glutathione-agarose beads by two sequential digestions with bovine thrombin (Sigma); each digestion was for 60 min at room temperature. After each digestion, the digested proteins were immediately supplemented with 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (Roche Applied Science) to inhibit the proteolytic activity of thrombin. The trimera with residues 183-188 (KKRKRK) in the Rac1 segment replaced with residues 183-188 (RQQKRA) in Rac2 (Rac1→Rac2), the trimera lacking the Rac1 insert domain (Rac1Δinsert), the trimera containing p47phox(W193R), the trimera containing p67phox(R102E), and the trimera containing Rac1(A27K) were expressed as N-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins and purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography. Briefly, pET-28a plasmids (Novagen) carrying the trimera genes listed above were introduced into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus™(DE3)-RIL cells, and the bacteria were induced under conditions identical to those described for GST-fused trimeras. The induced cells were disrupted by lysozyme treatment and by sonication in buffer consisting of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 300 mm NaCl supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor as described for GST-fused chimeras. The bacterial lysate was supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm imidazole and stirred in an ice-cooled vessel for 15 min. Insoluble material was sedimented by centrifugation at 23,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C; the cleared cell-free extract was applied to BD Talon™ metal affinity resin beads (Clontech); and binding was performed in the batch mode at room temperature for 60 min. The beads were washed with the sodium phosphate buffer supplemented with 5 mm imidazole, followed by two washes with the same buffer supplemented with 20 mm imidazole. The His6-tagged trimeras were eluted from the resin with the same buffer supplemented with 150 mm imidazole. All purified trimera proteins were supplemented with 30% glycerol and stored in small aliquots at -75 °C.Characterization of Recombinant Trimeras—The protein concentration of the recombinant fusion proteins was measured by the method of Bradford (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213347) Google Scholar), modified for use with 96-well microplates (81Bio-Rad Laboratories (1984) Bio-Rad Technical Bulletin 1177EG, Richmond, CAGoogle Scholar), using Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent concentrate and bovine γ-globulin as a standard. The level of purity of the recombinant proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis, and the gels were stained with GelCode™ Blue stain reagent (Pierce). Immunoblot analysis was carried out as described (47Abo A. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23577-23585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the detection of p47phox, p67phox, and their corresponding segments in the trimera, we used goat anti-p47phox and anti-p67phox polyclonal antibodies (gifts from T. L. Leto, National Institutes of Health), both diluted 1:2000. For the detection of Rac1 and the Rac1 segment in the trimera, we used an affinity-purified rabbit anti-Rac1 C-terminal peptide polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), diluted 1:2000. The secondary antibodies were affinity-purified alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Sigma) for detection of p47phox and p67phox and affinity-purified alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) for detection of Rac1, both diluted 1:2000. The blots were exposed to the primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h. Alkaline phosphatase activity on the blots was detected as described (48Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). The ability of the trimera to bind GTP was assayed using the fluorescent guanine nucleotide analog mant-GMPPNP as described (49Sigal N. Gorzalczany Y. Sarfstein R. Weinbaum C. Zheng Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4854-4861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The identity and amount of nucleotides bound to recombinant trimera were determined by liberating the bound nucleotides from the protein as described previously (50Bromberg Y. Shani E. Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Sperling O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7055-7058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and identifying the nucleotides by anion exchange chromatography on a Partisil 10 SAX column as described (49Sigal N.

Chem. 2003; 278: 4854-4861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Nucleotide Exchange—For use in oxidase activation assays, Rac1, chimera 3, and trimeras were subjected to nucleotide exchange from the native, GDP-bound form to a state in which the protein-bound nucleotide was GMPPNP or mant-GMPPNP. Nucleotide exchange reactions were performed at a free Mg2+ concentration of 0.5 μm (attained by addition of 12.5 mm EDTA) at a 10-fold molar excess of nucleotide over protein, followed by incubation for 30 min at 30 °C. The exchange was stabilized by addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 25 mm.Gel Filtration—The prototype trimera exchanged to mant-GMPPNP was loaded onto a Superose 12 10/300 GL fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), and chromatography was performed on a Waters HPLC system with TMN buffer at flow rate of 0.2 ml/min at 4 °C. Absorbance at 280 nm was measured continuously by a Jasco Model MD-1510 diode array detector. When the trimera was labeled with mant-GMPPNP, the fluorescence signal (excitation at 361 nm and emission at 440 nm) was also recorded continuously by passing the column eluate through a Jasco Model FP-750 spectrofluorometer fitted with a Jasco Model MFC-132 HPLC flow cell.

Recent studies identified the JmjC domain as a catalytic module for histone demethylation. Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains seven JmjC proteins, but it was unclear whether any of them functioned as histone demethylases. In this report, we show that the JmjC protein Jmj2, which is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human, reversed trimethylated H3-Lys-4 to di- and mono-but not unmethylated products. Overexpression of Jmj2 but not a catalytically inactive mutant reduced H3-Lys-4 trimethylation levels in vivo and suppressed the toxicity caused by overexpression of the H3-Lys-4-me3-binding protein Yng1 in budding yeast. Genome-wide analysis showed that the loss of jmj2 was associated with an increase in the H3-Lys-4-me3 signal, which was enriched near the transcriptional start sites and the coding regions. At the mating-type locus, the loss of jmj2 or substitution of jmj2 with a catalytically inactive form is correlated with increased reporter gene transcription and H3-Lys-4-me3/2 levels, suggesting that Jmj2 and its demethylase activity may play a role in heterochromatin biology.

Histone N-terminal tails are modified by phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and methylation. Each modification can affect chromatin architecture, but the total sum of these modifications may be the ultimate determinant of the chromatin state, which governs gene transcription (1Jenuwein T.

Histone methylation has been implicated in multiple biological processes including heterochromatin formation, X-inactivation, genomic imprinting, and silencing of homeotic genes (3Martin C. Zhang Y.

An added level of complexity results from the fact that lysine residues can be mono-, di-, or trimethylated, which may represent distinct interaction surfaces for the recruitment of different factors that differentially impact the functional outcomes. Histone trimethylation at H3-Lys-4 is linked to active transcription (7Liang G. Lin J.C. Wei V. Yoo C. Cheng J.C. Nguyen C.T. Weisenberger D.J. Egger G. Takai D. Gonzales F.A. Jones P.A. Proc. Natl.

H3-Lys-4 methylation is dynamically regulated by histone methylases and the recently identified mammalian demethylase LSD1 (12Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3035) Google Scholar), which mediates demethylation of H3-Lys-4-me1/2, but not H3-Lys-4-me3, due to the inherent chemistry (12Shi Y.

Given the critical role of H3-Lys-4-me3 in active transcription, it is of significant interest to investigate whether there are demethylases that specifically reverse H3-Lys-4 trimethylation. JmjC domain is a recently identified catalytic module for histone demethylation (13Yamane K. Toumazou C. Tsukada Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wong J. Zhang Y.

In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, there are seven JmjC domain proteins, but it was unclear whether any of them functioned as demethylases. In this report, we provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence that Jmj2 is an H3-Lys-4 trimethyl histone demethylase that catalyzes demethylation of H3-Lys-4-me3 to H3-Lys-4-me1/2 but had no effect on methylation at other lysine residues. Consistent with these observations, overexpression of Jmj2 resulted in a specific reduction of H3-Lys-4-me3/2 in vivo. Genome-wide ChIP 5The abbreviations used are: IP, immunoprecipitation; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; WT, wild type; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; SC, synthetic complete; RT, reverse transcription.5The abbreviations used are: IP, immunoprecipitation; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; WT, wild type; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; SC, synthetic complete; RT, reverse transcription.-on-chip analysis of H3-Lys-4 trimethylation identified a correlation between the loss of jmj2 and increase in H3-Lys-4-me3 levels, further supporting the notion that Jmj2 is an H3-Lys-4 tridemethylase. Importantly, overexpression of Jmj2 as well as the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog YJR119c, but not the catalytically inactive mutants, suppressed the toxicity caused by overexpression of the H3-Lys-4-me3-binding protein YNG1, suggesting a role of H3-Lys-4 histone demethylases in transcriptional regulation. Finally, we show that Jmj2 demethylase activity is necessary for regulating heterochromatin at the mating-type locus, suggesting a potentially important role of this enzyme in heterochromatin biology. Our findings provided unequivocal evidence demonstrating that the evolutionarily conserved Jmj2 functions as a histone H3-Lys-4 tridemethylase and may play important roles in both euchromatic and heterochromatic transcription. Yeast Strains—Deletion of jmj2 and knocking in of the nmt1 promoter were performed by using a PCR-based module method (44Bahler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie III, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). Generation of the point mutant H468A was also carried out by a PCR-based module method using a 70-bp oligonucleotide bearing the point mutation. The strain used for ChIP-chip assay was mat1msmtoleu1032his2irL(BglII)::ade6+ade6DN/N. The Ura4+ reporter assay was carried out with the strain h90mat3::ura4+ura4-DS/E leu1-32 ade6-M210. The following budding yeast strains were used in this study: wild type (MATa his3Δ200 leu2 1 lys2-128Δ ura3-52 trp1Δ63) and set1Δ (MATa his3Δ200 leu2Δ1 lys2-128Δ ura3-52 trp1Δ63 set1::HISMX6). Expression Vectors—jmj2 cDNAs (wild type and H468A mutant) were amplified from S. pombe genomic DNA using Platinum Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) and introduced into the Invitrogen Gateway Entry System. After sequencing of the plasmids, the cDNAs were transferred to the FLAG-baculovirus vector. Protein Purification—FLAG-jmj2 and FLAG-A468H were purified from Sf9 cells as described previously (18Whetstine J.R. Nottke A. Lan F. Huarte M. Smolikov S. Chen Z. Spooner E. Li E. Zhang G. Colaiacovo M. Shi Y. Cell. 2006; 125: 467-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). In Vitro Demethylation Reactions—Demethylation reactions were carried out with 2–10 μg of purified protein using either 1 μm peptide or 5 μg of calf thymus type II-A histones (Sigma) as substrates in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, 1 mm α-ketoglutarate, and 2 mm ascorbic acid for 3–5 h at 30 °C. The reactions were inhibited omitting α-ketoglutarate in the reaction buffer or adding 250 μm DFO (Sigma-Aldrich). MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—1 μl of demethylation reaction was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on an Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-STR instrument as shown previously (18Whetstine J.R.

Western Blot—For total cell extracts, yeast cultures grown to A600 = 0.5 in Edinburgh minimal medium supplemented with amino acids were harvested, cell extracts were prepared using a mini bead beater for cell disruption, and equal amounts of proteins were run in 15% polyacrylamide gels. Dilutions 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin of the following antibodies were used for Western blotting of histones: anti-monomethyl H3-Lys-4 (Millipore catalog number 07-450), anti-dimethyl H3-Lys-4 (Millipore catalog number 07-427), anti-trimethyl H3-Lys-4 (Millipore catalog number 07-423), anti-monomethyl H4-Lys-20 (Millipore catalog number 07-440), anti-dimethyl H4-Lys-20 (Millipore catalog number 07-031), anti-trimethyl H4-Lys-20 (Millipore catalog number 07-463), anti-trimethyl H3-Lys-36 (Millipore catalog number 07-549), anti-monomethyl H3-Lys-9 (Millipore catalog number 07-450), anti-dimethyl H3-Lys-9 (Millipore catalog number 07-441), anti-trimethyl H3-Lys-9 (Millipore catalog number 07-442), and anti-H3 (Millipore catalog number 05-928). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—S. pombe cells were fixed by 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at 30 °C and quenched by 125 mm glycine for 5 min at room temperature. ChIP experiments were carried out as described previously (45Verdel A. Jia S. Gerber S. Sugiyama T. Gygi S. Grewal S.I. Moazed D. Science. 2004; 303: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) by using antibodies against H3-Lys-4-me2 (Millipore catalog number 07-030) and H3-Lys-4-me3 (Millipore catalog number 07-423). Genome wide mapping of H3-Lys-4-Me3 was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Nimbelgen). ChIP analyses were carried out by real-time PCR (Roche Applied Science) (see Fig. 3) or radioactive PCR (see Fig. 5). The following primers were used for ChIP: spcc285.03, 5′-AAGTAGATAAATCTTCTCATTCG-3′ and 5′-GAGGTGATATTTTTAACATGCG-3′; cgs2, 5′-AAACCAAGGTATCAATAGGTACG-3′ and 5′-TTAGTTTATTGGATGATATGGG-3′; cox18, 5′-TTCACTCGTACATGCCATGGTGC-3′ and 5′-CCCTCTGTTGACATACTCTCG-3′; and Ura4, 5′-GAGGGGATGAAAAATCCCAT-3′ and 5′-TTCGACAACAGGATTACGACC-3′.FIGURE 5Jmj2 requirement for transcriptional silencing of a mating-type region reporter gene.

No Tm matching was performed. Each spot was replicated twice on the array, and random GC content probes were included for quality control purposes. The platform design can be found at NCBI GEO under accession number GPL4749. Analysis of Microarray Data—Nimblegen-supplied data files were imported into the Bioconductor computing environment. After performing quantile normalization, genotype-dependent ChIP enrichments were estimated for each probe by fitting a fixed linear model accounting for array, dye, and genotype effects to the data using the LIMMA package (46Smyth G.K. Stat. Appl. Genet Mol. Biol. 2004; 33Crossref Scopus (8971) Google Scholar). Moderated t-statistics and the log-odds score for differential expression or ChIP enrichment were computed by empirical Bayes shrinkage of the standard errors with the false discovery rate controlled to 0.05. Results were loaded into a relational data base for positional analyses into a Generic Genome Browser. Files containing per-probe signal estimates are available (see supplemental data), and all microarray data have been deposited under the provisional NCBI GEO series GSE8175. RT-PCR—For RT-PCR, 5 μg of RNA was used in a RT reaction by using random N9 primer. Ura4+ Reporter Assay—5-fold serial dilutions of exponentially growing liquid cell cultures were spotted on plates starting with 2 × 105 cells. The strains were grown on rich medium (YEA), Edinburgh minimal medium supplemented with amino acids without uracil, and Edinburgh minimal medium supplemented with amino acids and uracil and 1 mg/ml 5-fluoorotic acid. Cells were growing for 4 days at 32 °C. Jmj2 Is a Histone H3-Lys-4-me3-specific Demethylase—The fission yeast S. pombe has seven JmjC domain-containing proteins (supplemental Fig. 1). Among them, Epe1 has been shown to counteract H3-Lys-9 methylation and heterochromatin spreading (21Ayoub N. Noma K. Isaac S. Kahan T. Grewal S.I. Cohen A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4356-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Zofall M. Grewal S.I. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although Epe1 is an ortholog of the human histone demethylase JHDM1 and requires the integrity of the JmjC domain to antagonize heterochromatin spreading, it does not appear to have the demethylase activity when assayed on histone substrates. Although it lacks some of the key residues required for histone demethylation (14Tsukada Y. Fang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Warren M.E. Borchers C.H. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Nature. 2006; 439: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar), whether Epe1 has demethylase activity on other protein substrates remains to be determined. Another jmjC containing protein, Msc1, has been shown to be involved in the regulation of the histone acetylation (23Ahmed S. Palermo C. Wan S. Walworth N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3660-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), underlining the evolutionary conservation of these proteins as chromatin regulators. We took a candidate approach and, in this study, focused on one of the members of this family, Jmj2 (SPAC1002.05c). Jmj2 contains the JmjN and JmjC domains, which have been shown to be important for histone demethylation (24Chen Z. Zang J. Whetstine J. Hong X. Davrazou F. Kutateladze T.G. Simpson M. Mao Q. Pan C.H. Dai S. Hagman J. Hansen K. Shi Y. Zhang G. Cell. 2006; 125: 691-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It also contains an AT rich interacting domain (ARID)/BRIGHT domain, which is a DNA binding motif (25Patsialou A. Wilsker D. Moran E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 66-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Wilsker D. Patsialou A. Zumbrun S.D. Kim S. Chen Y. Dallas P.B. Moran E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and a C5HC2 zinc finger whose function is unknown (supplemental Fig. 1). To determine whether Jmj2 was a histone demethylase, we isolated a full-length jmj2 cDNA from S. pombe genomic DNA by PCR, subcloned it into a Gateway entry vector, and subsequently transferred it to N-terminal FLAG tag baculovirus expression vector for expression and purification to near homogeneity (supplemental Fig. 2A). We used a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric approach to determine whether Jmj2 had histone demethylase activity, using as substrates peptides corresponding to the methylated histone N-terminal tails. As shown in Fig. 1, Jmj2 mediated demethylation at H3-Lys-4 but not at H3-Lys-9, H3-Lys-36, or H4-Lys-20. Jmj2 appeared to be capable of demethylating mono-, di-, and trimethylated H3-Lys-4 in the peptide-based assay. However, when assayed on bulk histones, Jmj2 acted predominantly as an H3-Lys-4-me3/2-specific demethylase, with no detectable effect on H3-Lys-4-me1/2 (Fig. 2A). Like other JmjC domain demethylases, Jmj2 requires Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate as cofactors for the reactions (14Tsukada Y. Fang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Warren M.E. Borchers C.H. Tempst P. Zhang Y.

We generated S. pombe strains in which the wild type Jmj2 or the catalytically inactive Jmj2 mutant (H468A) were under the control of the thiamine-repressible promoter nmt1, which in the absence of thiamine allows for high levels of expression of the gene of interest (28Maundrell K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10857-10864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, overexpression of Jmj2 resulted in a significant decrease in the H3-Lys-4-me3 level, as well as an appreciable reduction of H3-Lys-4-me2, but had no significant effect on H3-Lys-4-me1/2. This is consistent with the in vitro data on bulk histones (Fig. 2A), suggesting that Jmj2 is predominantly an H3-Lys-4-me2/3-specificic demethylase. Importantly, overexpression of the catalytically inactive Jmj2 (H468A) had no effect on either H3-Lys-4-me3 or H3-Lys-4-me2 (Fig. 2B, compare lane 4 with lane 2, top and middle panel), indicating that the changes in H3-Lys-4-me2/3 levels upon overexpression of Jmj2 were likely to be due to its histone demethylase activity. However, deletion of Jmj2 had no discernable effects on global H3-Lys-4 methylation (Fig. 2B, lane 2, top panel). Yeast cells deleted of Jmj2 were viable, suggesting that Jmj2 is not an essential gene. The lack of change of the H3-Lys-4-me3 level could be due to either the presence of additional H3-Lys-4 trimethyl demethylases or the possibility that Jmj2 regulates only a small percentage of the genome; therefore, its ablation would not be expected to cause a global increase of H3-Lys-4-me levels. As a further control, mono-, di-, and trimethylation of H4-Lys-20 and trimethylation of H3-Lys-36 were shown to be unaffected by either the overexpression or the loss of Jmj2 (Fig. 2C), supporting the idea that Jmj2 is an H3-Lys-4-me-specific demethylase. ChIP-on-Chip Identifies Genomic Regions That Are Regulated by Jmj2—Since deletion of the Jmj2 gene does not have a significant impact on the global H3-Lys-4 methylation levels, we next determined the effect of Jmj2 deletion by surveying the entire genome using ChIP-chip analysis. We noticed misregulation of H3-Lys-4 trimethylation where H3-Lys-4-me3 was significantly increased at diverse genomic loci in Jmj2Δ (Fig. 3A). Specifically, average gene analysis, which includes all the open reading frames in the genome, showed that, in Jmj2Δ, H3-Lys-4-me3 was maximally enriched relative to wild type cells around the transcriptional start site, as well as in the 5′ half of the coding region and throughout the promoter (Fig. 3B). Significantly, this analysis also showed substantial decreases in H3-Lys-4-me3 levels in other genomic regions in Jmj2Δ cells (Fig. 3A), including the 3′ end of coding sequences (Fig. 3B). To confirm the ChIP-chip findings, we carried out independent chromatin IP experiments. As shown in Fig. 3C, both H3-Lys-4-me3 and H3-Lys-4-me2 were enriched relative to WT near the transcriptional start site at a number of gene loci upon deletion of jmj2. These included the genes spcc285.03, cgs2, and cox18 (right panels). This provided further in vivo evidence that Jmj2 functions as a demethylase that reverses H3-Lys-4 di- and trimethylation. Jmj2 and Yjr119c Antagonize Yng1, Which Binds H3-Lys-4-me3 and Is Important for H3-Lys-4-me-directed Transcription—In budding yeast, the catalytic subunit of transcription factor II H (TFIIH), Kin28, phosphorylates serine 5 of C-terminal domain of polymerase II (CTD) to recruit Set1 containing COMPASS complex (29Ng H.H.

Therefore, serine 5 phosphorylation of CTD and H3-Lys-4-me3 are enriched at the 5′ end of genes (29Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol.

It is possible that removal of Lys-4 methylation by overexpression of an H3-Lys-4 histone demethylase might suppress this toxicity. Therefore, Yng1-overexpressing cells were used to isolate a budding yeast-specific H3-K4 histone demethylase in vivo. High copy plasmids expressing each JmjC domain protein were introduced in cells expressing Yng1 from GAL1 promoter, and the resulting transformants were tested for the ability to grow on galactose medium. Confirming the previously published data, Yng1 overexpression strongly inhibited the cell growth, and the toxicity was completely abolished by deletion of the H3-Lys-4 methyltransferase SET1 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, overexpression of Yjr119c, the ortholog of Jmj2 in budding yeast, also conferred resistance to Yng1 overexpression, suggesting that Yjr119c may function as a trimethyl-specific H3-Lys-4 histone demethylase in budding yeast (Fig. 4B). Importantly, four other JmjC domain proteins, Jhd1, Rph1, Gis1, and Ecm5, did not rescue the Yng1"
https://openalex.org/W2008503479,"Vav1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is expressed specifically in hematopoietic cells and plays important roles in T cell development and activation. Vav1 consists of multiple structural domains so as to facilitate both its guanine nucleotide exchange activity and scaffold function following T cell antigen receptor (TCR) engagement. Previous studies demonstrated that the calponin homology (CH) domain of Vav1 is required for TCR-stimulated calcium mobilization and thus downstream activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells. However, it remained obscure how Vav1 functions in regulating calcium flux. In an effort to explore molecules interacting with Vav1, we found that calmodulin bound to Vav1 in a calcium-dependent and TCR activation-independent manner. The binding site was mapped to the CH domain of Vav1. Reconstitution of vav1-null Jurkat T cells (J.Vav1) with CH-deleted Vav1 exhibited a severe deficiency in calcium release to the same extent as that of Jurkat cells treated with the calmodulin inhibitor or J.Vav1 cells. The defect persisted even when phospholipase-Cγ1 was fully activated, indicating a prerequisite role of Vav1 CH domain in calcium signaling. The results suggest that Vav1 and calmodulin function cooperatively to potentiate TCR-induced calcium release. This study unveiled a mechanism by which the Vav1 CH domain is involved in calcium signaling and provides insight into our understanding of the role of Vav1 in T cell activation.

The importance of Vav1 is because of its multiple structural elements, including a calponin homology (CH) domain, an acidic motif, a Dbl homology domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a cysteine-rich motif, and one single SH2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains responsible for signaling protein assembly (12Zugaza J.L.

Med. 2002; 195: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Vav1, together with SLP-76 and other adapter proteins, stabilizes PLC-γ1-linker for activation of the T cell complex necessary for tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLC-γ1 (30Braiman A. Barda-Saad M. Sommers C.L. Samelson L.E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 774-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Vav1 was reported to facilitate PLC-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation via GEF-mediated phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent pathways (31Reynolds L.F. Smyth L.A. Norton T. Freshney N. Downward J. Kioussis D. Tybulewicz V.L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, these models were challenged by the fact that oncVav1 (lacking 66 amino acids at the N terminus) or Vav1 bearing mutations in the CH domain failed to provoke calcium flux and NFAT(IL2) activity in T cells, although the domains necessary for GEF activity or complex formation remained intact (13Katzav S. Blood. 2004; 103: 2443-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Cao Y. Janssen E.M. Duncan A.W. Altman A. Billadeau D.D. Abraham R.T.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 3971-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, the CH domain of Vav1 must play a GEF-independent role in TCR-mediated calcium response and NFAT activity. Sequence analysis predicted the CH domain to be involved in F-actin binding (33Castresana J. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Up to now, few proteins were reported to interact with the N terminus of Vav1, such as lymphoid-specific guanine dissociation inhibitor (Ly-GDI) (34Groysman M. Russek C.S. Katzav S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and a polycomb family protein ENX-1 (35Hobert O. Jallal B. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3066-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, the function of the N-terminal domain of Vav1 (CH) and the mechanism by which Vav1 participates in calcium flux are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of Vav1 in regulating calcium signaling in T cells. We found that Vav1 associated with CaM. The binding region was mapped to the CH domain of Vav1, and the association was dependent on calcium. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 had no impact on the interaction. Importantly, we showed that Vav1, via its CH domain, predetermined calcium release from the intracellular store in cooperation with CaM. This study revealed a new binding partner of Vav1 CH domain and may help to understand the mechanisms of Vav1 in T cell calcium signaling. Reagents—The anti-IP3R-1 antibody was purchased from Calbiochem. The anti-CaM antibody was purchased from Upstate. The anti-PLC-γ1 Tyr(P)-783 antibody and anti-α-tubulin antibody were purchased from Sigma. The anti-CD3 mAb OKT3, anti-CD28, anti-Vav1, anti-Zap70, and goat anti-mouse IgG were described previously (18Cao Y. Janssen E.M. Duncan A.W. Altman A. Billadeau D.D. Abraham R.T.

The Indo-1-AM, CaM-agarose beads, protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads, Indo-1-AM, thapsigargin, ionomycin, and W-7 were purchased from Sigma. The 20 mm pervanadate solution was prepared by adding 2.3 μl of 30% H2O2 to 1 ml of 20 m m Na3VO4 and allowing the mixture to react for 5 min at room temperature. Plasmids—The pcDNA3.FLAG.Vav1, pcDNA3.FLAG.ΔCH. Vav1, and pEFΔPH.Vav1 were described elsewhere (32Billadeau D.D. Mackie S.M. Schoon R.A. Leibson P.J. J.

The C-terminal SH3 domain (position 786-845) truncated Vav1 was obtained by PCR and cloned into pcDNA4/HisMax C (Invitrogen) by BamHI and XhoI. To generate the C-terminal SH3 plus IQ domain (position 705-845) truncated Vav1, pcDNA4/HisMax.C.Vav1 was digested with ApoI and filled into blunt end with Klenow, then digested with BamHI, and subsequently cloned into the pcDNA4/HisMax.C vector digested with BamHI and EcoRV. Vav1 or Vav1ΔCH fragment was cloned into HIV retrovirus expression vector by replacing the EGFP fragment using BamHI and XhoI. Nucleotide sequences of new constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Stimulation—Jurkat T leukemia cells and J.Vav1 cells were obtained as described previously (18Cao Y. Janssen E.M. Duncan A.W. Altman A. Billadeau D.D. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4809-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Primary lymphocytes were kindly provided by the Institute of Blood Diseases (Tianjin, China). Jurkat T leukemia cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. For transient transfections, 2 × 107 Jurkat cells were electroporated with a BTX Electro-square Porator model ECM830 (BTX Inc., San Diego) at 310 mV, 10 ms with 30 μg of total DNA. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C. 3 × 106 293T cells were transfected with a total of 25 μg of plasmid by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The concentrations of the stimuli used in both luciferase reporter assays and biochemical assays were 1 μg/ml OKT3 (cross-linked with 1 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgG), 5 μg/ml CD28, and 1 μm ionomycin. Luciferase Reporter Assay—The reporter constructs were described previously (18Cao Y. Janssen E.M. Duncan A.W. Altman A. Billadeau D.D. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4809-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to determine the activity of firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luciferase activity in cell extracts was measured in a TD20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs Inc, Sunnyvale, CA) by injecting 100 μl of assay buffer and measuring light emission for 10 s after injection. Normalized luciferase activity was obtained by dividing the firefly luciferase activity by the Renilla luciferase activity. Retroviral Transduction—Recombinant retroviruses were generated as described previously (37Naldini L. Blomer U. Gage F.H. Trono D. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11382-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected with 40 μg of plasmids consisting of HIV trans, vesicular stomatitis virus G, and the HIV-Vav1/HIV-Vav1ΔCH using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. 48 h after the transfection, supernatants were collected and centrifuged to remove cell debris. The processed supernatants were then mixed with J.Vav1 cells and centrifuged at the speed of 2000 × g for 2 h at 25 °C. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for another 2 h. Supernatants were removed by centrifuge, and transduced cells were cultured in 37 °C incubator with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. Calcium Measurement—1 × 107 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of HBSS supplemented with 5 mm dextrose and buffered to pH 7.0 with HEPES. Indo-1-AM was added to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 5 mm, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. An equal volume of HBSS (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm dextrose was then added, and the mixture was incubated for another 30 min at 37 °C. The Indo-1-loaded cells were washed with HBSS (pH 7.5) supplemented with 5 mm dextrose and 0.05% bovine serum albumin. Samples were prewarmed for 5 min at 25 °C. To determine changes in [Ca2+]i, a cuvette filled with 1 ml of Indo-1 loaded cells was mounted to a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and were excited at 352 nm (5 nm slit) while being imaged simultaneously at emission wavelengths of 398 and 490 nm (10 nm slit). Cells were stimulated with the indicated agents, and the concentrations of the stimuli were 1 μg/ml OKT3 (cross-linked with 1 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgG), 100 μm pervanadate, 1 μm thapsigargin, or 1 μm ionomycin, respectively. Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—For pulldown assay, the whole-cell lysates were prepared in ice-cold RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). After centrifuging at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, the cell lysates were incubated with CaM-agarose or control agarose for 2 h at 4 °C as described in the figure legends. After washing four times, the bound proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. For co-immunoprecipitation assay, the cells were lysed and incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads plus antibodies against Vav1 or CaM, respectively, for 4 h at 4 °C. After washing three times, the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Vav1 Is Prerequisite to TCR-induced Intracellular Calcium Release—T cell stimulation evokes a biphasic calcium flux, the calcium release followed by calcium depletion-activated calcium entry (7Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 19Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). We firstly recorded cellular [Ca2+]i profiles of Jurkat cells, vav1-null cells (J.Vav1), and wild type Vav1 reconstituted J.Vav1 cells (J.WT), respectively. Upon TCR activation by OKT3, J.Vav1 cells exhibited a slightly attenuated early Ca2+ spike and failed to sustain the later Ca2+ plateau (Fig. 1A). The abnormal calcium flux of J. Vav1 cells may result from the combination of the following two processes: 1) defective Ca2+ release from intracellular store; and 2) impaired Ca2+ influx through CRAC. To dissect the two scenarios, we performed experiments in a Ca2+-free solution prior to supplement of 2 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 1B, top bar). Therefore, the initial Ca2+ spike represents the Ca2+ release from the intracellular store, and the subsequent [Ca2+]i elevation after the supplementation of 2 mm Ca2+ reflects the Ca2+ influx via CRAC. As seen in Fig. 1B, OKT3-stimulated J.Vav1 cells presented a delayed and attenuated spike of [Ca2+]i in comparison with that of Jurkat and J.WT cells. Upon addition of extracellular Ca2+ (at 400 s post-stimulation), all three kinds of cells displayed a rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentration, indicating comparable Ca2+ influx capabilities in cells with or without Vav1. Thus, the abnormal [Ca2+]i profile of J.Vav1 cells is largely because of the defect of initial calcium release, suggesting that Vav1 is essential for the TCR-mediated Ca2+ release from intracellular store. The deficiency in TCR-stimulated Ca2+ release in J.Vav1 cells is thought to be the consequence of the impaired activation of PLC-γ1, represented by tyrosine phosphorylation on both Tyr-783 (38Irvin B.J. Williams B.L. Nilson A.E. Maynor H.O. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9149-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and Tyr-775 residues (39Serrano C.J. Graham L. DeBell K. Rawat R. Veri M.C. Bonvini E. Rellahan B.L. Reischl I.G. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 6233-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed, the defective tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 Tyr-783 was observed in J.Vavl cells (30Braiman A. Barda-Saad M. Sommers C.L. Samelson L.E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 774-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, when we treated J.Vav1 cells with pervanadate (PV), a potent protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, to induce PLC-γ1 phosphorylation (40Secrist J.P. Burns L.A. Karnitz L. Koretzky G.A. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5886-5893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the calcium defects still remained in J.Vav1 cells (Fig. 2A). Meanwhile, Jurkat and J.WT presented similar intracellular calcium release in response to PV, demonstrating the indispensable role that Vav1 plays in calcium release. The activation of PLC-γ1 was monitored by the phosphorylation of Tyr-783 (Fig. 2B, upper panel), and J.Vav1 displayed equal trends to that of wild type cells at 2, 5, and 10 min post-induction by PV (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Considering that both N- and C-SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 were shown to be dispensable for PV-induced phosphorylation (41Stoica B. DeBell K.E. Graham L. Rellahan B.L. Alava M.A. Laborda J. Bonvini E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1059-1066PubMed Google Scholar), the remarkable defect of calcium release seen in J.Vav1 cells was independent of PLC-γ1 activation. The possible explanation is that Vav1 may bear other machineries to regulate Ca2+ mobilization in addition and in parallel to facilitating PLC-γ1 phosphorylation. This result was supported by our previous observation in which defect calcium profiles were seen in J.Vav1 despite normal IP3 production comparable with that of Jurkat (18Cao Y. Janssen E.M. Duncan A.W. Altman A. Billadeau D.D. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4809-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, Vav1 is prerequisite to ensure a normal calcium release upon TCR-induced PLC-γ1 activation and IP3 production. vav1-null Cells Possess Intact Intracellular Calcium Store and IP3R-1 Expression—Because J.Vav1 cells are derived from the Jurkat E6 cell line by the gene targeting approach, the possibility should be noted that J.Vav1 cells have disrupted calcium store or gene expression, which can lead to the abnormal calcium signals observed above. Thus, we inspected the intracellular calcium stores and calcium channel expression of ER. ER calcium pools were measured indirectly by treating cells with a known inhibitor of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pumps, thapsigargin (TG), which causes passive calcium depletion from the ER lumen into the cytoplasm. As presented in Fig. 3A, the magnitude of TG-releasable calcium in J.Vav1 cells resembled that of Jurkat and J.WT cells. Moreover, the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, evoked the same calcium release patterns in cells with or without Vav1 (data not shown), indicating the equal calcium stores in J.Vav1, Jurkat, and J.WT cells. Considering IP3R-1 as a predominant player in IP3-induced calcium release in T lymphocytes (20Jayaraman T. Ondriasova E. Ondrias K. Harnick D.J. Marks A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6007-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we also confirmed its expression level in J.Vav1 cells. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 3B, the same IP3R-1 expression levels were observed in all the three cell lines, with equal protein loading verified by Zap-70 (lower panel) and α-tubulin (not shown). Moreover, proteomics analysis showed no detectable differences in proteins that related to calcium signaling between J.Vav1 cells and Jurkat cells. 3J. Yin and Y. Cao, unpublished data. Hence, the loss of Vav1 had no effect on ER calcium content nor on IP3R-1 expression, pinpointing the function of Vav1 in the course of TCR-induced calcium release rather than interfering with the intracellular Ca2+ store or protein expression. Vav1 Interacts with Calmodulin via CH Domain in a Ca2+-dependent and Activation-independent Manner—To explore the possible mechanisms that Vav1 modulates calcium release, we looked for Vav1 binding partners. CaM came to the scene as it was demonstrated to ubiquitously bind and regulate IP3R (29Kasri N.N. Torok K. Galione A. Garnham C. Callewaert G. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De S.H. J. Biol.

CaM pulldown assay was performed by incubating CaM-conjugated agarose with cell lysates of Jurkat or J.Vav1, respectively, or using plain agarose beads as a negative control. The pulldown contents were resolved by immunoblot with anti-Vav1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, Vav1 can be precipitated by CaM-conjugated agarose but not control agarose from Jurkat lysates. The binding was selective for Vav1, as incubation with J.Vav1 lysates was negative (Fig. 4A, 2nd from left). Total protein input was presented in the rightmost lane of Fig. 4A. The binding specificity was confirmed by competition assays in which increasing amounts of purified CaM were added to the pulldown mixture containing eukaryotically overexpressed Vav1 (Fig. 4B, left). In the competition experiment, decreased amounts of Vav1 were pulled down in the presence of 20 μg of CaM, and the Vav1 band turned undetectable when 50 μg of CaM was added to compete the binding. Meanwhile, Ca2+ dependence of Vav1-CaM association was also characterized. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 4B, Vav1 binds to CaM in the presence of external Ca2+, whereas chelating agent EGTA completely abolished the interaction, indicating that the association between Vav1 and CaM is Ca2+-dependent. To examine if Vav1 endogenously interacts with calmodulin, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments. As shown in Fig. 4C, co-IP performed with anti-Vav1 antibody showed the co-precipitation with CaM from lysates of both Jurkat cells and primary lymphocytes (Fig. 4C, lower panel, 1st and 2nd lanes). Likewise, co-IP using anti-CaM antibody displayed Vav1 from Jurkat and primary lymphocytes (Fig. 4C, upper panel, 5th and 6th lanes). J.Vav1 cell lysate was used in both cases as a vav1-null control (Fig. 4C, 3rd and 7th lanes), and preimmune IgG was applied as negative control (lane labeled IgG).The total protein input was shown as indicated (Fig. 4C, lysate). These data show that the endogenous CaM and Vav1 associate in vivo. Tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Vav1 are early events in TCR engagement; therefore, we asked if Vav1-CaM interaction is modulated by the activation status of T cells. Jurkat cells were treated with solvent only, OKT3, or OKT3 plus anti-CD28 IgM as co-signal ligand, res"

This report investigates the detailed mechanisms of GATA-4 nuclear transport. We characterized a nonclassical nuclear localization signal between amino acids 270 and 324 that actively transports GATA-4 into the nucleus of both HeLa cells and cardiac myocytes. Fine mapping studies revealed four crucial arginine residues within this region that mediate active transport predominately through the nonclassical pathway via interaction with importin β. These four residues were also essential for the DNA binding activity of GATA-4 and transcriptional activation of cardiac-specific genes. Interestingly, mutation of these residues not only inhibited DNA binding and gene transcription but also resulted in a preferential accumulation of the GATA-4 protein in distinct subnuclear speckles. A cardiac myocyte-specific, chromosome maintenance region 1-dependent nuclear export signal consisting of three essential leucine residues was also identified. The current study provides detailed information on the nuclear shuttling pathways of GATA-4 that represents an additional mechanism of gene regulation.

The current study provides detailed information on the nuclear shuttling pathways of GATA-4 that represents an additional mechanism of gene regulation. The heart is the first organ to form during embryogenesis. It arises through a complex process that requires cooperative interactions between various cytokines and specific transcription factors such as GATA-4 (1Zaffran S. Frasch M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). GATA-4 is a cardiac-specific member of the GATA family of zinc finger transcription factors (2Huang W.Y. Cukerman E. Liew C.C. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Members of this family contain two conserved type IV zinc finger motifs of the distinctive form Cys-Xaa2-Cys-Xaa17-Cys-Xaa2-Cys (3Evans T. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1989; 58: 877-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). These fingers recognize and bind a consensus sequence known as the “GATA” motif (A/T(GATA)A/G), present in the transcriptional regulatory regions of a plethora of cardiac-specific genes (4Ko L.J. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4011-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). GATA-4 is considered one of the earliest markers of cardiac myocyte commitment and has been shown to be essential for normal heart formation, with GATA-4 knockout mice dying between 8.5 and 10.5 days postcoitum and displaying profound abnormalities in ventral morphogenesis and heart tube formation (5Kuo C.T. Morrisey E.E. Anandappa R. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Soudais C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1048-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RNA-inducible inhibition of GATA-4 in the P19 embryonic stem cell line showed diminished activation of cardiac-specific genes and a resulting decrease in expression of cardiac muscle markers and cardiac myocyte differentiation (6Grepin C. Robitaille L. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4095-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast, ectopic expression of GATA-4 in P19 cells led to a 10-fold increase in the number of terminally differentiated beating cardiac myocytes (7Grepin C. Nemer G. Nemer M. Development. 1997; 124: 2387-2395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of GATA-4 can also have detrimental effects on the developed heart such as induction of cardiac hypertrophy (8Saadane N. Alpert L. Chalifour L.E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Hence, considering the need for precise regulation of GATA-4 in both heart development and normal cardiac function, it is essential that we define the molecular pathways regulating GATA-4 activity, one of which is nuclear shuttling.Like all nuclear proteins, GATA-4 is synthesized in the cytoplasm and must be imported into the nucleus to perform its transcriptional function. This nucleocytoplasmic transport across the nuclear envelope occurs via the nuclear pore complex (NPC) 4The abbreviations used are: NPCnuclear pore complexBNPbrain natriuretic peptideCRM1chromosome maintenance region 1DBDDNA-binding domainFLfull-lengthGFPgreen fluorescent proteinLMBleptomycin BncNLSnonclassical nuclear localization signalNESnuclear export signalNLSnuclear localization signalsiRNAsmall interference RNAGSTglutathione S-transferaseEMSAelectromobility shift assayaaamino acids 4The abbreviations used are: NPCnuclear pore complexBNPbrain natriuretic peptideCRM1chromosome maintenance region 1DBDDNA-binding domainFLfull-lengthGFPgreen fluorescent proteinLMBleptomycin BncNLSnonclassical nuclear localization signalNESnuclear export signalNLSnuclear localization signalsiRNAsmall interference RNAGSTglutathione S-transferaseEMSAelectromobility shift assayaaamino acids (9Feldherr C.M. Kallenbach E. Schultz N. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2216-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Small molecules can passively diffuse through the NPC, whereas larger molecules are actively transported in and out of the nucleus. This active transport process requires nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins known as importins and exportins (10Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar) that recognize nuclear localization signals (NLS) (11Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar, 12Dingwall C. Sharnick S.V. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1982; 30: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and nuclear export signals (NES) (13Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), respectively. NLSs are sequences that are necessary and sufficient to allow a protein to be targeted to the nucleus. Although there is not a strict consensus sequence, classical NLSs are typically small stretches of positively charged amino acids, arranged as either monopartite (a single cluster) or bipartite (two clusters separated by a 10–12-amino acid spacer) sequences (14Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 15Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). NESs, however, allow a protein to be exported from the nucleus and are characteristically short stretches of leucine-rich and hydrophobic amino acids (16Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). The import of substrates with a classical NLS is mediated by the classical pathway whereby importin α binds the NLS-containing protein in the cytoplasm. Importin β then binds to importin α, forming a trimeric complex (17Adam S.A. Gerace L. Cell. 1991; 66: 837-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). This complex is then translocated through the NPC by transient importin β-mediated interactions with nucleoporins (18Bayliss R. Corbett A.H. Stewart M. Traffic. 2000; 1: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Once in the nucleus, RanGTP binds to importin β, dissociating it from importin α and the NLS-containing protein (19Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Importin α then dissociates from the NLS cargo in the presence of the export receptor cellular apoptosis susceptibility gene (CAS) (20Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Gorlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The importins are then recycled back to the cytoplasm for another round of transport, leaving the NLS-containing protein in the nucleus to perform its function.Although certain classes of proteins are imported via this classical pathway, studies have identified several types of nonclassical pathways that do not require importin α for NLS recognition (21Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). In this case, the NLS of the target protein can either interact directly with the nucleoporins of the NPC (22Matsubayashi Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41755-41760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) or interact with one of the many homologues of importin β for translocation into the nucleus (23Palmeri D. Malim M.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1218-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Although nucleocytoplasmic transport is an important regulator in the biological activity of GATA-4 as a transcription factor, it is unknown which amino acid residues of GATA-4 serve as signals for its nucleocytoplasmic transport and which pathways it utilizes. In this study we elucidated that GATA-4 contains a cardiac-specific, CRM1-dependent NES, with three leucine residues essential for export. We also identified a functional NLS in the DNA-binding domain (DBD). This NLS facilitates nuclear import predominately via the nonclassical pathway through interaction with importin β and RanGTP. Mutational analyses led to the identification of a group of four positively charged residues that are crucial for nuclear import, forming a platform for interaction with importin β. We also identified the DNA-binding residues involved in the activity of GATA-4. Mutation of these residues not only abolished DNA binding activity and transcriptional activation of cardiac-specific genes but surprisingly was also associated with an intranuclear accumulation of the mutant GATA-4 protein in speckles. Furthermore, we demonstrated that DNA molecules containing GATA-binding sites and the presence of RanGTP effectively compete with importin β for binding the GATA-4 DBD, suggesting that DNA binding and RanGTP play a role in the release of importins for recycling back to the cytoplasm.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Mouse full-length GATA-4 (accession number NM_008092) and deletion fragments were subcloned into: pDEST53 and pDEST47 vectors for N- and C-terminal GFP fusion, respectively; pDEST15 vector for C-terminal GST fusion; and pAd/CMV/V5-DEST vector for adenoviral gene delivery (Gateway Technology; Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) promoter region was cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter in the pGL3Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The importin α (PTAC58) subunit and importin β (PTAC97) subunit cloned into the pGEX2T vector were kindly donated by Yoshihiro Yoneda (Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). Nup62 in the pcDNA3.1/HisB vector and Nup153 in the pET28b vector were generous gifts from Professor N. Yaseen (Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL).Cell Culture—Human embryonal kidney 293A cells were obtained from Invitrogen. Human HeLa cervical carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Primary cultures of beating neonatal myocardial cells were isolated from 2–3-day-old rats as previously described (57Kwok J.C. Richardson D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 58Terman A. Brunk U.T. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1998; 100: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, the rat hearts were isolated and digested in the presence of 0.05% collagenase type II (Worthington Biochemicals, Freehold NJ). Differential plating was performed to purify cardiac myocytes from other cell types such as fibroblasts. The cells were then subjected to red blood cell lysis. 1 × 105 cells were plated onto collagen-coated coverslips (BD Biosciences, Sydney, Australia). All of the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. 293A cells were also supplemented with 4.5 g/liter of d-glucose (Sigma).Transient Cell Transfection—HeLa cells were grown on coverslips at 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. The following day the cells were transiently transfected with 1.2–2 μg of GATA-4-GFP expression vectors using Lipofectamine or Lipofectamine 2000 as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 48 h after transfection and analyzed with an Olympus confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 600× magnification. The images were acquired using Olympus Fluoview software, version 4.3, FV300 (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd.).Adenoviral Transduction and Antibody Staining—Viral supernatant was produced using 293A cells as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cardiac myocytes were serum-starved for 24 h and transduced for a further 24 h with an equal number of viral particles (multiplicity of infection of 25) derived from the pAd-LacZ or pAd-GATA-4 constructs. Viral supernatant was replaced with fresh serum-free medium, and the cells were cultured for 24 h. The cells were then fixed in 100% methanol. Following blocking with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were stained with anti-α-actinin monoclonal antibody (A7811; Sigma; 1:800 dilution) for 45 min. The secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 594 (A-11020; Invitrogen; 1:500 dilution) was applied for 45 min. This was followed by the addition of an anti-V5-fluorescein isothiocyanate monoclonal antibody (R963-25; Invitrogen; 1:500 dilution) for 45 min. After each antibody incubation the slides were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The coverslips were mounted onto the slides using glycerol (Sigma), and the cells were viewed with an Olympus confocal microscope. For nuclear export studies, the transduced cells were treated with 7.5 ng/ml leptomycin B (LMB) for 5 h prior to fixing.GST Pull-down Assay—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Promega) as formerly described (59Hu W. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15820-15827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled GATA-4, deletion constructs, and mutants were in vitro translated using the TnT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. GST pull-down assays were performed as previously detailed (36Hu W. Philips A.S. Kwok J.C. Eisbacher M. Chong B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3087-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For Ran studies (see Fig. 5B), 0.9 μm RanGDP or RanGTP (Ran Q69L, a dominant GTP form of Ran; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was added. For DNA competition studies (see Fig. 10), 200 ng of BNP probe or scrambled BNP probe was added.FIGURE 10DNA target sites effectively compete with importinβ for binding to the DBD of GATA-4. TnT-synthesized 35S-GATA-4 was generated and allowed to interact with GST-importin β in the absence of DNA (lane 2), in the presence of the BNP promoter DNA probe (lane 3) or in the presence of the scrambled (scr) BNP promoter DNA probe (lane 4). The interaction was determined using the pull-down assay. Lane 1 contains 10% input of 35S-GATA-4 protein. The GATA-4/importin β interaction was greatly reduced in the presence of GATA-specific DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)siRNA Transfection—Small interfering RNA molecules (siRNAs) corresponding to exon 3 and exon 9 of human importin β (catalogue number 16707, siRNA identification codes 11125 and 145041, respectively) were obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). A negative control no. 1 (catalogue number 4611) was also purchased.Transfection of siRNA was performed using siPORT NeoFX (Ambion) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2.3 × 105 HeLa cells were transfected with 30 nm siRNA and 5 μlof NeoFX reagent for 48 h. The cells were subsequently transfected with the GATA-4-GFP expression vector using Lipofectamine 2000, as previously described. After 24 h, the cells were harvested, and nuclear localization of GATA-4 was examined using confocal microscopy.Western blot analyses were performed to assess importin β knockdown 48 and 72 h after siRNA transfection using an anti-importin β antibody (sc-1863; Santa Cruz, CA; 1:200 dilution). Equal protein loading was measured by Ponceau S staining.Luciferase Assay and Western Blot Analysis—HeLa cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. The following day the cells were transiently transfected with 200 ng of the BNP reporter plasmid together with 800 ng of wild type or mutant GATA-4 expression vectors using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was assessed using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 0.5× passive lysis buffer (Promega) containing complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Luciferase activity was measured using the TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). To confirm that GATA-4 protein was expressed in transiently transfected cells, Western blot analysis was carried out as previously described (57Kwok J.C. Richardson D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The membranes were probed using a goat anti-GATA-4 antibody (sc-1237; Santa Cruz; 1:500 dilution), followed by an anti-goat antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (P 0449; DAKO, Denmark; 1:5000 dilution). Protein was detected using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence reagent plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in conjunction with exposure to CL-Xposure Film (Quantum Scientific, murarrie, QLD, Australia).Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The double-stranded DNA probe (ATG CAG CTG ATA AAT CAG AGA) containing a GATA-binding site (in bold type) was selected from the promoter of mouse BNP and end-labeled with [32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences) by polynucleotide enzyme as previously described (36Hu W. Philips A.S. Kwok J.C. Eisbacher M. Chong B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3087-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Wild type GATA-4 and its mutants were in vitro translated using the TnT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) and allowed to bind to the mBNP probe (2 × 105 cpm) for 30 min. The samples were then incubated for 30 min with a goat anti-GATA-4 antibody (sc-1237; Santa Cruz; 1:50 dilution) for supershift studies. The samples were loaded onto a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and dried, and autoradiography was performed. To ensure equal expression of the in vitro translated protein, parallel experiments were performed with [35S]methionine. These samples were boiled in the presence of 20% β-mercaptoethanol, electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR-1 x-ray film (GE Healthcare Bioscience).RESULTSClassification of the GATA-4 NLS—The GATA-4 DBD consists of two zinc finger motifs and two adjacent stretches of basic amino acids (aa 216–324) (24Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry Q08369) (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, it contains three transcriptional activation domains: two N-terminal independent domains (aa 1–74 and 130–177) and one C-terminal domain that is required for transcriptional activity of the native protein but is insufficient to independently activate transcription (25Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8515-8524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A).FIGURE 1Identification of a single NLS in the cardiac-specific GATA-4 gene.

FL GATA-4 (panels i and ii) and various GATA-4 deletion fragments (panels iii–xi) were fused to either an N- or C-terminal GFP tag.

The minimal region containing a functional NLS isaa 270–324.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To identify the region of GATA-4 that contains an NLS and is therefore responsible for its nuclear import, full-length GATA-4 and various GATA-4 deletion fragments were fused upstream or downstream of GFP (Fig. 1B). GFP alone (27 kDa) does not contain an NLS and can travel freely between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (26Ogawa H. Inouye S. Tsuji F.I. Yasuda K. Umesono K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11899-11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 27Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3448-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Hence, a GFP construct was used as a negative control. These constructs were transiently transfected into HeLa cells, and the intracellular localization of the fusion proteins was analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1C).As shown in Fig. 1C, GFP alone (Mock) is evenly distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating the absence of an active NLS. Full-length GATA-4 fused to GFP at either the C or N terminus (Fig. 1B, panels i and ii) were expressed and actively targeted to the nucleus (Fig. 1C, panels i and ii), suggesting the presence of an intact and functional NLS. Removal of the C-terminal activation domain (Fig. 1B, panel iii), of the N-terminal activation domains (Fig. 1B, panel vi), or of all activation domains (Fig. 1B, panel vii) had no effect on nuclear localization, with all three GATA-4-GFP fragments being actively targeted to the nucleus (Fig. 1C, panels iii, vi, and vii). Furthermore, the N- and C-terminal fragments of GATA-4 (Fig. 1B, panels iv and v) were insufficient to direct nuclear accumulation independently (Fig. 1C, panels iv and v). Indeed, of the deletion constructs generated, only those that contain the C-terminal zinc finger and adjacent basic domain (aa 270–324) (Fig. 1B, panels iii, vi, vii, ix, and x) were found to be targeted to the nucleus, similar to full-length GATA-4 (Fig. 1C, panels iii, vi, vii, ix, and x). Therefore, the minimal domain that contains an intact NLS and is thus responsible for active nuclear import of GATA-4 was determined to be from amino acids 270–324 (Fig. 1, B and C, panel x). To further confirm this finding, deletion of this region in the full-length GATA-4 (Fig. 1B, panel xi) showed complete loss of actively transported protein to the nucleus (Fig. 1C, panel xi).From these experiments, it can be ascertained that the C-terminal zinc finger and adjacent basic domain (aa 270–324) is sufficient for complete nuclear localization of GATA-4. Unexpectedly, those GATA-4 constructs that did not contain an NLS were detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Because none of the fragments were excluded from the nucleus, it suggested that either GATA-4 does not contain an NES or the NES is not functional in HeLa cells.To determine whether the zinc finger structure of GATA-4 was involved in its nuclear import, GATA-4 C270A + C273A was produced by mutation of the cysteine residues to alanine, thus effectively destroying the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA-4. This had no effect on the ability of GATA-4 to be targeted to the nucleus (data not shown).Individual Mutations of the Positively Charged Amino Acids in the GATA-4 NLS Are Insufficient to Inhibit Nuclear Localization—To determine the specific amino acid residues necessary for the nuclear import of GATA-4, point mutations were introduced into the full-length GATA-4 to change the positively charged residues, arginine and lysine, typically involved in NLS, into the neutral amino acid alanine (Fig. 2A). The following mutants in GATA-4 were generated: R282A, R283A, K299A, R305A, R310A, K311A, R317A, K318A, R319A, K320A, and K322A. These GFP fusion constructs were transiently transfected into HeLa cells, and the intracellular localization of the fusion proteins were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Single mutations are insufficient to inhibit nuclear import. A, sequence of the putative NLS. The positively charged residues arginine and lysine (in bold type) were mutated into alanine using site-directed mutagenesis (indicated by the arrows). B, mutant constructs were transfected into HeLa cells and nuclear localization examined. GFP nuclear accumulation is observed in all single mutants. C, enlarged image of wild type GATA-4 and the mutant R282A that accumulated preferentially in subnuclear speckles (indicated by the arrows).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Of the 11 single point mutant constructs transfected, none had the ability to inhibit nuclear targeting of GATA-4-GFP, as observed by exclusive localization of GFP in the nucleus (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, it was noted that several of the mutant proteins, in particular R282A, R283A, K299A, R305A, and R317A, accumulated preferentially in subnuclear speckles (Fig. 2, B and C).Multiple Mutations Are Required to Inhibit Nuclear Import of GATA-4—Because single mutations had no effect on nuclear localization of GATA-4, the NLS region was examined for clusters of positively charged amino acids. Three clusters (similar to classical NLS clusters) were identified: cluster 1 consisting of two adjacent residues, Arg282 and Arg283; cluster 2 also consisting of two adjacent residues, Arg310 and Lys311; and cluster 3 consisting of five residues, Arg317, Arg318, Arg319, Arg320, and Arg322. Multiple mutations were made, and nuclear localization was examined (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Simultaneous mutation of residues Arg282, Arg283, Arg317, and Arg319 in the GATA-4 NLS is required for complete inhibition of nuclear import. Constructs containing mutations of clusters of positively charged residues were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutant constructs were transfected into HeLa cells, and their intracellular location was examined using confocal microscopy. Simultaneous mutation of clusters 1 and 3 and more specifically, simultaneous mutation of residues Arg282, Arg283, Arg317, and Arg319 abolished nuclear localization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mutation of each of the individual clusters was insufficient to inhibit nuclear targeting of GATA-4, with the protein still accumulating in the nucleus of HeLa cells (Fig. 3, panels i–iii). Likewise, simultaneously mutating both clusters 2 and 3, and clusters 1 and 2 had no effect on GATA-4 nuclear localization (Fig. 3, panel iv, and data not shown). In contrast, mutating both clusters 1 and 3 simultaneously abolished nuclear import, resulting in diffuse staining throughout the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, panel v). To further fine map the exact amino acids involved, many combinations of the seven mutants in clusters 1 and 3 were generated (Fig. 3, panels vi and vii, and data not shown for other mutants). Simultaneous mutation of one amino acid from both clusters 1 and 3 was inadequate to abolish nuclear localization of GATA-4 (Fig. 3, panel vi). However, only simultaneous mutation of R282A + R283A (from cluster 1), together with mutation of R317A + R319A (from cluster 3) was sufficient for complete inhibition of GATA-4 nuclear import (Fig. 3, panels vii). Hence, amino acids Arg282, Arg283, Arg317, and Arg319 are crucial for nuclear localization of GATA-4.Intracellular Localization of GATA-4 Constructs and Mutants in Cardiac Myocytes—The above nuclear localization experiments we"

Here we show by phylogenetic analysis that there are at least six genes encoding gelsolin-like proteins based on their gelsolin domains in zebrafish: gsna and gsnb group with the vertebrate gelsolin gene, scina and scinb group with the scinderin (adseverin) gene, and scinla (C/L-gelsolin) and scinlb are novel scinderin-like genes. RT-PCR showed that scinla, scinlb, and gsnb are preferentially expressed in the adult cornea whereas gsna is expressed to a similar extent in cornea, lens, brain, and heart; scina and scinb expression were detectable only in whole zebrafish and not in these adult tissues. Quantitative RT-PCR and 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by MALDI/TOF mass spectroscopy confirmed high expression of beta-actin and scinla, moderate expression of scinlb, and very low expression of gsna and gsnb in the cornea. Finally, transgenic zebrafish carrying a green fluorescent protein reporter transgene driven by a 4 kb scinla promoter fragment showed expression in the cornea, snout, dorsal fin, and tail fin of 3-day-old zebrafish larvae. Our data suggest that scinla and scinlb are diverged paralogs of the vertebrate scinderin gene and show that scinla encodes the zebrafish corneal crystallin previously called C/L-gelsolin."

The βγ subunit of the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (Gβγ) was found to mediate UV-induced p38 activation via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, it is not known how Gβγ mediates the UVB-induced activation of EGFR, and thus we undertook this study to elucidate the mechanism. Treatment of HaCaT-immortalized human keratinocytes with conditioned medium obtained from UVB-irradiated cells induced the phosphorylations of EGFR, p38, and ERK but not that of JNK. Blockade of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) by neutralizing antibody or CRM197 toxin inhibited the UVB-induced activations of EGFR, p38, and ERK in normal human epidermal keratinocytes and in HaCaT cells. Treatment with HB-EGF also activated EGFR, p38, and ERK. UVB radiation stimulated the processing of pro-HB-EGF and increased the secretion of soluble HB-EGF in medium, which was quantified by immunoblotting and protein staining. In addition, treatment with CRM179 toxin blocked UV-induced apoptosis, but HB-EGF augmented this apoptosis. Moreover, UVB-induced apoptosis was reduced by inhibiting EGFR or p38. The overexpression of Gβ1γ2 increased EGFR-activating activity and soluble HB-EGF content in conditioned medium, but the sequestration of Gβγ by the carboxyl terminus of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2ct) produced the opposite effect. The activation of Src increased UVB-induced, Gβγ-mediated HB-EGF secretion, but the inhibition of Src blocked that. Overexpression of Gβγ increased UVB-induced apoptosis, and the overexpression of GRK2ct decreased this apoptosis. We conclude that Gβγ mediates UVB-induced human keratinocyte apoptosis by augmenting the ectodomain shedding of HB-EGF, which sequentially activates EGFR and p38.

Skin cancer is the most common human cancer, and UV radiation in sunlight is a major etiologic factor (1Kraemer K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is becoming increasingly apparent that its physiological and pathological effects can result from various UV-induced signaling events in distinct epidermal cell populations that lead to changes in patterns of gene expression, lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and apoptosis (3Schwarz T.

One mechanism of triggering signal transduction by UV radiation involves the release of growth factors and cytokines (6Gahring L. Baltz M. Pepys M.B. Daynes R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dong Z. Sci. STKE 2003. 2003; : RE2Google Scholar).The MAPKs are serine/threonine kinases and are composed of at least four distinct subfamilies, the ERKs, p38 kinases, JNKs, and ERK5/BMK1. The ERKs are activated by growth factors and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists, and the stress-activated kinases, p38 and JNK, are activated by cellular stressors, such as UV irradiation, osmotic shock, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokines (10Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Moreover, the activation of MAPKs may result in their translocations to the nucleus, where they activate transcription factors by phosphorylation, which in turn leads to changes in gene expression and to the induction of various cellular responses, e.g. proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis (11Lenormand P.

HB-EGF is expressed as a membrane-anchored precursor protein (pro-HB-EGF) (13Higashiyama S. Lau K. Besner G.E. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6205-6212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the extracellular domain of pro-HB-EGF is cleaved and released as a soluble HB-EGF (sHB-EGF) by a metalloprotease-mediated process called “ectodomain shedding” (14Goishi K.

The ectodomain shedding of pro-HB-EGF is induced by exposure to various stimuli, e.g. UV radiation, GPCR ligands, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, lysophosphatidic acid, oxidative or osmotic stress, or inflammatory cytokines (14Goishi K.

HB-EGF is known to have mitogenic activity and to play critical roles in a number of physiologic and pathologic processes, such as wound healing, cardiac hypertrophy, smooth muscle cell hyperplasia, and oncogenic transformation (17Marikovsky M.

Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). GPCR activated by agonist binding stimulates the exchange of GDP with GTP in the α subunit of G proteins (Gα), and this leads to the activation and dissociation of Gα from the βγ subunit of G proteins (Gβγ) (21Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar). These activated Gα and Gβγ subunits regulate the activities of various effector molecules, including adenylyl cyclases, phospholipases, phosphodiesterases, ion channels, and MAPKs (22Neer E.J.

However, it is unclear how Gβγ mediates the UVB-induced activations of EGFR and MAPKs. Thus, in this study we investigated the mechanism whereby Gβγ mediates the UV-induced activations of EGFR and MAPKs and its physiological significance. From this study, Gβγ was found to mediate UVB-induced ectodomain shedding of HB-EGF to activate EGFR and MAPKs, which resulted in UVB-induced apoptosis in human keratinocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Recombinant human HB-EGF was purchased from R&D Systems, and manumycin A, AG1478, PP2, and PP3 were from Calbiochem.Expression Plasmids—The expression plasmids for the β and γ2 subunits of G protein and for the carboxyl terminus of GRK2 were subcloned into pcDNA3 expression vector (25Seo M.

Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) were obtained from human foreskin and cultured as described previously (26Boyce S.T. Ham R.G. J. Investig.

Proteins on blots were visualized by incubation with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate mixture (Pierce) and then exposed to x-ray film (AGFA Curix RPI). Densities of visualized bands were quantified using an image analyzer (Fujifilm, model MultiGauge version 2.3), and relative band densities were expressed as percentages of the corresponding band densities in UVB-irradiated cells. For co-immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. The precleared lysates were incubated with 2 μgof antibody against GRK2 overnight at 4 °C. The beads were centrifuged, washed three times, and subjected to immunoblot analysis.Activity Assays of Ras, Cdc42, and Rac1—Ras activity was assayed by analyzing the binding of activated Ras to the Ras binding domain of Raf-1 and the activities of Cdc42 and Rac1 by analyzing the bindings of the activated proteins to the Cdc42/Rac binding domain of p21-activated kinase (amino acid residues 67–150) fused to glutathione-Sepharose (24Seo M.

The lyophilized medium was solubilized in distilled water and then desalted by ultrafiltration (Centricon 3, Amicon). Desalted samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by silver staining (Invitrogen) or by Western blotting using sHB-EGF antibody. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HB-EGF was developed to measure sHB-EGF. In brief, the conditioned medium (1 ml) from UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells was incubated with heparin beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. The reaction mixture was incubated with anti-sHB-EGF antibody (R&D Systems) at room temperature for 2 h and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG was then added and incubated for 1 h. The peroxidase reaction was allowed for 15 min by addition of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution in H2O2/citric acid buffer (Pierce). The reaction was stopped by adding 2 m H2SO4, and the absorbance of supernatant was measured at 450 nm. The concentration of sHB-EGF was calculated from a standard curve and normalized by cell numbers.Data Analysis—At least four independent experiments were conducted for all analyses. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze mean values, and p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSGβγ Augmented the Activity That Phosphorylates EGFR, p38, and ERK in the Conditioned Medium from UVB-irradiated Cells—To identify the molecule that mediates the UVB-induced activations of EGFR and MAPKs, conditioned medium from UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells was examined to determine whether it could activate EGFR and MAPKs of nonirradiated cells, because UV irradiation is known to release various growth factors and cytokines that can activate EGFR (16Takenobu H. Yamazaki A. Hirata M. Umata T. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17255-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Ellem K.A. Cullinan M. Baumann K.C. Dunstan A. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 9: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Treatment of nonirradiated HaCaT cells with the conditioned medium obtained from UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells induced the phosphorylations of EGFR, p38, and ERK but not that of JNK, in contrast to UVB, which induced the phosphorylations of all three MAPKs, including JNK (Fig. 1A). This result shows that that the conditioned medium contains molecules that can activate EGFR and p38, indicating that UVB radiation induces the secretion of EGFR- and p38-activating factors into conditioned medium.To confirm that EGFR- and p38-activating factors in the conditioned medium from UVB-irradiated cells may mediate UV-induced p38 activation, we examined whether p38 activation induced by conditioned medium also requires the activations of EGFR and Ras, because EGFR and Ras were found to mediate UV-induced p38 activation in a previous study (24Seo M. Cho C.H. Lee Y.I. Shin E.Y. Park D. Bae C.D. Lee J.W. Lee E.S. Juhnn Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17366-17375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Pretreating HaCaT cells with AG-1478, an EGFR inhibitor, or manumycin A, a Ras inhibitor, significantly reduced p38 activation by conditioned medium (53.5 ± 3.1% and 63.8 ± 2.1%, respectively, p = 0.037, Mann-Whitney) (Fig. 1B). This result indicates that EGFR and Ras are also involved in p38 activation by conditioned medium from UVB-irradiated cells, as in p38 activation by UVB irradiation, suggesting the EGFR- and p38-activating factors in the conditioned medium may mediate UV-induced p38 activation.G protein βγ subunits were found to mediate the UV-induced EGFR and p38 activations in a previous study (24Seo M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 17366-17375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and thus we examined the effects of Gβγ on EGFR- and p38-activating activity in conditioned medium obtained from UVB-irradiated cells. The overexpression of Gβ1γ2 augmented the activations of EGFR (133.0 ± 14.3%, p = 0.029) and p38 (173.5 ± 13.8%, p = 0.008) in UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells (Fig. 1C), and the conditioned medium from Gβ1γ2 -overexpressing cells increased the activations of EGFR (126.6 ± 4.8%, p = 0.029) and p38 (147.7 ± 5.6%, p = 0.029) when added to nonirradiated cells versus the conditioned medium from vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1D). Conversely, the expression of the carboxyl terminus of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2ct), which sequesters free Gβγ, attenuated UV-induced EGFR (74.2 ± 9.0%, p = 0.029) and p38 activations (65.0 ± 7.2%, p = 0.008), and the conditioned medium from GRK2ct-transfected cells showed reduced activations of EGFR (88.4 ± 3.1%, p = 0.029) and p38 (70.1 ± 3.6%, p = 0.029) compared with that of the vector-transfected control (Fig. 1, C and D). The result indicates that Gβγ augments the activity that phosphorylates EGFR and p38 in the conditioned medium from UVB-irradiated cells. Furthermore, pretreatment of HaCaT cells with pertussis toxin that blocks activation of inhibitory G proteins, including Gαis, also partially inhibited UVB-induced activations of EGFR (55.1 ± 6.3%, p = 0.029) and p38 (44.1 ± 2.4%, p = 0.029) (Fig. 1E), which confirms that G proteins, including Gβγ subunits, are involved in UVB-induced EGFR and p38 activation. However, the incomplete inhibition by pertussis toxin suggests that there are other factors to mediate UVB-induced EGFR and p38 activations besides G proteins.HB-EGF Induced the Activations of EGFR and p38 via the Same Pathway as Did UV Light—Because UV light was reported to induce ectodomain shedding of pro-HB-EGF and thus the release of sHB-EGF, which is known to phosphorylate EGFR to elicit various cellular responses (16Takenobu H. Yamazaki A. Hirata M. Umata T. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17255-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), sHB-EGF was examined to determine its involvement in UVB-induced p38 activation. First, the effects of pretreating with a mutant of diphtheria toxin, CRM197, a HB-EGF specific inhibitor, or with HB-EGF-neutralizing antibody on UVB-induced MAPK activation were examined. Pretreatment of HaCaT cells with CRM197 or HB-EGF-neutralizing antibody inhibited UVB-induced p38 and ERK activations in HaCaT cells (Fig. 2A), and similar effects of CRM197 were observed in primary cultured NHEKs (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, pretreatment of the conditioned medium with CRM197 toxin attenuated the conditioned medium-induced activation of EGFR and p38 (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Mediation of UVB-induced MAPK activation by sHB-EGF in NHEKs and HaCaT cells.

HaCaT cells (A) and NHEKs (B) were pretreated with 10 μg/ml of CRM197 or 20 μg/ml of neutralizing antibody against HB-EGF for 30 min, and then irradiated with 60 mJ/cm2 of UVB light. After 60 min of incubation, the cells were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis against phosphorylated EGFR, p38, and ERK. The conditioned medium obtained from UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells was pretreated 10 μg/ml of CRM197, and then incubated with HaCaT cells (C). Other HaCaT cells were treated with 20 ng/ml of sHB-EGF or irradiated with 60mJ/cm2 of UVB light and then incubated for 60 min. The treated cells were harvested and subjected to Western blotting analysis using antibodies against phosphorylated EGFR, p38, ERK, and JNK and for Ras, Cdc42 and Rac1 activity assays, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the mediation of UVB-induced MAPK activation by sHB-EGF, we examined the effect of sHB-EGF on MAPK activation. The treatment of HaCaT cells with sHB-EGF resulted in the activations of EGFR, p38, and ERK but not of JNK (Fig. 2D), which corresponded well to the observed effects of conditioned medium from UVB-irradiated cells on the MAPKs (Fig. 1A). Because UV-induced p38 activation was previously found to involve the sequential activations of Ras and Cdc42 (24Seo M. Cho C.H. Lee Y.I. Shin E.Y. Park D. Bae C.D. Lee J.W. Lee E.S. Juhnn Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17366-17375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), sHB-EGF was examined to determine whether it could activate Ras, Cdc42, and Rac1 during the course of p38 activation. In fact, treatment with sHB-EGF induced the activations of Ras and Cdc42 in HaCaT cells (Fig. 2D), which corresponded well to the effect of UVB radiation. However, HB-EGF did not increase Rac1 activity compare with vehicle-treated control cells or nonirradiated control cells. This result shows that sHB-EGF activates p38 by activating EGFR, Ras, and Cdc42 as does UVB irradiation and that sHB-EGF mediates the UVB-induced activations of p38 and ERK in NHEK and HaCaT cells, thus suggesting that UVB radiation induces the ectodomain shedding of pro-HB-EGF to mediate the sequential activations of EGFR, p38, and ERK.UVB Irradiation Stimulated Release of Free Gβγ, Which Augmented Ectodomain Shedding of pro-HB-EGF Induced by UVB Irradiation—Next, to validate that UVB radiation induces ectodomain shedding of pro-HB-EGF, cleavage of pro-HB-EGF after UVB irradiation was analyzed by Western blotting. UVB radiation caused the cleavage of pro-HB-EGF in a dose-dependent manner (30–180 mJ/cm2) with a concomitant increase in the phosphorylations of EGFR and p38 (Fig. 3A). To prove the secretion of sHB-EGF after UVB irradiation, conditioned medium from UVB-irradiated cells was pooled, concentrated by lyophilization, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting or protein staining. Silver-stained gels showed that the concentrated conditioned medium from UVB-irradiated cells contained more HB-EGF protein than that from mock-irradiated cells (Fig. 3B). The HB-EGF band was identified by applying purified sHB-EGF to gels as a positive control. Western blot analysis also showed that UVB radiation increased the immunoreactivity of HB-EGF in medium (Fig. 3B). A small amount of sHB-EGF was observed in nonirradiated cells, which is speculated to be due to secretion induced by the stress of incubation in serum-free conditions after mock treatment. This result proved that UVB radiation induces the ectodomain shedding of pro-HB-EGF in HaCaT cells.FIGURE 3Gβγ augmented ectodomain shedding of HB-EGF induced by UVB irradiation in HaCaT cells.

The pathway and timing of these events is poorly understood. To examine this, we introduced proline residues into regions of the N-terminal domain that become α-helical during the reorganization and changed the charge of a key residue that interacts with the RNA:DNA hybrid 5 bp upstream of the active site in the EC but not in the initiation complex.

During the initiation of transcription, RNA polymerases (RNAPs) 4The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; IC, initiation complex; EC, elongation complex; nt, nucleotide; T, template; NT, non-template; WT, wild type. must balance two opposing processes. One the one hand, the polymerase must associate tightly enough with the promoter to allow it to melt apart the two DNA strands and commence transcription. On the other, the polymerase must release the promoter and enter into a highly processive elongation phase. Competition between these two phases leads to the production of abortive transcripts in which the polymerase repeatedly tries to clear the promoter but is unable to surmount the transition barrier and releases short (abortive) RNA products (1Straney D.C.

The instability of the transcription complex during this stage is often a key point for regulation of gene expression. The process by which RNAPs make the transition from an initiation complex (IC) to an elongation complex (EC) is poorly understood. In the case of multisubunit RNAPs, this may be accompanied by release of one or more initiation factors (7Borukhov S. Nudler E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In single subunit RNAPs, such as T7 RNAP, the transition is accompanied by major conformational changes in the enzyme (8Cheetham G.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 9Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Science. 2002; 298: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 10Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The changes in T7 RNAP occur largely in the N-terminal domain (residues 1-266) and involve reorientation of a core subdomain (residues 72-151, 206-257) as a rigid body, as well as extensive refolding of other elements, including: the N-subdomain (helix C (residues 2-71)); a central flap-like subdomain (subdomain H (residues 152-205)); and the C-linker (residues 258-266) (see Fig. 1). Although structural information reveals the configuration of the complexes before and after the transition, little is known about the pathway of the reorganization or the timing of these events. T7 RNAP maintains contacts with the upstream region of the promoter until the transcript achieves a length of 8-9 nt (5Guo Q. Sousa R. J. Biol.

An important question is how the structure of the complex can accommodate the lengthening transcript while maintaining these interactions. In general, two types of models have been proposed. In the first, the transition to an EC is accompanied by a gradual reorganization of the RNAP that allows promoter contacts to be maintained as the RNA:DNA hybrid is extended from 3 bp (as observed in the IC) to 8-9 bp (as observed in the EC) (9Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Science. 2002; 298: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 10Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12709-12715Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (here and throughout this report, the hybrid length assumes that the transcription complex is in the post-translocated state). An alternative type of model suggests that the length of the RNA:DNA hybrid remains fixed at ∼3 bp and/or that local conformational changes in the RNAP and/or “scrunching” of the template allow extension of the transcript up to 8-9 nt without major refolding of the RNAP and that major changes in the organization of the complex occur during or after promoter release (9Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Science. 2002; 298: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 17Theis K. Gong P. Martin C.T.

Using limited proteolysis, it has recently been proposed that refolding of subdomain H into its final EC conformation occurs during or after promoter release (19Bandwar R.P. Tang G.Q. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 466-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To examine the transition pathway, we introduced a helix-destabilizing residue (proline) into regions of the N-terminal domain that become more α-helical during the reorganization or changed the charge of a key residue that interacts with the RNA:DNA hybrid in the EC, but not in the IC, and determined the effects of these substitutions on the early stages of transcription. A number of substitutions resulted in enhanced accumulation of products at 5-7 nt and/or a slow transition through this point (as determined by presteady state kinetic assays). The results support the idea that the transition to an EC is a sequential process in which movement of the core subdomain and refolding of certain elements in the N-terminal domain are likely to occur prior to promoter release. T7 RNAP Mutants and DNA Templates—RNAP mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and purified as described previously (20He B. Rong M. Lyakhov D. Gartenstein H. Diaz G. Castagna R. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 9: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To assemble transcription templates, template (T) and non-template (NT) strand oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA; see below) were mixed at a concentration of 100 μm each in transcription buffer (20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), heated to 65 °C for 10 min, and cooled slowly to room temperature over 2 h.

Steady State Transcription Assays—Transcription was carried out in a volume of 10 μl containing transcription buffer; 0.4 mm ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP (GE Healthcare Ultrapure); 4 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP (specific activity 6000 Ci of mmol-1; PerkinElmer Life Sciences); 50 nm RNAP; and 250 nm transcription template. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and terminated by the addition of 10 μl of stop buffer (90% formamide, 50 mm EDTA, 0.20% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.02% (w/v) xylene cyanol) followed by heating to 98 °C for 2 min. The products were resolved by electrophoresis in 20% (w/v) poly-acrylamide gels containing 7 m urea and analyzed by exposure to a PhosphorImager screen (GE Healthcare) using a Storm 860 scanner and ImageQuaNT Version 4.2a software (GE Healthcare). To compare the stability of complexes halted at various positions downstream of the promoter, transcription assays were carried out with T7 RNAP (50 nm) on the SE51/SE52 DNA template (250 nm) with restricted mixtures of substrate and/or 3′-dNTPs, as indicated, in the presence of 2 μCi γ-P32 GTP. The reactions were quenched with EDTA (100 mm) after 3 min of incubation at 37 °C (control reactions with wild type (WT) RNAP indicated that such reactions were linear for at least 10 min), and the products were analyzed by 25% PAGE. Presteady State Kinetics—Presteady state assays were carried out at 25 °C using a rapid chemical quench-flow instrument (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) (21Jia Y. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4223-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). T7 RNAP (15 μm final) and promoter DNA (10 μm final) (made from RB1 and RB2 oligomers) were mixed with NTPs (0.5 mm each final) and [γ-32P]GTP (from Amersham Biosciences), and the reaction was quenched with EDTA (150 mm) after the reaction times indicated. The quenched reaction mixtures were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min in sequencing gel loading buffer containing 50% formamide, and the products were separated in a sequencing gel containing 23% polyacrylamide, 3% bisacrylamide, and 4 m urea. The gel was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (GE Healthcare), and the products were quantified using the Image-QuaNT™ program. Trypsin Digestion—Limited proteolysis of T7 RNAP was performed as described previously (19Bandwar R.P. Tang G.Q. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 466-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, T7 RNAP (3 μm) in the absence of template or in a complex with a promoter (made from oligomers RB3/RB4) (5 μm) was incubated with trypsin (2.5 μm) at 25 °C for 20 s with or without GTP (1 mm), ATP (0.5 mm), and CTP (0.5 mm). T7 RNAP EC were assembled on a nucleic-acid scaffold (5 μm) (oligomers RB5, RB6, and RB7) for 30 min before reaction with trypsin. Design and Construction of Mutant RNAPs—The contacts made by T7 RNAP with the upstream region of the promoter in the IC largely involve three structural elements (22Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Two of these are located in the core subdomain: the A+T rich recognition loop (residues 93-101) and a β-hairpin intercalating loop (residues 230-245). The third element (the specificity loop (residues 739-769)) projects into the DNA binding cleft from the C-terminal domain. Modeling of the RNA:DNA hybrid in the early IC indicated that as the hybrid is extended from 3 to 4 bp, it would clash with elements of the core subdomain, but suggested that limited movement of the core subdomain, together with movement of the specificity loop and the upstream element of the promoter, might allow the hybrid to extend to 5 bp without substantial refolding of other elements in the N-terminal domain (10Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This scenario is supported by the observation that an IC-specific disulfide bond between the core domain and the C-terminal domain blocks transcription beyond 5-6 nt, presumably due to constrained mobility of the core (23Ma K. Temiakov D. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17612-17617Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The structure of the IC suggested that further movement of the core subdomain after this point would require refolding of elements in the N-terminal domain (in one or more stages) until the complex transitions completely to an EC. We therefore anticipated that perturbing the refolding events along the pathway might affect the pattern of abortive transcripts in a specific manner, resulting in an altered abundance of particular RNA products whose extension requires a critical refolding event at that stage. In this study, we focused upon two segments of the N-terminal domain: the N-subdomain (residues 2-71) and the C-linker. During the transition to an EC, two segments in the N-subdomain (residues 45-49 and residues 54-55) undergo reorganization to allow the formation of a long, straight α-helix (helix C (9Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Science. 2002; 298: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 10Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1). Although the N-subdomain does not interact with nucleic acids in the IC, in the EC, the C-terminal portion of the extended helix (residues 50-60) interacts with phosphate groups 5-8 bp upstream from the 3′ end of the RNA:DNA hybrid (10Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Proper refolding of the N-subdomain might therefore contribute to complex stability when the transcript achieves a length of 5-8 nt (10Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the extended α-helix protrudes into the region formerly occupied by the core subdomain in the IC and includes residues that are contiguous with the core. It therefore seemed likely that refolding of the N-subdomain and reorientation of the core are linked and that the refolded N-subdomain might help to stabilize the core in its final position. The C-linker (residues 258-266), which connects the C-terminal portion of the core subdomain to the rest of T7 RNAP, also undergoes a refolding process in which a motif that is unfolded in the IC assumes an α-helical configuration that extends the C-terminal α-helix of the core subdomain toward the largely unrearranged C-terminal domain (Fig. 1, B and C). To explore the effects of refolding of these elements, we substituted amino acids in these regions of the RNAP with proline, which is expected to disfavor the formation of an extended α-helix, and examined the consequences of these substitutions on the early stages of transcription. In addition, we also substituted a highly conserved positive residue in the N-subdomain that interacts with the phosphate group in the template DNA strand between -5 and -6 in the EC, but not in the IC, with a negatively charged residue (R50E; Table 1 and Fig. 1).TABLE 1List of T7 RNAP mutantsSubdomainMutantSubstitutionsN-subdomainNMA11E45P, M46PNMA12M54P, F55PNMA15E45P, M46P, G47PNMA17E48P, A49PSE4R50EC-linkerNMA18G259P, A260P, G263PNMA19G259P, A260P, G263ACoreBH140E148A Open table in a new tab All substitution mutants in the N-subdomain were active, but as noted below, exhibited defects in the early stages of transcription. All C-linker mutants that we constructed were inactive in a promoter-dependent transcription assay (but retained activity in a promoter-independent assay, i.e. the ability to extend an RNA primer annealed to a DNA template strand (24Temiakov D. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47035-47043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)), indicating a critical role for the integrity of this subdomain during initiation. Mutations in the N-subdomain Result in Enhanced Accumulation of Products of 5-7 nt—We examined transcription by WT and mutant RNAPs on a consensus promoter template (MJ6/MJ7) that encodes a 20-nt runoff transcript (Fig. 2A). A core subdomain mutant (E148A), which had previously been shown to make increased amounts of abortive products 5-6 nt in length (25He B. Rong M. Durbin R.K. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), was included in the assays for comparison. T7 RNAP synthesizes only a G-ladder in the presence of the initiating nucleotide, GTP, due to transcript slippage (Fig. 2A, lane 2) (4Martin C.T. Muller D.K. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3966-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). When the +4 NTP, i.e. ATP, is also present, WT RNAP synthesizes predominately a 6-nt transcript, GGGAGA (lane 1). In the presence of all four NTPs, WT RNAP makes a 20-nt runoff transcript, as well as abortive products ranging in lengths from 2 to 12 nt (4Martin C.T. Muller D.K. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3966-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, lane 3). As compared with WT RNAP, the N-subdomain proline substitution mutants all made greater amounts of abortive products of 6-7 nt (Fig. 2A, lanes 5-8, and 2B). Notably, the E148A and R50E mutants accumulated RNAs of 5-6 nt to a greater abundance during the reaction, indicating that these mutations affected initiation at an earlier stage than the proline substitution mutants (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 9, and 2B). Thus, the various mutant RNAPs tested here appear to have difficulty in elongating the RNA at different stages during the early stages of initiation. Presteady State Assays Reveal a Delay in the Transition at 6-7 nt for the N-subdomain Mutant RNAPs—The transcription assays shown in Fig. 2 were carried out over a 10-min period, during which repeated transcript release and reinitiation events occur. Although these assays reveal points at which the transcription complex may become unstable (resulting in increased accumulation of products of a particular size) or points at which transcription may be blocked (resulting in decreased synthesis of products greater than this size), they do not reveal subtle changes in the kinetics of transcription that may occur during the early stages of initiation. To accomplish this, we used a presteady state assay to examine transcription in the millisecond-second time range. Fig. 3 shows the kinetics of RNA synthesis using WT, NMA11, NMA12, NMA15, and NMA17 mutant RNAPs. All mutants showed a significant delay in the synthesis of full-length runoff product and a lag in transition through 6-7 nt. The 5-nt RNA was made within 0.25 s and extended efficiently by both WT and the N-subdomain mutants, but the 6- and 7-nt RNA products were extended poorly to 8 nt and longer by the N-subdomain mutants as compared with the WT enzyme. The 8-nt product, for instance, was made in2sbythe mutant enzymes as compared with 0.5 s by the WT enzyme. In addition, the 6-7-nt RNAs accumulated to a greater extent in the mutant enzyme reactions as compared with the WT enzyme (Fig. 3B). The mutants differ from one another in the relative production of 6- and 7-nt products. Although NMA12 and NMA17 abort transcription at 6-7 nt nearly 50% of the time, NMA11 and NMA15 accumulate these products to a level of ∼25% at t > 10 s, and the rest are elongated to longer products. Thus, the NMA11 and NMA15 mutants exhibit a weaker defect relative to the NMA12 and NMA17 mutants. As Compared with WT RNAP, N-subdomain Mutant RNAPs Exhibit Decreased Stability When Halted at 6-7 nt—The steady state transcription assays described above revealed a common defect in N-subdomain mutants (i.e. inefficient extension of transcripts beyond 6-7 nt). In addition to the slow passage through this stage (as revealed by presteady state experiments), another reason for the inefficient synthesis of transcripts beyond 6-7 nt could include a decreased stability of complexes at this stage. To examine this, we compared the turnover rates of initiation complexes halted various distances downstream from the start site for both WT and mutant enzymes. The template shown in Fig. 4 (SE51/SE52) allows the synthesis of 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-, or 7-nt products in the presence of restricted mixtures of substrate NTPs and/or the addition of chain terminating 3′-dNTPs. The rates of accumulation of these products was determined for each enzyme and normalized to the rate of production of the 2-nt product (which should be independent of the transition to an IC and serves as an internal control). The normalized rates were then compared with that of the WT enzyme to give the turnover rate for mutant complexes halted at each position relative to that of the WT enzyme. The results (Fig. 4) show that NMA12 and NMA17 form less stable complexes than the WT enzyme when halted at 7 nt, having turnover rates that are 1.8-2.6-fold higher than WT RNAP. NMA17 also exhibited a significantly higher turnover rate when halted at 6 nt. N-subdomain Mutants Are Defective in EC Formation—The conformational changes that occur during the transition to an EC are accompanied by changes in accessibility of particular regions of T7 RNAP to protease cleavage (24Temiakov D. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47035-47043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Muller D.K. Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5763-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Sousa R. Patra D. Lafer E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 319-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although limited trypsin digestion of free enzyme, a binary promoter complex, or the IC results in the appearance of a major band at 80 kDa (due to proteolysis near amino acid residues 170-180), the digestion of T7 RNAP in the EC conformation results in the appearance of a 90-kDa band due to proteolysis near residue 96 in the AT-rich recognition loop (24Temiakov D. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47035-47043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These changes in the pattern of proteolysis have been used previously to characterize the transition from IC to EC (19Bandwar R.P. Tang G.Q. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 466-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of the N-subdomain mutations on refolding of the enzyme and the transition to an EC, complexes of WT and N-subdomain mutants were formed on a promoter template in the absence of substrate (to allow the formation of a binary complex), on a promoter template in the presence of a limiting mixture of NTPs that allows the formation of an EC halted at 15 nt, or on a nucleic acid scaffold that allows the direct formation of an EC, and the pattern of trypsin cleavage of these complexes was determined (Fig. 5). In the presence of promoter only, all RNAPs (lanes 4, 8, and 12) showed patterns characteristic of the unrearranged RNAP. In the presence of promoter and limiting NTPs or on the EC scaffold, WT RNAP exhibited the cleavage pattern that is characteristic of an EC (lanes 5 and 6), whereas the mutant RNAPs showed little or no change (lanes 9, 10, 13, and 14) (NMA11 showed marginal protection of the 80-kDa fragment in the presence of scaffold only but no appearance of the 90-kDa band (lane 10)). These results suggest that a defect in the N-subdomain refolding process hinders the mutant T7 RNAPs from assuming or maintaining the EC conformation. In this work, we examined the effects of substituting a helix-destabilizing residue (proline) into regions of T7 RNAP that become more α-helical during the transition from an IC to an EC. Such mutations in the N-subdomain (residues 45-49 and 54-55) resulted in enhanced accumulation of products of 6-7 nt, indicating an instability in the transcription complexes at this point. Using a presteady state kinetic assay, we found that the mutant enzymes exhibit a slow transition through the 6-7-nt stage. Taken together, we conclude that introducing proline residues into critical regions in the N-subdomain affects RNA synthesis at a stage when the RNA:DNA hybrid reaches a length of 6-7 bp (Fig. 6). The C-linker mutants that we constructed (for NMA18, G259P, A260P, and G263P; for NMA19, G259P, A260P, and G263A) were inactive in a promoter-dependent transcription assay. Recently, Guillerez et al. (28Guillerez J. Lopez P. Proux F. Launay H. Dreyfus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5958-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) reported the selection of a mutation in the C-linker (P266L) that decreased the synthesis of abortive products of 5-6 nt. This alteration, in which a helix-destabilizing proline in the WT enzyme is replaced by a non-helix destabilizing residue, represents a mirror image of our approach. The observation that the P266L mutation enhances efficient transition through the 5-6-nt stage is in accord with our results with the N-subdomain proline mutants (which inhibit the transition), as the P226L mutation is expected to decrease the barrier to refolding, whereas our mutations are expected to increase the barrier. The finding that the P266L mutation exerts its effect earlier than the effects of the N-subdomain mutants reported here (5-6 nt versus 6-7 nt) suggests that refolding of the C-linker may be more closely linked to movement of the core subdomain. This might be expected, as refolding of the C-linker extends the C-terminal α-helix of the core toward the unchanged C-terminal domain of T7 RNAP. Proper folding of the C-linker appears to be particularly sensitive to amino acid substitutions, as attempts to isolate additional mutations in this region by saturation mutagenesis were unsuccessful (28Guillerez J. Lopez P. Proux F. Launay H. Dreyfus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5958-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This may explain why the mutations that we engineered into this region all resulted in enzymes that were inactive in a promoter-dependent assay. Our findings that mutations in the N-subdomain affect transcription when the product length reaches 6-7 nt suggest that a key step in the refolding process occurs before promoter release. The emerging consensus concerning initiation by T7 RNAP indicates that the initial collapse of the upstream region of the transcription bubble and displacement of the RNA transcript commence at about 8-9 nt and are coupled with the early stages of promoter release (13Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2725-2731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Gong P. Esposito E.A. II I Martin C.T. J. Biol.

However, promoter clearance and the formation of the final EC structure continue until ∼12 nt of RNA have been synthesized (19Bandwar R.P. Tang G.Q. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 466-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), at which point the nascent transcript is expected to have emerged through the exit pore of the RNAP to the surface (31Ma K. Temiakov D. Jiang M. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43206-43215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Consistent with this interpretation, mutations in the RNA exit pore result in complex instability and enhanced accumulation of products of 12-13 nt (29Jiang M. Ma N. Vassylyev D.G. McAllister W.T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 777-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Refolding of the N-subdomain and the formation of an extended helix allow interactions with the RNA:DNA hybrid that did not exist in the IC. One of these interactions involves a highly conserved Arg residue that forms a hydrogen bond with the phosphate backbone of the template DNA strand between positions -5 and -6 (10Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). If refolding of the N-subdomain occurs concurrently with extension of the RNA:DNA hybrid, as proposed here, these interactions would likely contribute to the stability of an intermediate complex in the transition to an EC at this point. It is therefore significant that substitution of this residue with a negatively charged amino acid (the R50E mutation) resulted in enhanced accumulation of transcripts of 5-6 nt (Fig. 2B). We note that a substitution of a residue in the “thumb” domain (R394A) that interacts with the RNA:DNA hybrid in the EC, but not in the IC, also resulted in enhanced accumulation of transcripts of 5-6 nt (32Brieba L.G. Gopal V. Sousa R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10306-10313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Earlier models suggested that T7 RNAP would be gradually reorganized to accommodate the RNA:DNA hybrid as it is extended from 3 to 8 bp (9Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Science. 2002; 298: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 10Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Another early model suggested that the RNA:DNA hybrid remains fixed at 3 bp until the transcript reaches a length of 8 nt, at which point promoter release and reorganization of the complex are expected to occur (9Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Science. 2002; 298: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). A more recent modeling study by Theis et al. (17Theis K. Gong P. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12709-12715Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Turingan R.S. Theis K. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6165-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) suggested that movement of the entire N-terminal domain (including the core subdomain) might allow extension of the hybrid to at least 6 bp, without substantial reorganization, until promoter release allows reorientation of the core and major refolding of other elements in the N-terminal domain. Although similar in some regards to the model of Tahirov et al. 10 (in that extension of the RNA:DNA hybrid results in incremental movement of the core), certain aspects of the model by Theis et al. (17Theis K. Gong P. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12709-12715Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Turingan R.S. Theis K. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6165-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) do not appear to be consistent with the observations reported here, as their model suggests that refolding of the N subdomain should occur after promoter release (at 8-9 nt). Lastly, work by Guo et al. (18Guo Q. Nayak D. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 256-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), involving both disulfide cross-linking methods as well as a tethered chemical nuclease to probe the organization of the complex, suggested that no major reorganization of the complex occurred until promoter release and that the growing transcript was accommodated by local conformational changes and/or scrunching of the DNA template and/or the nascent transcript. However, the model of Guo et al. (18Guo Q. Nayak D. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 256-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) is silent about whether the RNA:DNA hybrid is extended from 3 to 8 bp during the initiation process or how such an extended hybrid might be accommodated. It is important to note that our results reflect only changes that involve the N-terminal subdomain and do not address issues as to when promoter contacts might be lost or when refolding of other elements in the N-terminal domain may occur. Clearly, more studies will be needed to address these topics, including the solution of crystal structures that capture intermediates during the transition to an EC. We are grateful to Mr. Ray Castagna for expert technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1984071520,"C-terminal-binding protein interacting protein (CtIP) was first isolated as a binding partner of C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP). It is considered to contribute to the transcriptional repression and cell cycle regulatory properties of the retinoblastoma (Rb) family of proteins and to have a role in the cellular response to DNA damage. Here, we have shown that CtIP is a novel target for the adenovirus oncoprotein early region 1A (AdE1A). AdE1A associates with CtIP in both Ad5E1-transformed cells and Ad5-infected cells and binds directly in glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays. Two binding sites have been mapped on Ad5E1A - the N-terminal alpha-helical region (residues 1-30) and conserved region 3 (CR3) - the transcriptional activation domain. CtIP can bind AdE1A and CtBP independently, raising the possibility that ternary complexes exist in Ad-transformed and -infected cells. Significantly, reduction of CtIP expression with small interfering RNAs results in reduction of the ability of a Gal4 DNA-binding domain-CR3 construct to transactivate a Gal 4-responsive luciferase reporter and this effect is reversed by reduction of CtBP expression. Therefore, in this model, CtIP acts as a transcriptional co-activator of AdE1A when dissociated from CtBP, through the action of AdE1A. These data are consistent with observations that CtIP expression is induced by AdE1A during viral infection and that reduction of CtIP expression with RNA interference can retard virus replication. In addition, AdE1A causes disruption of the CtIP/Rb complex during viral infection by its interaction with CtIP, possibly contributing to transcriptional derepression."

Although the underlying mechanism has not been unraveled, an emerging body of evidence supports that H4 tail and its post-translational modification function as a recruitment motif for key factors required for proper regulation of chromatin transcription. To investigate these aspects, we have generated HeLa cell lines that constitutively express ectopic H4 tail domain for biochemical purification of proteins associated with H4 tail. We found that expressed H4 tails stably associate with sets of transcription regulatory factors and histone methyltransferases distinct from those that associate with histone H3 tails. Importantly, point mutations of four major lysine substrates to block cellular acetylation of ectopic H4 tail significantly inhibited the association of histone methyltransferases and sets of transcription-activating factors, supporting a major role of acetylation on recruitmentbased action of H4 tail during transcription. Further, our transcription analysis revealed that the proteins associated with wild-type/acetylated H4 tail, but not with mutant/unacetylated H4 tail, can enhance p300-dependent chromatin transcription.

The DNA in eukaryotic cells is hierarchically packaged by four core histones to form a highly dynamic structure of chromatin (1Van Holde K.E.

Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The histone N termini (called histone “tails”) that protrude from the surface of the nucleosome are key elements in the regulation of the functional state of chromatin. The most important character of histone tails is their reversible post-translational modifications, which are linked to both activation and repression of chromatin transcription (5Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 6Cosgrove M.S. Wolberger C. Biochem.

Histone acetylation is one of the major modifications that are introduced on specific lysine residues of all four core histones and generally associated with transcriptional activation (8Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar, 9Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). In particular, given that the H3–H4 tetramers interact with the central part of nucleosomal DNA, H3–H4 tail domains and their acetylations have been linked to the major arbiters for transcriptional activation (10Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6789) Google Scholar). Indeed recent studies using recombinant chromatin templates clearly established a critical role of acetylations of H3–H4 tails in p300-mediated transcription based on the transcription-inhibiting effects of substitution of major lysine substrates or deletion of H3–H4 tails (11An W. Palhan V.B. Karymov M.A. Leuba S.H. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 811-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Histone methylation is another modification that occurs particularly in lysine and arginine residues of histones H3 and H4 with remarkable specificity (12Shilatifard A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 13Zhang Y. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2343-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). Although it remains unclear to what extent, histone H3 and H4 methylation has been recognized as a key player for the precise regulation of chromatin function. In sharp contrast with histone acetylation, histone methylation can result in either activation or repression of chromatin transcription, depending on the modification site within histones (14Santos-Rosa H.

In many cases, H3–H4 tails exposed outside of the nucleosome core are found to serve as binding sites for distinct sets of factors that facilitate chromatin remodeling, and this altered chromatin state in turn regulates the transcriptional machinery to initiate gene transcription. The addition of chemical moieties on H3–H4 tails has been proposed to have specific effects on this recruitment-based action of H3 and H4 tails in transcription (18Strahl B.D. Allis C.D.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 20: 124-128Crossref Scopus (546) Google Scholar).As part of an effort to understand the mechanism of action of histone tails and their modifications in transcription, we recently have developed the protocol to purify histone tail-interacting proteins from living cells by constitutively expressing histone tail domains (28Heo K. Kim B. Kim K. Choi J. Kim H. Zhan Y. Ranish J.A. An W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15476-15483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Following this new protocol, we successfully purified and identified sets of histone modifying and transcription regulatory factors stably associated with ectopic H3 tails. Additionally, our transcription assays showed that the H3 tail-associated factors significantly enhance p53-dependent, p300-mediated transcription from chromatin template. More importantly, it appears that cellular methylations of H3 tails at Lys-9 and Lys-27 are required for the association of repressive factors such as HP1, HDAC5/9, Mi-2b, G9a, and TIF1β. Thus our observations bear an important implication on a possible coupling between H3 tail-mediated factor recruitment and chromatin transcription. Given this selective interaction of H3 tails with regulatory proteins, it would be interesting to check if other histone tails also recognize specific signaling components to give similar outcomes in chromatin transcription.In the present study, we extended our efforts to characterize H4 tail-interacting factors purified from cells that continuously express the epitope-tagged H4 tail domain. This approach allowed us to purify and identify multiple regulatory factors that specifically associate with H4 tails in vivo. Significantly, in support of chromatin-specific action of these H4 tail-associated factors, purified factors can activate p53-dependent, p300-mediated transcription from chromatin templates, but not from DNA template. More importantly, similar experiments with proteins purified with lysine-mutated (unacetylated) H4 tails showed no stimulatory effect on transcription, clearly high-lighting the requirement of acetylation of ectopic H4 tails for the association of active factors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Plasmids—The cDNA corresponding to the first 40 amino acids of human H4 was generated by PCR amplification using the sense primer 5′-GGCTAGATATCACTAGCAACCTCAAACAG and the antisense primer 5′-GTCGTCCTTGTAATCGCCGTCCTCATCTTGACGAGAG. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with NotI and EcoRI and subcloned into the same sites of pBS SK+ (pBS-1xnH4). The plasmid (pBS-2xnH4) containing two copies of H4 tail cDNA was generated by inserting the NsiI-EcoRI-digested H4 tail cDNA fragment into PstI-EcoRI-digested pBS-1xnH4. The NsiI-EcoRI fragment containing two copies of H4 tail from pBS-2xnH4 was inserted into PstI-EcoRI-digested pBS-2xnH4 to generate the plasmid containing four copies of H4 tail (pBS-4xnH4). The plasmid for mammalian expression was generated by inserting the EcoRI-NotI digested four copies of H4 tail fragments from pBS-4xnH4 into the same sites of pIRES, which has been modified to carry the FLAG-HA epitope at the 5′-end of the inserts (pFHnH4-IRESneo). For the plasmid encoding the mutant H4 tail domain, the same procedure was followed except that Lys-5, Lys-8, Lys-12, and Lys-16 of the original H4 cDNA were first mutated to arginine by the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Purification and Mass Spectrometry Analysis of the H4 Tail-associated Factors—To generate the stable cell lines that express human H4 tail domains, HeLa cells were transfected with pFHnH4-IRESneo using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and selected with G418 (500 μg/ml) for 2 weeks. Selected cells were grown in suspension culture (20 liters) at 37 °C to the density of 1.3 × 106/ml, and nuclear extracts were prepared from cells as described (29Malik S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 364: 257-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For the purification of H4 tail-associated factors, 200 mg of nuclear extract was applied to a P11 ion exchange column (Whatman). The P11 BC1000 fractions containing expressed H4 tails were dialyzed against BC300 and applied to anti-FLAG M2 affinity chromatography (Sigma). The H4 tail-associated factors were eluted from the affinity resins by using FLAG peptide (200 ng/ml) after washing with BC300 containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The purified proteins were analyzed by data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry as described recently (30Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (4320) Google Scholar). Peptides were identified by searching tandem mass spectrometry spectra against a human protein sequence data base using SEQUEST as described previously (31Yates J.R. II I Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using a suite of software tools, including INTERACT (32Han D.K. Eng J. Zhou H.

Chem. 2003; 75: 4646-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (3562) Google Scholar), to determine whether peptide and protein assignments were correct.Preparation of Histone Octamers—Expression of intact and tailless histones and preparation of histone octamers were essentially as described (11An W.

Rice.Histone Methyltransferase and in Vitro Transcription Assays—HMT assays were performed with 1 μg of recombinant histone octamers as recently described (28Heo K. Kim B. Kim K. Choi J. Kim H.

Standard p53-dependent transcription assays were performed as reported recently (28Heo K. Kim B. Kim K. Choi J. Kim H. Zhan Y. Ranish J.A. An W. J. Biol.

Because other histone tails are also known to interact with chromatin-associated proteins in vitro, the use of a similar method to identify and characterize factors recognizing other histone tails should be a logical extension of our study. To this end, we created HeLa cell lines with FLAG and HA tags integrated at the N terminus of the gene encoding the first 40 amino acids of human histone H4. The tail domain contains the nuclear localization signal, which will allow sub-cellular traffic of the H4 tail from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (37Mosammaparast N. Guo Y. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 862-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We first checked whether the expressed tails are accumulated in the HeLa nucleus. As expected, major fractions of expressed tails were transported from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (Fig. 1B).Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured cells grown in suspension culture and fractionated on P11 chromatography using a step gradient with increasing salt. Western blot analysis of eluates from the column with FLAG antibody showed that the H4 tail-associated factors were present in P11 BC1000 fraction (Fig. 1A). To purify the proteins further, the H4 tail-containing P11 fraction was applied to immunoaffinity chromatography on anti-FLAG resin, and the H4 tails were eluted by FLAG peptide in complexes with their interacting factors. In parallel, we also generated a cell line with mutant H4 tail domain carrying arginine substitutions at four major acetylation sites (Lys-5, Lys-8, Lys-12, and Lys-16), which block cellular acetylation of the H4 tail domain. We found that the level of expression and nuclear localization of the mutant H4 tail is comparable with that of the wild-type H4 tail (Fig. 1B). Nuclear extracts from cultured cells were subjected to the same purification procedure employed to isolate wild-type H4 tail-associated factors. Our purification of wild-type and mutant tail-associated factors was confirmed by Western blot analysis with HA antibody (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3). SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified factors revealed similar band profiles between wild-type and mutant H4 tail-associated factors, along with four additional high molecular bands in the wild-type tail-associated factors and one additional low molecular band in the mutant tail-associated factors (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Identification of H4 tail-associated polypeptides. A, mass spectrometric analysis of H4 tail-associated polypeptides. After a large scale isolation of H4 tail-associated polypeptides, the purified polypeptides were resolved in 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE. The specific polypeptide bands were excised, and the protein identities were determined by mass spectrometric analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures”. Proteins associated with only wild-type H4 tails are underlined.

Because several protein bands were specifically stained in wild-type or mutant H4 tail-associated factors, we paid special attention to these proteins. From our analysis of the wild-type H4 tail-associated factors, we identified 18 proteins that have previously been shown to play a role in transcription regulation. Two of these proteins are HMTs PRMT5 and DOT1L (Fig. 2A, lane 1). PRMT5 is known to methylate arginine 3 on H4 and to a lesser extent unknown sites on H3/H2A tails (38Branscombe T.L. Frankel A. Lee J.H. Cook J.R. Yang Z. Pestka S. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32971-32976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), whereas DOT1L mediates H3 methylation with substrate specificity for Lys-79 (39Feng Q. Wang H. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Struhl K. Zhang Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1052-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 40van Leeuwen F. Gafken P.R. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Because H4 tail is localized in the vicinity of H3-Lys-79 (10Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6789) Google Scholar), it is not unlikely that H4 tails play a role in controlling H3-Lys-79 methylation, possibly through stable recruitment of DOT1L onto nucleosomes. We also identified two chromatin remodeling-related factors BAF53 and nucleolin in the H4 tail-associated factors (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Because these two factors have been shown to assist nucleosome remodeling (41Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 42Angelov D. Bondarenko V.A. Almagro S. Menoni H. Mongelard F. Hans F. Mietton F. Studitsky V.M. Hamiche A. Dimitrov S. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 2006; 19: 1669-1679Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar), our results also raise the possibility that H4 tails play a role in initial association of these activities to facilitate transcription through the nucleosome. In addition, a group of proteins related to transcriptional regulation (MTA2, BAF170, β-actin, TRAP150, TAF4, CRSP3, CAPERα, Ddx17, COBRA1, and hnRNP K) were identified in the H4 tail-associated factors (Fig. 2A, lane 1).On the other hand, mutations of tail acetylation sites (Lys-5, Lys-8, Lys-12, and Lys-16) completely abolished association of H4 tails with ten active factors BAF170, DOT1L, TRAP150, TAF4, CRSP3, Nucleolin, MTA2, COBRA1, hnRNP K, and BAF53, which allows us to categorize them as acetylation-specific binding proteins (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Further analysis detected p66α, SRp30c, and p32 in the mutant H4 tail-associated factors (Fig. 2A, lane 2) but not in the wild-type tail-associated factors, implying that cellular acetylation of ectopic H4 tails has inhibitory effects on association of these repressive factors. The mass spectrometry results were further confirmed by immunoblot using available antibodies. Interestingly, although we could detect PRMT5 in both wild-type and mutant H4 tail-associated factors by mass spectrometry analysis, our Western blot analysis revealed that association of PRMT5 with H4 tail was distinctly reduced by the mutations (Fig. 2B). Control purifications performed with normal HeLa nuclear extract did not show any bands in all Western blot analysis, demonstrating that all purified proteins specifically interact with the tagged H4 tails (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Collectively, our results indicate that free H4 tail domains ectopically expressed in living cells can interact with sets of chromatin remodeling and transcription factors.Cellular Acetylation and Methylation of Expressed H4 Tails—Because ectopic H4 tails can undergo dynamic post-translational modification via the actions of cellular modifying enzymes, we next assessed the modification status of the ectopic H4 tails by Western blot analysis. Specificity of the antibodies used in this study was confirmed by Western blot analysis using (un) modified recombinant H4 (data not shown). We first checked the acetylation of purified H4 tails by using a set of highly specific antibodies that recognize acetylation of individual lysine residues within H4 tails (Lys-5, Lys-8, Lys-12, and Lys-16). Consistent with the previous reports that cellular acetylation at Lys-8 is only introduced onto nucleosomal H4 (43Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 44Karachentsev D. Druzhinina M. Steward R. Dev. Biol. 2007; 304: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), our purified H4 tails were found to be acetylated at Lys-5, Lys-12, and Lys-16, but not Lys-8 (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Therefore cellular acetylation of free H4 tails appears to be selective process rather than random process.FIGURE 3Cellular modifications of ectopically expressed H4 tails. A, acetylation status of the ectopically expressed H4 tails. Wild-type and mutant H4 tail-associated factors were subjected to immunoblot analysis with acetylation specific antibodies as indicated.

We detected symmetric di-methylation of Arg-3 (Fig. 3B, lane 2), which are generally related to gene activation (45Dacwag C.S. Ohkawa Y. Pal S. Sif S. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 46Richard S. Morel M. Cleroux P. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has been shown that PRMT5 catalyzes symmetric dimethylation of H4-Arg-3, whereas another H4-Arg-3-specific methyltransferase PRMT1 results in the generation of asymmetric di-methylation (17Wang H. Huang Z.Q. Xia L. Feng Q. Erdjument-Bromage H. Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Wong J. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Science. 2001; 293: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 38Branscombe T.L.

Therefore we assume that PRMT5 of the tail-associated factors generates methylation of Arg-3 of ectopic H4 tails. Similar analysis with mono-, di-, and tri-methylation of Lys-20 also revealed mono-methylation of Lys-20 (Fig. 3C, lane 2), which is related to both transcription activation and repression (47Talasz H.
