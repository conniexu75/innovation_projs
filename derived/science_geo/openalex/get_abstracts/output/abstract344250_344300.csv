https://openalex.org/W1973402039,Boreholes drilled to the bottom of ice stream B in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet reveal that the base of the ice stream is at the melting point and the basal water pressure is within about 1.6 bars of the ice overburden pressure. These conditions allow the rapid ice streaming motion to occur by basal sliding or by shear deformation of unconsolidated sediments that underlie the ice in a layer at least 2 meters thick. The mechanics of ice streaming plays a role in the response of the ice sheet to climatic change.
https://openalex.org/W1970382894,"An undescribed mussel (family Mytilidae), which lives in the vicinity of hydrocarbon seeps in the Gulf of Mexico, consumes methane (the principal component of natural gas) at a high rate. The methane consumption is limited to the gills of these animals and is apparently due to the abundant intracellular bacteria found there. This demonstrates a methane-based symbiosis between an animal and intracellular bacteria. Methane consumption is dependent on the availability of oxygen and is inhibited by acetylene. The consumption of methane by these mussels is associated with a dramatic increase in oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. As the methane consumption of the bivalve can exceed its carbon dioxide production, the symbiosis may be able to entirely satisfy its carbon needs from methane uptake. The very light (delta(13)C = -51 to -57 per mil) stable carbon isotope ratios found in this animal support methane (delta(13)C = -45 per mil at this site) as the primary carbon source for both the mussels and their symbionts."
https://openalex.org/W2090062686,"Eggshells of the African ostrich (Struthio camelus), ubiquitous in archeological sites in Africa, have been shown by laboratory simulation experiments to retain their indigenous organic matrix residues during diagenesis far better than any other calcified tissue yet studied. The rate of L-isoleucine epimerization to D-alloisoleucine follows reversible first-order kinetics and has been calibrated for local temperature effects and used to estimate the age range of stratified archeological sites. Age estimates are consistent with radiocarbon dates from several stratified archeological sites. With adequate calibration, this technique can provide accurate ages to within 10 to 15 percent for strata deposited within the last 200,000 years in the tropics and the last 1,000,000 years in colder regions such as China."
https://openalex.org/W2141746703,"Rapid progress has taken place in the generation and application of femtosecond optical pulses. The impact of these developments is being felt in a broad range of scientific fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. These rapidly evolving techniques have been applied to such diverse problems as phase transitions in highly excited semiconductors, molecular photofragment spectroscopy, impulsive phonon generation in solids, and optical radar ranging through biological tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1974555416,"Planktotrophic larvae that occur beneath the annual sea ice in the Antarctic assimilate organic solutes and preferentially ingest bacteria, whereas they actively exclude phytoplankton. In regions where phytoplankton biomass is temporally limited by light or nutrient concentrations, the growth and development of planktotrophic larvae may not be directly coupled to phytoplankton production."

https://openalex.org/W2062222413,"Temperatures of equilibration for the majority (81 percent) of the eclogite xenoliths of the Roberts Victor kimberlite pipe in South Africa range between 1000 degrees and 1250 degrees C, falling essentially on the gap of the lower limb of the subcontinental inflected geotherm derived from garnet peridotite xenoliths. In view of the Archean age (>2.6 x 10(9) years) of these eclogites and their stratigraphic position on the geotherm, it is proposed that the inflected part of the geotherm represents the convective boundary layer beneath the conductive lid of the lithospheric plate. The gradient of 8 Celsius degrees per kilometer for the inflection is characteristic of a double thermal boundary layer and suggests layered convection rather than whole mantle convection for the earth."
