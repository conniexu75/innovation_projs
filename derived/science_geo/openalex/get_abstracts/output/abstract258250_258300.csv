https://openalex.org/W2057249855,"Filamentous tau inclusions are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies, but earlier pathologies may herald disease onset. To investigate this, we studied wild-type and P301S mutant human tau transgenic (Tg) mice. Filamentous tau lesions developed in P301S Tg mice at 6 months of age, and progressively accumulated in association with striking neuron loss as well as hippocampal and entorhinal cortical atrophy by 9-12 months of age. Remarkably, hippocampal synapse loss and impaired synaptic function were detected in 3 month old P301S Tg mice before fibrillary tau tangles emerged. Prominent microglial activation also preceded tangle formation. Importantly, immunosuppression of young P301S Tg mice with FK506 attenuated tau pathology and increased lifespan, thereby linking neuroinflammation to early progression of tauopathies. Thus, hippocampal synaptic pathology and microgliosis may be the earliest manifestations of neurodegenerative tauopathies, and abrogation of tau-induced microglial activation could retard progression of these disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2149821716,"Carbon monoxide (CO), which is produced endogenously in the breakdown of heme, has been recognized as an important physiological second messenger similar to NO. Additionally, pharmacological delivery of CO is protective in numerous models of injury, including ischemia/reperfusion, transplantation, hemorrhagic shock, and endotoxemia. However, the mechanism of action of CO is only partially elucidated focused primarily on how it modulates the cellular response to stress. The purpose of these investigations is to test the hypothesis that CO acts via inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase leading to the generation of low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that in turn mediate subsequent adaptive signaling. We show here that CO increases ROS generation in RAW 264.7 cells, which is inhibited by antimycin A and is absent in respiration-deficient rho0 cells. CO inhibits cytochrome c oxidase, while maintaining cellular ATP levels and increasing mitochondrial membrane potential. The addition of antioxidants or inhibition of complex III of the electron transport chain by antimycin A attenuates the inhibitory effects of CO on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF-alpha and blocked CO-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation, which we previously have shown to be important in the anti-inflammatory effects of CO."

Duncan Watts, who with Steven Strogatz published the Nature paper that introduced the 'small world' phenomenon in 1998 (later familiar as 'six degrees of separation'), puts in a word for the social sciences in this week's Essay. Starting from the premise that the major problems facing humanity today are social and economic, Watts constructs an early bid for social science as the science of the twenty-first century. Work on social networks and the data collecting power of the Internet are strong foundations for a new science that could revolutionize our understanding of collective human behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2014699403,"The relationships between plant viruses, their herbivore vectors and host plants can be beneficial, neutral, or antagonistic, depending on the species involved. This variation in relationships may affect the process of biological invasion and the displacement of indigenous species by invaders when the invasive and indigenous organisms occur with niche overlap but differ in the interactions. The notorious invasive B biotype of the whitefly complex Bemisia tabaci entered China in the late 1990s and is now the predominant or only biotype in many regions of the country. Tobacco curly shoot virus (TbCSV) and Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) are two whitefly-transmitted begomoviruses that have become widespread recently in south China. We compared the performance of the invasive B and indigenous ZHJ1 whitefly biotypes on healthy, TbCSV-infected and TYLCCNV-infected tobacco plants. Compared to its performance on healthy plants, the invasive B biotype increased its fecundity and longevity by 12 and 6 fold when feeding on TbCSV-infected plants, and by 18 and 7 fold when feeding on TYLCCNV-infected plants. Population density of the B biotype on TbCSV- and TYLCCNV-infected plants reached 2 and 13 times that on healthy plants respectively in 56 days. In contrast, the indigenous ZHJ1 performed similarly on healthy and virus-infected plants. Virus-infection status of the whiteflies per se of both biotypes showed limited effects on performance of vectors on cotton, a nonhost plant of the viruses. The indirect mutualism between the B biotype whitefly and these viruses via their host plants, and the apparent lack of such mutualism for the indigenous whitefly, may contribute to the ability of the B whitefly biotype to invade, the displacement of indigenous whiteflies, and the disease pandemics of the viruses associated with this vector."
https://openalex.org/W2026266643,"Background Osteoclasts are bone-degrading cells, which play a central role in physiological bone remodeling. Unbalanced osteoclast activity is largely responsible for pathological conditions such as osteoporosis. Osteoclasts develop specialized adhesion structures, the so-called podosomes, which subsequently undergo dramatic reorganization into sealing zones. These ring-like adhesion structures, which delimit the resorption site, effectively seal the cell to the substrate forming a diffusion barrier. The structural integrity of the sealing zone is essential for the cell ability to degrade bone, yet its structural organization is poorly understood. Principal Findings Combining high-resolution scanning electron microscopy with fluorescence microscopy performed on the same sample, we mapped the molecular architecture of the osteoclast resorptive apparatus from individual podosomes to the sealing zone, at an unprecedented resolution. Podosomes are composed of an actin-bundle core, flanked by a ring containing adhesion proteins connected to the core via dome-like radial actin fibers. The sealing zone, hallmark of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, consists of a dense array of podosomes communicating through a network of actin filaments, parallel to the substrate and anchored to the adhesive plaque domain via radial actin fibers. Significance The sealing zone of osteoclasts cultured on bone is made of structural units clearly related to individual podosomes. It differs from individual or clustered podosomes in the higher density and degree of inter-connectivity of its building blocks, thus forming a unique continuous functional structure connecting the cell to its extracellular milieu. Through this continuous structure, signals reporting on the substrate condition may be transmitted to the whole cell, modulating the cell response under physiological and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2090339308,"Currently, no treatment can prevent the cognitive and motor decline associated with widespread neurodegeneration in prion disease. However, we previously showed that targeting endogenous neuronal prion protein (PrPC) (the precursor of its disease-associated isoform, PrPSc) in mice with early prion infection reversed spongiform change and prevented clinical symptoms and neuronal loss. We now show that cognitive and behavioral deficits and impaired neurophysiological function accompany early hippocampal spongiform pathology. Remarkably, these behavioral and synaptic impairments recover when neuronal PrPC is depleted, in parallel with reversal of spongiosis. Thus, early functional impairments precede neuronal loss in prion disease and can be rescued. Further, they occur before extensive PrPSc deposits accumulate and recover rapidly after PrPC depletion, supporting the concept that they are caused by a transient neurotoxic species, distinct from aggregated PrPSc. These data suggest that early intervention in human prion disease may lead to recovery of cognitive and behavioral symptoms.

These data suggest that early intervention in human prion disease may lead to recovery of cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Changes in motivation, mood, and behavior are common early symptoms in human prion disorders, especially variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), often occurring long before diagnosis is made. By the time characteristic dementia and motor deficits are established, there is typically advanced neuronal loss, with no realistic potential for curative treatment or recovery. In experimentally infected mice, clinical disease is diagnosed by the presence of locomotor changes, but again, these occur during advanced disease and correspond with irreversible neuronal loss. However, there are earlier pathological and phenotypic changes. Spongiform change and synapse loss precede neuronal loss (Jeffrey et al., 2000Jeffrey M. Halliday W.G. Bell J. Johnston A.R. Macleod N.K. Ingham C. Sayers A.R. Brown D.A. Fraser J.R. Synapse loss associated with abnormal PrP precedes neuronal degeneration in the scrapie-infected murine hippocampus.Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2000; 26: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and changes in species-typical behaviors also occur long before typical motor symptoms (Betmouni et al., 1999Betmouni S.

Boche D. Waters S. Diniz C.P. Scott H. Rawlins J.N. Perry V.H. Synaptic changes characterize early behavioural signs in the ME7 model of murine prion disease.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 2147-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We previously showed that early spongiform degeneration in the hippocampus of prion-infected mice reverses when PrPC is depleted in neurons (Mallucci et al., 2003Mallucci G. Dickinson A. Linehan J. Klohn P.C. Brandner S. Collinge J. Depleting neuronal PrP in prion infection prevents disease and reverses spongiosis.Science. 2003; 302: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). We now ask whether this early pathological change produces functional deficits and whether its reversal is reflected in functional recovery. As the hippocampus is particularly targeted by several strains of murine prions and is easily accessible for neurophysiological measurements, we focused on tests of hippocampal function. We used prion-infected transgenic mice with and without “induced” PrP depletion for our experiments. Thus, tg37 mice express PrP from “floxed” PrP sequences (MloxP transgenes) and succumb to Rocky Mountain Laboratory (RML) prion infection ∼13 weeks postinoculation (wpi) (Mallucci et al., 2002Mallucci G.R. Ratté S. Asante E.A. Linehan J. Gowland I. Jefferys J.G.R. Collinge J. Post-natal knockout of prion protein alters hippocampal CA1 properties, but does not result in neurodegeneration.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In these mice, earliest prion pathological changes, including spongiosis, gliosis, and PrPSc deposition, appear by 8 wpi (Mallucci et al., 2003Mallucci G. Dickinson A. Linehan J. Klohn P.C. Brandner S. Collinge J. Depleting neuronal PrP in prion infection prevents disease and reverses spongiosis.Science. 2003; 302: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In double-transgenic NFH-Cre/tg37 mice, PrP expression is the same as in tg37 mice until floxed PrP sequences are excised by the DNA recombinase, Cre (Sauer and Henderson, 1989Sauer B. Henderson N. Cre-stimulated recombination at loxP-containing DNA sequences placed into the mammalian genome.Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), at ∼9–10 weeks of age, when neuronal PrP is depleted (Mallucci et al., 2002Mallucci G.R. Ratté S. Asante E.A. Linehan J. Gowland I. Jefferys J.G.R. Collinge J. Post-natal knockout of prion protein alters hippocampal CA1 properties, but does not result in neurodegeneration.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). NFH-Cre/tg37 mice infected with prions at 1 week of age develop early hippocampal pathology in parallel with control tg37 mice, but spongiosis reverses soon after Cre-mediated PrP depletion ∼8–9 wpi, and the animals survive long term (Mallucci et al., 2003Mallucci G. Dickinson A. Linehan J. Klohn P.C. Brandner S. Collinge J. Depleting neuronal PrP in prion infection prevents disease and reverses spongiosis.Science. 2003; 302: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). We tested memory function and spontaneous ethological behaviors in vivo and measured synaptic responses neurophysiologically in vitro. We used the novel object recognition task, a nonspatial learning task based on the spontaneous preference of both mice and rats for novelty and their ability to remember previously encountered objects, that is rapidly learned (Clark et al., 2000Clark R.E. Zola S.M. Squire L.R. Impaired recognition memory in rats after damage to the hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8853-8860PubMed Google Scholar, Dodart et al., 1997Dodart J.C. Mathis C. Ungerer A.

Mem. 1997; 67: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In rodents, the hippocampus is thought to be involved in delay-dependent object-recognition memory (i.e., when recognition intervals are long, >24 hr after learning phase), whereas recall over shorter retention intervals is thought to involve parahippocampal structures (Clark et al., 2000Clark R.E.

Hippocampal damage and anterograde object-recognition in rats after long retention intervals.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 1050-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Novel-object recognition is extensively used for testing declarative memory in mice, and, critically, performance is independent of mouse strain or genetic background, unlike most other memory tasks for which performance is highly strain dependent (Sik et al., 2003Sik A. van Nieuwehuyzen P. Prickaerts J. Blokland A. Performance of different mouse strains in an object recognition task.Behav. Brain Res. 2003; 147: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We also tested the spontaneous behaviors of burrowing and nesting, which have a robust association with early prion pathology (Betmouni et al., 1999Betmouni S. Deacon R.M.J. Rawlins J.N.P. Ferry V.H. Behavioral consequences of prion disease targeted to the hippocampus in a mouse model of scrapie.Psychobiology. 1999; 27: 63-71Google Scholar, Cunningham et al., 2005Cunningham C. Deacon R.M. Chan K.

Early behavioural changes in scrapie-affected mice and the influence of dapsone.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also localize to the dorsal hippocampus. These behaviors have been proposed as powerful tools for elucidating brain function (Gerlai and Clayton, 1999Gerlai R. Clayton N.S. Analysing hippocampal function in transgenic mice: an ethological perspective.Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 47-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), requiring a high degree of organization and executive function, and are thought to reflect motivational aspects of spontaneous behavior in rodents. We infected tg37 and NFH-Cre/tg37 mice with RML prions at 1 week of age and tested groups of eight to ten mice of each genotype at each time point behaviorally and neurophysiologically from 7 wpi. Tg37 mice were tested up to ∼12 wpi, after which they developed clinical signs of prion disease and were culled. NFH-Cre/tg37 mice were tested up to ∼30 wpi. Groups of six mice infected in parallel were examined neuropathologically every 2 weeks postinoculation. Equal numbers of uninfected mice were tested at three representative time points (pre-, during-, and post-PrP depletion) to exclude unforeseen effects of loss of PrP expression itself. We first assessed animals in the novel object recognition task (Figure 1). We used male mice, as they are generally considered superior to females at localizing and recognizing objects (Frick and Gresack, 2003Frick K.M. Gresack J.E. Sex differences in the behavioral response to spatial and object novelty in adult C57BL/6 mice.Behav. Neurosci. 2003; 117: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). All animals received intensive training in an arena containing two objects that they could explore freely (learning phase). Forty-eight hours later, they were re-exposed to two objects, one of which was familiar and one new (test phase) according to established protocols (Bozon et al., 2003Bozon B. Davis S. Laroche S. A requirement for the immediate early gene zif268 in reconsolidation of recognition memory after retrieval.Neuron. 2003; 40: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). The same animals were tested sequentially at different time points throughout the course of infection, using different sets of objects at each time point. The percentage of time spent exploring the novel compared to the familiar object was expressed as a ratio of exploratory preference and used as a measure of memory. Random exploration of the two objects results in a ratio of 1; preferential exploration of the novel object compared to the other gives a ratio greater than 1. Statistical significance of data was calculated using parametric tests (Student's t test; two-tailed) after confirmation that data were normally distributed. All mice tested showed random exploration of the equally unfamiliar objects during the learning phase of the test, with a baseline exploratory ratio of ∼1 (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available online). At 7 wpi, all prion-infected animals displayed normal novel-object discrimination during the test phase (Figure 1B), with mean exploratory preference ratios of 1.70 ± 0.19 SEM (tg37 controls) and 1.81 ± 0.07 SEM (NFH-Cre/tg37 mice). But at 8 wpi, both groups of infected mice showed significant inability to discriminate a novel object during the test phase, with mean exploratory preference ratios of 1.05 ± 0.05 SEM and 0.90 ± 0.03 SEM, respectively, for the novel object: i.e., no preference. These differences in exploration at 7 wpi versus 8 wpi were significant for mice of both genotypes: p = 0.0001 for NFH-Cre/tg37 mice and p = 0.0498 for tg37 mice, and p = 0.0001 when mice of both groups are pooled at 7 and 8 wpi and compared. The loss in novel-object discriminatory capacity coincided with the appearance of early spongiform change in all prion-infected mice (Figure 1C, center panels) and with reduction of synaptic responses (see below and Figures 5A–5C). In prion-diseased tg37 mice, this impairment of memory persisted throughout the course of infection (Figure 1B). By 12 wpi, when they were beginning to show early signs of prion disease (such as reduced grooming, but not overt motor signs), the exploratory preference ratio was inverted at 0.64 ± 0.05 SEM (p = 0.0012 for exploration compared to 7 wpi), possibly reflecting preference for the familiar object and neophobia (anxiety induced by novel objects) at this stage in tg37 mice. In contrast to tg37 mice, NFH-Cre/tg37 mice recovered the ability to discriminate novel objects after neuronal PrPC depletion. The exploratory preference for the novel object returned at 9 wpi (mean ratio of 1.40 ± 0.05 SEM; Figure 1B), very soon after PrP depletion, (p = 0.0004 for NFH-Cre/tg37 mice at 9 wpi compared to 8 wpi). The difference between mice with and without PrP depletion at 9 wpi is also significant (p = 0.0451). This functional recovery occurred in parallel with reversal of spongiform pathology seen in NFH-Cre/tg37 mice examined histologically over this period (Figure 1C, panels E and F). Further, the recovery in memory was sustained up to 20+ wpi, with a mean exploratory ratio of 1.67 ± 0.25 SEM. Numbers available for testing after 20 weeks were diminished because group-housed males that were intermittently separated for testing fought over time and had to be singly housed, excluding them from further testing. The difference in exploratory preference ratios, or memory, for all time points after PrP depletion compared to performance at 8 wpi prior to depletion is highly significant: p < 0.00001. ANOVA analysis of all data sets for group effects also resulted in p < 0.0001. Uninfected mice examined at representative time points retained exploratory capacity (Figure S2), ruling out the possibility that PrPC depletion itself might alter object-recognition memory. The loss of preferential exploration of a novel object in tg37 mice was not due to prion-related changes in motor function. Indeed, we found that activity in the open field increased, rather than decreased, with disease progression up to 12 wpi in tg37 animals (Figure 1D) (p = 0.013 for activity of tg37 mice at 12 wpi compared to 8 wpi, and p = 0.015 compared to 10 wpi), but not in NFH-Cre/tg37 mice or in uninfected animals (Figure S3). This is consistent with previous observations in prion-infected mice of several strains (Cunningham et al., 2005Cunningham C. Deacon R.M. Chan K. Boche D. Rawlins J.N. Perry V.H.

Limb power, assessed by testing grip strength, was unaffected in all mice, and coordinated movement, assessed here by the ability of the mice to reorientate themselves on a vertical wire grid after inversion, was also maintained (data not shown). Loss of PrP expression due to Cre-mediated recombination in the hippocampi of NFH-Cre/tg37 mice after 8 wpi (or 9 weeks of age for uninfected mice) was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR for PrP mRNA expression at representative time points (Figure 2). We also tested the mice for changes in burrowing and nesting previously described in early prion infection. In the burrowing task, mice actively burrow in a container that is filled with objects, pushing or carrying them out into the cage until the container is almost emptied (Figure 3A). We found that all mice burrowed actively, displacing 70%–80% of the pellets in a 24 hr period at 6 (mean 78% ± 5 SEM) and 7 wpi (73% ± 4 SEM), respectively (Figure 3B). Mice burrowed less from 8 wpi (to a mean of 66% ± 6 for tg37 and 54% ± 7 for NFH-Cre/tg37 mice, falling to 42% ± 6 and 45% ± 6, respectively, at 9 wpi). The timing of onset of the impairment is consistent with observations in other prion-infected mouse strains (Cunningham et al., 2003Cunningham C. Deacon R. Wells H. Boche D. Waters S. Diniz C.P. Scott H. Rawlins J.N. Perry V.H. Synaptic changes characterize early behavioural signs in the ME7 model of murine prion disease.Eur. J.

Early behavioural changes in scrapie-affected mice and the influence of dapsone.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decline was significant for burrowing at 8 and 9 wpi compared to activity at 6 and 7 wpi for both tg37 mice and NFH-Cre/tg37 mice (p = 0.001 in each case). In tg37 mice, burrowing continued to decline until the mice reached onset of clinical disease, when they displaced just 21%–28% of pellets. In contrast, in mice with Cre-mediated PrP knockout, there was recovery of burrowing behavior by 10 wpi, which was significant when compared to control tg37 mice at this time point (p = 0.004) and highly significant at 12 wpi (p = 0.0001). The increase in burrowing activity in mice 10–14 wpi (post-PrP depletion) compared with the reduction seen in mice at the earlier time points of 8 and 9 wpi (prior to/around time of PrP depletion) was also significant (p = 0.001). Uninfected mice of both genotypes showed sustained burrowing activity when tested at representative time points pre- and post-PrP depletion (Figure S4). ANOVA analysis of all data to account for group effects confirmed significance of data; p < 0.0001. The later recovery of burrowing (at 10 wpi) compared to that of novel-object recognition (at 9 wpi) likely reflects the fact the animals were tested at the beginning of the week for burrowing and at the end for novel-object recognition, so that the actual difference in age at testing is ∼2–3 days. All mice constructed nests from nestlets up to 10 wpi, when tg37 mice then stopped shredding their nestlets. Mice with Cre-mediated PrP depletion did not show any change in this behavior at any stage. This is probably due to the fact that in this model nesting is affected relatively later than burrowing behavior in the disease process, when Cre-mediated recombination and reversal of early pathology has already occurred. As motor impairment is not a factor here, these data support a motivational—rather than a motor—impairment as a basis for loss of burrowing activity, as proposed by Deacon et al. (Deacon et al., 2001Deacon R.M.J. Raley J.M. Perry V.H. Rawlins J.N.P. Burrowing into prion disease.Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2053-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Histological examination of age-matched RML prion-infected mice confirmed absence of detectable prion pathological change at 6 and 7 wpi, when all mice showed normal learning, memory, and burrowing behavior (Figures 1C, panels A and D and Figures 4A–4C and 4J–4L). Loss of memory and burrowing correlated with the development of spongiform change in neurons at 8 wpi (Figure 1C, panels B and E), and recovery of these behaviors correlated with the reversal of spongiosis by 10 wpi in mice with PrP depletion (Figure 1C, panel F). Reduced levels of synaptophysin 1 in the dorsal hippocampus have been correlated with reduced burrowing behavior in prion-infected mice (Cunningham et al., 2003Cunningham C. Deacon R. Wells H. Boche D. Waters S. Diniz C.P. Scott H. Rawlins J.N. Perry V.H. Synaptic changes characterize early behavioural signs in the ME7 model of murine prion disease.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 2147-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We found marked loss of synaptophysin immunoreactivity throughout the hippocampus in tg37 mice from 10 wpi, most notable in regions CA1-3 (Figure 4, panel I). We also found reduction in total synaptophysin levels in scrapie sick tg37 animals on Western blotting of hippocampal homogenates (Figures S5A), but we did not detect reduced levels at earlier time points in correlation with behavioral change here (Figure S5B), suggesting that these behavioral deficits occur before there is significant loss of synapses structurally. Importantly, normal levels of synaptophysin immunoreactivity were maintained in infected NFH-Cre/tg37 mice up to 40 wpi (Figure 4, panel U), suggesting that synaptic integrity and density remains intact long term despite the extensive accumulation of non-neuronal PrPSc (Figure 4, panel T). We found that behavioral changes were paralleled by neurophysiological changes (Figure 5). We tested synaptic responses and plasticity in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region of hippocampal slices. At 8 wpi, both prion-infected tg37 and NFH-Cre/tg37 mice showed similar significant reductions in evoked excitatory postsynaptic field potentials (EPSPs) at ∼50% of values seen in both uninfected mice and in recovered NFH-Cre/tg37 animals (Figures 5A–5C). Cre-mediated neuronal PrP depletion in NFH-Cre/tg37 mice resulted in rapid recovery of EPSPs to control levels, a recovery sustained in mice examined up to 18 wpi. In contrast, synaptic responses in the prion-infected tg37 mice continued to decline, and at 9 wpi were 22% of those of uninfected control mice. The stimulus-response curves differed significantly between groups at different time points (p < 0.001, general linear model [GLM]; pair-wise differences described above as significant had p < 0.001 with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). Action potentials in the presynaptic axons give rise to “fiber volleys” (Winegar and MacIver, 2006Winegar B.D. MacIver M.B. Isoflurane depresses hippocampal CA1 glutamate nerve terminals without inhibiting fiber volleys.BMC Neurosci. 2006; 7 (Published online January 12, 2006): 5https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2202-7-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that can be seen immediately after the stimulus artifact. We found that the fiber volleys' amplitudes were linearly related to the EPSPs (correlation coefficient 0.97; Figure 6A), suggesting that the change in EPSP was directly due to a change in the presynaptic action potentials, rather than at a synaptic level.Figure 6Deficits in Synaptic Responses Correlate with Reduction in the Presynaptic Axonal Fiber Volley, but Synaptic Plasticity Is Preserved in Prion-Infected Mice, and They Display Normal Long-Term PotentiationShow full caption(A) The relationship between EPSP slope and fiber volley (FV) amplitude is unaltered during scrapie infectivity (linear regression, solid line, R2 = 0.97).

We also measured long-term potentiation (LTP) (Figure 6C and Figure S6), a form of synaptic plasticity linked with some forms of learning and memory. In all mice, LTP was sustained for at least 30 min despite differences in baseline (half-maximal) EPSPs between the experimental groups and the particularly low baseline values for tg37 mice at 9 wpi. As the EPSPs are expressed as a percentage of the mean preconditioning control values; the apparently greater LTP in the 9 wpi tg37 mice (Figure 6C) may be a result of this normalization (see also Figure S6). Overall, we found no reduction in LTP in prion-infected mice with or without PrP depletion. Our combined behavioral and neurophysiological analyses provide the first direct evidence (to our knowledge) for early neuronal dysfunction producing functional cognitive impairment in prion disease.

https://openalex.org/W2168140872,"Muscle regeneration following injury is characterized by myonecrosis accompanied by local inflammation, activation of satellite cells, and repair of injured fibers. The resolution of the inflammatory response is necessary to proceed toward muscle repair, since persistence of inflammation often renders the damaged muscle incapable of sustaining efficient muscle regeneration. Here, we show that local expression of a muscle-restricted insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 (mIGF-1) transgene accelerates the regenerative process of injured skeletal muscle, modulating the inflammatory response, and limiting fibrosis. At the molecular level, mIGF-1 expression significantly down-regulated proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta, and modulated the expression of CC chemokines involved in the recruitment of monocytes/macrophages. Analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that mIGF-1 expression modulated key players of inflammatory response, such as macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), high mobility group protein-1 (HMGB1), and transcription NF-kappaB. The rapid restoration of injured mIGF-1 transgenic muscle was also associated with connective tissue remodeling and a rapid recovery of functional properties. By modulating the inflammatory response and reducing fibrosis, supplemental mIGF-1 creates a qualitatively different environment for sustaining more efficient muscle regeneration and repair."
https://openalex.org/W2047703658,"bicoid messenger RNA localizes to the anterior of the Drosophila egg, where it is translated to form a morphogen gradient of Bicoid protein that patterns the head and thorax of the embryo. Although bicoid was the first localized cytoplasmic determinant to be identified, little is known about how the mRNA is coupled to the microtubule-dependent transport pathway that targets it to the anterior, and it has been proposed that the mRNA is recognized by a complex of many redundant proteins, each of which binds to the localization element in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) with little or no specificity. Indeed, the only known RNA-binding protein that co-localizes with bicoid mRNA is Staufen, which binds non-specifically to double-stranded RNA in vitro. Here we show that mutants in all subunits of the ESCRT-II complex (VPS22, VPS25 and VPS36) abolish the final Staufen-dependent step in bicoid mRNA localization. ESCRT-II is a highly conserved component of the pathway that sorts ubiquitinated endosomal proteins into internal vesicles, and functions as a tumour-suppressor by removing activated receptors from the cytoplasm. However, the role of ESCRT-II in bicoid localization seems to be independent of endosomal sorting, because mutations in ESCRT-I and III components do not affect the targeting of bicoid mRNA. Instead, VPS36 functions by binding directly and specifically to stem-loop V of the bicoid 3' UTR through its amino-terminal GLUE domain, making it the first example of a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein that recognizes the bicoid localization signal. Furthermore, VPS36 localizes to the anterior of the oocyte in a bicoid-mRNA-dependent manner, and is required for the subsequent recruitment of Staufen to the bicoid complex. This function of ESCRT-II as an RNA-binding complex is conserved in vertebrates and may clarify some of its roles that are independent of endosomal sorting."
https://openalex.org/W2146162156,"Genome-wide gene expression profiling of skeletal muscle from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients has been used to describe muscle tissue alterations in DMD children older than 5 years. By studying the expression profile of 19 patients younger than 2 years, we describe with high resolution the gene expression signature that characterizes DMD muscle during the initial or ""presymptomatic"" phase of the disease. We show that in the first 2 years of the disease, DMD muscle is already set to express a distinctive gene expression pattern considerably different from the one expressed by normal, age-matched muscle. This ""dystrophic"" molecular signature is characterized by a coordinate induction of genes involved in the inflammatory response, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and muscle regeneration, and the reduced transcription of those involved in energy metabolism. Despite the lower degree of muscle dysfunction experienced, our younger patients showed abnormal expression of most of the genes reported as differentially expressed in more advanced stages of the disease. By analyzing our patients as a time series, we provide evidence that some genes, including members of three pathways involved in morphogenetic signaling-Wnt, Notch, and BMP-are progressively induced or repressed in the natural history of DMD."
https://openalex.org/W2153332657,"It is increasingly acknowledged that migratory birds, notably waterfowl, play a critical role in the maintenance and spread of influenza A viruses. In order to elucidate the epidemiology of influenza A viruses in their natural hosts, a better understanding of the pathological effects in these hosts is required. Here we report on the feeding and migratory performance of wild migratory Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii Yarrell) naturally infected with low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A viruses of subtypes H6N2 and H6N8. Using information on geolocation data collected from Global Positioning Systems fitted to neck-collars, we show that infected swans experienced delayed migration, leaving their wintering site more than a month after uninfected animals. This was correlated with infected birds travelling shorter distances and fuelling and feeding at reduced rates. The data suggest that LPAI virus infections in wild migratory birds may have higher clinical and ecological impacts than previously recognised."

Ultrastructural analysis revealed abnormally dense lamellar body-like organelles and no normal lamellar bodies in Abca3–/– alveolar type II cells.

Pulmonary surfactant reduces surface tension at the air-liquid interface thereby preventing end-expiratory collapse of the alveoli of the lung.

Pulmonary surfactant is composed mainly of lipids, mostly phospholipids, and specific proteins including surfactant proteins (SP)-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D (8Rooney S.A. Young S.L. Mendelson C.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), which contain palmitic acid, especially dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol, are uniquely abundant in the surfactant lipid component (9Hallman M.

The lipid and protein components are assembled in lamellar bodies, from which they are secreted into the alveolar space. However, the mechanism by which surfactant lipids are packaged in the lamellar body is not known. We reported earlier that ABCA3, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, is expressed exclusively in alveolar type II cells and is localized mostly at the limiting membrane of the lamellar bodies in human lung (12Yamano G. Funahashi H. Kawanami O. Zhao L.X. Ban N. Uchida Y. Morohoshi T. Ogawa J. Shioda S. Inagaki N. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We also found that ABCA3 protein expression is dramatically increased just before birth and is up-regulated by glucocorticoids (13Yoshida I. Ban N. Inagaki N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As various members of the A subfamily of ABC transporters such as ABCA1 and ABCA4 have been shown to be involved in lipid transport (14Schmitz G. Langmann T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 15Oram J.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 16Allikmets R. Am.

Recently, various mutations in the ABCA3 gene have been reported in full-term newborns with RDS (17Shulenin S. Nogee L.M. Annilo T. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dean M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 1296-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) and in children with interstitial lung disease (18Bullard J.E. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dean M. Nogee L.M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 172: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), indicating an important role of ABCA3 in human lung disease. However, the function of ABCA3 protein and the underlying mechanism of lung disease due to ABCA3 gene mutation remain unknown. In the present study, to investigate the function of ABCA3 and its role in pulmonary surfactant biogenesis, we generated Abca3-deficient mice by homologous recombination and narrowed down the candidate substrates of ABCA3 protein by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS) analysis of lipids extracted from Abca3–/– lung. This approach should be useful in identifying the substrates of other orphan ABC transporters involved in lipid transport. Construction of the Targeting Vector and Generation of Abca3–/– Mice—Mouse genomic DNA for the targeting construct for Abca3 was cloned by screening a mouse strain 129Sv λ genomic library (Stratagene) with a probe from the human ABCA3 cDNA fragment. Six clones of ∼19 kb containing the four exons encoding the first nucleotide-binding domain of ABCA3 were isolated, restriction-mapped, and partially sequenced. An 889-bp PCR fragment and a 9.9-kb XhoI-SalI fragment were used as the 5′ short arm and 3′ long arm, respectively. These arms were inserted on either side of the PGK-neo cassette containing the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (Neor) under control of the mouse phosphoglycerate kinase (pGK) promoter in pBluescript. External to the 3′-region of homology with the target locus was placed a negatively selectable marker gene, driven diphtheria toxin A (DT-A), under control of the MC1 promoter. E14 embryonic stem (ES) cells were cultured with the mouse embryonic fibroblasts as feeder cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1,000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor. For transfection, 1 × 107 ES cells were electroporated with 100 μg of the linearized targeting construct at 250 V, 500 microfarads in an 0.4-cm cuvette by using a Bio-Rad gene pulsar and then selected in the presence of 300 μg/ml G418 (Nacalai tesque). Colonies surviving positive/negative selection were isolated. Targeted ES clones were identified by PCR screening with primers ABCA3-S4 (5′-GCATTTGTAATGACACGTAG-3′) and Neo-S3 (5′-AGCTCATTCCTCCCACTCATG-3′) and verified by genomic Southern blot analysis using the 5′-external probe and the 3′-probe. Targeted ES clones were microinjected into C57BL/6J blastocysts, yielding chimeric mice that transmitted the targeted mutation through the germ line. Male chimeras were crossed with female C57BL/6J mice to generate heterozygous mice. Mice used in the experiments were obtained by intercrossing heterozygotes. The mice were maintained in the animal facility under specific pathogen-free conditions, and all animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Akita University School of Medicine. DNA Blot Analysis—Genomic DNA from mouse tail was digested with BamHI for the 5′-probe and with ClaI for the 3′-probe, separated by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose, and transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were hybridized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled probe. The probe was detected by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody (Amersham Biosciences). PCR Analysis—Targeted ES clones were identified by PCR screening with primers ABCA3-S4 and Neo-S3 and AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCR condition was 94 °C for 9 min, 50 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final elongation step at 72 °C for 7 min. Mouse genotypes were determined by PCR amplification of tail DNA. The wild-type Abca3 allele was characterized by amplification of a 477-bp fragment with sense primer ABCA3-S6 (5′-GCTCTTAGGAACGAGTACTTTGAAG-3′) and antisense primer ABCA3-AS9 (5′-TTGGAACACCTGCAGGTAAG-3′). On the other hand, a 350-bp fragment of mutated ABCA3 was amplified with the same sense primer (ABCA3-S6) and antisense primer Neo-S4 (5′-ATTAAGGGCCAGCTCATTC-3′) and ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara). The PCR condition was 94 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 62.5 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final elongation step at 72 °C for 7 min. Immunohistochemistry—The lungs were fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 m phosphate buffer at 4 °C. The tissue was immersed in increasing concentrations of sucrose solution up to 20% and rapidly frozen in an embedding Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical) at –80 °C until used. 5-μm-thick sections were prepared with a cryostat (Leica) and transferred to aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated Superfrost slide glass (Matsunami). The lung sections were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin and 1% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 1% normal goat serum, and 1:500-diluted anti-mouse F4/80 antigen rat antibody (MCA497R; Serotec). After incubation, the sections were immunostained by the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) followed by incubation with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) for 5 min. The sections were mounted and observed with a light microscope (AxioCam HRc, Carl Zeiss). Immunoblot Analysis—Crude lung proteins were prepared, and immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (19Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement IV, J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). After blocking, the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was incubated with 1:1000-diluted anti-mouse ABCA3 rabbit antibody (13Yoshida I. Ban N. Inagaki N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), 1:1000-diluted anti-mouse SP-A rabbit antibody (sc-13977; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:1000-diluted anti-mouse SP-B rabbit antibody (AB3780; Chemicon), 1:1000-diluted anti-mouse SP-C rabbit antibody (sc-13979; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:1000-diluted anti-mouse SP-D rabbit antibody (AB3434; Chemicon), and 1:1000-diluted anti-β-tubulin isotype I + II mouse IgG2b (T8535; Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. As the secondary antibody, 1:50000-diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig or 1:20000-diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse F(ab′)2 (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) advance Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Electron Microscopic Analysis—Lung tissue dissected from wild-type and Abca3–/– mice was fixed overnight at 6 °C in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 3% glutaraldehyde. The fixed tissues were treated with 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide for 1 h and stained en bloc with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 2 h. The specimens were then dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in Spurr resin. 80-nm sections were cut on a Reichert Ultracut S ultramicrotome, collected on Formvar-coated copper oval slot grids, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The sections were examined using an advanced transmission electron microscope H-7650 (Hitachi). TLC and Quantitative Analysis of Lipids—The isolated lung tissues were homogenized in distilled water by a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer to obtain whole lung homogenate from wild-type and Abca3–/– mice. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was prepared by bronchial intubation of phosphate-buffered saline in wild-type mice. As a practical alternative to BALF, the isolated lung tissue was cut into small pieces, digested by collagenase at 37 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected as the interstitial fraction. Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42694) Google Scholar). For phospholipid analysis, aliquots of the solubilized lipids were developed on Silica gel 60 TLC plates (Merck, 20 × 20 cm) using two-dimensional solvent systems; the first and the second chromatographic runs were performed with chloroform:methanol:7 m ammonia (65:30:4 (v/v)) and with chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (170:25:25:4 (v/v)) at –90° in the original direction. After development, the plates were sprayed with primuline (0.001 (w/v) in acetone-water (4:1)) and viewed under UV light (365 nm) for localization of separated compounds. Each lipid spot on the TLC plate was scraped off using a razor, and the spots of each phospholipid were then extracted from silica gel by chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.8 (v/v)). For measurement of the amount of inorganic phosphate in phospholipids, individual phospholipids extracted from silica gel were digested in perchloric acid (70%) for 90 min at 200 °C. The inorganic phosphate was quantified colorimetrically (21Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). The calibration curves were prepared by using potassium dihydrogen phosphate as a standard. The amount of cholesterol contained in total lipids was measured using an enzymatic assay kit (Kyowa Medex) as described previously (22Abe-Dohmae S. Ikeda Y. Matsuo M. Hayashi M. Okuhira K. Ueda K. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 604-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). ESI/MS Analysis—The lipids of the interstitial fraction of lung tissues was extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem.

The content of choline phospholipids in the interstitial fraction of lung tissues was analyzed by mass spectrometry. MS analysis was performed according to previous reports (23Taguchi R. Hayakawa J.

Phospholipid molecular species were separated and analyzed using normal-phase Cap-liquid chromatography ESI-MS with a silica column (Deverosil Si60, 150 × 0.3 mm inner diameter, 5 μm particle size, Nomura Chemicals, Nagoya, Japan). The samples were provided by UltiMate high performance liquid chromatography system (Dionex Corp.) into the electrospray interface at a flow rate of 4 μl/min. For both positive and negative ionization, the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile/methanol (2:1) containing 0.1% ammonium formate (pH 6.4) (solvent A) and methanol/water (2:1) containing 0.1% ammonium formate (pH 6.4) (solvent B). At the beginning of the gradient, the mobile phase was 100% acetonitrile. After 5 min, the mobile phase was changed from 100% acetonitrile to solvent A-B (90:10). Solvent B was increased to 40% after 20 min. The mobile phase was then held constant for 15 min. The flow rate of the nitrogen drying gas was 12 liters/min at 80 °C. The capillary and cone voltages were set at 3.7 kV and 30 V, respectively, argon at 3–4 × 104 torr was used as the collision gas, and a collision energy of 30–40 V was used to obtain fragment ions for precursor ions. The relationship between peak height and amount of PC and PG was examined using di-14:1 PC and di-14:0 PG. Statistical Analysis—Two-tailed Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance of experimental results. Generation of Abca3–/– Mice—We generated abca3-deficient mice by homologous recombination, which resulted in disruption of the four exons encoding the first nucleotide-binding domain of the ABCA3 protein. The targeting construct depicted in Fig. 1A was transfected into E14 ES cells, and a targeting frequency of 2% (4 of 196) was observed in clones that survived G418 and DT-A selection. Blastocyst injection of two clones resulted in the birth of seven high-percentage male chimeras. Transmission of the mutant allele was confirmed by PCR analysis and DNA blotting analysis using the 5′- and 3′-probes, which were set in the external region of the targeting construct (Fig. 1, A–C). To test for protein expression, we performed immunoblot analysis on proteins prepared from the lungs of wild-type, Abca3+/–, and Abca3–/– mice at birth, using the anti-mouse ABCA3 antibody. Immunoreactivity was detected in isolated lungs in wild-type and Abca3+/– mice but not in those of Abca3–/– mice (Fig. 1D). These results demonstrate that ABCA3 protein is absent in Abca3–/– lung due to knock-out of the Abca3 gene. Phenotype of Abca3–/– Mice—Heterozygous crosses showed that the distribution of the three genotypes (+/+, +/–, –/–) was according to Mendelian inheritance (187:374:174). Heterozygous Abca3+/– mice were indistinguishable from normal littermates and showed normal growth, development, and reproduction. In contrast, no homozygous Abca3–/– mice survived the neonatal period but died of acute respiratory failure shortly after birth (Fig. 2A and supplemental video). The Abca3–/– pups were of normal size and body weight at birth compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 2B). Normal respiration was initiated at birth in both wild-type and Abca3+/– mice, which became pink and rapidly inflated their lungs as assessed by the appearance of a white patch on the thorax signaling the inflated lung. On the other hand, all Abca3–/– mice initiated normal respiratory effort at birth but failed to inflate their lungs, remaining cyanotic and succumbing within an hour. At autopsy, the isolated Abca3–/– lung appeared to be congestive and poorly inflated, and wet lung weight was significantly increased by 32% compared with that of the wild type (Fig. 2, A and B). No pathological conditions were observed in other organs of Abca3–/– pups. Histological examination of lungs from Abca3–/– mice revealed extensive atelectasis and pulmonary congestion (Fig. 2, C–F), findings consistent with acute RDS. In addition, immunoreactivity of F4/80 antigen, a selective marker of pulmonary macrophage, was not increased in the peripheral lung saccules of Abca3–/– mice compared with those of the wild type (supplemental figure). During the saccular period of fetal lung morphogenesis, the terminal buds dilate, the mesenchyme and epithelium become thinner, and there is an extensive ingrowth of pulmonary capillaries in close proximity to squamous respiratory epithelial type I cells as the gas exchange surface of the lung forms. At birth, the peripheral lung of wild-type mice consisted of saccules lined by both squamous type I cells and cuboidal type II cells, indicating structural maturation (Fig. 2, C and E). By contrast, in the lungs of Abca3–/– mice, the dilation of peripheral saccules was reduced, the mesenchyme remained thickened, and the peripheral saccules were lined by cuboidal epithelial cells with no typical squamous type I cells (Fig. 2, D and F), findings consistent with pulmonary immaturity (25Burri P.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1984; 46: 617-628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that immature type II cells are glycogen-rich and that, as they differentiate, glycogen is converted into phospholipids and mobilized to lamellar bodies (26Bourbon J.R. Rieutort M. Engle M.J. Farrell P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Ridsdale R. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: L743-L751Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Sections from Abca3–/– lung display increased levels of periodic acid-Schiff staining in bronchiolar epithelium, indicated by the red deposit (Fig. 2, H and I), compared with their control littermates (Fig. 2G). These results suggest that maturation of epithelial cells is impaired in Abca3–/– lung. It is well known that expression of surfactant proteins SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D in alveolar type II cells in the peripheral lung normally increases prior to birth (28Batenburg J.J. Whitsett J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In particular, the hydrophobic SP-B and SP-C play crucial roles in surfactant function and homeostasis (29Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 2141-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar); the proteins enhance the spreading, adsorption, and stability of surfactant lipids required for the reduction of surface tension in the alveolus, and mutations in the genes encoding SP-B and SP-C are associated with acute respiratory failure (30Nogee L.M. de Mello D.E. Dehner L.P. Colten H.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) and interstitial lung diseases (31Nogee L.M. Dunbar A.E. II I Wert S.E. Askin F. Hamvas A. Whitsett J.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar), respectively. Therefore, we verified the expression levels of surfactant proteins using immunoblot analysis. Expressions of SP-A, prepro-SP-B, pro-SP-C, and SP-D proteins were readily detected in lung homogenate of Abca3–/– mice and were indistinguishable from those in wild-type mice. In contrast, mature SP-C protein was not detected in lung homogenate of Abca3–/– mice (Fig. 2J), suggesting that disruption of the Abca3 gene causes aberrant processing of pro-SP-C resulting in a deficiency of mature SP-C protein in Abca3–/– lung. In this regard, Abca3–/– mice resemble SP-B–/– mice and human infants with hereditary SP-B deficiency, in both of which mature SP-C is deficient (32Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T.

Physiol. 1995; 268: L647-L656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ultrastructural Analysis of Alveolar Type II Cells in Abca3–/– Mice—At the ultrastructural level, alveolar type II cells with apical microvilli were found to contain numerous lamellar bodies in control wild-type mice (Fig. 3A). By contrast, fully formed lamellar bodies were not detected, and only lamellar body-like organelles were observed in alveolar type II cells of Abca3–/– mice. Lamellar body-like organelles are smaller than those observed fully formed in wild-type mice and have eccentrically placed, dense inclusions (Fig. 3, B and C). This is consistent with observations in the lung tissue of a newborn patient with fatal RDS with ABCA3 mutation (17Shulenin S. Nogee L.M. Annilo T. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dean M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 1296-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) and in differentiating human fetal lung alveolar type II cells in which endogenous ABCA3 is knocked down with small interfering RNA (34Cheong N. Madesh M. Gonzales L.W. Zhao M. Yu K. Ballard P.L. Shuman H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9791-9800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Clearly, ABCA3 protein is involved in the metabolism of the lipid components of pulmonary surfactant and is critical in surfactant biogenesis and lamellar body formation. Lipid Composition in Interstitial Fraction of Abca3–/– Lung—To clarify the function of ABCA3, we compared the composition of surfactant lipids in lung tissues of wild-type and Abca3–/– mice. To determine the composition of secreted surfactant lipids, we attempted to obtain the lipids in BALF from both wild-type and Abca3–/– mice at birth. Although BALF could be obtained from wild-type and Abca3+/– mice, we were unable to obtain BALF from Abca3–/– mice, because injection of phosphate-buffered saline into alveolar space was impossible, perhaps because of increased surface tension at the alveolar air-liquid interface or morphological abnormalities in the peripheral lung. Therefore, rather than BALF, we examined the interstitial fraction of lung tissue prepared by collagenase digestion. Crude lipids extracted from the interstitial fraction were separated by two-dimensional TLC analysis (Fig. 4A). By quantification of phospholipid phosphorus, the amounts of PC and PG in the interstitial fraction of Abca3–/– lung were dramatically decreased 63 and 96%, respectively, compared with those of wild-type mice. In addition, the ratio of these lipids relative to total phospholipids in Abca3–/– lung also was significantly lower than that in wild-type mice (PC, 55.7% in Abca3–/– versus 69.2% in wild type, p < 0.001; PG, 0.6% in Abca3–/– versus 4.5% in wild type, p < 0.001). The amount of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) was moderately but significantly decreased 45% in Abca3–/– mice compared with that of wild type, but the ratio of PE relative to total phospholipids was not significantly different in Abca3–/– and wild-type lung (11.1 versus 9.4%, respectively; p = 0.478). Thus, it was unclear whether the decrease in the amount of PE in Abca3–/– lung was significant. On the other hand, the amounts of total cholesterol and other phospholipids from Abca3–/– lung were not different from those of wild-type lung (Fig. 4A). These results demonstrate that secretion of PC and PG is impaired in Abca3–/– lung, suggesting these phospholipids as substrates of the ABCA3 transporter. Surfactant contains a large amount of PC (70–80% of total phospholipids); PG, which accounts for less than 2% of total phospholipids in other tissues, is the second major phospholipid in surfactant, accounting for as much as 10% of phospholipid content (9Hallman M. Gluck L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 409: 172-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11Rooney S.A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 131: 439-460PubMed Google Scholar). Especially PC and PG, both of which contain palmitic acid, are abundant in lamellar bodies, accounting for 70% of total PC and 50% of total PG, respectively (10Magoon M.W. Wright J.R. Baritussio A. Williams M.C. Goerke J. Benson B.J. Hamilton R.L. Clements J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 750: 18-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 11Rooney S.A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 131: 439-460PubMed Google Scholar), and are crucial in reducing surface tension at the alveolar air-liquid interface. Very recently, the ratio of PC in total surfactant phospholipids extracted from BALF in patients with ABCA3 gene mutation has been reported to be decreased compared with control (35Garmany T.H. Moxley M.A. White F.V. Dean M. Hull W.M. Whitsett J.A. Nogee L.M. Hamvas A. Pediatr. Res. 2006; 59: 801-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which is consistent with our data. To further determine which species of PC and PG are decreased, ESI/MS analysis was conducted on the interstitial fraction from wild-type and Abca3–/– lung tissue. Among the PC species from Abca3–/– lung, 14:0–16:0 PC, 16:0–16:1 PC, and 16:0–16:0 PC were dramatically decreased by about 80%, whereas 16:0–18:1 PC and 16:0–22:6 PC were moderately and significantly decreased by 30 and 60%, respectively, compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 4B). Among the PG species in Abca3–/– lung, 16:0–16:1 PG, 16:0–16:0 PG, 16:0–18:1 PG, 16:0–20:4 PG, and 16:0–22:6 PG were dramatically decreased by more than 80% compared with wild-type lung (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, differences in the amounts of PE species were not obvious between Abca3–/– and wild-type lung (data not shown). These results demonstrate that PC and PG, both of which contain palmitic acid, are specifically decreased in Abca3–/– lung. Very recently, Fitzgerald et al. (36Fitzgerald M.L. Xavier R. Haley K.J. Welti R. Goss J.L. Brown C.E. Zhuang D.Z. Bell S.A. Lu N. McKee M. Seed B. Freeman M.W. J. Lipid Res. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar) reported ABCA3 knock-out mice showing a phenotype similar to that of our Abca3–/– mice. They analyzed the lipid components of total lung homogenates at embryonic day 18.5, when expression of endogenous ABCA3 protein is extremely low (13Yoshida I. Ban N. Inagaki N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We analyzed the interstitial fraction, which represents secreted surfactant, just after birth. In addition, by analyzing the acyl chain using tandem mass spectrometry analysis, we clearly show that PC and PG, especially those species containing palmitic acid, are dramatically decreased. We also found that mature SP-C protein was not detected in lung homogenate of Abca3–/– lung, suggesting that disruption of the Abca3 gene causes aberrant processing of pro-SP-C. In addition, we examined the effect of overexpression of ABCA3 protein on phospholipids levels in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells and found that the choline-phospholipid level in intracellular LAMP3-positive vesicles in A549 cells stably expressing ABCA3 protein is increased compared with that in untransfected A549 cells, 3Y. Matsumura, H. Sakai, M. Sasaki, N. Ban, and N. Inagaki, unpublished data. which supports these data. However, the effect of overexpression of ABCA3 on the PG level remains uncertain, as PG barely exists in A549 cells. In summary, we have determined by TLC and ESI/MS analysis of lipids extracted from Abca3–/– lung that PC and PG, which contain palmitic acid, are candidate substrates of ABCA3 protein. This approach should be helpful in the investigation of substrates of other orphan ABC transporters involved in lipid transport. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2107438214,"The role of cytosolic calcium oscillation has long been recognized in the regulation of cellular and molecular interactions. Information embedded in calcium oscillation can provide molecular cues for cell behavior such as cell differentiation. Although calcium dynamics are versatile and likely to depend on the cell type, the calcium dynamics in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and its role in differentiation are yet to be fully elucidated. In the present study we characterized the calcium oscillation profiles in hMSCs before and after subjecting the cells to the osteoinductive factors. Our findings indicate that the calcium spikes decreased rapidly with osteodifferentiation to a level observed in terminally differentiated human osteoblasts. In addition, the calcium oscillations appear to serve as a bidirectional signal during hMSC differentiation. While an altered calcium oscillation pattern may be an indicator for hMSC differentiation, it is also likely to be involved in directing hMSC differentiation. Treatment of hMSCs with a noninvasive electrical stimulation, for example, not only altered the calcium oscillations but also facilitated osteodifferentiation. Regulation of calcium oscillation by external physical stimulation could amplify hMSC differentiation into a tissue-specific lineage and may offer an alternate biotechnology to harness the unique properties of stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2057743013,"Upon drug activation, the nuclear pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulates not only hepatic drug but also energy metabolism. Using Pxr–/– mice, we have now investigated the PXR-mediated repression of lipid metabolism in the fasting livers. Treatment with PXR activator pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile (PCN) down-regulated the mRNA levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (in β-oxidation) and mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate-CoA synthase 2 (in ketogenesis) in wild-type (Pxr+/+) mice only. In contrast, the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (in lipogenesis) mRNA was up-regulated in the PCN-treated Pxr+/+ mice. Reflecting these up- and down-regulations and consistent with decreased energy metabolism, the levels of hepatic triglycerides and of serum 3-hydroxybutylate were increased and decreased, respectively, in the PCN-treated Pxr+/+ mice. Using gel shift, glutathione S-transferase pull-down and cell-based reporter assays, we then examined whether PXR could cross-talk with the insulin response forkhead factor FoxA2 to repress the transcription of the Cpt1a and Hmgcs2 genes, because FoxA2 activates these genes in fasting liver. PXR directly bound to FoxA2 and repressed its activation of the Cpt1a and Hmgcs2 promoters. Moreover, ChIP assays showed that PCN treatment attenuated the binding of FoxA2 to these promoters in fasting Pxr+/+ but not Pxr–/– mice.

The molecular mechanism through which CAR and PXR mediate the drug-induced repression of energy metabolism is currently of high research interest. The liver is the major organ that metabolizes lipids to produce energy sources.

J. 1999; 338: 569-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 24Louet J.F. Le May C. Pegorier J.P. Decaux J.F. Girard J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 310-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, FoxA2, a winged-helix/forkhead transcription factor, is found to be the key regulatory factor that activates these genes in fasting mouse liver (25Wolfrum C. Asilmaz E. Luca E. Friedman J.M. Stoffel M. Nature. 2004; 432: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Insulin decreases lipid metabolism by inactivating the transcription factor FoxA2 to control energy metabolism (26Wolfrum C. Besser D. Luca E. Stoffel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11624-11629Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 27Wang H. Wollheim C.B. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 262-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Treatment with drugs such as phenobarbital can modulate lipid metabolism in an insulin-independent manner by changing the expression of many genes under control of insulin signaling cascade (28Kiyosawa N. Tanaka K. Hirao J. Ito K. Niino N. Sakuma K. Kanbori M. Yamoto T. Manabe S. Matsunuma N. Arch. Toxicol. 2004; 78: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting that there may be cross-talk between the xenobiotic-sensing transcription and insulin-regulated transcription factors. Recently, the molecular mechanism by which both CAR and PXR decrease gluconeogenesis was elucidated. Both receptors directly bind to FoxO1, preventing its interaction with the insulin response sequence and repressing the FoxO1-mediated activation of IRS-bearing genes such as Pepck1 (17Kodama S. Koike C. Negishi M. Yamamoto Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7931-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which CAR and PXR represses lipid metabolism remains unexplored. We have investigated the molecular mechanism of PXR-mediated regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism in fasting mouse. Pxr–/– mice were used to demonstrate that the activation of PXR down-regulated the key enzymes in β-oxidation and ketogenesis, CPT1A, and HMGCS2, respectively, while up-regulating stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), the key enzyme in lipogenesis. By cloning and characterizing the promoters of the mouse Cpt1a and Hmgcs2 genes, we deciphered the repression mechanism by PXR of FoxA2-mediated transcription of these genes. Here we present experimental considerations to propose the regulatory mechanism by which the drug activation of PXR can result in decreased energy metabolism by up-regulating lipogenesis and by down-regulating β-oxidation and ketogenesis in fasting mouse liver. Materials—Me2SO and pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile (PCN) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The plasmids pGL3-basic, pBIND, and pACT were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. Plasmid Construction—pGem1/rat FOXA2/Hnf3β and 6xFoxA TATA-Luc were kindly provided by Robert H.

Rat FoxA2 coding DNA was amplified using proper primer sets with pGem1/rat Hnf3β/FoxA2 as the template and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-Topo (Invitrogen), pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), and pACT to generate pcDNA3.1/FoxA2, pGEX/FoxA2, and pACT/FoxA2, respectively. pBind/mPXR were constructed by cloning of mPXR into pBIND. The following deletion mutants were also constructed based on a previous report (29Rausa F.M. Tan Y. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell.

Reporter plasmids pGL3/CPT1a-2.4k and pGL3/HMGCS2–3.0k were constructed using PCR amplified Cpt1a promoter (–2432 to +1) and Hmgcs2 promoter (–2984 to +40) from mouse genomic DNA, respectively. Primers used for these cloning were 5′-GCATATCTCGAGAGATCACTCAAGCTGGCCTCAAACTTGTGG-3′ and 5′-TTCTTGAAGCTTCTTGGAGGAGGGGCAAGAGATGGCTTTGAG for Cpt1a and 5′-GCATATGGTACCTCTACTACAATAAGACATGGCAGAGG-3′ and 5′-CGGCTACTCGAGATCAACAGAAAGCCAGCAGTCCACAG-3′ for Hmgcs2. The amplified DNA fragments are cloned into pGL3 basic at XhoI-HindIII and KpnI-XhoI sites, respectively, utilizing the recognition sequences incorporated in the primers as indicated by underlines. Cell Culture and Transfection—HepG2 and Huh7 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells on 24-wells plates were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were treated with drug in the media without fetal bovine serum for an additional 24 h before harvest. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and normalized against Renilla reniformis luciferase activity from pRL-CMV (10 ng/well, Promega). The experiments were carried out in triplicate, and the results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—A mammalian two-hybrid assay was performed using the CheckMate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression plasmids for GAL4 DNA binding domain (pBIND) fusion protein and VP16 (pACT) fusion protein were co-transfected into HepG2 cells with pG5Luc reporter plasmid, and luciferase activity was determined as described above. GST Pull-down Assay—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, GST-FoxA2, GST-FoxA2-(7–94), GST-FoxA2-(144–279), and GST-FoxA2-(361–458) were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 cells and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). mPXR, mPXR DBD, mPXR LBD, and mPXR ΔAF2 were labeled with [35S]methionine using the TnT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). GST-FoxA2 was incubated with 35S-labeled mPXR or the mutants, and then a GST pull-down procedure was performed as previously reported (32Kobayashi K. Sueyoshi T. Inoue K. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were detected by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE separation. Gel Shifts—PXR, RXR, and FoxA2 proteins were produced by in vitro translation using appropriate expression plasmid and the TnT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system. For the probes, double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a FoxA2 binding site of hIGFBP-1 promoter at the position –124 to –96 (5′-GATCCACTAGCAAAACAAACTTATTTTGAACACGATC-3′) (33Allander S.V.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4291-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the putative FoxA2 binding sites within Cpt1a promoter, C1 at the position –1910 to –1886 (5′-GATCAAGCTAAACAGGCATGATC-3′), C2 at the position –1823 to –1809 (5′-GATCCATATAAATATGCAGGATC-3′), C3 at the position –1733 to –1719 (5′-GATCATACCTATTGGTTTTGATC-3′), the binding sites within Hmgcs2 promoter, H1 at the position –179 to –162 (5′-GATCAAGGCCAACAATGAAGATC-3′), and H2 at the position –112 to –98 (5′-GATCCATGATGTTTTCCTTGATC-3′) were labeled with [α-32P]dATP and DNA polymerase Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs). The underlined sequences indicate additional sequences that were filled in by Klenow fragment. Gel shift assays were carried out as described previously (1Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Animal Treatments—All animals were housed in a room maintained at 22 °C with a 12:12-h light/dark cycle (7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.). Mice were fed ad libitum with NIH-31 the Open Formula Autoclavable diet (Zeigler). PXR wild-type (Pxr+/+) or null (Pxr–/–) mice (10 weeks old) obtained from Jeff L. Staudinger were randomly divided into two groups, and mice were intraperitoneally treated with PCN (20 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle only (Me2SO). After injection, mice (four mice per group) were fasted with food withdrawn and drinking water provided ad libitum until sacrifice. All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee NIEHS, National Institutes of Health. Real-time PCR—Mouse liver cDNAs were prepared using the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems) with total RNA prepared with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed with the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with the following probes and primers: 5′-6FAM-ACCCTAGACACCACTGGCCGCATGT-TAMRA-3′, 5′-CCCTGGGCATGATTGCAA-3′, 5′-AAGAGGACGCCACTCACGAT-3′ for Cpt1a; 5′-6FAMCATCACGGCCAATGTTATCTGCTCCA-TAMRA-3′, 5′-ACCCCACGTTCCTCTTCCA-3′, and 5′-CAGCAGGCGCAAGAACTGA-3′ for Cyp2b10 (34Kakizaki S. Karami S. Negishi M. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2002; 30: 208-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, the following pre-synthesized probes from Applied Biosystems were used: Cyp3a11, Mm00731567_m1; Foxa2, Mm00839704_mH; Hmgcs2, Mm00550050_ml; Srebp1, Mm00550338_m1; Fasn, Mm00662319_m1; Acc1, Mm01304260_m1; Scd1, Mm00772290_m1; Mttp, Mm01321412_g1; Dgat2, Mm00499530_m1; Cpt2, Mm00432403_01; and Ppara; Mm00440939_m1. The TaqMan rodent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control reagent (Applied Biosystems) was used as internal control. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP assays were performed according to the method previously reported (35Ishii S. Iizuka K. Miller B.C. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15597-15602Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The liver nuclei were prepared according to previously reported method (36Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Nuclear pellets were suspended with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3 mm MgCl2 and treated with 1.0% formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min for cross-linking. To quench the reaction, glycine (final concentration, 125 mm) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3 mm MgCl2, the nuclei were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1.0% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and one Complete protease inhibitor minitablet (Roche Diagnostics) per 10 ml) for 10 min on ice, and the nuclear lysate was sonicated to shear chromosomal DNA to a size of average 500 bp. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the soluble supernatant solution (200 μl) was diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and one Complete protease inhibitor minitablet per 10 ml). The diluted chromatin was precleared by incubating for 4 h with 4 mg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, 40 μl of pre-immune serum, and 25 μl of Protein G-agarose beads saturated with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). The mixture was spun at 3000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was allowed to bind to either 5 μg of normal goat IgG or anti-FOXA2 antibody (Imgenex Co.) overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes on protein G-agarose were pulled down and washed four times with the ChIP dilution buffer. DNA precipitated in the anti-FOXA2 antibody complex was decross-linked, eluted by incubating at 65 °C for at 6 h, and treated with Proteinase K for 2 h at 42°C. The purified DNAs using QIAquick DNA purification columns (Qiagen) were used for semi-quantitative PCR analysis using [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences) with gene-specific primers as follows. 5′-TACAGCCTAGAACCCTGACTGC-3′ and 5′-CTTTCCTACTGAGGCCCAGATAG-3′ for Cpt1a promoter; 5′-TGAGCCACTCAGCAGAGGAATCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGGGTTGGGCTTTATAAGACTCC-3′ for Hmgcs2 promoter. Serum and Liver Parameters Analysis—Blood samples were collected from the submandibular cheek pouch area of mice, using 5.5-mm Golden Rod animal lancets (Medipoint, Inc.) and a micotainer Serum Separator Tube (BD Biosciences). The serum levels of triglyceride, non-esterified fatty acid and 3-hydroxybutylate were measured using assay kits (L-type TG H, non-esterified fatty acid C, and Autokit 3-HB, respectively) from Wako Chemicals, Inc. Serum glucose and cholesterol were measured using reagents and controls from Olympus America Inc. and the chemistry-immuno AU400e analyzer (Olympus). Serum levels of insulin and glucagon were quantified using RIA kits for these hormones from Linco Research, Inc. Total liver lipids were extracted from homogenate prepared from 100 mg of liver using methanol-chloroform (1:2, v/v) according to Bligh and Dyer's method (37Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the chloroform fraction was collected and dried. The remaining pellet was dissolved in 10% SDS in isopropanol, and triglyceride was assayed using L-type TG H (Wako Chemicals). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed by using Student's t test for the drug responses in Pxr+/+ mice or Pxr–/– mice and the differences between Pxr+/+ mice and Pxr–/– mice. Regulation of the Cpt1a, Hmgcs2, and Scd1 Genes—First, we have measured the expression of Cpt1a and Hmgcs2, which are known to be regulated by FoxA2, in mouse liver. Consistent with previous reports (23Hegardt F.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 569-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 24Louet J.F. Le May C. Pegorier J.P. Decaux J.F. Girard J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 310-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expression of Cpt1a and Hmgcs2 were induced (3.5- and 2.5-fold, respectively) by 24 h fasting in mouse livers, apparently through insulin-Akt-FoxA2 pathway regulation (Fig. 1). Interestingly, roughly 40% of the induction was compromised by PCN treatment. Hence, to find PXR roles in the xenobiotics-dependent suppression of Cpt1a and Hmgcs2 genes in mouse liver, we compared the expressions of the genes between Pxr+/+ and Pxr–/– after PCN treatment in fasting condition (Fig. 2). Only in Pxr+/+ mice, PCN treatment repressed Cpt1a (35%) and Hmgcs2 (45%) mRNA expression significantly. In contrast, the same treatment increased mRNA for Scd1 (4-fold) in fasting Pxr+/+ mice (Fig. 2). The down-regulation of the Cpt1a and Hmgcs2 genes and the up-regulation of the Scd1 gene were not observed in the PCN-treated Pxr–/– mice, indicating these PCN-induced regulations were PXR-dependent. As expected, treatment with PCN induced Cyp3A11 mRNA >10-fold only in WT mice, providing the excellent control of the function of PXR and its activation by PCN in the animal model used (Fig. 2). Because these three genes are hormonally regulated, we measured serum insulin and glucagon and confirmed that PCN treatment did not change their levels (Table 1). Thus, these results clearly indicated that PXR directly down-regulated Cpt1a and Hmgcs2 genes and up-regulated the Scd1gene. We also examined the effect of PCN treatment on PPARα that regulates the Cpt1a and Hmgcs2 genes and found that PCN did not change the levels of PPARα mRNA in the Pxr+/+ and Pxr–/– mice (data not shown). Several genes involved in lipid metabolism (Cpt2, Srebp1, Fasn, Acc1, Mttp, and Dgat2) were analyzed (Table 2). None of these genes except Cpt2 and Srebp1, which are weakly down-regulated in PCN-treated Pxr+/+ mice and weakly up-regulated in Pxr–/– mice, respectively, has differential expression in the treatment groups.FIGURE 2PXR diversely regulates gene expressions of Cpt1a, Hmgcs2, and Scd1 in fasting mouse liver. Pxr+/+ (+/+) or Pxr–/– (–/–) mice were treated by intraperitoneal injection with PCN or vehicle (Me2SO (DMSO)). The mice were fasted for 24 h after the injection. Cpt1a, Hmgcs2, Scd1, and Cyp3a11 mRNA levels in these mice liver were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Relative mRNA quantity for each gene was expressed by taking those with Me2SO as one.

Open table in a new tab Unexpectedly, the serum levels of insulin were found to be 2-fold higher in the Pxr–/– mice compared with those in the Pxr+/+ mice (Table 1). This higher level of insulin might have caused the expressions of the Cpt1a and Hmgcs2 genes attenuated and of the Scd1 gene augmented in the non-treated Pxr–/– mice (Fig. 2). Whether the lack of PXR is directly responsible for this higher insulin levels remained unsolved, because it is still possible at the present time that the mouse with this phenotype happened to be selected during production of this line of Pxr–/– mice. Repression of the Trans-activation Activity of FoxA2—To explore molecular mechanism underlying the Cpt1a and Hmgcs2 regulation seen in Figs. 1 and 2, the functional interaction between mPXR and FoxA2 was analyzed in a transient reporter assay using Cpt1a and Hmgcs2 reporters. For the purpose, we cloned mouse Cpt1a gene promoters (–2.4 kb to +1 base) into a luciferase reporter plasmid and co-transfected the reporter with the expression plasmids for FoxA2 and mPXR into Huh7 cells (Fig. 3A). FoxA2 activated the Cpt1a reporters over 20-fold compared with control vector, and mPXR repressed this FoxA2-dependent trans-activation with >80% repression in the presence of PCN and RXR. In the absence of FoxA2 co-expressed, mPXR did not affect the activity of Cpt1a promoter. Thus, the results suggest that mPXR needs to be activated to repress the FoxA2 trans-activation. Next, we identified FoxA2 binding sites in the promoter of the genes. The results using serial deletion mutants of the reporter constructs suggested FoxA2 binding sites located between –2.1 and –1.6 kb in Cpt1a ge"
https://openalex.org/W1972890490,"'Hot Jupiters', extrasolar giant planets orbiting close to their parent stars, have transformed our view about what planets are and how they form. One in particular, HD 209458b, was found to have a huge escaping atmosphere that forms a comet-like tail. New Hubble Space Telescope observations of HD 209458b reveal a hot dense layer in its atmosphere where the temperature rises and atmospheric gas accelerates to escape the planet. This detection provides a new way to study the complex escape process of extrasolar planetary atmospheres. The atmospheres of extrasolar giant planets orbiting close to their parent stars are heated by the immense stellar irradiation. For the planet HD 209458b, this causes a sizable expansion of the atmosphere, and escape of neutral hydrogen gas. This paper reports the detection of absorption by hot hydrogen in the atmosphere of HD 209458b, probing a layer where the escaping gas forms in HD 209458b's upper atmosphere. About ten per cent of the known extrasolar planets are gas giants that orbit very close to their parent stars. The atmospheres of these ‘hot Jupiters’ are heated by the immense stellar irradiation1,2,3,4,5. In the case of the planet HD 209458b, this energy deposition results in a hydrodynamic state in the upper atmosphere, allowing for sizeable expansion and escape of neutral hydrogen gas2,3,4,5,6. HD 209458b was the first extrasolar planet discovered that transits in front of its parent star7. The size of the planet can be measured using the total optical obscuration of the stellar disk during an observed transit, and the structure and composition of the planetary atmosphere can be studied using additional planetary absorption signatures in the stellar spectrum. Here we report the detection of absorption by hot hydrogen in the atmosphere of HD 209458b. Previously, the lower atmosphere and the full extended upper atmosphere of HD 209458b have been observed2,6,8, whereas here we probe a layer where the escaping gas forms in the upper atmosphere of HD 209458b."

To provide a broad view of the bundle's protein complement, including those proteins participating in energy metabolism, we used shotgun mass spectrometry methods to identify proteins of purified chicken vestibular bundles. In addition to cytoskeletal proteins, proteins involved in Ca2+ regulation, and stress-response proteins, many of the most abundant bundle proteins that were identified by mass spectrometry were involved in ATP synthesis. After β-actin, the cytosolic brain isoform of creatine kinase was the next most abundant bundle protein; at ∼0.5 mM, creatine kinase is capable of maintaining high ATP levels despite 1 mM/s ATP consumption by the plasma-membrane Ca2+-ATPase. Consistent with this critical role in hair bundle function, the creatine kinase circuit is essential for high-sensitivity hearing as demonstrated by hearing loss in creatine kinase knockout mice.

Hair cell mechanotransduction is direct; displacement of the mechanically sensitive hair bundle leads to immediate gating of cation-selective transduction channels. Although metabolic energy apparently is not required for mechanotransduction itself, ATP is essential for myosins that carry out adaptation of the transduction current (Gillespie and Cyr, 2004Gillespie P.G.

Quantitatively, the most significant drain on ATP levels in the hair bundle is probably Ca2+ pumping by the plasma-membrane Ca2+-ATPase isoform 2 (PMCA2). Even with the low concentrations of Ca2+ that bathe the hair bundle, Ca2+ carries a substantial fraction of the transduction current (Lumpkin et al., 1997Lumpkin E.A. Marquis R.E. Hudspeth A.J.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6300-6318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which can occur at a rate of >1 mM/s (Ricci and Fettiplace, 1998Ricci A.J. Fettiplace R.

Plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase extrudes Ca2+ from hair cell stereocilia.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 610-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; see Supplemental Data). Hair bundles consist of dozens of stereocilia, typically 2–15 μm in length, each of which is packed with actin filaments. Stereocilia have no mitochondria and thus might rely on diffusion of ATP from mitochondria located at their bases. However, diffusion cannot deliver sufficient ATP to stereocilia tips to maintain Ca2+ pumping (see Discussion), suggesting that stereocilia use alternative methods for delivering ATP to PMCA2 and other ATPases. Understanding how hair bundles maintain energy homeostasis has been hampered by our limited knowledge of proteins present in the bundle. Although several methods for bundle isolation have been developed (Neugebauer and Thurm, 1984Neugebauer D.C. Thurm U.

High-purity isolation of bullfrog hair bundles and subcellular and topological localization of constituent proteins.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 625-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the scarcity of hair cells has prevented thorough cataloging of bundle proteins. Another approach, identification of “deafness genes,” has successfully discovered proteins which are essential for and specific to the inner ear (Petit, 2006Petit C. From deafness genes to hearing mechanisms: harmony and counterpoint.Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 57-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but this approach fails to identify proteins important for bundle function that play indispensable roles elsewhere. Recent technical advances have made mass spectrometry into a practical tool for identification and quantification of hair bundle proteins. Here we report the characterization of the proteins from hair bundles of the chicken utricle, a vestibular organ; we note that a large number of proteins consistently detected in the preparation are involved in energy metabolism. Not only are glycolytic enzymes abundant, but the cytosolic brain isoform of creatine kinase is present at high enough levels to be primarily responsible for ATP delivery to PMCA2 and other bundle ATPases. Consistent with that conclusion, mice lacking brain creatine kinase have vestibular dysfunction and reduced hearing sensitivity. We used a modification of the twist-off method (Gillespie and Hudspeth, 1991Gillespie P.G. Hudspeth A.J. High-purity isolation of bullfrog hair bundles and subcellular and topological localization of constituent proteins.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 625-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) to purify hair bundles from embryonic day 20 (E20) chicken utricles (Figure 1A); at this age, utricles have >20,000 hair cells (Goodyear et al., 1999Goodyear R.J. Gates R. Lukashkin A.N. Richardson G.P. Hair-cell numbers continue to increase in the utricular macula of the early posthatch chick.J. Neurocytol. 1999; 28: 851-861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the vestibular system is functional (Jones and Jones, 1996Jones S.M. Jones T.A. Short latency vestibular evoked potentials in the chicken embryo.J. Vestib. Res. 1996; 6: 71-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purity of the bundle preparation was assessed by immunolabeling isolated bundles with tubulin antibodies (to detect cell bodies), tropomyosin antibodies (to detect cuticular plates), MitoTracker (to detect mitochondria), and DAPI (to detect nuclei). Kinocilia were isolated along with most hair bundles and were well stained with anti-tubulin; by contrast, little additional tubulin staining was seen (Figure 1B; see also Figure 3A). Cuticular plates were rare; tropomyosin labeling was associated with about 1 in every 50 bundles (Figure 1C). No MitoTracker or DAPI staining was detected, suggesting the absence of mitochondrial or nuclear contamination (data not shown). Although these experiments indicated that there was minimal contamination of the bundle preparation, we cannot exclude that some individual preparations may have had contaminating cell bodies, and hence a few nuclei or mitochondria. Because the somatic volume exceeds the bundle volume by more than 20-fold, a small number of copurified cell bodies might skew the set of bundle proteins. Nevertheless, we are confident that our bundle isolations are sufficiently clean enough to achieve a high enrichment of bundle proteins. Indeed, the amount of PMCA2 immunoblot signal normalized to total protein increased 80-fold in bundles compared with whole utricles (data not shown), suggesting that substantial enrichment was achieved with the bundle isolation. As in frog hair bundles (Gillespie and Hudspeth, 1991Gillespie P.G. Hudspeth A.J. High-purity isolation of bullfrog hair bundles and subcellular and topological localization of constituent proteins.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 625-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), a protein that comigrated with actin (42 kDa) was the predominant protein in purified bundles (Figure 1D), accounting for 25%–50% of the protein in the bundles. Another 15 or so proteins appeared reproducibly as major bands in the preparation (Figure 1D). Although hair bundle proteins are scarce, mass spectrometry has sufficient sensitivity to detect many proteins of the bundle preparation. We used bundles from ∼100 chicken utricles (1–2 μg of total bundle protein) for each of five complementary shotgun mass spectrometry experiments (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data). In one approach, 1D PAGE protein separation-nanocapillary LC-MS/MS analysis (GeLC-MS/MS; Rezaul et al., 2005Rezaul K. Wu L. Mayya V. Hwang S.I. Han D. A systematic characterization of mitochondrial proteome from human T leukemia cells.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we separated purified bundle proteins using one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, cut gel slices with a robot, and separately digested the 35–45 slices with trypsin. Each sample was subsequently analyzed with reverse-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In other experiments, we directly digested agarose-embedded hair bundles with trypsin, then analyzed bundle peptides either directly with LC-MS/MS or the MuDPIT method (Washburn et al., 2001Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates III, J.R. Large-scale analysis of the yeast proteome by multidimensional protein identification technology.Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (3869) Google Scholar), which introduces a cation-exchange step prior to LC-MS/MS. Using the X! Tandem search algorithm accessed via the Global Protein Machine interface (Craig et al., 2004Craig R. Cortens J.P. Beavis R.C. Open source system for analyzing, validating, and storing protein identification data.J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 1234-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), we searched mass spectrometry data against the Ensembl database of predicted chicken proteins derived from the chicken genome sequencing project (International Chicken Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2004International Chicken Genome Sequencing ConsortiumSequence and comparative analysis of the chicken genome provide unique perspectives on vertebrate evolution.Nature. 2004; 432: 695-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). Because assignment algorithms do not absolutely identify proteins, confidence in protein identification depends on the search stringency. We used two measures that indicate the confidence of each identification. The log of the expectation value, log(e), indicates the probability that the identification occurred by chance (Fenyo and Beavis, 2003Fenyo D. Beavis R.C. A method for assessing the statistical significance of mass spectrometry-based protein identifications using general scoring schemes.Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar); the spectral count is the number of MS/MS spectra that were matched to the protein, and is approximately proportional to the abundance of the protein in the sample (Liu et al., 2004Liu H. Sadygov R.G. Yates III, J.R. A model for random sampling and estimation of relative protein abundance in shotgun proteomics.Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 4193-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar, Old et al., 2005Old W.M. Meyer-Arendt K. Aveline-Wolf L. Pierce K.G. Mendoza A. Sevinsky J.R. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G.

A total of 59 proteins were identified from the chicken hair bundle preparation using the following stringent selection criteria: log(e) score of <−20.0 in at least one experiment, spectral count of three or more in at least one experiment, and identification in a minimum of three of five mass spectrometry runs (Table 1). Although many other proteins were provisionally identified in our experiments (Table S1; Supplemental Data), the stringency of our selection conditions gives us confidence that the proteins in Table 1 were correctly identified.Table 1Chicken Utricle Hair Bundle ProteinsRank, IFRank, SCFIdentifier#Best log(e)Best countMW (kDa)IFSCFName11ENSGALP000000021015−573.925941.80.33730.2789Beta-actin

We used two methods for obtaining an estimate of the amount of each protein in the preparation. In the first, we summed the raw ion-current intensities of all matched peaks in MS/MS spectra for a given protein, summed the intensities for each data set, then determined the relative intensity contribution of each protein, which we assumed to be proportional to protein mass (Powell et al., 2004Powell D.W. Weaver C.M. Jennings J.L. McAfee K.J. He Y. Weil P.A. Link A.J. Cluster analysis of mass spectrometry data reveals a novel component of SAGA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7249-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Prochasson et al., 2005Prochasson P. Florens L. Swanson S.K. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L. The HIR corepressor complex binds to nucleosomes generating a distinct protein/DNA complex resistant to remodeling by SWI/SNF.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2534-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To compare approximate molar abundance, we normalized the data by dividing by molecular masses; we termed the resulting index an intensity factor (IF; Table 1). Because ion-current intensities vary depending both on mass spectrometer settings and on properties of each peptide, including recovery, capacity for ionization, and fragmentation properties (Ong and Mann, 2005Ong S.E. Mann M. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics turns quantitative.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar), this quantitation method will be more accurate for proteins identified with large numbers of independent peptides, which is the case for the majority of the proteins in Table 1. The ion-current intensity quantitation values were corroborated by quantitation using spectral counting, where the abundance of a protein in the original sample is considered to be proportional to the number of MS/MS spectra collected. Again, the ratio of spectral counts for a given protein relative to total spectral counts was adjusted for each protein molecular mass, yielding a spectral count factor (SCF; Table 1). Although quantitation with the two methods agreed well (Table 1; rank order correlation coefficient of 0.98), both measures should be considered to be only approximations of protein abundance. Our mass spectrometry results allowed us to identify what are likely the most abundant hair bundle proteins. As expected, cytoskeletal proteins dominated; the protein with the largest intensity and spectral-count factors was β-actin (Table 1). In addition, other cytoskeletal proteins known to be present in bundles (fimbrin, radixin, tubulin) were also prominent. On the basis of its apparent abundance and colocalization with radixin, we have argued that chloride intracellular “channel” 5 (CLIC5) is also a cytoskeletal protein (Gagnon et al., 2006Gagnon L.H. Longo-Guess C.M. Berryman M. Shin J.B. Saylor K.W. Yu H. Gillespie P.G. Johnson K.R. The chloride intracellular channel protein CLIC5 is expressed at high levels in hair cell stereocilia and is essential for normal inner ear function.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10188-10198Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Na+-H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1), a widely expressed scaffolding protein that also interacts with radixin (Shenolikar et al., 2004Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Cunningham R. Weinman E.J. Regulation of ion transport by the NHERF family of PDZ proteins.Physiology (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), was also present. Another cytoskeletal protein consistently detected was epithelial lost in neoplasm (EPLIN), which has been shown to crosslink actin filaments and prevent filament branching (Maul et al., 2003Maul R.S. Song Y. Amann K.J. Gerbin S.C. Pollard T.D. Chang D.D. EPLIN regulates actin dynamics by cross-linking and stabilizing filaments.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Finally, we detected two T-complex polypeptides, which are specialized chaperones for tubulin (Lopez-Fanarraga et al., 2001Lopez-Fanarraga M. Avila J. Guasch A. Coll M. Zabala J.C. Review: postchaperonin tubulin folding cofactors and their role in microtubule dynamics.J. Struct.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins involved in sequestration and removal of Ca2+ were also readily identified, including the mobile Ca2+ buffers parvalbumin 3 (Heller et al., 2002Heller S. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Choe Y. Hudspeth A.J. Parvalbumin 3 is an abundant Ca2+ buffer in hair cells.J. Assoc. Res.

At least one other transmembrane protein, PTPRQ (Goodyear et al., 2003Goodyear R.J. Legan P.K. Wright M.B. Marcotti W. Oganesian A. Coats S.A. Booth C.J. Kros C.J. Seifert R.A. Bowen-Pope D.F.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9208-9219PubMed Google Scholar), was detected, as were two peripheral membrane proteins, annexin A5 and phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein. Two mitochondrial membrane proteins, ATP synthase α subunit and voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 2, were detected, suggesting a small amount of mitochondrial contamination of the bundle preparation. Several proteins involved in stress responses were noted, including heat shock cognate 70 (Hsc70), which has been detected in hair cells previously (Neely et al., 1991Neely J.G. Thompson A.M. Gower D.J. Detection and localization of heat shock protein 70 in the normal guinea pig cochlea.Hear. Res. 1991; 52: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Several less-abundant proteins expressed from deafness genes (e.g., myosin-VIIIa, cadherin 23, espin, harmonin, and very large G protein-coupled receptor 1 [VLGR1]) were detected in one or more mass spectrometry runs, but did not meet the stringent criteria used for Table 1 (data not shown). More sensitive or exhaustive mass spectrometry experiments should permit more consistent detection of these scarce proteins. Finally, a striking result was the abundance of proteins involved in energy metabolism, including the cytosolic brain isoform of creatine kinase (creatine kinase B or B-CK; Figure 2A); the glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), enolase, and pyruvate kinase; and lactate dehydrogenase. By molar abundance, energy metabolism proteins account for ∼14% of the bundle, second only to cytoskeletal proteins (Figure 2B). Most proteins involved in glycolysis, particularly those necessary for ATP production, were reproducibly detected (Supplemental Data). Because some proteins identified in the hair bundle preparation might be from contaminating fractions, we used immunocytochemistry to validate many of the more significant identifications. Several proteins were clearly enriched in hair bundles, including CLIC5, radixin, GAPDH, NHERF, and PTPRQ (Figures 2C–2G). CLIC5, radixin, GAPDH, and PTPRQ each localized to the base of the hair bundle, although it is not clear that their patterns overlap precisely. By contrast, NHERF1 was distributed throughout the stereocilia. Others, like myosin-VI and parvalbumin 3 (Figures 2H–2I), were present both in bundles and somas; both were distributed in bundles relatively uniformly, although parvalbumin 3 apparently also concentrated in cuticular plates. Localization of these antigens in P4–P8 rat utricles was similar to that in chicken (data not shown). In a few cases, we identified proteins present in the bundle preparation that were clearly concentrated in other cellular locations, including TIM, which was located in the cuticular plate (Figure 2J), and ATP synthase, which was concentrated in the apical end of the hair cell soma (data not shown). Because both ion-current intensity and spectral counting quantitation methods indicated that B-CK was the next most abundant hair bundle protein after actin, we corroborated this result using quantitative immunoblotting. B-CK was readily detected in immunoblots of chicken utricle (Figure 3A) and bullfrog sacculus (data not shown) hair bundle proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2052250480,"Recent studies suggest that the lipid, ceramide, induces the default apoptosis process in eggs. Yet, it is obscure how newly formed embryos overcome this fate. Acid ceramidase (AC) is a key regulatory enzyme involved in ceramide metabolism, and mutations in the AC gene (Asah1) result in Farber Lipogranulomatosis, a fatal human genetic disorder. Our previous studies revealed that AC knockout (Asah1-/-) mice had a lethal phenotype, and herein we reveal the mechanism underlying this observation. A single-cell, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping method was developed to analyze individual embryos from Asah1 +/- intercrosses. Combined with Annexin V staining, this genotype analysis demonstrated that Asah1-/- embryos could not survive beyond the 2-cell stage, and underwent apoptotic death. Notably, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) treatment of early 2-cell embryos from the Asah1 +/- intercrosses rescued Asah1-/- embryos, and enabled their progression from the 2-cell to 4-8-cell stage. Quantitative PCR also revealed that expression of the Asah1 gene in healthy embryos was initiated at the 2-cell stage, coincident with embryonic genome activation (EGA). AC activity and Western blot analyses further demonstrated high expression and activity of the enzyme in normal, unfertilized eggs, which likely provide the protein to newly formed embryos prior to EGA. Based on these observations, we suggest that AC is an essential factor required for embryo survival that functions by removing ceramide from the newly formed embryos, thus inhibiting the default apoptosis pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2125378919,"A remarkable problem in neurobiology is how olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) select, from among a large odor receptor repertoire, which receptors to express. We use computational algorithms and mutational analysis to define positive and negative regulatory elements that are required for selection of odor receptor (Or) genes in the proper olfactory organ of Drosophila, and we identify an element that is essential for selection in one ORN class. Two odor receptors are coexpressed by virtue of the alternative splicing of a single gene, and we identify dicistronic mRNAs that each encode two receptors. Systematic analysis reveals no evidence for negative feedback regulation, but provides evidence that the choices made by neighboring ORNs of a sensillum are coordinated via the asymmetric segregation of regulatory factors from a common progenitor. We show that receptor gene choice in Drosophila also depends on a combinatorial code of transcription factors to generate the receptor-to-neuron map."
https://openalex.org/W1979672662,"The insulin signaling pathway has been implicated in several physiological and developmental processes. In mammals, it controls expression of 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl CoA Reductase (HMGCR), a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. In insects, which can not synthesize cholesterol de novo, the HMGCR is implicated in the biosynthesis of juvenile hormone (JH). However, the link between the insulin pathway and JH has not been established. In Drosophila, mutations in the insulin receptor (InR) decrease the rate of JH synthesis. It is also known that both the insulin pathway and JH play a role in the control of sexual dimorphism in locomotor activity. In studies here, to demonstrate that the insulin pathway and HMGCR are functionally linked in Drosophila, we first show that hmgcr mutation also disrupts the sexual dimorphism. Similarly to the InR, HMGCR is expressed in the corpus allatum (ca), which is the gland where JH biosynthesis occurs. Two p[hmgcr-GAL4] lines were therefore generated where RNAi was targeted specifically against the HMGCR or the InR in the ca. We found that RNAi-HMGCR blocked HMGCR expression, while the RNAi-InR blocked both InR and HMGCR expression. Each RNAi caused disruption of sexual dimorphism and produced dwarf flies at specific rearing temperatures. These results provide evidence: (i) that HMGCR expression is controlled by the InR and (ii) that InR and HMGCR specifically in the ca, are involved in the control of body size and sexual dimorphism of locomotor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2145983103,"Monkeypox virus, a zoonotic member of the genus Orthopoxviridae, can cause a severe, smallpox-like illness in humans. Monkeypox virus is thought to be endemic to forested areas of western and Central Africa. Considerably more is known about human monkeypox disease occurrence than about natural sylvatic cycles of this virus in non-human animal hosts. We use human monkeypox case data from Africa for 1970-2003 in an ecological niche modeling framework to construct predictive models of the ecological requirements and geographic distribution of monkeypox virus across West and Central Africa. Tests of internal predictive ability using different subsets of input data show the model to be highly robust and suggest that the distinct phylogenetic lineages of monkeypox in West Africa and Central Africa occupy similar ecological niches. High mean annual precipitation and low elevations were shown to be highly correlated with human monkeypox disease occurrence. The synthetic picture of the potential geographic distribution of human monkeypox in Africa resulting from this study should support ongoing epidemiologic and ecological studies, as well as help to guide public health intervention strategies to areas at highest risk for human monkeypox."
https://openalex.org/W2152834290,"We have previously shown that the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) activated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. In this study, we identified another viral protein, the spike of SARS-CoV, which played an important role in virus-stimulated COX-2 expression after screening all genes from the SARS-CoV genome. We found that an upstream calcium-dependent PKC isozyme PKC alpha that modulates the downstream ERK/NF-kappaB pathway through an influx of extracellular Ca2+ is induced by the spike protein of SARS-CoV. The ERK/NF-kappaB was identified to be involved in the activation of COX-2 promoter and production of COX-2 protein in HEK293T cells. We also demonstrated that another unusual pathway, the calcium-independent PI3K/PKC epsilon/JNK/CREB pathway, functioned in cooperation with the calcium-dependent pathway to induce COX-2 expression upon stimulation by spike protein. This pathway can be blocked by PKC epsilon-specific, small interfering RNA, PI3K/JNK kinase-specific inhibitors as well as dominant negative JNK. PKC epsilon-specific siRNA also attenuated the phosphorylation of JNK. Our results provide evidence that helps us understand the function of SRAS-CoV spike protein in SARS pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2050883145,"Many higher plants contain novel metabolites with antimicrobial, antifungal and antiviral properties. However, in the developed world almost all clinically used chemotherapeutics have been produced by in vitro chemical synthesis. Exceptions, like taxol and vincristine, were structurally complex metabolites that were difficult to synthesize in vitro. Many non-natural, synthetic drugs cause severe side effects that were not acceptable except as treatments of last resort for terminal diseases such as cancer. The metabolites discovered in medicinal plants may avoid the side effect of synthetic drugs, because they must accumulate within living cells. The aim here was to test an aqueous extract from the young developing leaves of willow (Salix safsaf, Salicaceae) trees for activity against human carcinoma cells in vivo and in vitro. In vivo Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma Cells (EACC) were injected into the intraperitoneal cavity of mice. The willow extract was fed via stomach tube. The (EACC) derived tumor growth was reduced by the willow extract and death was delayed (for 35 days). In vitro the willow extract could kill the majority (75%–80%) of abnormal cells among primary cells harvested from seven patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 13 with AML (acute myeloid leukemia). DNA fragmentation patterns within treated cells inferred targeted cell death by apoptosis had occurred. The metabolites within the willow extract may act as tumor inhibitors that promote apoptosis, cause DNA damage, and affect cell membranes and/or denature proteins."

The anti-Trx(Aβ15)4 antibody, in particular, recognized Aβ42 fibrils and oligomers but not monomers and exhibited the same kind of conformational selectivity against transthyretin, an amyloidogenic protein unrelated in sequence to Aβ. We have also demonstrated that anti-Trx(Aβ15)4, which binds to human AD plaques, markedly reduces Aβ pathology in transgenic AD mice.

This kind of recombinant antigen would be highly desirable because of its expected safety, ease of construction, and large scale production in a chemically homogeneous form.We have shown here that antibodies recognizing Aβ42 oligomers and fibrils (but not monomers) are produced by immunization with a 4-fold repeat of the Aβ15 peptide bearing an interposed three-amino-acid linker and arranged in tandem within the display site of bacterial thioredoxin (Trx). As revealed by comparison with Trx(Aβ15)n antigens bearing one or eight copies of Aβ15, conformational selectivity critically depends on Aβ15 multiplicity and on the use of multipeptide insertions fitting the structural constraining capacity of Trx. We have further documented the ability of the anti-Trx(Aβ15)4 antibody to bind Aβ aggregates in human brain and to ameliorate AD pathology in APP transgenic mice.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTrxAβ Constructs—Chimeric Trx polypeptides bearing the Aβ15 or the Aβ42 peptide (TrxAβ) were constructed by using a modified pET28 plasmid (Novagen), designated as pT7Kan-Trx, harboring the sequence for an N- and C-terminally His6-tagged version of bacterial thioredoxin along with a kanamycin resistance marker. The unique CpoI site present within the Trx coding sequence (nucleotide positions 99-105, corresponding to amino acid residues 34-35) was used as the cloning site. The phosphorylated oligonucleotides 5′-gtccgatggatgcagaattccgacatgactcaggatatgaagttcatcatcaaggcg-3′ (forward) and 5′-gaccgccttgatgatgaacttcatatcctgagtcatgtcggaattctgcatccatcg-3′ (reverse), both bearing 5′-protruding CpoI sequences (underlined), were annealed and ligated to CpoI-digested pT7Kan-Trx at a 1:10 vector:insert molar ratio. The resulting construct, pT7Kan-TrxAβ15, encodes a polypeptide, Trx-(1-33)gPMDAEFRHDSGYEVHHQGGpTrx (36-109) in which Aβ15 (underlined) is preceded by a Met residue at the N terminus and is followed by the Gly-Gly-Pro linker at the C terminus (with the Gly and Pro residues provided by the inserted ds-oligonucleotide and by the Trx scaffold, respectively). Constructs bearing multiple copies of Aβ15 were generated in a similar way but at a 1:100 vector:insert molar ratio using the sequence-verified insert excised from pT7-Kan-TrxAβ15 as starting material. Recombinant clones were screened by restriction analysis, and two of them, bearing four or eight copies of Aβ15, were selected. Essentially identical experimental conditions were used to construct TrxAβ42, which was cloned in both pT7Kan-Trx as well as in a companion vector (pT7Amp-Trx) carrying an ampicillin rather than a kanamycin antibiotic resistance marker.Expression and Purification of the TrxAβ Polypeptides—Expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to Escherichia coli BL21Star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen) transformed with each of the above constructs and allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37 °C. A different E. coli strain (Origami-DE3; Novagen) and modified expression conditions (pT7Amp-Trx vector; 5 h at 30 °C) were used for TrxAβ42, which was otherwise completely insoluble. Following cell lysis, His6-tagged TrxAβ polypeptides were bound to a metal affinity resin (Talon; Clontech), purified according to the manufacturer's instructions, and extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Protein concentration was determined with the Coomassie dye method (Bio-Rad) and by UV light absorbance. The composition and purity of individual polypeptide preparations was assessed by gel electrophoresis on 11% polyacrylamide-SDS gels.Immunization Protocols—TrxAβ polypeptides (2 mg/ml in PBS) were filter-sterilized, and an aliquot of each (10 nmol) was mixed with 1 mg of alum (Sigma-Aldrich) in a final volume of 400 μl immediately before use. Aβ42 (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in PBS (2 mg/ml) and aggregated overnight at 37 °C prior to immunization. Five randomly assorted groups of one-month-old male BALB/c mice (10 animals each) (Charles River Laboratories) were injected subcutaneously with the above antigens at days 1, 15, 30, and 60, as specified in the legend to Fig. 2A. The same treatment was applied to two negative control groups that were injected with PBS and with aggregated Aβ42, both without alum. Sera were collected two weeks after the last boost and randomly pooled in pairs. A standard immunization protocol (three doses of Trx(Aβ15)4 antigen in Freund adjuvant administered to one animal over a period of two months) was used to generate rabbit anti-Trx(Aβ15)4 antibodies (SeqLab).Detection of Anti-Aβ42 Antibodies—Total anti-Aβ42 antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at a fixed 1:200 dilution, using aggregated Aβ42 (0.5 μg/well) as the target antigen (43Spooner E.T. Desai R.V. Mori C. Leverone J.F. Lemere C.A. Vaccine. 2002; 21: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Following incubation, washing, and the addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulins (1/5000; Sigma-Aldrich) and the chromogenic substrate o-phenylendiamine (Sigma-Aldrich), plates were read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. Immunoglobulin isotype determination was conducted at a fixed 1:200 dilution using rat anti-mouse Ig subclass-specific, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (TechniPharm). ELISAs were conducted in triplicate on the five-paired sera from each group; only a subset of sera from the three top responders in Groups 3, 4, 6, and 7 (see Fig. 2A) was utilized for isotype determination. Comparisons between groups were conducted by one-way analysis of variance using Analyze-it software.Immunohistochemistry—Sera from mice immunized with each of the three Trx(Aβ15)n polypeptides were screened for their ability to bind Aβ plaques in human brain sections from a 68-year-old patient with neuropathological and clinical symptoms typical of severe AD. Various dilutions (1:100-1:1000) of pooled sera from the three top responders in Groups 5, 6, and 7 were analyzed. Sera were added to serial 8-μm brain sections of formalin-fixed, temporal cortical tissue, pretreated with formic acid (80%, 15 min). Sera from mock-treated animals (PBS; Group 1) and a commercial anti-Aβ40 polyclonal antibody (Anti-Pan β-Amyloid, BIOSOURCE) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Immunolabeling was revealed with the EnVision Plus/horseradish peroxidase system (Dako), using 3-3′-diaminobenzidine as the chromogenic substrate, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Images were captured with a digital camera at magnifications ranging from 50 to 400×.Immunodot Blot Assays and Atomic Force Microscopy Imaging—A stock solution of trifluoroacetic acid-pretreated, monomeric Aβ42 peptide (1 mm) was prepared as described previously (44Zagorski M.G. Yang J. Shao H. Ma K. Zeng H. Hong A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and diluted to the required Aβ42 final concentration (2-50 μm) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid prior to immunodot blot analysis. Aβ42 dissolved in 2 m dimethyl sulfoxide (1 mm final concentration) was utilized for the preparation of aggregated Aβ42 species (19Lambert M.P. Viola K.L. Chromy B.A. Chang L. Morgan T.E. Yu J.

A 10-fold dilution of the above stock solution into cold Ham's F-12 K medium (phenol red-free; BIOSOURCE) followed by incubation at 4 °C for 24 h was used to produce soluble oligomers; the same stock solution diluted into 10 mm HCl at a final concentration of 100 μm and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C was used to generate Aβ fibrils. Aβ oligomer and fibril formation, as well as the absence of fibrillar aggregates in soluble oligomer preparations, were verified by atomic force microscopy. To this end, samples of the above-described Aβ42 preparations were diluted 10-fold in 20 μl of deposition buffer (4 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgCl2) and immediately deposited onto freshly cleaved ruby mica at room temperature. After 5 min, mica disks were rinsed with milli-Q grade water and gently dried under a stream of nitrogen. Images were collected with a Nanoscope III microscope (Digital Instruments) operated in tapping mode using commercial diving board silicon cantilevers (MikroMasch). Oligomer formation was also checked by electrophoretic analysis on Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gels followed by silver staining as described in Ref. 19Lambert M.P. Viola K.L. Chromy B.A. Chang L.

Samples of recombinant Ile84 → Ser transthyretin (Ser84-TTR) enriched in soluble oligomers or higher order fibrillar aggregates were prepared by incubating the protein (2 mg/ml) for either 2 or 96 h at 37 °C in 100 mm sodium-acetate buffer (pH 4.0) as described in Refs. 46Lindgren M.

Acta. 1996; 1316: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar; control samples of monomeric Ser84-TTR were obtained from parallel incubations in 50 mm K-phosphate buffer (pH 7.6). For dot blot analysis, the various Aβ42 or Ser84-TTR species were hand-spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare) pre-wetted with TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.8% NaCl) (19Lambert M.P. Viola K.L. Chromy B.A. Chang L. Morgan T.E. Yu J. Venton D.L. Krafft G.A. Finch C.E. Klein W.L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Antisera for dot blot analysis were affinity-purified on protein-A minicolumns (Diatheva) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following the determination of total immunoglobulin concentration with the Coomassie dye method, purified immunoglobulins were used for dot blot assays at a final concentration of 0.75 μg/ml. After blocking at room temperature with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), the blots were incubated for 1.5 h with each of the three anti-Trx(Aβ15)n antibodies in dry milk-TBST, washed 3 × 10 min with TBST, followed by mouse immunoglobulin detection with the SuperSignal West Femto kit (Pierce), as specified by the manufacturer. To distinguish between monomer and oligomer binding, affinity-purified anti-monomeric TrxAβ15 antibodies (0.75 μg/ml) were preincubated (2 h at 4 °C under stirring conditions) with a 50-fold molar excess of the monomeric Aβ42 peptide in TBS prior to hybridization. At least two replicates were carried out for each of the 15 pools of antisera from the various Trx(Aβ15)n-treated groups (see Fig. 2A, Groups 5-7). Dot blot images were quantified with the Quantity One program (Bio-Rad). Signal volume intensities for individual Aβ42 species within each membrane were averaged, and the resulting data were plotted with Sigma Plot (SPSS).Surgery and Neuropathological Evaluation of Transgenic AD Mice—Female transgenic AD (Tg2576) mice expressing the Swedish mutation of human APP (48Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3655) Google Scholar) were obtained from the Boston University Alzheimer Disease Center mouse colony. Founders for this colony were provided by Dr. Karen Hsiao-Ashe (Department of Neurology, University of Minnesota Medical School). The APP Tg2576 mice developed behavioral abnormalities and exhibited histological evidence of brain Aβ deposits as plaques along with associated astrogliosis from as early as 8 months. Mice were genotyped using a standardized PCR assay on tail DNA and were housed four in each cage under standard conditions with ad libitum access to food and water. Six 14-month-old APP mice (32-34 g each), placed on a 12-h light schedule, were used for surgeries. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine HCl/xylazine intraperitoneal injection (100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine; 100 μl/10 g body weight) and were positioned in a stereotaxic apparatus (Koph) with a mouse head adaptor. Thermoregulation was maintained at 37 °C using a warming pad with respiratory monitoring throughout the procedure. The scalp was incised in the midline to expose the sagittal suture, and stereotaxic coordinates in both hemispheres were determined (49Franklin K.B.J. Paxinos G. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997Google Scholar). The bregma was used as a reference point (-2.0 mm), and holes were drilled in the calvarium at the junction of the left and right lateral coordinates (1.75 mm). Affinity-purified anti-Trx(Aβ15)4 antibodies along with mock immunoglobulins from PBS-treated mice (2 μl each) were stereotaxically injected into the left and right hippocampi (-2.0 mm ventral), respectively, using a blunt-tipped 10-μl syringe (Hamilton). Upon syringe placement, there was a 2-min dwell time followed by a 4-min injection time and an additional 2-min dwell time prior to removal of the syringe. A topical antiseptic was applied as the incision was closed using a 9-mm autoclip. Mice were kept on a warming pad until full recovery. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and both the Department of Veterans Affairs and Boston University Animal Care committees. Seven days post-injection, the mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 2% buffered paraformaldehyde (100 ml). Brains were post-fixed for 2 h, cryoprotected in a graded series of glycerol, and subsequently frozen-sectioned (50 μm). Serially cut mouse tissue sections were stained for Nissl substance, immunostained with anti-Aβ42 (catalog number 344; BIOSOURCE International), anti-Aβ oligomer (A11; BIOSOURCE International), and glial fibrillary antigen protein (Dako) antibodies and silver-stained using the Campbell-Switzer method for identification of mature Aβ plaques. Immunostained coronal tissue sections, serially cut within the hippocampus beginning from interaural (1.68 mm)/bregma (-2.12 mm) to interaural (2.16 mm)/bregma (-1.64 mm), were analyzed. Aβ-positive plaques were quantified from high resolution images of the same brain areas within the anti-Trx(Aβ15)4-treated hemisphere and the contralateral mock-"
https://openalex.org/W2101205453,"Toll-like receptors (TLR) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and play important roles in the innate immune system. While single-stranded viral RNA is the natural ligand of TLR7/TLR8, the imidazoquinoline resiquimod (R-848) is recognized as a potent synthetic agonist of TLR7/TLR8. We investigated the effects of TLR7/8 activation on lipid mediator production in polymorphonuclear leukocytes exposed to R-848. Although R-848 had minimal effects by itself, it strongly enhanced leukotriene B4 formation on subsequent stimulation by fMLP, platelet-activating factor, and the ionophore A23187. R-848 acted via TLR8 but not TLR7 as shown by the lack of effect of the TLR7-specific ligand imiquimod. Priming with R-848 also resulted in enhanced arachidonic acid release and platelet-activating factor formation following fMLP stimulation, as well as enhanced prostaglandin E2 synthesis following the addition of arachidonic acid. Western blot analysis demonstrated that R-848 induced the phosphorylation of the cytosolic phospholipase A2alpha, promoted 5-lipoxygenase translocation and potently stimulated the expression of the type 2 cyclooxygenase. Bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of endosomal acidification, efficiently inhibited all R-848-induced effects. These studies demonstrate that TLR8 signaling strongly promotes inflammatory lipid mediator biosynthesis and provide novel insights on innate immune response to viral infections."
https://openalex.org/W2156504947,"Prolonged exposure to hyperoxia results in hyperoxic acute lung injury (HALI). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to have cytoprotective effects and prolong survival in an in vivo model of HALI. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has protective effects in hyperoxia; therefore, we hypothesized that induction of HO-1 would be an important contributor to VEGF-induced cytoprotection. Using inducible, lung-specific VEGF overexpressing transgenic mice, we demonstrated that VEGF is a potent inducer of HO-1 mRNA and protein in mouse lung. To evaluate the effect of inhibition of HO-1 on injury, VEGF transgenic mice were treated with HO-1 short interfering RNA (HO-1 siRNA) and exposed to hyperoxia. Total lung lavage protein concentration, TUNEL staining, lipid peroxidation, and wet-to-dry ratio were all increased, consistent with increased injury. These findings were corroborated by survival studies in which inhibition of HO-1 function using tin-protoporphryin or silencing of HO-1 with lentiviral HO-1 short hairpin RNA (ShRNA) significantly decreased survival in hyperoxia. We conclude from these data that VEGF-induced HO-1 is an important contributor to cytoprotection in this in vivo model of acute lung injury and that alterations in VEGF function in the lung are likely to be important determinants of the outcome of acute lung injury."
https://openalex.org/W2028897456,"Mechanics and surface microtopology of the molecular carrier influence cell adhesion, but the mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. We used a micropipette adhesion frequency assay to quantify how the carrier stiffness and microtopology affected two-dimensional kinetics of interacting adhesion molecules on two apposing surfaces. Interactions of P-selectin with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) were used to demonstrate such effects by presenting the molecules on three carrier systems: human red blood cells (RBCs), human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells, and polystyrene beads. Stiffening the carrier alone or in cooperation with roughing the surface lowered the two-dimensional affinity of interacting molecules by reducing the forward rate but not the reverse rate, whereas softening the carrier and roughing the surface had opposing effects in affecting two-dimensional kinetics. In contrast, the soluble antibody bound with similar three-dimensional affinity to surface-anchored P-selectin or PSGL-1 constructs regardless of carrier stiffness and microtopology. These results demonstrate that the carrier stiffness and microtopology of a receptor influences its rate of encountering and binding a surface ligand but does not subsequently affect the stability of binding. This provides new insights into understanding the rolling and tethering mechanism of leukocytes onto endothelium in both physiological and pathological processes.

This provides new insights into understanding the rolling and tethering mechanism of leukocytes onto endothelium in both physiological and pathological processes. Selectins are important adhesive molecules that mediate the cell adhesions in such biological processes as platelet thrombosis, inflammatory responses, as well as tumor metastasis (1Hynes R.O.

For example, selectin-ligand interactions mediate the rolling and tethering of leukocytes onto endothelium in blood flow.

As a biochemically well-characterized selectin ligand, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) consists of homodimer cross-linked by disulfate bonds and binds to selectins through its N-terminal sulfoglycopeptide, which includes three tyrosine sulfates and the core-2 O-glycan (5Moore K.L.

This is different from three-dimensional binding, where at least one of the receptors and ligands is in the fluid phase. Not only is two-dimensional kinetics of receptor-ligand binding determined by their intrinsic structures, but it also depends on their surface presentation as well as the stiffness and microtopology of molecule-bearing carrier. On the one hand, randomizing the selectin construct or rabbit immunoglobulin G (rIgG) or lowering the length of selectin extending outward from the cell surface significantly reduces the two-dimensional forward rate, but not reverse rate, of selectin-ligand or CD16-rIgG interactions (9Huang J.

HL-60 cells adhere to immobilized full-length E-selectin, which contains all six CRs, but not to shorter E-selectin constructs with two or less CRs. However, they bind to the short E-selectin constructs with two or less CRs when they are captured by a nonblocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) adsorbed on the plastic surface (6Li S.H. Burns D.K.

On the other hand, the stiffness and microtopology of the molecule-bearing carrier onto which receptors and ligands are anchored influence cell adhesion mediated by receptor-ligand binding. For example, CD16b molecules coupled onto relatively smoother human red blood cells (RBCs) bind to their human IgG ligand with a ∼50-fold increase in two-dimensional effective affinity over those transfected onto relatively rougher Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells or human erythroleukemia K562 cells (10Williams T.E.

Compared with intact neutrophils with the soft and rough configuration and fixed neutrophils with the relatively stiff and rough configuration, stiff and smooth PSGL-1-bearing microbeads roll faster and dissociate briefly over P-selectin-immobilized substrate (11Park E.Y.H.

Cytochalasin B treatment or hypotonic swelling of neutrophils disrupts the tethering to and enhances the rolling on E- or P-selectin-immobilized substrate in shear flow, probably because of a likely increase in the area of cell-substrate contact (12Finger E.B. Bruehl R.E. Bainton D.F. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5085-5096PubMed Google Scholar). Extensible microvilli, in contrast to rigid and non-extensible microvilli, reduced the pulling forces imposed on L-selectin-PSGL-1 bonds and facilitate the tether formation and rolling on endothelium (13Shao J.Y. Ting-Beall H.P. Hochmuth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6797-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, the effects of carrier stiffness and microtopology on two-dimensional binding have not been quantified systematically.To test this possibility, three molecule-bearing carriers: RBCs with deformable membrane and relatively smooth surfaces, human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells with less deformable membrane and rough surfaces, and polystyrene beads with stiff and smooth surfaces, were used in the current work. P-selectin and PSGL-1 were, respectively, coated or expressed onto the carrier surface with distinct stiffness and microtopology, and the effect on two-dimensional kinetics of P-selectin-PSGL-1 binding was investigated. Our results indicated that the carrier stiffness and microtopology influence the two-dimensional forward rate but not the reverse rate of the molecule of interest, whereas they have no effect on three-dimensional affinity. These results provide insights into the biophysical mechanisms by which the carrier stiffness and microtopology affect cell adhesion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells, Beads, and Proteins—Human RBCs were isolated from whole blood of normal healthy volunteers as previously described (14Williams T.E.

Briefly, ∼5 ml of whole blood was collected by venipuncture into sterile tubes containing EDTA. This was centrifuged (30 min, 700 × g, room temperature), and the supernatant was removed.

Human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells from ATCC were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. HL-60 cells constitutively express PSGL-1 ligands for P- and E-selectin.

Anti-CD58 mAb TS2/9 (mIgG1) was a generous gift from Dr. Periasamy Selvaraj (Emory University School of Medicine) (19Nagarajan S. Chesla S.E. Cobern L. Anderson P. Zhu C. Selvaraj P. J. Biol.

Immunol. Methods. 1977; 16: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The coupling efficiency of proteins was examined by flow cytometry, using CD58, which is constitutively expressed on RBCs at a known density as a standard (21Selvaraj P. Plunkett M.L. Dustin M. Sanders M.E. Shaw S. Springer T.A. Nature. 1987; 326: 400-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The capturing mAb-coated RBCs were first incubated with 50–200 ng/ml of respective P-selectin and PSGL-1 constructs for 30 min at room temperature before being used in micropipette aspiration measurements, whereas mIgG1-coated RBCs were incubated with the same proteins and used as a control.To form a biological force probe, the biotinylated capturing mAbs (S12 or PL2) were coupled onto the surface of a streptavidin-coated polystyrene bead, and the bead was then linked to a biotinylated human RBC (cf. Fig. 2, d′ and e′). A biotinylation method described previously (22Gretch D.R. Suter M. Stinski M.F. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) was modified to biotinylate the capturing mAbs and RBCs. Briefly, NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) was dissolved into dimethyl formamide to a final concentration 5 ∼ 10 mm. 3–5 μl of NHS-LC-Biotin solution in dimethyl formamide were added into 300 μl of capturing mAb solution in a concentration of 50 μg/ml or 190 μl of RBC suspension in a concentration of ∼107/ml. After 30 min of incubation, the capturing mAb solution was eluted via a D-Salt Dextran Desalting Column (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline to exclude the unbound NHS-LC-Biotin, and the biotinylating efficiency was confirmed using an ImmunuPure® HABA kit (Pierce). Biotinylated RBCs were directly washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and then stored in EAS45+ in ∼107/ml. The biotinylated capturing mAbs and RBCs can be stored for several months and one or two weeks, respectively. Next, 5 μl of biotinylated capturing mAbs (S12 or PL2) at 30 μg/ml were mixed with 300 μl of streptavidin-coated beads in ∼107/ml for 30 min at room temperature. After washing three times in phosphate-buffered saline, collected beads were segregated into two sets: one set of ∼104 beads was resuspended and incubated with soluble sPs or PSGL-1 proteins at the final concentration of 350 ng/ml; after washing once in PBS, the collected beads were ready for micropipette aspiration measurements. Another set was used to determine the site densities of the molecules of interest (see below).Site Density Determination—Site densities of surface proteins coated on RBCs or beads or expressed on HL-60 cells were determined using flow cytometry and/or immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) (23Long M. Chen J. Jiang N. Selvaraj P. McEver R.P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 352-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To measure densities of G1- or PL1-coated via CrCl3 coupling, RBCs were incubated directly with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (4.7 equivalent of FITC per IgG) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in 200 μl of FACS buffer (RPMI, 5 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% sodium azide) on ice for 40 min. To measure the PSGL-1 expression, HL-60 cells were incubated first with anti-PSGL-1 mAb PL1 and then with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (4.4 equivalent of FITC per IgG). After washing, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1a, inset). Site densities were then calculated by comparing the fluorescence intensities of the cells with those of standard beads (Bangslabs) (9Huang J. Chen J. Chesla S.E. Yago T. Mehta P. McEver R.P. Zhu C.

To measure densities of P-selectin or PSGL-1 coupled by capturing mAb-coated RBCs or beads, one set of RBCs or beads precoated with a range of densities of the relevant capturing mAb (three or four densities for each protein) were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, and the fluorescence intensities were measured using flow cytometry as above. Another set of RBCs or beads precoated with the same range of densities of capturing mAb were incubated with the corresponding P-selectin or PSGL-1, and their site densities were measured by IRMA (9Huang J.

A calibration curve was obtained for each protein by plotting the protein site density against the mean fluorescence intensity of the capturing mAb (Fig. 1b), thereby allowing calculation of the site densities of protein of interest from the mean fluorescence intensities of the capturing mAb.FIGURE 1Site density determination. a, flow cytometry was used to determine site density of PSGL-1 constitutively expressed on HL-60 cells and G1- and PL1-coated RBCs. The calibration curve of standard beads was plotted as molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochromes (MESF) against fluorescence intensity of beads measured by cytometry (inset, filled histograms labeled Beads) using the manufacturer-provided program. Fluorescence intensity of PSGL-1 was measured from the cytometry (inset, unfilled histogram labeled PSGL-1), and the site density was estimated from calibration curves of standard beads after subtracting the negative control (inset, open histogram labeled NC). b, combined immunoradiometric and flow cytometry assays were employed to determine site densities of P-selectin or PSGL-1 captured by capturing mAbs (S12 or PL2) precoated on RBCs or beads. The calibration curve was plotted as site density of P-selectin or PSGL-1, determined using an immunoradiometric assay, against fluorescence intensity of the capturing mAbs (S12 or PL2), measured using the flow cytometry assay.

Five systems were used to quantify the effect of carrier stiffness and microtopology: a P-selectin-coated RBC interacting with a PSGL-1-coated RBC (RBC-RBC) (Fig. 2, a and a′), a P-selectin-coated RBC interacting with a PSGL-1-expressing HL-60 cell (RBC-HL-60) (Fig. 2, b and b′) (9Huang J.

Briefly, molecular carriers were distributed in a hypo-osmotic solution at an osmolarity of 175 mOsm (H2O:HBSS = 1:1.4) to swell the RBC (some experiments were done at 200 and 150 mOsm). Two molecular carriers were, respectively, aspirated by two micropipettes at a suction pressure of 4 mm H2O (some measurements were done at 8 and 12 mm H2O) and were staged by placing them onto controlled contact via micromanipulation. The adhesion at the end of a given contact period was observed microscopically from the deflection of the flexible RBC membrane upon retracting it away from the RBC or HL-60 cell or the bead. Such a contact-retraction cycle was repeated a hundred times per pair to estimate the adhesion probability, Pa, at that contact duration, t. For each case examined, ∼40 pairs of cells or beads were used to obtain several Pa versus t curves that correspond to different receptor and ligand densities, mr and ml. Each binding curve was fitted to a small system probabilistic kinetic model (9Huang J. Chen J. Chesla S.E. Yago T. Mehta P. McEver R.P. Zhu C. Long M. J. Biol.

Multiple pairs of (kr0,mlAcKa0) or (kr0,AcKa0) values were obtained for each stiffness and microtopology to allow evaluation of the mean and standard deviation. The statistical significance (or the lack thereof) of the difference between the two-dimensional affinities (or reverse rates) of the P-selectin-PSGL-1 pair presented with different carrier stiffness and microtopology was assessed using the Student's t test.In one set of experiments, adhesion frequencies between RBCs coated with G1 via CrCl3 coupling and P-selectin-coated RBCs or beads or between RBCs coated with PL1 via CrCl3 coupling and PSGL-1-expressing HL-60 cells or PSGL-1-coated beads were measured at a single contact time of 4 s, and the results were expressed as y = -ln(1 - Pa)/(mr × ml). 5–6 pairs of cells were measured for each case, and the statistical significance of the differences between the results from different conditions were assessed by the Student's t test.Scatchard Analysis—Scatchard analysis was used to determine three-dimensional binding affinities of 125I-labeled G1 or PL1 mAb in the fluid phase for either sPs or PSGL-1 constructs coated on RBC or bead surfaces by precoated capturing mAbs (S12 or PL2) or expressed on HL-60 cells (9Huang J.

Briefly, 200 μl of 0.1–6 μg/ml 125I-G1 or 125I-PL1 was added to ∼5 × 106 cells or beads. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, 500 μl of a 2:8 ratio of GS-1 sealing oil (Sifang Oil Inc., Beijing): dibutyl phthalate (Sigma) oil mixture was added into each sample, which was then centrifuged to separate the free 125I-G1 or 125I-PL1 from the cells or beads. Radioactivity associated with the cell pellets or packed beads was measured using a γ-counter. Specific binding of G1 or PL1 mAb was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding. All assays were performed in triplicate. The statistical significance of the difference between three-dimensional affinities of the G1-P-selectin and the PL1-PSGL-1 pair presented with different carrier stiffness and microtopology was assessed using the Student's t test.RESULTSBinding Is Specifically Mediated—The adhesion frequency at sufficiently long contact time (t → ∞) was used to quantify the binding in control experiments. As exemplified for P-selectin-PSGL-1 binding in the RBC-RBC configuration (Figs. 2a, 2a′, and 3a), adhesion frequencies measured using the micropipette assay were mediated by specific P-selectin-PSGL-1 interactions, because they were present when the RBCs were coated with S12 and PL1 mAbs to capture P-selectin and PSGL-1 constructs, respectively, but were abolished when P-selectin or PSGL-1 constructs were absent. In addition, binding was blocked by mAbs against PSGL-1 (PL1), P-selectin (G1), and by the calcium chelator EDTA (Fig. 3a). Binding specificity for the other four configurations of RBC-HL-60 (Fig. 2, b and b′ and Ref. 9Huang J. Chen J. Chesla S.E. Yago T. Mehta P. McEver R.P. Zhu C. Long M. J. Biol.

A carrier (RBC or bead) coated by sPs captured via S12 bound specifically to another carrier (RBC or bead) coated by PSGL-1 captured via PL2 or an HL-60 cell expressing PSGL-1. The adhesion was abolished when PSGL-1 or sPs was absent or when anti-PSGL-1 mAb PL1 or anti-P-selectin mAb G1 or EDTA was present. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. of probability at t → ∞. The symbols (+) and (-) represent the presence and absence of that protein or reagent, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding Follows Simple Kinetics—Contact duration dependence of adhesion frequency was measured using the micropipette assay at contact times ranging from 0.25–7 s in four configurations of RBC-RBC (Fig. 4a), RBC-Bead (Fig. 4b), Bead-HL-60 (Fig. 4c), and Bead-Bead (Fig. 4d). Site densities used were systematically varied by varying the amount of coated capturing mAb (S12 or PL2), as summarized in the inset in Fig. 4d. The adhesion probability, Pa, was obtained by removing the nonspecific adhesion frequency, Pn (dashed lines in Fig. 4, a–d, obtained by fitting the directly measured nonspecific adhesion frequency to Eq. 1), from the directly measured total adhesion frequency, Pt, according to Pa = (Pt - Pn)/(1 - Pn). Similar to those described previously for RBC-HL-60 configuration (9Huang J. Chen J. Chesla S.E. Yago T. Mehta P. McEver R.P. Zhu C. Long M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44915-44923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the data (points in Fig. 4, a–d) exhibited with a transient phase where Pa increased with t and a steady phase where Pa reached equilibrium. For each configuration of distinct stiffness and microtopology, Eq. 1 was used to best fit each binding curve to obtain two kinetic parameters of kr0 and AcKa0. The mean reverse rate and effective binding affinity were calculated from two pairs of kr0 and AcKa0 values at two densities of receptors. The mean kr0 and AcKa0 values were then used, along with the corresponding mr and ml values measured from independent experiments, to predict each Pa versus t curve (solid lines in Fig. 4, a–d). It is evident that the model fits the data well.FIGURE 4Binding curves. Adhesion probability was plotted against contact duration at different site densities, summarized in the inset in panel d, of ml × mr = 4.9 × 10.2 and 4.9 × 3.7 μm-4 for RBC-RBC (a), ml × mr = 19.9 × 7.9, and 19.9 × 3.5 μm-4 for RBC-Bead (b), ml × mr = 67.6 × 53.4, a"

We analyzed mRNA expression in brains of prenatally choline-deficient, choline-supplemented, or control rats of various ages [postnatal days (P) 1 to 34 for hippocampus and E16 to P34 for cortex] using oligonucleotide microarrays and found alterations in gene expression levels evoked by prenatal choline intake that were, in most cases, transient occurring during the P15-P34 period. We selected a subset of genes, encoding signaling proteins, and verified the microarray data by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses. Prenatally choline-supplemented rats had the highest expression of calcium/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) I and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) II (Igf2) in the cortex and of the transcription factor Zif268/EGR1 in the cortex and hippocampus. Prenatally choline deficient rats had the highest expression of CaMKIIbeta, protein kinase Cbeta2, and GABA(B) receptor 1 isoforms c and d in the hippocampus. Similar changes in the expression of the proteins encoded by these genes were observed using immunoblot analyses. These data show that the prenatal supply of choline causes multiple modifications in the developmental patterns of expression of genes known to influence learning and memory and provide molecular correlates for the cognitive changes evoked by altered availability of choline in utero."
https://openalex.org/W2017019062,"Endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) is a potent vasodilator in the cardiovascular system. Several lines of experimental evidence suggest that NO or NO equivalents may also be generated in the blood. However, blood contains a large amount of hemoglobin (Hb) in red blood cells (RBCs). The RBC-encapsulated Hb can react very quickly with NO, which is only limited by the rate of NO diffusion into the RBCs. It is unclear what the possible NO concentration levels in blood are and how the NO diffusion coefficient (D) and the permeability (Pm) of RBC membrane to NO affect the level of NO concentration. In this study, a steady-state concentration experimental method combined with a spherical diffusion model are presented for determining D and Pm and examining the effect of NO generation rate (V0) and hematocrit (Hct) on NO concentration. It was determined that Pm is 4.5 ± 1.5 cm/s and D is 3410 ± 50 μm2/s at 37 °C. Simulations based on experimental parameters show that, when the rate of NO formation is as high as 100 nm/s, the maximal NO concentration in blood is below 0.012 nm at Pm = 4.5 cm/s and Hct = 45%. Thus, it is unlikely that NO is directly exported or generated from the RBC as an intravascular signaling molecule, because its concentration would be too low to exert a physiological role. Furthermore, our results suggest that, if RBCs export NO bioactivity, this would be through NO-derived species that can release or form NO rather than NO itself.

Endothelium-derived NO is a potent vasodilator and plays an important role in maintaining vascular tone. As a small diatomic molecule similar to O2, NO is highly diffusible. After NO is generated within the endothelium of blood vessels, it diffuses to both sides of the endothelial cell layer, the lumen and the vessel wall. The blood carries a large amount of hemoglobin (Hb) 2The abbreviations used are: Hb, hemoglobin; RBC, red blood cell; Hct, hematocrit. within red blood cells (RBCs) flowing in the vessel lumen, and the rate of NO reaction with Hb is very rapid. Theoretical analysis shows that the high amount of Hb in the blood can greatly lower the NO concentration at the endothelial layer, which may finally result in a very low NO concentration in the vessel wall (1Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8137-8141Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). This raises a question about how NO can escape from being trapped by the high amount of Hb in the blood. This question has been extensively studied in recent years. Using a NO electrode, we demonstrated previously (2Liu X. Miller M.J. Joshi M.S. Sadowska-Krowicka H. Clark D.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. J. Biol.

This relatively slower NO consumption rate was also observed by Liao and co-workers (3Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol.

It has been generally accepted that the relatively slower NO consumption rate by RBCs is caused by the resistance to NO diffusion from the solution into RBCs, but there is debate on whether the RBC membrane or the extracellular unstirred solution layer is the main source of resistance (2Liu X.

Kuo L. Liao J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1705-H1714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Butler A.R. Megson I.L. Wright P.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1425: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These theoretical and experimental results show that, although the large amount of Hb in the blood is a sink of the endothelium-derived NO, the diffusion resistance from the endothelial surface to the inside of the RBCs forms a physical barrier to prevent NO from being rapidly consumed by the RBC-encapsulated Hb. Two other mechanisms for protecting NO bioactivity were also proposed (10Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar, 11Pawloski J.R. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 12Gladwin M.T.

One mechanism assumes that RBCs import NO and store it as SNO-Hb (S-nitrosylated-Hb), which is formed preferentially in the oxygenated (or R) structure and associated predominantly with the RBC membrane. The NO group from SNO-Hb can be transferred to cysteine thiols of the band 3 protein at the RBC membrane by deoxygenation, and then a NO congener or NOx is exported from RBCs to dilate blood vessels (11Pawloski J.R. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The other mechanism assumes that the relatively stable nitrite is a source of NO in the blood and tissues, which is converted to the bioactive NO or NO equivalents during physiological hypoxia to dilate blood vessels (12Gladwin M.T. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, it is uncertain whether the RBC-exported or -generated NO bioactivity is the diatomic molecule NO or other NO congeners/equivalents. In this study, an experimental method combined with a mathematical model was developed for determining the RBC membrane permeability (Pm) and NO diffusion coefficient (D). Computer simulations based on experimental data were performed to predict the possible NO concentration in blood at different generation rates. Preparation of NO Solutions—NO stock solution was prepared as described in previous papers (14Thomas D.D. Liu X. Kantrow S.P. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 15Liu X. Liu Q. Gupta E. Zorko N. Brownlee E. Zweier J.L. Nitric Oxide. 2005; 13: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, NO was scrubbed of higher nitrogen oxides by passage first through a U-tube containing NaOH pellets and then through a1 m de-aerated (bubbled with 100% argon) KOH solution in a custom-designed apparatus using only glass or stainless steel tubing and fittings. To prepare the saturated NO solution, the purified NO gas was bubbled for 15 min into the de-aerated buffer (0.2 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4), which was contained in a glass sampling flask with a septum purchased from Kimble/Kontes (Vineland, NJ). The saturated NO concentration was nearly 2 mm. Preparation of Red Blood Cells—Blood was drawn from Sprague-Dawley rats into a heparinized tube and centrifuged at 2300 × g for 10 min. The plasma and buffy coat were discarded, and the RBC pellet was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (15 mm phosphate (potassium) plus 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4). The packed RBCs were then resuspended in the same buffer and stored on ice for use. Electrochemical Measurements of NO Concentration—The electrochemical system for measuring NO included a Clark-type NO electrode (ISO-NOP from World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), a 4-port water-jacketed electrochemical chamber (NOCHM-4 from WPI), a Haake DC10-P5/U circulating bath, a magnetic stirrer, and an Apollo 4000 free radical analyzer (WPI). NO electrodes were inserted (through the three side ports) into the water-jacketed chamber containing 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline for NO measurements in the presence or absence of RBCs. The solution was rapidly stirred at a constant speed with a magnetic bar stirrer. The temperature of the chamber was held at 37 °C by the circulating bath. NO was added into the solution (through a hole on the cap of the chamber) with a Hamilton syringe by a bolus injection to calibrate NO electrodes or by a SP310i-Plus syringe pump (WPI, Sarasota, Florida) at a given rate (volume/min) to reach a steady-state concentration in the presence of RBCs. In each experimental measurement, the total volume of NO solution injected into the chamber by the syringe pump was <1.5% of the volume of the solution in the chamber. Mathematical Model Describing the Steady-state NO Concentration Distribution in Solutions Containing RBCs—It was previously demonstrated that the rate of NO consumption by RBCs is nearly constant until all Hb in RBCs is consumed by NO (2Liu X. Miller M.J. Joshi M.S. Sadowska-Krowicka H. Clark D.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18709-18713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Thus, it can be predicted that the steady-state NO concentration can be reached when the rate of NO supply is equal to the rate of NO consumption by RBCs. The mathematical model below was developed for determining how the steady-state NO concentration changes with Pm, hematocrit (Hct), and NO generation rate. We assumed that a spherical RBC with radius r0 was located in the center of a larger spherical container with radius r1 to form two concentric spheres (5Tsoukias N.M. Popel A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H2265-H2277Google Scholar, 6Liu X. Samouilov A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26194-26199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). NO was generated at a constant rate V0 in the solution between the two concentric spherical surfaces and diffused into the RBC (the inner sphere). The radius of the RBC, r0, is 2.44 μm (16Altman P.L. Dittmer D.S. Biology Data Book. 2nd Ed. FASEB, Bethesda, MD1974: 1598-1613Google Scholar, 17Russell J.A. Kindig C.A. Behnke B.J. Poole D.C. Musch T.I. Am. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26194-26199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the ratio of the RBC volume to the whole solution volume, defines the radius of the outer sphere, r1, as follows.Hct=r03r13,orr1=r0/Hct3(Eq.1) The following equations describe the diffusion problem after a steady-state NO concentration is reached,D1r2ddr(r2d[NO]dr)+V0=0(Eq.2) d[NO]dr=0atr=r1(Eq.3) [NO]=[NO]matr=r0(Eq.4) where D is the NO diffusion coefficient, V0 is the NO generation rate in solution, and [NO]m is the NO concentration at the RBC membrane surface. The rate of NO autoxidation in solution is slow when NO concentration is low. When NO concentration is 1 μm or below, its half-life is more than 100 s (15Liu X. Liu Q. Gupta E. Zorko N. Brownlee E. Zweier J.L. Nitric Oxide. 2005; 13: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Lewis R.S. Deen W.M. Chem. Res.

Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the steady-state NO concentration in the presence of RBCs is much lower than 1 μm. Based on the reported rate of NO consumption by 2 × 106 RBCs/ml (2Liu X. Miller M.J. Joshi M.S. Sadowska-Krowicka H. Clark D.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18709-18713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), it can be calculated that all rates of NO consumption by RBCs in the range of Hct used in our experiments are at least 100 times higher than the rate of NO autoxidation. Therefore, the rate of NO autoxidation is ignored in Equation 2. The solution of Equations 2, 3, 4 gives the following.[NO]=-V0r26D+[NO]m+V03D(r022+r13r0)-V0r133Dr(Eq.5) The rate of NO diffusion into the RBCs, ν, can be derived from Equation 5. Considering that the rate ν is also equal to 4π r02Pm[NO]m, we have the following.v=4πr02Dd[NO]dr|r=r0=4πr02DV03D(r13-r03r02)=4πV03(r12-r03)=4πr02Pm[NO]m(Eq.6) [NO]m=V0(r13-r03)3Pmr02=V0r0(1-Hct)3PmHctEq.7 Substitution of Equation 7 into Equation 5 gives the following.[NO]=V06D[2D(r13-r03)Pmr02+r02+2r13r0-(r2+2r13r)](Eq.8) The bulk NO concentration in the solution at r = r1 can be obtained from Equations 5 and 7 as follows,[NO]b=[NO]m+V0(r1-r0)2(2r1+r0)6Dr0=V0r023Hct(1-HctPmr0+(1-HCT1/3)2(2+Hct1/3)2D)=kSV0(Eq.9) where ks is the slope of the plot of [NO]b versus V0, which is given in the following form.ks=r023Hct(1-HctPmr0+(1-Hct1/3)2(2+Hct1/3)2D)(Eq.10) If Hct ≪ 1, we have the following.3Hct[NO]bV0r02=1-HctPmr0+(1-Hct1/3)2(2+Hct1/3)2D=1-HctPmr0+2+Hct-3Hct1/32D≈1Pmro+1D-3Hct1/32D(Eq.11) Equation 9 shows that the steady-state NO concentration in the bulk solution (r = r1), [NO]b, consists of two terms. The first term [NO]m is the NO concentration on the outer membrane of a RBC, which is inversely proportional to the membrane permeability Pm. The second term is the NO concentration difference between the outer membrane of the RBC and the bulk solution, which is independent of the permeability of the RBC membrane. If we use [NO]aq to represent the second item in Equation 9, we have the following.[NO]aq=V0r02(1-Hct1/3)2(2+Hct1/3)6D(Hct)(Eq.12) Although [NO]aq is independent of Pm, [NO]m increases as Pm decreases. Thus, [NO]b will also increase as Pm decreases, because [NO]b is the sum of [NO]aq and [NO]m. Equation 9 also shows that [NO]b is proportional to the rate of NO injection into the solution, V0. From the slope of the plot of [NO]b versus V0, we can determine the membrane permeability Pm based on Equation 9. Formation of Steady-state NO Concentration in the Presence of RBCs—To form a steady-state NO concentration, NO was first continuously injected into the phosphate-buffered saline solution at a constant rate by a Hamilton syringe driven with a syringe pump. The NO concentration increased linearly. The rate of NO generation in the solution was determined from the slope of the initial linear increase of NO concentration in the solution. When the NO concentration in the solution reached ∼1 μm, a certain amount of RBCs was added into the solution. It was observed that the NO concentration in the solution rapidly decreased but did not reach zero. Instead, the NO concentration reached a steady state. However, the steady-state NO concentration rapidly decreased to the base line ([NO] = 0) after NO injection was stopped (Fig. 1). The Effect of NO Injection Rate (V0) and Hct on Steady-state NO Concentrations—Because a steady-state NO concentration is reached when the NO consumption rate equals the NO generation rate, we examined how the NO generation and consumption rates change the steady-state level of NO concentration. It was observed that the steady-state NO concentration detected by NO electrodes linearly increase with the rate of NO injection as predicted from Equation 9 (Fig. 2). In the measurements, Hct was 0.0475% and temperature was 37 °C. The slope ks value of the best fitting line to the plot of [NO] versus V0 is 1.12 ± 0.02 s. From Equation 10, we know that ks contains terms including Pm and D. If it is assumed that Pmr0 is much greater than D, so that the first term (1/Pmr0) can be ignored, then we can obtain D = 3290 ± 60 μm2 s–1. If Pmr0 is not large enough and 1/Pmr0 cannot be ignored, then D would be >3290 μm2 s–1. Thus, 3290 μm2 s–1 can be considered the lower limit of D in the solution used in our experiments. Using Equation 11, we plotted 3Hct[NO]b/V0r02 versus 3Hct⅓ /2 (Fig. 3). From the slope, we obtained the diffusion coefficient D = (3.41 ± 0.05) × 103 μm2 s–1. Substituting the experimentally determined D and ks values into Equation 10, we can obtain the RBC membrane permeability, Pm = 4.5 ± 1.5 cm/s.FIGURE 3Determination of the NO diffusion coefficient in solution. Steady-state NO concentrations were formed in the solution containing RBCs at different Hct. The experimental data were plotted using Equation 11. SigmaPlot 9.0 was used to fit the experimental data points (closed circles). The slope of the best fitting line (solid line) was found to be (–2.93 ± 0.05) × 10–4 μm–2s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Simulation of the Effect of RBC Membrane Permeability and Hematocrit on Steady-state NO Concentrations—Equation 8 was used to simulate how NO concentrations change with RBC membrane permeability and Hct. Fig. 4 shows four sets of simulated curves at Hct = 0.0475% (Fig. 4A) and four sets of curves at Hct = 45% (Fig. 4B). The permeability of the RBC membrane in panels a–d was assumed to be 415, 4,000, 45,000, and 400,000 μm/s, respectively. The [NO] curves from the lowest to highest in each panel were obtained at V0 = 1, 5, 20, and 100 nm/s, respectively. The steady-state NO concentration is slightly higher than 100 nm at V0 = 100 nm/s and Hct = 0.0475% if Pm ≥ 4.5 cm/s, whereas the steady-state NO concentration is >500 nm when Pm = 415 μm/s. When Hct = 45%, the steady state NO concentration is <0.25 nm, even when Pm is as low as 415 μm/s and V0 is as high as 100 nm/s. The steady-state NO concentration is only in the pm range when Pm ≥ 4.5 cm/s, even when V0 is as high as 100 nm/s. In this study, an experimental method was developed and used in combination with mathematical modeling to determine the steady-state NO concentrations in solutions containing RBCs. We first demonstrated that a steady-state NO concentration could be reached in a solution containing RBCs when NO is added to the solution at a constant rate (Fig. 1). Equations derived from the diffusion-reaction in the concentric sphere model show that the ratio (ks) of the steady-state NO concentration in bulk solution to NO generation rate is a constant related to Hct, D, and Pm. We have experimentally determined ks at a given Hct (Fig. 2). By ignoring the term containing 1/Pmr0 in the expression of ks (Equation 10), we estimated that the lower limit of the NO diffusion coefficient D at 37 °C is 3290 μm2/s. This lower limit of D is close to the reported NO coefficient measured at 37 °C (D = 3300 μm2/s) (20Malinski T. Taha Z. Grunfeld S. Patton S. Kapturczak M. Tomboulian P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1076-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and the recently reported NO diffusion coefficient that was extrapolated to 37 °C from 25 °C (D = 3000 μm2/s) (21Zacharia I.G. Deen W.M. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 2005; 33: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), implying that Pmr0 is much greater than D and 1/Pmr0 could indeed be ignored in Equation 10. Furthermore, we directly measured the bulk [NO], [NO]b, at different Hct values and applied Equation 11 to analyze the experimental data (Fig. 3). We found that D = (3.41 ± 0.05) × 103 μm2/s and Pm = 4.5 ± 1.5 cm/s at 37 °C. To predict how Pm affects the steady-state NO concentration at high Hct, simulations were performed based on Equation 8 (Fig. 4). These simulation results show that [NO]b is proportional to V0 at a given Pm and markedly decreases as Pm increases from 0.0415 to 4.5 cm/s. At Pm = 4.5 cm/s and Hct = 45%, the ratio of NO concentration on the RBC membrane surface [NO]m to [NO]b is 18% (Fig. 4B). This indicates that the resistance of the membrane to NO is still small compared with the resistance of the extracellular unstirred solution in the physiological Hct range, based on the Pm and D measured in our experiments. In 1927, Hartridge and Roughton (22Hartridge H.H. Roughton F.J.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1927; 62: 232-242Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) observed that the rate of O2 uptake by red blood cells was 20–40 times slower than that by cell-free Hb. In earlier studies, the slow uptake rate was attributed to the resistance of the RBC cell membrane (23Nicolson P. Roughton F.J.W. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1951; 138: 241-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Roughton F.J.W. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1932; 111: 1-36Crossref Google Scholar). However, in later reports between the 1960s and 1980s, a body of evidence showed that the membrane has little or no resistance to O2 diffusion (25Kreuzer F. Yahr W.Z. J. Appl. Physiol. 1960; 15: 1117-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Kutchai H. Staub N.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1969; 53: 576-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Coin J.T. Olson J.S. J.

J. 1984; 45: 825-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Theoretical analyses and experimental data show that the slow rate of oxygen uptake by RBCs and its time course can be explained very well when it is assumed that the extracellular unstirred solution layer provides the main resistance to O2 uptake by RBCs (29Huxley V.H. Kutchai H. Microvasc. Res. 1983; 26: 89-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30Vandegriff K.D. Olson J.S. Biophys. J. 1984; 45: 825-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It had also been observed that the initial rate of O2 uptake by RBCs was linear with the O2 diffusion coefficient in the extracellular solution, and the membrane accounted for ∼5% of the total resistance to O2 transfer into RBCs (28Huxley V.H. Kutchai H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1981; 316: 75-83Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It seemed that these controversies ended in the middle of the 1980s with a general acceptance that the extracellular unstirred solution layer is responsible for the slow O2 uptake rate by RBCs. In 1958, similar to the rate of O2 uptake by RBCs, it was observed that the rate of NO consumption by RBC-encapsulated Hb is much slower than NO consumption by cell-free Hb (31Carlsen E. Comroe Jr., J.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1958; 42: 83-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). After measuring the decay kinetics of NO in solutions containing RBCs and theoretically analyzing the experimental data, it was demonstrated that the rate of NO consumption by RBCs can be predicted by a mathematical model, with the assumption that the extracellular diffusion of NO limits the rate of NO entry into RBCs (2Liu X. Miller M.J. Joshi M.S. Sadowska-Krowicka H. Clark D.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18709-18713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). These results indicated that the permeability of the RBC membrane is large for O2 as well as NO. Liao and co-workers (3Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) used a competition experimental method to measure the ratio of the rate of NO transfer into RBCs (krbc) and the rate of NO reaction with extracellular free Hb (kHb). They observed that krbc is 500–1000 times slower than kHb. They suggested that RBC membrane resistance is the main resistance, because the NO concentration gradient was considered to have been eliminated in their experimental design after Hct was >5%. Using a mathematical model, the same group simulated extracellular methemoglobin formation measured at different Hct values in competition experiments. They estimated that the permeability of the RBC membrane to NO is 415 μm/s (32Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5: 18-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which is 2–3 orders of magnitude smaller than the reported permeability of the cell membrane and lipid membrane (20Malinski T. Taha Z. Grunfeld S. Patton S. Kapturczak M. Tomboulian P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1076-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 33Subczynski W.K. Lomnicka M. Hyde J.S. Free Radic. Res. 1996; 24: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 34Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Lissi E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A detailed mathematical analysis on the reaction system containing both RBCs and free Hb was given by Tsoukias and Popel (5Tsoukias N.M. Popel A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H2265-H2277Google Scholar) based on the concentric sphere model. Their calculated results demonstrated that competition data can be satisfactorily simulated on the assumption that extracellular diffusion is the main resistance to NO transfer into the RBCs. To do so, it just requires using the NO diffusion coefficient D at 25 °C and extrapolating the reported value of kHb from 20 to 25 °C rather than using the very low RBC membrane permeability suggested by Liao and co-workers (32Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5: 18-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This result was also demonstrated in our previous paper (6Liu X. Samouilov A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26194-26199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), in which we also showed that the NO concentration distribution close to the RBC membrane had little change when Hct increased from 1.6 to 10%, and the extracellular diffusion resistance could not be eliminated for a large Pm value even after Hct was >10%. This is different from the original assumption in Liao's paper that extracellular diffusion resistance was eliminated when Hct was >5%. These simulations show that the results from competition experiments are not necessarily explained by a very low permeability of the RBC membrane. Recently, Kim-Shapiro and colleagues (4Azarov I. Huang K.T. Basu S. Gladwin M.T. Hogg N. Kim-Shapiro D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39024-39032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) measured NO consumption by RBCs at different Hct levels. They observed that the rate of NO consumption by RBCs increases ∼3-fold when Hct increases from 15 to 50%. It is worth noting that a nearly 3-fold increase in the rate of NO consumption by RBCs can be obtained from the expression for krbc/kHb that was derived solely based on the assumption of extracellular diffusion resistance (6Liu X. Samouilov A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26194-26199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, their results obtained from competition experiments indicate that extracellular diffusion resistance is the main resistance for NO transfer into RBCs as Hct increases to 50%. In Fig. 4, we demonstrated the effect of Hct, V0, and Pm on the steady-state NO concentration in solution containing RBCs. As shown in Fig. 4A, the simulated [NO]b at the low Hct value can reach a level of >100 nm when Pm ≥ 4.5 cm/s and V0 = 100 nm/s. This simulated [NO]b is close to our experimental data (see data at V0 = 100 nm/s in Fig. 2) under the experimental conditions similar to those in the simulation. However, when Pm = 0.0415 cm/s, the simulated [NO]b is >500 nm when V0 = 100 nm/s, which is ∼5 times higher than our experimental results, indicating that the small Pm (0.0415 cm/s) suggested by Liao and colleagues (32Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5: 18-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) is much smaller than the real value. Under physiological conditions, Hct is between 40 and 50%, so we simulated the steady-state NO concentration in the solution containing RBCs at 45%. Although [NO]b at Pm = 0.0415 cm/s is ∼20 times greater than [NO]b at Pm = 4.5 cm/s, the highest [NO]b at Pm = 0.0415 cm/s and V0 = 100 nm/s is <0.25 nm (Fig. 4B, panel a). Calculations based on Equation 9 show that, in blood at Pm = 4.5 cm/s, the NO generation rate must be greater than ∼80 μm/s to reach a steady-state NO concentration of 10 nm, a concentration necessary to produce 30–50% maximal vasodilation. If NO were generated at this rate, all of the Hb in the blood would be oxidized within 2 min! Even if Pm is assumed to be as small as 0.0415 cm/s, V0 must still be greater than 4 μm/s to reach a 10 nm steady-state NO concentration. At this rate, all Hb in the blood could be oxidized in 40 min. The required NO generation rate is still too high to be reasonable under physiological conditions. Thus, even though NO may be generated in blood plasma, on the RBC membrane, or exported from RBCs, it is unreasonable to consider that the resulting intravascular NO will provide significant signaling for vasodilation, because its concentration would be too low to exert a physiological role. It was reported that infusion of nitrite induces vasodilation in humans and that NO, a potent vasodilator, was generated from nitrite reduction in the presence of deoxyhemoglobin (deoxyHb) in vitro (13Cosby K. Partovi K.S. Crawford J.H. Patel R.P. Reiter C.D. Martyr S. Yang B.K. Waclawiw M.A. Zalos G. Xu X. Huang K.T. Shields H. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Schechter A.N. Cannon III, R.O. Gladwin M.T. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1498-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Although these experimental results may suggest that nitrite reduction to NO by deoxyHb is responsible for the vasodilation, it is unlikely that NO is the primary product from the nitrite reduction. The reported rate of NO generation from the reaction of 200 μm nitrite with 1 mm deoxy-RBC Hb measured in vitro was <50 pm/s, which is more than four orders of magnitude smaller than the necessary generation rate for reaching a steady-state physiological NO concentration in the blood. This excludes NO itself from being the primary NO equivalent derived from nitrite reduction by deoxyRBC Hb. In a recent review, Robinson and Lancaster (35Robinson J.M. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) compared the rate of NO escape from RBCs with the rate of NO generation from endothelium. They found that the rate of NO escape from RBCs is too small to cause vasodilation, so they pointed out that NO is unlikely to be the primary NOx involved in the nitrite-induced vasodilation. However, this does not rule out the possibility that NO could be a secondary product from the NO equivalent generated in the blood or exported from RBCs (11Pawloski J.R. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 12Gladwin M.T. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 35Robinson J.M. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), such as N2O3. The species N2O3 is an attractive candidate in the RBC-generated NO equivalents, because it may be delivered over a much longer distance before NO is released or nitrosothiols are formed. Our results also indicate that changing RBC membrane permeability is unlikely to play a physiological role in the regulation of NO concentration in blood. Because we have observed that NO concentration in blood would be well below the range of concentrations (1–1000 nm) that exert physiological effects, changes in membrane permeability would not exert functional effects. In conclusion, our results show that, even for high levels of NO generation of 100 nm/s, the intravascular concentration of NO would be far too low to exert functional effects. Reaction of NO with RBC Hb greatly limits intravascular NO concentrations. Thus, it is unlikely that NO is directly exported or generated from the RBC as an intravascular signaling molecule. Our results suggest that, if RBCs export NO bioactivity, this would be through species that can release or form NO, rather than NO itself. We thank Dr. Lawrence J. Druhan for helpful discussion in the preparation of this manuscript."

We examined the putative cross-talk between insulin and IL-6 in adipose cells and found that insulin exerts an inhibitory effect on the IL-6 signaling pathway by altering the post-translational modifications of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Insulin reduces the tyrosine phosphorylation and increases the serine phosphorylation of STAT3, thereby reducing its nuclear localization and transcriptional activity. Signaling through the MEK/MAPK pathway plays an important role as treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 reduces the effects of insulin on IL-6 signaling. We also show that the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 is activated upon insulin signaling and is required for the dephosphorylation of STAT3 and that insulin exerts a synergistic effect with IL-6 on suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 expression. As a consequence, the IL-6-induced expression of the inflammatory markers serum amyloid A 3 and haptoglobin are significantly decreased in cells incubated with both IL-6 and insulin. Thus, insulin exerts an important anti-inflammatory effect in adipose cells by impairing the IL-6 signal at several levels.

Thus, insulin exerts an important anti-inflammatory effect in adipose cells by impairing the IL-6 signal at several levels. Adipose tissue has long been regarded as important only for the storage and release of lipids. It is now known to be the largest endocrine organ in the body, secreting cytokines, hormones, and growth factors (commonly referred to as adipokines) that are important paracrine/endocrine regulators (1Hammarstedt A. Andersson C.X. Rotter Sopasakis V. Smith U. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2005; 73: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Adipose tissue is also thought to play an important role in the low-grade chronic inflammation associated with obesity and insulin resistance (1Hammarstedt A. Andersson C.X. Rotter Sopasakis V. Smith U. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2005; 73: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Obesity and enlarged fat cells alter the pattern of secreted adipokines, favoring release of the inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), 2The abbreviations used are: IL-6, interleukin 6; SOCS, suppressor of cytokine signaling; gp130, glycoprotein 130; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; SH, Src homology; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; SAA, serum amyloid A; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. and reducing the anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing adipokine, adiponectin (1Hammarstedt A.

IL-6 is an important activator of inflammation in both liver and adipose tissue. Interestingly, the IL-6 concentration in the interstitial fluid of the adipose tissue is ∼50-fold higher than in circulation, which strongly supports its role as an important regulator in this tissue (2Sopasakis V.R. Sandqvist M. Gustafson B. Hammarstedt A. Schmelz M. Yang X. Jansson P.A. Smith U. Obes. Res. 2004; 12: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In addition, the adipose tissue accounts for ∼30% of the circulating IL-6 concentration (3Mohamed-Ali V. Goodrick S. Rawesh A. Katz D.R. Miles J.M. Yudkin J.S. Klein S. Coppack S.W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 4196-4200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that IL-6 impairs insulin signaling. For example, IL-6 has been shown to reduce expression of adiponectin in human adipose tissue and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and glucose transporter 4 in 3T3-L1 cells (2Sopasakis V.R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 45777-45784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). IL-6 is also a well known inducer of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins (5Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar), and induction of SOCS1 and SOCS3 has been shown to inhibit insulin signaling by binding to the insulin receptor and IRS-1 (6Shi H.

Science. 1987; 237: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Intracellular IL-6 signaling is initiated by the interaction of IL-6 with a plasma membrane receptor complex containing the signal transducer glycoprotein 130 (gp130). This results in the activation of Janus kinases, allowing tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130. In turn, this recruits signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family members, such as STAT3, but also other Src homology 2 domain (SH2)-containing proteins, including the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2. STAT3 is phosphorylated by Janus kinase at Tyr-705, which is considered crucial for the homo- or heterodimerization of STAT3 to either STAT3 or STAT1, enabling nuclear translocation (9Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-727 in STAT3 has been reported to be important for transcriptional activation, but the evidence is contradictory. Some reports have shown that serine phosphorylation increases the transcriptional activation of STAT3 (10Abe K. Hirai M. Mizuno K. Higashi N. Sekimoto T. Miki T. Hirano T. Nakajima K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31055-31061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), whereas others have shown that it reduces or has no effect on transcriptional activity (15Jain N. Zhang T. Kee W.H. Li W. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24392-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24542-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). There are also reports indicating that the serine and tyrosine phosphorylations may negatively regulate each other (16Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The effect of Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT3 may vary according to cell type, the kinase pathway activated, and the cytokine or growth factor used. In this study, we have further investigated the cross-talk between insulin and IL-6 and asked whether insulin alters the IL-6 signaling pathway in 3T3-L1 cells. It has previously been implicated that insulin has an anti-inflammatory effect in vivo and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells through an effect on reactive oxygen species generation and NF-κB activation (19Dandona P. Aljada A. Mohanty P. Ghanim H. Hamouda W. Assian E. Ahmad S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 3257-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Our results show that preincubation of 3T3-L1 cells with insulin significantly reduces the transcriptional activity of STAT3, thus reducing the transcription of the IL-6-induced inflammatory proteins SAA3 and haptoglobin. This is accomplished through a reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and, consequently, nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity in response to IL-6. We also provide evidence that STAT3 tyrosine and serine phosphorylations are regulated by insulin through the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and the MEK/MAPK signaling pathway, respectively. We conclude that insulin exerts anti-inflammatory effects in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by modulating the intracellular IL-6 signaling pathway. Cell Cultures—3T3-L1 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Differentiation was induced in post-confluent 3T3-L1 cells by adding a differentiation mixture (500 μm 3-isobutyl-1 methylxantine, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 10 μm dexamethasone) for 2 days. The cells were then allowed to grow for another 2 days in supplemented DMEM with 5 μg/ml insulin followed by 4 days in normal supplemented DMEM (i.e. no insulin or differentiation mixture). On day 8, medium was changed to DMEM with 1.5% fetal bovine serum for 12 h. The cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and grown for another 12 h in DMEM with 0.5% bovine serum albumin before starting the experiment. The MEFs were starved for 16 h in DMEM with 0.5% bovine serum albumin before the insulin/IL-6 additions. The cells were then incubated with 20 ng/ml IL-6 with or without 100 nm insulin for different times. Insulin was usually added 10 min before IL-6. PD98059 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) (40 μm) was added 30 min before IL-6. Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot—Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm orthovanadate, 100 nm okadaic acid, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm AEBSF) was then added to the cells, and the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Preparation of nuclear lysate followed the recommendation of the manufacturer of the STAT3 transcription factor assay (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Purity of the nuclear fraction was verified by immunoblotting for proteins abundant in the cytoplasm. Protein concentration was measured by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations were made by adding 30 μl of Protein G-coupled Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway) that had been preincubated for 1 h with 1 μg of α-gp130 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) to 100 μg of cell lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The lysate (or immunoprecipitated proteins) was boiled in SDS loading buffer and applied on 7.5% SDS-PAGE (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD). Following gel transference, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween 20 for 1 h. Membranes were probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation for 1 h with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution. Proteins were visualized by ECL substrate (Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies (pY705-STAT3, pY542-SHP2, pY694-STAT5, and pT202/Y204-p44/42 MAPK) were all from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA) and diluted 1:1000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. STAT3 (BD Biosciences) monoclonal antibody was diluted 1:2000, and pS727-STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was diluted 1:500. Transcriptional Activity of STAT3—Nuclear lysates from differentiated 3T3-L1 cells treated with IL-6 and insulin for 15, 30, and 60 min were analyzed using a STAT3 transcription factor assay kit (Chemicon International) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Reverse Transcriptase PCR and Quantitation Analysis—RNA was isolated with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and the following reverse transcriptase PCR for cDNA preparation was made using the High Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Relative quantification was made using the ABI Prism 7700 Sequencing Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Primers and probes were designed using Primer Express software, and sequences are available upon request. Statistical Analysis—All statistical analyses were performed in Microsoft Excel, and statistical significances were evaluated with the paired Student's t test when appropriate. Effect of Insulin on Tyr-705 Phosphorylation of STAT3—To study the effects of insulin on IL-6-induced activation of STAT3, Western blot analysis was used to determine the phosphorylation of Tyr-705 of STAT3 in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes following incubation with IL-6 and/or insulin. The IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 occurred rapidly (data not shown), and insulin did not exert an immediate effect on the phosphorylation of Tyr-705 of STAT3. However, after 30 min a consistent reduction was seen in cells treated with both IL-6 and insulin compared with cells treated with IL-6 alone (Fig. 1A, upper panel). The STAT3 protein content was not altered by any of the additions (lower panel). Effect of Insulin on Immunoprecipitation of gp130 and STAT3—As IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation occurs when STAT3 is bound to the gp130 receptor, we investigated the effect of insulin on the interaction between STAT3 and gp130 using co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Lysates from differentiated 3T3-L1 cells treated for 120 min with insulin and/or IL-6 were immunoprecipitated with an anti-gp130 antibody followed by immunoblotting for STAT3. The amount of STAT3 associated with gp130 was reduced in samples treated with both IL-6 and insulin compared with samples treated with IL-6 alone (Fig. 1B, upper panel). The blots were probed with α-gp130 antibody to verify that equal amounts of gp130 had been immunoprecipitated (lower panel). These results show that the reduction in IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in response to insulin is associated with a decreased binding of STAT3 to gp130. Effect of Insulin on Nuclear Localization of STAT3—We investigated the effect of insulin on IL-6-induced dimerization and nuclear translocation of STAT3, as these events are dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation (20Milocco L.H. Haslam J.A. Rosen J. Seidel H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2913-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Nuclear lysates were prepared and analyzed for STAT3 after 15–60-min incubations with IL-6 and/or insulin. The level of STAT3 in the nucleus was reduced after 15 min in samples treated with both IL-6 and insulin compared with samples treated with IL-6 alone (Fig. 2A). This reduction was seen throughout the study period. Effect of Insulin on the Transcriptional Activation of STAT3—Using a STAT3 transcription factor assay, nuclear lysates from differentiated 3T3-L1 cells that had been incubated with IL-6 and/or insulin were analyzed. A significant reduction of the transcriptional activation was detected after 15 min in samples treated with IL-6 and insulin compared with samples treated with IL-6 alone (Fig. 2B). These results are in agreement with the results of nuclear translocation (Fig. 2A), and the insulin-induced reduction was also observed throughout the studied period. IL-6-induced Gene Expression—The inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin are strongly up-regulated by cytokines such as IL-6 (22Ramadori G. Van Damme J. Rieder H. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 1259-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 23do Nascimento C.O. Hunter L. Trayhurn P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 702-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We analyzed the gene expression of SAA3 and haptoglobin in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells that had been incubated with insulin and/or IL-6 for 24 h. Insulin significantly reduced the IL-6-induced expression of both SAA3 and haptoglobin mRNA (Fig. 3, A and B). IL-6 also up-regulates expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling SOCS3 (5Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). Exposure of differentiated 3T3-L1 cells to IL-6 for 60 min significantly increased the gene expression of SOCS3 ∼25-fold (Fig. 3C). In contrast to the gene expression of SAA3 and haptoglobin, addition of insulin increased the IL-6-induced expression of SOCS3 (Fig. 3C). In an attempt to explain this finding, we examined the effect of insulin on STAT5, as previous studies have shown that STAT5B is activated by insulin and enhances SOCS3 expression (7Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Immunoblots showed an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in samples treated with IL-6 or insulin alone for 60 min, but the phosphorylation was greater in the presence of both insulin and IL-6 (Fig. 3D). This indicates that IL-6 and insulin can synergistically activate STAT5, supporting the suggestion that SOCS3 expression can be induced by both STAT3 and STAT5 activation. Involvement of SHP2—We examined the effect of insulin on the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, as this enzyme is known to exert a regulating effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (9Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of lysates from differentiated 3T3-L1 cells that had been incubated with IL-6 and/or insulin showed that insulin slowly increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2, which in turn is associated with enzyme activation (Fig. 4A). To further investigate the importance of SHP2 in STAT3 phosphorylation, we studied MEFs from mice expressing a mutant variant of SHP2 where the SH2 domains that are necessary for SHP2 activity had been deleted (24Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The kinase-dead MEFs showed a high degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in the basal state, and this was not altered by IL-6 and/or insulin (Fig. 4B). These findings support the importance of SHP2 for regulating the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. Effect of Insulin on Ser-727 Phosphorylation of STAT3—Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT3 has been shown to either activate or inhibit STAT3, depending on cell type (10Abe K. Hirai M. Mizuno K.

Biol. 2000; 10: 47-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was used to determine the phosphorylation of Ser-727 of STAT3 in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes following incubation with insulin and/or IL-6. Insulin alone caused a rapid (≤15 min) phosphorylation of Ser-727 (data not shown) that remained throughout the 120-min experiment, whereas the IL-6-induced phosphorylation of Ser-727 declined after 60 min (Fig. 5). Insulin also increased the IL-6-induced phosphorylation of Ser-727 compared with the effect of IL-6 alone (Fig. 5). Interaction of MAPK Signaling Pathway on IL-6 Signaling—It has previously been reported that the MEK inhibitor PD98059 inhibits serine phosphorylation of STAT3 in a Raf-inducible fibroblast cell line (16Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the MAPK signaling pathway affects STAT3 signaling in 3T3-L1 cells, these cells were pretreated with PD98059 30 min before addition of insulin and/or IL-6 for 120 min. Insulin caused an increase in the levels of phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2, and this was reduced by the addition of PD98059 (Fig. 6A). The results showed that the insulin-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT3 was not only antagonized by the presence of PD98059 but, interestingly, the ability of insulin to antagonize the IL-6-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was also prevented in cells pretreated with PD98059 (Fig. 6A). To further analyze the cross-talk between the MEK/MAPK pathway and the effect of insulin on IL-6 signaling, the nuclear localization and transcriptional activation of STAT3 were studied in 3T3-L1 cells pretreated with PD98059 before addition of insulin and/or IL-6 for 15 min. The ability of insulin to reduce the IL-6-stimulated nuclear localization of STAT3 was almost completely inhibited in the presence of PD98059 (Fig. 6B). Similarly, insulin had no significant inhibitory effect on the IL-6-induced transcriptional activation of STAT3 in cells pretreated with PD98059 (Fig. 6C). In this report, we show that preincubation of 3T3-L1 cells with insulin: 1) reduced the IL-6-induced Tyr-705 phosphorylation of STAT3; 2) reduced the IL-6-induced coprecipitation of gp130 and STAT3; 3) reduced the IL-6-induced nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of STAT3; 4) reduced the IL-6-induced gene expression of SAA3 and haptoglobin; and 5) increased the IL-6-induced Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT3. In addition, we show the inhibitory effect of insulin was regulated by SHP2 and the MEK/MAPK signaling pathway. IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is required for the dimerization of STATs through their SH2 domains (21Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), and formation of STAT dimers is required for nuclear translocation (9Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2913-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with our study showing that the insulin-induced reduction of IL-6-stimulated STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation was accompanied by a reduced nuclear localization of STAT3 as well as a reduced activation of the proinflammatory genes SAA3 and haptoglobin. The reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 seems, in part, to be mediated through SHP2 as this protein tyrosine phosphatase is activated by insulin with a similar time course as the reduced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. SHP2 not only interacts with STAT3 (26Gunaje J.J. Bhat G.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 252-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Wang C.Z. Su H.W. Hsu Y.C. Shen M.R.

Our results support this, as we found a reduced co-precipitation of gp130 and STAT3 in the presence of IL-6 and insulin. The same samples also showed an increased coprecipitation between SHP2 and STAT3 (data not shown). The importance of SHP2 was further supported by the finding that MEFs lacking a functional SHP2 activity showed an increased Tyr-705 phosphorylation of STAT3 in both the basal and IL-6-stimulated states. In addition, overexpression of wild-type SHP2 in MEFs completely inhibited IL-6-induced expression of the inflammatory marker genes SAA3 and haptoglobin (data not shown). Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT3 has previously been described to either activate or inhibit the transcriptional properties of STAT3 in different cells (10Abe K. Hirai M. Mizuno K. Higashi N.

The controversial effect of Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT3 may depend on cell type, the kinase pathway activated, and/or the cytokine/growth factor used. Our study suggests that serine phosphorylation is inhibitory for the transcriptional activity of STAT3 in 3T3-L1 cells. We found that Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT3 was rapidly increased by insulin, which is in agreement with a previous study showing that insulin-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT3 occurs within 5 min (32Ceresa B.P. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12121-12124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). IL-6-induced Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT3 declined more rapidly than that seen with insulin, which indicates that Ser-727 phosphorylation by IL-6 and insulin is mediated through different serine/threonine kinases. As several serine/threonine kinases have been described to phosphorylate Ser-727, including ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, protein kinase C δ, and mTOR kinase (10Abe K. Hirai M. Mizuno K. Higashi N. Sekimoto T.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4131-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we used specific inhibitors to some of the known pathways involved in order to define the mechanism involved. Specifically, we inhibited the p38, JNK, MEK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and mTOR pathways. However, the MEK inhibitor PD98059, which blocks signaling upstream of ERK1/2, was found to reduce all the studied effects of insulin on STAT3 signaling (i.e. alterations of Ser and Tyr phosphorylations, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity). Also, other studies have found that inhibition of the MEK signaling pathway alters STAT3 phosphorylation and that this can alter the transcriptional activity (16Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 34Krasilnikov M. Ivanov V.N. Dong J. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4092-4101Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Because we were unable to find any insulin-associated changes in the Janus kinase 2-STAT3 interactions (data not shown), we focused on the role of SHP2 for the reduction of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin. However, it is unlikely that the rather late effect of insulin on SHP2 activation can solely account for the rapid inhibitory action on STAT3 transcriptional activation as seen in Fig. 2B. To explain this difference, we speculate that the rapid induction of Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT3 by insulin plays a role in the early reduction of nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of STAT3 in response to IL-6. Such an effect could be mediated by the impaired binding of STAT3 to gp130 seen in the presence of insulin. The later activation of SHP2 by insulin and the associated gradual reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 would then serve as a mechanism to turn off the IL-6 signal. Interestingly, preliminary experiments indicate that SHP2 can directly interact with STAT3 in an insulin-dependent manner (data not shown), which supports that STAT3 is a substrate for the phosphatase SHP2. This is in accordance with data previously presented by Wang et al. (27Wang C.Z. Su H.W. Hsu Y.C. Shen M.R. Tang M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2839-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). STAT3 regulates expression of SOCS1–7. This family of proteins contains a central SH2 domain that interacts with Tyr-759 of gp130 to inhibit STAT3 activation, thus acting as negative feedback regulators of STAT signaling (5Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J.

SOCS3 is rapidly induced by IL-6 stimulation, and expression of this enzyme peaks within 1 h (5Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). As we found that insulin reduced the transcriptional activity of STAT3, one would expect a reduced expression of SOCS3. We found, however, that the IL-6-induced expression of SOCS3 was increased by insulin. To address the possible mechanisms for this effect of insulin, we investigated other transcription factors (STATs) that target induction of SOCS3, including STAT5B (7Emanuelli B. Peraldi P.

(7Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), we did not find a clear increase of SOCS3 expression in samples incubated with insulin alone, but we showed that IL-6 and insulin synergistically activated SOCS3, probably through an increased activation of STAT5. These findings provide a mechanism whereby insulin can increase SOCS3 expression while concomitantly reducing STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and transcriptional activity. The synergistic effect of IL-6 and insulin on SOCS3 expression is an additional mechanism whereby insulin can turn off the IL-6 signal; in addition, the insulin signal as SOCS3 is a feedback inhibitor to insulin (7Emanuelli B.

The ability of insulin to antagonize IL-6 signaling, and induction of inflammatory proteins like SAA3 and haptoglobin, shows that insulin exerts anti-inflammatory effects in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

The increase of ion conductance by AtDHAR1 is better explained by a CLIC-like channel activity than by a modification of endogenous channel proteins. Anion channels are present in the plasma membrane and endomembranes of all eukaryotes. While the functional properties of these channels in plants were well characterized over the last decade with electrophysiological methods (reviewed in Ref. 1Barbier-Brygoo H. Vinauger M. Colcombet J. Ephritikhine G. Frachisse J. Maurel C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 199-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) the molecular characterization of the unerlying channel proteins is far behind. The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana contains several genes with a high homology to animal anion channels of the chloride channel (CLC) family (2Hechenberger M. Schwappach B. Fischer W.N. Frommer W.B.

The Arabidopsis genome contains four genes, which share similarity with the animal family of chloride intracellular channels (CLICs) 2The abbreviations used are: CLIC, chloride intracellular channel; GST, gluthathion S-transferase; HEK, human embryo kidney; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DHAR, dehydrate ascorbate reductase; TEA, tetraethylammonium; GFP, green fluorescent protein. (3Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). This is a recently discovered family of anion channels, which have been reported to be present in vertebrates (4Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Eur. Biophys. J. 2002; 31: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 5Ashley R.H. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and invertebrates (6Berry K.L. Bulow H.E. Hall D.H. Hobert O. Science. 2003; 203: 2134-2137Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In vertebrates they are present in many different tissues and they are located predominantly in intracellular membranes (e.g. endoplasmic reticulum, trans-Golgi vesicles, and nuclear membrane). Under specific circumstances they can also be active in the plasma membrane (4Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Eur. Biophys. J. 2002; 31: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 7Warton K. Tonini R. Fairlie W.D. Matthews J.M. Valenzuela S.M. Qiu M.R. Wu W.M. Pankhurst S. Bauskin A.R. Harrop S.J. Campbell T.J.

Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Mazzanti M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). CLICs are rather unusual channels, because their proteins have been reported to be present in both a transmembrane and a soluble form (4Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Eur. Biophys.

It has therefore long been questioned whether these proteins are able to function as ion channels. However, recent data strongly favor the view that they have channel function. Evidence for channel activity relies on the functional reconstitution of the protein in lipid bilayers (5Ashley R.H. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 7Warton K. Tonini R. Fairlie W.D. Matthews J.M. Valenzuela S.M. Qiu M.R. Wu W.M. Pankhurst S. Bauskin A.R. Harrop S.J. Campbell T.J.

Tonini R. Fairlie W.D. Matthews J.M. Valenzuela S.M. Qiu M.R. Wu W.M. Pankhurst S. Bauskin A.R. Harrop S.J. Campbell T.J. Curmi P.M. Breit S.N. Mazzanti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26003-26011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Altogether the available data suggest a model according to which CLIC channels are inserted into the membrane upon a stimulus from the cytoplasm (11Littler D.R. Harrop S.J. Fairlie W.D. Brown L.J. Pankhurst G.J. Pankhurst S. DeMaere M.Z. Campbell T.J. Bauskin A.R. Tonini R. Mazzanti M. Breit S.N. Curmi P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9298-9305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus the channels seem to behave in a similar way to other channel-forming proteins such as bacterial toxins, the intracellular Bcl-Xl protein, and annexins (12Gouaux E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Moreover these proteins are able to undergo a reversible transition from a soluble cytosolic into an ion conducting, membrane inserted form (4Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Eur. Biophys. J. 2002; 31: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The structure of CLICs suggests that they are part of a protein super family of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) (4Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Eur. Biophys. J. 2002; 31: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Among other common features CLICs (from vertebrates), like GSTs, contain the same highly conserved domains for glutathione binding (4Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Eur. Biophys. J. 2002; 31: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). According to these structural criteria the four Arabidopsis proteins with similarity to CLICs are part of this GST super family (3Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). But compared with all other plant GSTs the four CLIC like Arabidopsis proteins have a cysteine rather than a serine in the active site. This structural feature relates them more closely to the mammalian type of omega glutathione transferases and CLICs than to the other plant GSTs (3Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Recent investigations by the same authors on localization and function of these unusual Arabidopsis GSTs have shown that three of the four proteins reveal glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reduction activity. For two of them a cytosolic localization is predicted; because of a specific targeting sequence the remaining two proteins are thought to be most likely present in the chloroplasts (3Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Animal and plant GSTs are well characterized by their role in detoxification: they are able to conjugate different toxins with glutathione. In addition to this well known function, GSTs from plants and animals also seem to perform other functions. These include, for example, a peroxidase and isomerase activity (4Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Eur. Biophys. J. 2002; 31: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Edwards R. Dixon D.P. Walbot V. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). With such a broad spectrum of activities it is not surprising that some of them, namely the CLICs, also function as ion channels. This hypothesis of multiple functions is also relevant in view of the fact that the genome of Arabidopsis contains more than 25 genes, which code for GSTs (13Edwards R. Dixon D.P. Walbot V. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 14Dixon D.P. Lapthorn A. Edwards R. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 30004.1-3004.10Crossref Google Scholar). This abundance may also suggest that plant GSTs have multiple functions. In the present work we are examining the possibility that a GST from Arabidopsis, which shares similarities with the animal CLICs, has ion channel activity. By heterologous expression of the plant homolog of animal CLICs in mammalian HEK293 cells, we show with patch clamp recordings that transfected cells reveal an elevated inward-rectifying conductance suggesting that this protein can produce an ion conductance.

PCR products were purified and ligated into BglII/EcoRI-digested pEGFP-N2 or pIRES-EGPP (both from Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) for expression in human embryo kidney (HEK293) cells or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Cells were transiently transfected using the liposomal transfection reagent metafectene (Biontex Laboratories, Munich, Germany). Sequence Analysis—Protein sequences were aligned and compared with T-coffee version 2.03. Structural predictions were obtained from PSIPRED algorithm (PSIPRED V2.5 by David Jones). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed on total protein extracted as described previously (15Moroni A. Viscomi C. Sangiorgio V. Pagliuca C. Meckel T. Horvath F. Gazzarrini S. Valbuzzi P. Van Etten L. DiFrancesco D. Thiel G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology—Experiments were performed on cells incubated after transfection at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2–3 days. On the day before the experiment, the cells were dispersed by trypsin and plated at a low density on 35-mm culture dishes and allowed to settle overnight. Dishes were then placed on the stage of an inverted microscope and single cells patch-clamped in the whole cell configuration according to standard methods (16Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15145) Google Scholar) using an EPC-7 (List, Darmstadt, Germany) or an EPC-9 Patch Clamp amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Pulse software (HEKA) or custom-made software. For electrical recordings cells were superfused at room temperature with a solution containing: 140 mm tetraethylammonium (TEA)-Cl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES/BTP (pH 7.5). Pipettes for cell-attached measurements contained the same buffer as the bath solution. For whole cell recordings the pipettes were filled with a solution containing 140 mm TEA-Cl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm GTP, 5 mm phosphocreatin, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES/BTP (pH 7.5). Mannitol was used to adjust the osmolarity of all solutions to ∼300 mosmol. The test voltage (V′) in cell-attached recordings is the sum of the inversed clamp voltage plus the unknown membrane voltage (Vm) of the HEK293 cells. Measurements of Vm in HEK293 cells transfected with AtDHAR1 revealed a Vm value close to 0 mV (–6 ± 3 mV; n = 8). This voltage was ignored in the analysis of the data. AtDHAR1 Has Structural Similarities to CLICs—Search with the human HsCLIC-1 identified four genes in A. thaliana (known as at-dhar1–4 (3Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar)) with an appreciable similarity to the human intracellular Cl– channel. Fig. 1A shows an alignment of the derived amino acid sequences of the plant AtDHAR1 and the human Cl– channel HsCLIC-1. The identity (27%) and homology (61%) between the two proteins is only moderate. However, even this is a high degree of identity/homology considering the heterogeneity among CLIC channels. The human HsCLIC-1 and CeEXC-4, a member of the CLIC family from Caenorhabditis elegans, for example exhibit only 17% identity. It is important to note that the homology of the plant protein with HsCLIC-1 (Fig. 1) is most pronounced in domains that are considered important for the human anion channel. This includes for example the GSH-binding domain XXCPFSQRXX and the putative transmembrane domain (Cromer et al. (4Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Eur. Biophys. J. 2002; 31: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)). Like HsCLIC-1 (17Harrop S.J. DeMaere M.Z. Fairlie W.D. Reztsova T. Valenzuela S.M. Mazzanti M. Tonini R. Qiu M.R. Jankova L. Warton K. Bauskin A.R. Wu W.M. Pankhurst S. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Curmi P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44993-50000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) the Arabidopsis protein also has a proline-rich stretch. The functionally important amino acids Gly-171 and Pro-66 in HsCLIC1 have their equivalents in AtDHAR1. Notably, however, the loop region with negative amino acids in HsCLIC-1 is absent in AtDHAR1 (11Littler D.R. Harrop S.J. Fairlie W.D. Brown L.J. Pankhurst G.J. Pankhurst S. DeMaere M.Z. Campbell T.J. Bauskin A.R. Tonini R. Mazzanti M. Breit S.N. Curmi P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9298-9305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Mapping of CLIC like channels from C. elegans has uncovered the importance of the N-terminal domain for targeting and insertion of the channel in the right membrane of action (18Berry K.L. Hobert O. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 1316-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The respective domain comprises a central α-helix flanked by two β-strands for proper targeting and possible membrane insertion. An alignment of the N-terminal part of AtDHAR1 with several members of the CLICs is shown in Fig. 1B. It reveals that At-DHRA-1 shares essential structural features with the other CLICs. Also in the case of the plant protein the predicted secondary structure is made up from a central α-helix and two flanking β-strands including a number of charges amino acids. Altogether a comparison between ATDHAR1 and other GSTs from Arabidopsis reveals that the former protein is more similar to most CLIC channels (25% identity to Hs_p64) than to many other Arabidopsis GSTs (11% identity to AtGSTF1). Hence, on the basis of simple sequence comparison, it may be anticipated that AtDHAR1 also functions as a channel. AtDHAR1 Is Not Only in the Soluble Phase—To examine the subcellular localization of AtDHAR1 we constructed a chimeric protein (AtDHAR1:GFP) in which GFP was N-terminally linked to AtDHAR1. The chimera was expressed in HEK293 and the distribution of AtDHAR1:GFP examined microscopically. The images revealed GFP fluorescence throughout the cell. Against this huge background it was not possible to identify a specific association of fluorescence with the plasma membrane (data not shown). We therefore also examined protein localization by Western blotting. For this purpose cells were fractionated in soluble proteins and proteins associated with the microsomal fraction. The blot in Fig. 2 shows that a GFP antibody recognizes, in cells transfected with GFP alone, one single band and only in the supernatant; the molecular mass of the band corresponds to that expected for this soluble protein (∼27 kDa). In cells transfected with the chimera the antibody labels two proteins: one (∼27 kDa) corresponds in size to GFP alone, a second larger protein corresponds well with the expected mass (50.5 kDa) of the chimera. Labeling of a protein of the size of GFP alone is unexpected in this preparation because GFP was expressed as fusion protein with AtDHAR1. The reason for this band cannot be fully explained but it is clear that it is not specific for the AtDHAR1 protein. Also expression ofaK+ channel in the same vector as a fusion protein with GFP in HEK293 cells resulted in the labeling of the chimera and of free GFP (15Moroni A. Viscomi C. Sangiorgio V. Pagliuca C. Meckel T. Horvath F. Gazzarrini S. Valbuzzi P. Van Etten L. DiFrancesco D. Thiel G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A reasonable explanation is that the presence of free GFP is due to protein degradation; a scrutiny of the short linker between the channel protein and the downstream GFP with the analysis software PeptideCutter shows that it contains potential cutting sizes for proteases. The large protein runs at a molecular mass of ∼50 kDa and hence corresponds well with the expected mass (50.5 kDa) of the chimera. This putative AtDHAR1:GFP chimera is most pronounced in the soluble extract but is also visible in the pellet. This result can be interpreted as evidence for the dual localization of AtDHAR1: other than the cytosolic GFP the chimera is present in the soluble phase of the cell and at lower abundance also in a membrane environment. Expression of AtDHAR1 in HEK293 Cells Causes an Enhanced Plasma Membrane Conductance—To examine the possibility that AtDHAR1 functions as an ion channel we expressed AtDHAR1:GFP in HEK293 cells. Alternatively the protein was also expressed using a bi-cistronic vector with GFP. Channel currents across the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells were measured in medium sized cell-attached patches (∼4MΩ) on green fluorescing cells transfected with AtDHAR1:GFP. For control currents were recorded in mock-transfected HEK293 cells expressing GFP only. The cell-attached configuration was chosen to maintain the cytoplasmic integrity and maintain the redox environment of cells. The patch-pipette contained tetraetylammonium TEA-Cl as the main electrolyte to bias the recording of anion currents and to inhibit endogenous K+ conductances. Fig. 3A shows typical currents recorded from a control cell (mock-transfected with GFP only). Voltage steps from the holding voltage of 0 mV to a range of test voltages between ± 125 mV elicited small current responses with a quasi-linear current/voltage (I/V) relationship (Fig. 3, C and D). In ∼70% of the patches recorded on the plasma membrane of GFP-positive cells transfected with AtDHAR1:GFP we observed a much higher conductance. Fig. 3B shows an example of a HEK293 cell expressing AtDHAR1:GFP. In response to the standard pulse protocol we measured a strong inward-rectifying conductance (Fig. 3C). Also the kinetics of the current responses was clearly different from that of endogenous currents. Negative voltage steps induced an instantaneous current on which a small and very slow activating component was superimposed. At positive voltages the instantaneous current was followed by a slow inactivation. Currents with similar kinetics and a similar current voltage relationship were recorded in 15 other patches on HEK293 cells transfected with AtDHAR1:GFP. The plot in Fig. 3D summarizes the mean currents at ±125 mV from AtDHAR1:GFP and control cells respectively. Similar currents were obtained when AtDHAR1 was expressed on a bicistronic vector without GFP directly fused to the protein (data not shown). This shows that the elevated conductance is entirely due to AtDHAR1 and that its properties are not altered by GFP fusion. The data suggest that the expression of AtDHAR1 results in an additional conductance with two kinetic components. To further examine the causal relation of the instantaneous (Ii) and the time-dependent component (Itd = steady state current (Ist) – Ii) we plotted Itd at –100 mV as a function of the corresponding Ii. The plot in Fig. 3E shows data from 16 patches on HEK293 cells expressing AtDHAR1:GFP; it reveals that the slow component is linearly correlated (r = 0.83) with Ii. The result of this analysis supports the view that Itd and Ii are conducted by the same channel; they probably reflect two different kinetic states of the same channel. AtDHAR1 Generates the Same Kind of Conductance in CHO Cells—Heterologous expression of ion channels generally bears the hazard that an increase in conductance in transfected cells is not due to the expressed protein but the consequence of an up-regulation of endogenous channels. To test whether the elevated conductance in AtDHAR1:GFP expressing HEK293 cells is an expression artefact, we performed the same experiments in CHO cells. Fig. 4A shows representative currents recorded from CHO cells transfected with AtDHAR1:GFP. Unlike mock-transfected cells, which have a very low, nearly linear background conductance (Fig. 4B), the AtDHAR1:GFP transfected cells show a high conductance (Fig. 4, A and B). The currents recorded in CHO cells share similar rectification and kinetics with those of HEK293 cells. The fact that two different cell lines transfected with AtDHAR1 show an elevated conductance with similar features supports the view that this protein itself functions as ion channel. Altogether these data show that the plant protein generates, very much like HsCLIC-1, a conductance in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. But unlike HsCLIC-1, which is outward rectifying (8Tonini R. Ferroni A. Valenzuela S.M. Warton K. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Mazzanti M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K. Bootcov M.R. Schofield P.R. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12575-12582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), the plant homolog generates an inward rectifying conductance. The different kinetic properties of HsCLIC-1 and AtDHAR1 in the same expression system (e.g. HEK293 cells) strongly supports the notion that the two different conductances are indeed related to the individual proteins and not to an expression artifact. The AtDHAR1-generated Conductance Can Also be Measured in the Whole Cell Configuration—In further experiments we also tested the possibility of recording the AtDHAR1-generated conductance in the whole cell configuration. Control HEK293 cells or AtDHAR1-expressing cells were therefore examined in a bath solution (14 mm TEA-Cl) in the whole cell configuration with 14 mm TEA-Cl in the pipette solution (see “Experimental Procedures”). The whole cell currents of the control cells revealed the low conductance and quasi-linear I/V relation observed in cell-attached recordings. An exemplary current response of a control cell to a step voltage protocol (holding voltage 0 mV, test voltages in –10 mV steps from +20 or +30 mV to –80 mV) is shown in Fig. 5A. Fig. 5E summarizes the data from 17 recordings in control HEK293 cells in the form of a mean I/V relation. Recordings obtained from GFP-positive cells transfected with AtDHAR1:GFP exhibited again in ∼65% of the cells tested currents, which were appreciably different from the control. Fig. 5B shows a representative example of current responses to a standard step voltage protocol in a transfected HEK293 cell. The current traces as well as the I/V relations from whole cell recordings are qualitatively similar with respect to rectification and kinetics to those obtained in the cell-attached configuration (Fig. 5, B and E, compare Fig. 3). To obtain information on the selectivity of the AtDHAR1-induced conductance, the same cell of Fig. 5B was also bather in a solution with either 140 mm TEA-Cl or 14 mm TEA acetate. The resulting currents are shown in Fig. 5, C and D. Comparison of the currents reveals that the overall conductance increases in response to a 10-fold rise in the concentration of extracellular TEA-Cl; an equimolar exchange of Cl– for acetate on the other hand results in a reduction of the overall conductance. To assess the selectivity of the conductance Ii was plotted as function of voltage; the plot in Fig. 5F shows that the currents reverse at about 0 mV irrespective of the bath composition. The same results were obtained from other experiments in which cells were recorded under the three conditions; the mean reversal voltages were as follows: +4 ± 4 mV (n = 8) with 14 mm TEA-Cl, +2 ± 3 mV (n = 8) for 140 mm TEA-Cl, and –1 ± 3 mV (n = 3) for 14 mm TEA acetate in the bath solution. To obtain a better resolution of the reversal voltage of the AtDHAR1-induced conductance, we also determined this voltage from tail currents. The same cell shown in Fig. 5C was clamped to a conditioning voltage of –100 mV to activate the time-dependent component; the tail currents were then obtained from the current deactivation at test voltages between +30 mV and –70 mV (Fig. 5G). After the decay of the capacitive transients small but resolvable tail currents were observed at the test voltages (inset in Fig. 5G). A plot of the tail currents as a function of voltage and interpolation of the data points shows that this procedure again provides a reversal voltage close to 0 mV (mean –3 ± 5 mV, n = 4). The same procedure was repeated with 14 mm TEA acetate in the bath medium. Also under this condition the tail currents reverse at about 0 mV (–3 ± 3 mV, n = 3). Notably for an anion-selective channel a reversal voltage of about +60 mV would have been expected for the 10-fold difference in the concentration of Cl– between the internal and external solution. Also if AtDHAR1 was generating an anion selective conductance the replacement of Cl– for acetate should have shifted the reversal voltage. Instead a reversal voltages at about 0 mV for all three conditions implies that the AtDHAR1-induced conductance is not selective. Because the membrane voltage in whole cell recordings is better defined than in cell-attached measurements we used the former configuration for a more extensive characterization of the AtDHAR1-induced conductance. The current responses in Fig. 6 show that the time-dependent component of the AtDHAR1 related current develops in a voltage- and time-dependent manner. To estimate the voltage dependence of the process we determined its activation curve. For this purpose we collected the current response from the recording in Fig. 6 immediately after stepping from the test voltages to the post voltage at +10 mV. Fig. 6B illustrates the resulting currents as a function of the conditioning voltage. The data can be fitted by the following Boltzmann equation,It,10mv=(Imax-Ii)/[1+exp((V-V0.5)/ds)](Eq.1) where It,10 mV is fractional tail current at 10 mV, Imax is the maximal tail current at 10 mV, and Ii is the time-independent current at this voltage. V is voltage, V0.5 is the half-activation voltage, and ds the inverse-slope coefficient. The fit yields a voltage for half-maximal activation of the conductance at –14 mV (mean –16 ± 6 mV, n = 4) and a steepness of (–28 ± 6 mV, n = 4). The amplitudes of the fit reveal that the voltage-dependent fraction of the tail current is 41% of the total current. Similar values were obtained from three other recordings giving a mean fraction of 38 ± 7% of the voltage- and time-dependent fraction of the total AtDHAR1-induced conductance. While the recordings in cell-attached and whole cell configuration show strong similarity in kinetics and voltage dependence, they clearly differ in the current densities. The resistance of the electrodes used for the cell-attached patches was in the range of 4 MΩ, which suggests that the membrane area of the patches is about 2–3 μm2 (20Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-channel Recording. Plenum Press, New York1985: 37-51Google Scholar). Comparison of the steady state data from both configurations shows that the current amplitudes are only about 10 times higher in the whole cell configuration than in the cell-attached configuration. This value is much less than the ratio between the patch and the whole cell area. A conservative estimate suggests that these two areas differ by at least a factor of 1000. The reason for the difference in current density in the two configurations is not known. But it is possible to speculate that cytoplasmic factors, which are inevitably lost or modified during perfusion of the cytoplasm in the whole cell recordings (21Pusch M. Neher E. Pfluegers Arch. 1988; 411: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), are responsible for the relative lower conductance in the whole cell configuration. The present experiments show that a plant protein from the GST superfamily is homologous to members of the channel-forming animal CLICs. As for the CLICs also the plant protein frequently promotes membrane conductance when expressed in heterologous systems. From the data it is not entirely clear whether the protein has by itself channel-forming activity. Because of the multiple functions found in association with animal CLICs it cannot be excluded that the increase in AtDHAR1-generated conductance is of secondary nature. In analogy to animal CLICs the present data could also be interpreted in the context of a CLIC-mediated release of intracellular Ca2+ (22Dulhunty A. Gage P. Curtis S. Chelvanayagam G. Board P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3319-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) or in the context of AtDHAR1 binding to the cortical actin cytoskeleton (23Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24Berryman M. Bruno J. Price J. Edwards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3494-34801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Suginta W. Karoulias N. Aitken A. Ashley R.H. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Nonetheless the present findings support the view of a direct channel function of AtDHAR1: the conductance induced by AtDAHR1 has similar kinetic and rectification in HEK293 cells as in CHO cells. A regulation of endogenous channels would have been expected to result in different currents depending on the difference of endogenous currents in the two cell types. Worth noting is that the respective conductance has not been observed in all cells expressing AtDHAR1. The reason for this result is not clear. But a reasonable explanation for the failure of recording a AtDHAR1-induced conductance in some cells is that the respective conductance behaves to a large extend like an ohmic resistor with only a few kinetic features. Such a conductance is easily overseen on the background of the leak conductance in case that the number of the protein in the membrane is low. Other than expected from the similarity to animal CLICs, the AtDHAR1 protein does not result in an anion-selective conductance but in a non-selective conductance. The discrepancy in selectivity might be related to structural differences in the proposed pore region between the proteins (17Harrop S.J. DeMaere M.Z. Fairlie W.D. Reztsova T. Valenzuela S.M. Mazzanti M. Tonini R. Qiu M.R. Jankova L. Warton K. Bauskin A.R. Wu W.M. Pankhurst S. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Curmi P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44993-50000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, recent data from planar lipid bilayer studies show that anion/cation selectivity of CLIC1 from human is only moderate (10Singh H. Ashley R.H. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 1628-1638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Hence anion selectivity may not be obligatory for CLICs. Assuming that At-DHAR1 is indeed a channel, the present findings have implications for the understanding of CLIC evolution. Currently it is not clear whether CLICs and GSTs originate from a common ancestor. Theoretical considerations already argued for such a common ancestor on the basis of structural motives, which are shared by all members of the GST superfamily (4Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Eur. Biophys. J. 2002; 31: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic relation between the plant At-DHARs with the CLICs and the apparent channel activity of At-DHAR strongly suggests a common ancestor of the proteins. The plant protein with its dual function, i.e. dehydroascorbate reduction (3Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and channel function, might be a primordial version of the protein. The animal proteins may have further specialized to either selectively conduct currents or act as dehydroascorbate reductase. It is notable that the animal omega class GST, GSTO 1-1, which shares structural similarity with AtDHAR1 does not exhibit channel-forming activity (22Dulhunty A. Gage P. Curtis S. Chelvanayagam G. Board P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3319-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). At present our information does not provide any direct information on the relevance of an At-DHAR1-related conductance in the physiology of plants. Some interesting information however occurs from the analysis of Arabidopsis micro-array data. These data reveal that the protein is abundantly expressed in most organs of Arabidopsis; its expression is increased by stress, but osmotic and salt stresses are more effective than UV-light or oxidative stresses. Such a behavior would be more consistent with a function of the protein as a channel rather than a GST. We thank Michele Mazzanti (Rome, Italy) and Paul Curmi (Sydney, Australia) for many valuable suggestions on the project. We are especially grateful to Ralf Kaldenhoff (Darmstadt, Germany) for his help to continue the project."
https://openalex.org/W2170471724,"NO, the product of endothelial NOS (eNOS), is a major regulator of vascular homeostasis and a critical factor in preventing cardiovascular diseases. We previously established a positive correlation between the number of variable CA repeats in intron 13 of human eNOS and the risk of coronary artery disease, and demonstrated that these polymorphic CA repeats function as a length-dependent splicing enhancer. By 5'-RACE polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we detected three splice variants containing novel 3' splice sites within intron 13--termed eNOS13A, eNOS13B, and eNOS13C--which share the first 13 exons of human eNOS and the same polyadenylation site at the end of the novel exon. When translated, all these splice variants would result in truncated proteins lacking eNOS activity. Coexpression of full-length eNOS with eNOS13A diminished eNOS enzyme activity in COS-7 cells by formation of heterodimers. The splice variants were expressed in endothelial cells and various human tissues. Finally, we demonstrate, using minigene transfection, that the expression of the eNOS13A splice variant is increased with high CA repeat numbers in intron 13. These data suggest a new mechanism for the regulation of eNOS activity and NO production in the cardiovascular system by truncated, dominant-negative splice variants of human eNOS."
https://openalex.org/W2108139257,"Insulin exerts pleiotropic effects at the cellular level. Signaling via the two isoforms of the insulin receptor (IR) may explain the activation of different signaling cascades, while it remains to be explored how selectivity is achieved when utilizing the same IR isoform. We now demonstrate that insulin-stimulated transcription of c-fos and glucokinase genes is activated simultaneously in the insulin-producing beta-cell via IR-B localized in different cellular compartments. Insulin activates the glucokinase gene from plasma membrane-standing IR-B, while c-fos gene activation is dependent on clathrin-mediated IR-B-endocytosis and signaling from early endosomes. Moreover, glucokinase gene up-regulation requires the integrity of the juxtamembrane IR-B NPEY-motif and signaling via PI3K-C2alpha-like/PDK1/PKB, while c-fos gene activation requires the intact C-terminal YTHM-motif and signaling via PI3K Ia/Shc/MEK1/ERK. By using IR-B as an example it is thus possible to demonstrate how spatial segregation allows simultaneous and selective signaling via the same receptor isoform in the same cell."

Early studies on the development of the visual perception of biological motion showed that infants after three months of age distinguished between biological and non-biological locomotion.Using single point-light motions that varied with respect to the ""two-third-power law"" of motion generation and perception, we observed that four-day-old human neonates looked longer at non-biological motions than at biological motions when these were simultaneously presented in a standard preferential looking paradigm.This result can be interpreted within the ""violation of expectation"" framework and can indicate that neonates' motion perception - like adults'-is attuned to biological kinematics."
https://openalex.org/W2091458025,"Background The role of circulating levels of total homocysteine tHcy in the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) is still under debate. One reason for conflicting results between previous studies on homocysteine and heart diseases could be consequence of different interactions between homocysteine and genes in different study populations. Many genetic factors play a role in folate-homocysteine metabolism, like functional polymorphism (Val108Met) in the Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene. Methodology and Findings Our aim was to examine the role of COMT Val158Met polymorphism and interaction of this polymorphism with serum tHcy and folate concentration on the risk of acute coronary and events in middle-aged men from eastern Finland. A population-based prospective cohort of 792 men aged 46–64 years was examined as part of the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study. During an average follow-up of 9.3 years, there were 69 acute coronary events in men with no previous history of CHD. When comparing the COMT low activity genotype with the others, we found an age and examination year adjusted hazard rate ratio (HRR) of 1.73 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07–2.79), and an age, examination year, serum LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride concentration, systolic blood pressure and smoking adjusted HRR of 1.77 (95% CI, 1.05–2.77). Although serum tHcy concentration was not statistically significantly associated with acute coronary events (HRR for the highest third versus others 1.52, 95% CI, 0.93–2.49), subjects with both high serum tHcy and the COMT low activity genotype had an additionally increased adjusted risk of HRR 2.94 (95% CI 1.50–5.76) as compared with other men. Conclusions This prospective cohort study suggests that the functional COMT Val158Met polymorphism is associated with increased risk of acute coronary events and it may interact with high serum tHcy levels."

In the current report, we identified Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) as a functional HIMF binding partner through glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HIMF pull-down studies and mass spectrometry. Using primary cultured HIMF-stimulated murine bone marrow cells, we demonstrated that HIMF causes redistribution of BTK to the leading edge of the cells. HIMF stimulation induced BTK autophosphorylation, which peaked at 2.5 min. A transwell migration assay showed that treatment with recombinant murine HIMF induced migration of primary cultured bone marrow cells that was completely blocked by the BTK inhibitor, LFM-A13. Our results demonstrate BTK as the first known functional binding partner of the HIMF/FIZZ family of proteins and that HIMF acts as a chemotatic molecule in stimulating the migration of myeloid cells through activation of the BTK pathway."

We evaluated whether an ELISPOT test could identify tuberculosis (TB) contacts with boosting of immunity to non-tuberculous mycobacterial exposure.We conducted tuberculin and ELISPOT tests in 1665 TB contacts: 799 were tuberculin test negative and were offered a repeat test after three months. Those with tuberculin test conversion had an ELISPOT, chest X-ray and sputum analysis if appropriate. We compared converters with non-converters, assessed the probability of each of four combinations of ELISPOT results over the two time points and estimated boosting with adjustment for ELISPOT sensitivity and specificity. 704 (72%) contacts had a repeat tuberculin test; 176 (25%) had test conversion, which increased with exposure to a case (p = 0.002), increasing age (p = 0.0006) and BCG scar (p = 0.06). 114 tuberculin test converters had ELISPOT results: 16(14%) were recruitment positive/follow-up positive, 9 (8%) positive/negative, 34 (30%) negative/positive, and 55 (48%) were negative/negative. There was a significant non-linear effect of age for ELISPOT results in skin test converters (p = 0.038). Estimates of boosting ranged from 32%-41% of skin test converters with increasing age. Three converters were diagnosed with TB, two had ELISPOT results: both were positive, including one at recruitment.We estimate that approximately one third of tuberculin skin test conversion in Gambian TB case contacts is due to boosting of immunity to non-tuberculous mycobacterial exposure. Further longitudinal studies are required to confirm whether ELISPOT can reliably identify case contacts with tuberculin test conversion that would benefit most from prophylactic treatment."

The quinone bound at the high-affinity site appears to function as a tightly bound cofactor, similar to the QA site of the reaction centers. Rapid kinetic studies show that the quinone bound at the QH site is important for rapid reduction of heme b but not for rapid electron transfer from heme b to the heme o3/CuB binuclear center (11Kobayashi K.

No EPR signal was observed for the H98F and R71H mutants. A SQ signal was detected in the same potential range as that of the wild type enzyme for the D75H mutant. However, the EPR spectrum of the D75H mutant lacks the characteristic hyperfine structure, indicating a significant change in the hydrogen bonding of the SQ. For the I102W mutant, a radical signal was seen with a redox midpoint potential downshifted by about 200 mV. On the basis of these observations it was suggested that Arg-71, Asp-75, and His-98 are involved in the stabilization of the SQ in the QH site. The interaction of the SQ with the protein environment in cytochrome bo3 has been characterized by pulsed EPR spectroscopy. ESEEM data show that there is one H-bond to the QH SQ from a nitrogen atom of the side chain of an arginine or glutamine (5Grimaldi S. MacMillan F. Ostermann T. Ludwig B. Michel H. Prisner T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6Grimaldi S. Ostermann T. Weiden N. Mogi T. Miyoshi H. Ludwig B. Michel H. Prisner T. MacMillan F.

Further information was obtained from two-dimensional ESEEM (14Yap L.L. Samoilova R.I. Gennis R.B. Dikanov S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16879-16887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in conjunction with 1H2O and 2H2O exchange, indicating at least three exchangeable protons. Two of the protons possess large anisotropic hyperfine couplings (∼4 and 6 MHz), and were assigned to the protons interacting with carbonyl oxygens. The ENDOR and two-dimensional ESEEM spectra were also used to determine that the isotropic hyperfine constant with the non-exchangeable methyl protons of the SQ in cytochrome bo3 is ∼10–11 MHz (14Yap L.L.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 5638-5645Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This value is about twice the coupling for UQ anion radicals in solution. This large hyperfine coupling, along with the value of the anisotropic hyperfine coupling of ∼6 MHz for one exchangeable proton, are consistent with the SQ being a neutral radical, protonated at carbonyl oxygen O-1, rather than an anion radical (14Yap L.L. Samoilova R.I. Gennis R.B. Dikanov S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16879-16887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The exchangeable proton with 4 MHz coupling could be a proton shared either between quinone carbonyl O-1 and a nitrogen-containing group of Arg-71 or between carbonyl O-4 and the NH2 group of Gln-101 (see Fig. 1). The current work is motivated by the previous observation that the D75H mutant is virtually inactive, but the midpoint potential and stability of the SQ bound at the QH site are virtually unchanged (2Hellwig P. Yano T. Ohnishi T. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10675-10679Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The loss of activity due to the D75H mutation correlates with a change in the line shape of the EPR spectrum of the SQ. The change in line shape implies an altered environment around the SQ. The specific nature of the changes of the SQ environment is explored in the current work by the application of high resolution EPR spectroscopy. The major finding is that the D75H mutation results in stabilizing the anionic form of the SQ at the QH site, which correlates with the loss of enzyme activity. Sample Preparation—The cyoABCDE operon encoding cytochrome bo3 with a His6 tag at the C terminus end of subunit II was cloned into the pET-17b vector (Novagen). The D75H and D75E mutants were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, and the primers were synthesized by Bio-Synthesis (Bio-Synthesis, Inc.). The mutations were verified by partial sequencing of the gene. The mutant proteins were expressed in the C43(DE3) E. coli strain (Avidis, France) in which cyoBCD was deleted. Overexpression of the mutant proteins was achieved by induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C. Harvested cells were resuspended in 50 mm K2HPO4, 5 mm MgSO4, pH 8.3, and broken by passing through a microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corp.) at 10,000 p.s.i. for a total of 3 times. The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min to remove cell debris. Membranes were then isolated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 180,000 × g for 5 h. The isolated membranes were suspended in 50 mm K2HPO4, pH 8.3, and solubilized with 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (Anatrace) by stirring at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 1 h to remove unsolubilized material. The solubilized enzyme was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column and purified as described previously (17Rumbley J.N. Nickels E.F. Gennis R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1340: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The purified protein was dialyzed in 50 mm K2HPO4, 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, pH 8.3, and concentrated to ∼600 μm. For the deuterated sample, the dialyzed protein was concentrated, exchanged with deuterated 50 mm K2HPO4, 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, pD 8.3, and then further concentrated to ∼600 μm. The enzyme was anaerobically reduced under an argon atmosphere with 500 times excess sodium ascorbate. The reduced sample was quickly transferred to an argon-flushed EPR tube and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. EPR Measurements—The CW EPR measurements were performed on an X-band Varian EPR-E122 spectrometer at 100 K. The pulsed EPR experiments were carried out using an X-band Bruker ELEXSYS E580 spectrometer equipped with Oxford CF 935 cryostats. Unless otherwise indicated, all measurements were made at 50 K. Some pulsed EPR measurements were also performed at higher temperatures, up to 120 K, and the results were similar to those obtained at 50 K. Several types of ESE experiments with different pulse sequences were employed with appropriate phase cycling schemes to eliminate unwanted features from the experimental echo envelopes. Among them are one-dimensional and two-dimensional three-pulse and four-pulse sequences, which are described in detail elsewhere (14Yap L.L. Samoilova R.I. Gennis R.B. Dikanov S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16879-16887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Spectral processing of three- and four-pulse ESEEM patterns, including subtraction of relaxation decay (fitting by 3–4 degree polynomials), apodization (Hamming window), zero feeling, and fast Fourier transformation, was performed using Bruker WIN-EPR software. Pulsed ENDOR spectra of the radicals were obtained using Davies and Mims sequences with different pulse lengths. The specifics of these experiments are described in detail elsewhere (19Schweiger A. Jeschke G. Principles of Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance. Oxford University Press, Oxford2001: 359-405Google Scholar). Characteristics of HYSCORE Spectra from I = ½ Nuclei—The most informative experimental data regarding the ligand environment of the semiquinone were obtained from the two-dimensional ESEEM (HYSCORE) experiment (18Höfer P. Grupp A. Nebenführ H. Mehring M.M. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1986; 132: 279-284Crossref Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The basic advantage of the HYSCORE technique is the creation of two-dimensional spectra with off-diagonal cross-peaks (να, νβ) and (νβ, να), whose coordinates are nuclear frequencies from opposite electron spin manifolds. Orientationally disordered (i.e. powder) two-dimensional spectra of I = ½ nuclei also reveal, in the form of cross-peak contour projections, the interdependence between να and νβ values in the same orientation. Analysis of the contours allows for direct, simultaneous determination of the nuclear isotropic and anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants (20Dikanov S.A. Bowman M.K. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1995; 116: 125-128Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The “Cancellation Condition” in 14N ESEEM Spectra—Because of the I = 1 spin, and the quadrupole interactions resulting from this, the 14N nucleus can produce up to six lines in an ESEEM spectrum, three from each of the two electron spin manifolds with mS =+½ or –½. In measurements of amorphous (powder) samples, such as the frozen suspensions of cytochrome bo3 used in this work, because of their different orientation dependence, not all transitions contribute equally to the spectra. The type of spectrum expected from 14N with predominantly isotropic hyperfine coupling A is governed by the ratio between the effective nuclear frequency in each manifold, νef±, given by νef± = |νN ± |A|/2| (νN is the Zeeman frequency of 14N), and the quadrupole coupling constant, K, given by K = e2qQ/4h (21Dikanov S.A. Tsvetkov Y.D. Bowman M.K. Astashkin A.V. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1982; 90: 149-153Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Flanagan H. Singel D.J. J. Chem. Phys. 1987; 87: 5606-5616Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). If νef±/K ∼ 0, i.e. νef± ≅ 0 (the situation called a cancellation condition because νN ≅ A/2) then the three nuclear frequencies from a corresponding manifold will be close to the three pure (or zero field) nuclear quadrupole resonance frequencies of 14N. In this case, three narrow peaks at the frequencies ν+, ν–, and νo will appear in the powder ESEEM spectra, with the property ν+ = ν– + ν0.v+=K(3+η);v-=K(3-η);v0=2Kη(Eq.1) The frequencies, described by Equation 1 can appear in spectra up to a ratio of νef±/K ∼ 0.75–1, but are broadened as this value departs from 0 (21Dikanov S.A. Tsvetkov Y.D. Bowman M.K. Astashkin A.V. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1982; 90: 149-153Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Flanagan H. Singel D.J. J. Chem. Phys. 1987; 87: 5606-5616Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The term η is an asymmetry parameter. If νef±/K > 1, only a single line is expected from each corresponding manifold without any pronounced orientation dependence. This line is produced by a transition at the maximum frequency, which is actually a double-quantum transition between the two outer states with mI =–1 and +1. The frequency of this transition is well described by Equation 2,vdq±=2[vef±2+κ]1/2(Eq.2) where κ = K2(3 + η2) (21Dikanov S.A. Tsvetkov Y.D. Bowman M.K. Astashkin A.V. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1982; 90: 149-153Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Two other single-quantum transitions, involving the central level with mI = 0, have a significant orientation dependence from quadrupole interaction and could produce lines at varying frequencies in the orientation-selected spectra. Thus, the three-pulse ESEEM spectrum near the cancellation condition will consist of four lines, i.e. three narrow lines at zero-field nuclear quadrupole resonance frequencies, described by Equation 1, from manifold with νef ∼ 0, and one double-quantum transition from the opposite manifold described by Equation 2. EPR Spectra—Fig. 2 shows the X-band EPR spectra of the semiquinone in the wild type cytochrome bo3, along with the D75E and D75H mutants. The SQ spectra all display a single line with similar g value about 2.0047 ± 0.0001. The difference between the spectra is in the weakly resolved hyperfine structure due to coupling with the methyl protons (6Grimaldi S. Ostermann T. Weiden N. Mogi T. Miyoshi H. Ludwig B. Michel H. Prisner T. MacMillan F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5632-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Veselov A.V. Osborne J.P. Gennis R.B. Scholes C.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3169-3175Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The hyperfine structure, which is readily seen in the spectrum of wild type protein, is also present in the spectrum of D75E mutant oxidase, but it is absent in the spectrum from D75H. Nitrogens Detected by ESEEM in Wild Type Protein and Mutants—Fig. 3 shows the stacked plots of the three-pulse ESEEM spectra at frequencies <10 MHz, appropriate for 14N nuclei, recorded as a function of time, τ, between the first and second pulses at the maximum of the EPR intensity for the SQ in the wild type, D75E, and D75H oxidases. Each spectrum exhibits three-intensive narrow lines ν0, ν–, and ν+ with a property ν0 + ν– = ν+. There is also a less intensive and broader line at frequency νdq (21Dikanov S.A. Tsvetkov Y.D. Bowman M.K. Astashkin A.V. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1982; 90: 149-153Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Flanagan H. Singel D.J. J. Chem. Phys. 1987; 87: 5606-5616Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These spectra have a shape typical for a single 14N recorded near cancellation conditions, and allows for an immediate assignment of the narrow peaks to three nuclear quadrupole resonance frequencies (see Equation 1), and for the frequency of the double-quantum transition νdq (see Equation 2). This assignment was confirmed by the 14N HYSCORE spectra. These spectra (Fig. S1 in supplementary materials) exhibit cross-peaks correlating ν0, ν–, and ν+ with νdq, thus indicating that they belong to different manifolds. They also allow determining more precisely the value of the νdq frequency from the (νdq, ν+) cross-correlation possessing maximum intensity. Having obtained the frequencies for ν0, ν–, ν+, and νdq, Equations 1 and 2 along with the 14N Zeeman frequency (νN = 1.065 MHz) were used to determine the quadrupole coupling constant K, the asymmetry parameter η, and the hyperfine coupling A with the nitrogen nuclei. Their values for three proteins are collected in Table 1. Thus, the SQ in the wild type, D75H, and D75E mutant oxidases each interacts only with a single nitrogen carrying significant, presumably isotropic hyperfine coupling resulting from the transfer of the unpaired spin density from the SQ via the hydrogen bond bridge. The values of K and η characterize the chemical type of 14N nucleus interacting with the SQ.TABLE 114N ESEEM frequencies in wild type cytochrome bo3, D75E, and D75H mutants, and nuclear quadrupole and hyperfine parametersProteinν0ν-ν+νdqKηAMHzaAn accuracy in the determination of the nqr frequencies ±0.03 MHz.MHzMHzWild type0.952.323.275.1-5.20.930.511.8D75E0.902.413.315.1-5.20.950.471.9D75H0.630.981.615.0-5.10.430.732.7a An accuracy in the determination of the nqr frequencies ±0.03 MHz. Open table in a new tab The characteristics of the nitrogen in the D75E mutant is only slightly changed compared with that observed in the wild type oxidase, indicating that the same nitrogen, previously assigned to either the Arg-71 or Gln-101 side chain in the wild type enzyme (14Yap L.L. Samoilova R.I. Gennis R.B. Dikanov S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16879-16887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), is also hydrogen bonded to the SQ in the D75E mutant. In contrast, the quadrupole coupling constant of the nitrogen in the D75H mutant is more than two times smaller than that of the nitrogen in the wild type oxidase, showing that the nitrogen H-bonded to the SQ in the D75H mutant is from a different chemical group. Hence, the hydrogen bond of the SQ to Arg-71 or Gln-101 that is present in the wild type enzyme is broken (or significantly weakened) in the D75H mutant, and is replaced by a strong hydrogen bond to different nitrogen. Additional information about the H-bonds in these proteins was obtained from the study of the proton environment of the SQ. Proton HYSCORE and ESEEM—Fig. 4 shows the proton part of the HYSCORE spectra (τ = 136 ns) of the SQ radical in the D75E and D75H samples prepared in 1H2O and 2H2O buffer. The spectrum of wild type cytochrome bo3 has been discussed previously (14Yap L.L. Samoilova R.I. Gennis R.B. Dikanov S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16879-16887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and is shown for convenience in supplementary materials Fig. S2. In addition to a diagonal peak with extended shoulders at the proton Zeeman frequency (νH ∼ 14.7 MHz), the spectra of the D75E and D75H samples in 1H2O (Fig. 4) contain several pairs of resolved cross-peaks located symmetrically relative to the diagonal. Among those, only cross-peaks with maximal splitting (1) and the diagonal peak, with its shoulders, still appear in the spectra obtained under the same conditions using the samples with 2H2O. All other cross-peaks 2–4 completely disappear in these spectra, showing that these are produced by exchangeable protons. One obvious difference between the spectra from the D75E and D75H mutants is that in the D75E spectrum, the nonexchangeable cross-peaks (1) produced by the methyl protons (14Yap L.L. Samoilova R.I.

Chem. 2006; 281: 16879-16887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) are well separated from the cross-peaks of the exchangeable protons, whereas in the D75H spectrum, these cross-peaks are overlapped due to smaller coupling with methyl protons. The wild type spectrum is similar to that from D75E in this respect. Quantitative analysis of the cross-peak contour line shapes and simulations of the spectra, described in detail in Ref. 14Yap L.L.

Cross-peaks 4 belong to different proton(s). The analysis provides also the isotropic (a) and anisotropic (T) components of the axial hyperfine tensors, which are summarized in Table 2 for nonexchangeable methyl protons and in Table 3 for exchangeable protons.TABLE 2Hyperfine tensors of the methyl protons (MHz) derived from HYSCORE spectraProteinaTA⊥ = a — TA| = a + 2TWild-typeaFrom Ref. 14.10.01.78.313.4D75E9.21.47.812.0D75H8.00.87.29.6a From Ref. 14Yap L.L.

Open table in a new tab Additional information about the exchangeable protons was obtained from the sum combination peaks in the one-dimensional four-pulse ESEEM spectra, which are particularly useful for the observation of proton sum combination lines with improved resolution (23Reijerse E.J. Dikanov S.A. J. Chem. Phys. 1991; 95: 836-845Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The four-pulse ESEEM spectrum of the SQ in wild type cytochrome bo3 in 1H2O buffer contains three well resolved lines in the region of the proton 2νH as shown in Fig. 5. The most intense line appears exactly at the 2νH frequency and represents the contribution of weakly coupled protons from the protein environment. The four-pulse spectrum also reveals two peaks of lower intensity (H2 and H3) shifted from 2νH to higher frequencies by ∼0.7 and ∼1.4 MHz. These two shifted lines completely disappear in the spectra of the sample prepared in 2H2O. From this, one can conclude that the shifted lines also contain a major contribution from exchangeable protons. The shifts observed in the four-pulse ESEEM are well described by Equation 3,Δ=9T2/16vH(Eq.3) from which the anisotropic component T can be estimated (23Reijerse E.J. Dikanov S.A. J. Chem. Phys. 1991; 95: 836-845Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The shifts of ∼0.7 and ∼1.4 MHz correspond to T = 4.2 and 6.0 MHz (Table 4), which are consistent with the T values determined for two exchangeable protons with largest hyperfine couplings from HYSCORE spectra (14Yap L.L.

All other protons from the SQ and its environment possess smaller hyperfine couplings, which do not give resolvable shifts.TABLE 4The shifts of the sum-combination line from exchangeable protons and the corresponding anisotropic couplingsProteinProtonShiftTMHzWild-typeH21.46.0H30.74.2D75EH20.754.5H3Up to 0.9-1.0∼5.0D75HH20.84.6 Open table in a new tab In contrast to the wild type protein, the four-pulse ESEEM spectrum of the D75E mutant shows a single shifted peak of asymmetrical form with a shoulder at the high frequency side.

https://openalex.org/W2132742411,"DsbB is an integral membrane protein responsible for the de novo synthesis of disulfide bonds in Escherichia coli and many other prokaryotes. In the process of transferring electrons from DsbA to a tightly bound ubiquinone cofactor, DsbB undergoes an unusual spectral transition at ∼510 nm. We have utilized this spectral transition to study the kinetic cycle of DsbB in detail using stopped flow methods. We show that upon mixing of Dsb-Box and DsbAred, there is a rapid increase in absorbance at 510 nm (giving rise to a purple solution), followed by two slower decay phases. The rate of the initial phase is highly dependent upon DsbA concentration (k1 ∼5 × 105 m–1 s–1), suggesting this phase reflects the rate of DsbA binding. The rates of the subsequent decay phases are independent of DsbA concentration (k2 ∼ 2 s–1; k3 ∼ 0.3 s–1), indicative of intramolecular reaction steps. Absorbance measurements at 275 nm suggest that k2 and k3 are associated with steps of quinone reduction. The rate of DsbA oxidation was found to be the same as the rate of quinone reduction, suggestive of a highly concerted reaction. The concerted nature of the reaction may explain why previous efforts to dissect the reaction mechanism of DsbB by examining individual pairs of cysteines yielded seemingly paradoxical results. Order of mixing experiments showed that the quinone must be pre-bound to DsbB to observe the purple intermediate as well as for efficient quinone reduction. These results are consistent with a kinetic model for DsbB action in which DsbA binding is followed by a rapid disulfide exchange event.

This is followed by quinone reduction, which is rate-limiting in the overall reaction cycle. Disulfide bonds are post-translational modifications that play vital roles in the folding, stability, and activity of numerous secreted proteins. In the Escherichia coli periplasm, disulfide bond formation is catalyzed by the DsbA/DsbB system (for reviews see Refs. 1Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar and 2Nakamoto H. Bardwell J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). DsbA donates its disulfide bond directly to substrate proteins (3Frech C. Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 4Zapun A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5202-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and to remain catalytically active, DsbA must be reoxidized by an electron acceptor. This role is filled by the enzyme DsbB, which catalyzes the de novo formation of disulfide bonds using the oxidizing power of a bound ubiquinone cofactor, which in turn links disulfide bond formation to the electron transport chain (5Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 6Bader M. Muse W. Zander T. Bardwell J. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 11857-11862Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although disulfide exchange reactions have been well studied in many systems, much less is known about how they are formed de novo. Because DsbB is the primary source of disulfides in the cell, it is of great interest to elucidate its catalytic mechanism. In the process of transferring electrons from DsbA to ubiquinone, DsbB undergoes a spectral transition to a purple species (λmax ∼ 510 nm). This was first suggested to be due to the formation of a quinhydrone, a stacked ring system consisting of one oxidized and one reduced quinone molecule (10Regeimbal J. Gleiter S. Trumpower B.L. Yu C.A. Diwakar M. Ballou D.P. Bardwell J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13779-13784Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). More recent studies support an alternative explanation in which the Cys44 thiolate of DsbB is involved in a charge transfer complex with a DsbB-bound ubiquinone (11Inaba K. Takahashi Y.H. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Inaba K. Takahashi Y.H. Ito K. Hayashi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This was supported by the observation that in a DsbB mutant, which only contains only one cysteine (Cys44), a stable purple color is observed. This purple color is independent of DsbA, but it requires quinone. Although the purple intermediate of DsbB is associated with a free Cys44, it is likely that subsequent steps of the reaction, namely the regeneration of an oxidized ubiquinone on DsbB, involve a quinhydrone-like complex. An intriguing and controversial aspect of the DsbA/DsbB system is the paradoxical redox potentials of the components involved. DsbA contains the most oxidizing disulfide known, with a standard redox potential of –122 mV (13Zapun A. Bardwell J.C. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). DsbB contains two essential cysteine pairs, both of which have standard redox potentials that are substantially more reducing than that of DsbA according to most published reports. The Cys104– Cys130 pair of DsbB has been shown to react initially with DsbA (14Guilhot C. Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9895-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Kishigami S. Ito K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Kishigami S. Kanaya E. Kikuchi M. Ito K. J. Biol.

Fritz A. Glockshuber R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Inaba K.

Reported redox potentials for the Cys41–Cys44 pair, which is close to the quinone-binding site (21Xie T. Yu L. Bader M.W. Bardwell J.C. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1649-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), are extremely variable, from –69 mV (17Grauschopf U. Fritz A. Glockshuber R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) to –271 mV (20Regeimbal J. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32706-32713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), with a few intermediate values (–207 and –210 mV) reported as well (18Inaba K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Inaba K. Takahashi Y.H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33035-33044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Ubiquinone in solution has a redox potential of +113 mV (22Gennis R.B. Stewart V. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 222Google Scholar). The midpoint potential for ubiquinone in mitochondrial membranes is reported to be +65 mV (23Urban P.F. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although the redox potential of DsbB-bound ubiquinone has not been determined, it is expected to be substantially more oxidizing than DsbA, and is thus thought to drive the reaction toward the oxidation of DsbA despite the apparent uphill redox gradient through DsbB. The hydroquinone produced by DsbB is also readily reoxidized by the electron transport chain and O2, further driving the reaction. The recently solved crystal structure of a DsbB-DsbA complex has shed some light on the reaction mechanism of DsbB (24Inaba K. Murakami S. Suzuki M. Nakagawa A. Yamashita E. Okada K. Ito K. Cell. 2006; 127: 789-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This structure revealed four transmembrane helices that surround the bound ubiquinone cofactor. The head group of the quinone is positioned near the periplasmic membrane interface and is slightly solvent-exposed, whereas the isoprenoid tail, although invisible in the structure, is predicted to project down into the center of the membrane. Most notably, it was observed that Cys104, which is located in a mobile periplasmic loop of DsbB, becomes separated from Cys130 upon DsbA binding. This apparently enables Cys104 to contact Cys41 on the adjacent loop and helps prevent the unproductive backward resolution of the DsbA-DsbB complex. Although this structure represents a milestone in our understanding of the DsbA-DsbB machinery, there remains very limited kinetic data concerning the reactions between these proteins. We have therefore used rapid mixing kinetic measurements to analyze the reaction between DsbA and DsbB. Based on our results we present a kinetic scheme for the DsbB reaction cycle. This study begins to unravel the kinetic mechanism of an enzyme that converts the oxidizing equivalents of quinones to generate disulfide bonds. As such, it serves as the primary source of disulfide bonds in prokaryotes. Protein Expression and Purification—DsbA and DsbB proteins were expressed and purified essentially according to previously published protocols (5Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 47057-47065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Reduced DsbA was prepared by incubation with 50 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at room temperature, followed by extensive dialysis against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 1 mm EDTA. DsbA was confirmed to be in a fully reduced state as judged by reactivity with Ellman's reagent (26Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Stopped Flow Absorbance Measurements—Stopped flow absorbance measurements were performed on Hi-Tech Scientific SF61 instruments equipped with a either a 50-watt halogen lamp (for visible measurements) or a 75-watt xenon lamp (for UV measurements). Experiments were performed at 10 °C in PND buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 0.04% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, pH 8.0). Protein concentrations are given in the figure legends. Traces shown are representative of a minimum of six to eight successive shots, and the data for each trace were fit individually. The observed rates for each trace at a given concentration were then averaged, and error bars are shown as one standard deviation. Stopped Flow Fluorescence Measurements—Stopped flow fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Kintek instrument equipped with a 75-watt xenon lamp. An excitation wavelength of 295 nm (5 nm spectral bandpass) was used in conjunction with a 340-nm cutoff filter for emission. All fluorescence experiments were performed in PND buffer at 25 °C, and additional absorbance measurements (510 nm) were performed at 25 °C for comparison. Traces shown are representative of a minimum of six to eight successive shots, and the data for each trace were fit individually. Enzyme-monitored Turnover—Multiple turnover experiments were performed using a HiTech SF61 instrument according to the protocol established by Gibson et al. (27Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μm DsbB was mixed with 100 μm DsbA and 200 μm quinone (Q1) 4The abbreviations used are: Q1, ubiquinone 1; UQ, ubiquinone; MK, menaquinone; Q8, ubiquinone 8; WT, wild type. in PND buffer at 10 °C, and absorbance at 510 nm was monitored over time. The time course of the disappearance of the purple intermediate of DsbB is related to the rate of enzyme turnover, and this trace was used to derive a velocity versus [DsbA] plot using program A. Data Analysis—Curve fitting was performed with Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software) using equations for single, double, and triple exponential functions. Errors are reported as ±1 S.D. DsbA is critical for catalyzing disulfide bond formation in proteins in the bacterial periplasm, which it accomplishes by directly oxidizing substrate proteins via dithiol-disulfide exchange (3Frech C. Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 4Zapun A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5202-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In order to be maintained in a catalytically active state, reduced DsbA must then be reoxidized by DsbB. It has been shown previously that reduced DsbA initially attacks the Cys104–Cys130 disulfide of DsbB (14Guilhot C. Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9895-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Kishigami S. Ito K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Kishigami S. Kanaya E. Kikuchi M. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17072-17074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This binding is followed by a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction with a second disulfide (Cys40–Cys44) of DsbB. The resulting free thiolate anion of Cys44 is involved in a charge-transfer complex with the DsbB-bound quinone cofactor to give a characteristic absorbance at ∼510 nm (11Inaba K. Takahashi Y.H. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We took advantage of this spectral intermediate to study the kinetic mechanism of DsbB. Time-resolved spectra collected by rapid mixing of equimolar concentrations of DsbAred and DsbBox are shown in Fig. 2A. Two notable features become apparent upon analysis of these spectra; first is the rapid increase in absorbance at ∼510 nm, which reaches a maximum at ∼200 ms and then decays with a slower rate back to approximately the initial level. Second is the absorbance peak at ∼400 nm, which does not change substantially during the first 200 ms after mixing but then decays at a rate similar to that of the absorbance decay at 510 nm (see Fig. 2, B and C, for kinetic traces of absorbance changes at 400 and 510 nm derived from the spectra). Ubiquinone has a weak absorbance peak at ∼400 nm (ϵ ∼ 420 m–1 cm–1) that essentially disappears upon reduction. 5T. Tapley, unpublished data. Reduction of 15 μm DsbB-bound quinone would be expected to cause a decrease in absorbance at 400 nm of 0.0063, and the observed absorbance change was ∼0.01. Therefore, the simplest interpretation of the data presented in Fig. 2 is that the rise in absorbance at 510 nm reflects the generation of the DsbB Cys44-quinone charge-transfer intermediate, and the subsequent decay (at both 400 and 510 nm) corresponds to quinone reduction. Note that this overall process is significantly faster than reported in a similar previously published experiment (11Inaba K. Takahashi Y.H. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This is most likely because of differences in pH and temperature. It seems likely that in vivo (i.e. at pH 7 and 37 °C) the process will be even faster. To obtain more accurate rate constants, we monitored the formation and decay of the purple intermediate of DsbB using single wavelength measurements at 510 nm. A representative trace obtained upon mixing equimolar DsbAred and DsbBox is shown in Fig. 3A. The data do not fit well to a double exponential function (see Fig. 3B for residuals). A triple exponential function (see Fig. 3C for residuals) yielded an excellent fit, suggesting that the purple intermediate (the Cys44-quinone charge-transfer complex) decays in a two-step process. The absorbance increase is because of the formation of the intermediate at a rate of 10 ± 0.5 s–1 (k1obs), and the decay of this intermediate occurred in two phases of 1.8 ± 0.08 and 0.28 ± 0.03 s–1 (k2obs and k3obs). The amplitudes of the first and second phases are roughly equal and opposite (ΔA = 0.045 and –0.04 respectively), with the third phase comprising only ∼10% of the decay phase (ΔA =–0.005). We performed a series of experiments over a range of DsbA concentrations to determine which rates were associated with the initial reaction(s) with DsbA, as opposed to subsequent intramolecular reaction steps. The traces were fit to triple exponential functions, and the observed rates were plotted against DsbA concentration. As shown in Fig. 4A, the rate of formation of the purple intermediate is highly dependent upon DsbA concentration (k1 = 5.2 × 105 m–1 s–1). This was somewhat surprising because the purple intermediate is thought to correspond to an interaction between Cys44 of DsbB and the bound ubiquinone (11Inaba K. Takahashi Y.H. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Inaba K. Takahashi Y.H. Ito K. Hayashi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). DsbA, however, has been shown to initially cleave the Cys104–Cys130 disulfide of DsbB (14Guilhot C. Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9895-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Kishigami S. Ito K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Kishigami S. Kanaya E. Kikuchi M. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17072-17074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1), which in turn triggers a thiol-disulfide exchange that results in the cleavage of the Cys40–Cys44 disulfide of DsbB (leaving a free thiolate at position 44). Therefore, the purple intermediate forms only after an intramolecular thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. Because it is an intramolecular reaction, this step is expected be independent of DsbA concentration unless the rate of DsbA binding is slower than the intramolecular thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. The results in Fig. 4A are therefore suggestive of a thiol-disulfide exchange event that is much faster (≫50 s–1) than the rate of DsbA binding and formation of its mixed disulfide under our experimental conditions. This rapid disulfide exchange reaction enables tight coupling of the process to the reduction of ubiquinone. The dissociation of DsbA occurs at a much slower rate (k–1, as given by the y-intercept of Fig. 4A, ∼1.6 s–1). Unlike the absorbance increase at 510 nm, the two subsequent decay phases show little dependence on DsbA concentration (see Fig. 4, B and C), indicating that these are intramolecular reaction steps. The major decay phase (k2) occurs with a rate of ∼2s–1 over the full range of DsbA concentrations tested, whereas the minor decay (k3) occurred at a rate of 0.3 s–1. The results presented in Fig. 2 suggest that the absorbance decay at 410 nm (and the corresponding decay at 510 nm) corresponds to the rate(s) of quinone reduction. The observation that these rates (k2 and k3) do not depend on DsbA concentration is also consistent with this hypothesis. To further test this, we utilized the absorbance properties of ubiquinone, which absorbs strongly at 275 nm in the oxidized state, but is dramatically decreased upon reduction (Δϵ275 =–12,250 m–1 cm–1). This gives us a robust and reliable spectroscopic signal by which to monitor the rate of quinone reduction. We therefore performed stopped flow absorbance measurements at 275 nm under the same conditions used in Fig. 3. As expected, the absorbance at 275 nm decreases upon mixing DsbA and DsbB (Fig. 5). This trace is well described by a double exponential function (see Fig. 5, B and C, for residuals for single and double exponential fits), with observed rates of ∼1.5 and 0.23 s–1. These rates are very similar to the rates of decay of the purple intermediate, indicating that the rates of absorbance decay at 510 nm indeed correspond to the rate(s) of quinone reduction. As was observed for absorbance measurements at 510 nm, the magnitude of the first phase is dominant (0.045) and followed by a smaller minor decay phase (0.015). Based on the known extinction change at 275 nm between oxidized and reduced ubiquinone, these absorbance changes suggest that ∼40% of the bound quinone is reduced in this process. This may reflect the presence of a fraction of inactive enzyme in our preparations, or the extinction coefficient of DsbB-bound quinone is different from that of free quinone in aqueous buffer. More complete kinetic analysis (as in Fig. 4) was not be carried out because of the high absorbance at 275 nm at high protein concentrations, although experiments conducted with 75 μm DsbA suggested that the rates of absorbance decay at 275 nm (∼1.6 and 0.25 s–1) are independent of DsbA concentration (data not shown), as was observed for absorbance measurements at 510 nm. Therefore, the signal observed at 275 nm, which we interpret as a decrease in absorbance because of quinone reduction, reflects intramolecular reaction steps. This suggests that quinone reduction does not occur via direct interaction with DsbA, which is in line with the current model for DsbB action. The results presented thus far suggest that the decay of absorbance at 510 and 275 nm is because of reduction of the DsbB-bound quinone. To exclude the possibility that changes in protein absorbance also contribute significantly to the observed signal at 275 nm, we performed similar experiments with a DsbA mutant (C33S) that lacks one of the two essential active site cysteines. As such, it cannot complete a dithiol-disulfide exchange reaction with DsbB and therefore does not support quinone reduction. It instead forms a stable mixed disulfide complex that is able to induce a stable purple intermediate form of DsbB (11Inaba K. Takahashi Y.H. Fujieda N. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6761-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), as diagramed in Fig. 6A. As shown in Fig. 6B, rapid mixing of equimolar amounts of DsbB with DsbA(C33S) resulted in a stable accumulation of the purple intermediate as evidenced by an absorbance increase at 510 nm. In contrast to experiments with WT DsbA, no subsequent absorbance decay was observed. In addition, analysis of absorbance changes at 275 nm showed that there was no decrease in signal upon mixing DsbB and DsbA(C33S) (Fig. 6B, lower trace). This confirms that changes in protein absorbance (at least up to the stage of a mixed disulfide complex between DsbB and DsbA) are not responsible for the observed absorbance decreases at 275 nm in experiments with WT DsbA but that the observed signal change (i.e. in Fig. 5A) is indeed because of quinone reduction. Order of Mixing Experiments—As purified, DsbB contains ∼1 molecule of tightly bound ubiquinone 8 (Q8). In previously published studies, it was unclear at which point the quinone begins to participate in the reaction. It has been proposed that DsbB oxidizes the DsbA active site cysteine pair and that DsbB is subsequently oxidized by ubiquinone. However, it is difficult to distinguish precisely when the quinone cofactor becomes an important reaction component in the overall process. To address this issue we purified a quinone-free form of DsbB (designated DsbBΔUQ) and performed order of mixing experiments. In one case we rapidly mixed DsbBΔUQ that had been pre-equilibrated with Q1 and with DsbA, and in the next experiment we mixed DsbBΔUQ with a solution containing DsbA and Q1. When preincubated DsbBΔUQ and Q1 were rapidly mixed with DsbA, a rapid increase in absorbance at 510 nm followed by a slower decay phase was observed (Fig. 7A), similar to results observed in previous experiments. The rate of absorbance increase was relatively unaffected by replacement of Q8 with Q1, implying that the rate of DsbA binding and the subsequent thiol-disulfide exchange reaction are not strongly dependent on the nature of the quinone cofactor. The rate of decay of the absorbance signal at 510 nm (i.e. the rate of quinone reduction), however, is ∼6-fold slower than when Q8 is present (compare Fig. 7A with Fig. 3). We have shown that the absorbance decay at 510 nm reflects the rate of quinone reduction. Thus, it appears that the isoprenoid tail of Q8 may help to optimally position the quinone within the active site of DsbB, making quinones with shorter lipid tails less than ideal cofactors for DsbB. We next tested whether the formation of the purple intermediate is dependent on a quinone being pre-bound to DsbB. When we preincubated DsbBΔUQ and DsbA, and then mixed with Q1, we did not observe any appreciable absorbance changes at 510 nm (Fig. 7A, lower trace). Absorbance changes at 275 nm (Fig. 7B) echoed the results obtained at 510 nm; preincubation of DsbBΔUQ and DsbA followed by mixing with Q1 led to very little signal. Taken together, these results suggest that a pre-bound quinone on DsbB is required for formation of the purple intermediate of DsbB (transient absorbance at 510 nm) as well as for efficient quinone reduction (absorbance decrease at 275 nm). There are several reasons why this could be the case. First, the entire reaction may be a highly concerted process that requires quinone to be in place before disulfide exchange between DsbA and DsbB occurs, and mixing DsbA and DsbB in the absence of quinone could lead to an off pathway reaction. Alternatively, DsbA binding may occlude the quinone-binding site and thereby prevent quinone binding. This seems very unlikely, however, based on the recently solved structure of the DsbA-DsbB complex (24Inaba K. Murakami S. Suzuki M. Nakagawa A. Yamashita E. Okada K. Ito K. Cell. 2006; 127: 789-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Finally, Q1 binding to DsbB may be very slow. This also seems unlikely however, and we have performed steady-state and stopped flow fluorescence experiments that suggested, to the contrary, that Q1 binding is extremely fast (data not shown). Therefore, we are drawn back to our initial interpretation that the reaction between DsbA, DsbB, and ubiquinone is a highly concerted process. The highly concerted nature of the reaction explains why previous attempts to dissect the reaction mechanism of DsbB by looking at individual cysteine pairs yielded seemingly paradoxical results. The results presented in Fig. 7 clearly demonstrate that in order for the reaction to proceed efficiently, DsbB must have a quinone bound prior to DsbA binding. The high affinity of the natural UQ8 cofactor would ensure that this requirement is met in vivo. This tight association between DsbB and UQ8 raises the question of how reduced quinone (quinol) is oxidized to regenerate a catalytically competent DsbB. We see two possible solutions. First, the quinol form may bind with a weaker affinity and upon reduction may dissociate from DsbB to be reoxidized by cytochrome oxidases. This would be"

Oesophageal adenocarcinoma arises from Barrett's oesophagus, progresses rapidly and is usually fatal. The contribution of perturbed TGFbeta signalling in the promotion of metastasis in this disease has not been elucidated. We therefore investigated the role of TGFbeta in Barrett's associated oesophageal adenocarcinoma using a panel of cell lines (OE33, TE7, SEG, BIC, FLO). 4/5 adenocarcinoma cell lines failed to cell cycle arrest, down-regulate c-Myc or induce p21 in response to TGFbeta, and modulation of a Smad3/4 specific promoter was inhibited. These hyperproliferative adenocarcinoma cell lines displayed a TGFbeta induced increase in the expression of the extracellular matrix degrading proteinases, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), which correlated with an invasive cell phenotype as measured by in vitro migration, invasion and cell scattering assays. Inhibiting ERK and JNK pathways significantly reduced PAI and uPA induction and inhibited the invasive cell phenotype. These results suggest that TGFbeta Smad-dependent signalling is perturbed in Barrett's carcinogenesis, resulting in failure of growth-arrest. However, TGFbeta can promote PAI and uPA expression and invasion through MAPK pathways. These data would support a dual role for TGFbeta in oesophageal adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2091466587,"Endothelial integrity regulates vascular tone, luminal patency, and the immune reactivity to tissue grafts. Endothelial dysfunction is the first marker and site of disease initiation and severity. It has long been known that endothelial biochemical function is density dependent, and we have recently shown that endothelial immunobiology is anchorage dependent. Matrix-embedded endothelial cells (EC) establish a controlled anchorage state and are not only immune protected but also induce a system immune protective state. We now define this aspect of vascular and immune biology in detail. The in vitro immune response of allogeneic splenocytes (proliferation, lytic activity, and cytokine expression) on exposure to aortic EC was significantly reduced if EC were embedded within three-dimensional collagen matrices (3D-EC; P<0.005) to an even greater extent than EC that had reached confluence as monolayers on tissue culture plates (EC-TCPS). Splenocyte reactivity was enhanced with repeated exposure to EC-TCPS but minimally if preexposed to 3D-EC (P<0.002). 3D-EC induced significantly greater differentiation of splenocytes into CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells than EC-TCPS (P<0.02). The reduced response to 3D-EC and potential protective effect to subsequent exposure were confirmed in vivo. Repeated exposure of immune-competent mice to injections of xenogeneic EC-TCPS induced vigorous host immunity. In contrast, prior implantation of 3D-EC induced hyporesponsiveness toward subsequent injection of EC-TCPS with reduced humoral response, decreased lytic activity, and lower frequency of effector splenocytes (P<0.001). EC interaction with its matrix determines phenotype, viability, and biosecretory potential. We now show that this microenvironmental interaction also influences endothelial-mediated activation of allo- and xenogeneic immune cells. 3D matrix-embedding limits the ability of EC to initiate adaptive immunity, and initial exposure to 3D-EC confers hyporesponsiveness to subsequent exposure to immunogeneic EC. These effects transcended the traditional control that confluence imposes on EC and reflects perhaps even higher order control. Our findings might offer novel insights to endothelial-mediated diseases and potential cell-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2043875497,"The regulation of membrane curvature plays an important role in many membrane trafficking and fusion events. Recent studies have begun to identify some of the proteins involved in controlling and sensing the curvature of cellular membranes. A mechanistic understanding of these processes is limited, however, as structural information for the membrane-bound forms of these proteins is scarce. Here, we employed a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches to study the interaction of annexin B12 with membranes of different curvatures. We observed selective and Ca2+-independent binding of annexin B12 to negatively charged vesicles that were either highly curved or that contained lipids with negative intrinsic curvature. This novel curvature-dependent membrane interaction induced major structural rearrangements in the protein and resulted in a backbone fold that was different from that of the well characterized Ca2+-dependent membrane-bound form of annexin B12. Following curvature-dependent membrane interaction, the protein retained a predominantly α-helical structure but EPR spectroscopy studies of nitroxide side chains placed at selected sites on annexin B12 showed that the protein underwent inside-out refolding that brought previously buried hydrophobic residues into contact with the membrane. These structural changes were reminiscent of those previously observed following Ca2+-independent interaction of annexins with membranes at mildly acidic pH, yet they occurred at neutral pH in the presence of curved membranes. The present data demonstrate that annexin B12 is a sensor of membrane curvature and that membrane curvature can trigger large scale conformational changes.

Control of membrane curvature is an important part of many cellular events (1McMahon H.T. Gallop J.L. Nature. 2005; 438: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). To better understand the molecular mechanisms by which proteins can sense or induce curvature, structural information is essential. Much has been learned from high resolution crystal structures of curvature-inducing proteins, including BAR domain proteins or epsins (2Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R.

Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). In the case of BAR domain proteins, it has been shown that these proteins form highly curved helical bundles that appear to be complementary in shape to curved membranous structures. Consequently, it has been suggested that these helical bundles act as a scaffold for membrane curvature (2Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2898-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 4Masuda M. Takeda S. Sone M. Ohki T. Mori H. Kamioka Y. Mochizuki N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). While this structural information is clearly important, analysis of the membrane-bound state is still necessary to fully understand the mechanisms by which proteins interact with curved membranes. For example, the N-terminal region of the BAR domain protein endophilin is known to be important for membrane interaction, yet the crystal structure does not provide any structural information for this region. In fact, this region is disordered in the absence of membranes but assumes an amphipathic α-helical structure when in contact with membranes (2Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2898-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Similarly, an α-helical structure is also induced as curvature-sensing proteins, such as ARF-GAP and α-synuclein, bind to membranes (8Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 9Bigay J. Casella J.F. Drin G. Mesmin B. Antonny B.

Thus, to better understand how proteins can sense or induce membrane curvature, it is important to know how membrane curvature can affect protein structure. In the present study we identified a novel membrane curvature-sensing property of annexin B12. Annexins are soluble proteins that reversibly associate with phospholipid membranes (12Seaton B.A. Seaton B.A. Annexins: Molecular Structure to Cellular Function. R.G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). Since annexins can be expressed, purified, and chemically labeled as well behaved soluble proteins prior to inducing membrane binding, their structures can be investigated by approaches that avoid some of the technical difficulties typically encountered in investigations of conventional membrane proteins.

As illustrated with the structure of annexin B12 (Fig. 1A), in the absence of membranes, annexins are disk-shaped proteins that typically consist of four highly homologous repeats. Each repeat contains a four-helical bundle and a fifth helix located on top of the bundle (13Luecke H. Chang B.T. Mailliard W.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Haigler H.T. Nature. 1995; 378: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The convex side has eight interhelical membrane- and Ca2+-binding loops that mediate Ca2+-dependent membrane interactions by a Ca2+-bridging mechanism (40Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O.

At acidic pH (∼4-5 in the case phosphatidylserine-containing vesicles), annexin B12 forms a transmembrane structure (22Isas J.M. Patel D.R. Jao C. Jayasinghe S. Cartailler J.P. Haigler H.T. Langen R.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3015-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This transmembrane structure is generated by an “inside-out” refolding that brings buried hydrophobic residues of the solution structure into contact with the hydrophobic region of the phospholipid bilayer. Structural analysis of two helix-loop-helix regions of the soluble protein has revealed that each helical hairpin rotates inside-out and, together with the intervening loop region, forms a continuous transmembrane amphipathic helix. Other homologous helical hairpin regions are also thought to undergo comparable conformational changes (Fig. 1D). At higher pH values (∼5-5.5 in the case of phosphatidylserine-containing vesicles), annexin B12 undergoes a similar inside-out refolding process but binds to the interfacial region of the membrane rather than forming a transmembrane structure (26Hegde B.G. Isas J.M. Zampighi G. Haigler H.T. Langen R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 934-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). The interfacial form may be a kinetic intermediate in the formation of the transmembrane form. To date, all structural studies of Ca2+-independent membrane interactions of annexins have been performed in vitro in model membranes at acidic pH. Nonetheless, these studies are thought to reflect physiological processes because Ca2+-independent interactions occur in intact cells. Since it is not reasonable to expect cells to regulate the interaction of annexins with membranes by global changes in cytosolic pH, it has been suggested that appropriate lipid compositions could promote such interactions at neutral pH in vivo (22Isas J.M. Patel D.R. Jao C. Jayasinghe S. Cartailler J.P. Haigler H.T. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30227-30234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by in vitro experiments showing that pH-dependent membrane interaction of annexin B12 is strongly modulated by lipid composition (22Isas J.M. Patel D.R. Jao C. Jayasinghe S. Cartailler J.P. Haigler H.T. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30227-30234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here, we show for the first time that an annexin is a Ca2+-independent sensor of membrane curvature or curvature strain at neutral pH. Structural analysis using site-directed spin labeling as well as CD demonstrates that annexin B12 undergoes major curvature-dependent conformational changes but still retains a helical structure overall. Like the pH-dependent membrane-bound form, the curvature-dependent form also undergoes an inside-out refolding that brings buried hydrophobic residues of the solution structure into contact with the membrane. Together, these findings demonstrate that membrane curvature can have dramatic effects on protein structure and that these effects can go as far as causing a complete structural reorganization. These data raise the possibility that curved membranes or lipids with high intrinsic negative curvature induce Ca2+-independent interaction of annexin B12 with membranes at neutral pH in vivo. Protein Expression and Purification—Unless otherwise noted, “annexin B12” used in this study was the recombinant protein in which the two endogenous cysteine residues were replaced with alanine (C113A/C303A) (39Langen R. Isas J.M. Luecke H. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22453-22457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The annexin B12 single-cysteine mutants K132C, F147C, and D264C and the double-cysteine mutants A77C/K265C and 113/S241C were recombinantly expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (22Isas J.M.

Haigler H.T. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32398-32404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The annexin B12 double mutant 255C/266C was constructed by replacing the histidine at position 255 and the threonine at position 266 in the recombinant Cys-less wild type with cysteines using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The mutations were tolerated well. Co-pelleting of 255C/266C and phospholipids displayed Ca2+-dependent results that were similar to native annexin B12. Purified annexin B12 mutants were stored at -70 °C in HEPES buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4) containing NaCl (100 mm) and dithiothreitol (1 mm). Vesicle Preparation and Gel Filtration Assay—The following lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and used for vesicle (liposome) preparation: 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-l-serine) (PS), 3The abbreviations used are: PS, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-l-serine); PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholin; PA, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate; DAG, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol; atidylserine; CL, 1,1′2,2′-tetraoleoyl cardiolipin; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles; SUV, small unilamellar vesicles; R1, the nitroxide side chain illustrated in Fig. 4A; NiEDDA, nickel-ethylenediamine-N,N′-diacetic acid; π(NiEDDA), accessibility of the R1 side chain to NiEDDA; π(O2), accessibility of the R1 side chain to O2. 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC), 1,1′2,2′-tetraoleoyl cardiolipin (sodium salt) (CL), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol (diacylglycerol, DAG), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (PA). Large unilammelar phospholipid vesicles (LUV) of a 2:1 molar ratio for PS/PC were prepared according to the (44Reeves J.P. Dowben R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1969; 73: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Preparations of 100- and 50-nm vesicles (diameter) were prepared by repeatedly extruding (10 times) the lipid through a polycarbonate membrane of the desired size using a mini extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). Small unilammelar vesicles (SUV) were prepared by bath sonication (three times 20 min or until the suspension was clear). Size distribution of the SUVs and extruded vesicles was then recorded by quasi-elastic light scattering (Malvern Instruments). Unless otherwise indicated, a standard binding assay was employed using annexin B12 in HEPES buffer (20 mm at pH 7.4) containing NaCl (100 mm) with either 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA added. Annexin B12 and liposomes were mixed in a molar ratio of 1:1000 and incubated 15 min at room temperature. LUVs were pelleted in a tabletop centrifuge (13,200 relative centrifugal force, room temperature). In certain experiments, liposomes were applied onto a gel filtration column (Superdex 75, 25/600) equilibrated with HEPES-NaCl, pH 7.4, containing either 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. The gel filtration fractions were collected, further concentrated using an Amicon Ultra concentrator (Millipore, 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff), and analyzed either by EPR spectroscopy or by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Spin Labeling and EPR Spectroscopy—Purified annexin B12 single- and double-cysteine mutants were subjected to size exclusion chromatography (PD-10, Amersham Biosciences) to remove dithiothreitol. The protein was eluted with 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl directly into a 10-fold excess of 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-d3-pyrroline-3-methyl methane thiosulfonate spin label to prevent incomplete labeling by reoxidation of cysteines. The reaction was allowed to continue for 2 h at room temperature, and unreacted label was removed by size exclusion chromatography (PD-10 column, Amersham Biosciences). EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature on an X-band Bruker EMX spectrometer fitted with either a Bruker ER4123D dielectric resonator or a Bruker ER4119HS resonator. Magnetic field scan widths for EPR spectra were 200 or 100 gauss. Unless otherwise indicated, each sample contained 30 μg of spin-labeled annexin B12 and the protein/phospholipid molar ratio was ∼1:1000. The spectra for soluble annexin B12 were recorded in the presence of 30% sucrose to reduce protein tumbling. The EPR power saturation method was used to measure the accessibilities of oxygen and chelated nickel (NiEDDA). The oxygen concentration was that of oxygen in equilibrium with air, and the NiEDDA concentration was 100 mm. The membrane immersion depth, d, for nitroxide-labeled residues was calculated from the parameter Φ= ln π(O2)/π(NiEDDA) (45Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 46Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The calibration of Φ in terms of depth for SUVs was obtained with the use of 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(doxyl)-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine, with the spin label attached at the 5, 7, 10, and 12 positions on the acyl chains, as described (25Kim Y.E.

A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The following equation was used to calculate the depth for SUV binding: d[Å] = 6.1 Φ+ 4.1. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopy Co., Tokyo, Japan). Routinely, 25-50 scans were recorded and averaged between 200 and 260 nm. Samples of vesicle-bound annexin B12 were prepared by gel filtration, and the appropriate fractions were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra concentrator (Millipore, 10 kDa molecular mass). The protein/phospholipid molar ratio was ∼1:1000. CD spectra were recorded in a 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, using a 1-mm optical path length quartz cell. The background was corrected using appropriate protein-free samples. The Effect of Curvature on Membrane Interaction of Annexin B12—To evaluate whether membrane curvature modulates annexin B12 membrane interaction, we developed a gel filtration assay that monitors the binding of annexin B12 to vesicles of different size and lipid composition. In this assay, all of the vesicles tested eluted at the excluded volume (∼106 ml) and the soluble annexin B12 eluted at ∼172 ml (data not shown). In the presence of relatively large (100-nm diameter) phospholipid vesicles (67:33 mol % PS/PC) at pH 7.4, annexin B12 eluted at fractions 24-28 (peak at ∼172 ml) in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 2A, upper panel) and at fractions 14-17 (peak at ∼106 ml) in the presence of Ca2+ (1 mm) (Fig. 2B, lower panel); this was determined by assaying for the presence of the protein by PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. These results were expected because quantitative Ca2+-dependent binding to phospholipid vesicles is a well established property of annexin B12 (12Seaton B.A. Seaton B.A. Annexins: Molecular Structure to Cellular Function. R.G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). The gel filtration assay described above was used to monitor the interaction of annexin B12 with vesicles varying in size from SUV (10-36-nm diameter) to LUV (∼0.5-10 μm (44Reeves J.P. Dowben R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1969; 73: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar)). In the presence of 1 mm Ca2+, all detectable annexin B12 co-eluted with vesicles regardless of their size (Fig. 2B), and no peak corresponding to soluble protein was observed (data not shown). A very different result was obtained in the presence of 1 mm EGTA. Here, annexin B12 bound to SUVs (Fig. 2C) but did not associate with any of the larger vesicles. Thus, annexin B12 was capable of interacting with membranes in a curvature-dependent manner that did not require Ca2+ or acidic pH. Using the gel filtration assay, we also investigated the interaction of annexin B12 with SUVs containing various mixtures of PS and PC. As shown in Fig. 2D, the interaction of annexin B12 with these SUVs strongly depended on the PS content of the vesicles. While little or no membrane interaction could be observed with vesicles containing only PC (0% PS), increasing membrane interaction could be detected with increasing PS content (Fig. 2D). To estimate the amount of binding we quantified the amount of unbound protein using the absorbance of the unbound protein during gel filtration (data not shown). Based upon this analysis, annexin B12 binding was quantitative in"

https://openalex.org/W2105290529,"In this essay/hypothesis, I assess the statistical technology used in the NIH peer review of research proposals. In the NIH system of proposal review, sample sizes are inappropriately small, samples are highly selective or nonrandom which makes the review particularly susceptible to bias—the samples are not independently derived, the scoring precision is unrealistically high, and the arithmetic mean is the only statistical value considered. I propose a complementary peer review system that addresses these issues. Moreover, I hypothesize that innovative grant applications can be assessed in a system with robust statistical procedures by measures of dispersion such as variance and/or kurtosis. The identification of innovation has been a longterm deficiency at NIH. The peer review of grant proposals is an essential part of the management of biomedical research. Consequently, it is reasonable to consider how statistics are used in this peer review process. First, NIH and most funding agencies assess grant applications by requesting reviews from just two or three qualified persons. The number of samples is constrained by the large size of the grant applications and by writing proposals narrowly for extreme experts in narrowly defined fields. Second, peer review does not use random sampling of the relevant population. Instead experts are chosen based on their perceived expertise and qualifications. Unfortunately, this sampling scheme is particularly subject to bias because the extreme experts have a vested interest in the current paradigms. Third, the review process used by NIH and others involves discussions among reviewers. These discussions are meant to provide consensus, not to assess the distribution of sensibilities among the relevant population of scientists. The scores provided in this system are not independently derived, but independence of the observations is a valuable attribute for statistical analysis. Fourth, NIH uses a 41-grade scoring system which suggests an unrealistic degree of precision. A high-precision score is needed to distinguish among the many applications in a situation with only two or three dependent samples being collected. Finally, peer review of grant applications at NIH and most funding agencies uses a single statistic, the arithmetic mean. The use of this single statistic may be reasonable for a normal distribution of parametrically related observations; yet, scores given in peer review are not necessarily normally distributed and are definitely not parametrically related. Although funding agencies use statistical techniques that are constrained and although they largely ignore the distribution of reviews among the relevant peer group, their system has been successful in identifying excellent grant proposals. What NIH and other funding agencies have specifically struggled with is the identification of innovative ideas. Innovation and excellence are easily conflated; nevertheless, their distinction is essential in establishing the most potent funding policies. Excellence is the property that indicates a high degree of certainty that the proposed work will enhance our scientific understanding or capabilities. The trade-off is the inverse relationship between the degree of certainty and the degree of the enhancement. Excellence usually provides us with small steps forward. In contrast, innovation is the property that indicates novelty which carries with it a low degree of certainty of success. Although innovative projects lack certainty, the potential for huge enhancements in our scientific understanding or"
