https://openalex.org/W2049469558,"An analysis of major U.S. crops shows that there is a large genetic potential for yield that is unrealized because of the need for better adaptation of the plants to the environments in which they are grown. Evidence from native populations suggests that high productivity can occur in these environments and that opportunities for improving production in unfavorable environments are substantial. Genotypic selection for adaptation to such environments has already played an important role in agriculture, but the fundamental mechanisms are poorly understood. Recent scientific advances make exploration of these mechanisms more feasible and could result in large gains in productivity."

Particular attention is given to surface reaction chemistry as it is related to heterogenous catalysis, a subject area where there are abundant opportunities for detailed measurements of structure and dynamics at the molecular level."

Using current radioastronomical technology, it is possible for us to receive signals from civilizations no more advanced than we are over a distance of at least many thousands of light years. The cost of a systematic international research effort, using existing radio telescopes, is as low as a few million dollars per year for one or two decades. The program would be more than a million times more thorough than all previous searches, by all nations, put together. The results – whether positive or negative – would have profound implications for our view of our universe and ourselves. We believe such a coordinated search program is well justified on its scientific merits. It will also have important subsidiary benefits for radioastronomy in general. It is a scientific activity that seems likely to garner substantial public support. In addition, because of the growing problem of radiofrequency interference by civilian and military transmitters, the search program will become more difficult the longer we wait. This is the time to begin. It has been suggested that the apparent absence of a major reworking of the Galaxy by very advanced beings, or the apparent absence of extraterrestrial colonists in the solar system, demonstrates that there are no extraterrestrial intelligent beings anywhere. At the very least, this argument depends on a major extrapolation from the circumstances on Earth, here and now. The radio search, on the other hand, assumes nothing about other civilizations that has not transpired in ours. The undersigned* are scientists from a variety of disciplines and nations who have considered the problem of extraterrestrial intelligence – some of us for more than 20 years. We represent a wide variety of opinion on the abundance of extraterrestrials, on the ease of establishing contact, and on the validity of arguments of the sort summarized in the first sentence of the previous paragraph. But we are unanimous in our conviction that the only significant test of the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence is an experimental one. No a priori arguments on this subject can be compelling or should be used as a substitute for an observational program. We urge the organization of a coordinated, worldwide, and systematic search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
