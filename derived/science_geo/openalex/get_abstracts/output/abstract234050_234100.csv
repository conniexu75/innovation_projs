Dustin1 reported that certain chemical agents which he called “poisons caryoclasiques” were able to exert a toxic action on cell nuclei without apparently injuring the cytoplasm. It has since wide variety of compounds can act in this way(see, for example, reviews by Dustin2 and Astaldi et al.3), and, since they appear to be active only on dividing cells, they have sometimes been called mitotic poisons."

https://openalex.org/W2024723450,"Partridge1 and Westall2 have stressed the need for the complete removal of electrolytes in preparing solutions for paper chromatography when the subsequent development of the chromatogram involves the use of ammoniacal silver nitrate. The use of ion-exchange columns—'Zeo-Karb 215' and 'Deacidite E'—for this purpose in the routine analysis of dilute solutions of sugars in Ringer phosphate incubates proved slow and uncertain in our hands. The following procedure, however, based on the solubility of sugars and the insolubility of inorganic salts in pyridine, has given a consistent elimination of salt effects in our chromatographic studies, and is well suited to routine investigations."

https://openalex.org/W2031184908,"IT was previously shown that the secretion of both fructose and citric acid in the male accessory organs of reproduction is governed by, and responds readily to, the fluctuations in the level of the male sex hormone. This close relationship made it practical to use the estimation of fructose and citric acid, either in semen or in the accessory glands, as a 'chemical indicator test' for the male hormone1'2'3. Recently, in the course of a metabolic study of transplants from accessory glands of the rat, it was found that when small pieces of male glands were dissected from young rats and transplanted subcutaneously into male or female hosts, such transplants grew readily in response to testosterone propionate or normally secreted testis hormone, and when fully developed exhibited a high content of fructose and pitric acid4,5."

This is normally accomplished by the Feulgen hydrolysis, namely, by hydrolysis in N hydrochloric acid for a su1,2,3 suitable period at 60° C. More recently, some authors have treated fixed root tips with pectic enzymes. It was thought that it might be possible to separate the living cells with a pectinase complex and so be able to study mitosis and the sites of nucleic acid in living cells, and also the effects of fixation and of other treatments. Experiments were made to investigate this possibility."
https://openalex.org/W2069032973,"IT has been shown in water culture1 that the rate of phosphorus absorption by plants is, Under certain conditions, significantly reduced when activities of phosphorus-32 as low as 10 microcuries per are used as a tracer. Root-growth is also depressed ; nevertheless, the development of the aerial parts of plants provides no consistent index of radiation damage. These effects are explained by the metabolic accumulation of labelled phosphorus, which may cause the root tips of rapidly absorbing plants to, be exposed to radiation many hundred times more intense than that in the culture solution."

https://openalex.org/W1997419481,"ANALOGUES of folio acid have been found capable of inhibiting the growth of the Rous sarcoma in chickens1 and sarcoma 180 in mice2, of causing a remission in leukaemic children3 and of prolonging the survival of leukaemic mice4. The effect of twelve of these analogues (all samples of folic acid and its analogues were kindly supplied by Lederle Laboratories, Pearl River, New York) on the growth of tumours induced by the crown gall bacterium on carrot tissue has been tested. Cylinders of tissue 10 mm. diameter × 6 mm. high were removed as described in a previous communication5, and inoculated with virulent crown gall bacteria. Four days later, when the first signs of tumour formation became visible along the line of the cambium, 0.05 ml. of a 1/1,000 solution of the folic acid analogue to be tested was dropped on to, and spread over, the surface of the tissue. The amount of substance applied was 0.05 mgm. per fragment. Sterile distilled water was applied to the control group. Twenty carrot fragments were used in each test. The accompanying table shows the percentage of fragments which had developed macroscopically visible tumours four weeks after treatment had been applied."

They further pointed out that the ferric chloride colour test for this substance is not specific. However, since kojic acid must be present in fairly high concentration if it is responsible for an inhibitory effect with, for example, the cylinder-plate test, it can usually be obtained in crude crystalline form by allowing an ether extract of crude culture fluid, made at about pH 5, to evaporate."
https://openalex.org/W2088639541,"OUR knowledge of the amino-acid composition of Bence–Jones protein is still incomplete. Recently, Dent1 has analysed a specimen of Bence–Jones protein, using paper partition chromatography, with regard to its amino-acid composition. He found that the specimen contained all the common amino-acids except methionine and hydroxyproline. Dent's findings were at variance with those of Devine2, who found methionine present in amount 0.58 per cent."
https://openalex.org/W1982962718,"SAMUEL JOHNSO once observed how quietly people will endurey an evil which they might at any time very easily remedy ; he gave as an instance a family which had possessed an island for more than four hundred years and never made a commodious landing-place though a few men with pick-axes might have cut a staircase out of the rock in a week's time. At the recent meeting of the British Association at New castle upon Tyne, Section J (Psychology) held a discussion on the “Human Problems in the Design of Machinery and Working Methods"", and it was emphasized that, although knowledge is increasing, even modern communities have as yet little scientific understanding of these questions. In fact, Dr. Johnson's remark still holds good to-day, because many instances were quoted at Newcastle in which ordinary common sense has been lacking in the planning of the physical, psychological and social environments in which men work."
https://openalex.org/W2027996731,"AT the meeting in Newcastle upon Tyne of Section I (Physiology) of the British Association on September 6, the presidential address on “The Cell’ by Prof. R. A. Peters was followed by a group of papers on particular aspects of cellular physiology. Prof. Peters emphasized that recent work upon organised enzyme systems has already produced therapeutic results. In illustration, he chose two poisonous substances, iodoacetic acid (I:CH2·COOH) and flouroacetic acid (F.CH2·COOH), which have similar chemical structures but very dif?erent types of biochemical action. The iodine atom of the iodoacetic acid can easily take part in substitution reactions at neutral pH values, whereas the C—F group in ffuoroacetic rcid is very stable."

https://openalex.org/W2047858753,"IT is generally supposed that the only significant reaction produced by absorption, in the tissues, of infra-red radiation—and it applies practically to the radiation from electric lamps—is to cause a rise in temperature of the tissues, there being no attendant chemical effect such as accompanies ultra-violet irradiation. Thus, whereas for ultra-violet irradiation the energy absorption in a single treatment is of the order of 10 calories, in the case of infra-red radiation it is more than 10,000 times larger."
https://openalex.org/W1968549915,"THE pattern of tne geographical distribution of insects is very varied; but among the widely distributed specie we can recognize easily two types. First,the species which develops many local or geographical race's, such as the swallow-tail butterfly (papilio machaon)and the apollo butterfly (Par-nasstus apollo)in Europe; and secondly, the species which has little or no geographical variation over very large areas, such as certain locusts or the painted-lady butterfly (Pyrameis cardui). This latter type of distribution indicates a population within the area of which there are few natural barriers, and within which there is a continual mixing of individuals. It is associated with species which have great powers of movement ; and this movement can be either active and deliberate, as in the migration of locusts, or passive, due to distribution by air currents, as in the Aphidse and other small insects. By either of these methods, large numbers of individuals can move hundreds of miles."

https://openalex.org/W1991171966,"CONVENTIONAL methods of beta-ray measurement for checking the activity of a pure beta-emitter such as phosphorus-32, in therapeutic amounts, have the following disadvantages: (1) The container must be opened, and the sterility of the solutions sent out in sealed ampoules from Harwell) or in sealed screw-cap bottles (from the Atomic Energy Commission, U.S.A.) is thus interfered with. (2) Careful aliquots and high dilutions must be made, or careful evaporation procedures must be followed. In any event some handling of potentially dangerous material is involved. (3) These rather tedious procedures must be repeated if carrier-free material is to be subdivided. The activity of the subdivided amounts should be checked, as it is not possible to predict the loss by adsorption on the walls of the original container."
https://openalex.org/W1997497357,"Traina and Aleksandrowicz reported recently1 that, in contrast to the findings of Pasteur, Vallery-Radot, Halpern and Holtzer2, guinea pigs which survived a previous exposure to anaphylactic shock during antihistaminic treatment were protected against a second challenging injection of the sensitizing agent given one day later. These experiments were carried out on thirteen guinea pigs, of which two were used for control. The implication of such a result might become extremely broad from the point of view of the mechanism of action of antihistaminic drugs."
