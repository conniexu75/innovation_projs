Our analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences obtained from 20 distinct skin sites of healthy humans revealed that physiologically comparable sites harbor similar bacterial communities. The complexity and stability of the microbial community are dependent on the specific characteristics of the skin site. This topographical and temporal survey provides a baseline for studies that examine the role of bacterial communities in disease states and the microbial interdependencies required to maintain healthy skin."

However, the source of this synchrony is still unknown. Gregoriou et al. (p. 1207 ) tested the hypothesis that synchronized activity from the frontal eye field is one of the causes of the synchrony in monkey visual cortical area V4 during attention. With attention, neural activity in area V4 synchronized with frontal eye field activity when a stimulus fell in a joint receptive field, but did not do so when the fields were not overlapping."

Limiting both sources of CO 2 is necessary if we are to curb global warming. Wise et al. (p. 1183 ) use an integrated assessment model to explore the consequences of limiting atmospheric CO 2 concentrations at levels between 450 and 550 parts per million through a combination of fossil-fuel emissions reductions and land-use modification. Land-use modification strategies reduce the cost of limiting atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, but can make crop prices rise and transform human diets, for example, when people consume less beef and other carbon-intensive protein sources. The rate at which crop productivity is improved has a strong influence on emissions from land-use change. Thus, the technology used for growing crops is potentially as important for limiting atmospheric CO 2 as are approaches like CO 2 capture and storage."

Friedland et al. (p. 1199 ; see the Perspective by Smolke ) have constructed complementary Escherichia coli synthetic gene networks that keep track of prior molecular events to function as counters. These modular devices count up to three induction events over a range of frequencies and could be extended to higher numbers. Similar devices may find application in multi-event processes of cell biology, bioengineering, and, potentially, therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2017578060,"Arctic Energy Reserves The Arctic consists of approximately equal fractions of terrain above sea level, continental shelves with depths less than 500 meters, and deep ocean basins that have been mostly covered in ice. While the deep ocean regions probably have limited petroleum reserves, the shelf areas are likely to contain abundant ones. Based on the limited amount of exploration data available, Gautier et al. (p. 1175 ) have constructed a probabilistic, geology-based estimate of how much oil and gas may be found. Approximately 30% of the world's undiscovered gas, and 13% of its undiscovered oil, may be found north of the Arctic Circle. Advances in the technology of hydrocarbon recovery, as well as vanishing ice cover around the North Pole, make the Arctic an increasingly attractive region for energy source development, although the existing reserves are probably not large enough to shift current production patterns significantly."
https://openalex.org/W2076961967,"Editing Expectations Although genetic information is stored in DNA, and faithfully copied into RNA, the cell can make the odd (and occasionally vitally important) change to the meaning of code during a process known as RNA editing. Thirteen edited genes are known in the nonrepetitive portion of the human genome, but the overall prevalence of RNA editing is unclear. Li et al. (p. 1210 ), used an unbiased genome-wide approach to identify 239 sites (in 207 target genes), with stringent criteria for editing. The sites identified included 10 of the 13 known edited genes. Fourteen out of 18 randomly chosen sites were validated by sequencing, and these putatively edited genes were enriched for synapse, cell trafficking, and membrane functions. Furthermore, lowering the search stringency suggested that many more human genes may be edited at lower frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2128252132,"The emission line arising from a transition of an electron from the iron K shell to the ground state (the K line) is prominent in the reflection spectrum of the hard X-ray continuum irradiating dense accreting matter around a black hole. The corresponding iron L-line emission should be detectable when iron abundance is high. That's the theory, and now broad iron L-line emission has been observed, together with the broad K line in the narrow-line Seyfert galaxy 1H0707. There is a reverberation lag of about 30 s between the direct X-ray continuum and its reflection from matter falling into the hole, a timescale comparable to the light-crossing time of the innermost radii around a supermassive black hole. This discovery opens a window on events close to the black hole event horizon in these objects. Emission arising from a transition of an electron from the iron K shell to the ground state (the K line) is prominent in the reflection spectrum created by the hard X-ray continuum irradiating the dense accreting matter around a black hole. Here the presence of both iron K and L emission is reported in the spectrum of the active galaxy 1H 0707-495. There is a 'reverberation lag' with a timescale comparable to the light-crossing time of the innermost radii around a supermassive black hole. Since the 1995 discovery of the broad iron K-line emission from the Seyfert galaxy MCG–6-30-15 (ref. 1), broad iron K lines have been found in emission from several other Seyfert galaxies2, from accreting stellar-mass black holes3 and even from accreting neutron stars4. The iron K line is prominent in the reflection spectrum5,6 created by the hard-X-ray continuum irradiating dense accreting matter. Relativistic distortion7 of the line makes it sensitive to the strong gravity and spin of the black hole8. The accompanying iron L-line emission should be detectable when the iron abundance is high. Here we report the presence of both iron K and iron L emission in the spectrum of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy9 1H 0707-495. The bright iron L emission has enabled us to detect a reverberation lag of about 30 s between the direct X-ray continuum and its reflection from matter falling into the black hole. The observed reverberation timescale is comparable to the light-crossing time of the innermost radii around a supermassive black hole. The combination of spectral and timing data on 1H 0707-495 provides strong evidence that we are witnessing emission from matter within a gravitational radius, or a fraction of a light minute, from the event horizon of a rapidly spinning, massive black hole."
https://openalex.org/W2027265343,"Controlling Chronic Viral Infections Chronic viral infections such as HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses are major public health concerns. T cell—mediated immune responses are critical for controlling viral infections. In contrast to acute infections, chronic viral infections are characterized by “exhausted” cytotoxic CD8 + T cells, cells which exhibit reduced proliferative capacity, cytokine secretion, and cytotoxicity. Treatments that reverse exhaustion result in increased viral control. Despite their exhaustion, these CD8 + T cells eventually help to control chronic infections by killing virally infected cells, and require CD4 + T cell help to do so. How do CD4 + T cells provide help to CD8 + T cells during chronic infection (see the Perspective by Johnson and Jameson )? Elsaesser et al. (p. 1569 , published online 7 May), Yi et al. (p. 1572 , published online 14 May), and Fröhlich et al. (p. 1576 , published online 28 May) now show that the cytokine, interleukin-21 (IL-21), known to be critical for the differentiation of certain CD4 + T cell effector subsets, is an essential factor produced by CD4 + T cells that helps CD8 + T cells to control chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection in mice. Acute and chronic infections resulted in differing amounts of IL-21 production by virus-specific CD4 + T cells. CD8 + T cells required IL-21 directly, and when CD8 + T cells were unable to signal through IL-21 or IL-21 was not available, they were reduced in number, exhibited a more exhausted phenotype, and were not able to control the virus. In contrast, the absence of IL-21–dependent signaling did not affect primary CD8 + T cell responses to acute infection or responses to a viral rechallenge, suggesting that differentiation of memory CD8 + T cells is independent of IL-21."

(p. 1213 ) uncover an abundant source of gene expression variability in the promoters of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes. Up to 25% of yeast promoter regions contain a highly variable tandem repeat sequence, which effect gene expression and local chromatin structure. The intrinsic instability of these repeats generates variability in gene expression levels and provides a mechanism for rapid evolution of phenotypic traits."

However, the molecular mechanisms of barrier regulation are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that occludin phosphorylation and ubiquitination regulate VEGF-induced TJ protein trafficking and concomitant vascular permeability. VEGF treatment induced TJ fragmentation and occludin trafficking from the cell border to early and late endosomes, concomitant with increased occludin phosphorylation on Ser-490 and ubiquitination. Furthermore, both co-immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that VEGF treatment increased the interaction between occludin and modulators of intracellular trafficking that contain the ubiquitin interacting motif, including Epsin-1, epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 15 (Eps15), and hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs). Inhibiting occludin phosphorylation by mutating Ser-490 to Ala suppressed VEGF-induced ubiquitination, inhibited trafficking of TJ proteins, and prevented the increase in endothelial permeability. In addition, an occludin-ubiquitin chimera disrupted TJs and increased permeability without VEGF. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism of VEGF-induced occludin phosphorylation and ubiquitination that contributes to TJ trafficking and subsequent vascular permeability.

Under normal physiological conditions the blood-brain barrier and blood-retinal barrier regulate the transport of water, ions, amino acids, and waste products, between the neural parenchyma and blood (1Antonetti D.A.

Accumulating evidence suggests that a number of pathological eye diseases such as diabetes, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration, inflammation, and infectious diseases disrupt the TJs altering the blood-retinal barrier. Common mediators of vascular permeability and TJ deregulation are growth factors and cytokines that may induce macular edema and lead to loss of vision (1Antonetti D.A. Barber A.J. Bronson S.K. Freeman W.M. Gardner T.W. Jefferson L.S. Kester M. Kimball S.R. Krady J.K. LaNoue K.F. Norbury C.C. Quinn P.G. Sandirasegarane L. Simpson I.A. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 2401-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in particular, induces vascular permeability and stimulates angiogenesis, contributing to disease pathogenesis in diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity (3Aiello L.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 1647-1652PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF also contributes to blood-brain barrier disruption with subsequent edema and angiogenesis in brain tumors and stroke (4Machein M.R. Plate K.H. J. Neurooncol. 2000; 50: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Recent advances in biomedical research have provided therapeutic approaches to neutralize VEGF; however, these strategies have not yet demonstrated effective resolution of diabetic macular edema (5Gardner T.W.

Several transmembrane proteins including occludin, tricellulin, the claudin family, and junction adhesion molecules are thought to confer adhesion to the TJ barrier and to be organized by members of the zonula occludens family (ZO-1, -2, or -3) (7Hirase T. Staddon J.M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Itoh M. Furuse M. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. Rubin L.L. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Morita K. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Tsukita S.

Experimental evidence has established that the claudins confer barrier properties and claudin-5 specifically contributes to the vascular component of the blood-brain barrier demonstrated by gene deletion studies (10Nitta T. Hata M. Gotoh S. Seo Y. Sasaki H. Hashimoto N. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). In contrast, the function of occludin in paracellular flux has remained less clear. Mice with occludin gene deletion continue to form TJs in gut epithelia with normal barrier properties (11Saitou M. Furuse M. Sasaki H. Schulzke J.D. Fromm M. Takano H. Noda T. Tsukita S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4131-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). However, studies have also demonstrated that diabetes reduces occludin content in rat retina (12Antonetti D.A. Barber A.J. Khin S. Lieth E. Tarbell J.M. Gardner T.W. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1953-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and alters its distribution from continuous cell border localization to intracellular puncta (13Barber A.J. Antonetti D.A. Gardner T.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3561-3568PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the intracellular trafficking of TJ proteins promotes paracellular flux and vascular permeability in diabetic animals (12Antonetti D.A. Barber A.J. Khin S. Lieth E. Tarbell J.M. Gardner T.W. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1953-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 14Barber A.J. Antonetti D.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Science. 1983; 219: 983-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Both biological effects exacerbate the pathology of retinal vascular diseases (17Aiello L.P. Avery R.L. Arrigg P.G. Keyt B.A. Jampel H.D. Shah S.T. Pasquale L.R. Thieme H. Iwamoto M.A. Park J.E. Nguyen M.D. Aiello L.M. Ferrara N. King G.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar), and they are mediated via intracellular signal transduction, especially based on the phosphorylation of Src, protein kinase C, and so on (18Scheppke L. Aguilar E. Gariano R.F. Jacobson R. Hood J. Doukas J. Cao J. Noronha G. Yee S. Weis S. Martin M.B. Soll R. Cheresh D.A. Friedlander M. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2337-2346PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, VEGF treatment and diabetes induce occludin phosphorylation in rat retinal vasculature and endothelial cell culture coincident with increased permeability (19Antonetti D.A. Barber A.J. Hollinger L.A. Wolpert E.B. Gardner T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23463-23467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Recently, using mass spectrometry five occludin phosphorylation sites were identified in retinal endothelial cell culture after VEGF treatment (20Sundstrom J.M. Tash B.R. Murakami T. Flanagan J.M. Bewley M.C. Stanley B.A. Gonsar K.B. Antonetti D.A. J. Proteome Res. 2009; 8: 808-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Among these sites, phosphorylation at Ser-490 was shown to increase in response to VEGF treatment. However, no evidence has directly demonstrated the contribution of occludin phosphorylation to VEGF-induced endothelial permeability or defined the mechanism by which phosphorylation of occludin alters paracellular flux.Modification of proteins with monomeric or polymeric ubiquitin chains contributes to control of multiple biological functions including protein degradation, intracellular trafficking, translational regulation, and DNA repair (21Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Hofmann K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as epidermal growth factor receptor or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, is followed by ubiquitination and regulated trafficking to endosomes. This endocytosis process depends on the interaction between the ubiquitinated receptors and carrier proteins that possess a ubiquitin interacting motif (UIM) such as Epsin, epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 15 (Eps15), and hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) (21Di Fiore P.P.

Recent publications have demonstrated that occludin can be ubiquitinated targeting the protein for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system in epithelial cell types (25Traweger A. Fang D.

Cell. Physiol. 2005; 203: 564-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation of occludin at Ser-490 is necessary for occludin ubiquitination in response to VEGF in endothelial cells. Furthermore, the ubiquitination promotes interaction of occludin with UIM containing modulators of trafficking and regulates the internalization of TJ proteins altering endothelial permeability. Together, these results suggest that occludin phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination are necessary for VEGF-induced TJ trafficking and endothelial permeability.DISCUSSIONVEGF potently induces vascular permeability in most organ systems including the retina (16Senger D.R.

Both paracellular and transcellular routes of flux have been demonstrated as mechanisms of VEGF-induced permeability (2Harhaj N.S. Antonetti D.A. Int. J. Biochem.

Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although phenomenological changes in the junctional complex have been characterized suggesting increased paracellular transport, a detailed molecular mechanism of TJ regulation in response to VEGF has only begun to be elucidated. Recent publications have demonstrated that the internalization and trafficking of junctional proteins contribute to the increase in paracellular flux in several cell lines (35Ivanov A.I. Nusrat A. Parkos C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 36Matsuda M. Kubo A. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J.

In vascular endothelial cells, the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin is phosphorylated and internalized, which promotes VEGF-induced permeability (38Gavard J. Gutkind J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism in which phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination of occludin regulates VEGF-induced TJ disruption and vascular permeability in retinal vascular endothelial cells.TJs are composed of both transmembrane adhesive proteins and scaffolding proteins and a number of regulatory proteins also localize to TJs (2Harhaj N.S. Antonetti D.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1206-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 9Matter K. Balda M.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The contribution to barrier properties has been clearly demonstrated for the transmembrane protein family, the claudins (10Nitta T. Hata M. Gotoh S. Seo Y. Sasaki H. Hashimoto N. Furuse M. Tsukita S.

Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 181-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), whereas the function of another transmembrane protein, occludin, has been ill-defined. Occludin was originally predicted to confer barrier properties to TJs (7Hirase T. Staddon J.M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Itoh M. Furuse M. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. Rubin L.L. J.

However, there are many reports demonstrating that occludin contributes to or is altered in several pathological conditions (12Antonetti D.A. Barber A.J. Khin S. Lieth E. Tarbell J.M. Gardner T.W. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1953-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 42Dallasta L.M. Pisarov L.A. Esplen J.E. Werley J.V. Moses A.V. Nelson J.A. Achim C.L. Am. J.

These contradictory data led us to ask whether occludin confers barrier properties to paracellular flux per se or provides a regulatory function in the junctional complex. The results of our current study demonstrate a novel role for occludin in the regulation of paracellular permeability in endothelial cells with TJs, such as in the blood-brain barrier or blood-retinal barrier.Evidence for both occludin phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation have previously been demonstrated (19Antonetti D.A.

However, the mechanisms by which these modifications influence intracellular trafficking of TJ proteins, especially during VEGF-induced endothelial permeability, have not been elucidated. We now demonstrate that phosphorylation of occludin at Ser-490 in response to VEGF allows its ubiquitination, which leads to interaction with UIM containing proteins, Epsin-1, Eps15, and Hrs, promoting clathrin-mediated endocytosis and trafficking to endosomes. Importantly, mutational analysis of occludin preventing phosphorylation at Ser-490 demonstrates that occludin phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination regulates the endocytosis of TJ proteins claudin-5 and ZO-1 in addition to occludin and controls endothelial permeability.It is noteworthy that the intracellular puncta of occludin and claudin-5 (or ZO-1) appeared different after VEGF treatment compared with transfection of the occludin-ubiquitin chimera. This difference suggests that the chimeric protein is delayed in a specific trafficking compartment. Previous studies have demonstrated unique endocytosis pathways for TJ and adherens junction proteins (35Ivanov A.I. Nusrat A. Parkos C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) dependent on rab13 and rab8, respectively (45Yamamura R. Nishimura N. Nakatsuji H. Arase S. Sasaki T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The studies presented here demonstrate a coordination of occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1 endocytosis to endosomes after VEGF treatment but the mechanisms that control targeting of occludin for degradation whereas claudin-5 is spared for potential recycling remains to be determined.Recently, it was demonstrated that creating a phosphomimetic of Ser-490, S490D, does not affect the structure of the occludin coiled-coil domain but alters the charge distribution and reduces ZO-1 interaction (20Sundstrom J.M.

Lavie A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the current study, we demonstrate that phosphorylation at Ser-490 is necessary for VEGF-induced occludin ubiquitination. The critical steps for ubiquitination depend on the interaction between substrates and their E3 ligases. The first publication about the binding of occludin and its E3 ligase, Itch, showed that the amine terminus of occludin interacts directly with Itch (25Traweger A. Fang D. Liu Y.C. Stelzhammer W. Krizbai I.A. Fresser F. Bauer H.C. Bauer H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10201-10208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The amine terminus of occludin contains a PPYP sequence that interacts with the WW domain of Itch. Our data demonstrated the necessity of Ser-490 phosphorylation for Itch binding and occludin ubiquitination. It is unclear at this time how Ser-490 phosphorylation of occludin in the carboxyl terminus allows Itch binding in the amine terminus, but several possibilities may explain this phosphorylation-ubiquitination sequence. Phosphorylation at Ser-490 might decrease the interaction between occludin and other proteins, including ZO-1, exposing occludin to the E3 ligase. In addition, other phosphorylation sites on occludin or Itch may be essential for this process in conjunction with phosphorylation at Ser-490 (47Gao M. Labuda T. Xia Y. Gallagher E. Fang D. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Science. 2004; 306: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Ser-490 phosphorylation may increase the binding to ancillary proteins that promote Itch interaction and ubiquitination. The time course of occludin-Itch interaction is relatively longer compared with the ubiquitination and phosphorylation of occludin suggesting these additional molecular mechanisms should be considered along with the requirement of Ser-490 phosphorylation. Finally, deubiquitinating enzymes as well as occludin-Itch interaction may regulate the amount of ubiquitinated occludin.In this study, both immunocytochemistry and biochemical analyses were used to demonstrate that VEGF increases occludin ubiquitination and endocytosis leading to ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. We speculate that the interaction between ubiquitinated occludin and Epsin-1 or Eps15 likely occurs via UIM, which subsequently promotes endocytosis (21Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Hofmann K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Likewise, occludin binds to the UIM containing protein Hrs, which also contributes to endosomal trafficking (24Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Gillooly D.J. Madshus I.H. Stang E. Stenmark H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 32Barriere H. Nemes C. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3952-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recent publications have demonstrated a role of mono-, poly-, or multiple monoubiquitination in trafficking and interaction with Epsin-1 and Eps15 (31Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M.

Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1246-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation with Epsin-1 or Eps15 demonstrated a ∼66-kDa occludin band that co-precipitated after VEGF treatment suggesting monoubiquitination of occludin because the molecular mass of occludin was originally reported to be ∼58 kDa (40Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar). Although we could not find evidence of polyubiquitinated occludin interacting with Epsin and Eps15, this possibility cannot be excluded because polyubiquitinated bands often present as a smear that may be difficult to detect in Western blotting. It remains to be determined whether mono-, poly-, or multiple monoubiquitination of occludin induces endocytic trafficking. Furthermore, the sequence of events that direct proteasomal degradation versus potential occludin recycling to the membrane has not yet been identified.In our studies, overexpression of the OccS490A mutant dominated the endogenous occludin in regulation of TJ protein trafficking and endothelial permeability in response to VEGF. The precise mechanism by which the alanine mutation dominates remains to be determined but we speculate that the mutant interferes with the ability to recruit clathrin-mediated endocytosis-related proteins to TJs because the mutation prevents occludin ubiquitination. Furthermore, trafficking of TJs likely requires the contribution of additional TJ protein modifications or interactions with other modulators of endocytosis. Finally, transfection of Occ-Ub and S490A-Ub chimeras increased permeability without VEGF treatment suggesting that the occludin phosphorylation-ubiquitination sequence regulates TJ trafficking and that occludin ubiquitination is sufficient to confer barrier disruption and permeability. Ser-490 phosphorylation may also contribute to additional mechanisms regulating vascular permeability because the S490A-Ub chimera demonstrated less permeability than Occ-Ub in macromolecular tracer experiments.Many studies have demonstrated a correlation of occludin content with permeability. Earlier studies of occludin overexpression in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells increased mannitol flux, whereas electrical resistance was also increased (51Balda M.S. Whitney J.A. Flores C. González S. Cereijido M. Matter K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1031-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that overexpression of WtOcc did not reduce permeability, but, in fact, significantly increased VEGF-induced permeability to 70-kDa dextran. These data support a model in which the amount of ubiquitinated occludin determines TJ disruption and vascular permeability rather than loss of occludin per se. Furthermore, this model suggests that occludin degradation acts as a negative feedback system for TJ integrity. Therefore, the content of occludin detected at the traditional 58 kDa correlates with barrier properties because occludin ubiquitination reduces the observed band at this molecular weight, induces TJ disruption, and over time leads to occludin degradation in endothelial cells. It is important to note that we failed to detect evidence of occludin ubiquitination in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (data not shown) suggesting that occludin ubiquitination may be cell-type specific or limited to the VEGF response.In conclusion, we demonstrate that VEGF induces phosphorylation-dependent occludin ubiquitination, which is necessary for increased permeability to both macromolecules and ions. These studies demonstrate a role for occludin in regulation of endothelial barrier properties and suggest important potential therapeutic targets for the control of vascular permeability in diseases of the blood-brain and blood-retinal barrier. Under normal physiological conditions the blood-brain barrier and blood-retinal barrier regulate the transport of water, ions, amino acids, and waste products, between the neural parenchyma and blood (1Antonetti D.A.

https://openalex.org/W2151805592,"Stepping Back to Go Forward Insight into the mechanism of transcription has come from crystal structures of actively transcribing RNA polymerase II complexes in the pre- and posttranslocation states. RNA polymerase also backtracks on the DNA template. Backtracking by only a few residues is reversible, but longer backtracking leads to arrest that is relieved by cleavage of the transcript by the transcription elongation factor SII (TFIIS). Now Wang et al. (p. 1203 ) report x-ray structures of backtracked ternary complexes and of a backtracked complex bound to a noncleaving mutant of TFIIS. The structures show a defined one-residue, backtracked state supporting the idea that RNA polymerase oscillates between backward and forward motion during active transcription. Mismatched residues disfavor forward translocation, increasing the lifetime of the backtracked state and facilitating cleavage by TFIIS. Thus, TFIIS-induced cleavage is likely to provide an important proofreading function during transcription."

https://openalex.org/W2045442669,"In mammals, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT-1) constitute a nuclear NAD(+) salvage pathway which regulates the functions of NAD(+)-dependent enzymes such as the protein deacetylase SIRT1. One of the major functions of SIRT1 is to regulate target gene transcription through modification of chromatin-associated proteins. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which NAD(+) biosynthetic enzymes regulate SIRT1 activity to control gene transcription in the nucleus. In this study we show that stable short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of NAMPT or NMNAT-1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells reduces total cellular NAD(+) levels and alters global patterns of gene expression. Furthermore, we show that SIRT1 plays a key role in mediating the gene regulatory effects of NAMPT and NMNAT-1. Specifically, we found that SIRT1 binds to the promoters of genes commonly regulated by NAMPT, NMNAT-1, and SIRT1 and that SIRT1 histone deacetylase activity is regulated by NAMPT and NMNAT-1 at these promoters. Most significantly, NMNAT-1 interacts with, and is recruited to target gene promoters by SIRT1. Collectively, our results reveal a mechanism for the direct control of SIRT1 deacetylase activity at a set of target gene promoters by NMNAT-1. This mechanism, in collaboration with NAMPT-dependent regulation of nuclear NAD(+) production, establishes an important pathway for transcription regulation by NAD(+)."

Yet, the neural mechanisms that shape these strategies and their implementation remain largely unknown. Using an economic decision-making task, we dissociate brain regions that predict specific choices from those predicting an individual's preferred strategy. Choices that maximized gains or minimized losses were predicted by functional magnetic resonance imaging activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex or anterior insula, respectively. However, choices that followed a simplifying strategy (i.e., attending to overall probability of winning) were associated with activation in parietal and lateral prefrontal cortices. Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, through differential functional connectivity with parietal and insular cortex, predicted individual variability in strategic preferences. Finally, we demonstrate that robust decision strategies follow from neural sensitivity to rewards. We conclude that decision making reflects more than compensatory interaction of choice-related regions; in addition, specific brain systems potentiate choices depending on strategies, traits, and context."

However, the specific immunological relevance of individual mAb-associated N-glycan structures is currently largely unknown, because of the heterogeneous N-glycan profiles of mAbs when produced in mammalian cells. Here we report on the generation of a plant-based expression platform allowing the efficient production of mAbs with a homogeneous beta1,4-galactosylated N-glycosylation structure, the major N-glycan species present on serum IgG. This was achieved by the expression of a highly active modified version of the human beta1,4-galactosyltransferase in glycoengineered plants lacking plant-specific glycosylation. Moreover, we demonstrate that two anti-human immunodeficiency virus mAbs with fully beta1,4-galactosylated N-glycans display improved virus neutralization potency when compared with other glycoforms produced in plants and Chinese hamster ovary cells. These findings indicate that mAbs containing such homogeneous N-glycan structures should display improved in vivo activities. Our system, using expression of mAbs in tobacco plants engineered for post-translational protein processing, provides a new means of overcoming the two hurdles that limit the therapeutic use of anti-human immunodeficiency virus mAbs in global health initiatives, low biological potency and high production costs."
https://openalex.org/W2005553870,"It's nearly 400 years since Galileo first observed the changing phases of Venus, revealing the geometry of the Solar System. Now the first optical observations of the phases of an extrasolar planet — the hot Jupiter CoRoT-1b — are reported. CoRoT-1b was the first planet discovered by the CoRoT (COnvection ROtation and planetary Transits) satellite, and analysis of optical photometric data from the same satellite, representing 36 planetary orbits, now shows the permanent nightside hemisphere of the planet to be entirely black. The dayside flux, reflecting a small proportion of the incident stellar light, dominates the optical phase curve. This means that at optical wavelengths the planet's phase variation resembles what we see for the interior planets in the Solar System. Hot Jupiters are a class of extrasolar planet that orbit their parent stars at very short distances and are expected to be tidally locked, which can lead to a large temperature difference between the dayside and the nightside. Here, the day–night contrast of the transiting extrasolar planet HD 188733b is 'mapped' using infrared observations; the data are consistent with the nightside hemisphere being entirely black, with the dayside flux dominating the optical phase curve.

Physiol. 1942; : 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Studies using the model species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have shown that H2 generation stems from the use of two oxygen (O2) sensitive Fe-hydrogenase enzymes, HydA1 and HydA2, that use reduced ferredoxin to catalyze the reduction of protons to yield H2 (4.Happe T.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 2750-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The electrons for the reduction of ferredoxin that is used in H2 production can come from endogenous substrates or from water oxidation (6.Stuart T.S. Gaffron H. Planta. 1972; 106: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 7.Melis A. Planta. 2007; 226: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). H2 production was originally studied by making algal cultures anaerobic by purging with inert gases or by incubation in the dark and then exposure to light (3.Gaffron H. Rubin J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1942; : 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 8.Gfeller R.P. Gibbs M. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 212-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H2 was produced during these experiments in small amounts and for a relatively short period of time. More recently, a method of sulfur depletion was devised in which cells are resuspended in sulfur-depleted medium, allowing H2 production to be observed for numerous days and in larger quantities (9.Melis A. Zhang L. Forestier M. Ghirardi M.L. Seibert M. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). By depleting a sealed culture of sulfur, photosynthetic O2 evolution decreases and it becomes microxic, leading to anaerobic pathways becoming operative and to the onset of H2 production. It is proposed that sulfur depletion preferentially limits synthesis of the D1 protein of photosystem II (9.Melis A. Zhang L. Forestier M. Ghirardi M.L. Seibert M. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Sulfur depletion has to date proven to be the best procedure for inducing H2 production in terms of volume and purity. Sulfur is transported into C. reinhardtii cells primarily as the sulfate anion, SO42−, and is required for a variety of lipids, proteins, and metabolites (10.Pollock S.V. Pootakham W. Shibagaki N. Moseley J.L. Grossman A.R. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 86: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Microarray studies have been performed on C. reinhardtii following transfer to sulfur-free medium (11.Zhang Z. Shrager J. Jain M. Chang C.W. Vallon O. Grossman A.R. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 1331-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and in a sulfur-deplete anaerobic environment in which H2 production was observed (12.Nguyen A.V. Thomas-Hall S.R. Malnoë A. Timmins M. Mussgnug J.H. Rupprecht J. Kruse O. Hankamer B. Schenk P.M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 1965-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In both studies, extensive changes in transcript abundance were observed, with over 20% of analyzed transcripts showing a change of greater than 2-fold, many of them with putative or unknown functions. Both studies showed sulfur depletion to lead to a general increase in transcripts involved in sulfur assimilation, protein degradation and stress, a decrease in most transcripts encoding components of the photosynthetic apparatus, a decrease in transcripts for carbon metabolism through the Calvin-Benson cycle, an increase in those of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle, and an increase in those of starch synthesis. Key additional observations made in work by Ngyuen et al. (12.Nguyen A.V. Thomas-Hall S.R. Malnoë A. Timmins M. Mussgnug J.H. Rupprecht J. Kruse O. Hankamer B. Schenk P.M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 1965-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) showed that the added effect of anaerobicity led to repression of genes of the glyoxylate cycle, an up-regulation of the major light harvesting complex Lhcbm9 protein and transcript, hydrogenase-encoding transcripts HydA1, HydA2, and HydEF, and an up-regulation of genes of fermentative pathways. The up-regulation of genes of fermentative pathways and hydrogenase-encoding transcripts are key processes that C. reinhardtii employs to respond to anaerobic conditions. However, these are not the sole processes, and it has been shown that there is a “whole cell” response such that hundreds to thousands of genes are regulated to deal with anoxic conditions. Analysis of the genome of C. reinhardtii has shown a large number of peptides to be involved in anaerobic metabolism (13.Grossman A.R. Croft M. Gladyshev V.N. Merchant S.S. Posewitz M.C. Prochnik S. Spalding M.H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2007; 10: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and microarray analysis has revealed over 500 transcripts involved in diverse processes such as transcription/translation regulators, prolylhydroxylases, hybrid cluster proteins, proteases, transhydrogenases, and catalases to be up-regulated by the onset of anoxia (14.Mus F. Dubini A. Seibert M. Posewitz M.C. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25475-25486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It is clear that photosynthetic organisms respond to anoxia by adopting an integrated response rather than activating or inactivating only a few select pathways. To better understand the response of C. reinhardtii to sulfur depletion and to anoxia as well as how such responses underpin H2 production, we undertook detailed metabolomic studies of C. reinhardtii.

Anaerobic H2 production conditions were achieved by the method of sulfur depletion as reported by Melis et al. (9.Melis A. Zhang L. Forestier M. Ghirardi M.L. Seibert M. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). In brief, cultures of C. reinhardtii Stm6 (15.Schönfeld C. Wobbe L. Borgstädt R. Kienast A. Nixon P.J. Kruse O. J. Biol.

The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 780Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended to a density of 15 × 106 cells/ml in sulfur-depleted TAP medium (pH 7.3) and sealed in 600-ml conical flasks fitted with gas collection tubes. Cultures were exposed to 500 μE·m−2·s−1 continuous white light and stirred with magnetic stirrers at 150 rpm. Dissolved O2 concentration, H2 gas evolution, and pH of the cultures were monitored for 120 h post sulfur depletion. Samples were taken for metabolomic analysis at 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h post sulfur depletion. For GC/MS analyses, 6 samples were taken at each time point (3 biological × 2 technical replicates). For NMR analyses, 16 samples were taken at each time point (4 biological × 4 technical replicates). In addition, analysis by NMR required the removal of Tris from the growth medium, so TAP medium was modified so that Tris was replaced with high concentrations of phosphate (NaH2PO4·H2O, 2.33 g l−1 and Na2HPO4, 3.27 g l−1) and acetate concentration was set at 15 mm; all other conditions were kept identical. Dissolved O2 concentrations and pH of algal cultures were measured every 5 min using a D130 data logger system with SZ10T DO and SP11X pH electrodes (Consort, Belgium). Gas composition was measured by extraction with a Hamilton gas-tight syringe and injection into an Agilent Micro GC3000 gas chromatograph fitted with a PlotU pre-column (3 m × 0.32 mm) and MolSieve 5APlot column (10 m × 0.32 mm). Argon (32.5 p.s.i.) was used as the carrier gas. Algal culture (1 ml) was removed from the bioreactor side-port with a gas-tight lockable syringe and immediately immersed in a beaker full of boiling water for 3 min to inactivate enzyme activity. Cell culture was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and cellular debris was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 3 min. For NMR analysis, 500 μl of the supernatant solution was transferred to an NMR tube, and 50 μl of D2O was added. Algal culture (2 ml) was transferred to a pre-chilled microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed once with 32.5% (v/v) methanol kept at −20 °C. 500 μl of 100% (v/v) methanol supplemented with 2 μg of ribitol for sample normalization was added to the pellet. Metabolite extraction was performed by 15 min of shaking in a thermomixer (1,200 rpm) at 70 °C. Cell debris was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min, and 100 μl of the supernatant solution was dried in a vacuum evaporator for 3 h. Dried samples were derivatized by the addition of 20 μl of a 20 mg/ml solution of methoxylamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) in pyridine (30 °C for 90 min). 30 μl of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) was then added and shaken for a further 30 min at 37 °C. 10 μl of an alkane standard mix containing 50 ng each of C12, C15, C19, C22, C28, C32, and C36 in chloroform was added for retention index determination. To enhance the signal of amino acids for GC/MS analysis, cell extracts were derivatized with the agent N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MBTSTFA), which generates higher signals than MSTFA for the amino acids. Its use permits molecular formula determination of the quantifier ion from spectral analysis and allows for calculation of isotopic signal contribution of unlabeled metabolites toward the labeled pool. For amino acid analysis, dried samples were derivatized with 20 μl of a 20 mg/ml solution of methoxylamine hydrochloride at 30 °C for 90 min. 20 μl of MBTSTFA was then added, and samples were shaken (750 rpm) at 85 °C for 60 min. No other compounds were added. Table 1 lists the amino acids that could be identified that generated both labeled (15N) and unlabeled (14N) signals and shows the molecular formula of the quantifier ion (Q-ion) as well as the theoretical isotopic contribution of the unlabeled component toward the labeled component.TABLE 1Molecular formula of ions used for quantification of labeled and unlabeled amino acidsMetaboliteQ-ion molecular formula14N Q-ion15N Q-ionIsotope % contributionAlanineSi2C11H26NO226026123AspartateSi3C18H40NO441841936GlutamateSi3C19H43N2O343243338GlycineSi2C10H24NO224624722IsoleucineSi2C14H32NO230230327LeucineSi2C14H32NO230230326LysineSi3C20H42N3O243143318PhenylalanineSi2C17H30NO233633730ProlineSiC8H14NO218418515SerineSi3C17H40NO339039135ThreonineSi3C18H42NO340440536TyrosineSi3C23H44NO346646742ValineSi2C11H26NO226026123 Open table in a new tab Samples were randomized, and 1 μl of derivatized sample was injected splitless into an Agilent 6890 GC fitted with an Agilent 5975 MSD. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow of 1 ml/min. Inlet temperature was set at 300 °C. Oven temperature was initially set at 70 °C for 1 min, ramped at 1 °C/min until 76 °C, then ramped at 6 °C/min until 325 °C, with a final hold of 10 min. A Varian Factor 4 capillary column (VF-5ms, 30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm plus 10 m EZ-Guard) was used. The MSD transfer line heater was kept at 300 °C. MS quadrupole temperature was kept at 150 °C and source temperature at 230 °C. Mass detection range was set from 40 to 600 atomic mass units. Spectral data files were processed with AMDIS (version 2.65) for metabolite identification. Metabolites were identified by retention index and spectral comparison to pre-run standards or by searching the NIST library (indicated with asterisks). All identified metabolites were entered into MSD ChemStation (version E.02.00.493), and a quantitation data base was created using specific target ions and qualifier ions unique to each metabolite. All spectra were manually reviewed. Normalization was performed to the internal standard ribitol and to the cell number. High resolution proton NMR spectroscopy was performed on a 500-MHz spectrometer (Avance 500, Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). Standard one-dimensional 1H Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill spectra with 0.5-ms T2 spin echo time and water presaturation during the relaxation delay were recorded with 512 scans. Fourier transformation was performed, and all 1H NMR spectra were manually phased and baseline-corrected using TOPSPIN (Bruker Biospin, Karlsruhe, Germany). Chemical shift referencing was performed on the formate peak at 8.44 ppm. Data analysis was carried out using the program AMIX (version 3.6.8, Bruker Biospin). The chemical shift region from 0.2 to 9.0 ppm of each NMR spectrum was divided into buckets (spectral integral regions) of 0.04-ppm width. Integral intensities were normalized to the total intensity of the regions examined for each spectrum. The resulting bucket tables were used without further scaling for principal component analysis with the multivariate data analysis program Pirouette (version 4, Infometrix). Metabolites were identified based on chemical shift peak similarities to standards in public databases. Relative abundances were calculated from spectral integrals. Algal cultures (2 ml) were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 3 min, the supernatant solution was discarded, and the pellets were washed with 1 ml of 100% methanol (v/v) and 1 ml of sodium acetate buffer (100 mm, pH 4.8) consecutively. The pellets were re-suspended in 500 μl of sodium acetate buffer and autoclaved (15 min 120 °C) for starch solubilization. Starch was hydrolyzed by incubation with 50 units of amyloglucosidase (Sigma-Aldrich) at 60 °C overnight. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 3 min), and 500 μl of the supernatant solution was taken for glucose analysis via NMR. Glucose concentration was calculated based on integral comparisons to standards and converted to starch mass. Algal culture (2 ml) was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 3 min. Non-polar lipids were extracted from the pellet by the separate addition of 400 μl of methanol, 400 μl of chloroform, and 400 μl of water. Samples were sonicated in a water bath for 20 min and vortexed between methanol and chloroform additions. Phase separation was performed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min, and 200 μl of the chloroform layer was taken and dried in a vacuum evaporator. Samples were resuspended to a volume of 20 μl in chloroform, and 3 μl was loaded onto a 10-cm × 10-cm HPTLC-HL normal phase silica gel plate (Analtech); the plate was developed in an 80:20:2 hexane:ether:acetic acid running buffer. The plate was dried thoroughly (using a hair dryer) and sprayed with 80% (v/v) acetone supplemented with 0.5 mg liter−1 primuline (Sigma-Aldrich). Once again the plate was dried, and stained lipids were visualized under UV illumination. Algal cultures (2 ml) were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant solution was discarded, and the pellets were hydrolyzed and methyl-esterified by shaking (1,200 rpm) with 300 μl of a 49:1 100% methanol (v/v):18 m H2SO4 solution for 2 h at 80 °C; 100 μg of nonadecanoic acid was added as internal standard. 300 μl of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl and 300 μl of hexane was then added, and the mixture was sonicated for 20 min and vortexed. Phase separation was performed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 3 min. 1 μl of the hexane layer was injected into an Agilent 6890 GC fitted with a 5975 MSD. A DB-Wax column (Agilent, 122-7032) was used with running conditions as described for Agilent's RTL DB-Wax method. Fatty acid methyl esters were quantified using the area of the total ion current compared with that of the internal standard. Identification of fatty acid methyl esters was based on mass spectral profiles, comparison to standards, and expected retention time from Agilent's RTL method and verified by comparison to those previously described in C. reinhardtii by Poerschmann et al. (17.Poerschmann J. Spijkerman E. Langer U. Microb. Ecol. 2004; 48: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For metabolic profiling, photobiological H2 production was induced in C. reinhardtii by sulfur depletion. H2 production, pH, and O2 levels were continuously measured through 120 h of sulfur depletion (Fig. 1). Samples for metabolic profiling were taken at 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h post re-suspension of C. reinhardtii culture in sulfur-depleted medium. TAP medium was used for culture cultivation, but for NMR analysis it was necessary to replace Tris with phosphate buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”) resulting in a 50% reduction of H2 production; H2 initiation, peak production, and termination times matched to within 10% of those in TAP medium, as did pH and dissolved O2 levels (data not shown). Once C. reinhardtii cells were subjected to sulfur depletion there was an initial increase in the dissolved O2 concentration and pH of the growth medium. After ∼12 h, the dissolved O2 concentration began to drop rapidly and the culture became anoxic at ∼20 h. The pH began to decline once anoxic conditions were reached. At ∼24 h, H2 could be measured in the gas collection tube above the bioreactors. H2 production rates peaked at ∼4.5 ml of H2/h/liter of culture at 48 h after sulfur depletion and then declined steadily until 120 h, at which point H2 production rates were below 0.3 ml H2/h/liter. Peak H2 production rates coincided with a drop of pH from 7.9 to 7.6. In vitro studies have shown hydrogenase activity to be optimal in the pH range of 7.0–7.4 but still maintain high activity up to pH 8.0 (18.Kosourov S. Seibert M. Ghirardi M.L. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The decline in pH could potentially increase hydrogenase activity but may also affect other facets of metabolism that control rates of H2 production. For NMR analysis a hot culture medium extraction was performed. This procedure extracted metabolites from the cells into the medium, so both the extracellular and internal metabolomes were analyzed as a whole. This extraction procedure resulted predominantly in analysis of the extracellular metabolome. However, preliminary experiments indicated that, for the compounds detected by NMR, the extracellular and intracellular metabolomes were very similar, but the cells contributed only 5–10% to the total (data not shown). Because it proved difficult to rapidly isolate cells in sufficient quantity under anaerobic conditions, we analyzed the unfractionated culture. Samples were taken for NMR analysis at 24-h intervals over 120 h of sulfur-depleted H2 production. Generated spectra were integrated over 0.04-ppm regions, and principal component analysis was performed to reduce the number of variables in the data set and to isolate those that contributed most to metabolic variance (Fig. 2). Data base searching of chemical shifts that contributed to variance allowed the positive identification of seven metabolites; their changes in abundance are shown in Fig. 3. Starch concentration was determined separately following digestion to glucose.FIGURE 3Changes in relative abundance of metabolites during 120 h of sulfur depletion. Standard error bars from 16 replicates (4 biological × 4 technical) are shown. Starch concentrations were calculated from four biological replicates in independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of the scores plot from the first two principal components revealed that the largest changes occurred during the first 24 h. This is largely attributable to the consumption of acetate during this period, which is the key contributor to metabolic variance throughout the time course. The consumption of acetate was fastest during the first 24 h then progressively slowed until 72 h; after that its concentration increased marginally. The grouping of samples in the scores plot reflects this trend, and it is interesting to note the reversal of movement along principal component 1 between 72 and 120 h, likely a result of an overall production of acetate in this period, notably when H2 is still being produced. The fermentation products ethanol and formate were the next largest contributors to spectral variance. These products increased steadily once anoxic conditions were reached. Succinate and alanine also responded in a manner similar to ethanol and formate. Their abundances steadily increased throughout the time course. Glutamate decreased to approximately half its abundance in the first 24 h and continued to decline slowly until 96 h, at which point it remained at a steady level. Glycerate and starch were seen to increase in the first 24 h and then declined steadily until the end of the time course. Using GC/MS, the metabolome of C. reinhardtii was analyzed at 24-h intervals over 120 h of sulfur depletion. In addition, samples were taken immediately prior to washing and re-suspending cells in sulfur-depleted medium. Using a hot methanol extraction, ∼200 putative metabolites could be detected, of which 43 were identified. Relative abundances of these metabolites are shown in Table 2.TABLE 2Relative abundances of metabolites from C. reinhardtii following 120 h of sulphur depletion Open table in a new tab Following re-suspension of cells in sulfur-depleted medium (see columns S+ and 0), a number of metabolites changed in abundance, particularly polar metabolites. The process of re-suspension takes ∼2 h and has two likely consequences. First, there were three wash steps employed so that leakage of metabolites during this step is expected; this is likely responsible for the decrease in abundance noted for many metabolites. Second, stress to the cells from the wash and centrifugation steps is likely to result in changes in metabolism. These factors are probably key to the observed increase in abundance for particular metabolites such as tricarboxylic acid intermediates and glutamate. GC/MS analysis performed during this work was semiquantitative, and as such no molar amounts have been deduced. However, from analysis of total ion current chromatograms, it should be noted that amino acids were low in abundance compared with most other metabolites. Of the amino acids, serine, glycine, alanine, lysine, and glutamate gave the highest signal, followed by isoleucine, valine, tyrosine, and threonine. Leucine and phenylalanine gave very low signals and proline, aspartate, cysteine, and methionine were only just detectable. The results establish that the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine decline in amount following transfer to sulfur-depleted medium. With the exception of glutamate, other amino acids generally increased in amount following the onset of anaerobic conditions. The general trend was for abundance to increase between 0 and 72 h and then decline in the last 48 h of sulfur depletion. Alanine was the exception to this trend, which peaked at 24 h. This result is contrary to that seen via NMR analysis, in which alanine continually increased until the end of the time course. Because NMR analysis was performed on aliquots of whole culture, whereas GC/MS analysis was performed on cells isolated from culture medium, it implies that alanine is released into the medium during the time course. This same effect was noted for succinate, and it appears that the release of these metabolites into the media is a strategy C. reinhardtii employs to cope with anaerobic stress. Similar to the response observed for most amino acids, sugars and sugar alcohols increased in abundance upon anaerobiosis. Levels typically peaked at 24 or 48 h of anaerobiosis and then declined toward the end of the experiment. Tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates all decreased from 24 to 120 h of sulfur depletion, but with an exception for succinate, which is believed to show an intracellular decrease and an extracellular increase. As observed from GC/MS total ion current signal generation, the most abundant sterols in C. reinhardtii were ergosterol, ergost-7-enol, and stigmasta-5,7,22-trienol. Ergosterol and stigmasta-5,7,22-trienol showed little change during the first 72 h of anaerobiosis but declined toward the end of the time course. These two sterols are known to be relatively stable metabolic end products, but the appearance of sterol esters during later stages of the experiment (Fig. 5) suggests that they may have been modified by esterification. The other major sterol in C. reinhardtii, ergost-7-enol, increased in abundance throughout the assay with a peak at 96 h. Ergost-7-enol can theoretically be converted to stigmasta-5,7,22-trienol via a methyltransferase reaction that would require S-adenosyl methionine. Methionine is a sulfur-containing amino acid, and its abundance was reduced during sulfur depletion. The lack of sulfur may cause the increase in ergost-7-enol due to an inability for it to be further processed. Maintenance of membrane selectivity and integrity has been postulated to be a key priority for cells suffering anoxia (19.Greenway H. Gibbs J. Funct. Plant Biol. 2003; 30: 999-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Loss of these functions can result in leakage of molecules and ions and movement of destructive proteins such as proteases and lipases through membranes and sub-cellular compartments. The modes of action of these sterols toward increased fitness under anaerobic conditions are not understood but are hypothesized to be important in maintenance of membrane integrity. Analysis of the metabolome of C. reinhardtii during sulfur-depleted H2 production revealed that amino acids play a dominant role in adaptive responses. The roles of amino acids are not clear, and their rates of change could be a result of a c"
https://openalex.org/W1967701730,"GLUT4, Clathrin, and Glucose In human muscle, the GLUT4 glucose transport pathway responds to insulin and is responsible for 70 to 90% of human glucose clearance. In the basal metabolic state, GLUT4 is sequestered away from the cell surface and is released from an intracellular membrane compartment in response to insulin. This GLUT4 membrane pathway is defective in type II diabetes. Vassilopoulos et al. (p. 1192 ; see the Perspective by Orme and Bogan ) now describe a function for CHC22 clathrin, a second isoform of clathrin that is present in humans and not in mice. CHC22 participates in the biogenesis of the intracellular compartment that sequesters the GLUT4 glucose transporter for insulin-stimulated release. Because CHC22 is restricted to humans, mice differ in their pathways that control glucose metabolism, which may restrict the utility of the mouse as a model system in assessing glucose metabolism and diabetes."

Characterization of the bisretinoids A2E and the all-trans-retinal dimer series has shown that these pigments form from reactions in photoreceptor cell outer segments that involve all-trans-retinal, the product of photoisomerization of the visual chromophore 11-cis-retinal. Here we have identified two related but previously unknown RPE lipofuscin compounds.

The second pigment, A2-dihydropyridine-eth a nol amine, forms from phosphate hydrolysis of A2-DHP-PE. The structure of A2-DHP-PE was corroborated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory confirmed the presence of a dihydropyridine ring. This lipofuscin pigment is a fluorescent compound with absorbance maxima at ∼490 and 330 nm, and it was identified in human, mouse, and bovine eyes. We found that A2-DHP-PE forms in reaction mixtures of all-trans-retinal and phosphatidyleth a nol amine, and in mouse eyecups we observed an age-related accumulation. As compared with wild-type mice, A2-DHP-PE is more abundant in mice with a null mutation in Abca4 (ATP-binding cassette transporter 4), the gene causative for recessive Stargardt macular degeneration.

A2E formation begins in photoreceptor outer segments when atRAL, instead of being reduced to all-trans-retinol, reacts with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in a 2:1 ratio. Although the double bonds along the side arms of A2E are all in the trans (E) position, Z-isomers of A2E have double bonds at the C-13/14 (isoA2E), C-9/9′-10/10′, and C-11/11′-12/12′ positions, and all are detectable in human and mouse RPE (16Ben-Shabat S.

These pigments exhibit absorbances in both the UV and visible regions of the spectrum (A2E: λmax, 439 and 338 nm; iso-A2E: λmax, 428 and 337 nm). Another bisretinoid compound of RPE lipofuscin also absorbs in the short wavelength region of the visible spectrum (17Fishkin N.E. Sparrow J.R. Allikmets R. Nakanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This pigment, all-trans-retinal dimer (atRAL dimer; λmax, 432 and 290 nm) forms from the condensation of two atRAL and is present in RPE lipofuscin as Schiff base conjugates with either PE or ethanolamine (atRAL dimer-PE and atRAL dimer-E, respectively) or as unconjugated atRAL dimer. The pigments atRAL dimer-PE and atRAL dimer-E absorb in the visible range at about 510 nm, a “red” shift relative to atRAL dimer that is attributable to protonation of the Schiff base linkage. Although A2E is a pyridinium salt containing a quaternary amine nitrogen that does not deprotonate or reprotonate (24Sparrow J.R. Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 2988-2995PubMed Google Scholar), the protonation state of the Schiff base linkage in atRAL dimer-PE and atRAL dimer-E is pH-dependent (18Kim S.R. Jang Y.P. Jockusch S. Fishkin N.E.

By mass spectrometry, the photooxidation products of A2E and atRAL dimer present as a series of peaks differing by increments of mass 16 beginning with M+ 592 (A2E) or M+ 552 (atRAL dimer) (18Kim S.R.

The moieties generated by the addition of oxygens at C=C bonds of these bisretinoid compounds include endoperoxides, furanoid oxides, and epoxides (25Jang Y.P. Matsuda H. Itagaki Y. Nakanishi K.

It is also notable that unconjugated atRAL dimer is a more efficient generator of singlet oxygen than is A2E and is also a more efficient quencher of singlet oxygen (18Kim S.R. Jang Y.P. Jockusch S.

Insight into the composition of RPE lipofuscin and the biosynthetic pathways by which these compounds form aids in an understanding of retinal diseases characterized by lipofuscin overload, particularly those associated with mutations in ABCA4 (ATP-binding cassette transporter 4) of photoreceptor cells (1Sparrow J.R.

We report that a previously unrecognized bisretinoid molecule absorbing with maxima at 490 and 331 nm is detected at elevated levels in Abca4−/− mice, a model of recessive Stargardt macular degeneration. This compound is also present in human RPE. By high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS), with corroboration by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), we determined that this molecule is a bisretinoid presenting with a noncharged dihydropyridine core (Fig. 1C). We propose a biosynthetic pathway by which this pigment may form and demonstrate that enzymatic removal of the phosphatidic acid portion of the molecule generates a second novel component of RPE lipofuscin. All-trans-retinal, formic acid and 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine from egg yolk (egg-PE) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. HPLC grade acetonitrile, trifluoroacetic acid, chloroform, and methanol were obtained from Fisher. Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline was obtained from Invitrogen. Albino Abca4/Abcr null mutant mice homozygous for Rpe65-Leu450 were generated and genotyped for the Abcr null mutation and Rpe65-L450M variant by PCR amplification of tail DNA as previously reported (8Kim S.R. Fishkin N. Kong J. Nakanishi K. Allikmets R. Sparrow J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 11668-11672Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For Rpe65 genotyping, digestion of the 545-bp PCR product with MwoI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs) yielded an undigested 545-bp band in the case of Met450, 180- and 365-bp fragments when the sequence corresponded to Leu450, and all three bands in heterozygous mice. Rpe65rd12, Balb/cByJ, and C57BL/6J were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Human donor eyes were received within 12 h of death from the Eye-Bank for Sight Restoration (New York, NY). Fresh bovine eyes were obtained from Sierra for Medical Science (Whittier, CA). Murine posterior eye cups (3–12 eyes/sample as indicated), human RPE/choroid (1 eye/sample), bovine RPE (1 eye/sample), and bovine neural retina (16 retina/sample; retinae washed twice after removal from the eyes) were analyzed. The tissues were homogenized in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline using a tissue grinder in the presence of chloroform/methanol (1:1). Subsequently, the sample was extracted three times with addition of chloroform and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. After passage through a reversed phase (C18 Sep-Pak, Millipore) cartridge with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in methanol, the extract was concentrated by evaporation of solvent under gas and was redissolved in 50% methanolic chloroform (2 eyes/30 ml of solvent). An Alliance system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) equipped with 2695 Separation Module, 2996 Photodiode Array Detector, 2475 Multi λ Fluorescence Detector was used for HPLC analysis. For compound elution, an Atlantis® dC18 (3 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm; Waters) reverse phase column was used for the stationary phase and for the mobile phase a gradient of acetonitrile in water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid: 75–90% acetonitrile (0–30 min); 90–100% acetonitrile (30–40 min); 100% acetonitrile (40–80 min) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Detection by photodiode array was set at 430 and 490 nm. Peak area (μV·s) was determined using Empower® software. Molar quantity per eye was calculated using calibration curves constructed from known concentrations of synthesized standards and a molar extinction coefficient of 26,100 and by normalizing to the ratio of HPLC injection volume versus sample volume. A mixture of egg-PE (7.28 mg, 1 equivalent) in 3 ml of chloroform and atRAL (6 mg, 2 equivalents) in 1 ml of methanol with formic acid (5 ml) was stirred at room temperature in a capped flask in the dark for 7 days. For HPLC analysis, the reaction mixture was concentrated in a rotavapor and injected into an Atlantis® dC18 (3 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm; Waters) reverse phase column. HPLC analysis was performed with monitoring at 490 nm. The mobile phase was a gradient of acetonitrile in water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid: 75–90% (0–30 min) acetonitrile; 90–100% acetonitrile (30–40 min); 100% acetonitrile (40–80 min) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. For elution from a Delta Pak® C4 column (5 μm, 3.9 × 150 mm; Waters), the following gradient of acetonitrile in water with 0.1% formic acid was utilized: 0–5 min; 75% acetonitrile, flow rate, 0.8 ml/min; 5–20 min, 75–100% acetonitrile; flow rate, 0.8–1.2 ml/min; 20–30 min, 100% acetonitrile, flow rate, 1.2 ml/min. A2PE (100 μg) and A2-DHP-PE (100 μg) were dissolved in Me2SO (30 μl) and then added to 970 μl of 40 mm MOPS buffer (pH 6.5) containing 300 units/ml phospholipase D (PLD) (from Streptomyces chromofuscus; Biomol International, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and 15 mm CaCl2. The mixtures were incubated for 2, 3, and 6 h at 37 °C and then extracted with 2:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dried under argon, and redissolved in 60 μl of 50% methanolic chloroform. A2PE and A2E were detected by HPLC using the C4 column, with an injection volume of 30 μl, 430 nm monitoring, the gradients of acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid described above, and a total running time of 50 min. To detect the cleavage product of PLD-mediated hydrolysis of A2-DHP-PE, the dC18 column was used with monitoring at 490 nm. The gradient of acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid was the same as described above, and the total running time was 100 min. HPLC-MSwas performed using a Bruker EsquireTM 3000 ion trap mass spectrometer that was coupled on-line to an Agilent 1100 series HPLC. The mass spectrometer was equipped with ESI interface and ion trap analyzer operating in full scan mode from m/z 50–2000. The same dC18 column and mobile phase was used as discussed above for HPLC. Mass spectral detection was achieved using atmospheric pressure electrospray ionization in positive and negative mode. Helium was employed as the nebulizer gas with heating gas flow rate at 8 liters/min and pressure at 25 p.s.i. The ion source temperature was 350 °C. The capillary exit was set at 166.9 V with the skim voltage at 71.1 V. MS detection was carried out in alternating positive and negative ion modes or in MS2 mode. EsquireControl software permitted data acquisition and instrument control. FTIR spectra were obtained using a Matson RS-1 series spectrometer with a deuterated triglycine sulfate detector. The spectrometer and the sample compartment were continuously purged with Praxair purge gas generator to remove CO2 and moisture. The sample in methanol was deposited on a CaF2 window, and methanol was rapidly evaporated, which created a dry film of the sample. This CaF2 window was mounted on the sample compartment, and an identical clean CaF2 window was placed on the reference compartment of a “shuttle” cell. The shuttle cell takes blocks of data alternately between the sample and reference compartments and then cycles, eliminating artifactual signal caused by temporal variations in CO2 and moisture. All of the spectra were obtained at room temperature (∼22 °C). The first set of spectra was obtained in about 1 h. Thereafter, three more sets were obtained. Because all the sets gave identical results, we concluded that the sample was stable throughout the experiment and added and averaged the spectra. The IR spectra of two model compounds having dihydropyridine (I) and dihydropyridinium (II) cores corresponding to A2-DHP-PE and dihydropyridinium-A2PE, respectively, were computed by density functional theory using the Gaussian 03 program (4Katz M.L. Drea C.M. Robison Jr., W.G. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1986; 35: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A B3LYP functional was employed along with the basis set 6-31G+(d,p) to optimize the structures and calculate IR vibrational frequencies. At this level of density functional theory, and for the basis set used, a scaling factor of 0.9806 is suggested to compare the calculated spectra to those experimentally observed. Because our primary interest in this calculation is to differentiate between the pyridine and pyridinium cores, only the calculated C–N modes are discussed, and the scaled frequencies are quoted in the text. The Abca4 null mutant mouse serves as a model of autosomal recessive Stargardt disease and has been shown to accumulate the bisretinoid compounds of RPE lipofuscin in abundance (8Kim S.R. Fishkin N.

Accordingly, we analyzed chloroform/methanol extracts of posterior eyecups of Abca4−/− mice (age, 5 months) by reverse phase HPLC while monitoring at 490 nm. As expected, peaks in the HPLC profile could be readily assigned to previously identified lipofuscin pigments including A2E, isoA2E, and atRAL dimer-PE (8Kim S.R. Fishkin N. Kong J. Nakanishi K.

With an analytical running time of 80 min, we also readily detected a previously unidentified peak that exhibited absorbance maxima of 490 and 331 nm and a retention time (Rt) of 46.2 min; this peak eluted immediately in front of atRAL dimer-PE (Fig. 2A). Online fluorescence monitoring showed that when considered relative to the corresponding absorbance and with emission monitored at 630 nm and excitation at 430 nm, the fluorescence exhibited by the 490/331 nm peak of interest was of greater intensity than A2E, isoA2E, and atRAL dimer-PE (Fig. 2B). To test the origin of this compound as a vitamin A aldehyde adduct, we compared the chromatographic profile generated using eyecup extracts from Abca4−/− mice (Fig. 2A) to that from Rpe65rd12 mice (age 2 months) (Fig. 2C) that do not generate 11-cis-retinal and atRAL chromophores (30Pang J.J. Chang B. Hawes N.L. Hurd R.E. Davisson M.T. Li J. Noorwez S.M. Malhotra R. McDowell J.H. Kaushal S. Hauswirth W.W. Nusinowitz S. Thompson D.A. Heckenlively J.R. Mol. Vis. 2005; 11: 152-162PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, when the eluents were monitored for absorbance at 490 nm, the samples from the Rpe65rd12 mice were distinguished by an absence of bisretinoid constituents such as A2E, isoA2E, and atRAL dimer-PE that are present in the Abca4−/− mouse (Fig. 2A). Also absent in the case of the Rpe65rd12 mice was the 490/331 nm peak at Rt of ∼46 min. Our next aim was to establish whether the compound with 490/331-nm absorbance in the mouse eyecups was generated in reaction mixtures of atRAL and PE (Fig. 2D). Egg-PE was used as the starting material because, having fatty acids of varying carbon lengths and degrees of saturation, it is more complex than, for instance, dipalmitoyl-l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine. After incubating the reactants in a 1:2 ratio (egg-PE:all-trans-retinal) for 7 days, we analyzed the mixture by reverse phase HPLC using a dC18 column and gradient of acetonitrile and water (with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Accordingly, the elution profile revealed a peak with UV-visible absorbance maxima at 490 and 333 nm; this peak also eluted with the same Rt (46.0 min) as the 490/331-nm absorbance peak in the mouse eyecup extract (Fig. 2A). Again, this peak eluted just before atRAL dimer-PE (Rt, 47.5 min); unconjugated atRAL dimer exhibited a Rt of 75.5 min. When analyzing the same reaction mixtures using a dC4 column (Fig. 2D, inset), atRAL, and NRPE, precursors of the A2PE/A2E biosynthetic pathway were readily detectable on the basis of UV-visible absorbance as was the product A2PE; the latter compound does not elute from a dC18 column. Molecular mass and structural characterization of the 490/333 nm intermediate was carried out utilizing HPLC-ESI-MS/MS, a soft ionization method. With chromatographic separation on a dC18 column and ESI operating in negative ion mode, the 490/336-nm peak eluting with a Rt of 46.0 min presented in the MS scan as a prominent chloride adduct ion [M + Cl]− at m/z 1259.8, corresponding to the chlorinated molecular ion of a phosphatidyl-dihydropyridine bisretinoid compound (C77H126ClNO8 P, calculated as 1258.891) (Fig. 3); we will refer to this compound as A2-dihydropyridine-phosphatidylethanolamine (A2-DHP-PE). The observed m/z 1259.8 was consistent with a phosphatidic acid moiety having dipalmitic acid as fatty acid constituent. With respect to the identification of the m/z 1259.8 peak as a dihydropyridine compound, it is important to note that were it a dihydropyridinium compound bearing a positive charge conferred by a quaternary ami"
https://openalex.org/W2021615423,"The mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex (ubiquinol/cytochrome c oxidoreductase) is generally thought to generate superoxide anion that participates in cell signaling and contributes to cellular damage in aging and degenerative disease. However, the isolated, detergent-solubilized bc1 complex does not generate measurable amounts of superoxide except when inhibited by antimycin. In addition, indirect measurements of superoxide production by cells and isolated mitochondria have not clearly resolved the contribution of the bc1 complex to the generation of superoxide by mitochondria in vivo, nor did they establish the effect, if any, of membrane potential on superoxide formation by this enzyme complex. In this study we show that the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex does generate significant amounts of superoxide when reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. The rate of superoxide generation by the reconstituted bc1 complex increased exponentially with increased magnitude of the membrane potential, a finding that is compatible with the suggestion that membrane potential inhibits electron transfer from the cytochrome bL to bH hemes, thereby promoting the formation of a ubisemiquinone radical that interacts with oxygen to generate superoxide. When the membrane potential was further increased, by the addition of nigericin or by the imposition of a diffusion potential, the rate of generation of superoxide was further accelerated and approached the rate obtained with antimycin. These findings suggest that the bc1 complex may contribute significantly to superoxide generation by mitochondria in vivo, and that the rate of superoxide generation can be controlled by modulation of the mitochondrial membrane potential.

The rate of superoxide generation by the reconstituted bc1 complex increased exponentially with increased magnitude of the membrane potential, a finding that is compatible with the suggestion that membrane potential inhibits electron transfer from the cytochrome bL to bH hemes, thereby promoting the formation of a ubisemiquinone radical that interacts with oxygen to generate superoxide. When the membrane potential was further increased, by the addition of nigericin or by the imposition of a diffusion potential, the rate of generation of superoxide was further accelerated and approached the rate obtained with antimycin. These findings suggest that the bc1 complex may contribute significantly to superoxide generation by mitochondria in vivo, and that the rate of superoxide generation can be controlled by modulation of the mitochondrial membrane potential. The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system utilizes the energy derived from the oxidation of metabolic substrates to drive the synthesis of ATP. Electron transport through the NADH dehydrogenase complex, cytochrome bc1 complex, and cytochrome c oxidase complex is coupled to proton translocation across the mitochondrial inner membrane, thus generating a protonmotive force (Δp) consisting of a membrane potential (ΔΨ) and a pH gradient (ΔpH) that drives the synthesis of ATP by the ATP synthase (reviewed in Ref. 1.Saraste M. Science. 1999; 283: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Several of the mitochondrial electron transport complexes produce free radical intermediates that interact with oxygen to generate superoxide (reviewed in Refs. 2.Adam-Vizi V. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 3.Murphy M.P. Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Superoxide is a highly reactive compound that can lead to the formation of other free radicals and reactive compounds and thus damage directly or indirectly cellular proteins, DNA, and phospholipids. It is also believed that free radical damage is a major cause of aging and contributes to many degenerative diseases (reviewed in Ref. 4.Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar). Studies with isolated mitochondria have attempted to evaluate the contributions of the different mitochondrial energy-transducing complexes to this process (5.Zoccarato F. Cavallini L. Deana R.

J. 2008; 409: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). An early study with isolated rat heart mitochondria suggested that the bc1 complex produces large amounts of superoxide, but only when the mitochondrial membrane potential is high (10.Korshunov S.S. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). This conclusion led to the suggestion that cells modulate the magnitude of the mitochondrial protonmotive force to protect the mitochondria from excess production of superoxide (11.Brand M.D. Buckingham J.A. Esteves T.C. Green K. Lambert A.J. Miwa S. Murphy M.P. Pakay J.L. Talbot D.A. Echtay K.S. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2004; 71: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, it was shown later that with high concentrations of succinate as a substrate and without rotenone (as in Ref. 10.Korshunov S.S. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar), most of the superoxide is generated by reverse electron transport through complex I (8.Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Moreover, the rate of generation of superoxide by reverse electron transport through complex I was shown to be more strongly dependent on ΔpH than on Δψ (12.Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). It was also suggested that the contribution of the bc1 complex to superoxide generation by mitochondria is negligible compared with that produced by reverse electron transport through complex I (9.Muller F.L. Liu Y. Abdul-Ghani M.A. Lustgarten M.S. Bhattacharya A. Jang Y.C. Van Remmen H. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), but it is not clear whether reverse electron transport is a significant process under most physiological conditions. Several groups have measured superoxide production by the detergent-solubilized bc1 complex isolated from either yeast or beef heart. It was possible to observe superoxide production by the isolated, detergent-solubilized bc1 complex that was mutated in key residues at the ubiquinol oxidation site (13.Wenz T. Covian R. Hellwig P. Macmillan F. Meunier B. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3977-3988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the native enzyme did not produce measurable amounts of superoxide except when inhibited by antimycin or other bc1 complex inhibitors (14.Muller F. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 15.Muller F.L. Roberts A.G. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M.

Chem. 2008; 283: 21649-21654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the antimycin-induced generation of superoxide by the bc1 complex is fairly well understood within the framework of the Q cycle mechanism, shown in Fig. 1. Following the oxidation of ubiquinol at center P, as electrons recycle through the b hemes, antimycin inhibits reduction of ubiquinone at center N and electrons back up in center P, resulting in the formation of a ubisemiquinone radical, which can interact with oxygen to form superoxide (15.Muller F.L. Roberts A.G. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6493-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18.Dröse S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21649-21654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). It also can be predicted that the membrane potential would inhibit electron transfer from heme bL to bH and stimulate the production of superoxide by the bc1 complex. However, it is not known whether this prediction actually manifests and, if so, how strong is the dependence of superoxide production by the bc1 complex on the magnitude of membrane potential. We have attempted to resolve this issue by reconstitution of the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex into phospholipid vesicles, followed by measuring the rate of superoxide generation in parallel with the magnitude of the membrane potential that is generated by the reconstituted enzyme. Our findings indicate that superoxide anion formation by the bc1 complex in situ depends strongly on membrane potential and can approach values similar to those promoted by antimycin. All reagents were purchased from Sigma except Amplex® UltraRed that was purchased from Molecular Probes. Cytochrome bc1 complex was isolated from Red Star cake yeast as described previously (19.Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D.E. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), except that the dodecyl maltoside concentration was increased to 0.05% in the elution buffers, and the volume of DEAE-Bio-Gel A was reduced to 25 ml to increase the yield of active enzyme. Quantification of the bc1 complex was performed as described (20.Snyder C. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using extinction coefficients of 17.5 mm−1 cm−1 at 553–539 nm for cytochrome c1 (21.Yu C.A. Yu L. King T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1012-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 25.6 mm−1 cm−1 at 563–579 nm for the average absorbance of the bH and bL hemes in cytochrome b (22.Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Unilamellar phospholipid vesicles were prepared by sonication of an ice-cold mixture of 40 mg of sodium cholate and 60 mg of asolectin in 4 ml of dialysis buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm K+-HEPES, pH 7.3), using a model 500 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher) set at 20% power amplitude for 10 s, repeated every 20 s until the suspension became clear. The suspension of phospholipid vesicles was mixed with 1 nmol of the purified bc1 complex to a concentration of 0.25 μm. The mixture was then loaded into two dialysis cassettes (20,000 molecular weight cutoff, Thermo Scientific) that were immersed in 0.5 liter of the cold dialysis buffer and dialyzed at 4 °C for 24 h, with 3–4 changes of the buffer. During dialysis the volume of the suspension increased to 6 ml, resulting in a final concentration of 0.167 μm bc1 complex. However, only 0.05 μm of this enzyme was active, as determined by the extent of cytochrome c reduction obtained by rapid mixing of vesicles with DBH 3The abbreviations used are: DBHdecyl ubiquinoneHRPhorseradish peroxidaseRh123rhodamine 123QubiquinoneFCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. in the presence of antimycin using an Olis rapid scanning monochromator stopped flow spectrophotometer. Addition of detergent did not increase the amount of bc1 complex that was able to react with cytochrome c, indicating that all the reconstituted enzyme was oriented with cytochrome c1 protruding outside of the vesicles. decyl ubiquinone horseradish peroxidase rhodamine 123 ubiquinone carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. DBH was prepared from decyl ubiquinone as described (23.Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and quantified by UV spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient of 4.14 mm−1 cm−1 at 290 nm (24.Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The rate of cytochrome c reduction was measured in an Aminco DW2a double-beam spectrophotometer at 550–539 nm. The 2-ml reaction mixture consisted of the dialysis buffer supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KCN, 15 μm cytochrome c, 30 μm DBH, and 40 μl of the reconstituted vesicles, such that the bc1 concentration in the reaction mixture was 3.34 nm. Rates of superoxide generation were measured by the Amplex® UltraRed-HRP assay (25.Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). In this method superoxide is rapidly converted to hydrogen peroxide by a large excess of superoxide dismutase, whereas HRP couples the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide to the formation of the Amplex® UltraRed fluorescent oxidation product resorufin. The rate of formation of the fluorescent product was monitored with an Hitachi F3010 fluorescence spectrophotometer, using excitation and emission wavelengths of 526 and 590 nm, respectively. The measurement of the rate of superoxide generation by the reconstituted bc1 complex presents a daunting challenge because DBH reduces cytochrome c directly, apparently generating a semiquinone radical that interacts with oxygen to produce superoxide, independent of the reaction catalyzed by the bc1 complex. The direct chemical reaction is enhanced in phospholipid vesicles and under some conditions could produce superoxide at a rate that far exceeds the rate of superoxide production by the bc1 complex (26.Zhang L. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33972-33976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Moreover, the large scale changes in the absorption of cytochrome c during its reduction interfere with the fluorescence measurements, because both the excitation and emission spectra overlap the absorption spectra of reduced cytochrome c. Therefore, we devised an assay that overcomes these difficulties as described in the supplemental material. We estimated the membrane potential that was generated by the reconstituted bc1 complex from the extent of fluorescence quenching of the positively charged fluorescence probe rhodamine 123 (27.Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The formation of a membrane potential, negative inside, by the bc1 complex proton translocation induces uptake of the probe into the phospholipid vesicles that contain the coupled bc1 complex, and the fluorescence of the probe inside the vesicle, which becomes highly concentrated, is quenched as shown in Fig. 2. The magnitude of the fluorescence quenching is a function of the magnitude of the membrane potential. The generation of membrane potential by the bc1-catalyzed reduction of cytochrome c by DBH is associated with large changes in the absorption of cytochrome c that may interfere with measurement of the Rh123 fluorescence. Therefore, we selected an excitation wavelength that coincides with an isosbestic point in the cytochrome c reduced versus oxidized spectra (504 nm), and an emission wavelength that coincides with another isosbestic point (526 nm). After the addition of DBH, there is initial direct quenching of the probe and a slower quenching that results from the accumulation of the probe in the vesicles (Fig. 2). To estimate the protonmotive force, we added 2 μg/ml nigericin. Nigericin catalyzes a K+/H+ exchange that collapses the pH gradient and thus allows the membrane potential to increase to the full magnitude of the protonmotive force. Nigericin only stimulated slightly the rate of cytochrome c reduction (see below), indicating that the magnitude of the protonmotive force is not significantly reduced by nigericin. Finally, we added 1 μg/ml valinomycin that completely collapsed the membrane potential because of the high concentration of potassium in the assay medium (100 mm KCl). The collapse of the membrane potential induced a rapid release of the probe that was accumulated in the energized vesicles, and therefore the fluorescence that was measured immediately after the valinomycin-induced release was taken as the fluorescence in the absence of membrane potential. This protocol corrects for the direct quenching of Rh123 by DBH (see Fig. 2). The potential dependent quenching (Q) is calculated from the value of the fluorescence (F) before the addition of valinomycin (F−val) and the value after the addition of valinomycin (F+val) as shown in Equation 1,Q=1−F−val/F+val100(Eq. 1) Q calculated from the fluorescence before the addition of nigericin is a function of the membrane potential that is generated by the coupled bc1 complex, whereas Q calculated from the fluorescence after the addition of nigericin is a function of the protonmotive force that is generated by the coupled bc1 complex, and the difference between Q after the addition of nigericin and Q before the addition of nigericin is a function of ΔpH. Although Q depends on the membrane potential, it is not a linear function of the membrane potential. Assuming that the positively charged probe reaches electrochemical equilibrium and that all the fluorescence of the probe that has been taken into the vesicles is quenched, the membrane potential can be estimated from the value of Q, provided that the internal volume of the coupled vesicles (Vi in μl/ml) is known (Equation 2).ΔΨ=59×logQ100−Q×1000/Vi(Eq. 2) Fig. 3 shows the predicted relationships between Q and ΔΨ that would be obtained at different internal volumes as calculated from Equation 2. It is observed that in general Q increases exponentially with an increase in ΔΨ. Moreover, when the internal volume is very small, only high ΔΨ values would result in a measurable Q, and when the internal volume is large, even relatively low ΔΨ values would result in measurable Q. In our assay conditions (see Fig. 2), the predicted volume of the phospholipid vesicles is ∼0.5 μl/ml, i.e. ∼1 μl/mg phospholipid (28.Katz Y. Diamond J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1974; 17: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, only a fraction of the vesicles can be expected to have active-coupled bc1 complex. Indeed, when we incorporated the pH indicator pyranine into the phospholipid vesicles before reconstitution and monitored the change in pH that was induced by DBH, only a small fraction (15–20%) of the vesicle-trapped pyranine appeared to respond (results not shown). This suggests that the range of effective internal volume values is quite narrow, between 0.075 and 0.1 μl/ml, when the correction factor for the percent of vesicles that contains the coupled enzyme is applied. This allows us to provide reasonable estimates of the relative magnitude of membrane potential from the measurement of Q. We reconstituted the isolated, detergent-solubilized bc1 complex into phospholipid vesicles composed of a mixture of soybean phospholipids and cholate. After 24 h of dialysis to remove most of the detergent, the rate of DBH reduction of cytochrome c catalyzed by the reconstituted complex, shown by the open bars in Fig. 4, was stimulated ∼5-fold (respiratory control) by the addition of the protonophore, FCCP, indicating that the reconstituted complex generates a large protonmotive force across the phospholipid membrane (Fig. 4). Addition of the ionophore valinomycin, which in the presence of 100 mm KCl can be expected to collapse completely ΔΨ but not ΔpH, stimulated cytochrome c reduction almost as much as FCCP, suggesting that ΔΨ is a major component of Δp in the bc1 vesicles. In contrast, nigericin, which collapses ΔpH, stimulated cytochrome c reduction only slightly, suggesting that nigericin induces an increase in ΔΨ almost equal to the collapsed ΔpH, thus retaining the magnitude of Δp in the bc1 vesicles (see also Fig. 2). Antimycin inhibited cytochrome c reduction but not completely, whereas the inhibition by stigmatellin was more complete. The residual cytochrome c reduction after stigmatellin addition can be attributed to the direct chemical reduction by DBH. Reconstitution stabilized the bc1 complex so that it retained its activity for more than a week, provided it was kept in the cold (4 °C). Interestingly, after 24 h of storage the respiratory control first increased and then gradually decreased after prolonged storage, as shown in Fig. 5. To determine the magnitude of ΔΨ and ΔpH and the magnitude of the protonmotive force (i.e. ΔΨ + ΔpH), we measured the DBH-induced quenching of the Rh123 fluorescence (Fig. 2). Fig. 5 shows an example, from a typical preparation, of the changes in cytochrome c reduction rates, ΔΨ, ΔpH, and Δp over the course of several days. Freshly prepared phospholipid-reconstituted bc1 complex has relatively high membrane potential and low ΔpH, but over a period of several days of storage, membrane potential is decreased but ΔpH is increased. This suggests that the ion permeability of the liposomes increased slowly during storage. The permeability of ions constrains the value of membrane potential that can be generated by the bc1 complex. However, as long as the proton permeability does not increase to the point that the proton leak rate is the same as the proton translocation rate, ΔpH will increase. Over time the proton permeability also increases, hence the gradual and slower decrease of the protonmotive force. Because Δp decreased after 24 h of storage, while respiratory control increased, we attribute the latter effect to the instability of a fraction of the bc1 complex that was absorbed on the surface of the liposomes but not fully inserted into the phospholipid bilayer. Apparently, proper reconstitution into the lipid bilayer stabilized the bc1 complex. We followed respiratory control, ΔΨ, ΔpH, and Δp in five preparations of reconstituted bc1 complex over 4 days, and the results generally followed the pattern shown in Fig. 5. When we looked at the correlation between respiratory control (RC) and each of these parameters (i.e. ΔΨ, ΔpH, or Δp), there was a significant correlation between log(RC) and the calculated Δp, a much weaker and not significant correlation with ΔΨ, and no correlation with ΔpH. This is what is expected from well coupled proton translocation; the rate of translocation should be controlled by the protonmotive force but not by its components; the weak correlation with membrane potential resulted from the fact that ΔΨ is the major component of Δp, and with time they decline in parallel. The coupled, reconstituted bc1 complex generated significant amounts of superoxide (supplemental Fig. S1). To find out how superoxide generation depends on the magnitude of ΔΨ, ΔpH, or Δp, we measured the effect of FCCP, nigericin, and valinomycin on the rate of superoxide generation in freshly prepared bc1 vesicles. As shown by the solid bars in Fig. 4, FCCP and valinomycin strongly inhibited the rate of superoxide generation, and nigericin stimulated superoxide generation. Because valinomycin collapses ΔΨ but not ΔpH, and nigericin collapses ΔpH while increasing ΔΨ (but not Δp), it is apparent that the rate of superoxide generation depends strongly only on the magnitude of ΔΨ, with no evidence that either ΔpH or Δp has any effect on superoxide generation. Fig. 4 also shows the effect of antimycin on the rate of superoxide generation. The value obtained from the antimycin-inhibited bc1 complex, which is arguably the maximal rate of superoxide generation that can be expected in the native bc1 complex, is not much higher than that observed in the coupled bc1 complex, particularly in the presence of nigericin. To further evaluate the effects of ΔΨ, ΔpH, and Δp on superoxide generation, we followed the changes in these parameters (as in Fig. 5) in parallel with the rates of superoxide generation over several days in five different preparations of reconstituted bc1 complex. As can be predicted from Fig. 4, only the Q value before the addition of nigericin, which is a function of the magnitude of ΔΨ that is generated by the coupled bc1 complex, exhibits a statistically significant correlation with the rate of superoxide generation (Fig. 6, inset). The rate of superoxide generation did not correlate with ΔpH and only very weakly with Δp, because the latter was correlated with ΔΨ (results not shown). The inset in Fig. 6 demonstrates clearly that the rate of superoxide generation by the coupled bc1 complex is a function of ΔΨ, whereas Fig. 6 shows the dependence of the rate of superoxide generation on ΔΨ, as calculated from Q, based on Equation 2 (as in Fig. 3). We estimated the effective volume of reconstituted vesicles as 0.1 μl, after correcting for the percent of vesicles that contain coupled enzyme, but different values of internal volume would only shift the curve to the left or right and would not change the shape of the curve. We also included in this plot the values measured at high FCCP concentration (ΔΨ = 0). It is evident that below a certain threshold (120–150 mV) very little superoxide is generated by the bc1 complex, and that superoxide generation increases exponentially with ΔΨ. Notably, this voltage threshold is comparable with the increment in potentials of the bL and bH hemes. To be able to generate a K+ diffusion potential, we prepared the phospholipid vesicles as usual in a K+-rich medium (100 mm), but after 20 h of dialysis of the bc1-reconstituted vesicles in K+ buffer, we dialyzed the reconstituted bc1 complex against Na+ buffer to replace all of the K+ outside the vesicles with Na+. The Na+-suspended vesicles retained their activity and respiratory control but increased their rate of superoxide production nearly 2-fold (Table 1). This was apparently due to the formation of a diffusion potential, negative inside, by the K+ concentration gradient. Indeed, the addition of Rh123 to the Na+-suspended vesicles resulted in a strong quenching of the fluorescence following the initial high fluorescence (Fig. 7). Addition of KCl to the medium restored the fluorescence to its initial value, indicating that the quenching resulted from a K+ diffusion potential. Nigericin catalyzed the efflux of K+ from the vesicles and thus collapsed the diffusion potential, and that resulted in enhanced fluorescence.TABLE 1Effect of potassium diffusion potential and nigericin on the rate of superoxide generationConditionsRate of superoxide generations−1 ± S.E.K+ medium0.085 ± 0.008Na+ medium (103 mm)0.137 ± 0.017K+ medium + nigericin0.138 ± 0.014Na+ medium + nigericin0.107 ± 0.007 Open table in a new tab DBH oxidation by Na+-suspended vesicles also generated membrane potential and thus further increased fluorescence quenching (Fig. 8). In K+-suspended vesicles nigericin increased the quenching (Fig. 8, left panel, and Fig. 2), but in Na+ buffer nigericin enhances the fluorescence because it collapsed the diffusion potential (as in Fig. 7). Valinomycin, which catalyzed the electrogenic influx of K+, collapsed the bc1-generated membrane potential (Fig. 8). In the Na+ buffer superoxide generation was nearly twice as fast as when the vesicles were suspended in K+ buffer (Table 1), reflecting the contribution of the K+ diffusion potential. In Na+ buffer nigericin inhibited superoxide production, in contrast to its effect in K+ buffer where nigericin stimulated superoxide production (Table 1 and Fig. 4). These contrasting effects resulted from the different effects of nigericin on ΔΨ in K+ and Na+ medium. In K+ medium nigericin increased ΔΨ (see FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8), and in Na+ medium nigericin decreased the K+ diffusion potential (Fig. 8). In a Na+ medium where there is a large K+ concentration gradient (K+in ≫ K+out), nigericin catalyzes the electroneutral efflux of K+ that collapses the K+ gradient and hence the diffusion potential. In high K+ medium, where there is no K+ gradient, nigericin catalyzes electroneutral uptake of K+, driven by the pH gradient. The collapse of the pH gradient allows ΔΨ to increase. The effect of the K+ diffusion potential on the rate of superoxide generation and the contrasting effects of nigericin in Na+ and K+ medium lend further support to the conclusion that the magnitude of ΔΨ greatly affects the rate of superoxide generation by the bc1 complex. In previous studies of the reconstituted bc1 complex, the coupling was evaluated by the determination of the proton/electron stoichiometry (29.Leung K.H. Hinkle P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8467-8471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Yang X.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11962-11970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To the extent that the measured stoichiometry deviates from the mechanistic stoichiometry, such determination can reveal what fraction of the electron transport activity arises from the bc1 complex that is not coupled. However, it is not a sensitive measure of the degree of coupling of the reconstituted bc1 complex (31.Rottenberg H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 549: 225-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this study we attempted to determine, for the first time, the magnitude of the protonmotive force that is generated by the bc1 complex reconstituted into liposomes. Although there is some uncertainty in the values calculated from the fluorescence quenching of Rh123, the fact that such massive quenching is obtained with a very small volume of coupled vesicles suggests that Δp in the coupled vesicles is quite high. Considering that it is very likely that not all the detergent is removed by the dialysis, which would increase the membrane permeability, it is likely that the magnitude of Δp in these vesicles is constrained by the phospholipid membrane permeability of protons and not by the intrinsic degree of coupling of the bc1 complex. It would be of interest to find whether there are differences between bc1 complexes from different organisms in the degree of coupling and whether there are mutants that exhibit a lower degree of coupling than that observed with the native bc1 complex from yeast. Most previous studies of superoxide generation by the isolated, detergent-solubilized bc1 complex did not yield measurable rates of superoxide generation except in the presence of cytochrome b inhibitors (13.Wenz T.

Chem. 2008; 283: 21649-21654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). As we show here, the rates of superoxide generation in the coupled bc1 complex in the absence of any inhibitors are an order of magnitude higher than that of the uncoupled complex and at high membrane potential approach the rates that were obtained with antimycin. Moreover, the protocol that we developed here, and that can be applied also to the detergent-solubilized complex, allows measurements of superoxide generation even when the rates are below that of the chemical reaction. A central finding of this study, with important implications regarding the mechanism of superoxide generation by the bc1 complex, is that membrane potential alone and not the protonmotive force determines the rate of superoxide production. Not only was the correlation between membrane potential and superoxide generation rate much stronger than that with the protonmotive force, but nigericin, which increases membrane potential but not protonmotive force, also increased rather than decreased the rate of superoxide production. Respiratory control correlated with the protonmotive force more strongly than with the membrane potential. This is expected because it is the coupling of electron transfer to proton transport that inhibits electron transfer when the protonmotive force is high. Although one cannot assign this inhibition to any specific step in the Q cycle, it must involve steps associated with proton translocation. But the inhibition of superoxide generation can be assigned, on the basis of these results, to the only transmembrane electrogenic step in the Q cycle, electron transfer from heme bL to heme bH. This result confirms the suggestion that superoxide is generated at center P because of the formation of a semiquinone anion that shares an electron with heme bL (Fig. 1). Several recent studies of superoxide generation suggested that the bc1 complex does not contribute significantly to superoxide generation by mitochondria. This conclusion was based on the results of experiments with various metabolic substrates and electron transport inhibitors (9.Muller F.L. Liu Y. Abdul-Ghani M.A. Lustgarten M.S. Bhattacharya A. Jang Y.C. Van Remmen H. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32.Kudin A.P. Malinska D. Kunz W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The most persuasive observation that led to this conclusion is that under conditions that favor reverse electron transport through complex I there is a very rapid generation of superoxide. Under conditions that allow electron transport through the bc1 complex, but not reverse electron transport through complex I, there was relatively slow generation of superoxide. However, it is not clear that the conditions that result in a high rate of superoxide generation by complex I (i.e. reverse electron transport) actually exist in the cell under most circumstances. In the reconstituted bc1 complex we obtained a superoxide formation (“leak”) rate of 3.68%. Applying this value to the state 4 electron transfer rate of mitochondria, e.g. ∼40 nmol/mg protein·min, yields a rate of ∼1472 pmol/mg protein·min. This predicted value is comparable with the high rates of superoxide production by intact mitochondria that were attributed to reverse electron transport through complex I or to the bc1 complex in the presence of antimycin (9.Muller F.L. Liu Y. Abdul-Ghani M.A. Lustgarten M.S. Bhattacharya A. Jang Y.C. Van Remmen H. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and were also reported recently to be generated by the bc1 complex in rat mitochondria from several tissues (33.Tahara E.B. Navarete F.D. Kowaltowski A.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 46: 1283-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). An important feature of superoxide generation by the bc1 complex is that it is generated in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, in contrast to most other sources of mitochondrial superoxide that are located in the matrix. It is therefore unlikely that bc1-generated superoxide is a major contributor to free radical damage to mtDNA and matrix proteins. However, the bc1 complex is likely to be a major contributor to free radical damage in other cell compartments and is also likely to signal superoxide generation to these compartments. Indeed, several recent studies suggest that the free radicals that are generated by the mitochondria serve as a signal to initiate different pathways in the cell, and most of these studies implicate the bc1 complex as the source of the signal (34.Bell E.L.

Moreover, it appears that the magnitude of the superoxide signal that originates in the intermembrane space can be enhanced by modulating the intermembrane space concentration of superoxide dismutase (40.Kawamata H. Manfredi G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 3303-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) or cytochrome c (41.Zhao Y. Wang Z.B. Xu J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2356-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the results of this study provide the first direct evidence that the coupled bc1 complex generates superoxide at a rate that depends strongly on the magnitude of the membrane potential. These results also suggest that at high membrane potential the bc1 complex is a major contributor to the generation of superoxide by mitochondria.

The discovery that reduced activity of the mitochondrial enzyme CLK-1/MCLK1 (also known as COQ7) extends lifespan in both Caenorhabditis elegans and mice has provided a genetic model to test mitochondrial theories of aging. We have recently shown that the mitochondria of young, long-lived, Mclk1+/− mice are dysfunctional, exhibiting reduced energy metabolism and a substantial increase in oxidative stress. Here we demonstrate that this altered mitochondrial condition in young animals paradoxically results in an almost complete protection from the age-de pend ent loss of mitochondrial function as well as in a significant attenuation of the rate of development of oxidative biomarkers of aging. Moreover, we show that reduction in MCLK1 levels can also gradually prevent the deterioration of mitochondrial function and associated increase of global oxidative stress that is normally observed in Sod2+/− mutants. We hypothesize that the mitochondrial dysfunction observed in young Mclk1+/− mutants induces a physiological state that ultimately allows for their slow rate of aging. Thus, our study provides for a unique vertebrate model in which an initial alteration in a specific mitochondrial function is linked to long term beneficial effects on biomarkers of aging and, furthermore, provides for new evidence which indicates that mitochondrial oxidative stress is not causal to aging.

Thus, our study provides for a unique vertebrate model in which an initial alteration in a specific mitochondrial function is linked to long term beneficial effects on biomarkers of aging and, furthermore, provides for new evidence which indicates that mitochondrial oxidative stress is not causal to aging. Because it is well known that the aging process is characterized by declines in basal metabolic rate and in the general performance of energy-dependent processes, many aging studies have focused on mitochondria because of their central role in producing chemical energy (ATP) by oxidative phosphorylation (1Navarro A. Boveris A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C670-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Among the various theories of aging that have been proposed, the mitochondrial oxidative stress theory of aging is the most widely acknowledged and studied (2Harman D. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 1972; 20: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar, 3Balaban R.S. Nemoto S. Finkel T.

It is based on the observation that mitochondrial energy metabolism produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), 2The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesUQcoenzyme Q8-OHdG8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMDAmalondialdehyde. that mitochondrial components are damaged by ROS, that mitochondrial function is progressively lost during aging, and that the progressive accumulation of global oxidative damage is strongly correlated with the aged phenotype. However, the crucial question of whether these facts mean that mitochondrial dysfunction and the related ROS production cause aging remains unproven (5Austad S. Aging Cell. 2008; 7: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 6Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Aging Cell. 2007; 6: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Sohal R.S. Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent observations made in various species, including mammals, have begun to directly challenge this hypothesis, notably by relating oxidative stress to long (8Andziak B. O'Connor T.P.

A direct and powerful approach to attempt to clarify this major question and to test the theory is to characterize the mitochondrial function of long-lived mutants (12Hekimi S. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CLK-1/MCLK1 is an evolutionary conserved protein (13Ewbank J.J. Barnes T.M. Lakowski B. Lussier M. Bussey H. Hekimi S. Science. 1997; 275: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and has been found to be located in the mitochondria of yeast (14Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and mice (16Jiang N. Levavasseur F. McCright B. Shoubridge E.A. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29218-29225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The inactivation of the Caenorhabditis elegans gene clk-1 substantially increases lifespan (17Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Science. 1996; 272: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Moreover, the elimination of one functional allele of its murine orthologue also resulted in an extended longevity for Mclk1+/− mice in three distinct genetic backgrounds (18Liu X. Jiang N. Hughes B. Bigras E. Shoubridge E. Hekimi S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). These findings have provided for an evolutionarily conserved pathways of animal aging that is affected by the function of a mitochondrial protein (19Hekimi S. Guarente L. Science. 2003; 299: 1351-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 20Stepanyan Z. Hughes B. Cliche D.O. Camp D. Hekimi S. Exp. Gerontol. 2006; 41: 940-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In mitochondria CLK1/MCLK1 acts as an hydroxylase and is implicated in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q or UQ), a lipid-like molecule primarily known as an electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and as a membrane antioxidant but which is also associated with an increasing number of different aspects of cellular metabolism (20Stepanyan Z. Hughes B. Cliche D.O. Camp D. Hekimi S. Exp. Gerontol. 2006; 41: 940-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Turunen M. Olsson J. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1660: 171-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that the long-lived Mclk1+/− mouse is a model of choice for the understanding of the links between mitochondrial energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and the aging process in mammals. Previous analysis of Mclk1+/− mice, which show the expected reduction of MCLK1 protein levels (22Levavasseur F. Miyadera H. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. Kita K. Shoubridge E. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46160-46164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), have revealed that their tissues as well as their mitochondria contain normal levels of UQ at 3 months of age (23Lapointe J. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26217-26227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Yet the same study also revealed a host of phenotypes induced by Mclk1 heterozygosity (see below). Thus, it appears that MCLK1 has an additional function that is unrelated to UQ biosynthesis but responsible for the phenotypes observed in young Mclk1+/− mutants. This is consistent with several results from nematodes which also strongly suggest that CLK-1 has other functions (24Branicky R. Nguyen P.A. Hekimi S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3976-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Hihi A.K. Kebir H. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41013-41018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In depth characterization of the phenotype of young Mclk1+/− mutants has revealed that the reduction of MCLK1 levels in these animals profoundly alters their mitochondrial function despite the fact that UQ production is unaffected (23Lapointe J. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26217-26227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In fact, we have shown that Mclk1 heterozygosity induces a severe impairment of mitochondrial energy metabolism as revealed by a reduction in the rates of mitochondrial electron transport and oxygen consumption as well as in ATP synthesis and ATP levels in both the mitochondria and the whole cell. ATP levels in several organs were surprisingly strongly affected with, for example, a 50% reduction of overall cellular ATP levels in the livers of Mclk1+/− mutants (23Lapointe J. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26217-26227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have found that the Mclk1+/− mice sustain high mitochondrial oxidative stress by a variety of measurements, including aconitase activity, protein carbonylation, and ROS production (23Lapointe J. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26217-26227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have shown that this early mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with a reduction in some aspects of cytosolic oxidative damage and global oxidative stress that can be measured via recognized plasma biomarkers such as 8-isoprostanes and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Considering that the accumulation of global oxidative damage is known to be tightly linked to the aging process (26Sohal R.S. Weindruch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar), this latter result suggests that the anti-aging effect triggered by low MCLK1 levels might already act at a young age. To further investigate the clk-1/Mclk1-dependent mechanism of aging as well as to try to elucidate the still unclear relation between mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and aging, we have now carefully analyzed the evolution of the phenotype of Mclk1+/− mutants over time. We have also studied the effects of reduced MCLK1 levels on the phenotype of mice heterozygous for the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (Sod2), which represent a well known model of mitochondrial oxidative stress (27Williams M.D. Van Remmen H. Conrad C.C. Huang T.T. Epstein C.J. Richardson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28510-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In addition of confirming the long lifespan phenotype of the Mclk1+/− mutants in a mixed background (129S6 x BALB/c), we also report here a study of mutants and controls on a completely isogenic background where we find that the condition of Mclk1+/− mutants unexpectedly results in protection against the age-dependent loss of mitochondrial function. Moreover, we found that the mutants are characterized by a significant attenuation of the age-associated increase in global oxidative stress normally observed in mammals. We also show that the Mclk1+/− condition can gradually reverse the deterioration of mitochondrial function and the associated increase of global oxidative stress that is normally observed in Sod2+/− mutants. Thus, this study provides for a unique vertebrate model in which reduced levels of a specific mitochondrial protein causes early mitochondrial dysfunction but has long term beneficial effects that slow down the rate of aging, as established with appropriate biomarkers, and can ultimately prolong lifespan in mice. Furthermore, in line with recent studies that have raised doubts about the validity of the mitochondrial oxidative stress theory of aging (4Muller F.L. Lustgarten M.S. Jang Y. Richardson A. Van Remmen H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 43: 477-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 8Andziak B. O'Connor T.P. Qi W. DeWaal E.M. Pierce A. Chaudhuri A.R. Van Remmen H. Buffenstein R. Aging Cell. 2006; 5: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 10Pérez V.I. Van Remmen H. Bokov A. Epstein C.J. Vijg J. Richardson A. Aging Cell. 2009; 8: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), our results, which relate to a recognized long-lived mice model, represent a novel and crucial indication that mitochondrial oxidative stress might not by itself be causal to aging. All of the mice were housed in a pathogen-free animal facility at McGill University and were given a standard rodent diet and water ad libitum. At the time of analysis animals were anesthetized, sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and perfused with phosphate buffer. Tissues were then rapidly removed, rinsed, and placed in ice-cold mitochondrial isolation buffer or immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. All procedures were approved by McGill's Animal Care and Ethics committees. The mice were separated from their mother at 21 days of age and housed 3–5 per cage, with both genotypes present in each cage. Lifespan was determined by recording the age of spontaneous death or when one of the following criteria was met: unresponsiveness to touch, slow respiration, coldness to touch, a hunched up position with matted fur, sudden weight loss, or the presence of a tumor large enough to inhibit the animal's normal behavior. All of the mice used in the experiments comparing animals of different ages (3, 12, and 23 months) were F1 hybrid progeny generated by crossing mice of two different pure inbred strains. Indeed, these animals were produced by mating Mclk1+/− males from the original knock-out background (129S6) to females on a pure BALB/c background. These animals were, therefore, all genetically identical (isogenic) except at the Mclk1 locus. In contrast, all mice used in the survival curves analysis were from a mixed background derived at an earlier time (18Liu X. Jiang N. Hughes B. Bigras E. Shoubridge E. Hekimi S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) from the same two backgrounds that were used to produce the isogenic F1 mice. Note that the original knock-out background was previous described as 129/SvJ (22Levavasseur F. Miyadera H. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. Kita K. Shoubridge E. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46160-46164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However recent changes in nomenclature mean that it should now more correctly be called 129S6/SvEvTac, which can be abbreviated to 129S6. The F1 animals of the mutant and wild-type groups were siblings and were co-housed immediately after weaning. Because homozygous Sod2−/− mice have the longest survival in the DBA/2J/B6 F1 background (29Huang T.T. Johnson M.S. Figueroa-Colon R. Dwyer J.H. Goran M.I. Obes. Res. 2001; 9: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we generated the Sod2+/− Mclk1+/− double mutant mice used in the present study by mating Sod2+/− Mclk1+/− mice in the C57BL/6J background to DBA/2J wild-type animals to create a mixed background. The extraction of quinones as well as their quantification by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were performed as described previously (18Liu X. Jiang N. Hughes B. Bigras E. Shoubridge E. Hekimi S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The total amount of quinone was normalized to the amount of protein. On the day of the experiment fresh livers were homogenized in 10 volumes (w/v) of an homogenization buffer consisting of 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA. Liver mitochondria were then isolated by standard differential centrifugation according to detailed procedures described elsewhere (30Sohal R.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The purity of the mitochondrial as well as cytosolic preparations obtained was then checked with antisera against porin and α-tubulin as reported previously (23Lapointe J. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26217-26227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption of isolated mitochondria was measured polarographically with a Clark-type oxygen electrode connected to a suitable recorder (Yellow Springs Instrument Co.) by following published procedures (23Lapointe J. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26217-26227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the presence of substrates and ADP (0.8 mm) is reported as state 3, whereas the state corresponding to the period after all added ADP has been converted into ATP or in the presence of 1.25 mg/ml oligomycin is defined as state 4 respiration (Table 1). The respiratory control ratio (state 3/state 4) and the adenosine diphosphate-to-oxygen ratio (ADP/O), which are indicators of the intactness of the inner mitochondrial membrane and of the level of coupling of mitochondrial respiration, have been measured for all the animals used in the aging study (Table 1). Also, the quality of mitochondria preparation was confirmed by at least a 3-fold increase in respiration rate in the presence of the uncoupler.TABLE 1Mitochondrial oxygen consumption parameters3 months12 months23 monthsMalesFemalesMalesFemalesMalesFemalesMclk1+/+Mclk1+/−Mclk1+/+Mclk1+/−Mclk1+/+Mclk1+/−Mclk1+/+Mclk1+/−Mclk1+/+Mclk1+/−Mclk1+/+Mclk1+/−O2 consumption state 4 (glutamate) (nmol/mg/min)31.8 ± 3.1aData are the means ± S.E. of 8–12 samples.27.8 ± 1.728.9 ± 2.127.5 ± 0.534 ± 2.732 ± 1.431 ± 2.434 ± 1.929.2 ± 1.531.1 ± 1.828.4 ± 0.627.8 ± 2.9O2 consumption state 4 (succinate) (nmol/mg/min)102 ± 7.8101.1 ± 693.5 ± 3.497.9 ± 3.4104 ± 3.799.6 ± 4.999.8 ± 3.895.6 ± 488.5 ± 3.390.8 ± 4.796.7 ± 4.3103.3 ± 5RCR (glutamate)7.3 ± 0.76.9 ± 0.57.5 ± 0.46.1 ± 0.4bSignificantly different from the controls (Mclk1+/+) at p < 0.05.6 ± 0.45.6 ± 0.3bSignificantly different from the controls (Mclk1+/+) at p < 0.05.6.3 ± 0.65.5 ± 0.46.1 ± 0.56.4 ± 0.55.1 ± 0.35.9 ± 0.6RCR (succinate)3.8 ± 0.23.5 ± 0.14.1 ± 0.23.2 ± 0.2bSignificantly different from the controls (Mclk1+/+) at p < 0.05.3.1 ± 0.22.7 ± 0.23.8 ± 0.23.4 ± 0.23.1 ± 0.23.6 ± 0.23.2 ± 0.23.3 ± 0.2ADP/O (glutamate)3 ± 0.13 ± 0.12.6 ± 0.22.8 ± 0.23 ± 0.082.9 ± 0.062.8 ± 0.072.9 ± 0.23.1 ± 0.063.1 ± 0.052.7 ± 0.12.9 ± 0.1ADP/O (succinate)2 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.12 ± 0.22 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.082 ± 0.072 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.071.8 ± 0.051.7 ± 0.061.7 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.07a Data are the means ± S.E. of 8–12 samples.b Significantly different from the controls (Mclk1+/+) at p < 0.05.

Polizio A.H. Erario M.A. Tomaro M.L. World J. Gastroenterol. 2005; 11: 3533-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, one volume of cytosolic or mitochondrial fraction (0.1 ml of sample and 0.4 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3) was mixed with a 0.5 volume of trichloroacetic acid (150 mg/ml) and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was mixed with 0.5 ml of thiobarbituric acid (0.7 mg/ml) and boiled for 15 min. After cooling, absorbance was measured at 535 nm on a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. MDA concentration was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 1.56 × 105 mol/liter·cm. Results were expressed in nmol of MDA/mg of protein (determined using Bio-Rad Bradford kit). The level of protein carbonyl contents in liver tissues was determined with the Protein Carbonyl Assay kit (Cayman Chemical) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasma free and esterified 8-isoprostanes were quantified with an 8-isoprostanes enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical) according to the provided protocol. The plasma levels of 8-OHdG, a biomarker for oxidative damage to DNA, were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stressgen). Aconitase activity in liver mitochondrial and cytosolic extracts was determined as described elsewhere (32Nulton-Persson A.C. Szweda L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23357-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). SOD2 activity was assessed in presence of 1 mm KCN using a commercially available kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman Chemical). All activities were normalized to the quantity of proteins used in the assays. Comparisons between Mclk1+/+ and Mclk1+/− as well as between Sod2+/− and Sod2+/− Mclk1+/− animals were performed using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test, and differences between the two genotypes were considered to be significant when p was <0.05. Statistical comparisons between control Sod2+/+ Mclk1+/+ mice and each of the three other genotypes individually have been performed by using a one-way analysis of variance followed by the Dunnett's post-hoc test, and the differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05. For evaluating survival data, the log-rank (Mandel-Cox) test was performed using GraphPad Prism Version 5.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego. The Gompertz equation, Rm = R0eat, where Rm is the mortality rate as a function of time or age (t), R0 is the nonexponential factor in mortality, and a is the exponential (Gompertz) mortality rate coefficient, used to model the aging process. The linear regression was obtained from ln(Rm) = ln(R0) + αt and the mortality rate doubling time, a measure of the rate of aging, was estimated from the slope as described (33de Magalhães J.P. Cabral J.A. Magalhães D. Genetics. 2005; 169: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In a previous study (18Liu X. Jiang N. Hughes B. Bigras E. Shoubridge E. Hekimi S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) in which the effect of Mclk1 heterozygosity on three genetic backgrounds was examined, we found that Mclk1+/− mutants from a mixed background (129S6 x BALB/c) showed the greatest increase in lifespan (31% longer on average). However, because the sample sizes examined were relatively small and contained both sexes in unequal ratios, we have carried out a new study with larger cohorts to verify that Mclk1 heterozygosity could indeed increase the average and maximum lifespan, as the earlier results suggested. We scored the lifespan of 14 Mclk1+/+ mice, of which 8 were males, and of 54 Mclk1+/− mutants, of which 24 were males. The two survival curves (not shown) were different by the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test (p = 0.0231). There was no significant difference of survival between the sexes within each genotype. As there was also no significant difference for each genotype between the previous data and the new data, we pooled the data from the two experiments for the best possible visualization of the difference of survival between the genotypes in this background. In Fig. 1A, males are identified with red symbols, and the symbols corresponding to animals from the previous dataset are marked with an asterisk. The median survival for the pooled samples was 764 days with a maximum of 915 days for Mclk1+/+ animals and 900 days with a maximum of 1180 for the Mclk1+/− mutants. The survival curves were different by the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test (p = 0.0008). Visually, the two curves are strikingly different, with the wild-type animals all dying within a relatively short period, but the mutants showing a much greater diversity of survival, including animals that died substantially before any wild-type animal and animals that lived considerably longer than any wild-type animal. Furthermore, we used the data from the survival curve in the Gompertz model, which is commonly used to evaluate the intrinsic rate of mortality in different populations (34Riggs J.E. Millecchia R.J. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1992; 62: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). From the Gompertz analysis we obtained the mortality rate doubling time, a recognized measure of the rate of aging (33de Magalhães J.P. Cabral J.A. Magalhães D. Genetics. 2005; 169: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and we found that it was significantly different between the cohorts (0.23 year for the Mclk1+/+ animals and 0.41 year for the Mclk1+/− mutants). This suggests that the Mclk1+/− mutants have indeed a slower rate of aging. We have shown previously that various tissues from 3-month-old Mclk1+/− mice in several genetic backgrounds exhibit the expected decrease in Mclk1 mRNA and MCLK1 protein levels but that whole tissue homogenates as well as mitochondrial extracts from the same organs display no reduction in either UQ9 or UQ10 levels (22Levavasseur F.

Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26217-26227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This has revealed that MCLK1 has an additional activity unrelated to UQ biosynthesis but necessary for normal mitochondrial function. Here, we have used HPLC to determine the levels of quinones in liver mitochondria of young isogenic animals from an additional genetic background, 129S6 x BALB/c, in both 3- and 23-month-old F1 animals to determine whether quinone content changes with age. As in the previously investigated backgrounds, the UQ9 levels were unaffected by Mclk1 heterozygosity in 3-month-old mice (Fig. 1B). In addition, we also found no differences in UQ9 levels between Mclk1+/− and Mclk1+/+ mice at 23 months of age (Fig. 1C). We have analyzed mitochondrial function in young (3 months), middle-aged (12 months), and old (23 months) F1 males and females from the 129S6 x BALB/c cross. Mitochondria isolated from both genotypes are well coupled as revealed by standard respiratory control ratio and ADP/O ratio values, and no significant differences between the genotypes was observed for state 4 respiration (Table 1). In wild-type Mclk1+/+ controls from both sexes, oxygen consumption of isolated mitochondria measured in the presence of ADP was found to decrease with increasing age (Fig. 2), as has been found in other studies (1Navarro A. Boveris A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C670-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 35Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10771-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that the rate of oxygen consumption from intact isolated liver mitochondria was reduced with both complex I substrates (glutamate in combination with malate) and a complex II substrate (succinate) in 3-month-old Mclk1+/− males from the BALB/c and the C57BL/6J backgrounds and that these defects in oxidative phosphorylation are accompanied by reduced ATP production (23Lapointe J. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26217-26227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We show here that this phenotype of low oxygen consumption with both types of substrates is also observe in young males and females originating from the 129S6 x BALB/c cross (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we found that this difference between both genotypes persist in 12-month animals as the mitochondria isolated from Mclk1+/− mutants also consumed less oxygen than the controls with all studied substrates. However, after 23 months, the age-dependent decrease in oxygen consumption in Mcl"

The functional importance of C/EBPβ during adipocyte development has already been demonstrated: overexpression of C/EBPβ in the nonpreadipocyte line of NIH 3T3 causes the commitment to the adipocyte lineage (12.Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), and overexpression of C/EBPβ in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes is sufficient to induce adipocyte differentiation without hormonal inducers normally required (13.Yeh W.C.

C/EBPβ contains a C-terminal basic region leucine zipper DNA-binding domain, a dimerization domain, and an N-terminal transactivation domain together with a regulation domain (RD), which contains multiple putative modification sites in the middle. C/EBPβ assumes a tightly folded conformation in which the activation domain (N-terminal) and DNA-binding domain (C-terminal) are obscured by interaction with the RD. Appropriate modifications disrupt the RD interaction rending the binding domain accessible for DNA binding and thereby facilitating transactivation. Three phosphorylation sites (Thr188, Ser184, and Thr179) have been identified in this RD region of C/EBPβ during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation (14.Tang Q.Q. Grønborg M. Huang H. Kim J.W. Otto T.C.

Both ex vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that phosphorylation on Thr188 (first by MAPK during G1 phase and late by CyclinA/cdk2 (15.Li X. Kim J.W. Grønborg M. Urlaub H. Lane M.D. Tang Q.Q.

Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is a novel glycosylation in which the monosaccharide β-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) attaches to serine/threonine residues via an O-linked glycosidic bond and is found mostly within the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm (18.Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8049-8057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GlcNAcylation regulates several important cellular processes, such as signal transduction, protein expression, degradation, and trafficking (19.Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). This post-translational modification is regulated by two highly conserved enzymes: OGT and O-GlcNAcase (β-N-acetylglucosaminidase), whereas OGT catalyzes the attachment and O-GlcNAcase catalyzes the removal of O-GlcNAc to proteins (20.Kreppel L.K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Cycling of O-GlcNAc is dynamically regulated in a manner similar to phosphorylation. O-GlcNAc and O-phosphate site-mapping studies suggest that there are several different types of dynamic interplay between O-GlcNAc and O-phosphate: 1) competitive occupancy at the same site; 2) competitive and alternative occupancy at proximal sites; 3) a complex interplay whereby some O-phosphate attachment sites on a given protein are the same as some O-GlcNAc sites, whereas others are adjacent to, or even distant from each other; and 4) phosphorylation regulates the O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes and O-GlcNAc regulates kinases (19.Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II is extensively GlcNAcylated (22.Kelly W.G. Dahmus M.E. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10416-10424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and almost all RNA polymerase II transcription factors are modified by the sugar. GlcNAcylation can either suppress or enhance transcription, depending on the promoter involved, on the cell system, and on associations with different co-factors (23.Yang X. Zhang F. Kudlow J.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 24.Housely M.P. Rodgers J.T. Udeshi N.D. Kelly T.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Puigserver P. Hart G.W. J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4324-4332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), acetylated (26.Ceseña T.I. Cui T.X. Subramanian L. Fulton C.T. Iñiguez-Lluhí J.A. Kwok R.P. Schartz J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2008; 289: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and sumoylated (27.Eaton E.M. Sealy L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33416-33421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study, we find that C/EBPβ is GlcNAcylated on Ser180 and Ser181, which is in the RD region and adjacent to the phosphorylation sites (Thr188, Ser184, and Thr179) required for the gain of DNA binding activity. GlcNAcylation on Ser180 and Ser181 prevent the phosphorylation on Thr188, Ser184, and Thr179. Mutations of Ser180 and Ser181 to alanine residues significantly increase the transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ. This suggests that GlcNAcylation regulates both the phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of C/EBPβ, and GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation regulate the transcriptional activities of C/EBPβ in a competitive way and by alternative occupancy at adjacent sites. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were propagated and maintained in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) calf serum as described (30.Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To induce differentiation, 2-day postconfluent preadipocytes (designated day 0) were fed DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1 μg/ml insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine until day 2. The cells were then fed DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml insulin for 2 days, after which they were fed every other day with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. To test the effect of GlcNAcylation on the C/EBPβ phosphorylation and subsequently adipocyte differentiation, the post-confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with O-GlcNAcase inhibitor, GlcNAc thialzoline (GT; Johns Hopkins Medical Chemical Core) 1 h before and at the time exposed to the differentiation inducers. At the various times indicated, whole cell lysates were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected with antibodies against total C/EBPβ, phospho-C/EBPβ, PPARγ, and 422/aP2 antibodies; relative protein levels were quantitated and plotted. A C/EBPα promoter report construct was made by cloning 2044 bp of the mouse C/EBPα promoter into luciferase vector pGL3.0. C/EBPβ expression vectors were prepared by cloning wild type mouse C/EBPβ cDNA or mutants (Ser180 → Ala and/or Ser181 →Ala) into pcDNA3.1, and the mutants were generated by using Stratagene Quick change site-directed mutagenesis kit. After reaching 90% confluency, 3T3-L1 cells were transfected with equal amount of report construct and/or C/EBPβ expression vectors, a thymidine kinase Renilla luciferase construct (Promega) was co-transfected and used as transfection efficiency control. Two days after transfection, the cells were induced as above, and 36 h after induction cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined by dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against C/EBPβ, Thr(P)-188-C/EBPβ (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverley, MA), CTD110.6, 422/aP2, and PPARγ (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody against C/EBPβ and 422a/P2 were prepared in this laboratory. CTD110.6 was used for O-GlcNAc detection (from Dr. G. W. Hart's lab). The cDNA encoding full-length C/EBPβ-LAP protein and the C-terminal 152–289 amino acids of C/EBPβ-LIP were cloned into the downstream of GST gene in pGEX-6P (Amersham Biosciences) and transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen). A single colony was propagated overnight in 3 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol, and then diluted (1:100) into 500 ml of fresh LB medium the next day and cultured until an A600 of 0.6–0.7 was reached. Expression of the fusion proteins was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h, and the cells were harvested and resuspended in 25 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100. After lysis by one cycle of freezing-thawing, the cell suspension was treated with DNase I and RNase A and then incubated on ice for 10 min in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl and 5 mm dithiothreitol to dissociate DNA-protein complex. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, 250–500 μl of bed volume of GSH-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) was added to the supernatant and mixed overnight in a cold room. The beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, washed once with PreScission cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and then treated with 80 units of PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) in 960 μl of buffer. The cleaved recombinant C/EBPβ protein was further purified by CM-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), and soluble, highly purified recombinant protein was eluted at 250–300 mm of NaCl. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay, and the purity of protein was verified by SDS-PAGE. Two micrograms of recombinant C/EBPβ-LAP were incubated with activated MAPK (Calbiochem) and GSK3β (Upstate) in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm cold ATP or 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (1 Ci = 37 GBq) at 30 °C for 30 min. The phosphorylation was detected with Thr(P)188 phospho-specific antibody or by autoradiography after the protein was separated by SDS-PAGE. For identification of phosphorylation sites on C/EBPβ, similar experiments were performed with 0.5 mm ATP. The protein band containing C/EBPβ was excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry as previously described (26.Ceseña T.I.

To investigate the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on the O-phosphorylation of C/EBPβ, GST-C/EBPβ-LAP fusion protein (which bound to the GSH-Sepharose) was used as substrate, GST-C/EBPβ-LAP was GlcNAcylated by OGT first and then used for substrate for in vitro phosphorylation as described above, at times indicated reactions were stopped by adding loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE, the phosphorylation was detected by Western blotting with Thr(P)188 phospho-specific antibody or autoradiography (detecting of all phosphorylation). Two μg of recombinant C/EBPβ was incubated with 1 μg of recombinant OGT in buffer containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 35 mm NaF, 2 μm 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-gluconohydroximolacetone, 2.5 mm AMP, and 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc (or 1 μCi of [3H[UDP-GlcNAc) at 25 °C for 60 min. The GlcNAcylation was detected by Western blotting with O-GlcNAc-specific antibody CTD110.6 or autoradiography after the protein was separated by SDS-PAGE. For identification of O-GlcNAcylation sites on C/EBPβ, the protein band containing C/EBPβ was excised from the gel and destained. The protein bands were digested overnight with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI), and then the peptides were extracted and lyophilized. For some samples, the generated tryptic peptides were subjected to a second digestion using chymotrypsin. In those cases the tryptic peptides were redissolved in 16 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 10 ng/μl of high purity bovine pancreas chymotrypsin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). The second part of this sequential digestion was also allowed to proceed overnight. All of the digestions were stopped with acetic acid. Lyophilized peptides was redissolved in 20 μl of 3% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid prior to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Mass spectrometry analyses were performed using a ion trap fitted with a chip cube LC system and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) capability (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), as previously described. The ion trap was operated in 1) MS followed by alternating CID and ETD, 2) MS only; or 3) ETD only on selected precursors. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated as above and harvested at the indicated time. C/EBPβ was immunoprecipitated, washed with lysis buffer, and washed twice with reaction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 μm 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-gluconohydroximolacetone, and 5 mm MnCl2 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Next, 2 μl of Gal-T1 Y289L (Invitrogen) and 2 μl of 0.5 mm UDP-GalNAz (Invitrogen) were added to a reaction volume of 20 μl. The reaction was performed overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with reaction buffer to remove excess UDP-GalNAz. The sampled were then reacted with biotin-alkyne (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The enzymatic reactions were eluted with Laemmli buffer for immunoblot analysis. ChIP analysis was performed essentially as described in the protocol of ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained and induced to differentiate as above. O-GlcNAcase inhibitor (GT; Johns Hopkins Medical Chemical Core) was added 1 h before and added again at the time of induction. At various times indicated, the cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The cross-linked cells were harvested, lysed in SDS lysis buffer, and sonicated. After incubation with salmon sperm DNA-protein A overnight at 4 °C, the DNA-protein complexes in the supernatant were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against C/EBPβ, and the immune complexes were recovered by adding protein A-agarose. After series washing, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated, redissolved, and used as a template for PCR with the following primers. The primers used to amplify the DNA fragments containing the C/EBP-binding site in C/EBPα promoter: TCCCTAGTGTTGGCTGGAAG and CAGTAGGATGGTGCCTGCTG. C/EBPβ has two isoforms (liver activation protein (LAP) and liver inhibitory protein (LIP); Fig. 1A) both of which are derived from the same mRNA by using different translation start codons (28.Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). These two isoforms share the same DNA-binding domain and leucine zipper domain in their C terminus and the RD in the upstream of DNA-binding domain, whereas LAP has a transactivation domain in the N terminus and LIP does not. After treatment with OGT and unlabeled UDP-GlcNAc, both recombinant LAP and LIP are GlcNAcylated as evidenced by Western blotting with O-GlcNAc specific antibody CTD110.6 (Fig. 1, B and C, middle panels), and incubation with OGT and 3H-UDP-GlcNAc labels both LAP and LIP well, as indicated by autoradiography (Fig. 1, B and C, bottom panels). These data indicate that C/EBPβ can be GlcNAcylated and that the residue or residues very likely are located in the DNA-binding and/or regulation domain of C/EBPβ, which is shared by both LAP and LIP. By combining ETD and CID mass spectrometry with liquid chromatography, we were able to map GlcNAcylation sites as well as O-linked phosphorylations of C/EBPβ. We used CID to identify peptides showing a characteristic fragment pattern for O-GlcNAc-modified peptides and ETD to pin-point the modified residue(s) of these peptides. After treatment with OGT and cold UDP-GlcNAc, C/EBPβ (LAP) were purified by SDS-PAGE. The C/EBPβ-LAP protein band was excised and trypsinized. A triply charged tryptic peptide AYLGYQATPSGSSGSLSTSSSSSPPGTPSPADAK was found to be a O-GlcNAc-modified peptide. However, because of the high number of potential modified residues (14 residues) neither CID nor ETD allowed us to accurately pin-point the modified residue. By subjecting the already trypsinized sample to a second digestion, this time using chymotrypsin, we were able to create smaller peptides carrying five and nine potential modified residues, respectively, thereby greatly simplifying our task. Peptides with the sequence STSSSSSPPGTPSPADAK showed the GlcNAcylation fragmentation characteristics and were selected for ETD-based GlcNAcylation site mapping. The same sequence was found to carry either one or two O-GlcNAc-modified residues. When carrying one O-GlcNAc, the modified residue was assigned as Ser180. When carrying two O-GlcNAc modifications, the modified residues were pin-pointed as Ser180 and Ser181. Fig. 2 shows the ETD spectra of the modified peptides. Fig. 2A shows the unmodified peptide, whereas the spectra of peptides carrying one and two O-GlcNAc units are shown in B and C. GlcNAcylation on Ser180 and Ser181 are in the RD region of C/EBPβ and adjacent to three phosphorylation sites (Thr179, Ser184, and Thr188) we identified before (14.Tang Q.Q. Grønborg M. Huang H. Kim J.W. Otto T.C. Pandey A. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9766-9771Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To confirm and extend our previous study, C/EBPβ-LAP was phosphorylated with MAPK and GSK3β, and phosphorylations on Thr188, Ser184 (Fig. 2, D and E), and Thr179 (data not shown) were confirmed. Because the phosphorylations on Thr188, Ser184, and Thr179 are required for C/EBPβ to gain the DNA binding activity, the question was raised as to whether GlcNAcylation will affect the DNA binding activity. Recombinant C/EBPβ-LAP was phosphorylated with MAPK and GSK3β (or GlcNAcylated with OGT), and the phosphorylation was confirmed by Western blotting with Thr(P)188 phospho-specific antibody (Fig. 3B) and mass spectrometry analysis (similar to Fig. 2, D and E, and data not shown). GlcNAcylation was confirmed by Western blotting with O-GlcNAc specific antibody CTD110.6 (Fig. 3C). Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis was performed to compare the DNA binding activity; consistent with our previous findings (14.Tang Q.Q. Grønborg M. Huang H. Kim J.W. Otto T.C. Pandey A. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9766-9771Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), unmodified C/EBPβ-LAP had little or no DNA binding activity, whereas the DNA binding activity dramatically increased after phosphorylation by MAPK and GSK3β (Fig. 3D). GlcNAcylated C/EBPβ-LAP did not bind to the C/EBP consensus sequence similar to unmodified C/EBPβ-LAP (Fig. 3D). GlcNAcylation (Ser180 and Ser181) and phosphorylation (Thr179, Ser184, and Thr188) do not occur on the same sites but occur very close to each other; next we asked whether these two different post-translational modifications could influence each other. To test this, GST-fused C/EBPβ-LAP was first GlcNAcylated and then used as the in vitro substrate for MAPK and GSK3β. We found that phosphorylation was significantly decreased and delayed as indicated by Western blotting (detecting Thr(P)188) (Fig. 4) and autodiography (detecting all phosphorylations; data not shown). A chemoenzymatic approach (29.Khidekel N. Arndt S. Lamarre-Vincent N. Lippert A. Poulin-Kerstien K.G. Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. Hsieh-Wilson L.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 16162-16163Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) was used to confirm GlcNAcylation on the endogenous C/EBPβ. Growth-arrested 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiation, and endogenous C/EBPβ was purified with immunoaffinify column (14.Tang Q.Q. Grønborg M. Huang H. Kim J.W. Otto T.C. Pandey A. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9766-9771Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), labeled by using a mutant galactosyltransferase GalT1 Y289L and an azide derivative of UDP-Gal (UDP-GalNAz) as donor substrate. The resulting azide-labeled C/EBPβ was chemically tagged with biotin-alkyne, and GlcNAcylation was detected by Western blotting with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. We found that C/EBPβ-LAP was strongly labeled with biotin, confirming the presence of O- GlcNAc in this protein (Fig. 5). To further test whether GlcNAcylation prevents phosphorylation of C/EBPβ in vivo, the GlcNAcylation of whole cell proteins was elevated, and the effects on the phosphorylation and DNA binding activity were investigated. After treatment with O-GlcNAcase inhibitor (GlcNAc-Thiazoline, GT), the GlcNAcylation of total cell proteins was significantly increased as detected by Western blotting with O-GlcNAc specific antibody CTD110.6 (Fig. 6C), we found that whole C/EBPβ protein level is increased (Fig. 6A) while relative phospho-C/EBPβ protein is decreased (Fig. 6, B and E), which indicates the ratio of phosphorylated C/EBPβ to total C/EBPβ is decreased (Fig. 6E). The ratio change was not due to the change in MAPK activity, which is responsible for the phosphorylation, and the phosphorylation and activation of MAPK indicated by p-MAPK, since p-MAPK was not affected by the O- GlcNAcase inhibitor (GT) (Fig. 6F).FIGURE 6O-GlcNAcase inhibitor (GT) decreases the ratio of phospho-C/EBPβ to total C/EBPβ in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The post-confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with O-GlcNAcase inhibitor (GT) 1 h before and at the time exposed to the differentiation inducers. At various times indicated, whole cell lysates were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected with antibodies against total C/EBPβ (A), phospho-C/EBPβ (B), O-GlcNAc (C), and MAPK and p-MAPK (F). The Coomassie Blue stain image was used to indicate the loading control (D); and phospho-C/EBPβ and total C/EBPβ were quantified and relative ratio was plotted in E. All of the experiments were repeated three times, and the data were statistical analyzed by using the Student's t test. *, 0.01 < p values < 0.05; **, p values < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ChIP analysis was performed to test whether O-GlcNAcase inhibitor (GT) treatment also affected the DNA binding activity of C/EBPβ after the phospho-C/EBPβ was decreased. Postconfluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with/out GT and 24 h later cells were cross-linked, and ChIP analysis was performed on the DNA binding activity of C/EBPβ on the C/EBPα promoter. We found that the binding of C/EBPβ to the C/EBP element in C/EBPα promoter was significantly decreased (Fig. 7A) after relative phospho-C/EBPβ was decreased, and treatment with the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor (GT) delays the 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation program as evidenced by decreasing the expression of PPARγ and 422/aP2 ∼20–30% after 48 and 72 h of MDI induction; however, the expression catches up at 96 h after MDI induction (Fig. 7, C and D). Ser180 and Ser181 were also mutated to further investigate the function role of GlcNAcylation on C/EBPβ. We found that C/EBPβ can significantly transactivate C/EBPα promoter reporter, but neither mutant of S180A nor mutant of S181A alone had any effect. However, mutations on both Ser180 and Ser181 dramatically increased the transactivation of C/EBPβ (Fig. 7B). We have used tandem mass spectrometry to identify the O-GlcNAc residues on C/EBPβ. Although this approach in most cases is very sensitive and accurate, O-GlcNAc-modified residues can be challenging to pin-point. First, enrichment of peptides carrying this modification is far from trivial, and second the O-GlcNAc modification is very labile when subjected to CID, making it difficult to accurately assign the modified residue(s) (31.Wang Z. Park K. Comer F. Hsieh-Wilson L.C. Saudek C.D. Hart G.W. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To address the latter point, we decided to combine ETD and CID with liquid chromatography to map GlcNAcylation sites as well as O-linked phosphorylations of C/EBPβ. This newer fragmentation technique has proven to be an excellent choice to study so-called labile modifications exemplified by O-linked phosphorylations and O-GlcNAc (24.Housely M.P. Rodgers J.T. Udeshi N.D. Kelly T.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Puigserver P. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 16283-16292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We provide clear mass spectrometry data to show that C/EBPβ is GlcNAcylated on Ser180 and Ser181 by OGT and phosphorylated on Thr188/Ser184/Thr179 by MAPK and GSK3β (Fig. 2). Increasing evidence indicates that most RNA polymerase II transcriptional factors are modified by both phosphorylation and GlcNAcylation, whereas phosphorylation and GlcNAcylation often reciprocally regulate the activities of these transcriptional factors (32.Comer F.I. Hart G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7845-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). c-Myc is a helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor. Ser62 and Thr58 are identified as phosphorylation sites, and phosphorylation on Ser62 by MAPK primes the phosphorylation on Thr58 by GSK3β. Thr58 is also identified as the major GlcNAcylation site of c-Myc. Thr58 is located in the transactivation domain, and the competitive occupancy at this amino acid (Thr58) plays an important role in regulation of the functions of c-Myc (33.Kamemura K. Hayes B.K. Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19229-19235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). FoxO1 is an important transcription factor regulating broad gene expression programs including metabolism, cell cycle, longevity, and stress response. The phosphorylation of FoxO1 by insulin signaling pathway has been well characterized, and phosphorylations on Thr24/Ser256/Ser319 exclude the FoxO1 from nucleus. FoxO1 is also GlcNAcylated, and the GlcNAcylation sites are mapped to Thr317/Ser550/Thr648/Ser656. Further evidence demonstrates that the phosphorylation sites do not overlap directly with but are adjacent to the GlcNAcylation sites, suggesting a complex interplay between phosphorylation and GlcNAcylation of FoxO1. Interestingly, the GlcNAcylation of FoxO1 increases its transactivation capability in response to high glucose (24.Housely M.P. Rodgers J.T. Udeshi N.D. Kelly T.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Puigserver P. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 16283-16292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Our previous data demonstrate that the transcription factor C/EBPβ is sequentially phosphorylated on Thr188/Ser184/Thr179, which is similar to c-Myc; phosphorylation on Thr188 by MAPK or CyclinA/cdk2 primes the phosphorylations on Ser184/Thr179 by GSK3β; and phosphorylations on Thr188/Ser184/Thr179 are required for the acquisition of DNA binding activity by C/EBPβ. In this paper we demonstrate that C/EBPβ is also modified by O-GlcNAc (Fig. 1), and the GlcNAcylation sites are on Ser180 and Ser181 (Fig. 2), which are very close to its phosphorylation sites (Thr188, Ser184, and Thr179) and both of which are located in the RD of C/EBPβ. Although GlcNAcylation itself does not affect the DNA binding activity in vitro (Fig. 3), it prevents the phosphorylations (Fig. 4). C/EBPβ is GlcNAcylated during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 5), and elevation of GlcNAcylation significantly decreases the phosphorylation (Fig. 6) as well as the DNA binding activity of C/EBPβ in vivo (Fig. 7A), subsequently delaying the adipocyte differentiation program (Fig. 7, B and C). Importantly mutations on Ser180 and Ser181 significantly increase the transactivation activity of C/EBPβ detected by C/EBPα promoter reporter assay (Fig. 7B), indicating that blocking of GlcNAcylation favors the phosphorylations. We conclude that GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation act in a competitive manner and by alternative occupancy at adjacent sites to regulate the function of C/EBPβ, which is similar to the situation with FoxO1."

RGS2 is unique in its in vitro potency and selectivity as a GAP for Gαq subunits. As many vasoconstrictive hormones signal via Gq heterotrimer-coupled receptors, it is perhaps not surprising that RGS2-deficient mice exhibit constitutive hypertension. However, to date the particular structural features within RGS2 determining its selectivity for Gαq over Gαi/o substrates have not been completely characterized. Here, we examine a trio of point mutations to RGS2 that elicits Gαi-directed binding and GAP activities without perturbing its association with Gαq. Using x-ray crystallography, we determined a model of the triple mutant RGS2 in complex with a transition state mimetic form of Gαi at 2.8-Å resolution. Structural comparison with unliganded, wild type RGS2 and of other RGS domain/Gα complexes highlighted the roles of these residues in wild type RGS2 that weaken Gαi subunit association. Moreover, these three amino acids are seen to be evolutionarily conserved among organisms with modern cardiovascular systems, suggesting that RGS2 arose from the R4-subfamily of RGS proteins to have specialized activity as a potent and selective Gαq GAP that modulates cardiovascular function. “Regulator of G-protein signaling” (RGS) proteins facilitate the termination of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling via their ability to increase the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of Gα subunits (known as GTPase-accelerating protein or “GAP” activity).

GPCRs are coupled to their underlying second messenger systems by heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (“G-proteins”) composed of three subunits: Gα, Gβ, and Gγ. Four general classes of Gα subunits have been defined based on functional couplings (in the GTP-bound state) to various effector proteins. Gs subfamily Gα subunits are stimulatory to membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases that generate the second messenger 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP); conversely, Gi subfamily Gα subunits are generally inhibitory to adenylyl cyclases (4.Sunahara R.K. Taussig R. Mol. Interv. 2002; 2: 168-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). G12/13 subfamily Gα subunits activate the small G-protein RhoA through stimulation of the GEF subfamily of RGS proteins, namely p115-RhoGEF, LARG, and PDZ-RhoGEF (5.Fukuhara S. Chikumi H.

GPCRs are coupled to their underlying second messenger systems by heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (“G-proteins”) composed of three subunits: Gα, Gβ, and Gγ. Four general classes of Gα subunits have been defined based on functional couplings (in the GTP-bound state) to various effector proteins. Gs subfamily Gα subunits are stimulatory to membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases that generate the second messenger 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP); conversely, Gi subfamily Gα subunits are generally inhibitory to adenylyl cyclases (4.Sunahara R.K. Taussig R. Mol. Interv. 2002; 2: 168-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). G12/13 subfamily Gα subunits activate the small G-protein RhoA through stimulation of the GEF subfamily of RGS proteins, namely p115-RhoGEF, LARG, and PDZ-RhoGEF (5.Fukuhara S. Chikumi H.

The duration of GPCR signaling is controlled by the time Gα remains bound to GTP before its hydrolysis to GDP. RGS proteins are key modulators of GPCR signaling by virtue of their ability to accelerate the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity of Gα subunits (reviewed in Refs. 9.Hollinger S. Hepler J.R.

https://openalex.org/W1966880532,"The 5q31-linked corneal dystrophies are heterogeneous autosomal-dominant eye disorders pathologically characterized by the progressive accumulation of aggregated proteinaceous deposits in the cornea, which manifests clinically as severe vision impairment. The 5q31-linked corneal dystrophies are commonly caused by mutations in the TGFBI (transforming growth factor-beta-induced) gene. However, despite the identification of the culprit gene, the cellular roles of TGFBI and the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of corneal dystrophy remain poorly understood. Here we report the identification of periostin, a molecule that is highly related to TGFBI, as a specific TGFBI-binding partner. The association of TGFBI and periostin is mediated by the amino-terminal cysteine-rich EMI domains of TGFBI and periostin. Our results indicate that the endogenous TGFBI and periostin colocalize within the trans-Golgi network and associate prior to secretion. The corneal dystrophy-associated R124H mutation in TGFBI severely impairs interaction with periostin in vivo. In addition, the R124H mutation causes aberrant redistribution of the mutant TGFBI into lysosomes. We also find that the periostin-TGFBI interaction is disrupted in corneal fibroblasts cultured from granular corneal dystrophy type II patients and that periostin accumulates in TGFBI-positive corneal deposits in granular corneal dystrophy type II (also known as Avellino corneal dystrophy). Together, our findings suggest that TGFBI and periostin may play cooperative cellular roles and that periostin may be involved in the pathogenesis of 5q31-linked corneal dystrophies."
https://openalex.org/W1983421391,"The orphan transporter Slc6a18 (XT2) is highly expressed at the luminal membrane of kidney proximal tubules and displays ∼50% identity with Slc6a19 (B0AT1), which is the main neutral amino acid transporter in both kidney and small intestine. As yet, the amino acid transport function of XT2 has only been experimentally supported by the urinary glycine loss observed in xt2 null mice. We report here that in Xenopus laevis oocytes, co-expressed ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) associates with XT2 and reveals its function as a Na+- and Cl−-de pend ent neutral amino acid transporter. In contrast to its association with ACE2 observed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, our experiments with ace2 and collectrin null mice demonstrate that in vivo it is Collectrin, a smaller homologue of ACE2, that is required for functional expression of XT2 in kidney. To assess the function of XT2 in vivo, we reanalyzed its knock-out mouse model after more than 10 generations of backcrossing into C57BL/6 background. In addition to the previously published glycinuria, we observed a urinary loss of several other amino acids, in particular β-branched and small neutral ones. Using telemetry, we confirmed the previously described link of XT2 absence with hypertension but only in physically restrained animals. Taken together, our data indicate that the formerly orphan transporter XT2 functions as a sodium and chloride-de pend ent neutral amino acid transporter that we propose to rename B0AT3.

Taken together, our data indicate that the formerly orphan transporter XT2 functions as a sodium and chloride-de pend ent neutral amino acid transporter that we propose to rename B0AT3. The SLC6 family is composed of a variety of transporters that transfer small organic solutes, such as neurotransmitters and amino acids, across the plasma membrane. These substrates are co-transported with sodium and in many cases also with chloride. The substrates transported by most of the different family members have been identified and include neurotransmitters ((nor)epinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and γ-aminobutyric acid), osmolytes (taurine and creatinine), and amino acids. Despite this extensive characterization, no data directly demonstrating the function of XT2 (Slc6a18) in an expression system have been reported. In particular, the expression of XT2 in Xenopus laevis oocytes and cultured mammalian cells failed to result in uptake of a variety of tested substrates (1Nash S.R. Giros B. Kingsmore S.F.

However, XT2 exhibits ∼50% identity to B0AT1 (Slc6a19), the Na+ cotransporter of neutral amino acids the defect of which causes Hartnup disorder. The XT2 gene is arranged in tandem with that of B0AT1 (Slc6a19) on chromosome 5 in humans and chromosome 13 in mice and thus presumably arose by gene duplication. A cloning study identified, besides the A12 isoform that resembles most the other Slc6 family members, five shorter transcripts, the physiological significance of which is not established (1Nash S.R. Giros B. Kingsmore S.F. Kim K.M. el-Mestikawy S. Dong Q. Fumagalli F. Seldin M.F. Caron M.G. Receptors Channels. 1998; 6: 113-128PubMed Google Scholar). In a localization study performed using mouse tissues, we have shown that XT2 is mainly expressed in the kidney, where it localizes to the brush border membrane of the late proximal tubule (S2, S3) in a complementary fashion to B0AT1 that localizes to the early proximal tubule (S1) (3Romeo E.

A xt2 null mouse model was generated and analyzed previously (2Quan H. Athirakul K. Wetsel W.C. Torres G.E. Stevens R. Chen Y.T. Coffman T.M. Caron M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4166-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The high amounts of glycine found in the urine of these mice supported the hypothesis that the orphan gene product XT2 functions as an amino acid transporter. Measurements of uptake in brush border membrane vesicles additionally demonstrated its function as a high affinity transport system of glycine. Surprisingly, the xt2 null mice displayed a systolic blood pressure that was 15–20 mm Hg higher than that of their wild-type littermates, a difference that was abolished upon glycine supplementation in drinking water. Such an impact of XT2 on blood pressure was, however, not confirmed in humans, where a single-nucleotide polymorphism within the SLC6A18 gene present in 46.7% of a general Japanese population corresponds to a nonsense mutation (Y319X) presumably leading to a loss of function and is not associated with hypertension (4Eslami B. Kinboshi M. Inoue S. Harada K. Inoue K. Koizumi A. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 2006; 208: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that in the proximal kidney tubule, the expression of Slc6 B0 cluster amino acid transporters requires their association with Collectrin (Tmem27, Coll), a membrane protein homologous to the membrane anchor domain of the renin angiotensin system enzyme ACE2 (5Danilczyk U.

The first aim of the present study was therefore to retest the function of XT2 in the X. laevis expression system using co-expression of both the kidney and the small intestine-associated proteins Coll and ACE2 and, second, to retest the impact of the absence of XT2 in the xt2 null mouse model after backcrossing it more than 10 times into the C57BL/6 background. It appears, based on telemetric measurements, that XT2 is involved in blood pressure control only under stress conditions in the C57BL/6 background. We show in this study that the product of Slc6a18 called XT2 is a Na+- and Cl−-dependent neutral amino acid transporter and displays, compared with B0AT1, a lower K0.5 and a different substrate selectivity. Because of its broad transport selectivity for neutral amino acids, we suggest that it be renamed B0AT3. The constructs of the A12 isoform of mouse XT2-KSM, Collectrin-pcDNA3.1Hygro, and ACE2-pcDNA3 were linearized and used as template for RNA synthesis (mMESSAGE mMACHINE; Ambion, Austin, TX). Expression studies and uptake measurements in X. laevis oocytes were performed as described previously (7Ristic Z. Camargo S.M. Romeo E. Bodoy S. Bertran J. Palacin M. Makrides V. Furrer E.M. Verrey F. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F880-F887Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Ten-minute uptakes were performed with buffer containing 0.1 mm of the corresponding l-amino acid (2 μCi of 14C-l-amino acid/ml or 20 μCi of 3H-l-amino acid/ml). All experiments were done in buffer containing NaCl (100 mm) or NMDG-Cl (100 mm) for ion dependence experiments. Chloride was substituted by corresponding gluconate salts. Kinetics experiments were performed with increasing concentrations of l-Ile (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mm) or l-Gly (0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mm) in the presence of NaCl. Data are expressed in pmol/h/oocyte, and values obtained for non-injected oocytes are subtracted. Multiple comparisons within groups were performed by repeated measures one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey post test. The xt2, ace2, and collectrin wild-type and knock-out mice were housed in standard conditions and fed a standard diet. Generation of the knock-out mice was described elsewhere (2Quan H. Athirakul K.

All procedures for mice handling were according to the Swiss Animal Welfare laws and approved by the Kantonales Veterinäramt Zürich. Animals were adapted to metabolic cages (Tecniplast, Buguggiate, Italy) for 3 days before data collection, where they had free access to standard mouse diet (18.5% crude protein, Kliba-Nafag, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) and drinking water. After a first day of data collection in standard conditions, either the diet was switched to low protein (<0.5% crude protein; Kliba-Nafag) for 2 days, or water access was removed for 24 h. Daily food/water intake, urine/feces output, and body weights were measured. Urinary pH was measured using a pH microelectrode (691 pH-meter; Metrohm). Urinary creatinine was measured by the Jaffe method (9Seaton B. Ali A. Med. Lab. Sci. 1984; 41: 327-336PubMed Google Scholar). Urinary electrolytes (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl−, SO42−) were measured by ion chromatography (Metrohm ion chromatograph; Herisau, Switzerland). Mouse blood was collected by decapitation, and 1 μl of heparin-Na+ (25,000 international units/5 ml) (B. Braun (Melsungen, Germany)) was added. Plasma was collected after centrifugation at 5900 × g and 4 °C. Ice-cold methanol deproteinization of the plasma was performed as described elsewhere (10Suresh Babu S.V. Shareef M.M. Pavan Kumar Shetty A. Taranath Shetty K. Indian J. Clin. Biochem. 2002; 17: 7-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). One hundred microliters of deproteinized sample was dried and resuspended in 45 μl of borate buffer. Samples were then derivatized using AccQ Tag (Waters, Milford, MA) and analyzed on an Acquity UPLC (Waters) according to the manufacturer's instructions by the Functional Genomics Center Zurich (FGCZ) (11Cohen S.A. De Antonis K.M. J. Chromatogr. A. 1994; 661: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). One microliter of mouse urine collected over 24 h was diluted up to 100 μl by 50 mm HCl containing the internal standards norvaline and sarcosine in a concentration of 50 pmol/μl. The solutions were centrifuged and transferred into a new hydrolyzing tube. One microliter was injected for precolumn derivatization with ortho-phthaldialdehyde and analyzed on an Amino Quant amino acid analyzer (Agilent Technologies GmbH, Böblingen, Germany) at the Functional Genomics Center Zurich. RNA was extracted from frozen kidneys, and real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed as previously described (3Romeo E. Dave M.H. Bacic D. Ristic Z. Camargo S.M. Loffing J.

Three samples per mouse and genotype were run, and the abundance of the target mRNAs was calculated relative to hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a reference.

Digital images were viewed using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY) equipped with a DS-5 M Standard CCD camera (Nikon) and acquired with NIS-Elements (Nikon). Eight-week-old mice were anesthetized (see “Organ Fixation”) and implanted with a PA-C10 transmitter (Data Sciences International (DSI), St. Paul, MI) through the carotid artery as previously described and following manufacturer information to place the pressure-sensitive tip in the aortic arch (18Butz G.M.

For analgesia purposes, 100 μl of bupivacain hydrochloride 0.25% (Bucain, DeltaSelect GmbH, Pfullingen, Germany) was injected directly in the wound at the end of the procedure, and carprofenum (5 mg/kg; Rimadyl; Pfizer, New York) was injected subcutaneously every 12 h for 2 days. Twenty-four-hour continuous measurements were recorded after 2 weeks of recovery with Dataquest ART version 3.1 and RespiRate (DSI). Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure, heart frequency, activity, and respiratory rate were analyzed separately for the light versus dark phases and activity = 0 versus activity > 0. To mimic tail cuff manometry stress, mice were restrained for 20 min in a perforated 50-ml Falcon tube, when the data were continuously measured. Since XT2 has been shown to be associated in kidney proximal tubule with Coll (5Danilczyk U. Sarao R. Remy C. Benabbas C. Stange G. Richter A. Arya S. Pospisilik J.A. Singer D. Camargo S.M. Makrides V. Ramadan T. Verrey F. Wagner C.A. Penninger J.M. Nature. 2006; 444: 1088-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that XT2 would be expressed functionally in X. laevis oocytes in the presence of this associated protein. XT2 was therefore co-expressed in X. laevis oocytes with Coll and/or its homologue ACE2, and the uptake of l-isoleucine was tested. Unexpectedly, uptake of l-isoleucine was observed only when XT2 was co-expressed with ACE2, whereas no transport was observed when XT2 was expressed alone or together with Coll (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, co-expression of ACE2 and Coll with XT2 did not further increase the transport rate compared with XT2 plus ACE2. The l-isoleucine transport induction upon ACE2 co-expression is accompanied by a slight increase of XT2 surface expression of 1.64 ± 0.39-fold when compared with XT2 alone (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation of ACE2 from oocyte membranes using XT2 antibody shows that ACE2 interacts with XT2 (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that ACE2 acts as a chaperone for XT2, slightly increasing its surface expression and more strongly its function in X. laevis oocytes. This co-expression renders the measurement of XT2 transport function possible in an expression system for the first time. XT2 co-expression with ACE2 allowed the characterization of its transport selectivity, showing the transport of a broad range of neutral amino acids (Ala, Met, Val, Ile > Gly, Ser, Leu) (Fig. 2A). Concentration dependence experiments with l-Ile and Gly revealed a K0.5 of XT2 for these substrates (0.21 and 0.53 mm, respectively) that is lower than that of B0AT1 (Fig. 2, B and C) (20Camargo S.M. Makrides V. Virkki L.V. Forster I.C. Verrey F. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 451: 338-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast to B0AT1 but similarly to other members of the Slc6 family, such as the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter GAT1 (Slc6a1), the transport of l-Ile by XT2 is not only Na+- but also Cl−-dependent as well as pH-independent (Fig. 2, D and E). The Na+ dependence of Gly transport is sigmoidal, with a Hill coefficient that is higher than 1, suggesting that more than one sodium molecule is involved (data not shown). The precise ion transport stoichiometry of XT2 could not be investigated by two-electrode voltage clamp due to the low substrate transport rates. To verify and examine the role of XT2 as an amino acid transporter in more detail, we reanalyzed the xt2 null mouse model (2Quan H. Athirakul K. Wetsel W.C. Torres G.E. Stevens R. Chen Y.T. Coffman T.M. Caron M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4166-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) after more than 10 generations of backcrossing in C57BL/6 background. To evaluate whether the lack of XT2 induces compensatory changes, we examined the expression of the Slc6 family members B0AT1 and XT3 and of the associated proteins ACE2 and Coll at the mRNA and protein levels in xt2−/− mice but observed no difference with wild-type littermate controls (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). To evaluate the impact of the loss of XT2 on the whole animal, we monitored food and water intake as well as urine and feces output in metabolic cages, but there were no differences in the measured parameters between the xt2+/+ and xt2−/− mice (supplemental Table 1). Analysis of plasma amino acids only suggested a slight but statistically not significant decrease of glycine and l-arginine in the xt2−/− mice as compared with the xt2+/+ mice (Fig. 3A). A massive loss of glycine in the urine of the xt2−/− mice was confirmed, and the loss of other neutral amino acids, notably l-glutamine, was observed (Fig. 3B). To compare the reabsorption of amino acids, we estimated their fractional excretion. This is the proportion of the amino acids filtered by the kidney glomeruli that ends up in the urine (values of glomerular filtration rate were from Ref. 21Qi Z. Whitt I. Mehta A. Jin J. Zhao M. Harris R.C. Fogo A.B. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F590-F596Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Whereas the fractional excretion of l-glutamine was only slightly augmented to 2.94% in xt2 null mice, those of glycine and l-methionine were strongly elevated to 51.37 and 33.41%, respectively (Table 1). These results show that despite aminoaciduria, these mice do not exhibit any compensatory mechanisms, implying that the normal diet readily provides excessive amounts of amino acids. The urinary peak corresponding to l-arginine unfortunately could not be distinguished from that of taurine, preventing the evaluation of l-arginine loss in xt2 null mice. Challenging xt2 null animals with a low protein diet (<0.5% crude protein) did not induce any additional difference in the metabolic cage parameters measured between xt2 null and wild-type mice (supplemental Table 1).TABLE 1Fractional urinary amino acid excretionAmino acidFractionalaFractional excretion was calculated using an estimate of the glomerular filtration rate of 150 μl/min in females and 240 μl/min in males (21), the measured amino acid concentrations in plasma and urine, and the volume of urine excreted over 24 h. excretionxt2+/+bMales, n = 3; females, n = 3.xt2−/−Changeace2+/yFractional excretion was calculated using an estimate of the glomerular filtration rate of 150 μl/min in females and 240 μl/min in males (21), the measured amino acid concentrations in plasma and urine, and the volume of urine excreted over 24 h.cMales, n = 5.ace2−1yFractional excretion was calculated using an estimate of the glomerular filtration rate of 150 μl/min in females and 240 μl/min in males (21), the measured amino acid concentrations in plasma and urine, and the volume of urine excreted over 24 h.Changecoll+/yFractional excretion was calculated using an estimate of the glomerular filtration rate of 150 μl/min in females and 240 μl/min in males (21), the measured amino acid concentrations in plasma and urine, and the volume of urine excreted over 24 h.dMales, n = 3.coll−yChange%%-fold%%-fold%%-foldGly0.5351.3796.250.730.510.691.9582.1342.19Ala0.594.497.600.430.691.610.6056.4294.47Val0.333.5010.750.130.070.510.2126.36125.00Leu1.2311.719.500.450.250.561.5554.5635.22Ile2.308.973.900.390.150.370.4136.4588.31Met5.0033.416.681.611.190.746.2058.529.43Ser0.476.6614.072.481.770.721.9977.6939.00Thr1.047.337.060.570.350.611.55114.2473.78CysNDeND, not determined.NDNDNDNDNDNDNDNDPro0.330.591.791.711.130.660.4665.93144.59Asn2.916.762.33NDNDNDNDNDNDGln0.112.9426.720.320.321.000.3663.69177.61Phe0.395.8715.210.870.670.770.5221.2540.83Tyr0.342.146.380.610.490.801.7016.459.70Trp1.974.242.160.300.391.3010.9922.782.07Lys1.582.981.880.100.090.882.464.501.83ArgNDNDNDNDNDNDNDNDNDHis1.749.665.561.251.110.89NDNDNDAsp2.624.121.57NDNDNDNDNDNDGlu11.4616.031.404.053.610.892.176.523.01a Fractional excretion was calculated using an estimate of the glomerular filtration rate of 150 μl/min in females and 240 μl/min in males (21Qi Z.

Sequence analysis of the C-terminal polymerase region of pol gamma revealed a cluster of four Alpers mutations at highly conserved residues in the thumb subdomain (G848S, c.2542g-->a; T851A, c.2551a-->g; R852C, c.2554c-->t; R853Q, c.2558g-->a) and two Alpers mutations at less conserved positions in the adjacent palm subdomain (Q879H, c.2637g-->t and T885S, c.2653a-->t). Biochemical characterization of purified, recombinant forms of pol gamma revealed that Alpers mutations in the thumb subdomain reduced polymerase activity more than 99% relative to the wild-type enzyme, whereas the palm subdomain mutations retained 50-70% wild-type polymerase activity. All six mutant enzymes retained physical and functional interaction with the pol gamma accessory subunit (p55), and none of the six mutants exhibited defects in misinsertion fidelity in vitro. However, differential DNA binding by these mutants suggests a possible orientation of the DNA with respect to the polymerase during catalysis. To our knowledge this study represents the first structure-function analysis of the thumb subdomain in pol gamma and examines the consequences of mitochondrial disease mutations in this region."
https://openalex.org/W1997205555,"G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) deficiency has been linked recently to early Alzheimer disease (AD), but the mechanism by which GRK5 deficiency may contribute to AD pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we report that overexpression of dominant negative mutant of GRK5 (dnGRK5) in a cholinergic neuronal cell line led to decreased acetylcholine (ACh) release. This reduction was fully corrected by pertussis toxin, atropine (a nonselective muscarinic antagonist), or methoctramine (a selective M2/M4 muscarinic receptor antagonist). Consistent with results in cultured cells, high potassium-evoked ACh release in hippocampal slices from young GRK5 knock-out mice was significantly reduced compared with wild type littermates, and this reduced ACh release was also fully corrected by methoctramine. In addition, following treatment with the nonselective muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M, M2, and M4 receptors underwent significantly reduced internalization in GRK5KO slices compared with wild type slices, as assessed by plasma membrane retention of receptor immunoreactivity, whereas M1 receptor internalization was not affected by loss of GRK5 expression. Moreover, Western blotting revealed no synaptic or cholinergic degenerative changes in young GRK5 knock-out mice. Altogether, these results suggest that GRK5 deficiency leads to a reduced hippocampal ACh release and cholinergic hypofunction by selective impairment of desensitization of presynaptic M2/M4 autoreceptors. Because this nonstructural cholinergic hypofunction precedes the hippocampal cholinergic hypofunction associated with structural cholinergic degeneration and cognitive decline in aged GRK5 knock-out mice, this nonstructural alteration may be an early event contributing to cholinergic degeneration in AD. G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) deficiency has been linked recently to early Alzheimer disease (AD), but the mechanism by which GRK5 deficiency may contribute to AD pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we report that overexpression of dominant negative mutant of GRK5 (dnGRK5) in a cholinergic neuronal cell line led to decreased acetylcholine (ACh) release. This reduction was fully corrected by pertussis toxin, atropine (a nonselective muscarinic antagonist), or methoctramine (a selective M2/M4 muscarinic receptor antagonist). Consistent with results in cultured cells, high potassium-evoked ACh release in hippocampal slices from young GRK5 knock-out mice was significantly reduced compared with wild type littermates, and this reduced ACh release was also fully corrected by methoctramine. In addition, following treatment with the nonselective muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M, M2, and M4 receptors underwent significantly reduced internalization in GRK5KO slices compared with wild type slices, as assessed by plasma membrane retention of receptor immunoreactivity, whereas M1 receptor internalization was not affected by loss of GRK5 expression.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). We recently reported that increased soluble β-amyloid decreases membrane (functional) levels of GRK5 in vitro, and this membrane GRK5 deficiency occurs in vivo as well in an Alzheimer disease (AD) transgenic model (3.Suo Z. Wu M. Citron B.A. Wong G.T. Festoff B.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3444-3452Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and in postmortem human AD brain samples (4.Suo Z. Wu M. Citron B.A. Wong G.T. Festoff B.W. Neurobiol. Aging. 2005; 25: S2-291Google Scholar). Moreover, the aged GRK5 knock-out (GRK5KO) mouse, which models this GRK5 deficiency in the absence of exogenous mutant human β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) or any other known AD-related genes (i.e. presenilins or tau), develops axonal defects and mild cholinergic degeneration with associated amnestic mild cognitive impairment (5.Suo Z.

When Swedish mutant βAPP is overexpressed in the GRK5KO mice by cross-breeding with Swedish APP transgenic mice, the aged double mutant mice display significantly exaggerated brain inflammation (6.Li L. Liu J. Suo W.Z. J. Neuroinflammation. 2008; 5: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These accumulating data strongly suggest that GRK5 deficiency significantly contributes to AD pathogenesis, although the precise molecular mechanisms remain to be delineated.

Mounting evidence indicates that the substrate spectrum of broadly expressed GRKs (i.e. GRK2/3/5/6) can significantly overlap for some receptors, suggesting that a lack of one of these members may have only a limited impact on GPCR regulation (2.Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). On the other hand, compensation for loss of a particular GRK member by others in vivo can be incomplete or selective for other receptor types. For example, GRK2KO and GRK6KO mice have been shown to display selective impairments of adrenergic and dopaminergic receptor desensitization, respectively (7.Jaber M. Koch W.J. Rockman H. Smith B. Bond R.A. Sulik K.K. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 12974-12979Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 8.Gainetdinov R.R. Bohn L.M.

Findings from different GRK isoform-targeted animals strongly support the conclusion that although redundancy exists between GRK isoforms, each isoform has its own selective substrates; should one GRK be deficient or inactivated, desensitization of its selective substrates will be impaired (1.Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). For GRK5 in particular, previous studies have demonstrated that GRK5KO mice display selectively impaired desensitization of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) (9.Gainetdinov R.R. Bohn L.M.

To date, five mAChR subtypes have been identified, with M1, M3, and M5 receptors being Gq/11-coupled, and M2 and M4 receptors being Gi/o-coupled (11.Matsui M. Yamada S. Oki T. Manabe T. Taketo M.M. Ehlert F.J. Life Sci. 2004; 75: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In hippocampal memory circuits, M2 receptor (M2R) is primarily a presynaptic autoreceptor that inhibits ACh release (12.Levey A.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13541-13546Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 13.Zhang W. Basile A.S. Gomeza J. Volpicelli L.A. Levey A.I. Wess J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1709-1717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas M1R is postsynaptic and is believed to be critical in memory processes involving an interaction between the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (11.Matsui M. Yamada S. Oki T. Manabe T. Taketo M.M. Ehlert F.J. Life Sci. 2004; 75: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In AD, there is a selective loss of cholinergic neurons that leads to a cholinergic hypofunction, primarily a hypoactivity of postsynaptic nicotinic and M1 muscarinic receptors (14.Terry Jr., A.V. Buccafusco J.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). GRK5KO mice, when challenged with nonselective muscarinic agonists, display augmented hypothermia, hypoactivity, tremor, and salivation, as well as antinociceptive changes (9.Gainetdinov R.R. Bohn L.M. Walker J.K. Laporte S.A. Macrae A.D. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Premont R.T. Neuron. 1999; 24: 1029-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These behavioral changes are typical M2 and/or M4 receptor-mediated functions, according to the findings from muscarinic receptor subtype knock-out mice (11.Matsui M. Yamada S. Oki T. Manabe T. Taketo M.M. Ehlert F.J. Life Sci. 2004; 75: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15.Wess J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 423-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Therefore, GRK5 deficiency in vivo may selectively impair M2/M4R desensitization. If so, the resulting presynaptic M2/M4R hyperactivity would overly inhibit ACh release from cholinergic neurons and eventually compromise the learning and memory function. This study was undertaken to investigate the impact of GRK5 deficiency on ACh release and desensitization of mAChR subtypes using GRK5-deficient models both in vitro and in hippocampal slices from the GRK5KO mice. [Methyl-3H]Choline chloride was from Amersham Biosciences. Fetal bovine serum was from Atlanta Biologicals (Norcross, GA). Pertussis toxin (PTX), methoctramine tetrahydrochloride (MT), atropine, Eserine, and oxotremorine-M (oxo-M) were purchased from Sigma. Other routine biochemical and cell culture reagents and supplies were purchased from Sigma, Invitrogen, or Fisher. The coding sequence of K215R dominant negative (dn) mutant bovine GRK5 cDNA in the previously constructed pRK5-GRK5K215R plasmid (16.Pitcher J.A. Fredericks Z.L. Stone W.C. Premont R.T. Stoffel R.H. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24907-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was initially used as a template for PCR with T7 primer and a modified GRK5 reverse primer (5′-AAATTTGTCGACGCTGCTTCCGGTGGAGTT-3′) that eliminated the stop codon of the GRK5 and added SalI site. The resultant PCR product containing the dnGRK5 and phrGFP-C mammalian expression vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were digested with BamHI/SalI and then ligated to generate dnGRK5GFP fusion construct, with the humanized Renilla green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) tagged at C-terminal of the dnGRK5. The point mutation of the dnGRK5GFP was then corrected by mutagenesis to generate the wild type (wt) GRK5GFP fusion construction. The full length of both the dnGRK5GFP and wtGRK5GFP fusions was sequenced to exclude any unexpected mutations. Because of very low levels of intrinsic M2R expression in the HT22 cells, this study used pVITRO1 multigenic expression vector (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) to coexpress the GRK5GFP along with M2 together. The pVITRO1 carries two elongation factor 1α promoters from rat and mouse origins (rEF1α and mEF1α). Similarly to their human counterpart, both promoters display strong activities that yield similar levels of expression. The hph gene confers resistance to hygromycin B in both Escherichia coli and mammalian cells. Therefore, pVITRO1 plasmids allow ubiquitous and constitutive coexpression of two genes of interest at high levels in mammalian cells. For the constructs, human M2R cDNA (University of Missouri-Rolla cDNA Resource Center) was first digested with AgeI/BglII and inserted into multiple cloning site (MCS) 2 of pVITRO1. Then the wtGRK5GFP and dnGRK5GFP fusions from the phrGFP-C vector were digested with BsiWI/AvrII and inserted into the MCS 1 of pVITRO1 (see Fig. 1A). For the hrGFP control, the phrGFP-C was digested with BamHI/AvrII and inserted into the MCS 1 of pVITRO1. The full length of all the inserts was sequence-confirmed before transfection. HT22 cells are a generous gift from Dr. David Schubert (The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) (17.Li Y. Maher P. Schubert D. Neuron. 1997; 19: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 18.Li Y. Maher P. Schubert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 7748-7753Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin, as previously described (19.Suo Z. Wu M. Citron B.A. Palazzo R.E. Festoff B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37681-37689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed using 0.125–0.25 μg of plasmid DNA (pVITRO1-dnGRK5GFP/M2, pVITRO1-wtGRK5GFP/M2, and pVITRO1-GFP/M2) mixed with TransFastTM reagents (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Forty-eight hours after transfection, hygromycin B (750 μg/ml) was added to the medium for initial selection of stably transfected cells. Two weeks after initial selection, the transfected cells were diluted and further purified with assistance of cloning cylinders (Bellco Glass, Inc., Vineland, NJ). The cloned stable lines were maintained in the culture medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin B to keep the selection pressure. Selected lines of HT22/dnGRK5GFP/M2, HT22/wtGRK5GFP/M2, and HT22/GFP/M2 that express equivalent numbers of the transgene copies were used for this study. For all functional assays, the HT22 cells were differentiated, as previously described (19.Suo Z. Wu M. Citron B.A. Palazzo R.E. Festoff B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37681-37689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), before any treatments were applied. The mRNA levels of cells were analyzed by RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from the hrGFP, wtGRK5, and dnGRK5 transfected HT22 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and then quantified by UV spectrophotometry (Bio-Rad). Total RNA (2 μg) was used to create cDNA using SuperScriptTM II first strand synthesis system kit (Invitrogen). Subsequent PCR amplification of murine GRK5, bovine GRK5GFP fusion, or GAPDH (an internal control) was carried out for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 40 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s, followed by a 5-min final extension at 72 °C. The PCR products were run on 1.8% agarose gels, and the intensities were measured using an image analyzer Quantity one (Bio-Rad).

Open table in a new tab This experiment was performed in both cultured cells and perfused hippocampal slices. HT22 cells seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates were allowed for differentiation, as previously described (19.Suo Z. Wu M. Citron B.A. Palazzo R.E. Festoff B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37681-37689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated with medium containing [methyl-3H]choline chloride at a final concentration of 0.05 μm (5 μCi/ml) for 2 h. This low concentration of [3H]choline favors the selective uptake of choline through high affinity choline transporter (HACT) (20.Pittel Z. Heldman E. Rubinstein R. Cohen S. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After the incubation, the cells were rinsed three times, followed by high potassium (50 mm) stimulation in the presence of 1 μm Eserine (to prevent hydrolysis of the released ACh (21.Gifford A.N. Bruneus M. Gatley S.J. Lan R. Makriyannis A. Volkow N.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 478-483PubMed Google Scholar)) for 2 h, with normal potassium medium containing 1 μm Eserine as control for determination of basal release. The conditioned medium (200 μl/sample) was then taken for liquid scintillation counting. As previously demonstrated, the total released radioactivity in similar conditions contains more than 90% authentic [3H]ACh (13.Zhang W. Basile A.S. Gomeza J. Volpicelli L.A. Levey A.I. Wess J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1709-1717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Liu J. Li L. Suo W.Z. Life Sci. 2009; 84: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Therefore, the total secreted [3H] beyond (subtracting) the basal release was used to represent the [3H]ACh release in response to a treatment. For determining the impact of PTX, the differentiated cells were incubated with the medium in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml PTX overnight before high potassium stimulation. All other treatments, such as muscarinic antagonists, were given simultaneously with the high potassium stimulation. For the perfused brain slices, hippocampi from 3-month-old GRK5+/+ and GRK5−/− mice were dissected and chopped into 300-μm slices with a McIIwain tissue chopper. After brief rinsing with cold saline, the hippocampal slices were transferred to normal potassium Hepes buffer (10.7 mm glucose, 121 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm Hepes, 1.87 mm KCl, 1.22 mm CaCl2, 1.17 mm KH2PO4, 1.17 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4) at 37 °C, continuously gassed with 95% O2:5%CO2, and incubated for 45 min with buffer changing every 15 min. The [3H]choline incorporation was then performed by incubation of the slices at 37 °C for 20 min in the Hepes buffer containing 0.1 μm [methyl-3H]choline chloride (10 μCi/ml). Following washing with the oxygenated Hepes buffer without [3H]choline, the slices were transferred to superfusion chambers and perfused (0.5 ml/min) with the oxygenated Hepes buffer without [3H]choline at 37 °C for 1 h. For the purpose of predesensitizing the muscarinic receptors, one set of the slices was perfused with a saturated carbachol (1 mm) for 20 min, followed by a 20-min washing off perfusion with the oxygenated Hepes buffer. For high potassium stimulation, the isosmotic Hepes buffer containing 24 mm potassium was used. In addition, 1 μm Eserine was used along with all treatments, including normal control, high potassium, and M2 antagonist treatments, to prevent hydrolysis of the released ACh (21.Gifford A.N. Bruneus M. Gatley S.J. Lan R. Makriyannis A. Volkow N.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 478-483PubMed Google Scholar). Perfusion samples were collected every 2 min, with three fractions before treatment for base line and six fractions after treatment. At the end of the sample collection, the hippocampal slices were lysed, with an aliquot for protein quantification and the rest for remaining radioactivity determination. The radioactivity for all of the samples was determined by scintillation counting. For cultured HT22 cells, the membrane and cytosol fractions were prepared as previously described (23.Li L. Rasul I. Liu J. Zhao B. Tang R. Premont R.T. Suo W.Z. Brain Res. Bull. 2009; 78: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were dissociated mechanically in TnT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.6) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Following centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 90 min, the supernatant was collected as the cytosol fraction. The pellet was resuspended in TnT-SDS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 4 mm EDTA, 4% SDS, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 90 min, the supernatant was collected as the membrane fraction. The preparation of brain membrane fractions was performed according to a protocol previously described (24.Rogers S.W. Hughes T.E. Hollmann M. Gasic G.P. Deneris E.S. Heinemann S. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2713-2724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. In brief, the brain slices were homogenized in 9× volume of prechilled homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 10% sucrose, 5 mm EDTA containing a freshly added protease inhibitor cocktails of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml benzamidine, and 20 μg/ml iodoacetamide), followed by centrifugation at 600 × g, 4 °C for 5 min to collect the P1 pellet (nuclear fraction). The supernatant was centrifuged at 16,000 × g, 4 °C for 30 min to collect the P2 pellet (mitochondria/microsome fraction). The P2 pellet was resuspended with 9× volumes of ice-cold 320 mm sucrose, followed by centrifugation at 9200 × g, 4 °C for 15 min to collect the P3 pellet (crude membrane/synaptosomes fraction). The pellets were then lysed with boiling denaturing lysate buffer (1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4), supplemented with phosphatase (BioMol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and protease inhibitor mixtures (Roche Applied Science) for routine preparation of Western blot. For the cells, differentiated or otherwise stated separately, cells at ∼70% confluence were lysed with the boiling denaturing lysate buffer. For the mice, at euthanasia, cold phosphate-buffered saline-perfused brains were dissected to obtain hippocampus. Except for the cellular fraction preparation, which is described above, all other protein extract preparation, total protein content determination, Western blotting, and semi-quantitative analyses were performed as previously described (5.Suo Z.

The only exception was the dilution rates for the different primary antibodies, which include synaptophysin (Sigma; 1:400), synapsin-IIa (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA; 1:5,000), synaptotagmin (BD Biosciences; 1:1,000), SNAP-25 (BD Biosciences; 1:1,000), neuronal growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43; Sigma; 1:500), M1 and M4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; 1:200), M2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:100), acetylcholine esterase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:500), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; Chemicon, Temecula, CA; 1:800), HACT (Chemicon; 1:4,000), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:200), hrGFP (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA; 1:5,000), and β-actin (Sigma; 1:2,500). The cells seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated round cover-slips at a density of 1 × 104/well were fixed with prechilled (4 °C) 5% acetic acid in methanol for 45 min at 4 °C, followed by washing blocking and staining with specific antibodies, as previously described (25.Suo Z.

Quantitative data are expressed as the means ± S.E. and analyzed by analysis of variance using SPSS 11.0. Post-hoc comparisons of means were made using Scheffe's or Tukey's method where appropriate. HT22 cells are immortalized murine hippocampal neuronal precursor cells. We have recently found that the differentiated HT22 neurons possess functional cholinergic neuronal properties (22.Liu J. Li L. Suo W.Z. Life Sci. 2009; 84: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To investigate impact of GRK5 deficiency on desensitization of muscarinic receptors, we established an in vitro model in HT22 cells by stable transfection of K215R mutant dnGRK5. Overexpression of the dnGRK5 has been previously used to inhibit endogenous GRK5 so as to resemble GRK5 deficiency in vitro (16.Pitcher J.A. Fredericks Z.L. Stone W.C. Premont R.T. Stoffel R.H. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24907-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” because of very low intrinsic M2R expression in HT22 cells, we inserted human M2R cDNA into the MCS2 of pVITRO1 vector and then inserted bovine dnGRK5 cDNA tagged on its C-terminal with GFP into MSC1 of the multigenic expression vector (Fig. 1A). In parallel, the wtGRK5GFP or GFP alone were inserted to the MSC1 of pVITRO1 and were used as controls. After transfection, selected stable lines expressing GFP/M2, dnGRK5GFP/M2, and wtGRK5GFP/M2 (for easier description, these cell lines will be abbreviated as GFP, dnGRK5, and wtGRK5, respectively) were examined using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, Western blots, and ICC. The RT-PCR result revealed that the mRNA levels of exogenous bovine dnGRK5 and wtGRK5 were similar, whereas the intrinsic murine GRK5 mRNA level in the dnGRK5 transfected cells was 24% higher than that in the wtGRK5 transfected cells. As a result, the expression levels of dnGRK5 and wtGRK5 were ∼3.3- and 4.1-fold higher, respectively, than intrinsic murine GRK5 level in their corresponding cell lines (Fig. 1B). Western blot data confirmed that the exogenous dnGRK5GFP and wtGRK5GFP, as well as M2R, were expressed in similar levels in their corresponding cell lines. Meanwhile, expression of other intrinsic cholinergic markers of interest, such as ChAT, HACT, M1R, and M4R, were also found to be similar among the three cell lines (Fig. 1C). Microscopic observation further confirmed the primary cell membrane localization of both dnGRK5GFP and wtGRK5GFP fusion proteins, where GRK5 primarily localizes (1.Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), which is in contrast to the cytosolic localization of the GFP (Fig. 2, A, D, and G). In addition, ICC with an antibody against M2R revealed a distribution of particle-like M2R immunoreactivity from the perinuclear region all the way to the axon terminals (Fig. 2, B, E, and H), which is consistent with the known cytosolic synthesis and nerve terminal distribution of M2R because of axonal transport (27.Guidry G. Willison B.D. Blakely R.D. Landis S.C. Habecker B.A. Auton Neurosci. 2005; 123: 54-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 28.Amadeo A. Arcelli P. Spreafico R. De Biasi S. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 184: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In particular, at axonal terminals, the M2R immunoreactivity was found to be colocalized with dnGRK5GFP or wtGRK5GFP (Fig. 2, C, F, and I). These results suggest that although the GFP, dnGRK5, and wtGRK5 cell lines have different (normal, decreased, and increased, respectively) GRK5 functional status, their cholinergic properties are comparable and therefore are appropriate in vitro models for studying impact of GRK5 hypofunction on muscarinic neurotransmission. After the in vitro models were established, we examined high K+-evoked ACh release from these cell lines. We found that dnGRK5 and wtGRK5 had opposite effects on [3H]ACh release (Fig. 3A), with the former significantly decreased (p < 0.05) and the latter significantly increased (p < 0.05) compared with the GFP control cells. When these cells were pretreated with a Gi-protein activation inhibitor, PTX (100 ng/ml), all three cell lines showed severalfold increase in ACh release (Fig. 3B, p < 0.001 for all three as compared with their corresponding vehicles), but the absolute differences among the three cell lines disappeared. In addition to PTX, treatment with a nonselective muscarinic antagonist, atropine (1 μm), and a selective M2/M4R antagonist, methoctramine (MT, 100 nm), each resulted in significantly increased ACh release and also eliminated the differences among the three cell lines (Fig. 3, C and D). These results suggest that the functional difference of GRK5 in these three cell lines leads to altered ACh release, which is mediated by an altered function of PTX-sensitive G protein-coupled muscarinic M2 and/or M4 receptors. To determine the impact of GRK5 function on internalization of mAChRs, we exposed the cells to a saturating concentration of oxo-M (a nonselectiv"

Mutations in TIMP-3 cause Sorsby Fundus Dystrophy, a dominant inherited, early onset macular degenerative disease, with choroidal neovascularization causing a loss of vision in the majority of patients. Here we report that expression of S156C TIMP-3 mutation in endothelial cells results in an abnormal localization of the protein, increased glycosylation, decreased matrix metalloproteinase inhibitory activity, and increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binding with a consequent increase in VEGF-dependent migration and tube formation. These enhanced signaling events appear to be mediated as a consequence of a post-transcriptionally regulated increase in the expression of membrane-associated VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells of Timp-3(156/156) mutant mice as well as in human Sorsby fundus dystrophy eyes. Understanding the mechanism(s) by which mutant TIMP-3 can induce abnormal neovascularization provides important insight into the pathophysiology of a number of diseases with increased angiogenesis."

In an effort to better characterize ligand binding in drug resistance, we have previously engineered hDHFR variant F31R/Q35E. This variant displays a >650-fold decrease in methotrexate affinity, while maintaining catalytic activity comparable to the native enzyme. To elucidate the molecular basis of decreased methotrexate affinity in the doubly substituted variant, we determined kinetic and inhibitory parameters for the simple variants F31R and Q35E. This demonstrated that the important decrease of methotrexate affinity in variant F31R/Q35E is a result of synergistic effects of the combined substitutions. To better understand the structural cause of this synergy, we obtained the crystal structure of hDHFR variant F31R/Q35E complexed with methotrexate at 1.7-Å resolution. The mutated residue Arg-31 was observed in multiple conformers. In addition, seven native active-site residues were observed in more than one conformation, which is not characteristic of the wild-type enzyme. This suggests that increased residue disorder underlies the observed methotrexate resistance. We observe a considerable loss of van der Waals and polar contacts with the p-aminobenzoic acid and glutamate moieties. The multiple conformers of Arg-31 further suggest that the amino acid substitutions may decrease the isomerization step required for tight binding of methotrexate.

As a consequence of its essential role in nucleoside biosynthesis, hDHFR has been extensively exploited as a drug target. Inhibition with folate antagonists, or antifolates, arrests cell proliferation. The most effective clinical antifolate to date is methotrexate (MTX (Fig. 1)), a slow, tight-binding competitive inhibitor that displays high affinity for hDHFR (KiMTX = 3.4 pm). MTX is currently used to treat a variety of diseases, including cancer (1Slamon D.J. Romond E.H. Perez E.A. Clin. Adv. Hematol. Oncol. 2006; 4: 4-9Google Scholar, 2Daw N.C. Billups C.A.

Dis. Child. 2003; 88: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A number of resistance mechanisms to MTX have been observed in cancer patients, including impaired transport of MTX to the cytoplasm (5Flintoff W.F. Sadlish H. Gorlick R. Yang R. Williams F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1690: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and decreased retention of MTX in the cell (6Takemura Y. Kobayashi H. Miyachi H. Anticancer Drugs. 1999; 10: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Numerous ex vivo studies have reported mutations in the hDHFR gene resulting in an enzyme variant with decreased affinity for MTX (7Blakley R.L. Sorrentino B.P. Hum.

These have contributed to increase our understanding of the molecular basis for active-site discrimination between the substrate, DHF, and its competitive inhibitor, MTX. Understanding the molecular interactions that affect tight binding of MTX to the active site of DHFR will contribute to our understanding of antifolate binding to DHFR, which can in turn contribute to the design of more efficient inhibitors. human dihydrofolate reductase 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid dihydrofolate methotrexate N-[4-[(2,4-diaminofuro[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)methyl]methylamino]benzoyl]-l-glutamate p-aminobenzoic acid. human dihydrofolate reductase 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid dihydrofolate methotrexate N-[4-[(2,4-diaminofuro[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)methyl]methylamino]benzoyl]-l-glutamate p-aminobenzoic acid.

Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because MTX and DHF bind to the active site of hDHFR in a similar manner, all known substitutions causing a decrease in MTX affinity also decrease DHF affinity and overall catalytic efficiency (7Blakley R.L. Sorrentino B.P. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Fossati E. Volpato J.P. Poulin L. Guerrero V. Dugas D.A. Pelletier J.N. J. Biomol.

However, the loss of DHF affinity and catalytic efficiency is generally smaller than the loss of MTX affinity. This is often attributed to formation of different contacts with either ligand due to the 180° inversion of the pterin ring of bound DHF relative to MTX (17Cody V. Luft J.R. Pangborn W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19Oefner C. D'Arcy A. Winkler F.K. Eur. J.

Anticancer Drug Des. 1998; 13: 307-315PubMed Google Scholar), complexed to various antifolates, have been reported. Only the L22Y variant has been co-crystallized with MTX. Despite its decreased affinity for MTX (L22Y KiMTX = 11 nm versus WT KiMTX < 31 pm (18Volpato J.P. Fossati E. Pelletier J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)), the inhibitor in the variant structure was bound in the same way as in the native enzyme, making interpretation of decreased affinity difficult to assess. Nonetheless, the low probability conformation of residue Tyr-22 suggested that the presence of a bulky aromatic residue in this area of the folate-binding pocket generated unfavorable hydrophobic interactions with the 2,4-diaminopterin moiety of the inhibitor (12Lewis W.S. Cody V. Galitsky N. Luft J.R. Pangborn W. Chunduru S.K. Spencer H.T. Appleman J.R. Blakley R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5057-5064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This is also expected to reduce DHF substrate binding. Structures of MTX-resistant variants F31G and F31S were obtained complexed to N-[4-[(2,4-diaminofuro[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)methyl]methylamino]benzoyl]-l-glutamate (MTXO) (25Cody V. Galitsky N. Luft J.R. Pangborn W. Blakley R.L. Gangjee A. Anticancer Drug Des. 1998; 13: 307-315PubMed Google Scholar), a MTX analog in which the 2,4–2,4-diaminopterin moiety is replaced by a 2,4-diaminofuropyrimidine moiety. Superposition of MTXO-bound variants with MTX-bound WT hDHFR revealed that the ligands bind to the active site in an analogous manner. It was suggested that decreased MTX binding in the substituted variants resulted from the loss of van der Waals and hydrophobic contacts established between the native Phe-31 and the p-ABA and 2,4-diaminopterin moieties of MTX. F31G and F31S display a 10-fold decrease in affinity for MTX relative to WT hDHFR (KiMTX < 31 pm (18Volpato J.P. Fossati E. Pelletier J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)). Further Phe-31 variants (i.e. F31R; KiMTX = 7 nm, 200-fold decrease in MTX affinity) (10Patel M. Sleep S.E. Lewis W.S. Spencer H.T. Mareya S.M. Sorrentino B.P. Blakley R.L. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 2069-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) display larger decreases in affinity relative to F31G and F31S. This cannot be rationalized by reduction of side-chain contacts with the inhibitor due to the presence of a smaller side chain. These results illustrate the difficulty of gaining insight into the molecular causes for altered MTX binding. This may be partly attributed to the very tight binding of MTX to the native enzyme, such that binding to resistant variants often remains in the sub-nanomolar or low nanomolar range, where the general mode of ligand binding has not changed appreciably relative to the native enzyme. Combining active-site mutations in hDHFR by protein engineering has been shown to generate variants with greatly decreased affinity to MTX (18Volpato J.P. Fossati E. Pelletier J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Ercikan-Abali E.A. Mineishi S. Tong Y. Nakahara S. Waltham M.C. Banerjee D. Chen W. Sadelain M. Bertino J.R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4142-4145PubMed Google Scholar). Studying the molecular interactions in highly MTX-resistant hDHFR variants offers the possibility of capturing more important changes in enzyme-ligand interactions. Here, we report detailed observations for the mode of MTX resistance in the combinatorial variant F31R/Q35E. Variant F31R/Q35E is a relevant candidate for better understanding the specific interactions that govern ligand recognition in the folate binding site, because it displays a >650-fold decrease in MTX affinity (KiMTX = 21 nm) accompanied by a modest, 9-fold decrease of affinity for the substrate DHF relative to WT hDHFR (18Volpato J.P. Fossati E. Pelletier J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently shown that this variant is an efficient selectable marker for various mammalian cell types, including murine hematopoietic stem cells (18Volpato J.P. Fossati E. Pelletier J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 7J. P. Volpato, N. Mayotte, G. Sauvageau, and J. N. Pelletier, submitted for publication. 7J. P. Volpato, N. Mayotte, G. Sauvageau, and J. N. Pelletier, submitted for publication. Because mutations giving rise to MTX resistance are not observed in mammals, and because MTX is approved for human treatment, engineered resistant DHFRs offer great potential as human selective markers ex vivo or in vivo (10Patel M. Sleep S.E. Lewis W.S. Spencer H.T. Mareya S.M. Sorrentino B.P. Blakley R.L. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 2069-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Allay J.A. Persons D.A. Galipeau J.

Moore M.A. Blood. 1995; 85: 566-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand the effect of either amino acid substitution on each ligand, a kinetic double mutant cycle was constructed with the simple variants F31R and Q35E. The crystal structure of the F31R/Q35E variant was obtained with bound MTX at 1.7-Å resolution, to elucidate the structural basis of MTX resistance in this variant. In addition, molecular docking was performed with the F31R/Q35E structure to evaluate the role of the two substitutions toward folate binding. Overall, the results reveal synergistic effects of the combined substitutions toward loss of MTX binding, characterized by increased disorder of specific residues throughout the active site of the highly MTX-resistant F31R/Q35E variant. The hDHFR F31R/Q35E gene was amplified by PCR using the following primer set: forward (5′-CACACACCATATGGTTGGTTCGCTAAACTG-3′, NdeI restriction site in italics) and reverse (5′-GTTCTGAGGTCATTACTGG-3′, external primer) from the hDHFR F31R/Q35E-pQE32 template (18Volpato J.P. Fossati E. Pelletier J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The amplified gene was subcloned in the modified pET24 vector (29Doucet N. Savard P.Y.

The expected sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The F31R and Q35E substitutions were created by megaprimer PCR using external primer set 2 described in a previous study (18Volpato J.P. Fossati E. Pelletier J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and the mutagenic primers 5′-TCTCTGGAAATATCTACGTTCGTTCCTTAAGG (F31R, reverse) and 5′-GTTGTGGTCATTTCTTTCGAAATATCTAAATTCGT (Q35E, reverse), respectively. The amplified gene was subcloned in the pQE32 vector between the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites using T4 DNA ligase, and the ligation mixture was transformed into electrocompetent SK037 cells (18Volpato J.P. Fossati E. Pelletier J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Expression, purification, and determination of kinetic and inhibitory constants was performed as previously described (18Volpato J.P. Fossati E. Pelletier J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, kinetic and inhibition assays were conducted in MATS buffer (25 mm MES, 25 mm acetate, 50 mm Tris, 100 mm sodium acetate, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide) (pH 7.6) at 23 °C, by monitoring the NADPH and DHF depletion (Δϵ340 nm = 12 800 m−1 cm−1). All assays were performed in at least four independent experiments, and the average values are reported. The initial rates during the first 15% of substrate conversion were recorded for all assays. Kinetic and inhibition parameters were obtained from a non-linear regression fit to the Henri Michaelis-Menten equation using Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The kcat values were determined in the presence of saturating substrate concentrations (100 μm each of DHF and NADPH) in 1-cm cells according to kcat = Vmax/[E]. KmDHF values were obtained using 10-cm cells containing 1 nm enzyme, 10 μm NADPH and a range of DHF concentrations (0.05 μm to 10 μm). IC50MTX was determined in the presence of saturating substrate concentrations and variable MTX concentrations (0.025 μm to 100 μm). Inhibition constants for MTX (KiMTX) were calculated from IC50MTX according to the equation for competitive inhibitor binding (30Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. Wiley Classics Library Ed John Wiley and Sons, New York1993: 100-120Google Scholar). An overnight culture of BL21(DE3)/hDHFR F31R/Q35E-pET24 was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium. The culture was grown at 37 °C until the A600 nm reached ≈0.7. Protein expression was induced with the addition of 1 mm of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, after which the cells were grown for 16 h at 22 °C. Induced cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, at 4 °C. The cells were lysed on ice using a Branson sonicator (four pulses at 200 watts for 30 s with a tapered micro-tip). The cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation (4000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter before purification. Purification was performed following a two-step purification protocol on an AKTA fast-protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) at 5 °C. First, the supernatant was applied to an anion-exchange DEAE-Sepharose column (1.6 × 30 cm) followed by a 3-column volume wash with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, at 2 ml/min. A linear gradient of 5 column volumes with NaCl (0–200 mm) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, was used to elute the F31R/Q35E variant. hDHFR activity was monitored in MATS buffer, pH 7.6, in the presence of 100 μm each of NADPH and DHF. Activity was measured in flat-bottom plates (Costar #3595) by monitoring concurrent depletion of NADPH and DHF (Δϵ340 nm = 12 800 m−1 cm−1) on a FLUOstar OPTIMA UV-visible plate reader (BMG Laboratories, Offenburg, Germany). Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Following dialysis, the sample (45 ml) was concentrated to 1.5 ml using an Amicon concentrator (molecular weight cut-off 10000, Millipore), for injection on a Superose 12 column (1.6 × 55 cm). The sample was eluted with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. hDHFR activity was monitored as described above. Enzyme purity was evaluated using separation by SDS-PAGE (15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel) stained by the zinc-imidazole method (31Fernandez-Patron C. Castellanos-Serra L. Rodriguez P. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 564-573PubMed Google Scholar) and quantified using the public domain image analysis software Scion Image (NIH, rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). Protein concentration was quantified using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Purified hDHFR F31R/Q35E enzyme was concentrated to 10 mg/ml using an Amicon concentrator (molecular weight cut-off 10000). MTX and NADPH were prepared as described previously (18Volpato J.P. Fossati E. Pelletier J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and were added at a final concentration of 2 mm each (5-fold molar excess) to the protein sample. Crystallization experiments were set up using hanging drop, vapor-diffusion experiments, with a reservoir volume of 1 ml and a drop size of 4 μl of equal volumes of protein and reservoir solutions. A reservoir solution containing 0.2 m cadmium phosphate and 2.2 m ammonium sulfate yielded crystal-like formations that diffracted poorly. These crystals were crushed using a Hampton Seed Bead Kit and used as seeds (1/10 dilution). Rod-shaped crystals were obtained from crystallization experiments with 0.2 m sodium phosphate and 2.2 m ammonium sulfate as the reservoir solution and with drops containing 1.5 μl of protein, 2 μl of reservoir solution, and 0.5 μl of seeding solution. The crystals were soaked in the mother liquor supplemented with 15% glycerol as a cryoprotectant and frozen in a nitrogen cryostream (model X-stream 2000). Data were collected using a Rigaku RU-H3R generator, equipped with Osmic focusing mirrors, and an R-axis IV++ image plate detector, and processed using HKL-2000 (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab The structure was determined by molecular replacement using Phaser (33Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar), which found a single protein molecule in the asymmetric unit (Resolution Range Used: 1.70–25.99; Log Likelihood Gain (refined): 726.123). A lower quality His-tagged F31R/Q35E-MTX-NADPH structure (see supplemental materials) was used as a molecular replacement model. Reciprocal-space refinement was performed using Refmac (34Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13811) Google Scholar) and included individual isotropic B-factor refinement as well as TLS refinement in the final stages of refinement. Manual model building was performed periodically using Coot (35Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22994) Google Scholar) (Table 1). The ligands were prepared as pdb files using ChemDraw 8.0 and Chem3D 8.0 (CambridgeSoft, Cambridge, MA). Energy minimization of ligands was performed with the integrated MM2 energy minimization script in Chem3D. Automated docking experiments were performed using the Autodock 4 software package (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Macromolecules PDB ID 1U72 and 3EIG were stripped of all ligands and heteroatoms, with the exception of the highly conserved active site water molecule (H2O #216 in 1U72, H2O #244 in 3EIG), and were prepared using default settings. A box covering the entire folate binding site and more than half the NADPH binding site was generated as a docking grid. 50 runs of a Lamarckian genetic algorithm using default settings were performed. Following docking, clusters were evaluated according to total binding energies calculated by Autodock 4, and the minimal energy conformation within the lowest energy cluster was retained for comparison with crystal structures. To determine the effect of each constituent amino acid substitution of the F31R/Q35E variant on DHF and MTX binding, the singly-substituted F31R and Q35E were created and their kinetic and inhibition parameters were determined (Table 2). The reactivity (kcat) of F31R and Q35E are 5-fold lower (1.9 ± 0.3 s−1) and 2-fold lower (4.6 ± 0.2 s−1) than WT hDHFR, respectively. The kcat of F31R/Q35E is similar to that of the F31R variant, indicating that loss of reactivity in F31R/Q35E is primarily due to the F31R substitution. The Michaelis constants (KmDHF) of variants F31R and Q35E are 110 ± 60 and 250 ± 90 nm, respectively, illustrating a slight decrease in DHF affinity (1.5- and 3-fold, respectively) relative to the WT. The high % error on KmDHF results from the low values of KmDHF and the correspondingly low spectrophotometric signal, which was enhanced by the use of 10-cm path length cuvettes. Kinetic data for the F31R variant had previously been reported (10Patel M. Sleep S.E. Lewis W.S. Spencer H.T. Mareya S.M. Sorrentino B.P. Blakley R.L. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 2069-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and compares well with our data, although we determined a KmDHF value that is 6-fold lower than previously reported. Because we expected a low value for KmDHF and a correspondingly low spectrophotometric signal, we used 10-cm cuvettes in KmDHF determination, rather than 1-cm cuvettes (10Patel M. Sleep S.E. Lewis W.S. Spencer H.T. Mareya S.M. Sorrentino B.P. Blakley R.L. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 2069-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This enabled a more precise measurement in the target range. Inhibition constants for MTX (KiMTX) revealed that the F31R substitution (KiMTX = 1.1 nm) confers a 35-fold loss in MTX affinity, whereas the Q35E substitution (KiMTX = 0.048 nm) displays a modest decrease of MTX affinity relative to WT (1.5-fold decrease). Like the F31R variant, the F31R/Q35E variant displayed larger decreases in MTX affinity than DHF affinity relative to the WT. However, the Q35E substitution modestly decreased DHF affinity, while having a negligible effect on MTX affinity. The F31R/Q35E variant presented both of these features, as DHF affinity decreased 9-fold relative to WT, whereas MTX affinity decreased >650-fold relative to the WT. Thus, addition of the Q35E substitution to variant F31R increased the KmDHF of F31R 6-fold while increasing the KiMTX of F31R nearly 20-fold.TABLE 2Kinetic and inhibitory parameters of WT hDHFR and hDHFR variant F31R/Q35EVariantkcatKmDHFkcat/KmDHFΔΔGDHFaΔΔG = −RT × ln(KmDHF WT/KmDHF variant); T = 293 K.IC50MTXKiMTXΔΔGMTXbΔΔG = −RT × ln(KiMTX WT/KiMTX variant); T = 293 K.s−1nms−1 μm−1kcal/molnmnmkcal/molWTcValues were taken from Refs.

This enzyme modifies eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) at serine 53, which leads to inhibition of protein synthesis and death of target cells.

Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative bacterium, causing pulmonary infectious disease in humans. This microorganism is able to infect various free-living protozoa in natural environment as well as macrophages, monocytes, and lung epithelial cells during human disease (1Bitar D.M. Molmeret M.

Rev. 2002; 15: 506-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). A plethora of virulence factors, which are important for intracellular proliferation of the bacteria in target eukaryotic cells, and a type IVB secretion system for intracytoplasmic delivery of these effectors have been identified (3Juhas M. Crook D.W. Hood D.W. Cell Microbiol. 2008; 10: 2377-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Among the best studied Legionella products are RalF (4Nagai H. Kagan J.C. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Roy C.R. Science. 2002; 295: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and DrrA (5Murata T. Delprato A. Ingmundson A. Toomre D.K. Lambright D.G. Roy C.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which act as exchange factors for Arf1 and Rab1 small GTPases, respectively. Additionally, DrrA has been shown to possess activity of a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor-displacement factor (6Ingmundson A. Delprato A. Lambright D.G. Roy C.R. Nature. 2007; 450: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). These two proteins were suggested to participate in recruitment of endosomal vesicles and construction of a replicative phagosome, which is a characteristic intracellular niche of Legionella and prerequisite for subsequent proliferation of the bacteria in host cells (7Ninio S. Roy C.R. Trends Microbiol. 2007; 15: 372-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, despite considerable progress, many aspects of intracellular biology of L. pneumophila, in particular those apart from processes associated with alterations in vesicular trafficking, remain poorly understood.In our previous investigations we identified three proteins in L. pneumophila (Lgt1, Lgt2, and Lgt3), which possess enzymatic activity and modify eukaryotic elongation factor eEF1A 3The abbreviations used are: eEF1Aeukaryotic elongation factor 1AGSTglutathione S-transferaseTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyHbs1heat shock protein 70 subfamily B suppressor 1DOSYdiffusion-ordered spectroscopy. 3The abbreviations used are: eEF1Aeukaryotic elongation factor 1AGSTglutathione S-transferaseTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyHbs1heat shock protein 70 subfamily B suppressor 1DOSYdiffusion-ordered spectroscopy. at serine 53 by mono-O-glucosylation (8Belyi I.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3026-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This modification inhibits protein synthesis and is eventually lethal to target cells. Expression of Lgt1 is strongly increased during late phase of bacterial growth in broth medium and in Acanthamoeba castellanii (10Belyi Y. Tabakova I. Stahl M. Aktories K. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3026-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Because bacteria taken at the stationary phase of growth are known to possess maximal pathogenic potential (11Byrne B. Swanson M.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3029-3034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hammer B.K. Swanson M.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), up-regulation of the glucosyltransferase has been suggested to be involved in virulence of L. pneumophila. Here we studied the recognition of eEF1A1 by Lgt1 and identified the type of glucosylation catalyzed by the enzyme.DISCUSSIONElongation factor eEF1A, with two structurally highly similar isoforms eEF1A1 and eEF1A2, is a large GTP-binding protein, consisting of the N-terminal GTPase domain and two additional domains of β-barrel structure (26Andersen G.R. Nyborg J. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2001; 66: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). L. pneumophila glucosyltransferase Lgt1 glucosylates eEF1A at serine 53, which is located in the GTPase domain of the elongation factor (9Belyi Y. Niggeweg R. Opitz B. Vogelsgesang M. Hippenstiel S. Wilm M. Aktories K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16953-16958Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here we studied the substrate recognition of eEF1A by Lgt1. Our studies show that domains 2 and 3 of eEF1A are fully dispensable for glucosylation by Lgt1. Moreover, efficient glucosylation by Lgt1 was observed with the decapeptide 50GKGSFKYAWV59 as a substrate. This suggests that the three-dimensional structure of eEF1A is not important for recognition by Lgt1.Many bacterial protein toxins are characterized by extremely high substrate specificity. These examples include C. difficile toxins A and B, which are at least distantly related to Lgt1 (9Belyi Y. Niggeweg R. Opitz B. Vogelsgesang M. Hippenstiel S. Wilm M. Aktories K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16953-16958Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), as well as other members of the glucosylating clostridial toxin family. They modify small GTPases of the Rho and/or Ras family in a highly specific manner, depending on the intact folding of the whole substrate protein (27Jank T. Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 222-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For example, change of serine 73 to phenylalanine in RhoA turned RhoA into a substrate for lethal toxin of C. sordellii. Similarly, substitution of phenylalanine 85 in RhoD with serine allowed its glucosylation by toxin B of C. difficile (28Jank T. Pack U. Giesemann T. Schmidt G. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19527-19535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cytotoxic necrotizing factors CNF of E. coli needs only a rather small Rho peptide of 20 residues to catalyze deamidation of the target glutamine residue (29Lerm M. Schmidt G. Goehring U.M. Schirmer J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28999-29004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Even smaller is the minimum peptide of eEF1A, which is modified by Lgt1. It contains the sequence 50GKGSFKYAWV59 and forms the loop, which is a part of the helix-loop-helix structure of helices A* and A′ of eEF1A. Whereas glycine 50 is the first residue of this loop, the loop ends with lysine 55. Tyrosine 56 and the other residues of the peptide form the first turn of helix A′. Serine 53 is located in the middle of the loop and apparently is freely accessible at the surface of eEF1A.Even smaller truncations (e.g. KGSFKYAWV, GKGSFKYAW, and KGSFKYAW) were substrates for Lgt1, although glucosylation was less efficient. As one can deduce from the experiments, the COOH-terminal part of the peptide was more important for its substrate activity than the NH2-terminal part. In line with this notion were results of mutagenesis studies. Substitution of amino acid residues located COOH-terminally (e.g. lysine 55, tyrosine 56, alanine 57, or tryptophan 58) caused major reduction in glucosylation and substitution of phenylalanine 54 completely prevented glucosylation of the neighboring serine 53.Glucosylation of serine 53 of eEF1A inhibits protein synthesis (9Belyi Y. Niggeweg R. Opitz B. Vogelsgesang M. Hippenstiel S. Wilm M. Aktories K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16953-16958Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the functional consequences of the modification of serine 53 are not clear on the molecular level. Serine 53, which is glucosylated by Lgt1 in eEF1A, is not present in prokaryotic EF1A (known as EF-Tu) but conserved in many eukaryotic elongation factors 1A. Whereas glucosylation of the small GTPase RhoA by clostridial glucosyltransferases modifies threonine 37, which is essential for nucleotide binding and coordination of magnesium (30Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), the glucosylation site (serine 53) in eEF1A is not directly involved in nucleotide binding. Glucosylation of RhoA and Ras by clostridial toxins inhibits the active conformation of the protein. The exposed location of serine 53 in eEF1A rather suggests that glucosylation of the elongation factor interferes with binding and/or interaction with other proteins or factors, eventually resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis.Interestingly, the rate of glucosylation of peptide 50GKGSFKYAWV59 was at least 20-fold higher than the glucosylation of a native full-length eEF1A or its recombinant G domain. This suggests that a specific conformation of eEF1A might be the preferred substrate of Lgt1. However, our attempts to find out conditions that cause a major increase in glucosylation by Lgt1 have been unsuccessful so far.The short peptide, which was recognized by Lgt1 as a substrate for glucosylation, prompted us to search for other proteins, harboring this sequence. A BLAST search identified Hsp70 subfamily B suppressor 1 (Hbs1) as a putative target for glucosylation. Recombinant Hbs1 was readily modified by Lgt1-induced glucosylation. Initially Hbs1 was identified in yeast screens as a 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein, which suppressed defects caused by a proteasome mutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (31Ohba M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Later it was shown that Hbs1 possesses strong homology to release factor eRF3 (32Wallrapp C. Verrier S.B. Zhouravleva G. Philippe H. Philippe M. Gress T.M. Jean-Jean O. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hbs1 and Hbs1-interacting eRF1-related factor Dom34 appear to be important for efficient protein synthesis in and growth of yeast cells under conditions of limiting translation initiation (33Carr-Schmid A. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2564-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In more recent reports, relationships between Hbs1 function and ribosomal mRNA translation were described (34Doma M.K. Parker R. Nature. 2006; 440: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 35Graille M. Chaillet M. van Tilbeurgh H. J. Biol.

At present we have no experimental confirmation of the role of glucosylation of Hbs1 in Legionella intracellular biology or disease. However, it should be noted that both identified targets of Lgt1, namely eEF1A and Hbs1, represent important components of protein synthesis machinery in eukaryotic cells. In our previous studies we demonstrated that the glucosylation of eEF1A takes place following intoxication of EBL cells by Lgt1 (9Belyi Y. Niggeweg R. Opitz B. Vogelsgesang M. Hippenstiel S. Wilm M. Aktories K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16953-16958Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However we cannot exclude that modification of Hbs1 is also of importance for Lgt1-induced biological effects (e.g. inhibition of protein synthesis).The identification of a small peptide that is glucosylated by Lgt1 allowed us to study the stereochemical structure of the O-glycosidic bond formed. The anomeric configuration of the product of glucosylation can be either retained or inverted with respect to the donor co-substrate (37Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Here we show by NMR spectroscopy that Lgt1 belongs to the retaining type of glucosyltransferases. Therefore, Lgt1 is similar to the clostridial glucosylating toxins, which glucosylate Rho and/or Ras GTPases in a retaining reaction (27Jank T. Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 222-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 38Geyer M. Wilde C. Selzer J. Aktories K. Kalbitzer H.R.

Sequence comparison of Lgt1 with clostridial toxins have shown some sequence similarity in the surrounding of the conserved DXD motif, which is involved in coordination of manganese ions and binding of the activated co-substrate UDP-glucose. It remains to be studied whether the structure of the catalytic domain of Lgt1 is related to clostridial glucosyltransferases.

In our previous investigations we identified three proteins in L. pneumophila (Lgt1, Lgt2, and Lgt3), which possess enzymatic activity and modify eukaryotic elongation factor eEF1A 3The abbreviations used are: eEF1Aeukaryotic elongation factor 1AGSTglutathione S-transferaseTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyHbs1heat shock protein 70 subfamily B suppressor 1DOSYdiffusion-ordered spectroscopy. 3The abbreviations used are: eEF1Aeukaryotic elongation factor 1AGSTglutathione S-transferaseTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyHbs1heat shock protein 70 subfamily B suppressor 1DOSYdiffusion-ordered spectroscopy. at serine 53 by mono-O-glucosylation (8Belyi I.

Expression of Lgt1 is strongly increased during late phase of bacterial growth in broth medium and in Acanthamoeba castellanii (10Belyi Y. Tabakova I. Stahl M. Aktories K. J.

DISCUSSIONElongation factor eEF1A, with two structurally highly similar isoforms eEF1A1 and eEF1A2, is a large GTP-binding protein, consisting of the N-terminal GTPase domain and two additional domains of β-barrel structure (26Andersen G.R. Nyborg J. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2001; 66: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). L. pneumophila glucosyltransferase Lgt1 glucosylates eEF1A at serine 53, which is located in the GTPase domain of the elongation factor (9Belyi Y. Niggeweg R. Opitz B. Vogelsgesang M. Hippenstiel S. Wilm M. Aktories K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16953-16958Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here we studied the substrate recognition of eEF1A by Lgt1. Our studies show that domains 2 and 3 of eEF1A are fully dispensable for glucosylation by Lgt1. Moreover, efficient glucosylation by Lgt1 was observed with the decapeptide 50GKGSFKYAWV59 as a substrate. This suggests that the three-dimensional structure of eEF1A is not important for recognition by Lgt1.Many bacterial protein toxins are characterized by extremely high substrate specificity. These examples include C. difficile toxins A and B, which are at least distantly related to Lgt1 (9Belyi Y. Niggeweg R. Opitz B. Vogelsgesang M. Hippenstiel S. Wilm M. Aktories K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16953-16958Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), as well as other members of the glucosylating clostridial toxin family. They modify small GTPases of the Rho and/or Ras family in a highly specific manner, depending on the intact folding of the whole substrate protein (27Jank T. Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 222-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For example, change of serine 73 to phenylalanine in RhoA turned RhoA into a substrate for lethal toxin of C. sordellii. Similarly, substitution of phenylalanine 85 in RhoD with serine allowed its glucosylation by toxin B of C. difficile (28Jank T. Pack U. Giesemann T. Schmidt G. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19527-19535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cytotoxic necrotizing factors CNF of E. coli needs only a rather small Rho peptide of 20 residues to catalyze deamidation of the target glutamine residue (29Lerm M. Schmidt G. Goehring U.M. Schirmer J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28999-29004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Even smaller is the minimum peptide of eEF1A, which is modified by Lgt1. It contains the sequence 50GKGSFKYAWV59 and forms the loop, which is a part of the helix-loop-helix structure of helices A* and A′ of eEF1A. Whereas glycine 50 is the first residue of this loop, the loop ends with lysine 55. Tyrosine 56 and the other residues of the peptide form the first turn of helix A′. Serine 53 is located in the middle of the loop and apparently is freely accessible at the surface of eEF1A.Even smaller truncations (e.g. KGSFKYAWV, GKGSFKYAW, and KGSFKYAW) were substrates for Lgt1, although glucosylation was less efficient. As one can deduce from the experiments, the COOH-terminal part of the peptide was more important for its substrate activity than the NH2-terminal part. In line with this notion were results of mutagenesis studies. Substitution of amino acid residues located COOH-terminally (e.g. lysine 55, tyrosine 56, alanine 57, or tryptophan 58) caused major reduction in glucosylation and substitution of phenylalanine 54 completely prevented glucosylation of the neighboring serine 53.Glucosylation of serine 53 of eEF1A inhibits protein synthesis (9Belyi Y. Niggeweg R. Opitz B. Vogelsgesang M. Hippenstiel S. Wilm M. Aktories K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16953-16958Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the functional consequences of the modification of serine 53 are not clear on the molecular level. Serine 53, which is glucosylated by Lgt1 in eEF1A, is not present in prokaryotic EF1A (known as EF-Tu) but conserved in many eukaryotic elongation factors 1A. Whereas glucosylation of the small GTPase RhoA by clostridial glucosyltransferases modifies threonine 37, which is essential for nucleotide binding and coordination of magnesium (30Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), the glucosylation site (serine 53) in eEF1A is not directly involved in nucleotide binding. Glucosylation of RhoA and Ras by clostridial toxins inhibits the active conformation of the protein. The exposed location of serine 53 in eEF1A rather suggests that glucosylation of the elongation factor interferes with binding and/or interaction with other proteins or factors, eventually resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis.Interestingly, the rate of glucosylation of peptide 50GKGSFKYAWV59 was at least 20-fold higher than the glucosylation of a native full-length eEF1A or its recombinant G domain. This suggests that a specific conformation of eEF1A might be the preferred substrate of Lgt1. However, our attempts to find out conditions that cause a major increase in glucosylation by Lgt1 have been unsuccessful so far.The short peptide, which was recognized by Lgt1 as a substrate for glucosylation, prompted us to search for other proteins, harboring this sequence. A BLAST search identified Hsp70 subfamily B suppressor 1 (Hbs1) as a putative target for glucosylation. Recombinant Hbs1 was readily modified by Lgt1-induced glucosylation. Initially Hbs1 was identified in yeast screens as a 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein, which suppressed defects caused by a proteasome mutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (31Ohba M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Later it was shown that Hbs1 possesses strong homology to release factor eRF3 (32Wallrapp C. Verrier S.B. Zhouravleva G. Philippe H. Philippe M. Gress T.M. Jean-Jean O. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hbs1 and Hbs1-interacting eRF1-related factor Dom34 appear to be important for efficient protein synthesis in and growth of yeast cells under conditions of limiting translation initiation (33Carr-Schmid A. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2564-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In more recent reports, relationships between Hbs1 function and ribosomal mRNA translation were described (34Doma M.K. Parker R.

At present we have no experimental confirmation of the role of glucosylation of Hbs1 in Legionella intracellular biology or disease. However, it should be noted that both identified targets of Lgt1, namely eEF1A and Hbs1, represent important components of protein synthesis machinery in eukaryotic cells. In our previous studies we demonstrated that the glucosylation of eEF1A takes place following intoxication of EBL cells by Lgt1 (9Belyi Y. Niggeweg R. Opitz B. Vogelsgesang M. Hippenstiel S. Wilm M. Aktories K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16953-16958Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However we cannot exclude that modification of Hbs1 is also of importance for Lgt1-induced biological effects (e.g. inhibition of protein synthesis).The identification of a small peptide that is glucosylated by Lgt1 allowed us to study the stereochemical structure of the O-glycosidic bond formed. The anomeric configuration of the product of glucosylation can be either retained or inverted with respect to the donor co-substrate (37Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Here we show by NMR spectroscopy that Lgt1 belongs to the retaining type of glucosyltransferases. Therefore, Lgt1 is similar to the clostridial glucosylating toxins, which glucosylate Rho and/or Ras GTPases in a retaining reaction (27Jank T. Aktories K.

Sequence comparison of Lgt1 with clostridial toxins have shown some sequence similarity in the surrounding of the conserved DXD motif, which is involved in coordination of manganese ions and binding of the activated co-substrate UDP-glucose.

These results were recapitulated in the complementation assay where administration of 1 μm C11 produced a significant increase in polymerized Tau relative to control, whereas treatment of cells with 0.01 μm C11 resulted in a marked reduction of aggregated Tau. In the organotypic slice cultures, modulation of Tau aggregation was independent of changes in phosphorylation at disease and microtubule binding relevant epitopes for both dosing regimes.

Abnormal accumulation of aggregated proteins is a common feature of many neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson, Huntington, and Alzheimer diseases.

Under normal conditions, as much as 90% of the Tau expressed in neurons is bound to microtubules providing stability for the cytoskeleton. In addition, Tau may also play a role in the microtubule interactions of both Golgi membranes and dynein (1Farah C.A. Perreault S. Liazoghli D. Desjardins M. Anton A. Lauzon M. Paiement J. Leclerc N.

N744 was capable of inhibiting filament formation at substoichiometric concentrations with an IC50 of 294 ± 23 nm (25Chirita C. Necula M. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2879-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Analysis utilizing electron microscopy revealed that N744 was capable of reducing both total filament mass and filament number. Also, substoichiometric concentrations of N744 were capable of disaggregating mature filaments. Over 19 h of incubation total filament length was reduced to 13 ± 2% of the control (25Chirita C. Necula M. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2879-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast to other polymerization inhibitors, length distribution remained unchanged with N744 treatment. This is not inconsequential as these results indicate that disaggregation was endwise rather than the result of random breakage. Interestingly, further study revealed that N744 activity is biphasic with optimal inhibition occurring at ∼4 μm (26Congdon E.E. Necula M. Blackstone R.D. Kuret J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 465: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Above this concentration, inhibition is relieved and polymerization levels greater than control samples are observed at higher drug concentrations. These changes are reflected by changes in the equilibrium constant, or minimal concentration, for Tau polymerization. In the inhibitory range, increasing doses of N744 produced corresponding increases in the critical concentration. In contrast, higher concentrations of N744 resulted in a lowering of the equilibrium constant. Although N744 is not capable of directly triggering Tau polymerization, it appears capable of increasing the concentration of Tau available for incorporation into fibrils by competitively binding to the negatively charged surfaces presented by polymerization inducers (26Congdon E.E. Necula M. Blackstone R.D. Kuret J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 465: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate the potential usefulness of cyanine dyes as candidates for development as therapeutics and use in hypothesis testing.Within the cyanine dye family, there are multiple commercially available molecules that vary with respect to the meso substituent, bridge length, and N substituent. Of these, 3,3′-diethyl-9-methylthiacarbocyanine iodide (C11) was found to have a similar potency in vitro to N744 (28Chang E. Congdon E.E. Honson N.S. Duff K.E. Kuret J. J. Med. Chem. 2009; (in press)Google Scholar). In addition, the molecular properties of C11 present distinct advantages compared with N744. Comparisons of topological polar surface area, octanol water partition coefficient (miLogP), and molecular weight indicate that C11 is more likely to cross the blood-brain barrier, and thus was chosen for further study.Here we examine the effects of cyanine dye C11 over a wide concentration range in a transfected cell and an ex vivo culture system making aggregated, tangle-type Tau. An inactive cyanine, C2, was used to control for nonspecific effects of the cyanine scaffold. Two different culture systems were utilized to assay the effects of cyanine treatment on Tau polymerization. In the first, organotypic slices were cultured from the hTau mouse line that expresses all six isoforms of wild type human Tau. Slice cultures accumulate a robust level of aggregated Tau in a physiologically relevant milieu. In addition, because the hemispheres are plated separately, one hemisphere may be retained to serve as a within-animal control, thus eliminating the problem of variable aggregate levels between animals. A second culture system utilized human embryonic kidney cells transfected with split GFP-labeled Tau. In this assay, GFP fluorescence is altered upon Tau aggregation with higher degrees of polymerization resulting in reduced GFP signal (29Chun W. Waldo G.S. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 2529-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This system allows for a high number of replicates as well as fast and quantitative measurements. Results show that C11 is capable of significantly reducing levels of aggregated Tau at submicromolar concentrations (0.001 μm) with no effects on polymerization with C2. In addition, these effects were not dependent on changes in phosphorylation state.DISCUSSIONInsoluble Tau polymers accumulate in affected cells in a host of neurodegenerative conditions. Identification of compounds capable of reducing the burden of aggregated Tau could potentially result in the creation of disease-modifying therapies. One such example, methylthioninium chloride (methylene blue, RemberTM), which has been shown to reduce Tau fibrillization in vitro (24Taniguchi S. Suzuki N. Masuda M. Hisanaga S. Iwatsubo T. Goedert M. Hasegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7614-7623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 47Wischik C.M. Edwards P.C. Lai R.Y. Roth M. Harrington C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 11213-11218Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), is the subject of clinical trials.In vitro studies have shown that small molecule cyanine dyes are capable of selectively binding to abnormally folded Tau protein and modulating its polymerization in a biphasic, dose-dependent manner (25Chirita C. Necula M. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2879-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have shown that it is possible to recapitulate these results in an organotypic slice culture system. Cyanine dye C11 is capable of either significantly reducing, or increasing the levels of Sarkosyl-insoluble Tau. Indeed, inhibition is possible at submicromolar concentrations without affecting normal microtubule binding or adverse effects on synaptic integrity. As a control, a similar molecule (C2) determined to be inactive in vitro was utilized to assess nonspecific effects of the cyanine skeleton. No changes were seen in the relative amounts of total, soluble and polymerized Tau relative to untreated slices. Furthermore, no changes were seen in tubulin, synaptophysin, or cleaved PARP with C2 treatment. In addition, effects on polymerization were not dependent on alterations in Tau phosphorylation, indicating that a reduction in occupancy at phosphoepitopes is not required to reduce Tau filament burden. These results also suggest that increased levels of soluble, hyperphosphorylated Tau monomers are not toxic to the slice cultures. However, at present, slices have only been incubated with C11 for 1 week in culture. It may require longer periods of incubation, or additional assay methods for toxicity to become apparent. Furthermore, these results have been confirmed using a second model system. In these studies, low doses of C11 were capable of significantly reducing the levels of aggregated Tau in cells transfected with the longest human Tau isoform.In contrast, treatment with 1 μm C11 produced a significant elevation of polymerized Tau with a marked decrease in the levels of soluble tubulin. This was accompanied by an increase in tubulin in the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction. Studies utilizing N744 suggest that a possible mechanism by which cyanine dyes facilitate Tau polymerization is through competitive binding. Dye polymers were capable of displacing Tau from the surface of negatively charged polystyrene microspheres and thus raising the concentration of Tau in solution. A similar process may be occurring in the slice cultures. Incubation with higher doses of C11 may result in the displacement of Tau from the microtubule surface. This would result in an increase in the concentration of Tau available for incorporation into aggregates. Additionally, previous studies have shown that several microtubule-associated proteins such as microtubule-associated proteins 1 and 2 can be sequestered into neurofibrillary lesions and the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction. It may be that additional microtubule-associated proteins are also being recruited into the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction and this loss of support results in the destabilization of the microtubules. This destabilization could then allow tubulin dimers to be likewise sequestered in the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction. Loss of tubulin and increased Tau filament burden does not, however, appear to result in increased toxicity after 1 week. No loss of synaptic integrity or activation of pro-apoptotic caspases was observed. On a superficial level, slices treated with 1 μm C11 did not appear less healthy than control, neutral, or low dose-treated cultures. As stated above, longer incubation times may be necessary to observe toxic effects. Further studies will be necessary to fully evaluate the consequences of altered Tau polymerization.Similar to N744, the dose-response relationship of C11 indicates the existence of a therapeutic index. Among compounds that act on amyloid-forming proteins, this is not unheard of. A similar dose-response effect was observed with Congo Red in models of Huntington disease. In vitro, Congo Red has a monophasic and steep dose-response curve (48Heiser V. Scherzinger E. Boeddrich A. Nordhoff E. Lurz R. Schugardt N. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6739-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, in biological models, a more complex pattern emerges. Low concentrations inhibited huntingtin polymerization with higher doses resulting in relief of that inhibition (49Smith D.L. Portier R. Woodman B. Hockly E. Mahal A. Klunk W.E. Li X.J. Wanker E. Murray K.D. Bates G.P. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similarly, although it retains its biphasic shape, the dose-response curve of C11 shifts depending on the model system utilized. Although this may limit the utility of C11, it should be noted that a 100–1000-fold increase in concentration is required to promote Tau aggregation. Additionally, these results indicate that results obtained in animals or tissue culture with aggregation inhibitors identified in vitro must be interpreted carefully. Indeed, what may appear to be a negative result may in fact occur because the dose-response curve has shifted due to changing model systems. This may result in promising compounds being abandoned unnecessarily.Finally, these findings further demonstrate the potential utility of cyanine dyes. This class of molecules has also been successfully used in cell culture as inhibitors of nitric oxide production (50Tseng H.Y. Wu S.H. Huang W.H. Wang S.F. Yang Y.N. Mahindroo N. Hsu T. Jiaang W.T. Lee S.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15: 2027-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, a cyanine dye, Platonin, has been shown to reduce tissue damage and improve survival in a rat model of heat stroke (51Tsai C.C. Lin M.T. Yang C.C. Liao J.F. Lee J.J. Shock. 2006; 26: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cyanines have also demonstrated utility as contrast agents (52Licha K. Riefke B. Ntziachristos V. Becker A. Chance B. Semmler W. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 72: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 53Volkova K.D. Kovalska V.B. Balanda A.O. Vermeij R.J. Subramaniam V. Slominskii Y.L. Yarmoluk S.M. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 2007; 70: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and one, Cardio Green, has been approved for use in humans. Together with the results described above, these data indicate the potential of this class of compounds for further development as potential therapies. Abnormal accumulation of aggregated proteins is a common feature of many neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson, Huntington, and Alzheimer diseases. The defining lesions in Alzheimer disease include the extracellular plaques composed of amyloid β and intracellular polymers of the microtubule-associated protein Tau. Under normal conditions, as much as 90% of the Tau expressed in neurons is bound to microtubules providing stability for the cytoskeleton. In addition, Tau may also play a role in the microtubule interactions of both Golgi membranes and dynein (1Farah C.A. Perreault S. Liazoghli D. Desjardins M. Anton A. Lauzon M. Paiement J. Leclerc N.

Intracellular Tau aggregates are a defining feature in a host of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer disease, corticobasal degeneration, and frontotemporal dementia.

Necula M. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2879-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Congdon E.E. Necula M. Blackstone R.D. Kuret J. Arch. Biochem.

N744 was capable of inhibiting filament formation at substoichiometric concentrations with an IC50 of 294 ± 23 nm (25Chirita C. Necula M. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2879-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Analysis utilizing electron microscopy revealed that N744 was capable of reducing both total filament mass and filament number. Also, substoichiometric concentrations of N744 were capable of disaggregating mature filaments. Over 19 h of incubation total filament length was reduced to 13 ± 2% of the control (25Chirita C. Necula M. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2879-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast to other polymerization inhibitors, length distribution remained unchanged with N744 treatment. This is not inconsequential as these results indicate that disaggregation was endwise rather than the result of random breakage. Interestingly, further study revealed that N744 activity is biphasic with optimal inhibition occurring at ∼4 μm (26Congdon E.E. Necula M. Blackstone R.D. Kuret J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 465: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Above this concentration, inhibition is relieved and polymerization levels greater than control samples are observed at higher drug concentrations. These changes are reflected by changes in the equilibrium constant, or minimal concentration, for Tau polymerization. In the inhibitory range, increasing doses of N744 produced corresponding increases in the critical concentration. In contrast, higher concentrations of N744 resulted in a lowering of the equilibrium constant. Although N744 is not capable of directly triggering Tau polymerization, it appears capable of increasing the concentration of Tau available for incorporation into fibrils by competitively binding to the negatively charged surfaces presented by polymerization inducers (26Congdon E.E. Necula M. Blackstone R.D. Kuret J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 465: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate the potential usefulness of cyanine dyes as candidates for development as therapeutics and use in hypothesis testing. 3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-[2-[[3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-5-methoxy-2-benzthiazolylidene]methyl]-1-butenyl]-5-methoxybenzothiazolium 3,3′-diethyl-9-methyl-thiacarbocyanine iodide poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase dimethyl sulfoxide green fluorescent protein 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-[2-[[3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-5-methoxy-2-benzthiazolylidene]methyl]-1-butenyl]-5-methoxybenzothiazolium 3,3′-diethyl-9-methyl-thiacarbocyanine iodide poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase dimethyl sulfoxide green fluorescent protein 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. Within the cyanine dye family, there are multiple commercially available molecules that vary with respect to the meso substituent, bridge length, and N substituent. Of these, 3,3′-diethyl-9-methylthiacarbocyanine iodide (C11) was found to have a similar potency in vitro to N744 (28Chang E. Congdon E.E. Honson N.S. Duff K.E. Kuret J. J. Med. Chem. 2009; (in press)Google Scholar). In addition, the molecular properties of C11 present distinct advantages compared with N744. Comparisons of topological polar surface area, octanol water partition coefficient (miLogP), and molecular weight indicate that C11 is more likely to cross the blood-brain barrier, and thus was chosen for further study. Here we examine the effects of cyanine dye C11 over a wide concentration range in a transfected cell and an ex vivo culture system making aggregated, tangle-type Tau. An inactive cyanine, C2, was used to control for nonspecific effects of the cyanine scaffold. Two different culture systems were utilized to assay the effects of cyanine treatment on Tau polymerization. In the first, organotypic slices were cultured from the hTau mouse line that expresses all six isoforms of wild type human Tau. Slice cultures accumulate a robust level of aggregated Tau in a physiologically relevant milieu. In addition, because the hemispheres are plated separately, one hemisphere may be retained to serve as a within-animal control, thus eliminating the problem of variable aggregate levels between animals. A second culture system utilized human embryonic kidney cells transfected with split GFP-labeled Tau. In this assay, GFP fluorescence is altered upon Tau aggregation with higher degrees of polymerization resulting in reduced GFP signal (29Chun W. Waldo G.S. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 2529-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This system allows for a high number of replicates as well as fast and quantitative measurements. Results show that C11 is capable of significantly reducing levels of aggregated Tau at submicromolar concentrations (0.001 μm) with no effects on polymerization with C2. In addition, these effects were not dependent on changes in phosphorylation state. DISCUSSIONInsoluble Tau polymers accumulate in affected cells in a host of neurodegenerative conditions. Identification of compounds capable of reducing the burden of aggregated Tau could potentially result in the creation of disease-modifying therapies. One such example, methylthioninium chloride (methylene blue, RemberTM), which has been shown to reduce Tau fibrillization in vitro (24Taniguchi S. Suzuki N. Masuda M. Hisanaga S. Iwatsubo T. Goedert M. Hasegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7614-7623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 47Wischik C.M. Edwards P.C. Lai R.Y. Roth M. Harrington C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 11213-11218Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), is the subject of clinical trials.In vitro studies have shown that small molecule cyanine dyes are capable of selectively binding to abnormally folded Tau protein and modulating its polymerization in a biphasic, dose-dependent manner (25Chirita C. Necula M. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2879-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have shown that it is possible to recapitulate these results in an organotypic slice culture system. Cyanine dye C11 is capable of either significantly reducing, or increasing the levels of Sarkosyl-insoluble Tau. Indeed, inhibition is possible at submicromolar concentrations without affecting normal microtubule binding or adverse effects on synaptic integrity. As a control, a similar molecule (C2) determined to be inactive in vitro was utilized to assess nonspecific effects of the cyanine skeleton. No changes were seen in the relative amounts of total, soluble and polymerized Tau relative to untreated slices. Furthermore, no changes were seen in tubulin, synaptophysin, or cleaved PARP with C2 treatment. In addition, effects on polymerization were not dependent on alterations in Tau phosphorylation, indicating that a reduction in occupancy at phosphoepitopes is not required to reduce Tau filament burden. These results also suggest that increased levels of soluble, hyperphosphorylated Tau monomers are not toxic to the slice cultures. However, at present, slices have only been incubated with C11 for 1 week in culture. It may require longer periods of incubation, or additional assay methods for toxicity to become apparent. Furthermore, these results have been confirmed using a second model system. In these studies, low doses of C11 were capable of significantly reducing the levels of aggregated Tau in cells transfected with the longest human Tau isoform.In contrast, treatment with 1 μm C11 produced a significant elevation of polymerized Tau with a marked decrease in the levels of soluble tubulin. This was accompanied by an increase in tubulin in the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction. Studies utilizing N744 suggest that a possible mechanism by which cyanine dyes facilitate Tau polymerization is through competitive binding. Dye polymers were capable of displacing Tau from the surface of negatively charged polystyrene microspheres and thus raising the concentration of Tau in solution. A similar process may be occurring in the slice cultures. Incubation with higher doses of C11 may result in the displacement of Tau from the microtubule surface. This would result in an increase in the concentration of Tau available for incorporation into aggregates. Additionally, previous studies have shown that several microtubule-associated proteins such as microtubule-associated proteins 1 and 2 can be sequestered into neurofibrillary lesions and the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction. It may be that additional microtubule-associated proteins are also being recruited into the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction and this loss of support results in the destabilization of the microtubules. This destabilization could then allow tubulin dimers to be likewise sequestered in the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction. Loss of tubulin and increased Tau filament burden does not, however, appear to result in increased toxicity after 1 week. No loss of synaptic integrity or activation of pro-apoptotic caspases was observed. On a superficial level, slices treated with 1 μm C11 did not appear less healthy than control, neutral, or low dose-treated cultures. As stated above, longer incubation times may be necessary to observe toxic effects. Further studies will be necessary to fully evaluate the consequences of altered Tau polymerization.Similar to N744, the dose-response relationship of C11 indicates the existence of a therapeutic index. Among compounds that act on amyloid-forming proteins, this is not unheard of. A similar dose-response effect was observed with Congo Red in models of Huntington disease. In vitro, Congo Red has a monophasic and steep dose-response curve (48Heiser V. Scherzinger E. Boeddrich A. Nordhoff E. Lurz R. Schugardt N. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6739-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, in biological models, a more complex pattern emerges. Low concentrations inhibited huntingtin polymerization with higher doses resulting in relief of that inhibition (49Smith D.L. Portier R. Woodman B. Hockly E. Mahal A. Klunk W.E. Li X.J. Wanker E. Murray K.D. Bates G.P. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similarly, although it retains its biphasic shape, the dose-response curve of C11 shifts depending on the model system utilized. Although this may limit the utility of C11, it should be noted that a 100–1000-fold increase in concentration is required to promote Tau aggregation. Additionally, these results indicate that results obtained in animals or tissue culture with aggregation inhibitors identified in vitro must be interpreted carefully. Indeed, what may appear to be a negative result may in fact occur because the dose-response curve has shifted due to changing model systems. This may result in promising compounds being abandoned unnecessarily.Finally, these findings further demonstrate the potential utility of cyanine dyes. This class of molecules has also been successfully used in cell culture as inhibitors of nitric oxide production (50Tseng H.Y. Wu S.H. Huang W.H. Wang S.F. Yang Y.N. Mahindroo N. Hsu T. Jiaang W.T.

In addition, a cyanine dye, Platonin, has been shown to reduce tissue damage and improve survival in a rat model of heat stroke (51Tsai C.C. Lin M.T. Yang C.C. Liao J.F. Lee J.J. Shock. 2006; 26: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cyanines have also demonstrated utility as contrast agents (52Licha K. Riefke B. Ntziachristos V. Becker A. Chance B. Semmler W.

https://openalex.org/W2007920520,"Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a common birth defect predominantly affecting the forebrain and face and has been linked to mutations in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) gene. HPE is genetically heterogeneous, and clinical presentation represents a spectrum of phenotypes. We have previously shown that Gas1 encodes a cell-autonomous Hedgehog signaling enhancer. Combining cell surface binding, in vitro activity, and explant culture assays, we provide evidence that SHH contains a previously unknown unique binding surface for its interaction with GAS1 and that this surface is also important for maximal signaling activity. Within this surface, the Asn-115 residue of human SHH has been documented to associate with HPE when mutated to lysine (N115K). We provide evidence that HPE associated with this mutation can be mechanistically explained by a severely reduced binding of SHH to GAS1, and we predict a similar result if a mutation were to occur at Tyr-80. Our data should encourage future searches for mutations in GAS1 as possible modifiers contributing to the wide spectrum of HPE."
https://openalex.org/W2129587261,"Oxidoreductases of the cytochrome bc(1)/b(6)f family transfer electrons from a liposoluble quinol to a soluble acceptor protein and contribute to the formation of a transmembrane electrochemical potential. The crystal structure of cyt b(6)f has revealed the presence in the Q(i) site of an atypical c-type heme, heme c(i). Surprisingly, the protein does not provide any axial ligand to the iron of this heme, and its surrounding structure suggests it can be accessed by exogenous ligand. In this work we describe a mutagenesis approach aimed at characterizing the c(i) heme and its interaction with the Q(i) site environment. We engineered a mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in which Phe(40) from subunit IV was substituted by a tyrosine. This results in a dramatic slowing down of the reoxidation of the b hemes under single flash excitation, suggesting hindered accessibility of the heme to its quinone substrate. This modified accessibility likely originates from the ligation of the heme iron by the phenol(ate) side chain introduced by the mutation. Indeed, it also results in a marked downshift of the c(i) heme midpoint potential (from +100 mV to -200 mV at pH 7). Yet the overall turnover rate of the mutant cytochrome b(6)f complex under continuous illumination was found similar to the wild type one, both in vitro and in vivo. We propose that, in the mutant, a change in the ligation state of the heme upon its reduction could act as a redox switch that would control the accessibility of the substrate to the heme and trigger the catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1977658561,"The cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of connexins has been implicated in multiple aspects of gap junction function, including connexin trafficking/assembly and channel gating. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the first 23 amino acids of human connexin37 was prepared, and circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance studies showed that this N-terminal peptide was predominantly alpha-helical between glycine 5 and glutamate 16. The importance of this structure for localization of the protein at appositional membranes and channel function was tested by expression of site-directed mutants of connexin37 in which amino acids leucine 10 and glutamine 15 were replaced with prolines or alanines. Wild type connexin37 and both substitution mutants localized to appositional membranes between transfected HeLa cells. The proline mutant did not allow intercellular transfer of microinjected neurobiotin; the alanine mutant allowed transfer, but less extensively than wild type connexin37. When expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes, wild type connexin37 produced hemichannel currents, but neither of the double substitution mutants produced detectable currents. The proline mutant (but not the alanine mutant) inhibited co-expressed wild type connexin37. Taken together, our data suggest that the alpha-helical structure of the connexin37 N terminus may be dispensable for protein localization, but it is required for channel and hemichannel function."
https://openalex.org/W2081522807,"Forkhead factors are important regulators of animal development and homeostasis. They are among the earliest to bind quiescent genes, which they activate in conjunction with other transcription factors. Many liver-specific genes are under the control of FoxA2, a liver-enriched forkhead protein. Here we confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation that FoxA2 is one of the factors bound to the promoter-proximal enhancer of the gene encoding apolipoprotein AI (a component of high density lipoprotein) and that it functions in synergy with the nuclear receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α. Furthermore, toward identifying additional cofactors that could potentially regulate FoxA2 activity, we identified DNA-de pend ent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as a FoxA2-associated factor upon affinity purification of epitope-tagged FoxA2. We show that FoxA2, found to be a phosphoprotein in vivo, is also an efficient substrate for DNA-PK, which targets serine 283. This residue is contained within a conserved serine-glutamine phos pho ryl a tion signal for DNA-PK, located within the C-terminal third of the polypeptide, just distal to its winged-helix DNA binding domain. We establish that this residue is critical for FoxA2 function because FoxA2 bearing a mutation at this site is severely compromised in its ability to activate a reporter gene under the control of its cognate DNA-binding site (apoAI site B). Complementary experiments rule out that this mutation compromises the ability of FoxA2 to either translocate to the nucleus or to bind site B. We therefore conclude that DNA-PK-de pend ent phos pho ryl a tion of FoxA2 plays a critical role in its transcriptional activation function per se.

Transcriptional control of mRNA genes is achieved through multiprotein complexes that are targeted to promoter and enhancer regions of these genes by regulatory factors that recognize specific DNA sequences. Typically, several such factors, or transcriptional activators, each respond to a particular signal but act together in a synergistic fashion to control the expression of the target gene. Thus, the unique temporal and spatial expression program of a given gene is hard-wired into the regulatory sequences contained within its enhancer and promoter regions (1Brivanlou A.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 2002; 295: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 2Roeder R.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar).Transcriptional activators recruit different classes of coactivators, which function broadly on at least two levels (3Roeder R.G.

Some coactivators function at the earliest stage of gene activation by acting on the chromatin template to make it more amenable to the action of factors that enter later in the process. Many of these coactivators possess enzymatic activities whose effects range from ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling to covalent modifications of histones that include acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitylation (2Roeder R.G.

Among these, FoxA2 (previously known as HNF-3β) appears to play a major role (11Harnish D.C. Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28220-28226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Harnish D.C. Malik S. Kilbourne E. Costa R. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13621-13628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, consistent with the determinative role of HNF-4α and FoxA2 in shaping the liver- and intestine-specific gene expression program, numerous genes expressed in these tissues display this joint dependence on the two activators (13Rada-Iglesias A. Wallerman O. Koch C. Ameur A. Enroth S. Clelland G. Wester K. Wilcox S. Dovey O.M. Ellis P.D. Wraight V.L. James K. Andrews R. Langford C. Dhami P. Carter N. Vetrie D. Pontén F. Komorowski J. Dunham I. Wadelius C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3435-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, elucidating the underlying mechanisms by which each of these factors works is critical toward an understanding of tissue-specific gene expression. However, although the mechanisms by which nuclear receptors, including HNF-4α, have been extensively studied, and a fairly detailed picture of how they nucleate coactivator cascades has begun to emerge (14Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32565-32568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Barrero M.J. Malik S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 233-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the corresponding mechanisms for FoxA2 remain relatively unclear.FoxA2 and the closely related FoxA1 are members of the large family of “forkhead” factors that have been shown to regulate a wide range of genes (16Tuteja G. Kaestner K.H. Cell. 2007; 131: 192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Tuteja G. Kaestner K.H. Cell. 2007; 130: 1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Friedman J.R. Kaestner K.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2317-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The forkhead factors are characterized by the presence of a “winged-helix” DNA binding domain that shows a high degree of homology with the linker histone H5 (19Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 20Lai E. Clark K.L. Burley S.K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 10421-10423Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Consistent with this link to compacted chromatin, FoxA1 has been shown to occupy a linker histone site on the nucleosomes surrounding the transcriptional regulatory region of a target gene (21Cirillo L.A. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 961-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Furthermore, binding of FoxA1 to compacted chromatin can in fact result in a somewhat more “open” nucleosome configuration of the targeted region (22Cirillo L.A. Lin F.R. Cuesta I. Friedman D. Jarnik M. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Most recently, it has also been realized that proximity of FoxA1-binding sites is a major determinant in regulating which of its numerous target sites a given nuclear receptor (estrogen receptor) would interact (23Carroll J.S. Liu X.S. Brodsky A.S. Li W. Meyer C.A. Szary A.J. Eeckhoute J. Shao W. Hestermann E.V. Geistlinger T.R. Fox E.A. Silver P.A. Brown M. Cell. 2005; 122: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar).Taken together, and consistent with the role of forkhead proteins as “pioneer” factors in development pathways, these observations lead to a hypothetical framework for describing FoxA factor function in which a key role of the FoxA factors is to penetrate compacted chromatin, which is a hallmark of quiescent genes. Entry of other factors (which in turn recruit various coactivators) is thus predicted to be facilitated following this breach in the chromatin barrier.Although a role for additional coactivator-like factors that work with FoxA2 in the initial decompaction of chromatin in the above pathway can be envisioned, none have been described to date. As part of our ongoing effort to understand how HNF-4α activates the apoAI gene in conjunction with other factors, our strategy has been to focus on cataloguing and biochemically characterizing the relevant coactivators. Given the close association with FoxA2, and a long term view toward understanding the basis of this synergy, we have focused on identifying factors that associate with FoxA2 and potentially contribute to its transcriptional activity. Here we identify DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as a FoxA2-associating protein and demonstrate that it utilizes FoxA2 as a substrate. Furthermore, we show that phosphorylation of FoxA2 by DNA-PK modulates its transcriptional activation potential. Our results thus implicate DNA-PK as a FoxA2 cofactor.DISCUSSIONThe main conclusion from this study is that DNA-PK can interact with FoxA2 and modulate its transcription activation potential by phosphorylating a critical serine residue. Given an emerging role of the superfamily of forkhead transcription factors as pioneer factors in developmental pathways through alterations in chromatin configuration, these results have important implications for how the activity of these factors might in turn be regulated.Role for DNA-PK in TranscriptionDNA-PK appears to be a multifunctional protein. It has been most extensively characterized as a key participant in DNA repair pathways in which, intriguingly, it initiates a repair cascade by phosphorylating the variant histone H2AX (32Anderson C.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 283-314PubMed Google Scholar, 34Durocher D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 37Anderson C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). At the same time, numerous reports have implicated it directly in various aspects of transcription, including via mechanisms such as double-stranded DNA breaks that may be common to both processes. Thus, beginning with its initial identification as a kinase for the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (38Dvir A. Stein L.Y. Calore B.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10440-10447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), DNA-PK was shown to phosphorylate other components of the preinitiation complex (39Chibazakura T. Watanabe F. Kitajima S. Tsukada K. Yasukochi Y. Teraoka H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as well as to stimulate multiple rounds of transcription in in vitro transcription systems (40Woodard R.L. Anderson M.G. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). DNA-PKcs was also detected as one of the polypeptides associated with the putative nuclear receptor coactivator TRBP (41Ko L. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11471-11479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has also been implicated as a regulator of many transcriptional activators such as Sp1 (42Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and of the antitumor p53 protein, a transcriptional activator in its own right (31Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). DNA-PK was also shown to be a component of the multiprotein complex nucleated by the estrogen receptor (43Ju B.G. Lunyak V.V. Perissi V. Garcia-Bassets I. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 2006; 312: 1798-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Most recently, and perhaps of immediate relevance to this study, DNA-PK was implicated in regulating transcription factor upstream stimulatory factor-dependent expression of metabolic genes in response to feeding-induced signals (44Wong R.H. Chang I. Hudak C.S. Hyun S. Kwan H.Y. Sul H.S. Cell. 2009; 136: 1056-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus, our demonstration here that DNA-PK binds to and phosphorylates FoxA2, with significant effects on its ability to activate its target genes, highlights yet another transcription-related role of DNA-PK.Potential Mechanisms for DNA-PK Vis à Vis FoxA Factors as Pioneer FactorsOur results allow us to conclude that phosphorylation of FoxA2 by DNA-PK at Ser-283 greatly stimulates its transcriptional activation function. In contrast to what has been reported for AKT-mediated phosphorylation of FoxA2 (35Wolfrum C. Besser D. Luca E. Stoffel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11624-11629Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 36Wolfrum C. Asilmaz E. Luca E. Friedman J.M. Stoffel M. Nature. 2004; 432: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), our data suggest that the effects mediated through modification of Ser-283 are unlikely to be realized from control of subcellular localization of FoxA2. Furthermore, although we have not yet analyzed effects of the modification on interactions with chromatin (see below), our comparative analysis of the specific DNA binding ability of wild-type FoxA2 and FoxA2 bearing a mutation in the DNA-PK phosphorylation site (on which our conclusions regarding the functional consequences of the modification are based) suggests that the mutation does not have any gross effects on the ability of FoxA2 to bind to its target site. Thus the evidence presented here is most consistent with the notion that a main functional consequence of this modification is realized at a step following the recruitment of FoxA2 to its target genes.Recent mechanistic dissection of how forkhead factors exert their transcriptional activation functions has focused on their ability to bind higher order chromatin and render it more amenable for additional transcriptional factors to bind in the immediate vicinity (22Cirillo L.A. Lin F.R. Cuesta I. Friedman D. Jarnik M. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 23Carroll J.S. Liu X.S. Brodsky A.S. Li W. Meyer C.A. Szary A.J. Eeckhoute J. Shao W. Hestermann E.V. Geistlinger T.R. Fox E.A. Silver P.A. Brown M. Cell. 2005; 122: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). As attractive as this idea is with respect to the function of forkhead factors as pioneer factors and the similarity of their DNA binding domains to linker histones, it remains likely that these factors also function as conventional transcriptional activators that act in part by recruiting additional coactivators. Indeed, forkhead factors have long been known to contain autonomous “activation domains” (18Friedman J.R. Kaestner K.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2317-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) that function independently of the winged-helix DNA binding domain. Thus, these transcription factors can reasonably be expected to act at multiple levels.Therefore, a most straightforward mechanism that can be envisioned on the basis of our data is that DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of FoxA2 facilitates interactions of downstream factors necessary for full activation. In the simplest case these could include factors responsible for chromatin transactions or interactions with the general transcription machinery. More intriguingly, as is emerging for several other transcriptional factors (45Lipford J.R. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 46Collins G.A. Tansey W.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 47Wu R.C. Feng Q. Lonard D.M. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2007; 129: 1125-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), it may be that efficient activation by FoxA2 is coupled to proteasome-dependent degradation, which serves to “reset” the transcription complex at each round of transcription to maintain elevated expression levels. Phosphorylation by DNA-PK could contribute to the turnover, and apparent coactivation effects, by marking FoxA2 for degradation. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that steady-state intracellular concentrations of FoxA2(T280A,S283A), which could not be phosphorylated, were consistently found to build up to significantly higher levels as compared with wild-type FoxA2 (data not shown). Also potentially consistent with the relatively fleeting lifetime of wild-type FoxA2 is the observation that mass spectrometry analyses failed to detect FoxA2 species bearing this modification. Regardless of the precise downstream mechanism, phosphorylation induced by DNA-PK would initiate a cascade of events that culminate in the efficient establishment and activity of the preinitiation complex, the hallmark of an active gene.Unexpectedly for a coactivator, our ChIP data indicate that DNA-PK (Ku70) is distributed across the entire apoAI gene albeit at low levels. This could imply that FoxA2 encounters DNA-PK, a chromatin-associated protein upon interaction with its cognate sites within chromatin. Based on the above discussion, and although this is not simply a passive interaction, important functional outcomes could nevertheless ensue at the local sites of interaction. Alternatively, given the recent report that DNA-PK recruitment to upstream stimulatory factor is dependent on extracellular signals (insulin) (44Wong R.H. Chang I. Hudak C.S. Hyun S. Kwan H.Y. Sul H.S. Cell. 2009; 136: 1056-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), its full mobilization to the apoAI promoter may also be dependent on some as-yet-unidentified signal. It also remains unclear as to what role, if any, the Ku70 and Ku80 subunits, which in the context of DNA repair are the primary determinants in guiding DNA-PK to the various lesions (48Downs J.A. Jackson S.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), play in the context of transcription.Indeed, it cannot be ruled out that FoxA2 interaction with DNA-PK is additionally a means to deliver the latter to the transcription machinery as a conventional coactivator. The linker histone H1 has been identified previously as a substrate for DNA-PK (49Kysela B. Chovanec M. Jeggo P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 1877-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and further that phosphorylation of linker histones has been linked to gene activation (50Dou Y. Song X. Liu Y. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3914-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 51Koop R. Di Croce L. Beato M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 588-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, DNA-PK, recruited by FoxA2, could also potentially contribute in this context by phosphorylating the linker histone H1 in tandem with its effects on FoxA2. In the end, although FoxA2 binding to H1-compacted chromatin, per se, might reflect a substantial local relief of compaction, additional unfolding may depend on DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation of H1. How the phosphorylation at Ser-283 would tie in with this mode is not immediately apparent, but scenarios can be imagined in which this modification is coupled to interactions with the remodeled chromatin. In this regard, it is interesting to note that whereas the winged helix domain of FoxA2 serves as the main docking site for DNA-PK, Ser-283 is located somewhat distally in the C-terminal region of the molecule suggesting a physical basis for such a coupled mechanism.Ongoing studies, which include establishing an in vitro transcription system for FoxA2, along the lines that we have previously implemented for HNF-4α (15Barrero M.J. Malik S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 233-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Malik S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 364: 257-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), will allow us to test the effects of DNA-PK on FoxA2 whether as a bona fide coactivator or, more generally, as a cofactor. Transcriptional control of mRNA genes is achieved through multiprotein complexes that are targeted to promoter and enhancer regions of these genes by regulatory factors that recognize specific DNA sequences. Typically, several such factors, or transcriptional activators, each respond to a particular signal but act together in a synergistic fashion to control the expression of the target gene. Thus, the unique temporal and spatial expression program of a given gene is hard-wired into the regulatory sequences contained within its enhancer and promoter regions (1Brivanlou A.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 2002; 295: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 2Roeder R.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activators recruit different classes of coactivators, which function broadly on at least two levels (3Roeder R.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 201-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 4Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some coactivators function at the earliest stage of gene activation by acting on the chromatin template to make it more amenable to the action of factors that enter later in the process. Many of these coactivators possess enzymatic activities whose effects range from ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling to covalent modifications of histones that include acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitylation (2Roeder R.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 5Lemon B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2551-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The role of the other class of coactivators, exemplified by the Mediator complex (6Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 256-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), is to nucleate the preinitiation complex, the RNA polymerase II-containing multiprotein entity that is ultimately responsible for the actual RNA synthesis (7Malik S.

Commun. 1997; 236: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and hyaluronidase 2 (HYAL2) (11.Lepperdinger G. Müllegger J. Kreil G. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) exhibit highest activities at acidic conditions, whereas the hyaluronidase found in Xenopus laevis kidney is only active at neutral pH (12.Reitinger S. Müllegger J. Lepperdinger G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Bee venom hyaluronidase (13.Reitinger S. Boroviak T. Laschober G.T. Fehrer C. Müllegger J. Lindner H. Lepperdinger G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2008; 57: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), as well as sperm hyaluronidase, PH20 (SPAM1) (14.Gmachl M. Sagan S. Ketter S. Kreil G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), are capable of degrading HA over a broad pH range. Up to three PH20 isoforms with greatly different pH optima could be found in protein preparations from bovine testis (15.Oettl M. Hoechstetter J. Asen I. Bernhardt G. Buschauer A. Eur. J. Pharm Sci. 2003; 18: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Extensive analysis of hyaluronidase structures did not bring forward any insights as to what residues or regions of the enzymes specify a specific pH optimum. Profiles of pH-dependent activities can be assigned by computing the electrostatic interactions of the enzyme, which are primarily determined by the ionization states of its amino acid side chains. The pKa values of titratable groups of the enzyme reflect pH-dependent properties such as stability, enzymatic interaction, and substrate interactions (16.Nielsen J.E. J. Mol. Graph Model. 2007; 25: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here we present computational and experimental data on the replacement of a loop region located at the end of the substrate binding groove yielding a variant hyaluronidase with an altered pH profile. Tertiary structure models were generated (17.Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6071) Google Scholar) with Deep View/Swiss-Pdb Viewer version 3.7 (18.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar) using the three-dimensional coordinates of bee hyaluronidase (Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession 1fcv) and HYAL1. (PDB accession 2pe4). Images were generated with the aid of the open source PyMOL 0.99rc6 (19.DeLano W. PyMOL Release 0.99. DeLano Scientific LLC, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). Coding regions of wild-type (accession number NM_007312) and mutated HYAL1 were inserted into the plasmid pT7TS (P. A. Krieg, University of Arizona) using restriction sites EcoRV and BcuI, respectively. Four-primer PCR technology was applied to substitute the native amino acid sequence between cysteine residues at positions 207 and 221. Flanking primers together with the primer pair 5′-TGGGCAGGAGCCACTACCGCAGTCAGGGAAGCC-3′ and 5′-GACTGCGGTAGTGGCTCCTGCCCATCAGGCATC-3 were used to replace the original loop by the sequence of the 4 amino acid residues, glycine serine glycine serine, resulting in a cDNA encoding HYAL1ΔL. Frog surgery, oocyte preparation, and cRNA injection was accomplished as described previously (20.Reitinger S. Laschober G.T. Fehrer C. Greiderer B. Lepperdinger G. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The coding regions of HYAL1 and HYAL1ΔL in pT7TS vector linearized with BamHI were transcribed in vitro. 50 ng of capped cRNA were injected into freshly prepared oocytes. The cells were kept in culture medium O-R2 containing antibiotics at 16 °C for 2 days. Homogenized Xenopus oocytes were mixed with SDS-loading buffer (315 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (w/v) SDS, 25% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) and separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel prior to semidry blotting onto nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Whatman). Hyaluronidase was detected using specific antibody raised in rabbits as described previously (13.Reitinger S. Boroviak T. Laschober G.T. Fehrer C. Müllegger J. Lindner H. Lepperdinger G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2008; 57: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Titration curves for all titratable groups were calculated using the WHAT IF pKa calculation package, as described previously (21.Nielsen J.E. Vriend G. Proteins. 2001; 43: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), except using a single uniform protein dielectric constant of 8. Calculations for HYAL1 and HYAL1ΔL are available (using the pKD program available from the Protein Analysis and Design Group, with accession numbers 2pe4_apo.pka.pdb and hyal_deltaL_apo.pka.pdb). Titration curves and pKa values were analyzed with pKaTool (16.Nielsen J.E. J. Mol. Graph Model. 2007; 25: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Electrostatic potential maps at pH 3.8 and pH 5.5 were calculated by linearly scaling the optimized potentials for liquid simulations (OPLS) charges (22.Jorgensen W.L. Tirado-Rives J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar) for each titratable group by the fractional degree of protonation of that group at the desired pH value, which were directly derived from the titration curves calculated in the pKa calculations. The hydrogen bond network in each structure was optimized as described previously (23.Nielsen J.E. Andersen K.V. Honig B. Hooft R.W. Klebe G. Vriend G. Wade R.C. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and the electrostatic potential was solved using DelPhi 2 (24.Nicholls A. Honig B. J. Comput. Chem. 1991; 12: 435-445Crossref Scopus (1171) Google Scholar) using a 65-cubed grid, a protein dielectric constant of 8, a solvent dielectric of 80, an ionic strength of 0.144 m, and an ion exclusion layer of 2.0 Å. Electrostatic potential maps were visualized using PyMOL (19.DeLano W. PyMOL Release 0.99. DeLano Scientific LLC, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). After cRNA injection and culture, healthy oocytes were pooled and homogenized prior to enzymatic analysis. As described previously (12.Reitinger S. Müllegger J. Lepperdinger G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25.Müllegger J. Reitinger S. Lepperdinger G. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the amount of lysate and the time of hydrolysis were titrated to specify the protein amount and assay duration, at which cleavage rates were in the linear range appropriate for subsequent comparative analyses of the respective pH profiles. Hydrolysis rates were quantified by determining the relative median length along with the amount of the remaining hyaluronan applying histogrammatic characterization of the digitized blots using ImageJ (NIH). A paired, two-tailed Student's t test was applied for statistical evaluation. HYAL1 was initially expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed recombinant protein was exclusively found as an insoluble protein aggregate, and no enzymatic activity could be obtained following solubilization and refolding. After separation by SDS-PAGE, recombinant HYAL1 was used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits, which were applicable for Western analysis. Bee hyaluronidase has been co-crystallized in the presence of HA tetrasaccharides (PDB accession code: 1fcv) (7.Marković-Housley Z. Miglierini G. Soldatova L. Rizkallah P.J. Müller U. Schirmer T. Structure. 2000; 8: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Due to the polymeric structure of HA, substrate binding is mediated alongside one-half of the globular protein, opposite to the side where the N and C termini are located. In HYAL1, across from the active center and located at the end of the substrate binding groove, a loop, which is positioned between 2 cysteine residues at positions 207 and 221, leads to a tapering geometry thereof. Hence, we altered the native sequence between the two cysteines both in silico (Fig. 1) as well as in reality (Table 1) by replacing it either with one of the respective sequences of the bee venom (HYAL1Δbeeh) or with that of the testicular (human PH20) hyaluronidase (HYAL1ΔPH20) or by mutating the potential N-glycosylation site at position 218 from a threonine to an alanine HYAL1Δglyc. Employing a protein structure modeling approach, this loop region may be replaced without distorting the structural conformation of the enzyme by the shortest possible stretch of 4 amino acids. In the model, the sequence glycine-serine-glycine-serine (GSGS) was introduced, and the resulting protein model was termed HYAL1ΔL (Fig. 1). The latter could be also expressed as an active enzyme.TABLE 1Sequence and activity information on HYAL1 variantsLoop sequenceRelative activitypH 4.5pH 5.5HYAL1WTCYNYDFLSPNYTGQC++++−HYAL1ΔglycCYNYDFLSPNYAGQC+++−HYAL1ΔPH20CYNHHYKKPGYNGSC++−HYAL1ΔbeehCYNLTPNQPS–AQCNDNDHYAL1ΔLC—-GSGS—–C++++ Open table in a new tab In previous analyses, we showed that highly active hyaluronidase can be reliably expressed by injection of cRNA into X. laevis oocytes (12.Reitinger S. Müllegger J. Lepperdinger G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 20.Reitinger S. Laschober G.T. Fehrer C. Greiderer B. Lepperdinger G. Biochem.

Here we continued to employ this method to express a variety of HYAL1 variants. The activity of the variants was first examined at pH 4.5 and pH 5.5, the former being optimal, the latter being inhibitory for wild-type HYAL1. Apart from HYAL1Δbeeh, all variant forms were active at pH 4.5. Only HYAL1ΔL hydrolyzed hyaluronan at pH 5.5, albeit at a decreased rate (Table 1). Next, cell lysates containing equal amounts of wild-type HYAL1 or HYAL1ΔL protein (Fig. 2) were analyzed side-by-side, and the enzyme activity was assessed at a wide range of different pH values. Both HYAL1 and HYAL1ΔL efficiently degraded HA at pH values around 4. As reported earlier, HYAL1 is inactive above pH 5.1, whereas HYAL1ΔL exhibited activity up to pH 5.9 (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Hyaluronidase activity. Homogenized cell lysates containing wild-type HYAL1 (WT), variant HYAL1ΔL (ΔL), or mock (m) were incubated with hapten-labeled hyaluronan in citric-phosphate buffer at the indicated pH (bottom line). Reactions were electrophoretically separated and blotted onto a nylon membrane and immunochemically detected. A, representative example of activity assessment at specified pH.

C, cumulative evaluation of four independent activity measurements at increasing pH values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The mutated region neither appears to be part of the active center, nor is it conceivable that direct interactions with residues of the active center do occur. To corroborate this assumption, we calculated pKa values for all residues and analyzed the titration curves of the two carboxyl groups of the active site amino acids, aspartate (Asp-129) and glutamate (Glu-131). The active site pKa values appeared relatively insensitive to the deletion. In HYAL1, the pKa value of Asp-129 is 6.1, and that of Glu-131 is 9.4. Similarly, the respective values in HYAL1ΔL are 6.3 and 9.5. The calculated pKa values are in good agreement with the observed pH activity profiles of both enzymes, although the magnitude of the pH shift for HYAL1ΔL is not accurately captured by these calculations. Because the deletion is a substantial modification, it is possible that structural relaxation, which is neglected in the HYAL1ΔL model, causes minor conformational rearrangements at the active site that further alters the pKa values of Asp-129 and Glu-131. The mutated loop is demarcating the substrate binding crevice at one of its ends. Appropriate binding of HA, in particular the site-specific positioning of the N-acetyl group at the active center, is pivotal for efficient hydrolysis of the polymer. Hence not only steric hindrance, but also a modified intermolecular binding capacity, may contribute to the observed change in the pH activity profile of the enzyme. We therefore calculated the surface electrostatic potential for HYAL1 and HYAL1ΔL at pH 3.8 and pH 5.5 using calculated pKa values (electrostatic potential, data not shown) (21.Nielsen J.E. Vriend G. Proteins. 2001; 43: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 27.Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). HYAL1ΔL exhibited a more positive surface electrostatic potential at pH 5.5 than wild-type HYAL1. Thus, besides the protonation states of the active site residues, HA association and dissociation may be rate-limiting for HYAL1 activity. Not only does the absence of the loop in HYAL1ΔL make it conceivable that the binding crevice is rendered more accessible to the HA polymer (Fig. 1), but also, changes in the electrostatic potential maps suggest that the pKa values in HYAL1ΔL, which govern substrate binding and product release, are altered. Insect hyaluronidases fold into a single domain. This supports the notion that the homologous part of other hyaluronidases is also sufficient for HA hydrolysis. Specific properties of mammalian-type hyaluronidases such as their pH optima may, however, be effectively influenced by the C-terminal extensions. Vertebrate enzymes come in various isoforms, most likely resulting from posttranslational proteolytic cleavage(s). For instance, mature hyaluronidases can be liberated from their glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored state by proteolysis close to the C terminus. In some cases, this first processing is followed by a second proteolytic cleavage. In the case of HYAL1, both processing steps occur. A 57-kDa form is the only isoform found in plasma; besides the 57-kDa form, also a 45-kDa form is found in urine (28.Csóka A.B. Frost G.I. Wong T. Stern R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A soluble form of PH20 is also well documented (29.Cherr G.N. Meyers S.A. Yudin A.I. VandeVoort C.A. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. Overstreet J.W. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 30.Meyer M.F. Kreil G. Aschauer H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The processed 53-kDa form has a pH optimum of 4.0, whereas the unprocessed form is most active at neutral pH (15.Oettl M. Hoechstetter J. Asen I. Bernhardt G. Buschauer A. Eur. J. Pharm Sci. 2003; 18: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The conformational differences at the active center and variations regarding substrate positioning to achieve such differences have not been investigated. Performing (site-directed) mutagenesis and recombinant expression in Xenopus oocytes, we studied the serum enzyme, HYAL1, which as shown by others previously is only active at pH values below 5.1 (10.Frost G.I. Csóka A.B. Wong T. Stern R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 31.Podyma K.A. Yamagata S. Sakata K. Yamagata T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 32.Natowicz M.R. Wang Y. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1996; 245: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Glutamate at position 131 is the proton donor in the proposed catalytic mechanism for hyaluronidases (7.Marković-Housley Z. Miglierini G. Soldatova L. Rizkallah P.J. Müller U. Schirmer T. Structure. 2000; 8: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), but Glu-131 is unlikely to be able to donate a proton to the substrate without Asp-129 being protonated. The lowest pKa value in the pair Asp-129 and Glu-131 will therefore govern the pH activity profile of the enzyme. Experimental data on the catalytically competent protonation state in xylanase variant Bcx N35D (family 11 glycosidases) supports the conclusion that only the doubly protonated state is catalytically active (33.Joshi M.D. Sidhu G. Nielsen J.E. Brayer G.D. Withers S.G. McIntosh L.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10115-10139Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 34.Søndergaard C.R. McIntosh L.P. Pollastri G. Nielsen J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 376: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Many residues in the proximity of the active site are conserved within hyaluronidases. In most cases, mutation at these positions rendered HYAL1 inactive, presumably due to steric hindrance and/or incorrect folding. 4S. Reitinger, J. Müllegger, B. Greiderer, and G. Lepperdinger, unpublished results. Because HA is a charged polymer, the pH dependence for substrate association as well as product dissociation must not be neglected. To change the gross geometry of the binding cleft, we mutated the bulky epitope at the tapering end of the binding cleft, which folds up between cysteine residues 207 and 221 and contains 13 amino acids. Mutation of the potential glycosylation site (T218A) within the loop region did not greatly alter the activity of the enzyme with respect to pH. Similar results were obtained when the stretch between the two cysteines was replaced with the interjacent sequence of PH20/SPAM1, a hyaluronidase that also exhibits activity at neutral pH. In addition to being exactly 13 amino acids long, it also bears four positive charges (His-210, His-211; Lys-214, Lys-215) when compared with one negative charge (Asp-211) present in the HYAL1 loop. It is therefore conceivable that due to stronger ionic interactions with the hyaluronan polymer at positions a long way off from the active center, substrate binding at elevated pH may actually be enforced. Although active at pH 4.5, HYAL1ΔPH20 was found inactive at pH values above 5. Another family member of the mammalian-type hyaluronidases, which exhibits a broad pH profile still being active at neutral pH, is the enzyme secreted into bee venom (13.Reitinger S. Boroviak T. Laschober G.T. Fehrer C. Müllegger J. Lindner H. Lepperdinger G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2008; 57: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Its loop sequence is by 2 amino acid moieties shorter and actually contains no charged residues. Unexpectedly, this variant, although exhibiting some activity at pH 3.8, turned out to be inactive at pH 4.5, demonstrating that the mutated region either appears to be essential for direct substrate binding or is involved in proper positioning of the polymer with respect to the catalytic center. We next applied computer-assisted protein modeling to design a GSGS-interposed variant that displays a greatly enlarged binding crevice. This variant was found active, and in addition, it also processed HA at elevated pH. We therefore conclude that raising pH does not induce major conformational or chemical changes at the active center of HYAL1ΔL, and HA can still be sufficiently bound and properly positioned there to be efficiently hydrolyzed. By performing pKa calculations, we were able to qualitatively predict the upshift in the pH activity profile but only inadequately able to predict the magnitude of the pH change. It is likely that the deletion in HYAL1ΔL causes minor structural relaxation that affects the packing around Asp-129 and Glu-131, thus causing the pKa values of these residues to shift even more than computed. Because structural rearrangements are not accurately comprehended by homology modeling methods, we cannot take these into account in the pKa calculations. However, it is well documented that even small changes in protein structures can lead to large changes in pKa value calculations (16.Nielsen J.E. J. Mol. Graph Model. 2007; 25: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 35.Nielsen J.E. McCammon J.A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It is furthermore possible that interactions between the protein and the glycan side chains are affected by secondary sites, which induce long range effects on substrate accommodation at the active site. Peter Lackner (University of Salzburg) is acknowledged for assistance in computational protein modeling."

https://openalex.org/W2056459435,"Science authors laboring under the oppressive yoke of refereeing should think back to the time when Galileo Galilei brought his manuscript to printer Baglioni in Venice at the end of February 1610. The referee for his Sidereus Nuncius —a short treatise based on his first observations made through a telescope—was to be the office of the Holy Inquisition. Galileo knew that those referees didn't simply reject what they didn't like: They might invite you in for a few questions. But that time he was in luck. On 1 March, the Venice Council, on advice of the local Inquisitor, gave its consent.

Few know that Galileo (and Baglioni) then took an astonishing risk. Such was his passion for his new telescope that Galileo added observations and comments dated up to 2 March—materials that the Inquisitor could not possibly have seen. But those last few additions are so beautiful. For the first time since 7 January, when Galileo had started observing Jupiter, a “fixed” star had entered the small field of view of his instrument. As he kept pointing to the planet and its twirling satellites, the star appeared to move steadily across, as apparent in his sketches dated 27 February to 2 March.This provided conclusive proof that Jupiter carried these satellites (moons) in its motion against the background sky: a finding that would have definitely risked the Inquisitor's wrath.

By this time, Galileo must have been really busy—finalizing text, checking proofs and figures, a real headache these, especially the famous Moon plates from his earlier 1609 observations. Half-tones had to be hand-etched in wood by one of Baglioni's artists, who had Galileo's beautiful water colors in front of him. Probably hard-pressed, the etcher made a poor job of it. Luckily, however, the originals have survived, revealing the gifted hand of a true son of the Florentine renaissance. They can be admired, along with countless other galileiana, in Florence at the Palazzo Strozzi Exhibition ([ 1 ][1]).

By 13 March 1610, 550 copies of the Sidereus Nuncius were ready to document a brave new era, that of astronomy with a telescope. Bigger and better telescopes were soon invented by Isaac Newton (born 1642, the year of Galileo's death), Gian Domenico Cassini (1625 to 1712), and innumerable others to follow, giving mankind an ever-growing universe: from solar system to stars, from stars to our Galaxy, and from there to an expanding universe full of as many galaxies as there are stars in our own, about 100 billion.

In the past 400 years, telescopes have also evolved the capacity to tell us what stars are made of, allowing us to learn that our own bodies (and all we see) have been made by stars. True, the ignition of the first stars in the universe, about 13 billion years ago, has not yet been recorded, but we are working on it. The European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) ([ 2 ][3]), for example, should do the job. With its mirror diameter exceeding 40 m (compare with the 4-cm Galileo lens), the E-ELT will be close to the extreme of what we are currently able to realize and afford for observations at optical wavelengths. But astronomers are also planning a Square Kilometre Array of radio telescopes ([ 3 ][4]), the ultimate challenge in astronomy with radio waves. These large, steerable antenna dishes have detected, for example, radio pulsars, stars that pack the mass of our Sun in a wildly rotating 10-km sphere.

Over the past 40 years, we have been putting telescopes in space for an “astronomy of the invisible” that would have challenged Galileo's comprehension. It's hard to describe as telescopes the Geiger-counter–based contraptions that Riccardo Giacconi and colleagues put in a rocket nose in 1962. Yet, they gave us a glimpse of our first cosmic x-ray sources. Today's state-of-the art orbiting x-ray telescopes have huge photon-focusing optics and will soon log half-a-million x-ray sources in the sky. Among these sources are accreting black holes, objects with exotic physics.

Ten years after x-ray astronomy, gamma-ray astronomy was born. Gamma-ray photons are impossible to focus, so it's much harder to build effective gamma-ray telescopes. Still, mostly thanks to the recently launched Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope ([ 4 ][5]), thousands of gamma-ray sources in the sky will be pin-pointed. Some of them, such as Geminga-like neutron stars, are only “visible” in the gamma-ray region of the spectrum. So, too, are the 5000 mysterious “gamma-ray bursts.” Because these bursts are fantastically energetic, cosmological one-time events, special telescopes have had to be invented.

Even more discoveries have come from telescopes in space: numerous infrared and ultraviolet stars and galaxies, many observed by the Hubble Space Telescope ([ 5 ][6])—the most productive astronomy machine ever. Yet another telescope in space imaged the baby universe when it was only 300,000 to 400,000 years old and just twice the size of our Galaxy. At that age, it is visible only at microwave wavelengths, expansion-cooled from Big-Bang temperatures. Those cosmological photons carry, imprinted in their tiny fluctuations, the whole of today's universe.

What telescopes can we expect for the future? Galileo and Newton would go for the unknown. The still truly unknown in the universe is its nonelectromagnetic content—neutrinos and gravitational waves. We know that gravitational waves exist, and we know the theory behind a telescope for catching them, but we've yet to detect them with the likes of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. In contrast, neutrinos have been observed, both from our Sun and from a local supernova, using underground detectors as our telescopes.

Neutrino astronomers are, I believe, on the brink of important discoveries. Some now use Earth as a detector, including its Antarctic ice (the IceCube project) or ocean water (the ANTARES project) ([ 6 ][7], [ 7 ][8]). It is difficult to imagine a bigger telescope, yet it matches the elusiveness of its target. These telescopes—like the E-ELT, the Square Kilometre Array, and the future space telescopes—are worthy descendants of Galileo's specillum , and still look at the same sky.
