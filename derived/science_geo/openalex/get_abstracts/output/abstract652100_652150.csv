https://openalex.org/W3014271510,"We identified seasonal human coronaviruses, influenza viruses and rhinoviruses in exhaled breath and coughs of children and adults with acute respiratory illness. Surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of influenza virus RNA in respiratory droplets and coronavirus RNA in aerosols, with a trend toward reduced detection of coronavirus RNA in respiratory droplets. Our results indicate that surgical face masks could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals. A study of 246 individuals with seasonal respiratory virus infections randomized to wear or not wear a surgical face mask showed that masks can significantly reduce detection of coronavirus and influenza virus in exhaled breath and may help interrupt virus transmission."

Taking advantage of existing longitudinal health care and research patient cohorts, Drew et al. pushed software updates to participants to encourage reporting of potential coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms. The authors recruited about 2 million users (including health care workers) to the COVID Symptom Study (previously known as the COVID Symptom Tracker) from across the United Kingdom and the United States. The prevalence of combinations of symptoms (three or more), including fatigue and cough, followed by diarrhea, fever, and/or anosmia, was predictive of a positive test verification for SARS-CoV-2. As exemplified by data from Wales, United Kingdom, mathematical modeling predicted geographical hotspots of incidence 5 to 7 days in advance of official public health reports.

https://openalex.org/W3021801979,"This paper presents the potential of applying physics-informed neural networks for solving nonlinear multiphysics problems, which are essential to many fields such as biomedical engineering, earthquake prediction, and underground energy harvesting. Specifically, we investigate how to extend the methodology of physics-informed neural networks to solve both the forward and inverse problems in relation to the nonlinear diffusivity and Biot's equations. We explore the accuracy of the physics-informed neural networks with different training example sizes and choices of hyperparameters. The impacts of the stochastic variations between various training realizations are also investigated. In the inverse case, we also study the effects of noisy measurements. Furthermore, we address the challenge of selecting the hyperparameters of the inverse model and illustrate how this challenge is linked to the hyperparameters selection performed for the forward one."
https://openalex.org/W3022645129,"Over the past two decades, measurements of carbon nanotube toxicity and biodistribution have yielded a wide range of results. Properties such as nanotube type (single-walled vs. multi-walled), purity, length, aggregation state, and functionalization, as well as route of administration, greatly affect both the biocompatibility and biodistribution of carbon nanotubes. These differences suggest that generalizable conclusions may be elusive and that studies must be material- and application-specific. Here, we assess the short- and long-term biodistribution and biocompatibility of a single-chirality DNA-encapsulated single-walled carbon nanotube complex upon intravenous administration that was previously shown to function as an in-vivo reporter of endolysosomal lipid accumulation. Regarding biodistribution and fate, we found bulk specificity to the liver and >90% signal attenuation by 14 days in mice. Using near-infrared hyperspectral microscopy to measure single nanotubes, we found low-level, long-term persistence in organs such as the heart, liver, lung, kidney, and spleen. Measurements of histology, animal weight, complete blood count; biomarkers of organ function all suggest short- and long-term biocompatibility. This work suggests that carbon nanotubes can be used as preclinical research tools in-vivo without affecting acute or long-term health."
https://openalex.org/W3021043347,"Significant population declines in Acropora cervicornis and A. palmata began in the 1970s and now exceed over 90%. The losses were caused by a combination of coral disease and bleaching, with possible contributions from other stressors, including pollution and predation. Reproduction in the wild by fragment regeneration and sexual recruitment is inadequate to offset population declines. Starting in 2007, the Coral Restoration Foundation™ evaluated the feasibility of outplanting A. cervicornis colonies to reefs in the Florida Keys to restore populations at sites where the species was previously abundant. Reported here are the results of 20 coral outplanting projects with each project defined as a cohort of colonies outplanted at the same time and location. Photogrammetric analysis and in situ monitoring (2007 to 2015) measured survivorship, growth, and condition of 2419 colonies. Survivorship was initially high but generally decreased after two years. Survivorship among projects based on colony counts ranged from 4% to 89% for seven cohorts monitored at least five years. Weibull survival models were used to estimate survivorship beyond the duration of the projects and ranged from approximately 0% to over 35% after five years and 0% to 10% after seven years. Growth rate averaged 10 cm/year during the first two years then plateaued in subsequent years. After four years, approximately one-third of surviving colonies were ≥ 50 cm in maximum diameter. Projects used three to sixteen different genotypes and significant differences did not occur in survivorship, condition, or growth. Restoration times for three reefs were calculated based on NOAA Recovery Plan (NRP) metrics (colony abundance and size) and the findings from projects reported here. Results support NRP conclusions that reducing stressors is required before significant population growth and recovery will occur. Until then, outplanting protects against local extinction and helps to maintain genetic diversity in the wild."
https://openalex.org/W3021125337,"Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis is largely responsible for HCC-associated recurrence and mortality. We aimed to identify metastasis-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to understand the molecular mechanism of HCC metastasis. We first identified that miR-1258 was downregulated in HCC tissues both in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) dataset. MiR-1258 expression negatively correlated with recurrence-free survival and overall survival of HCC patients. MiR-1258 overexpression inhibited migration and invasion of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo, whereas miR-1258 downregulation promoted cell metastasis. Luciferase assays verified direct binding of miR-1258 to Smad2 and Smad3, thereby attenuating TGF-β/Smad signaling. We further established that lncRNA LINC01278 was a negative regulator of miR-1258. In vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that LINC01278-mediated HCC metastasis was dependent on miR-1258 expression. Furthermore, miR-1258 downregulation in turn increased LINC01278 expression. We also observed that TCF-4 could bind to the LINC01278 promoter site. In addition, LINC01278 downregulation decreased migration and invasion of HCC cells induced by β-catenin and TGF-β1 both in vitro and in vivo. We uncovered a novel mechanism for β-catenin/TCF-4-LINC01278-miR-1258-Smad2/3 feedback loop activation in HCC metastasis, and the study indicated that LINC01278 could serve as a therapeutic target for HCC metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3021305296,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a leading cause of cancer death globally. More accurate and reliable diagnostic methods/biomarkers are urgently needed. Joint application of metabolomics and transcriptomics technologies possesses the high efficiency of identifying key metabolic pathways and functional genes in lung cancer patients. In this study, we performed an untargeted metabolomics analysis of 142 NSCLC patients and 159 healthy controls; 35 identified metabolites were significantly different between NSCLC patients and healthy controls, of which 6 metabolites (hypoxanthine, inosine, L-tryptophan, indoleacrylic acid, acyl-carnitine C10:1, and lysoPC(18:2)) were chosen as combinational potential biomarkers for NSCLC. The area under the curve (AUC) value, sensitivity (SE), and specificity (SP) of these six biomarkers were 0.99, 0.98, and 0.99, respectively. Potential diagnostic implications of the metabolic characteristics in NSCLC was studied. The metabolomics results were further verified by transcriptomics analysis of 1027 NSCLC patients and 108 adjacent peritumoral tissues from TCGA database. This analysis identified 2202 genes with significantly different expressions in cancer cells compared to normal controls, which in turn defined pathways implicated in the metabolism of the compounds revealed by metabolomics analysis. We built a fully connected network of metabolites and genes, which shows a good correspondence between the transcriptome analysis and the metabolites selected for diagnosis. In conclusion, this work provides evidence that the metabolic biomarkers identified may be used for NSCLC diagnosis and screening. Comprehensive analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics data offered a validated and comprehensive understanding of metabolism in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W3022198454,"Background Depression is highly prevalent among patients newly starting antiretroviral treatment (ART) in Malawi and many other countries. Untreated depression at ART initiation can disrupt the HIV care continuum. Effective approaches for depression screening and treatment exist for low-resource settings, but they are rarely applied. Identifying effective implementation strategies are critical. Methods A pilot program integrated depression screening and treatment into routine HIV care using existing staff at two public health clinics in Malawi in two phases; a screening-only “control” phase and an active “intervention” phase. During the intervention phase, providers prescribed antidepressants or referred patients for Friendship Bench problem-solving therapy. We evaluated the program’s impact on retention in HIV care, viral suppression, and depression remission at 6 months using tabular comparisons and log-binomial models to estimate adjusted risk ratios and mean differences among the intervention group relative to the control group. Results Nearly all consenting participants were screened for depression appropriately and 25% had mild to severe depressive symptoms. During the intervention phase, 86% of participants with mild depressive symptoms started Friendship Bench therapy and 96% of participants with moderate to severe depressive symptoms started antidepressants. Few participants in the intervention group received consistent depression treatment over their first 6 months in care. In the adjusted main analysis, program exposure did not demonstrably affect most HIV or mental health outcomes, though the probability of currently being on ART at 6 months was significantly lower among the intervention group than the control group [RR 0.6(95%CI: 0.4–0.9)]. Conclusions While it is feasible to integrate depression screening and treatment initiation into ART initiation, providing ongoing depression treatment over time is challenging. Similar implementation science studies focused on maintaining depression management will be increasingly important as we strive to understand and test the best ways to implement evidence-based depression treatment within HIV care."
https://openalex.org/W3023297023,"Background Metastatic breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women, but the genomics of metastasis in breast cancer are poorly studied. Methods We explored a set of 11,616 breast tumors, including 5,034 metastases, which had undergone targeted sequencing during standard clinical care. Results Besides the known hotspot mutations in ESR1, we observed a metastatic enrichment of previously unreported, lower-prevalence mutations in the ligand-binding domain, implying that these mutations may also be functional. Furthermore, individual ESR1 hotspots are significantly enriched in specific metastatic tissues and histologies, suggesting functional differences between these mutations. Other alterations enriched across all metastases include loss of function of the CDK4 regulator CDKN1B, and mutations in the transcription factor CTCF. Mutations enriched at specific metastatic sites generally reflect biology of the target tissue and may be adaptations to growth in the local environment. These include PTEN and ASXL1 alterations in brain metastases and NOTCH1 alterations in skin. We observed an enrichment of KRAS, KEAP1, STK11 and EGFR mutations in lung metastases. However, the patterns of other mutations in these tumors indicate that these are misdiagnosed lung primaries rather than breast metastases. Conclusions An order-of-magnitude increase in samples relative to previous studies allowed us to detect novel genomic characteristics of metastatic cancer and to expand and clarify previous findings."
https://openalex.org/W3021562669,"DNA damage in the A549 human lung cancer cell line treated with cold plasma irradiation was investigated. We confirmed that cold atmospheric plasma generated reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) in a liquid, and the intracellular RONS level was increased in plasma-irradiated cells. However, a notable decrease in cell viability was not observed 24 hours after plasma irradiation. Because RONS induce oxidative damage in cells, strand breaks and chemical modification of DNA in the cancer cells were investigated. We found that 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) formation as well as DNA strand breaks, which have been thoroughly investigated, were induced by plasma irradiation. In addition, up-regulation of 8-oxoG repair enzyme was observed after plasma irradiation."

https://openalex.org/W3021832801,"The metal hyperaccumulator Azolla filiculoides is accompanied by a microbiome potentially supporting plant during exposition to heavy metals. We hypothesized that the microbiome exposition to selected heavy metals will reveal metal tolerant strains. We used Next Generation Sequencing technique to identify possible metal tolerant strains isolated from the metal-treated plant (Pb, Cd, Cr(VI), Ni, Au, Ag). The main dominants were Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria constituting together more than 97% of all reads. Metal treatment led to changes in the composition of the microbiome and showed significantly higher richness in the Pb-, Cd- and Cr-treated plant in comparison with other (95-105 versus 36-44). In these treatments the share of subdominant Actinobacteria (0.4-0.8%), Firmicutes (0.5-0.9%) and Bacteroidetes (0.2-0.9%) were higher than in non-treated plant (respectively: 0.02, 0.2 and 0.001%) and Ni-, Au- and Ag-treatments (respectively: <0.4%, <0.2% and up to 0.2%). The exception was Au-treatment displaying the abundance 1.86% of Bacteroidetes. In addition, possible metal tolerant genera, namely: Acinetobacter, Asticcacaulis, Anabaena, Bacillus, Brevundimonas, Burkholderia, Dyella, Methyloversatilis, Rhizobium and Staphylococcus, which form the core microbiome, were recognized by combining their abundance in all samples with literature data. Additionally, the presence of known metal tolerant genera was confirmed: Mucilaginibacter, Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, Corynebacterium, Stenotrophomonas, Clostridium, Micrococcus, Achromobacter, Geobacter, Flavobacterium, Arthrobacter and Delftia. We have evidenced that A. filiculoides possess a microbiome whose representatives belong to metal-resistant species which makes the fern the source of biotechnologically useful microorganisms for remediation processes."
https://openalex.org/W3021960701,"Antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) and antibacterial blue light (aBL) are emerging treatment methods auxiliary to mechanical debridement for periodontitis. APDT provided with near-infrared (NIR) light in conjunction with an indocyanine green (ICG) photosensitizer has shown efficacy in several dental in-office-treatment protocols. In this study, we tested Streptococcus mutans biofilm sensitivity to either aPDT, aBL or their combination dual-light aPDT (simultaneous aPDT and aBL) exposure. Biofilm was cultured by pipetting diluted Streptococcus mutans suspension with growth medium on the bottom of well plates. Either aPDT (810 nm) or aBL (405 nm) or a dual-light aPDT (simultaneous 810 nm aPDT and 405 nm aBL) was applied with an ICG photosensitizer in cases of aPDT or dual-light, while keeping the total given radiant exposure constant at 100 J/cm2. Single-dose light exposures were given after one-day or four-day biofilm incubations. Also, a model of daily treatment was provided by repeating the same light dose daily on four-day and fourteen-day biofilm incubations. Finally, the antibacterial action of the dual-light aPDT with different energy ratios of 810 nm and 405 nm of light were examined on the single-day and four-day biofilm protocols. At the end of each experiment the bacterial viability was assessed by colony-forming unit method. Separate samples were prepared for confocal 3D biofilm imaging. On a one-day biofilm, the dual-light aPDT was significantly more efficient than aBL or aPDT, although all modalities were bactericidal. On a four-day biofilm, a single exposure of aPDT or dual-light aPDT was more efficient than aBL, resulting in a four logarithmic scale reduction in bacterial counts. Surprisingly, when the same amount of aPDT was repeated daily on a four-day or a fourteen-day biofilm, bacterial viability improved significantly. A similar improvement in bacterial viability was observed after repetitive aBL application. This viability improvement was eliminated when dual-light aPDT was applied. By changing the 405 nm to 810 nm radiant exposure ratio in dual-light aPDT, the increase in aBL improved the antibacterial action when the biofilm was older. In conclusion, when aPDT is administered repeatedly to S. mutans biofilm, a single wavelength-based aBL or aPDT leads to a significant biofilm adaptation and increased S. mutans viability. The combined use of aBL light in synchrony with aPDT arrests the adaptation and provides significantly improved and sustained antibacterial efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3022830084,"Habitat-mediated global change is driving shifts in species' distributions which can alter the spatial risks associated with emerging zoonotic pathogens. Many emerging infectious pathogens are transmitted by highly mobile species, including bats, which can act as spill-over hosts for pathogenic viruses. Over three years, we investigated the seroepidemiology of paramyxoviruses and Australian bat lyssavirus in a range-expanding fruit bat, the Grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), in a new camp in Adelaide, South Australia. Over six, biannual, sampling sessions, we quantified median florescent intensity (MFI) antibody levels for four viruses for a total of 297 individual bats using a multiplex Luminex binding assay. Where appropriate, florescence thresholds were determined using finite mixture modelling to classify bats' serological status. Overall, apparent seroprevalence of antibodies directed at Hendra, Cedar and Tioman virus antigens was 43.2%, 26.6% and 95.7%, respectively. We used hurdle models to explore correlates of seropositivity and antibody levels when seropositive. Increased body condition was significantly associated with Hendra seropositivity (Odds ratio = 3.67; p = 0.002) and Hendra virus levels were significantly higher in pregnant females (p = 0.002). While most bats were seropositive for Tioman virus, antibody levels for this virus were significantly higher in adults (p < 0.001). Unexpectedly, all sera were negative for Australian bat lyssavirus. Temporal variation in antibody levels suggests that antibodies to Hendra virus and Tioman virus may wax and wane on a seasonal basis. These findings suggest a common exposure to Hendra virus and other paramyxoviruses in this flying fox camp in South Australia."
https://openalex.org/W3022030418,"While emerging evidence suggests the link between endothelial activation of TGF-β signaling, induction of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and cardiovascular disease (CVD), the molecular underpinning of this connection remains enigmatic. Here, we report aberrant expression of H19 lncRNA and TET1 in endothelial cells (ECs) of human atherosclerotic coronary arteries. Using primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and aortic endothelial cells (HAoECs) we show that TNF-α, a known risk factor for endothelial dysfunction and CVD, induces H19 expression which in turn activates TGF-β signaling and EndMT via a TET1-dependent epigenetic mechanism. We also show that H19 regulates TET1 expression at the posttranscriptional level. Further, we provide evidence that this H19/TET1-mediated regulation of TGF-β signaling and EndMT occurs in mouse pulmonary microvascular ECs in vivo under hyperglycemic conditions. We propose that endothelial activation of the H19/TET1 axis may play an important role in EndMT and perhaps CVD."
https://openalex.org/W3023465592,"The aim of this study is to determine the involvement of the flavonol-anthocyanin pathway on plant adaptation to biotic stress using the B.amyloliquefaciens QV15 to trigger blackberry metabolism and identify target genes to improve plant fitness and fruit quality. To achieve this goal, field-grown blackberries were root-inoculated with QV15 along its growth cycle. At fruiting, a transcriptomic analysis by RNA-Seq was performed on leaves and fruits of treated and non-treated field-grown blackberries after a sustained mildew outbreak; expression of the regulating and core genes of the Flavonol-Anthocyanin pathway were analysed by qPCR and metabolomic profiles by UHPLC/ESI-qTOF-MS; plant protection was found to be up to 88%. Overexpression of step-controlling genes in leaves and fruits, associated to lower concentration of flavonols and anthocyanins in QV15-treated plants, together with a higher protection suggest a phytoanticipin role for flavonols in blackberry; kempferol-3-O-rutinoside concentration was strikingly high. Overexpression of RuF3H (Flavonol-3-hidroxylase) suggests a pivotal role in the coordination of committing steps in this pathway, controlling carbon flux towards the different sinks. Furthermore, this C demand is supported by an activation of the photosynthetic machinery, and boosted by a coordinated control of ROS into a sub-lethal range, and associated to enhanced protection to biotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W3021471661,"Rationale Probe-based confocal endomicroscopy provides real time videos of autoflourescent elastin structures within the alveoli. With it, multiple changes in the elastin structure due to different diffuse parenchymal lung diseases have previously been described. However, these evaluations have mainly relied on qualitative evaluation by the examiner and manually selected parts post-examination. Objectives To develop a fully automatic method for quantifying structural properties of the imaged alveoli elastin and to perform a preliminary assessment of their diagnostic potential. Methods 46 patients underwent probe-based confocal endomicroscopy, of which 38 were divided into 4 groups categorizing different diffuse parenchymal lung diseases. 8 patients were imaged in representative healthy lung areas and used as control group. Alveolar elastin structures were automatically segmented with a trained machine learning algorithm and subsequently evaluated with two methods developed for quantifying the local thickness and structural connectivity. Measurements and main results The automatic segmentation algorithm performed generally well and all 4 patient groups showed statistically significant differences with median elastin thickness, standard deviation of thickness and connectivity compared to the control group. Conclusion Alveoli elastin structures can be quantified based on their structural connectivity and thickness statistics with a fully-automated algorithm and initial results highlight its potential for distinguishing parenchymal lung diseases from normal alveoli."
https://openalex.org/W3021771209,"Expression of the voltage gated proton channel (Hv1) as identified by immunocytochemistry has been reported previously in breast cancer tissue. Increased expression of HV1 was correlated with poor prognosis and decreased overall and disease-free survival but the mechanism of its involvement in the disease is unknown. Here we present electrophysiological recordings of HV1 channel activity, confirming its presence and function in the plasma membrane of a breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. With western blotting we identify significant levels of HV1 expression in 3 out of 8 ""triple negative"" breast cancer cell lines (estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptor expression negative). We examine the function of HV1 in breast cancer using MDA-MB-231 cells as a model by suppressing the expression of HV1 using shRNA (knock-down; KD) and by eliminating HV1 using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing (knock-out; KO). Surprisingly, these two approaches produced incongruous effects. Knock-down of HV1 using shRNA resulted in slower cell migration in a scratch assay and a significant reduction in H2O2 release. In contrast, HV1 Knock-out cells did not show reduced migration or H2O2 release. HV1 KO but not KD cells showed an increased glycolytic rate accompanied by an increase in p-AKT (phospho-AKT, Ser473) activity. The expression of CD171/LCAM-1, an adhesion molecule and prognostic indicator for breast cancer, was reduced in HV1 KO cells. When we compared MDA-MB-231 xenograft growth rates in immunocompromised mice, tumors from HV1 KO cells grew less than WT in mass, with lower staining for the Ki-67 marker for cell proliferation rate. Therefore, deletion of HV1 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells limits tumor growth rate. The limited growth thus appears to be independent of oxidant production by NADPH oxidase molecules and to be mediated by cell adhesion molecules. Although HV1 KO and KD affect certain cellular mechanisms differently, both implicate HV1-mediated pathways for control of tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 cell line."
https://openalex.org/W3021776095,"Recycled paper has the potential to be used as a mulch for vegetable production and can be adopted for the cultivation of Italian zucchini. However, there have been no studies about the water savings or crop coefficient values used in irrigation management in this system; therefore, there is a need for more research. In view of the above, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of recycled paper mulch on evaporation and evapotranspiration in Italian zucchini and to determine the crop coefficients in its developmental stages. The study was carried out in two cultivation cycles conducted at the Lysimetric Station in Viçosa, MG, Brazil. The experiments were installed in a randomized block design with four replicates. Four lysimeter cultivation treatments were applied: without mulch (C); with recycled paper as mulch (CP); with only recycled paper (P); and with Bahia grass (G). Irrigation and drainage measurements were performed daily to calculate the crop and reference evapotranspiration, and thus the crop coefficient (Kc) values. The following characteristics were evaluated: fruit yield, NDVI and water productivity. For the cultivation of Italian zucchini using paper as mulch, Kc values of 0.54, 0.77 and 0.44 and Kcb values of 0.15, 0.45 and 0.18 are recommended for the initial, intermediate and final stages, respectively. NDVI can be used to estimate the Kc values for Italian zucchini. The use of recycled paper as mulch reduces the water consumption of Italian zucchini."
https://openalex.org/W3021902477,"Access to the influenza vaccine pose little barriers in developed countries such as Singapore and vaccination against influenza is highly recommended for at-risk populations including older adults. However, vaccination rates are much lower than recommended despite the significant morbidity and mortality associated with the disease among this vulnerable population. Given timely goals to increase vaccine acceptance and uptake, we explored Singaporean older adults’ misperceptions about influenza disease and vaccine. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted among 76 Singaporean adults aged 65 and above with no focus on a specific area in Singapore. Data were analyzed with grounded theory methods to understand participants’ attitudes, perceptions, and knowledge. We developed in vivo codes that reflect the verbiage used by participants and exhaustively catalogued themes through a constant comparison coding method. Focusing specifically on older adults’ misperceptions, seven main themes about influenza disease or vaccine emerged from our data analysis: familiarity with influenza, misperceptions about influenza, personal susceptibility to influenza, familiarity with the influenza vaccine, misperceptions about the influenza vaccine, misperceptions about influenza vaccine usage, and opinions about and barriers to influenza vaccine uptake. Notably, there is a lack of adequate knowledge and motivation in vaccinating against influenza among older adults in Singapore. Health communication needs to be more tailored toward older adults’ message processing systems and engage health professionals’ involvement in addressing the influenza disease and vaccine misperceptions identified in this study."
https://openalex.org/W3023178157,"The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of autophagy inhibition on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and glucose homeostasis in young and aged mice. The transcriptional co-activator PGC-1α regulates muscle oxidative phenotype which has been shown to be linked with basal autophagic capacity. Therefore, young and aged inducible muscle-specific PGC-1α knockout (iMKO) mice and littermate lox/lox controls were used in three separate experiments performed after either saline or colchicine injections on two consecutive days: (1) Euthanization in the basal state obtaining skeletal muscle for mitochondrial respirometry, (2) whole body glucose tolerance test, and (3) in vivo insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake into skeletal muscle. Muscle PGC-1α was not required for maintaining basal autophagy flux, regardless of age. Colchicine-induced inhibition of autophagy was associated with impairments of skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, including reduced ADP sensitivity and altered mitochondrial redox balance in both young and aged mice. Colchicine treatment reduced the glucose tolerance in aged, but not young mice, and similarly in iMKO and lox/lox mice. Colchicine reduced insulin-stimulated 2-DG uptake in soleus muscle in aged mice, independently of PGC-1α, and without affecting insulin-regulated phosphorylation of proximal or distal mediators of insulin signaling. In conclusion, the results indicate that autophagy regulates the mitochondrial ADP sensitivity and redox balance as well as whole body glucose tolerance and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in aged mice, with no additional effects of inducible PGC-1α deletion."
https://openalex.org/W3022756709,"We report fossils of the darter Anhinga pannonica Lambrecht, 1916 from two late Miocene (Tortonian, 11.62 and 11.44 Ma) avifaunas in Southern Germany. The material from the hominid locality Hammerschmiede near Pforzen represents the most comprehensive record of this species and includes most major postcranial elements except for the tarsometatarsus. We furthermore show that the putative cormorant Phalacrocorax brunhuberi (von Ammon, 1918) from the middle Miocene of Regensburg-Dechbetten is another, previously misclassified, record of A. pannonica, and this may also be true for early Miocene fossils described as P. intermedius Milne-Edwards, 1867. A. pannonica was distinctly larger than extant darters and reached the size of A. grandis from the late Miocene of North America. We detail that only fossils from the Miocene of Europe and Africa can be referred to A. pannonica, whereas putative records from Asia fall within the size range of extant darters. A. pannonica appears to have been a long-living species (16 to 6 Ma) with an extensive distribution from the equator to the northern mid-latitudes. The extinction of large-sized darters in Europe is likely to have been due to climatic cooling in the late Neogene, but the reasons for their disappearance in Africa and South America remain elusive."
https://openalex.org/W3023289534,"Background Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is an emerging public health problem among HIV positives compared to the general population. This study aimed to assess the incidence and predictors of extrapulmonary tuberculosis among people living with HIV in selected health facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 01 January 2013 up to 31 December 2018. Methods A retrospective cohort study design was employed based on data collected from 566 HIV positive individuals. Data were entered using EpiInfo version 7.1 and analyzed by SPSS version 20. The incidence rate was determined per 100 person-years. Kaplan-Meier estimates used to estimate survivor and the hazard function, whereas log-rank tests used to compare survival curves and hazard across different categories. Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify the predictors and 95%CI of the hazard ratio were computed. P-value<0.05 in the multivariable analysis was considered statistically significant. Results Five hundred sixty-six HIV positive individuals were followed for 2140.08 person-years. Among them, 72 developed extrapulmonary tuberculosis that gives an incidence rate of 3.36/100 person-years (95%CI = 2.68–4.22). The most frequent forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis were; lymph node tuberculosis (56%, 41) followed equally by pleural tuberculosis (15%, 11) and disseminated tuberculosis (15%, 11). The majority (70.83%) of the cases occurred within the first year of follow-up. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, baseline WHO stage III/IV (AHR = 2.720, 95%CI = 1.575–4.697), baseline CD4 count<50cells/μl (AHR = 4.073, 95%CI = 2.064–8.040), baseline CD4 count 50–200 cells/μl (AHR = 2.360, 95%CI = 1.314–4.239) and baseline Hgb<10 mg/dl (AHR = 1.979, 95%CI = 1.091–3.591) were the independent risk factors. While isoniazid prophylaxis (AHR = 0.232, 95%CI = 0.095–0.565) and taking antiretroviral drugs (AHR = 0.134, 95%CI = 0.075–0.238) had a protective benefit. Conclusion Extrapulmonary tuberculosis co-infection was common among HIV positive individuals, and mostly occurred in those with advanced immune suppression. The risk decreases in those taking antiretroviral therapy and took isoniazid preventive treatment. Screening of HIV positives for extrapulmonary tuberculosis throughout their follow-up would be important."

Results The linear mixed effect models are to be preferred over the meta-analysis method, since the individual effects are estimated more accurately as evidenced by the lower errors, especially with lower sample sizes. Differences between Bayesian and frequentist mixed models were found to be small, indicating that they will lead to the same results without including an informative prior. Conclusion For empirical data, the Bayesian mixed model allows the inclusion of prior knowledge and gives potential for population based and personalized inference."
https://openalex.org/W3022190392,"The margay (Leopardus wiedii) is a small Neotropical arboreal wild cat. This species is thought to be forest-dependent, although few studies so far have directly evaluated the relationships between spatiotemporal aspects of its ecology and landscape characteristics. The aim of this study was to estimate margay population density and activity patterns in six areas with different habitat types and levels of anthropogenic disturbance in the southernmost Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Our working hypothesis was that density and activity patterns differed between areas in response to differences in forest cover and anthropogenic disturbance. Margay records were obtained using camera trapping, during spring and summer from 2017 to 2019. In all areas, the sampling scheme consisted of 20 un-baited stations, set 1km apart, each containing two paired cameras. We assessed the potential effects of environmental variables, including anthropogenic factors, on margay density, rate of detection and space use by comparing nine spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models. Activity patterns of the margay, its potential prey, and competitors were described and compared using the date and time of the records. We obtained 66 records of margay. Two of the six sampled areas were excluded from subsequent analyses due to the small number of records. The density estimated by the top-ranked model varied from 9.6±6.4 individuals/100km2 in the area with the highest human disturbance to 37.4±15.1 individuals/100km2 in a less disturbed area. Margay densities responded positively to vegetation cover, supporting the hypothesis of forest dependence by the species. Both the margay and their potential prey (small rodents and marsupials) were found to be mostly nocturnal. Margay activity also overlapped with that of the ocelot, Leopardus pardalis, and with mammals associated with human presence (wild boar, cattle, domestic dogs and cats). This is the first multi-area study on patterns of density and activity of the margay in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We concluded that the margay is mostly nocturnal, and while its densities are positively influenced by forest cover and negatively influenced by human disturbance, the activity pattern of the species does not seem to change across landscapes with distinct levels of human modification. Margay populations seem to be able to persist under moderate levels of habitat modification, highlighting the importance of preserving even small native forest remnants in the highly fragmented Atlantic Forest."
https://openalex.org/W3022945973,"Abstract Temozolomide (TMZ) insensitivity and resistance are major causes of treatment failure and poor prognosis for GBM patients. Here, we identify LRRC4 as a novel autophagy inhibitor that restores the sensitivity of GBMs to TMZ. LRRC4 was associated with the DEPTOR/mTOR complex, and this interaction resulted in autophagy inhibition. Further investigation demonstrated that the PDZ binding domain of LRRC4 binds to the PDZ domain of DEPTOR. This binding decreases the half-life of DEPTOR via ubiquitination, thus inhibiting GBM cell autophagy and increasing the TMZ treatment response of GBM. Combined LRRC4 expression and TMZ treatment prolonged the survival of mice with tumour xenografts. Furthermore, the levels of LRRC4, DEPTOR and autophagy are clinically relevant for GBM, indicating that LRRC4 is likely to have significant potential as a therapeutic marker and target for TMZ treatment in glioma patients."
https://openalex.org/W3021535088,"The present investigation tests: (i) whether the perception of an human infant’s eyes, relative to other facial features, especially strongly elicits “parental” responses (e.g., appraisals of cuteness and vulnerability); (ii) if, so, whether effects of the visual perception of eyes may be partially attributable to eye contact; (iii) whether the perception of non-human animals’ (puppy dogs’) eyes also especially strongly influence appraisals of their cuteness and vulnerability; and (iv) whether individual differences in caregiving motives moderate effects. Results from 5 experiments (total N = 1458 parents and non-parents) provided empirical evidence to evaluate these hypotheses: Appraisals of human infants were influenced especially strongly by the visual perception of human infants’ eyes (compared to other facial features); these effects do not appear to be attributable to eye contact; the visual perception of eyes influenced appraisals of puppy dogs, but not exactly in the same way that it influenced appraisals of human infants; and there was no consistent evidence of moderation by individual differences in caregiving motives. These results make novel contributions to several psychological literatures, including literatures on the motivational psychology of parental care and on person perception."
https://openalex.org/W3020965381,"Onodera’s prognostic nutritional index (PNI) is useful in predicting prognosis of various diseases. But the usefulness of PNI in non-surgical patients has not been sufficiently proven yet. In patients with mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease (MAC-PD), malnutrition is an important factor that affects the quality of life and morbidity. Here, we aimed to evaluate whether PNI is related with clinical outcomes in MAC-PD patients. We examined 663 patients diagnosed with MAC-PD between May 2005 and November 2017. PNI score was calculated at the time of diagnosis and treatment initiation, and patients were divided into malnutrition and non-malnutrition groups according to a cut-off PNI score of 45. As the recommended duration of treatment for MAC-PD is 12 months following sputum conversion, treatment duration less than 12 months was defined as treatment intolerance. Survivals were compared with the log-rank test. Multivariate logistic regression and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and hazards ratio (HR) for treatment intolerance and mortality, respectively. Of the 306 patients that received treatment, 193 received treatment longer than 12 months. In the multivariable logistic regression model, malnutrition at the time of treatment initiation was related with treatment intolerance (OR: 2.559, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.414–4.634, P = 0.002). Patients in the malnutrition group at the time of diagnosis exhibited lower survival (P<0.001) and malnutrition at the time of diagnosis was a significant risk for all-cause mortality (HR: 2.755, 95% CI: 1.610–4.475, P<0.001). Malnutrition, as defined by PNI, is an independent predictor for treatment intolerance and all-cause mortality in patients with MAC-PD."
https://openalex.org/W3023558695,"Background Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has an increasing non-communicable disease burden. Tanzania has an incidence of more than 35,000 cancer cases per year with an 80% mortality rate. Hematological malignancies account for 10% of these cases. The numbers will double within the next 10 years due to demographic changes, better diagnostic capabilities and life style changes. Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre established a Cancer Care Centre (CCC) in December 2016 for a catchment area of 15 million people in Northern Tanzania. This article aims to display the hematological diagnosis and characteristics of the patients as well as to describe the advancements of hematologic services in a low resource setting. Methods A cross-sectional analysis of all hematological malignancies at CCC from December 2016 to May 2019 was performed and a narrative report provides information about diagnostic means, treatment and the use of synergies. Results A total of 209 cases have been documented, the most common malignancies were NHL and MM with 44% and 20%. 36% of NHL cases, 16% of MM cases and 63% of CML cases were seen in patients under the age of 45. When subcategorized, CLL/SLL cases had a median age was 56.5, 51 years for those with other entities of NHL. Sexes were almost equally balanced in all NHL groups while clear male predominance was found in HL and CML. Discussion Malignancies occur at a younger age and higher stages than in Western countries. It can be assumed that infections play a key role herein. Closing the gap of hematologic services in SSA can be achieved by adapting and reshaping existing infrastructure and partnering with international organizations."

This study developed a predesigned varied-discharge irrigation scheme in the closed-ended border. Field treatments, including continuous-discharge (CD), increased-discharge (ID) and decreased-discharge (DD) border irrigation tests, were conducted to evaluate the irrigation performance of the proposed varied-discharge scheme. The DD border irrigation treatment had great application efficiency (AE), distribution uniformity (DU) and requirement efficiency (RE), and its comprehensive evaluation indicator (Y) was also significantly higher than other treatments. DD treatment achieved the average AE, DU, RE and Y values of 91.4%, 95.5%, 99.5% and 95.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the hydraulic simulation model WinSRFR was used to optimize the scheme of predesigned varied-discharge border irrigation, and sensitivity analyses of infiltration parameters, roughness coefficient, slope and inflow rate were carried out. The results indicate that the predesigned varied-discharge border irrigation scheme can improve the irrigation performance, and the DD border irrigation scheme has more satisfactory robustness than that of the ID border irrigation scheme."

This is a compact, two-lens illumination system with a constant power objective lens, without any energy filters or aberration correctors, often thought of as a “screening cryo-microscope”. Coulomb potential maps reveal clear densities for main chain carbonyl oxygens, residue side chains (including alternative conformations) and bound solvent molecules. We used a quasi-crystallographic reciprocal space approach to fit model coordinates to the experimental cryo-EM map. We argue that the advantages offered by (a) the high electronic and mechanical stability of the microscope, (b) the high emission stability and low beam energy spread of the high brightness Field Emission Gun (X-FEG), (c) direct electron detection technology and (d) particle-based Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) refinement have contributed to achieving high resolution. Overall, we show that basic electron optical settings for automated cryo-electron microscopy imaging can be used to determine structures approaching atomic resolution."

Herein, a comprehensive analysis of interscapular BAT from C57BL/6J female mice was conducted by 2DLC and high-resolution mass spectrometry to construct a comprehensive proteome dataset of mouse BAT proteins. A total of 4949 nonredundant proteins were identified, and 4495 were quantified using the iBAQ method. According to the iBAQ values, the BAT proteome was divided into high-, middle- and low-abundance proteins. The functions of the high-abundance proteins were mainly related to glucose and fatty acid oxidation to produce heat for thermoregulation, while the functions of the middle- and low-abundance proteins were mainly related to protein synthesis and apoptosis, respectively. Additionally, 497 proteins were predicted to have signal peptides using SignalP4 software, and 75 were confirmed in previous studies. This study, for the first time, comprehensively profiled and functionally annotated the BAT proteome. This study will be helpful for future studies focused on biomarker identification and BAT molecular mechanisms."

In mammals, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) plays a pivotal role in cholinergic brain synapses and neuromuscular junctions through the termination of impulse transmission via rapid hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ACh), an important cationic neurotransmitter in the nervous system (1Tougu V. Acetylcholinesterase: mechanism of catalysis and inhibition.Curr. Med. Chem. Central Nervous Syst. Agents. 2001; 1: 155-17010.2174/1568015013358536Crossref Google Scholar). The rapid hydrolysis of ACh into acetic acid and choline by AChE is achieved at a rate close to that of a diffusion-controlled reaction and, therefore, AChE is recognized as one of the most efficient enzymes in nature (2Quinn D.M. Acetylcholinesterase: enzyme structure, reaction dynamics, and virtual transition states.Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 955-97910.1021/cr00081a005Crossref Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Having a catalytic triad consisting of Ser, His, and Glu residues, AchE follows the classical esterase mechanism (3Rauwerdink A. Kazlauskas R.J. How the same core catalytic machinery catalyzes 17 different reactions: the serine-histidine-aspartate catalytic triad of α/β-hydrolase fold enzymes.ACS Catal. 2015; 5 (28580193): 6153-617610.1021/acscatal.5b01539Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and two half-reactions are required to complete the full catalytic cycle. In recent decades, the structure and function study of the AChEs from metazoans has been particularly important in the context of the development of inhibitors to block the activity of AChE for various purposes, e.g. the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (4Colović M.B.

The putative acetylcholinesterase from P. aeruginosa strain PAO1, named ChoE, has also been characterized (12Sánchez D.G. Otero L.H. Hernández C.M. Serra A.L. Encarnación S. Domenech C.E. Lisa A.T.

Despite its small size (287 residues) relative to that of eukaryotic AChEs (∼560 residues), ChoE is able to catalyze the hydrolysis of both acetylthiocholine (ATCh) and its analog propionylthiocholine (PTCh). The purified ChoE enzyme of P. aeruginosa is inhibited by substrate at high substrate concentrations, exhibiting enzymatic properties similar to eukaryotic AChEs (12Sánchez D.G. Otero L.H.

In view of the enzymatic activity of ChoE as well as the abundance of ACh present in the corneal epithelium (17Pesin S.R. Candia O.A. Acetylcholine concentration and its role in ionic transport by the corneal epithelium.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa cholinesterase and phosphorylcholine phosphatase: two enzymes contributing to corneal infection.FEMS Microbiol.

Production of choline by ChoE for subsequent catabolic processes by other metabolic pathways was also suggested to be linked to the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa and its survival during murine lung infection (19Lisa T.A.

In contrast to the eukaryotic AChEs, little is known about the structure and molecular mechanism of prokaryotic acetylcholinesterases. Due to the low sequence identity (<26%) between ChoE and the proteins whose structures are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), it remains elusive how this enzyme works at the molecular level. In this study, we have performed structural and biochemical characterization of ChoE. Multiple structures were determined at a resolution of 1.35-1.85 Å in the presence of substrates, products, or reaction intermediate using both WT and the catalytic triad mutants. These results have uncovered the first atomic details of a putative bacterial acetylcholinesterase and provided insights into the mechanism of substrate inhibition. Choline can serve as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen to support P. aeruginosa growth and can be acquired through an acetylcholinesterase activity of ChoE, encoded by the choE (PA4921) gene (12Sánchez D.G. Otero L.H. Hernández C.M. Serra A.L. Encarnación S. Domenech C.E. Lisa A.T.

Growth of the WT PAO1 strain and the deletion mutant strain PAO1::ΔPA4921 (PW9287) was assessed in a microplate reader at 37 °C and both strains were unable to grow in salt solution containing 0.66% KH2PO4, 0.3% K2HPO4, and 0.3% MgSO4, unless choline was added as a source of carbon and nitrogen. The WT strain was able to use ACh as a substrate, but the mutant strain could not (Table 1). These results confirmed that ChoE is required for the bacteria to grow when ACh is the sole source of carbon and nitrogen.Table 1P. aeruginosa growth in salt solution supplemented or not with choline or acetylcholineSalt solutionSalt solution with 20 mm cholineSalt solution with 20 mm acetylcholineWT strain (PAO1)−aGrowth is shown by a plus (+) or a double plus (++), according to the extent of growth, and no growth by a minus (−).

Open table in a new tab Using both ATCh and PTCh substrates, we studied the enzyme kinetics of WT ChoE and mutants of the catalytic triad and substrate-binding residues. Our results showed that WT ChoE has similar activity on ATCh and PTCh (Table 2 and Fig. 1A). Based on the apparent catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), ChoE exhibits slightly higher specificity on PTCh, consistent with the previous report (12Sánchez D.G. Otero L.H. Hernández C.M. Serra A.L.

Using an elevated concentration (30 nm) of ChoE, we also detected its activity toward butyrylthiocholine (BTCh) (Table 2 and Fig. 1A) in contrast to the previous report in which a lower concentration of enzyme was used (12Sánchez D.G.

In our assays, substrate inhibition was observed at high concentrations of the substrate with a KSI(app) of 0.9 mm for ATCh. Substrate inhibition was modeled upon the mechanism first described by Krupka (21Krupka R.M. The mechanism of action of acetylcholinesterase: substrate inhibition and the binding of inhibitors.Biochemistry. 1963; 2 (13927118): 76-8210.1021/bi00901a015Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that considered substrate inhibition of AChE as arising from trapping an EIS (acyl-enzyme intermediate substrate complex) at high substrate concentrations. Such EIS complex of ChoE would be kinetically undistinguishable from an EPS complex (enzyme product-substrate ternary complex) and is thus fully consistent with the EPS observed in the crystal structures of ChoE (see below). Although the kinetic data could be equally well fitted with a model describing inhibition as arising from the formation of an enzyme-substrate-substrate complex (ESS, Table 2), as assumed by Sánchez et al.

Open table in a new tab The enzymatic assays carried out with the catalytic triad mutants (S38A, D285N, and H288N) showed that the catalytic activity was abolished in both S38A and H288N mutants, whereas the D285N mutation diminished the enzymatic activity severely, indicating that both Ser-38 and His-288 are indispensable for ChoE to fulfill its hydrolase function (Table 2 and Fig. 1B). Notably, replacement of Asp-285 by an asparagine has led to a 40-fold reduction of kcat(app) together with an increase of Km(app) by 16-fold, reflecting a 640-fold drop of catalytic efficiency when ATCh is the substrate. The large impact on kcat(app) upon mutation indicates that Asp-285 is, albeit not essential, an important component of catalytic triad in ChoE. The kinetic analysis of the mutants of substrate-binding residues (Y106A and W287A) (Table 2 and Fig. S1) using ATCh and PTCh as substrates indicated that the Y106A mutation has led to less than ∼2-fold drop of kcat(app) but to a 14-20-fold increase of Km(app), whereas the W287A mutation has resulted in a small or no change of kcat(app) accompanied by a 16-fold increase of Km(app). Intriguingly, substrate inhibition is abolished for all three mutants D285N, Y106A, and W287A. The kinetic analysis of ChoE with the substrates 4-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA), 4-nitrophenyl propionate (pNPP), 4-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB), and 4-nitrophenyl octanoate (pNPO) demonstrated that ChoE exhibits a lower specificity on these p-nitrophenyl esters as compared with the ATCh and PTCh substrates (Table 2 and Fig. 1C). Importantly, the esters bearing extra C-C bonds beyond the propionyl group, such as pNPB and pNPO, are either not substrates or very poor substrates, consistent with our molecular docking in which the esters with a long tail could not be accommodated in the active site pocket with a proper geometry required for catalysis (Fig. S2). Taken together with the data on ATCh, PTCh, and BTCh, these results suggest that the substrates of ChoE with high specificity are limited to the esters having an acetyl or a propionyl group. Notably, no substrate inhibition was observed with two of the p-nitrophenyl esters (pNPA and pNPP). This may well be the case of the third substrate (pNPB) but because it was not soluble at more than 1 mm in our assay condition, the absence of substrate inhibition could not be verified with this substrate. Prompted by the docking results (Fig. S2), we have also investigated the inhibitory effects of tetraethylammonium chloride (TEAC) and propidium iodide (PI), the latter of which is an inhibitor that can bind to either the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of mouse AChE (22Bourne Y. Taylor P. Radic Z. Marchot P.

These two molecules contain a quaternary ammonium group, similar to ATCh and PTCh. Kinetic analysis has confirmed that the presence of either molecule at 1 mm could indeed inhibit the activity of ChoE leading to a 3.5-20-fold decrease of kcat(app) when ATCh was used as the substrate, whereas essentially not affecting Km(app). Interestingly, the KSI(app) values for substrate inhibition by ATCh were much higher (13-194–fold) in the presence of TEAC or PI (Table 2 and Fig. 1D). The DNA sequence encoding the signal peptide (residues 1-20) at the N-terminal was not included in our construct. All the residues (21-307) in the mature protein are built into the model because of the excellent quality of electron density maps. Having five β-strands with an order of β2-β1-β3-β4-β5 and 10 α-helices, ChoE has the characteristic α/β/α-globular fold of the SGNH hydrolase family (24Mølgaard A. Kauppinen S. Larsen S.

However, these enzymes share a relatively low sequence identity of 23–26% with ChoE. Notably, EstJ15 has the same Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad as that in ChoE, whereas VvPlpA lacks the Asp residue in the catalytic triad of ChoE and EstJ15 and instead utilizes an unusual Ser-His-chloride catalytic triad to fulfill the catalysis (28Wan Y. Liu C. Ma Q. Structural analysis of a Vibrio phospholipase reveals an unusual Ser-His-chloride catalytic triad.J. Biol.

Similar to EstJ15 and VvPlpA, ChoE is monomeric based on size exclusion chromatography and the crystal structures. It is worth mentioning that, for the 10 most similar proteins retrieved from the DALI search, none contained a substrate or a product molecule in the active site. Quite remarkably, despite the same reaction being catalyzed by ChoE and eukaryotic AChEs, their overall structures bear no similarities. All the structures reported here were obtained from the crystallization conditions containing 100 mm MES buffer. The native ChoE structure determined at a resolution of 1.35 Å shows unambiguously the presence of a MES molecule in the substrate-binding pocket located at the center of ChoE (Fig. 3A). Calculation of electrostatic potential indicated that this pocket is negatively charged (Fig. 3B), a structural feature facilitating the entrapment of the positively charged quaternary ammonium moiety of the ACh substrate. As shown in Fig. 3C, the MES molecule is bound to the substrate-binding pocket lined by the aromatic residues Trp-73, Tyr-106, Tyr-107, Phe-150, and Trp-287. At the bottom of the pocket are the catalytic residues Ser-38 and His-288 as well as the oxyanion hole composed of Gly-98 and Asn-147. Asp-285, the third residue forming the catalytic triad, is next to His-288, such that His-288 is within the hydrogen bonding distance (2.6-2.9 Å) of both Asp-285 and Ser-38, the pattern of which is similar to that of eukaryotic AChEs (5Sussman J. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I.

In this structure, the ethanesulfonic moiety of MES is exposed to the solvent and interacts with Tyr-107 and Asp-154 via water-mediated hydrogen bonds, whereas its morpholine ring is buried inside the pocket with its oxygen atom close to a well-defined water molecule (Wat-459) (3.2 Å) at the bottom of the pocket. Located at the center of the oxyanion hole, this water molecule is stabilized by the hydrogen bonds with the main chain amide groups of Ser-38 and Gly-98, the hydroxyl group of Ser-38 as well as the side chain amide group of Asn-147. Both Asp-285 and His-288 are located at a U-turn loop where Asp-285 forms hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl of Tyr-68 and the main chain amides of Glu-286, Trp-287, and His-288 at this loop. These interactions contribute significantly to the stabilization of the local structure as evidenced by the fact that the D285A mutant is insoluble, presumably due to the perturbation or disruption of the overall folding of the protein. Similarly, the imidazole ring of His-288 is sandwiched between Trp-73 and Trp-287 and also establishes van der Waals contacts with Tyr-39, suggesting a structural role of the His-288 side chain. To minimize the detrimental effects on the local structure and increase our chance to obtain structures of relevant protein-ligand complexes as exemplified in our previous work (32Shi R. Lamb S.S.

https://openalex.org/W3023515530,"The phylogeography of the holoplanktonic chaetognath Flaccisagitta enflata was investigated in the Tropical Western Atlantic (TWA). Considering the cosmopolitan range of this species and the fact that its entire life cycle is planktonic, the central hypothesis of this study is that F. enflata exhibits connectivity due to its high dispersal capacity, forming a panmictic population among the study sites. The evaluated areas included neritic (Port of Recife–PR, and Tamandaré - TA) and oceanic (Fernando de Noronha Archipelago—FN, Rocas Atoll—RA, Guará seamount—GS and Saint Peter and Saint Paul’s Archipelago—SPSPA) locations of the Brazilian Blue Amazon. We used COI gene sequences as molecular marker. Partial sequences (425 bp) were obtained for 116 specimens and employed to reconstruct the phylogeny, build an haplotype network, evaluate gene flow through a migration model, and estimate diversity indices, population structuring and demographic history. High levels of haplotype diversity (mean: 0.98) and moderate to high levels of nucleotide diversity (mean: 0.023) were observed. The phylogeny and the haplotype network topologies showed some geographic clustering, indicating local structuring in GS and PR. This finding was supported by the AMOVA high global Φst (0.033, significant) and some pairwise Φst comparisons (7 out of 15 were significantly >0). Significant differences suggested lower levels of connectivity when GS population was compared to those of FN and SPSPA; as well as when TA was compared to FN. These results might be related to particularities of the oceanic dynamics which rules the TWA, sustaining such dissimilarities. Structuring was also observed between PR and all oceanic locations. We hypothesize that the topography of the port inlet, enclosured by a reef barrier, may constrain the water turnover ratio and thus migration rates of F. enflata in the TWA. Accordingly, Migrate-N yielded a four metapopulations model (PR ⇌ TA ⇌ SPSPA+FN ⇌ GS+RA) as the best (highest probability; ~0.90) to represent the structuring of F. enflata in the TWA. Therefore, the null hypothesis of one randomly mating population cannot be accepted. The demographic evaluation demonstrated that the neutral hypothesis of stable populations may not be rejected for most of the locations. This work is the start point to broaden the knowledge on the phylogeography and population genetic structure of a numerically dominant species in the Western Atlantic, with key role in the marine trophic web."
https://openalex.org/W3023652415,"Objectives Fathers of infants admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) play an important role and have individual needs that are often not recognised. While there is considerable evidence regarding mothers’ needs in the NICU, information about fathers’ is particularly limited. This study identifies the needs of fathers of newborns admitted to NICU for general surgery of major congenital anomalies, and whether health-care professionals meet these needs. Methods Forty-eight fathers of infants admitted for surgery between February 2014 and September 2015 were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Fathers completed the Neonatal Family Needs Inventory comprising 56 items in 5 subscales (Support, Comfort, Information, Proximity, Assurance) at admission and discharge and whether these needs were met; as well as the Social Desirability Scale. Results Responses showed Assurance was the most important subscale (M 3.8, SD .26). Having questions answered honestly (M 3.9, SD .20) and knowing staff provide comfort to their infant (M 3.94, SD .24) were fathers’ most important needs. By discharge, fathers expressed a greater importance on being recognised and more involved in their infant’s care. More than 91% indicated their ten most important needs were met by the NICU health-care professionals, with no significant changes at discharge. Clergical visits (M 2.08, SD 1.21) were least important. Conclusions Reassurance is a priority for fathers of neonates in a surgical NICU, particularly regarding infant pain management and comfort. It is important that health-care professionals provide reliable, honest information and open-access visiting. Notably, fathers seek greater recognition of their role in the NICU—beyond being the ‘other’ parent."
https://openalex.org/W3021423485,"Background Unemployment is associated with a high prevalence of risky health behaviors. Mortality increases with the number of co-occurring risky behaviors but whether these behaviors co-occur with a greater than expected frequency (clustering) among unemployed people is not known. Methods Differences according to unemployment status in co-occurrence and clustering of smoking, alcohol abuse, low leisure-time physical activity and unhealthy diet (marked by low fruit and vegetable intake) were assessed in 65,630 salaried workers, aged 18 to 65, who were participants in Constances, a French population-based cohort. Among them, 4573 (7.0%) were unemployed without (n = 3160, 4.8%) or with (n = 1413, 2.1%) past experience of unemployment. Results Compared to the employed, unemployed participants without or with past experience of unemployment were similarly overexposed to each risky behavior (sex and age adjusted odds-ratios ranging from 1.38 to 2.19) except for low physical activity, resulting in higher rates of co-occurrence of two, three and four behaviors (relative risk ratios, RRR 1.20 to 3.74). Association between behavior co-occurrence and unemployment did not vary across gender, partnership status or income category. Risky behavior clustering, i.e., higher than expected co-occurrence rates based on the prevalence of each behavior, was similar across unemployment status. The same observations can be made in employed participants with past experience of unemployment, although overexposure to risky behaviors (ORs 1.15 to 1.38) and increased rates of co-occurrence (ORs 1.19 to 1.58) were not as pronounced as in the unemployed. Conclusions Co-occurrence of risky behaviors in currently and/or formerly unemployed workers is not worsened by behavior clustering. Engagement in each of these behaviors should be considered an engagement in distinct social practices, with consequences for preventive policies."
https://openalex.org/W3021743345,"Evaluation of the role of androgen receptor (AR) in the biology of breast cancer is an emerging area of research. There are compelling evidences that AR expression may be used to further refine breast cancer molecular subtyping with prognostic and therapeutic implications. Many studies indicated co-expression of AR with the hormonal receptors in breast cancer has a favorable prognosis. AR is also investigated by many researchers as a potential therapeutic target in treatment of breast cancer. Studies on the frequency and distribution of AR in breast cancer among Africans is barely available. Given the heightened interest to understand its role in breast cancer, we determined AR expression and assessed its association with clinicopathological parameters among Ethiopian women. In this study, 112 newly diagnosed patient with invasive breast cancer at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital were enrolled. Immunohistochemical assessment of AR, ER, PR, Ki67 and HER2 were performed using tissue microarrays (TMA) constructed from their primary tumor block. Out of the 112 participants, 91 (81%) were positive for AR expression and the remaining 21 participants (19%) were negative for AR expression. Expression of AR in ER+, HER2+ and TNBC cases were 93%, 83% and 48% respectively. Our study reveals AR is expressed in a significant number of breast cancers patients and this may indicate that breast cancers cases in Ethiopia have favorable prognosis and could benefit from progresses in AR targeted treatments. Since AR expression has important consequences on the prognosis and treatment of breast cancer, further studies with an increased number of participants is necessary to confirm our reports."
https://openalex.org/W3022176582,"Background In Brazil, penile cancer (PC) is not uncommon. The highest incidence of PC is in the North and Northeast of the country. In addition to phimosis, the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Baar Virus (EBV) infections are also related as risk factors for PC. The overexpression of p16INK4a is a surrogate sensitive marker of HPV infection in PC. Objectives To correlate p16INK4a overexpression and HPV infection status with EBV infection in a series of PC patients from the Amazon region. Methods Tumor tissues from 47 PC cases were analyzed for the presence of HPV and EBV DNA by PCR. All PC patients were diagnosed between 2013 and 2018 at a public reference cancer center hospital in Manaus, Amazonas—Brazil. HPV was genotyped using E7 HPV16/HPV18 type-specific real-time PCR and the PapilloCheck® HPV-Screening assay. p16INK4a expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using the automated Ventana® BenchMark Ultra. Results The mean age of patients at the time of diagnosis was 57.4 years ±SD 17.8 ranging from 20 to 90 years old. Most of the patients (64%) came from rural areas of the Amazonas State. Thirty patients had phimosis (64%). Among the patients with phimosis, 43% (13/30) underwent circumcision, three during childhood and 10 in adulthood. 60% of the patients were smokers or ex-smokers. HPV infection was observed in 45% (21/47) of cases. HPV16 was detected in 13 patients (61%). Other HPV types detected were HPV 6, 11, 42, 51, 53, 68 and 44/55. EBV infection was observed in 30% (14/47) of the patients with PC. Co-infection with HPV and EBV was observed in 28% (6/21) cases. p16INK4a was only investigated in 26 samples. The p16INK4a overexpression was observed exclusively in HPV 16 positive cases and four HPV negative cases. In the survival analysis, the follow-up time was 35.4 months/patient. The mortality rate during the follow up time was 38%. Conclusions p16INK4a positivity presented a high correlation to HPV 16 DNA detection, reinforcing its use as a surrogate marker for HPV-driven cancers. Infection with EBV was quite frequent and its role in epithelial penile oncogenesis needs to be demonstrated."

Among the three domains of complexity, only plot complexity was found to be related to gender and to develop significantly, in particular at 5 and 7 years of age. Evaluative complexity was low in children in all age groups and was not predicted by any factor. Syntactic complexity was predicted by executive function. These findings are discussed considering the cognitive, linguistic and sociocultural nature of narration."
https://openalex.org/W3022397536,"Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) continues to be a leading challenge in modern oncology. Early detection via blood-based screening tests has the potential to cause a stage-shift at diagnosis and improve clinical outcomes. Tumor associated autoantibodies (TA-AAbs) have previously shown the ability to distinguish HCC from patients with high-risk liver disease. This research aimed to further show the utility of TA-AAbs as biomarkers of HCC and assess their use in combination with Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for detection of HCC across multiple tumor stages. Methods Levels of circulating G class antibodies to 44 recombinant tumor associated antigens and circulating AFP were measured in the serum of patients with HCC, non-cancerous chronic liver disease (NCCLD) and healthy controls via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). TA-AAb cut-offs were set at the highest Youden’s J statistic at a specificity ≥95.00%. Panels of TA-AAbs were formed using net reclassification improvement. AFP was assessed at a cut-off of 200 ng/ml. Results Sensitivities ranged from 1.01% to 12.24% at specificities of 95.96% to 100.00% for single TA-AAbs. An ELISA test measuring a panel of 10 of these TA-AAbs achieved a combined sensitivity of 36.73% at a specificity of 89.89% when distinguishing HCC from NCCLD controls. At a cut-off of 200 ng/ml, AFP achieved a sensitivity of 31.63% at a specificity of 100.00% in the same cohort. Combination of the TA-AAb panel with AFP significantly increased the sensitivity for stage one (40.00%) and two (55.00%) HCC over the TA-AAb panel or AFP alone. Conclusions A panel of TA-AAbs in combination with AFP could be clinically relevant as a replacement for measuring levels of AFP alone in surveillance and diagnosis strategies. The increased early stage sensitivity could lead to a stage shift with positive prognostic outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3023406442,"Introduction Plasma is considered the gold standard for HIV viral load (VL) testing, however its use is challenging due to the need for phlebotomy and centrifugation services, as well as cold chain for transporting to laboratories for testing. The use of Dried Blood Spot (DBS) specimen has allowed a rapid expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) monitoring in remote areas in many African countries, however, the VL in DBS may overestimate the copies of viral RNA result at the clinically relevant range of 1000 copies/ml, due to proviral DNA and intracellular RNA. The characteristics of the cobas® Plasma Separation Card (PSC) specimen are similar to fresh plasma (gold standard), so a better performance of HIV VL is expetected in PSC specimen and can be an alternative to DBS. This study aims to evaluate the performance of cobas® PSC for VL testing at primary health care facilities in Mozambique. Methodology HIV-1 infected adults on ART were enrolled consecutively in two health facilities in Mozambique, between August 2018 and October 2018. Capillary and venous cobas® PSC, DBS and fresh plasma specimens were collected from each patient. All specimens were tested for VL using CAP/CTM v2.0. Sensitivity and specificity of viral load using DBS, capillary and venous PSC specimens were estimated. Viral load obtained in fresh plasma specimen was used as reference and a threshold of 1000 copies/ml was considered for the analyses. Results From the total 613 patients included for the study, 2444 specimens including DBS (613), plasma (613), venous cobas® PSC (609) and capillary cobas® PSC (609) were collected and 2407 results were obtained. Sensitivity and specificity of the VL using venous cobas®PSC specimen at 1000 copies/ml threshold were 99.8% and 98.1% respectively, whereas for capillary cobas® PSC sensitivity was 99.6% and specificity was 97.2%. For DBS VL, sensitivity was 96.9% and specificity was 81.8%. Misclassification rate was more prominent in DBS specimens (5.9%), but lower in venous and capillary cobas®PSC with a rate of 0.3% and 0.7% respectively. Conclusion The cobas® PSC specimen has improved performance over DBS for more accurate VL testing aligned with plasma testing. The use of this specimen type can increase the rates of reliable VL results and this will improve the quality of VL monitoring of HIV-positive patients in low-income settings."
https://openalex.org/W3023505822,"The potential effects of Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) maize on non-target organisms must be conducted before the Bt maize is commercially planted. Folsomia candida is one of the non-target organisms of Bt maize, also as an important indicator of soil quality and environmental pollution. In this study, a 90-day F. candida feeding test were conducted to evaluate the potential effects of two Bt maize lines IE09S034 and BT799 and their non-Bt conventional isolines Zong 31 and Zheng 58. The results show that Bt maize lines had no significant effects on the survival rate, reproduction, adult body length, larval body length, and the activities of acetyl cholinesterase, catalase and superoxide dismutase on the F. candida. Namely, Bt maize had no toxic effects on the F. candida."
https://openalex.org/W3021102217,"Cassava is the 6th most important source of dietary energy in the world but its root system architecture (RSA) had seldom been quantified. Ability to select superior genotypes at juvenile stages can significantly reduce the cost and time for breeding to bridge the large yield gap. This study adopted a simple approach to phenotyping RSA traits of juvenile and mature cassava plants to identify genotypic differences and the relationships between juvenile traits and harvest index of mature plants. Root classes were categorised and root and shoot traits of eight (8) juvenile pot-grown cassava genotypes, were measured at 30 and 45 days after planting (DAP). The same or related traits were measured at 7 months after planting of the same genotypes grown in the field while yield and yield components were measured in 12-months old field-grown plants. The field experiment was done in 2017 and repeated in 2018. Differences between genotypes for the measured traits were explored using analysis of variance (ANOVA) while traits in juvenile plants were correlated or regressed onto traits measured in 7- and 12-months old plants. The results show significant genotypic variations for most of the traits measured in both juvenile and 7-months old plants. In the 12-months old plants, differences between genotypes were consistent for both 2017 and 2018. Broad-sense heritability was highest for the number of commercial roots (0.87) and shoot fresh weight (0.78) and intermediate for the total number of roots (0.60), harvest index (0.58), fresh weight of roots (0.45). For all the sampling time points or growth stages, there were greater correlations between traits measured at a particular growth stage than between the same traits at different growth stages. However, some juvenile-mature plant trait relationships were significant, positive and consistent for both 2017 and 2018. For example, total root length and the total number of roots in 30 DAP, and branching density of upper nodal roots in 45 DAP, positively correlated with harvest index of 12-months old plants in both 2017 and 2018. Similarly, the diameter of nodal roots, for example, had a negative, significant correlation with fresh shoot biomass of mature plants in both 2017 and 2018. Regression of traits measured in 30 DAP explained up to 22% and 36% of the variation in HI of mature plants in 2017 and 2018, respectively. It is concluded that the simple, rapid, inexpensive phenotyping approach adopted in this study is robust for identifying genotypic variations in juvenile cassava using root system traits. Also, the results provide seminal evidence for the existence of useful relationships between traits of juvenile and mature cassava plants that can be explored to predict yield and yield components."
https://openalex.org/W3021999341,"Thermal discharge from a nuclear power plant (NPP) provides an opportunity to foresee changes in faunal communities that may be induced by ocean warming. I assessed these changes by identifying characteristics of the fish community near the thermal discharge from a NPP and by recording temporal changes that occurred after the suspension of the NPP. Underwater visual censuses were conducted near Takahama NPP in the Sea of Japan, and fish assemblages were compared to those in two other sites: a site with discharge from a coal-fired power plant and a control site. During the surveyed period (8 years) when the NPP was in operation, the sea water temperature at the site near the NPP was warmer, had a significantly higher fish abundance, and a higher species richness, including tropical fishes, than the other two sites. However, once the NPP was suspended, tropical fishes dramatically decreased near the NPP. This abrupt change in fish assemblage may be due to the lowest lethal temperatures of tropical fishes being only slightly higher than the winter temperature in this area. Relatively poor ecosystem structure in the local warming area may also have contributed to low resilience of tropical fish species to this temperature change."
https://openalex.org/W3022137929,"Background 
Social networks have been shown to influence lifestyle behaviors in non-Latinx white (NLW) populations. We examined their influence in Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) women.


Methods 
We included 477 AANHPI women from the Asian Community Health Initiative Study who provided egocentric (degree, density, composition) and epidemiologic (size, types of ties) social network data and data on alcohol intake, physical activity, smoking, diet, and body size. We used logistic regression to evaluate associations of social network measures and dichotomous outcomes, and linear regression for continuous outcomes.


Results 
In multivariable-adjusted analyses, higher degree and/or proportion of friends were significantly related to higher Western diet, higher odds of any alcohol consumption, and lower odds of physical inactivity and body mass index (BMI)≥23 kg/m2. Additionally, a higher proportion of NLW in women’s networks was related to lower Asian diet but also lower waist size. Community participation was related to higher Western diet and lower Asian diet. By contrast, degree and/or proportion of relatives were positively related to BMI, waist size and to a higher odds of BMI≥23 kg/m2 and of ever smoking 100 cigarettes. Being married was related to fewer alcoholic drinks per week and higher Asian diet. A higher density of relationships with frequent contact was also associated with higher Asian diet.


Conclusions 
AANHPI women with larger proportions of friends and NLWs in their networks had more Western health behaviors and smaller body size. Norms for health behaviors and body size may be influenced by the size, composition, and structure of social networks, relevant to chronic disease prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3022427008,"Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is a conserved, multifunctional protein involved in numerous cellular processes in eukaryotes. Although the functions of TCTP have been investigated sporadically in animals, invertebrates, and plants, few lineage-specific activities of this molecule, have been reported. An exception is in Arabidopsis thaliana, in which TCTP (AtTCTP1) functions in stomatal closuer by regulating microtubule stability. Further, although the development of next-generation sequencing technologies has facilitated the analysis of many eukaryotic genomes in public databases, inter-kingdom comparative analyses using available genome information are comparatively scarce.To carry out inter-kingdom comparative analysis of TCTP, TCTP genes were identified from 377 species. Then phylogenetic analysis, prediction of protein structure, molecular docking simulation and molecular dynamics analysis were performed to investigate the evolution of TCTP genes and their binding proteins.A total of 533 TCTP genes were identified from 377 eukaryotic species, including protozoa, fungi, invertebrates, vertebrates, and plants. Phylogenetic and secondary structure analyses reveal lineage-specific evolution of TCTP, and inter-kingdom comparisons highlight the lineage-specific emergence of, or changes in, secondary structure elements in TCTP proteins from different kingdoms. Furthermore, secondary structure comparisons between TCTP proteins within each kingdom, combined with measurements of the degree of sequence conservation, suggest that TCTP genes have evolved to conserve protein secondary structures in a lineage-specific manner. Additional tertiary structure analysis of TCTP-binding proteins and their interacting partners and docking simulations between these proteins further imply that TCTP gene variation may influence the tertiary structures of TCTP-binding proteins in a lineage-specific manner.Our analysis suggests that TCTP has undergone lineage-specific evolution and that structural changes in TCTP proteins may correlate with the tertiary structure of TCTP-binding proteins and their binding partners in a lineage-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W3022464535,"kakusei is a non-coding RNA that is overexpressed in foraging bee brain. This study describes a possible role of the IEG kakusei during the daily foraging of honey bees. kakusei was found to be transiently upregulated within two hours during rewarded foraging. Interestingly, during unrewarded foraging the gene was also found to be up-regulated, but immediately lowered when food was not rewarded. Moreover, the kakusei overexpression was diminished within a very short time when the time schedule of feeding was changed. This indicates the potential role of kakusei on the motivation of learned reward foraging. These results provide evidence for a dynamic role of kakusei during for aging of bees, and eventually its possible involvement in learning and memory. Thus the kakusei gene could be used as search tool in finding distinct molecular pathways that mediate diverse behavioral components of foraging."
https://openalex.org/W3023030945,"In Mozambique, HIV counseling and testing (HCT) rates are low and the cascade (or continuum) of care is poor. Perhaps more importantly, low disclosure rates and low uptake of joint testing are also related to both (1) limitations on access to services and (2) the availability of trained staff. We describe the implementation and impact of a disclosure support implemented by peer educators (PE).Ten PEs, previously trained in basic HIV and post-test counseling, completed additional training on providing disclosure support for newly-diagnosed persons living with HIV (PLH).Of the 6,092 persons who received HCT, 677 (11.1%) tested positive. Any newly-diagnosed PLH who was tested when PEs were present (606 / 677) was approached about participating in the disclosure program; of these, 94.2% of PLH (n = 574) agreed to participate. Of these, at follow-up (between 1 day and 3 months later, depending on client inclination and availability) 91.9% (n = 528) said that they had disclosed their HIV infection, of whom 66.9% (n = 384) were female and 24.1% (n = 144) male. In turn, 92.7% of partners (n = 508) who had received HIV-related exposure information were tested; of these, 78.7% (n = 400) were found to be HIV-positive. Of the latter, 96.3% (n = 385) were then seen by health care providers and referred for further diagnosis and treatment.Supporting newly-diagnosed PLH is important both for their own health and that of others. For the newly-diagnosed, there are extensive challenges related to understanding the implications of their illness; social support from clinical care teams can be vital in planning and coping. Our study has shown that such support of PLH is also crucial to disclosure, in part via improving awareness of positive health implications for (and from) family, friends and other support networks."
https://openalex.org/W3021005936,"The Korean government has been providing financial support to open and operate the maternal hospital in Obstetrically Underserved Areas (OUAs) since 2011. Our study aims to assess the effectiveness of the government-support program for OUAs and to suggest future directions for it.We performed sequential-mixed method approach. Descriptive analyses and multi-level logistic regression were performed based on the 2015 Korean National Health Insurance claim data. Data for the qualitative analysis were obtained from in-depth interviews with health providers and mothers in OUAs.Descriptive analyses indicated that the share of babies born in the hospitals located in the area among total babies ever born from mothers residing in the area (Delivery concentration Index: DCI) was lower in government-supported OUAs than other areas. Qualitative analyses revealed that physical distance is no longer a barrier in current OUAs. Mothers travel to neighboring big cities to seek elective preferences only available at specialized maternal hospitals rather than true medical need. Increasing one-child families changed the mother's perception of pregnancy and childbirth, making them willing to pay for more expensive services. Concern about an emergency for mothers or infants, especially of high-risk mothers was also an important factor to make mothers avoid local government-supported hospitals. Adjusted multi-level logistic regression indicated that DCIs of government-supported OUAs were higher than the ones of their counterpart areas.Our results suggest that current OUAs do not reflect reality. Identification of true OUAs where physical distance is a real barrier to the use of obstetric service and focused investment on them is necessary. In addition, more sophisticated performance indicator other than DCI needs to be developed."
https://openalex.org/W3023532467,"Is it appropriate for scientists to engage in political advocacy? Some political critics of scientists argue that scientists have become partisan political actors with self-serving financial agendas. However, most scientists strongly reject this view. While social scientists have explored the effects of science politicization on public trust in science, little empirical work directly examines the drivers of scientists' interest in and willingness to engage in political advocacy. Using a natural experiment involving the U.S. National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (NSF-GRF), we causally estimate for the first time whether scientists who have received federal science funding are more likely to engage in both science-related and non-science-related political behaviors. Comparing otherwise similar individuals who received or did not receive NSF support, we find that scientists' preferences for political advocacy are not shaped by receiving government benefits. Government funding did not impact scientists' support of the 2017 March for Science nor did it shape the likelihood that scientists donated to either Republican or Democratic political groups. Our results offer empirical evidence that scientists' political behaviors are not motivated by self-serving financial agendas. They also highlight the limited capacity of even generous government support programs to increase civic participation by their beneficiaries."
