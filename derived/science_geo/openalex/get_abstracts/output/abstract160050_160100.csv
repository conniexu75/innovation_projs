https://openalex.org/W2134377844,"Circadian rhythms of behavior are driven by oscillators in the brain that are coupled to the environmental light cycle. Circadian rhythms of gene expression occur widely in peripheral organs. It is unclear how these multiple rhythms are coupled together to form a coherent system. To study such coupling, we investigated the effects of cycles of food availability (which exert powerful entraining effects on behavior) on the rhythms of gene expression in the liver, lung, and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). We used a transgenic rat model whose tissues express luciferase in vitro. Although rhythmicity in the SCN remained phase-locked to the light-dark cycle, restricted feeding rapidly entrained the liver, shifting its rhythm by 10 hours within 2 days. Our results demonstrate that feeding cycles can entrain the liver independently of the SCN and the light cycle, and they suggest the need to reexamine the mammalian circadian hierarchy. They also raise the possibility that peripheral circadian oscillators like those in the liver may be coupled to the SCN primarily through rhythmic behavior, such as feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2121847288,"Circadian oscillations in mammalian physiology and behavior are regulated by an endogenous biological clock. Here we show that loss of the PAS protein MOP3 (also known as BMAL1) in mice results in immediate and complete loss of circadian rhythmicity in constant darkness. Additionally, locomotor activity in light–dark (LD) cycles is impaired and activity levels are reduced in Mop3−/− mice. Analysis of Period gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) indicates that these behavioral phenotypes arise from loss of circadian function at the molecular level. These results provide genetic evidence that MOP3 is the bona fide heterodimeric partner of mCLOCK. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that MOP3 is a nonredundant and essential component of the circadian pacemaker in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2007203236,"Interpenetration (catenation) has long been considered a major impediment in the achievement of stable and porous crystalline structures. A strategy for the design of highly porous and structurally stable networks makes use of metal-organic building blocks that can be assembled on a triply periodic P -minimal geometric surface to produce structures that are interpenetrating—more accurately considered as interwoven. We used 4,4′,4""-benzene-1,3,5-triyl-tribenzoic acid (H 3 BTB), copper(II) nitrate, and N , N ′-dimethylformamide (DMF) to prepare Cu 3 (BTB) 2 (H 2 O) 3 ·(DMF) 9 (H 2 O) 2 (MOF-14), whose structure reveals a pair of interwoven metal-organic frameworks that are mutually reinforced. The structure contains remarkably large pores, 16.4 angstroms in diameter, in which voluminous amounts of gases and organic solvents can be reversibly sorbed."
https://openalex.org/W1964180982,"The molecular basis for the anti-inflammatory property of intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) was investigated in a murine model of immune thrombocytopenia. Administration of clinically protective doses of intact antibody or monomeric Fc fragments to wild-type or Fcγ receptor–humanized mice prevented platelet consumption triggered by a pathogenic autoantibody. The inhibitory Fc receptor, FcγRIIB, was required for protection, because disruption either by genetic deletion or with a blocking monoclonal antibody reversed the therapeutic effect of IVIG. Protection was associated with the ability of IVIG administration to induce surface expression of FcγRIIB on splenic macrophages. Modulation of inhibitory signaling is thus a potent therapeutic strategy for attenuating autoantibody-triggered inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2026238074,"Transposon inactivation of Arabidopsis MAP kinase 4 produced the mpk4 mutant exhibiting constitutive systemic acquired resistance (SAR) including elevated salicylic acid (SA) levels, increased resistance to virulent pathogens, and constitutive pathogenesis-related gene expression shown by Northern and microarray hybridizations. MPK4 kinase activity is required to repress SAR, as an inactive MPK4 form failed to complement mpk4. Analysis of mpk4 expressing the SA hydroxylase NahG and of mpk4/npr1 double mutants indicated that SAR expression in mpk4 is dependent upon elevated SA levels but is independent of NPR1. PDF1.2 and THI2.1 gene induction by jasmonate was blocked in mpk4 expressing NahG, suggesting that MPK4 is required for jasmonic acid-responsive gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2116777154,"We have used the recently determined atomic structure of the 30S ribosomal subunit to determine the structures of its complexes with the antibiotics tetracycline, pactamycin, and hygromycin B. The antibiotics bind to discrete sites on the 30S subunit in a manner consistent with much but not all biochemical data. For each of these antibiotics, interactions with the 30S subunit suggest a mechanism for its effects on ribosome function."
https://openalex.org/W2080764544,"We report a nanoscale ""lost-wax"" method for forming colloids with size distributions around 5% and their corresponding colloidal crystals. Macroporous polymer templates are first prepared from a silica colloidal crystal. We then use the uniform and interconnected voids of the porous polymer to generate a wide variety of highly monodisperse inorganic, polymeric, and metallic solid and core-shell colloids, as well as hollow colloids with controllable shell thickness, as colloidal crystals. We can also uniformly deform the polymer template to alter colloidal shape and demonstrate the formation of elliptical particles with precisely controlled aspect ratios."
https://openalex.org/W1992616661,"We demonstrate coupling and entangling of quantum states in a pair of vertically aligned, self-assembled quantum dots by studying the emission of an interacting electron-hole pair (exciton) in a single dot molecule as a function of the separation between the dots. An interaction-induced energy splitting of the exciton is observed that exceeds 30 millielectron volts for a dot layer separation of 4 nanometers. The results are interpreted by mapping the tunneling of a particle in a double dot to the problem of a single spin. The electron-hole complex is shown to be equivalent to entangled states of two interacting spins."
https://openalex.org/W2001192666,"Tpl2 knockout mice produce low levels of TNF-alpha when exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and they are resistant to LPS/D-Galactosamine-induced pathology. LPS stimulation of peritoneal macrophages from these mice did not activate MEK1, ERK1, and ERK2 but did activate JNK, p38 MAPK, and NF-kappaB. The block in ERK1 and ERK2 activation was causally linked to the defect in TNF-alpha induction by experiments showing that normal murine macrophages treated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 exhibit a similar defect. Deletion of the AU-rich motif in the TNF-alpha mRNA minimized the effect of Tpl2 inactivation on the induction of TNF-alpha. Subcellular fractionation of LPS-stimulated macrophages revealed that LPS signals transduced by Tpl2 specifically promote the transport of TNF-alpha mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2011625746,"Adaptor protein 180 (AP180) and its homolog, clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein (CALM), are closely related proteins that play important roles in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Here, we present the structure of the NH2-terminal domain of CALM bound to phosphatidylinositol-4,5- bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] via a lysine-rich motif. This motif is found in other proteins predicted to have domains of similar structure (for example, Huntingtin interacting protein 1). The structure is in part similar to the epsin NH2-terminal (ENTH) domain, but epsin lacks the PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding site. Because AP180 could bind to PtdIns(4,5)P2 and clathrin simultaneously, it may serve to tether clathrin to the membrane. This was shown by using purified components and a budding assay on preformed lipid monolayers. In the presence of AP180, clathrin lattices formed on the monolayer. When AP2 was also present, coated pits were formed."
https://openalex.org/W2048443746,"Self-assembled monolayer chemistry was used in combination with either multistream laminar flow or photolithography to pattern surface free energies inside microchannel networks. Aqueous liquids introduced into these patterned channels are confined to the hydrophilic pathways, provided the pressure is maintained below a critical value. The maximum pressure is determined by the surface free energy of the liquid, the advancing contact angle of the liquid on the hydrophobic regions, and the channel depth. Surface-directed liquid flow was used to create pressure-sensitive switches inside channel networks. The ability to confine liquid flow inside microchannels with only two physical walls is expected to be useful in applications where a large gas-liquid interface is critical, as demonstrated here by a gas-liquid reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2098651037,"The Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) was an international, multiplatform field campaign to measure long-range transport of air pollution from South and Southeast Asia toward the Indian Ocean during the dry monsoon season in January to March 1999. Surprisingly high pollution levels were observed over the entire northern Indian Ocean toward the Intertropical Convergence Zone at about 6 degrees S. We show that agricultural burning and especially biofuel use enhance carbon monoxide concentrations. Fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning cause a high aerosol loading. The growing pollution in this region gives rise to extensive air quality degradation with local, regional, and global implications, including a reduction of the oxidizing power of the atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W1997808089,"We cloned and characterized a protein kinase and ion channel, TRP-PLIK. As part of the long transient receptor potential channel subfamily implicated in control of cell division, it is a protein that is both an ion channel and a protein kinase. TRP-PLIK phosphorylated itself, displayed a wide tissue distribution, and, when expressed in CHO-K1 cells, constituted a nonselective, calcium-permeant, 105-picosiemen, steeply outwardly rectifying conductance. The zinc finger containing alpha-kinase domain was functional. Inactivation of the kinase activity by site-directed mutagenesis and the channel's dependence on intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) demonstrated that the channel's kinase activity is essential for channel function."
https://openalex.org/W2075626786,"Bcl10, a CARD-containing protein identified from the t(1;14)(p22;q32) breakpoint in MALT lymphomas, has been shown to induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappaB in vitro. We show that one-third of bcl10-/- embryos developed exencephaly, leading to embryonic lethality. Surprisingly, bcl10-/- cells retained susceptibility to various apoptotic stimuli in vivo and in vitro. However, surviving bcl10-/- mice were severely immunodeficient and bcl10-/- lymphocytes are defective in antigen receptor or PMA/Ionomycin-induced activation. Early tyrosine phosphorylation, MAPK and AP-1 activation, and Ca2+ signaling were normal in mutant lymphocytes, but antigen receptor-induced NF-kappaB activation was absent. Thus, Bcl10 functions as a positive regulator of lymphocyte proliferation that specifically connects antigen receptor signaling in B and T cells to NF-kappaB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2117521691,"We cloned the C. elegans gene ced-1, which is required for the engulfment of cells undergoing programmed cell death. ced-1 encodes a transmembrane protein similar to human SREC (Scavenger Receptor from Endothelial Cells). We showed that ced-1 is expressed in and functions in engulfing cells. The CED-1 protein localizes to cell membranes and clusters around neighboring cell corpses. CED-1 failed to cluster around cell corpses in mutants defective in the engulfment gene ced-7. Motifs in the intracellular domain of CED-1 known to interact with PTB and SH2 domains were necessary for engulfment but not for clustering. Our results indicate that CED-1 is a cell surface phagocytic receptor that recognizes cell corpses. We suggest that the ABC transporter CED-7 promotes cell corpse recognition by CED-1, possibly by exposing a phospholipid ligand on the surfaces of cell corpses."
https://openalex.org/W2102018304,"Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) rids eukaryotic cells of aberrant mRNAs containing premature termination codons. These are discriminated from true termination codons by downstream cis-elements, such as exon–exon junctions. We describe three novel human proteins involved in NMD, hUpf2, hUpf3a, and hUpf3b. While in HeLa cell extracts these proteins are complexed with hUpf1, in intact cells hUpf3a and hUpf3b are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins, hUpf2 is perinuclear, and hUpf1 cytoplasmic. hUpf3a and hUpf3b associate selectively with spliced β-globin mRNA in vivo, and tethering of any hUpf protein to the 3′UTR of β-globin mRNA elicits NMD. These data suggest that assembly of a dynamic hUpf complex initiates in the nucleus at mRNA exon–exon junctions and triggers NMD in the cytoplasm when recognized downstream of a translation termination site."
https://openalex.org/W182986896,"A structural, profile-based algorithm was used to identify interleukin 20 (IL-20), a novel IL-10 homolog. Chromosomal localization of IL-20 led to the discovery of an IL-10 family cytokine cluster. Overexpression of IL-20 in transgenic (TG) mice causes neonatal lethality with skin abnormalities including aberrant epidermal differentiation. Recombinant IL-20 protein stimulates a signal transduction pathway through STAT3 in a keratinocyte cell line, demonstrating a direct action of this ligand. An IL-20 receptor was identified as a heterodimer of two orphan class II cytokine receptor subunits. Both receptor subunits are expressed in skin and are dramatically upregulated in psoriatic skin. Taken together, these results demonstrate a role in epidermal function and psoriasis for IL-20, a novel cytokine identified solely by bioinformatics analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2005629845,"Increasing concentrations of ions flowing through the xylem of plants produce rapid, substantial, and reversible decreases in hydraulic resistance. Changes in hydraulic resistance in response to solution ion concentration, pH, and nonpolar solvents are consistent with this process being mediated by hydrogels. The effect is localized to intervessel bordered pits, suggesting that microchannels in the pit membranes are altered by the swelling and deswelling of pectins, which are known hydrogels. The existence of an ion-mediated response breaks the long-held paradigm of the xylem as a system of inert pipes and suggests a mechanism by which plants may regulate their internal flow regime."
https://openalex.org/W1992145745,"Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) has been developed to study transient structures in complex chemical reactions initiated with femtosecond laser pulses. This direct imaging of reactions was achieved using our third-generation apparatus equipped with an electron pulse (1.07 ± 0.27 picoseconds) source, a charge-coupled device camera, and a mass spectrometer. Two prototypical gas-phase reactions were studied: the nonconcerted elimination reaction of a haloethane, wherein the structure of the intermediate was determined, and the ring opening of a cyclic hydrocarbon containing no heavy atoms. These results demonstrate the vastly improved sensitivity, resolution, and versatility of UED for studying ultrafast structural dynamics in complex molecular systems."
https://openalex.org/W2139420483,"Synaptic vesicle fusion at synapses is triggered by increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels. However, the identity of the Ca2+ sensor and the transduction mechanism of the Ca2+ trigger are unknown. We show that Complexins, stoichiometric components of the exocytotic core complex, are important regulators of transmitter release at a step immediately preceding vesicle fusion. Neurons lacking Complexins show a dramatically reduced transmitter release efficiency due to decreased Ca2+ sensitivity of the synaptic secretion process. Analyses of mutant neurons demonstrate that Complexins are acting at or following the Ca2+-triggering step of fast synchronous transmitter release by regulating the exocytotic Ca2+ sensor, its interaction with the core complex fusion machinery, or the efficiency of the fusion apparatus itself."
https://openalex.org/W1977951612,"Endocytic proteins such as epsin, AP180, and Hip1R (Sla2p) share a conserved modular region termed the epsin NH2-terminal homology (ENTH) domain, which plays a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis through an unknown target. Here, we demonstrate a strong affinity of the ENTH domain for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2]. With nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the epsin ENTH domain, we determined that a cleft formed with positively charged residues contributed to phosphoinositide binding. Overexpression of a mutant, epsin Lys76 --> Ala76, with an ENTH domain defective in phosphoinositide binding, blocked epidermal growth factor internalization in COS-7 cells. Thus, interaction between the ENTH domain and PtdIns(4,5)P2 is essential for endocytosis mediated by clathrin-coated pits."
https://openalex.org/W2003742149,"The process of cellular differentiation culminating in terminally differentiated mammalian cells is thought to be irreversible. Here, we present evidence that terminally differentiated murine myotubes can be induced to dedifferentiate. Ectopic expression of msx1 in C2C12 myotubes reduced the nuclear muscle proteins MyoD, myogenin, MRF4, and p21 to undetectable levels in 20%–50% of the myotubes. Approximately 9% of the myotubes cleave to produce either smaller multinucleated myotubes or proliferating, mononucleated cells. Finally, clonal populations of the myotube-derived mononucleated cells can be induced to redifferentiate into cells expressing chondrogenic, adipogenic, myogenic, and osteogenic markers. These results suggest that terminally differentiated mammalian myotubes can dedifferentiate when stimulated with the appropriate signals and that msx1 can contribute to the dedifferentiation process."
https://openalex.org/W2004573678,"The current extinction of many of Earth's large terrestrial carnivores has left some extant prey species lacking knowledge about contemporary predators, a situation roughly parallel to that 10,000 to 50,000 years ago, when naive animals first encountered colonizing human hunters. Along present-day carnivore recolonization fronts, brown (also called grizzly) bears killed predator-naive adult moose at disproportionately high rates in Scandinavia, and moose mothers who lost juveniles to recolonizing wolves in North America's Yellowstone region developed hypersensitivity to wolf howls. Although prey that had been unfamiliar with dangerous predators for as few as 50 to 130 years were highly vulnerable to initial encounters, behavioral adjustments to reduce predation transpired within a single generation. The fact that at least one prey species quickly learns to be wary of restored carnivores should negate fears about localized prey extinction."
https://openalex.org/W2083956747,"Bromine atoms are believed to play a central role in the depletion of surface-level ozone in the Arctic at polar sunrise. Br2, BrCl, and HOBr have been hypothesized as bromine atom precursors, and there is evidence for chlorine atom precursors as well, but these species have not been measured directly. We report here measurements of Br2, BrCl, and Cl2 made using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry at Alert, Nunavut, Canada. In addition to Br2 at mixing ratios up to approximately 25 parts per trillion, BrCl was found at levels as high as approximately 35 parts per trillion. Molecular chlorine was not observed, implying that BrCl is the dominant source of chlorine atoms during polar sunrise, consistent with recent modeling studies. Similar formation of bromine compounds and tropospheric ozone destruction may also occur at mid-latitudes but may not be as apparent owing to more efficient mixing in the boundary layer."
https://openalex.org/W2126912336,"“Limited control” models of reproductive skew in cooperative societies suggest that the frequency of breeding by subordinates is determined by the outcome of power struggles with dominants. In contrast, “optimal skew” models suggest that dominants have full control of subordinate reproduction and allow subordinates to breed only when this serves to retain subordinates' assistance with rearing dominants' own litters. The results of our 7-year field study of cooperative meerkats, Suricata suricatta , support the predictions of limited control models and provide no indication that dominant females grant reproductive concessions to subordinates to retain their assistance with future breeding attempts."
https://openalex.org/W1980337975,"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) controls osteoblast proliferation and differentiation through Smad proteins. Here we show that Tob, a member of the emerging family of antiproliferative proteins, is a negative regulator of BMP/Smad signaling in osteoblasts. Mice carrying a targeted deletion of the tob gene have a greater bone mass resulting from increased numbers of osteoblasts. Orthotopic bone formation in response to BMP2 is elevated in tob-deficient mice. Overproduction of Tob represses BMP2-induced, Smad-mediated transcriptional activation. Finally, Tob associates with receptor-regulated Smads (Smad1, 5, and 8) and colocalizes with these Smads in the nuclear bodies upon BMP2 stimulation. The results indicate that Tob negatively regulates osteoblast proliferation and differentiation by suppressing the activity of the receptor-regulated Smad proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2112253639,"Large particles containing nitric acid (HNO3) were observed in the 1999/2000 Arctic winter stratosphere. These in situ observations were made over a large altitude range (16 to 21 kilometers) and horizontal extent (1800 kilometers) on several airborne sampling flights during a period of several weeks. With diameters of 10 to 20 micrometers, these sedimenting particles have significant potential to denitrify the lower stratosphere. A microphysical model of nitric acid trihydrate particles is able to simulate the growth and sedimentation of these large sizes in the lower stratosphere, but the nucleation process is not yet known. Accurate modeling of the formation of these large particles is essential for understanding Arctic denitrification and predicting future Arctic ozone abundances."
https://openalex.org/W1987950952,"The requirement for processing glycolipid antigens in T cell recognition was examined with mouse CD1d-mediated responses to glycosphingolipids (GSLs). Although some disaccharide GSL antigens can be recognized without processing, the responses to three other antigens, including the disaccharide GSL Gal(α1→2)GalCer (Gal, galactose; GalCer, galactosylceramide), required removal of the terminal sugars to permit interaction with the T cell receptor. A lysosomal enzyme, α-galactosidase A, was responsible for the processing of Gal(α1→2)GalCer to generate the antigenic monosaccharide epitope. These data demonstrate a carbohydrate antigen processing system analogous to that used for peptides and an ability of T cells to recognize processed fragments of complex glycolipids."
https://openalex.org/W1983712701,"The orderly reduction in chromosome number that occurs during meiosis depends on two aspects of chromosome behavior specific to the first meiotic division. These are the retention of cohesion between sister centromeres and their attachment to microtubules that extend to the same pole (monopolar attachment). By deleting genes that are upregulated during meiosis, we identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae a kinetochore associated protein, Mam1 (Monopolin), which is essential for monopolar attachment. We also show that the meiosis-specific cohesin, Rec8, is essential for maintaining cohesion between sister centromeres but not for monopolar attachment. We conclude that monopolar attachment during meiosis I requires at least one meiosis-specific protein and is independent of the process that protects sister centromere cohesion."
https://openalex.org/W1983075472,"Slit is secreted by midline glia in Drosophila and functions as a short-range repellent to control midline crossing. Although most Slit stays near the midline, some diffuses laterally, functioning as a long-range chemorepellent. Here we show that a combinatorial code of Robo receptors controls lateral position in the CNS by responding to this presumptive Slit gradient. Medial axons express only Robo, intermediate axons express Robo3 and Robo, while lateral axons express Robo2, Robo3, and Robo. Removal of robo2 or robo3 causes lateral axons to extend medially; ectopic expression of Robo2 or Robo3 on medial axons drives them laterally. Precise topography of longitudinal pathways appears to be controlled by a combination of long-range guidance (the Robo code determining region) and short-range guidance (discrete local cues determining specific location within a region)."
https://openalex.org/W2051656608,"On each side of the midline of the Drosophila CNS, axons are organized into a series of parallel pathways. Here we show that the midline repellent Slit, previously identified as a short-range signal that regulates midline crossing, also functions at long range to pattern these longitudinal pathways. In this long-range function, Slit signals through the receptors Robo2 and Robo3. Axons expressing neither, one, or both of these receptors project in one of three discrete lateral zones, each successively further from the midline. Loss of robo2 or robo3 function repositions axons closer to the midline, while gain of robo2 or robo3 function shifts axons further from the midline. Local cues further refine the lateral position. Together, these long- and short-range guidance cues allow growth cones to select with precision a specific longitudinal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2123331216,"ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities participate in the alteration of chromatin structure during gene regulation. All have DNA- or chromatin-stimulated ATPase activity and many can alter the structure of chromatin; however, the means by which they do this have remained unclear. Here we describe a novel activity for ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities, the ability to generate unconstrained negative superhelical torsion in DNA and chromatin. We find that the ability to distort DNA is shared by the yeast SWI/SNF complex, Xenopus Mi-2 complex, recombinant ISWI, and recombinant BRG1, suggesting that the generation of superhelical torsion represents a primary biomechanical activity shared by all Snf2p-related ATPase motors. The generation of superhelical torque provides a potent means by which ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities can manipulate chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W2045738040,"Bidirectional signaling between neocortex and limbic cortex has been hypothesized to contribute to the retrieval of long-term memory. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the time courses of perceptual and memory-retrieval signals in two neighboring areas in temporal cortex, area TE (TE) and perirhinal cortex (PRh), while monkeys were performing a visual pair-association task. Perceptual signal reached TE before PRh, confirming its forward propagation. In contrast, memory-retrieval signal appeared earlier in PRh, and TE neurons were then gradually recruited to represent the sought target. A reasonable interpretation of this finding is that the rich backward fiber projections from PRh to TE may underlie the activation of TE neurons that represent a visual object retrieved from long-term memory."
https://openalex.org/W2057708838,"Steroid hormones are key regulators of numerous physiological and developmental processes, including metastasis of breast and ovarian cancer. Here we report the identification of a Drosophila gene, named taiman, which encodes a steroid hormone receptor coactivator related to AIB1. Mutations in tai caused defects in the migration of specific follicle cells, the border cells, in the Drosophila ovary. Mutant cells exhibited abnormal accumulation of E-cadherin, β-catenin, and focal adhesion kinase. TAI protein colocalized with the ecdysone receptor in vivo and augmented transcriptional activation by the ecdysone receptor in cultured cells. The finding of this type of coactivator required for cell motility suggests a novel role for steroid hormones, in stimulating invasive cell behavior, independent of effects on proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2124521784,"The transmembrane ligand ephrinB2 and its cognate Eph receptor tyrosine kinases are important regulators of vascular morphogenesis. EphrinB2 may have an active signaling role, resulting in bi-directional signal transduction downstream of both ephrinB2 and Eph receptors. To separate the ligand and receptor-like functions of ephrinB2 in mice, we replaced the endogenous gene by cDNAs encoding either carboxyterminally truncated (ephrinB2(DeltaC)) or, as a control, full-length ligand (ephrinB2(WT)). While homozygous ephrinB2(WT/WT) animals were viable and fertile, loss of the ephrinB2 cytoplasmic domain resulted in midgestation lethality similar to ephrinB2 null mutants (ephrinB2(KO)). The truncated ligand was sufficient to restore guidance of migrating cranial neural crest cells, but ephrinB2(DeltaC/DeltaC) embryos showed defects in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis very similar to those observed in ephrinB2(KO/KO) animals. Our results indicate distinct requirements of functions mediated by the ephrinB carboxyterminus for developmental processes in the vertebrate embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2027579998,"During Caenorhabditis elegans vulval development, a signal from the anchor cell stimulates the RTK/RAS/MAPK (receptor tyrosine kinase/RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway in the closest vulval precursor cell P6.p to induce the primary fate. A lateral signal from P6.p then activates the Notch signaling pathway in the neighboring cells P5.p and P7.p to prevent them from adopting the primary fate and to specify the secondary fate. The MAP kinase phosphatase LIP-1 mediates this lateral inhibition of the primary fate. LIN-12/NOTCH up-regulates lip-1 transcription in P5.p and P7.p where LIP-1 inactivates the MAP kinase to inhibit primary fate specification. LIP-1 thus links the two signaling pathways to generate a pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2087594396,"A model has been proposed for the regulation of CD45, and by homology other RPTPs, in which dimerization inhibits phosphatase activity through symmetrical interactions between an inhibitory structural wedge and the catalytic site. Here, we report the phenotype of mice with a single point mutation, glutamate 613 to arginine, that inactivates the inhibitory wedge of CD45. The CD45 E613R mutation causes polyclonal lymphocyte activation leading to lymphoproliferation and severe autoimmune nephritis with autoantibody production, resulting in death. Both homozygotes and heterozygotes develop pathology, indicating genetic dominance of CD45 E613R. The dramatic phenotype of CD45 E613R mice demonstrates the in vivo importance of negative regulation of CD45 by dimerization, supporting the model for regulation of CD45, and RPTPs in general."
https://openalex.org/W2134622777,"The functions of JunB during myelopoiesis were studied in vivo. Transgenic mice specifically lacking JunB expression in the myeloid lineage (junB−/−Ubi-junB mice) develop a transplantable myeloproliferative disease eventually progressing to blast crisis, which resembles human chronic myeloid leukemia. Similarly, mice reconstituted with ES cell-derived junB−/− fetal liver cells also develop a myeloproliferative disease. In both cases, the absence of JunB expression results in increased numbers of granulocyte progenitors, which display enhanced GM-CSF-mediated proliferation and extended survival, associated with changes in the expression levels of the GM-CSF α receptor, the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and Bclx, and the cell cycle regulators p16INK4a and c-Jun. Importantly, ectopic expression of JunB fully reverts the immature and hyperproliferative phenotype of JunB-deficient myeloid cells. These results identify JunB as a key transcriptional regulator of myelopoiesis and a potential tumor suppressor gene."
https://openalex.org/W2058834628,"Chromatin insulators are regulatory elements that block the action of transcriptional enhancers when interposed between enhancer and promoter. The Drosophila Suppressor of Hairy wing [Su(Hw)] protein binds the Su(Hw) insulator and prevents enhancer-promoter interaction by a mechanism that is not understood. We show that when two copies of the Su(Hw) insulator element, instead of a single one, are inserted between enhancer and promoter, insulator activity is neutralized and the enhancer-promoter interaction may instead be facilitated. This paradoxical phenomenon could be explained by interactions between protein complexes bound at the insulators."
https://openalex.org/W1998210025,"Chromatin boundary elements or insulators are believed to regulate gene activity in complex genetic loci by organizing specialized chromatin structures. Here, we report that the enhancer-blocking activity of the Drosophila suHw insulator is sensitive to insulator copy number and position. Two tandem copies of suHw were ineffective in blocking various enhancers from a downstream promoter. Moreover, an enhancer was blocked more effectively from a promoter by two flanking suHw insulators than by a single intervening one. Thus, insulators may modulate enhancer-promoter interactions by interacting with each other and facilitating the formation of chromatin loop domains."
https://openalex.org/W2026391901,"The dispersion of longitudinal acoustic phonons was measured by inelastic x-ray scattering in the hexagonal closed-packed (hcp) structure of iron from 19 to 110 gigapascals. Phonon dispersion curves were recorded on polycrystalline iron compressed in a diamond anvil cell, revealing an increase of the longitudinal wave velocity (VP) from 7000 to 8800 meters per second. We show that hcp iron follows a Birch law for VP, which is used to extrapolate velocities to inner core conditions. Extrapolated longitudinal acoustic wave velocities compared with seismic data suggest an inner core that is 4 to 5% lighter than hcp iron."
https://openalex.org/W2082272732,"Staphylococcus aureus can cause disease through the production of toxins. Toxin production is autoinduced by the protein RNAIII-activating protein (RAP) and by the autoinducing peptide (AIP), and is inhibited by RNAIII-inhibiting peptide (RIP) and by inhibitory AIPs. RAP has been shown to be a useful vaccine target site, and RIP and inhibitory AIPs as therapeutic molecules to prevent and suppress S. aureus infections. Development of therapeutic strategies based on these molecules has been hindered by a lack of knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which they activate or inhibit virulence. Here, we show that RAP specifically induces the phosphorylation of a novel 21-kDa protein, whereas RIP inhibits its phosphorylation. This protein was termed target of RAP (TRAP). The synthesis of the virulence regulatory molecule, RNAIII, is not activated by RAP in the trap mutant strain, suggesting that RAP activates RNAIII synthesis via TRAP. Phosphoamino acid analysis shows that TRAP is histidine-phosphorylated, suggesting that TRAP may be a sensor of RAP. AIPs up-regulate the synthesis of RNAIII also in trap mutant strains, suggesting that TRAP and AIPs activate RNAIII synthesis via distinct signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, TRAP phosphorylation is down-regulated in the presence of AIP, suggesting that a network of signal transduction pathways regulate S. aureus pathogenesis. Staphylococcus aureus can cause disease through the production of toxins. Toxin production is autoinduced by the protein RNAIII-activating protein (RAP) and by the autoinducing peptide (AIP), and is inhibited by RNAIII-inhibiting peptide (RIP) and by inhibitory AIPs. RAP has been shown to be a useful vaccine target site, and RIP and inhibitory AIPs as therapeutic molecules to prevent and suppress S. aureus infections.

In culture, the bacteria produce toxic exomolecules only when in higher densities, at the post-exponential phase of growth. In the early exponential phase, when in lower densities, the bacteria express surface molecules, such as fibronectin-binding proteins and fibrinogen-binding protein, that allow the bacteria to adhere to and colonize host cells. The ability of the bacteria to switch between expression of surface adhesion molecules and toxin exomolecules (1Lowy F.D. N. Engl. J.

It is hypothesized that RNAIII enables the bacteria to adhere to host cells when in low numbers but to disengage and spread when too crowded, thus allowing dissemination and establishment of the infection. RNAIII is encoded by the agr locus (6Novick R.P. Ross H.F. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Moghazeh S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3967-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) and regulates at least 15 genes coding for potential virulence factors. agrmutants are nonpathogenic and show a decreased synthesis of extracellular toxins and enzymes, such as α-, β-, and δ-hemolysin, leucocidin, lipase, hyaluronate lyase, and proteases, and at the same time an increased synthesis of adhesion molecules, coagulase, and protein A (2Abdelnour A.

Moghazeh S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 446-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The agr locus contains two divergent transcription units, RNAII and RNAIII, driven by the promoters P2 and P3, both of which are active only from the mid-exponential phase of growth (9Novick R.P.

RNAII contains four open reading frames: agrA, agrB, agrC, and agrD. TheagrA and agrC genes encode a classical two-component signal transduction pathway composed of the AgrC signal receptor and the AgrA response regulator. The agrD gene product is a propeptide that is processed and secreted through AgrB, which is an integral membrane protein. The resultant mature autoinducing peptide (AIP)1(10Mayville P. Ji G.

Novick R.P. Vandenesch F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), which in turn is thought to phosphorylate AgrA, leading to up-regulation of RNAIII synthesis (12Morfeldt E. Panova-Sapundjieva I. Gustafsson B. Arvidson S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 143: 195-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of RNAIII is regulated by a quorum sensing mechanism (13Kleerebezem M. Quadri L.E. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Molecules produced and secreted by the bacteria (autoinducers) accumulate, and when they reach a threshold concentration, RNAIII is synthesized. The autoinducers of RNAIII that have been described to date are the RNAIII-activating protein (RAP) (14Balaban N. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RAP is a ∼38-kDa protein containing the NH2-terminal sequence IKKYKPITN (16Balaban N. Singh B. Goldkorn R.T. Rasooly A. Torres J.V. Uziel O. Science. 2000; 287: 391aCrossref Google Scholar). The AIPs are octapeptides encoded by the agr, are processed from AgrD, and activate RNAIII by inducing the phosphorylation of their receptor AgrC. Interestingly, AIPs produced by some S. aureus strains inhibit the expression of agr in other strains, and the amino acid sequences of peptide and receptor (AgrC) are markedly different between such strains, suggesting a hypervariability-generating mechanism (18Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Science. 1997; 276: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of AIPs has suggested that they contain an unusual thiol ester-linked cyclic structure, which is absolutely necessary for full biological activity (10Mayville P. Ji G. Beavis R. Yang H. Goger M. Novick R.P. Muir T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). RNAIII synthesis can be inhibited by antibodies directed against RAP. Mice vaccinated with RAP were shown to be protected from a S. aureus infection. The protection level correlated with the titer of anti-RAP antibodies, suggesting that RAP is a promising vaccine candidate (15Balaban N. Goldkorn T. Nhan R.T. Dang L.B. Scott S. Ridgley R.M.

Science. 2000; 287: 391aCrossref Google Scholar) and has the sequence YSPXTNF, where X can be a cysteine, a tryptophan, or a modified amino acid. Both native RIP and a synthetic analogue YSPWTNF are extremely effective in inhibiting RNAIII synthesis in vitro and in suppressing S. aureus infections in vivo (15Balaban N. Goldkorn T. Nhan R.T. Dang L.B. Scott S. Ridgley R.M. Rasooly A. Wright S.C. Larrick J.W. Rasooly R. Carlson J.R. Science. 1998; 280: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar,20Balaban N. Cullor J.S. Hume E.B.

RIP (native or synthetic) has been shown to prevent S. aureus SD cellulitis in mice (15Balaban N. Goldkorn T. Nhan R.T. Dang L.B. Scott S. Ridgley R.M. Rasooly A. Wright S.C. Larrick J.W. Rasooly R. Carlson J.R. Science. 1998; 280: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Synthetic RIP has been shown to prevent keratitis (tested in rabbits against S. aureus8325-4), osteomyelitis (tested in rabbits against S. aureusMS), mastitis (tested in cows against S. aureus Newbould 305, AE-1, and environmental infections), and septic arthritis (tested in mice against S. aureus LS-1) (20Balaban N. Cullor J.S. Hume E.B. Medina-Acosta E. Vieira da Motta O. O'Callaghan R. Rossitto P.V. Shirtliff M.E. Serafim da Silveira L. Torres J.V. Peptides. 2000; 21: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These findings strongly evidence the potential value of RIP as a therapeutic agent. The therapeutic potential of inhibiting RNAIII synthesis was confirmed by Mayville et al. (10Mayville P. Ji G. Beavis R. Yang H. Goger M. Novick R.P. Muir T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that peptides (AIPs) that inhibit RNAIII synthesis in vitro do in fact inhibit S. aureus infections in vivo. Although the therapeutic potential of RAP, RIP, and inhibitory AIPs is not in dispute, many questions remain unanswered and hinder the development of vaccines and therapeutics. These include understanding the detailed mechanism by which RAP, RIP, and AIPs regulate RNAIII synthesis; the precise mutual interactions between RAP, RIP and AIPs; and the signal transduction pathway that leads to RNAIII synthesis and concludes in virulence. Because of the sequence similarity between the NH2-terminal sequence of RAP and RIP (YKPITN as compared with YSPXTN), and because RIP has been shown to compete with RAP on the activation of RNAIII synthesis, we hypothesized that RAP and RIP may bind to the same receptor, one as an agonist (RAP) and the other as an antagonist (RIP). To test this hypothesis, RIP derivatives were synthesized according to the putative NH2-terminal sequence of RAP and tested for their ability to inhibit RNAIII synthesis in vitro and for their ability to prevent S. aureus cellulitis in vivo. The results of these experiments indicate that the peptides most successful in inhibiting RNAIII synthesis and cellulitis were those that most resembled the NH2 terminus of RAP and contained the sequence YKPITN (16Balaban N. Singh B. Goldkorn R.T. Rasooly A. Torres J.V. Uziel O. Science. 2000; 287: 391aCrossref Google Scholar). These results further suggest that RAP and RIP may in fact act as an agonist (RAP) and an antagonist (RIP) to the same receptor. Here, we show that RAP activates and RIP inhibits the phosphorylation of a 21-kDa protein. We termed this protein target of RAP (TRAP). Amino acid sequence analysis of TRAP indicates that it is a 167-amino acid polypeptide that is unique to S. aureus. RAP does not activate RNAIII synthesis in a trap – mutant, suggesting that RAP activates RNAIII synthesis via TRAP. We also show here that the phosphorylation of TRAP is inhibited by AIP of self, which uses the agr signal transduction system to activate RNAIII synthesis. Taken together, our results indicate that thetrap and the agr signal transduction systems interact with one another, resulting in up-regulation of RNAIII synthesis and in a coordinated production of virulence factors. The bacterial strains used were as follows: wild type S. aureus strain RN6390B (ATCC 55620);agr-null S. aureus mutant strain RN6911 (6Novick R.P. Ross H.F. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B.

Science. 2000; 287: 391aCrossref Google Scholar); S. aureus strain RN4220, a mutant of the wild type S. aureus strain 8325-4 that is capable of accepting foreign DNA (21Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar); and S. aureus strain OU20, containing a disrupted trap, grown at 42 °C in the presence of 10 μg/ml erythromycin. Unless mentioned otherwise, all bacteria were grown in CY broth supplemented with β-glycerophosphate (21Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) at 37 °C with shaking from early exponential phase of growth. To purify RAP, RN6390B cells were grown to the post-exponential phase of growth. Growth culture was centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter to remove residual cells. The supernatant was lyophilized (FlexiDry MP lyophilizer) and resuspended in water to one-tenth of the original volume (total, 10×). 15 ml of 10× supernatant was applied to a 10-kDa cutoff membrane (Centriprep 10 (Amicon)). This enabled us both to concentrate the material further and to remove material that was smaller than 10 kDa. 1 ml of concentrated material greater than 10 kDa was washed twice in PBS by resuspending it in 15 ml of PBS and reconcentrating it on the Centriprep 10, and the material greater than 10 kDa was collected (>10); this material is usually at a concentration of 25×–40×. This material contained no AIP and was used for RAP/RIP or RAP/AIP competition assays (see below), as well as for the further purification of RAP. To further purify RAP, 600 μl of >10 were fractionated on a gel filtration column (Superose 12, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 1 mm phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2 (0.1× PBS), at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were concentrated to one-tenth of their original volume by lyophilization and tested for RNAIII by Northern blotting, as described below. Active gel filtration fraction (1 ml) was collected, and RAP was further purified by anion exchange chromatography (HPLC SynchroPak Q300, Keystone Scientific, Inc.) in water, pH 7.2. Bound material was eluted by a salt gradient of 0–1m NaCl in water in 1-ml fractions. 38-kDa RAP eluted at 0.75 m NaCl. Active fraction was lyophilized and resuspended in 100 μl of water (10× active fraction, or RAP). To test for activity, 50 μl of 10× active fraction (RAP) was applied to 450 μl of early exponential cells (containing about 2 × 109 cells) as described below. To partially purify AIP from RN6390B post-exponential culture supernatants or native RIP from RN833 post-exponential supernatants, cells were grown to the post-exponential phase of growth. Growth culture was centrifuged at 6000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter to remove residual cells. The supernatant was lyophilized (FlexiDry MP lyophilizer) and resuspended in water to one-tenth of the original volume. 15 ml of 10× concentrated supernatant was applied to a 3-kDa cutoff membrane (Centriprep 10 (Amicon)), and material smaller than 3 kDa (flow-through) was collected and used to test for activity. To test for activity, 50 μl of the flow-through was applied to 450 μl of early exponential cells (containing about 2 × 109 cells) as described below. S. aureus RN6390B cells (4 ml) were grown in CY/GP from log phase of growth (A 650 of 0.03) until early exponential phase of growth of A 650 of about 0.2 (equivalent to about 1 × 109 cells/ml). Cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 30 min or at 12,000 × g for 2 min. Supernatants were discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 0.9 ml of phosphate-free buffer (PFB) (20 mm KCl, 80 mmNaCl, 20 mm NH4Cl, 0.14 mmNa2SO4, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2 μm FeCl2, 0.4% glucose, 9 μg/ml thiamine, 0.8 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.25 mml-arginine, 0.21 mml-histidine, 0.62 mml-lysine, 0.13 mml-glutamic acid, 0.056 mmglycine, 0.32 mml-alanine, 0.46 mml-valine, 0.36 mml-isoleucine, 0.82 mml-proline, 0.016 mml-phenylalanine, 0.50 mml-serine, 0.34 mml-threonine, 0.016 mml-tyrosine, l-0.27 mm cystein, 0.21 mml-methionine, 0.13 mml-asparagine, 0.029 mm nicotinic acid, 0.13 mml-glutamine) and 28 μCi of radiolabeled orthophosphate (32P) (ICN Biochemicals). Cells were grown with shaking for 40 min at 37 °C in the presence of one of the following (prepared as described above): 50 μl of total post-exponential supernatant (total 10×, containing 80% AIP and 20% RAP (16Balaban N. Singh B. Goldkorn R.T. Rasooly A. Torres J.V. Uziel O. Science. 2000; 287: 391aCrossref Google Scholar)), 50 μl of AIP, 50 μl of RAP, and 50 μl of native RIP, with synthetic RIP (10 μg RIP/4 × 106 cells) or with 50 μl control buffer. For growth phase experiments, cells in PFB and 32P were grown for the times indicated. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 2 min at 12,000 × g, supernatants were removed, and cells pellets were washed once in PBS to remove unincorporated 32P. Radiolabeled cells were resuspended in 20 μl of 50 μg/ml lysostaphin in 10 mmTris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA for 10 min at room temperature, Laemmli sample buffer was added (without boiling), and the sample (total cell homogenate) was separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. The gel was autoradiographed, and the density of the bands was determined. The gel was then stained in Coomassie to ensure that equal amounts of protein were in fact loaded on the gel. For RAP/RIP or RAP/AIP competition experiments, 450 μl of cells in PFB and 32P prepared as described above were incubated with 50 μl of RAP (40× >10), which was partially purified from post-exponential supernatants (see above), together with 50, 25, and 12.5 μl of native RIP or AIP (prepared as described above), and the volume was adjusted to 550 μl with CY. Early exponential 6390B (450 μl) was grown with 50 μl of the sample in question (prepared as described above: RAP, AIP, total 10×, native RIP, CY, or PBS) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation (2 min at 12,000 × g), and RNA was purified as described below. If cells were incubated with synthetic RIP, the amount of peptide used was 10 μg/4 × 106 cells. Equal number of cells were resuspended in 50 μl of lysostaphin in TES buffer (200 μg/ml lysostaphin (Sigma) in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 20% sucrose) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. 50 μl of 2% SDS containing proteinase K (100 μg/ml) was added and vigorously vortexed for 1 min followed by 10 min of incubation at room temperature. The sample was frozen and thawed twice. 15 μl of RNA sample was mixed with 11% deionized glyoxal, 16 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 55% Me2SO (final concentrations) and incubated for 1 h at 65 °C. RNA loading buffer (Ambion) was added, and a sample (of about 5 × 108 cells) was applied to a 1% agarose gel in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, supplemented with 5 mm iodoacetic acid (Sigma). Gel was Northern blotted by dry transfer and membrane-stained in methylene blue to view RNA and ensure that the same amounts of RNA were transferred. The membrane was prehybridized using Rapid-Hyb (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by hybridization with PCR-radiolabeled RNAIII-specific DNA (6Novick R.P. Ross H.F. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Moghazeh S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3967-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) or with PCR-radiolabeled 3′ trap (nt 400–550). The gels were autoradiographed, and the intensity of the band determined using a quantitative analysis program (Molecular Analyst). A cell pellet of 500 ml of early exponential S. aureus cells (grown as described above) was resuspended in 30 ml of PFB, 560 μCi of32P, and 3 ml of RAP and grown for 1 h with shaking at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed in PBS, resuspended in 2.5 ml of water containing 100 μg/ml lysostaphin (Sigma), and incubated on ice for 20 min. 7.5 ml of water was added, and cells were further incubated on ice for 20 min and disrupted by extensive sonication (Sonic Dismembrator, Fisher Scientific, microtip probe) (three times for 10 s each time on ice). Sonicated material was centrifuged (10 min at 12,000 × g), and soluble material was collected. Soluble material was concentrated by lyophilization (Savant, Speedvac Plus SC110A) to 800 μl. Material was fractionated on a gel filtration HPLC column (Bio-Sil SEC-125 300 × 7.8 mm, Bio-Rad) in 1 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 1-ml fractions were collected and tested for radioactivity in a scintillation counter (Beckman, LS600 multipurpose scintillation counter). Samples containing high cpm in comparison with the rest of the fractions were selected, separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and gel autoradiographed. The fraction containing the radiolabeled 21-kDa protein (phosphorylated TRAP) was used to further purify TRAP by anion exchange chromatography (HPLC SynchroPak Q300, Keystone Scientific, Inc.) in 0.1× PBS, pH 7.5. Bound material was eluted by a salt gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 0.1× PBS, pH 7.5. Fractions containing high cpm were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and gel autoradiographed to determine the fraction containing TRAP. Phosphorylated TRAP eluted at 0.75m NaCl. The 21-kDa radioactive band was cut and submitted for amino acid sequencing (see below). The anion exchange TRAP-containing fraction was applied to SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained in Coomassie and autoradiographed. The protein band corresponding to phosphorylation was cut and NH2-terminally sequenced or subjected to tryptic digestion for acquiring internal sequences. Specifically, the gel was dried, rehydrated in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, and incubated with 0.5 μg of trypsin overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted by 70% acetonitrile/5% formic acid and fractionated on a C18 HPLC (Vydac, 4.6 × 25 cm) in 0.1% TFA. Peptides were eluted on a 115-min gradient of 0–70% acetonitrile. Peptides were collected and amino acid sequenced commercially by Edman degradation chemistry (ABI 477 sequencer, Protein Structure Laboratory, UC Davis). Sequences were compared with the S. aureus Genome Sequencing Project data base, and the sequence of TRAP was determined. Primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene were constructed, trap was amplified by PCR, and the DNA sequence was confirmed. An internal 317-bp fragment () of the trap gene was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 1) 5′-CGCGCGGATCCCAACTATTCCAATTTTCAG-3′ (containing theBamHI site), and 2) 5′-CGCGAAGCTTCTTAAAGTCTTCGTATG-3′ (containing the HindIII site). The amplified PCR fragment was cloned into the BamHI/HindIII sites of the pAUL-A vector (kindly provided by S. Del-Cardayre), which is a shuttle vector between S. aureus and Escherichia coli. This plasmid contains an erythromycin resistance marker and carries a temperature-sensitive mutation at the S. aureus origin of replication, and therefore it is capable of replication in S. aureus cells only at the permissive temperature of 30 °C.S. aureus strain RN4220 cells (a restriction-deficient derivative of strain 8325-4 that is therefore capable of accepting foreign DNA (21Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar)) were transformed with the above construct by electroporation as described (22Schenk S. Laddaga R.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 94: 133-138Crossref Google Scholar), and transformants were grown on NYE agar (23Lee C.Y. Buranen S.L. Ye Z.H. Gene. 1991; 103: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) in the presence of 10 μg/ml erythromycin at the permissive temperature of 30 °C overnight. Transformants were grown on NYE agar in the presence of 10 μg/ml erythromycin at the restrictive temperature of 42 °C overnight. Colonies were analyzed for integration of the plasmid into the chromosome at the trapsite via a Campbell insertion process. The analysis was done by PCR, employing primers that are homologous to the plasmid region (universal reverse primer 5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′) and absent in the chromosome and a primer that is homologous to the pre-5′-end of thetrap gene and is not present on the plasmid construct (5′-GTGGTAATGACTAGTTTATCATCGT-3′ (nucleotides –59 to –34). A DNA fragment of 500 bp was generated using the above primers, indicating the integration of the plasmid and disruption of trap. TheS. aureus containing the disrupted trap gene was termed OU20. Of note is the fact that the trap gene was also inactivated in S. aureus 8325-4 and termed YG1. The phenotype of S. aureus, YG1, had a similar phenotype to that of OU20.2 Purified radiolabeled TRAP-P was applied to SDS-PAGE. Slices of acrylamide, containing labeled TRAP-P, were excised and submerged in 3 n KOH at 105 °C for 5 h. The resulting hydrolysate was diluted 25-fold with water containing internal standards of phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine. Phosphoamino acids were separated by ion-exchange chromatography (24Wei Y.F. Matthews H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 388-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).O-Phthalaldehyde w"
https://openalex.org/W2075848464,"Cryptochromes and phytochromes are the major photosensory receptors in plants and often regulate similar photomorphogenic responses. The molecular mechanisms underlying functional interactions of cryptochromes and phytochromes remain largely unclear. We have identified an Arabidopsis photomorphogenic mutant, sub1, which exhibits hypersensitive responses to blue light and far-red light. Genetic analyses indicate that SUB1 functions as a component of a cryptochrome signaling pathway and as a modulator of a phytochrome signaling pathway. The SUB1 gene encodes a Ca2+-binding protein that suppresses light-dependent accumulation of the transcription factor HY5."
https://openalex.org/W2065168710,"The motility of kinesin motors is explained by a “hand-over-hand” model in which two heads of kinesin alternately repeat single-headed and double-headed binding with a microtubule. To investigate the binding mode of kinesin at the key nucleotide states during adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis, we measured the mechanical properties of a single kinesin-microtubule complex by applying an external load with optical tweezers. Both the unbinding force and the elastic modulus in solutions containing AMP-PNP (an ATP analog) were twice the value of those in nucleotide-free solution or in the presence of both AMP-PNP and adenosine 5′-diphosphate. Thus, kinesin binds through two heads in the former and one head in the latter two states, which supports a major prediction of the hand-over-hand model."
https://openalex.org/W1779299603,"As electrons are injected at various energies into ferromagnetic material with their spin polarization vector perpendicular to the axis of the magnetization, we observe precessional motion of the spin polarization on the femtosecond time scale. Because of angular momentum conservation, the magnetization vector must precess as well. We show that spin injection will generate the precessional magnetization reversal in nanosized ferromagnetic bits. At reasonable injected current densities this occurs on the picosecond time scale."
https://openalex.org/W2004935918,"The crustal remnants of Earth's Archean continents have been shielded from mantle convection by thick roots of ancient mantle lithosphere. The precise time of crust-root coupling (tectosphere birth) is poorly known but is needed to test competing theories of continental plate genesis. Our mapping and geochronology of an impact-generated section through the Mesoarchean crust of the Kaapvaal craton indicates tectosphere birth at 3.08 +/- 0.01 billion years ago, roughly 0.12 billion years after crust assembly. Growth of the southern African mantle root by subduction processes occurred within about 0.2 billion years. The assembly of crust before mantle may be common to the tectosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2136969878,"Green line emission at 557.7 nanometers arising from the O( 1 S − 1 D) transition of atomic oxygen has been observed on the nightside of Venus with HIRES, the echelle spectrograph on the W. M. Keck I 10-meter telescope. We also observe optical emissions of molecular oxygen, consistent with the spectra from the Venera orbiters, but our green line intensity is so high that we cannot explain how it could be inconspicuous in the Venera spectra. An upper limit for the intensity of the O( 1 D − 3 P) oxygen red line at 630 nanometers has also been obtained. The large green/red ratio indicates that the source is not associated with the Venus ionosphere. An important conclusion is that observation of the green line in a planetary atmosphere is not an indicator of an atmosphere rich in molecular oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W2028882825,"We previously reported that alternative transcripts were initiated within the second intron of the human Galectin-3 gene (LGALS3). We now demonstrate that these transcripts arise from an internal gene embedded within LGALS3 and named galig (Galectin-3 internal gene). Tissue-specific expression of galig was assayed by screening of several human tissues. Contrary to LGALS3, galig appears to be tightly regulated and principally activated in leukocytes from peripheral blood. Cloning and characterization of galig transcripts revealed that they contain two out-of-frame overlapping open-reading frames (ORFs). Transfection of expression vectors encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) chimeras indicated that both ORFs could be translated in proteins unrelated to Galectin-3. The ORF1 polypeptide targets EGFP to cytosol and nucleus whereas ORF2 targets EGFP to mitochondria. These results revealed the exceptional genetic organization of the LGALS3 locus."
https://openalex.org/W2030495635,"In this month9s TechSite, Chester and Parcher discuss the concept of Unified Chromatography. Unlike the equipment and methods used in gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, which can limit the analysis of substances with their constraints of temperature and pressure, Unified Chromatography enables researchers to create a continuum from liquid to gas by manipulating the temperature and pressure to avoid the boiling region. This continuum, they believe, could increase the specificity and efficiency of separation techniques for gasses and liquids alike and spur the creation of instruments that maintain a mobile phase and analyze substances in various states."
