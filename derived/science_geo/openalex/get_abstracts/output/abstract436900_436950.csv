https://openalex.org/W2140986639,"Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons have important roles in adaptive and pathological brain functions related to reward and motivation. However, it is unknown whether subpopulations of VTA dopamine neurons participate in distinct circuits that encode different motivational signatures, and whether inputs to the VTA differentially modulate such circuits. Here we show that, because of differences in synaptic connectivity, activation of inputs to the VTA from the laterodorsal tegmentum and the lateral habenula elicit reward and aversion in mice, respectively. Laterodorsal tegmentum neurons preferentially synapse on dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens lateral shell, whereas lateral habenula neurons synapse primarily on dopamine neurons projecting to the medial prefrontal cortex as well as on GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid-containing) neurons in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus. These results establish that distinct VTA circuits generate reward and aversion, and thereby provide a new framework for understanding the circuit basis of adaptive and pathological motivated behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2050982262,"Antisense Uchl1, a long non-coding RNA that is an antisense transcript for the Uchl1 gene, upregulates UCHL1 protein levels through the combined action of an overlapping sequence at its 5′ end and an embedded SINEB2 element. Many of the RNAs transcribed from the genome have as yet no known function. One such long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is an antisense transcript for the ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (Uchl1) gene, which is involved in brain function and implicated in neurodegeneration. This study shows that the antisense Uchl1 lncRNA recognizes a short interspersed nuclear element, SINEB2, within the Uchl1 gene. Interaction of antisense Uchl1 with SINEB2 results in upregulation of UCHL1 expression at the translational level. Natural or synthetic antisense transcripts with embedded repetitive elements may prove useful as tools to increase translation of selected messenger RNAs, and may have potential as RNA therapeutics. Most of the mammalian genome is transcribed1,2,3. This generates a vast repertoire of transcripts that includes protein-coding messenger RNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and repetitive sequences, such as SINEs (short interspersed nuclear elements). A large percentage of ncRNAs are nuclear-enriched with unknown function4. Antisense lncRNAs may form sense–antisense pairs by pairing with a protein-coding gene on the opposite strand to regulate epigenetic silencing, transcription and mRNA stability5,6,7,8,9,10. Here we identify a nuclear-enriched lncRNA antisense to mouse ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (Uchl1), a gene involved in brain function and neurodegenerative diseases11. Antisense Uchl1 increases UCHL1 protein synthesis at a post-transcriptional level, hereby identifying a new functional class of lncRNAs. Antisense Uchl1 activity depends on the presence of a 5′ overlapping sequence and an embedded inverted SINEB2 element. These features are shared by other natural antisense transcripts and can confer regulatory activity to an artificial antisense to green fluorescent protein. Antisense Uchl1 function is under the control of stress signalling pathways, as mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin causes an increase in UCHL1 protein that is associated to the shuttling of antisense Uchl1 RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Antisense Uchl1 RNA is then required for the association of the overlapping sense protein-coding mRNA to active polysomes for translation. These data reveal another layer of gene expression control at the post-transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2047306805,"Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is responsible for nonshivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Upon activation by long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), UCP1 increases the conductance of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) to make BAT mitochondria generate heat rather than ATP. Despite being a member of the family of mitochondrial anion carriers (SLC25), UCP1 is believed to transport H(+) by an unusual mechanism that has long remained unresolved. Here, we achieved direct patch-clamp measurements of UCP1 currents from the IMM of BAT mitochondria. We show that UCP1 is an LCFA anion/H(+) symporter. However, the LCFA anions cannot dissociate from UCP1 due to hydrophobic interactions established by their hydrophobic tails, and UCP1 effectively operates as an H(+) carrier activated by LCFA. A similar LCFA-dependent mechanism of transmembrane H(+) transport may be employed by other SLC25 members and be responsible for mitochondrial uncoupling and regulation of metabolic efficiency in various tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1965322047,"The response of cortical neurons to a sensory stimulus is modulated by the context. In the visual cortex, for example, stimulation of a pyramidal cell's receptive-field surround can attenuate the cell's response to a stimulus in the centre of its receptive field, a phenomenon called surround suppression. Whether cortical circuits contribute to surround suppression or whether the phenomenon is entirely relayed from earlier stages of visual processing is debated. Here we show that, in contrast to pyramidal cells, the response of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons (SOMs) in the superficial layers of the mouse visual cortex increases with stimulation of the receptive-field surround. This difference results from the preferential excitation of SOMs by horizontal cortical axons. By perturbing the activity of SOMs, we show that these neurons contribute to pyramidal cells' surround suppression. These results establish a cortical circuit for surround suppression and attribute a particular function to a genetically defined type of inhibitory neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2053889945,"B cells regulate immune responses by producing antigen-specific antibodies. However, specific B-cell subsets can also negatively regulate T-cell immune responses, and have been termed regulatory B cells. Human and mouse regulatory B cells (B10 cells) with the ability to express the inhibitory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) have been identified. Although rare, B10 cells are potent negative regulators of antigen-specific inflammation and T-cell-dependent autoimmune diseases in mice. How B10-cell IL-10 production and regulation of antigen-specific immune responses are controlled in vivo without inducing systemic immunosuppression is unknown. Using a mouse model for multiple sclerosis, here we show that B10-cell maturation into functional IL-10-secreting effector cells that inhibit in vivo autoimmune disease requires IL-21 and CD40-dependent cognate interactions with T cells. Moreover, the ex vivo provision of CD40 and IL-21 receptor signals can drive B10-cell development and expansion by four-million-fold, and generate B10 effector cells producing IL-10 that markedly inhibit disease symptoms when transferred into mice with established autoimmune disease. The ex vivo expansion and reinfusion of autologous B10 cells may provide a novel and effective in vivo treatment for severe autoimmune diseases that are resistant to current therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2039558597,"Cancer cells exhibit several unique metabolic phenotypes that are critical for cell growth and proliferation. Specifically, they overexpress the M2 isoform of the tightly regulated enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM2), which controls glycolytic flux, and are highly dependent on de novo biosynthesis of serine and glycine. Here we describe a new rheostat-like mechanistic relationship between PKM2 activity and serine biosynthesis. We show that serine can bind to and activate human PKM2, and that PKM2 activity in cells is reduced in response to serine deprivation. This reduction in PKM2 activity shifts cells to a fuel-efficient mode in which more pyruvate is diverted to the mitochondria and more glucose-derived carbon is channelled into serine biosynthesis to support cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2075094914,"Mammalian two-pore channel proteins (TPC1, TPC2; TPCN1, TPCN2) encode ion channels in intracellular endosomes and lysosomes and were proposed to mediate endolysosomal calcium release triggered by the second messenger, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). By directly recording TPCs in endolysosomes from wild-type and TPC double-knockout mice, here we show that, in contrast to previous conclusions, TPCs are in fact sodium-selective channels activated by PI(3,5)P(2) and are not activated by NAADP. Moreover, the primary endolysosomal ion is Na(+), not K(+), as had been previously assumed. These findings suggest that the organellar membrane potential may undergo large regulatory changes and may explain the specificity of PI(3,5)P(2) in regulating the fusogenic potential of intracellular organelles."
https://openalex.org/W2050215536,"The morphological and functional development of the vertebrate nervous system is initially governed by genetic factors and subsequently refined by neuronal activity. However, fundamental features of the nervous system emerge before sensory experience is possible. Thus, activity-dependent development occurring before the onset of experience must be driven by spontaneous activity, but the origin and nature of activity in vivo remains largely untested. Here we use optical methods to show in live neonatal mice that waves of spontaneous retinal activity are present and propagate throughout the entire visual system before eye opening. This patterned activity encompassed the visual field, relied on cholinergic neurotransmission, preferentially initiated in the binocular retina and exhibited spatiotemporal correlations between the two hemispheres. Retinal waves were the primary source of activity in the midbrain and primary visual cortex, but only modulated ongoing activity in secondary visual areas. Thus, spontaneous retinal activity is transmitted through the entire visual system and carries patterned information capable of guiding the activity-dependent development of complex intra- and inter-hemispheric circuits before the onset of vision. In live neonatal mice, waves of spontaneous retinal activity are present and can propagate patterned information capable of guiding activity-dependent development of complex intra- and inter-hemispheric circuits throughout the visual system before the onset of vision (before eye opening). Previous work on in vitro preparations of developing retina tissue has revealed spontaneous waves of activity, thought to be important in the development of the visual system. Here, Michael Crair and colleagues use optical methods to demonstrate the existence of retinal waves in live neonatal mice, and to show how these waves of activity propagate through the visual system before eye-opening, to drive activity-dependent maturation of the system. This finding suggests that spontaneous neural activity sculpts wiring throughout the brain during fetal development, and that disruptions in this ongoing activity may play an important part in neurological disorders such as autism in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2131166914,"Arynes (aromatic systems containing, formally, a carbon-carbon triple bond) are among the most versatile of all reactive intermediates in organic chemistry. They can be 'trapped' to give products that are used as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, dyes, polymers and other fine chemicals. Here we explore a strategy that unites the de novo generation of benzynes-through a hexadehydro-Diels-Alder reaction-with their in situ elaboration into structurally complex benzenoid products. In the hexadehydro-Diels-Alder reaction, a 1,3-diyne is engaged in a [4+2] cycloisomerization with a 'diynophile' to produce the highly reactive benzyne intermediate. The reaction conditions for this simple, thermal transformation are notable for being free of metals and reagents. The subsequent and highly efficient trapping reactions increase the power of the overall process. Finally, we provide examples of how this de novo benzyne generation approach allows new modes of intrinsic reactivity to be revealed."

https://openalex.org/W2020127384,"Maternal inheritance of mtDNA is the rule in most animals, but the reasons for this pattern remain unclear. To investigate the consequence of overriding uniparental inheritance, we generated mice containing an admixture (heteroplasmy) of NZB and 129S6 mtDNAs in the presence of a congenic C57BL/6J nuclear background. Analysis of the segregation of the two mtDNAs across subsequent maternal generations revealed that proportion of NZB mtDNA was preferentially reduced. Ultimately, this segregation process produced NZB-129 heteroplasmic mice and their NZB or 129 mtDNA homoplasmic counterparts. Phenotypic comparison of these three mtDNA lines demonstrated that the NZB-129 heteroplasmic mice, but neither homoplasmic counterpart, had reduced activity, food intake, respiratory exchange ratio; accentuated stress response; and cognitive impairment. Therefore, admixture of two normal but different mouse mtDNAs can be genetically unstable and can produce adverse physiological effects, factors that may explain the advantage of uniparental inheritance of mtDNA."

https://openalex.org/W2083086786,"Despite decades of successful use of cytotoxic chemotherapy in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), the biological basis for its differential success among individuals and for the existence of a therapeutic index has remained obscure. Rather than taking a genetic approach favored by many, we took a functional approach to ask how differential mitochondrial readiness for apoptosis (""priming"") might explain individual variation in clinical behavior. We found that mitochondrial priming measured by BH3 profiling was a determinant of initial response to induction chemotherapy, relapse after remission, and requirement for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Differential priming between malignant myeloblasts and normal hematopoietic stem cells supports a mitochondrial basis to the therapeutic index for chemotherapy. BH3 profiling identified BCL-2 inhibition as a targeted strategy likely to have a useful therapeutic index. BH3 profiling refines predictive information provided by conventional biomarkers currently in use and thus may itself have utility as a clinical predictive biomarker. PAPERCLIP:"
https://openalex.org/W2095198940,"PIWI-family proteins and their associated small RNAs (piRNAs) act in an evolutionarily conserved innate immune mechanism to provide essential protection for germ-cell genomes against the activity of mobile genetic elements. piRNA populations comprise a molecular definition of transposons, which permits them to distinguish transposons from host genes and selectively silence them. piRNAs can be generated in two distinct ways, forming either primary or secondary piRNAs. Primary piRNAs come from discrete genomic loci, termed piRNA clusters, and seem to be derived from long, single-stranded precursors. The biogenesis of primary piRNAs involves at least two nucleolytic steps. An unknown enzyme cleaves piRNA cluster transcripts to generate monophosphorylated piRNA 5' ends. piRNA 3' ends are probably formed by exonucleolytic trimming, after a piRNA precursor is loaded into its PIWI partner. Secondary piRNAs arise during the adaptive 'ping-pong' cycle, with their 5' termini being formed by the activity of PIWIs themselves. A number of proteins have been implicated genetically in primary piRNA biogenesis. One of these, Drosophila melanogaster Zucchini, is a member of the phospholipase-D family of phosphodiesterases, which includes both phospholipases and nucleases. Here we produced a dimeric, soluble fragment of the mouse Zucchini homologue (mZuc; also known as PLD6) and show that it possesses single-strand-specific nuclease activity. A crystal structure of mZuc at 1.75 Å resolution indicates greater architectural similarity to phospholipase-D family nucleases than to phospholipases. Together, our data suggest that the Zucchini proteins act in primary piRNA biogenesis as nucleases, perhaps generating the 5' ends of primary piRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1984680116,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease caused by deficiency of the ubiquitous survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. To define the mechanisms of selective neuronal dysfunction in SMA, we investigated the role of SMN-dependent U12 splicing events in the regulation of motor circuit activity. We show that SMN deficiency perturbs splicing and decreases the expression of a subset of U12 intron-containing genes in mammalian cells and Drosophila larvae. Analysis of these SMN target genes identifies Stasimon as a protein required for motor circuit function. Restoration of Stasimon expression in the motor circuit corrects defects in neuromuscular junction transmission and muscle growth in Drosophila SMN mutants and aberrant motor neuron development in SMN-deficient zebrafish. These findings directly link defective splicing of critical neuronal genes induced by SMN deficiency to motor circuit dysfunction, establishing a molecular framework for the selective pathology of SMA."
https://openalex.org/W2069665015,"Summary RNase III Drosha initiates microRNA (miRNA) maturation by cleaving a primary miRNA transcript and releasing a pre-miRNA with a 2 nt 3′ overhang. Dicer recognizes the 2 nt 3′ overhang structure to selectively process pre-miRNAs. Here, we find that, unlike prototypic pre-miRNAs (group I), group II pre-miRNAs acquire a shorter (1 nt) 3′ overhang from Drosha processing and therefore require a 3′-end mono-uridylation for Dicer processing. The majority of let-7 and miR-105 belong to group II. We identify TUT7/ZCCHC6, TUT4/ZCCHC11, and TUT2/PAPD4/GLD2 as the terminal uridylyl transferases responsible for pre-miRNA mono-uridylation. The TUTs act specifically on dsRNAs with a 1 nt 3′ overhang, thereby creating a 2 nt 3′ overhang. Depletion of TUTs reduces let-7 levels and disrupts let-7 function. Although the let-7 suppressor, Lin28, induces inhibitory oligo-uridylation in embryonic stem cells, mono-uridylation occurs in somatic cells lacking Lin28 to promote let-7 biogenesis. Our study reveals functional duality of uridylation and introduces TUT7/4/2 as components of the miRNA biogenesis pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1975072114,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) negatively and post-transcriptionally regulate expression of multiple target genes to support anabolic pathways for bone formation. Here, we show that miR-218 is induced during osteoblast differentiation and has potent osteogenic properties. miR-218 promotes commitment and differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells by activating a positive Wnt signaling loop. In a feed forward mechanism, miR-218 stimulates the Wnt pathway by down-regulating three Wnt signaling inhibitors during the process of osteogenesis: Sclerostin (SOST), Dickkopf2 (DKK2), and secreted frizzled-related protein2 (SFRP2). In turn, miR-218 expression is up-regulated in response to stimulated Wnt signaling and functionally drives Wnt-related transcription and osteoblast differentiation, thereby creating a positive feedback loop. Furthermore, in metastatic breast cancer cells but not in normal mammary epithelial cells, miR-218 enhances Wnt activity and abnormal expression of osteoblastic genes (osteomimicry) that contribute to homing and growth of cells metastatic to bone. Thus, miR-218/Wnt signaling circuit amplifies both the osteoblast phenotype and osteomimicry-related tumor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2154774779,"Pathogenic simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection is associated with enteropathy, which likely contributes to AIDS progression. To identify candidate etiologies for AIDS enteropathy, we used next-generation sequencing to define the enteric virome during SIV infection in nonhuman primates. Pathogenic, but not nonpathogenic, SIV infection was associated with significant expansion of the enteric virome. We identified at least 32 previously undescribed enteric viruses during pathogenic SIV infection and confirmed their presence by using viral culture and PCR testing. We detected unsuspected mucosal adenovirus infection associated with enteritis as well as parvovirus viremia in animals with advanced AIDS, indicating the pathogenic potential of SIV-associated expansion of the enteric virome. No association between pathogenic SIV infection and the family-level taxonomy of enteric bacteria was detected. Thus, enteric viral infections may contribute to AIDS enteropathy and disease progression. These findings underline the importance of metagenomic analysis of the virome for understanding AIDS pathogenesis."

Interestingly, all three diseases juxtapose dysregulated intracellular signaling with altered metabolic state. Exactly which genetic factors define stable metabolic set points in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we show that hedgehog signaling rewires cellular metabolism. We identify a cilium-dependent Smo-Ca(2+)-Ampk axis that triggers rapid Warburg-like metabolic reprogramming within minutes of activation and is required for proper metabolic selectivity and flexibility. We show that Smo modulators can uncouple the Smo-Ampk axis from canonical signaling and identify cyclopamine as one of a new class of ""selective partial agonists,"" capable of concomitant inhibition of canonical and activation of noncanonical hedgehog signaling. Intriguingly, activation of the Smo-Ampk axis in vivo drives robust insulin-independent glucose uptake in muscle and brown adipose tissue. These data identify multiple noncanonical endpoints that are pivotal for rational design of hedgehog modulators and provide a new therapeutic avenue for obesity and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2168481427,"APOE4 is the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD) and synergistic effects with amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) suggest interactions among apoE isoforms and different forms of Aβ accumulation. However, it remains unclear how the APOE genotype affects plaque morphology, intraneuronal Aβ, soluble Aβ42, and oligomeric Aβ (oAβ), particularly in vivo. As the introduction of human APOE significantly delays amyloid deposition in transgenic mice expressing familial AD (FAD) mutations (FAD-Tg), 5xFAD-Tg mice, which exhibit amyloid deposition by age 2 months, were crossed with apoE-targeted replacement mice to produce the new EFAD-Tg mice. Compared with 5xFAD mice, Aβ deposition was delayed by ∼4 months in the EFAD mice, allowing detection of early changes in Aβ accumulation from 2-6 months. Although plaque deposition is generally greater in E4FAD mice, E2/E3FAD mice have significantly more diffuse and E4FAD more compact plaques. As a first report in FAD-Tg mice, the APOE genotypes had no effect on intraneuronal Aβ accumulation in EFAD mice. In E4FAD mice, total apoE levels were lower and total Aβ levels higher than in E2FAD and E3FAD mice. Profiles from sequential three-step extractions (TBS, detergent, and formic acid) demonstrated that the lower level of total apoE4 is reflected only in the detergent-soluble fraction, indicating that less apoE4 is lipoprotein-associated, and perhaps less lipidated, compared with apoE2 and apoE3. Soluble Aβ42 and oAβ levels were highest in E4FAD mice, although soluble apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 levels were comparable, suggesting that the differences in soluble Aβ42 and oAβ result from functional differences among the apoE isoforms. Thus, APOE differentially regulates multiple aspects of Aβ accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2127943293,"The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) constitute hetero-oligomeric machines that mediate topologically similar membrane-sculpting processes, including cytokinesis, retroviral egress, and multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis. Although ESCRT-III drives membrane remodeling that creates MVBs, its structure and the mechanism of vesicle formation are unclear. Using electron microscopy, we visualize an ESCRT-II:ESCRT-III supercomplex and propose how it mediates vesicle formation. We define conformational changes that activate ESCRT-III subunit Snf7 and show that it assembles into spiraling ∼9 nm protofilaments on lipid monolayers. A high-content flow cytometry assay further demonstrates that mutations halting ESCRT-III assembly block ESCRT function. Strikingly, the addition of Vps24 and Vps2 transforms flat Snf7 spirals into membrane-sculpting helices. Finally, we show that ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III coassemble into ∼65 nm diameter rings indicative of a cargo-sequestering supercomplex. We propose that ESCRT-III has distinct architectural stages that are modulated by ESCRT-II to mediate cargo capture and vesicle formation by ordered assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2106296386,"Parkin is recruited to defective mitochondria to promote degradation by an autophagy mechanism (mitophagy).VDACs specifically interact with Parkin on defective mitochondria and are required for efficient targeting of Parkin to mitochondria and subsequent mitophagy.VDACs recruit Parkin to defective mitochondria.A novel mechanistic aspect of Parkin-dependent mitophagy is proposed that may be relevant to Parkinson disease. Mutations in the ubiquitin ligase Parkin and the serine/threonine kinase PINK1 can cause Parkinson disease. Both proteins function in the elimination of defective mitochondria by autophagy. In this process, activation of PINK1 mediates translocation of Parkin from the cytosol to mitochondria by an unknown mechanism. To better understand how Parkin is targeted to defective mitochondria, we purified affinity-tagged Parkin from mitochondria and identified Parkin-associated proteins by mass spectrometry. The three most abundant interacting proteins were the voltage-dependent anion channels 1, 2, and 3 (VDACs 1, 2, and 3), pore-forming proteins in the outer mitochondrial membrane. We demonstrate that Parkin specifically interacts with VDACs when the function of mitochondria is disrupted by treating cells with the proton uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone. In the absence of all three VDACs, the recruitment of Parkin to defective mitochondria and subsequent mitophagy are impaired. Each VDAC is sufficient to support Parkin recruitment and mitophagy, suggesting that VDACs can function redundantly. We hypothesize that VDACs serve as mitochondrial docking sites to recruit Parkin from the cytosol to defective mitochondria."

Disruption of individual components of neural circuits by injury or disease can produce a cascade of deleterious secondary effects upon other networked neurons. It has been hypothesized that the chronic dysfunction of neuronal circuits may ultimately lead to degeneration of neurons within the network, both exacerbating the damage and masking the primary cause of the disorder (Palop and Mucke, 2010Palop J.J.

Identifying the molecular, cellular, and physiological basis of disease is central to understanding the adult motor neuron disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Rothstein, 2009Rothstein J.D. Current hypotheses for the underlying biology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Ann. Neurol. 2009; 65: S3-S9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the juvenile disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) (Burghes and Beattie, 2009Burghes A.H. Beattie C.E. Spinal muscular atrophy: why do low levels of survival motor neuron protein make motor neurons sick?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 597-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The genetics of ALS are complex, and only a minority of cases are due to the inheritance of mutations in a diverse range of genes. By contrast, SMA, the most common inherited cause of infant mortality (Pearn, 1978Pearn J. Incidence, prevalence, and gene frequency studies of chronic childhood spinal muscular atrophy.J. Med. Genet. 1978; 15: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), is both recessive and monogenic. Both ALS and SMA are characterized by motor neuron functional alterations and degeneration, which has focused research on cell-autonomous changes in motor neurons themselves. However, recent studies of ALS mouse models have identified contributions of other spinal cord cells such as astrocytes to disease pathology, suggesting that interactions between motor neurons and other partner cells may be an important contributing factor to motor neuron disease (Ilieva et al., 2009Ilieva H. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W. Non-cell autonomous toxicity in neurodegenerative disorders: ALS and beyond.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). SMA is caused by recessive mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene (Lefebvre et al., 1995Lefebvre S. Bürglen L. Reboullet S. Clermont O. Burlet P. Viollet L. Benichou B. Cruaud C.

Zeviani M. et al.Identification and characterization of a spinal muscular atrophy-determining gene.Cell. 1995; 80: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3006) Google Scholar) that are not compensated for by SMN2, a human-specific gene (Burghes and Beattie, 2009Burghes A.H. Beattie C.E. Spinal muscular atrophy: why do low levels of survival motor neuron protein make motor neurons sick?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 597-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Although SMN2 is almost identical to SMN1, nucleotide differences alter its splicing pattern, resulting in an ∼90% reduction of full-length SMN messenger RNA (mRNA) expression (Lorson et al., 1999Lorson C.L. Hahnen E. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. A single nucleotide in the SMN gene regulates splicing and is responsible for spinal muscular atrophy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A single nucleotide difference that alters splicing patterns distinguishes the SMA gene SMN1 from the copy gene SMN2.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Therefore, SMA is caused by low levels of SMN as opposed to the complete loss of SMN (Burghes and Beattie, 2009Burghes A.H. Beattie C.E. Spinal muscular atrophy: why do low levels of survival motor neuron protein make motor neurons sick?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 597-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). SMN is a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes linked to RNA metabolism (Pellizzoni, 2007Pellizzoni L. Chaperoning ribonucleoprotein biogenesis in health and disease.EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). SMN is ubiquitously expressed and has been highly conserved during evolution (Schmid and DiDonato, 2007Schmid A. DiDonato C.J. Animal models of spinal muscular atrophy.J. Child Neurol. 2007; 22: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In genetic model organisms, complete removal of SMN results in loss of cell viability. In contrast, the reduced level of SMN found in SMA patients does not appear to significantly perturb the majority of organ systems (Crawford and Pardo, 1996Crawford T.O. Pardo C.A. The neurobiology of childhood spinal muscular atrophy.Neurobiol. Dis. 1996; 3: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). However, SMA patients develop motor problems and muscle weakness—with the proximal limb and trunk muscles stereotypically being the most severely affected—progressing eventually to respiratory insufficiency and death (Swoboda et al., 2005Swoboda K.J. Prior T.W. Scott C.B. McNaught T.P. Wride M.C. Reyna S.P. Bromberg M.B. Natural history of denervation in SMA: relation to age, SMN2 copy number, and function.Ann. Neurol. 2005; 57: 704-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Postmortem studies show that SMA patients have pathologically abnormal motor neurons and evidence of motor neuron loss (Simic, 2008Simic G. Pathogenesis of proximal autosomal recessive spinal muscular atrophy.Acta Neuropathol. 2008; 116: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); however, it is currently unclear whether this is the primary origin of motor system dysfunction or a terminal consequence. Reduction of SMN to low levels—similar to the situation in human SMA—has been studied using several animal models (Schmid and DiDonato, 2007Schmid A. DiDonato C.J. Animal models of spinal muscular atrophy.J. Child Neurol. 2007; 22: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the SMA mouse model SMN-Δ7, death occurs 2 weeks after birth (Le et al., 2005Le T.T. Pham L.T. Butchbach M.E. Zhang H.L. Monani U.R. Coovert D.D. Gavrilina T.O. Xing L. Bassell G.J. Burghes A.H. SMNDelta7, the major product of the centromeric survival motor neuron (SMN2) gene, extends survival in mice with spinal muscular atrophy and associates with full-length SMN.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 845-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). This is accompanied by a modest loss of motor neurons; however, these mice have a profound early impairment of motor behavior well before this loss occurs (Park et al., 2010aPark G.H. Kariya S. Monani U.R. Spinal muscular atrophy: new and emerging insights from model mice.Curr. Neurol. Neurosci. Rep. 2010; 10: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Examination of the neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) of SMN-Δ7 mice reveals that most terminals are innervated, though some have structural abnormalities (Kariya et al., 2008Kariya S. Park G.H.

Embryonic motor axon development in the severe SMA mouse.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 2900-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). NMJ neurotransmission is aberrant in these mutants, with an ∼50% reduction in quantal content (Kariya et al., 2008Kariya S. Park G.H. Maeno-Hikichi Y. Leykekhman O. Lutz C. Arkovitz M.S.

Impaired synaptic vesicle release and immaturity of neuromuscular junctions in spinal muscular atrophy mice.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 842-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar); however, the high safety factor of the neuromuscular junction means that these terminals still produce normal muscle twitch tension (Ling et al., 2010Ling K.K. Lin M.Y. Zingg B. Feng Z. Ko C.P. Synaptic defects in the spinal and neuromuscular circuitry in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, given the early severe defects observed in the motor behavior of SMA mice, the disruption of motor neuron function is surprisingly modest. SMN mutant mice have been used to grossly assess the tissue requirements for SMN by both selective SMN rescue and depletion experiments. Expression of transgenic SMN throughout the nervous system and some muscles (Gavrilina et al., 2008Gavrilina T.O. McGovern V.L. Workman E. Crawford T.O. Gogliotti R.G. DiDonato C.J. Monani U.R. Morris G.E. Burghes A.H. Neuronal SMN expression corrects spinal muscular atrophy in severe SMA mice while muscle-specific SMN expression has no phenotypic effect.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 1063-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) or through central nervous system (CNS) virus delivery (Passini et al., 2010Passini M.A. Bu J. Roskelley E.M. Richards A.M. Sardi S.P. O'Riordan C.R. Klinger K.W. Shihabuddin L.S. Cheng S.H. CNS-targeted gene therapy improves survival and motor function in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 1253-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) gives a robust rescue of SMN-Δ7 motor behavior and survival, whereas muscle-specific SMN expression does not (Gavrilina et al., 2008Gavrilina T.O.

Genet. 2008; 17: 1063-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In contrast, selective genetic reduction of SMN in the motor neurons of mice is not lethal, though NMJ structural and electrophysiological abnormalities are observed (Park et al., 2010bPark G.H. Maeno-Hikichi Y. Awano T. Landmesser L.T. Monani U.R.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 12005-12019Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and genetic restoration of SMN in motor neurons alone does not rescue mutant lethality (Gogliotti et al., 2012Gogliotti R.G. Quinlan K.A. Barlow C.B. Heier C.R. Heckman C.J. Didonato C.J.

Goldhamer D.J. et al.Survival motor neuron protein in motor neurons determines synaptic integrity in spinal muscular atrophy.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 8703-8715Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition to the motor neuron defects, pronounced early deficits of spinal reflexes and reduced numbers of proprioceptive synaptic inputs onto motor neurons have recently been described in SMN-Δ7 mice, although functional contribution of these changes to the SMA phenotype is not yet known (Ling et al., 2010Ling K.K. Lin M.Y. Zingg B. Feng Z. Ko C.P. Synaptic defects in the spinal and neuromuscular circuitry in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar; Mentis et al., 2011Mentis G.Z.

Early functional impairment of sensory-motor connectivity in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy.Neuron. 2011; 69: 453-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings suggest the possibility that neurons other than motor neurons could contribute to the motor deficits in SMA. Here, we have exploited Drosophila mutants with low levels of SMN to determine the essential cellular site and requirement for SMN in the motor system of this model. Using previously described loss-of-function smn mutants (Chan et al., 2003Chan Y.B. Miguel-Aliaga I. Franks C. Thomas N. Trülzsch B. Sattelle D.B. Davies K.E. van den Heuvel M. Neuromuscular defects in a Drosophila survival motor neuron gene mutant.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1367-1376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Chang et al., 2008Chang H.C. Dimlich D.N. Yokokura T.

Salz H.K. Matera A.G. A Drosophila melanogaster model of spinal muscular atrophy reveals a function for SMN in striated muscle.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we confirmed that depletion of SMN in Drosophila results in reduced muscle growth and defective locomotion similar to SMA phenotypes and showed that this was accompanied by aberrant rhythmic motor output and neuromuscular junction neurotransmission. Surprisingly, we found that none of these defects could be rescued by transgenic restoration of SMN in either the muscles or motor neurons of Drosophila smn mutants. Rather, we discovered that SMN must be restored in both proprioceptive neurons and cholinergic interneurons in order to rescue smn mutant phenotypes. Our results reveal that the disruption of motor neurons and muscles is a secondary consequence of a primary dysfunction of sensory-motor network activity in this SMA model, and we demonstrate that genetic or pharmacological strategies that increase motor circuit excitability can positively benefit smn mutant phenotypes. Furthermore, in a companion manuscript (Lotti et al., 2012Lotti F. Imlach W.L. Saieva L. Beck E.S. Le H.T. Li D.K. Jiao W. Mentis G.Z. Beattie C.E. McCabe B.D. et al.An SMN-dependent U12 splicing event essential for motor circuit function.Cell. 2012; 151 (this issue): 440-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar [this issue of Cell]), we demonstrate that an SMN-dependent gene required for normal motor circuit function in Drosophila is also disrupted in the motor circuits of SMN mutant mice. These results suggest that disruption of motor circuit function may be critical to SMA and that strategies designed to manipulate the activity of motor networks might be employed to ameliorate SMA patient symptoms. To model the low level of SMN found in SMA patients in Drosophila, we utilized the zygotic protein null smn allele, smnX7, which is a small deficiency that removes the entire smn coding region without disrupting nearby loci (Chang et al., 2008Chang H.C. Dimlich D.N. Yokokura T. Mukherjee A. Kankel M.W. Sen A. Sridhar V. Fulga T.A. Hart A.C. Van Vactor D. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Modeling spinal muscular atrophy in Drosophila.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The remaining SMN in these animals is contributed by maternal protein, which provided <6% of the level of SMN compared to controls at the third instar larval stage (Figure S1A available online). smnX7 mutants never initiated pupation but instead persisted as third instar larvae, often surviving several days at this stage, which is consistent with other smn mutant alleles (Chan et al., 2003Chan Y.B. Miguel-Aliaga I. Franks C. Thomas N. Trülzsch B. Sattelle D.B. Davies K.E. van den Heuvel M. Neuromuscular defects in a Drosophila survival motor neuron gene mutant.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1367-1376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that this phenotype was dependent on SMN, we ubiquitously expressed a transgenic upstream activation sequence (UAS) flag-tagged SMN construct (Chang et al., 2008Chang H.C. Dimlich D.N. Yokokura T. Mukherjee A. Kankel M.W. Sen A. Sridhar V. Fulga T.A. Hart A.C. Van Vactor D. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Modeling spinal muscular atrophy in Drosophila.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) in smnX7 mutants using Actin-Gal4. This restored normal pupation of smnX7 mutants, with 100% of larvae initiating pupation and >80% subsequently eclose to produce adults (data not shown). Thus, smnX7 mutants have low levels of SMN at late larval stages and can be rescued by transgenic SMN. We used this mutant allele for all subsequent experiments except where noted. In humans, depletion of SMN affects both muscles and motor function. We noted that Drosophila smn mutant larvae were smaller than control animals and examined whether this was associated with a reduction in muscle size. We labeled smn mutant and control larval muscles with phalloidin and found that smn mutants had a 46% (p < 0.001) reduction in muscle surface area compared to controls (Figures 1A–1C and Table S1). This defect was fully rescued by ubiquitous expression of transgenic SMN. smn mutant larvae were also sluggish and moved less frequently than controls. To quantify this defect, we used video capture and tracing software to measure their locomotion. We found that smn mutants showed a 63% (p < 0.001) decrease in locomotion velocity compared to control animals, which was restored to control levels by ubiquitous expression of transgenic SMN (Figures 1D–1F). Thus, similar to SMA patients, Drosophila larvae with low levels of SMN have muscle and locomotion defects. Locomotion of Drosophila larvae has been linked to the rhythmic activity of segmental central pattern-generating networks (CPGs) in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) (Fox et al., 2006Fox L.E. Soll D.R. Wu C.F. Coordination and modulation of locomotion pattern generators in Drosophila larvae: effects of altered biogenic amine levels by the tyramine beta hydroxlyase mutation.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1486-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), which receive inputs from both the brain hemispheres (Cattaert and Birman, 2001Cattaert D. Birman S. Blockade of the central generator of locomotor rhythm by noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists in Drosophila larvae.J. Neurobiol. 2001; 48: 58-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and proprioceptive sensory neurons (Cheng et al., 2010Cheng L.E. Song W. Looger L.L. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N.

Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Peripheral multidendritic sensory neurons are necessary for rhythmic locomotion behavior in Drosophila larvae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5199-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and output activity to motor neurons. To measure the activity of these pattern-generating neurons, we recorded the spontaneous activity of motor neurons in preparations where we left the brain and VNC in situ (Fox et al., 2006Fox L.E. Soll D.R. Wu C.F. Coordination and modulation of locomotion pattern generators in Drosophila larvae: effects of altered biogenic amine levels by the tyramine beta hydroxlyase mutation.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1486-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In control animals, we observed periodic bursting of motor activity at regular intervals, which was consistent with previous studies (Cattaert and Birman, 2001Cattaert D. Birman S. Blockade of the central generator of locomotor rhythm by noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists in Drosophila larvae.J. Neurobiol. 2001; 48: 58-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar; Fox et al., 2006Fox L.E. Soll D.R. Wu C.F.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1486-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (Figure 1G). In contrast, this activity was disrupted in smn mutants, which had short, irregular bursts that varied in duration (Figure 1H). We quantified this defect by measuring the average interspike interval between all spontaneous spike events in smn mutants and controls over a fixed time period. Compared to controls, smn mutants showed a 90% (p < 0.001) increase of interspike interval (Figure 1I). As with locomotion, normal rhythmic motor activity was fully restored by ubiquitous expression of transgenic SMN. Thus, the output of motor circuits is defective in Drosophila smn mutants. To investigate the neurotransmitter release properties of individual motor neurons, we removed the brain and stimulated motor neurons directly by using a suction electrode (Imlach and McCabe, 2009Imlach W. McCabe B.D. Electrophysiological methods for recording synaptic potentials from the NMJ of Drosophila larvae.J. Vis. Exp. 2009; 24: 1109PubMed Google Scholar). Compared to controls, we found a 23% (p < 0.005) increase of evoked excitatory postsynaptic potential (eEPSP) amplitude at the NMJs of smn mutants (Figures 1J–1L). The increase of NMJ eEPSP amplitude in smnX7 mutants was restored to control levels by ubiquitous expression of transgenic SMN (Figure 1L). We also observed a 60% (p < 0.05) increase in miniature excitatory postsynaptic potential (mEPSP) frequency. In contrast, mEPSP amplitude at smn mutant NMJ terminals was not different than controls (Figures S2A and S2B), leading to a 64% (p < 0.001) increase in quantal content (Figure S2C). These findings are consistent with a presynaptic change in the neurotransmitter release properties of motor neurons in smn mutants. As our electrophysiology results differed from a previous report (Chan et al., 2003Chan Y.B. Miguel-Aliaga I. Franks C. Thomas N. Trülzsch B. Sattelle D.B. Davies K.E. van den Heuvel M. Neuromuscular defects in a Drosophila survival motor neuron gene mutant.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1367-1376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we also examined transheterozygous combinations of smnX7 with other smn mutant alleles and confirmed similar changes in eEPSP amplitudes in these mutants that were not found in heterozygous smnX7 animals (Figure S2D). When we examined the morphological features of smnX7 mutant NMJs, we observed no significant difference in the number of synaptic boutons compared to controls (Figure S2E). In summary, we find that Drosophila smn mutants have increased NMJ-evoked neurotransmitter release that is accompanied by defects in muscle growth, locomotion, and motor rhythm. In order to identify the cell-autonomous requirement for normal SMN levels, we used iteratively more tissue-restricted Gal4 drivers to assess rescue of smn mutants. We began by expressing transgenic SMN only in the muscles of smnX7 mutants using G14-Gal4, a larval muscle-specific driver. This produced no significant increase in muscle surface area (Figures 2C and 2E ) or effects upon the locomotion, rhythmic motor output, and NMJ eEPSP amplitude of smn mutants (Figures 2F–2H). We therefore tested SMN restoration only in the nervous system of smn mutants using the neuron-specific nsyb-Gal4 driver. In contrast to muscle restoration of SMN, panneuronal restoration of SMN fully rescued the muscle surface area of smn mutants to control levels (Figures 2B, 2D, and 2E) and also completely restored their locomotor velocity, rhythmic motor output, and NMJ eEPSP amplitudes (Figures 2F–2H). Neuron-only rescue of smn mutants was not sufficient to produce viable Drosophila adults (data not shown), presumably due to the SMN level in tissues that are not rescued, becoming depleted to the point where cellular viability was compromised. Our results established that the defects of muscle growth in smn mutant larvae are due to a nonautonomous requirement for normal SMN levels in the nervous system rather than in muscle fibers themselves. The Drosophila VNC, like the human spinal cord, is populated by neurons with diverse neurotransmitter expression. All Drosophila motor neurons, in addition to a subset of central interneurons, are glutamatergic (Daniels et al., 2008Daniels R.W. Gelfand M.V. Collins C.A. DiAntonio A. Visualizing glutamatergic cell bodies and synapses in Drosophila larval and adult CNS.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 508: 131-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Because we observed presynaptic defects in neurotransmitter release at the NMJ in smn mutants, we first tested the ability of transgenic SMN expression in motor neurons to rescue smn mutants. We used OK371-Gal4, an enhancer trap inserted in the vesicular glutamate transporter promoter, to express transgenic SMN only in the glutamatergic neurons of smn mutants. This produced no difference in muscle surface area, locomotion velocity, or rhythmic motor output compared to smn mutants alone (Figures 3E–3G ). Surprisingly, we also observed no reduction of the aberrant increase of eEPSP amplitude at the NMJs of these animals (Figures 3B, 3C, and 3H). We confirmed this unexpected result by using a second independent motor-neuron-specific driver, OK6-Gal4 (Figures 3E–3H). Therefore, similar to the requirement for SMN in muscle growth, the aberrant neurotransmitter release at the NMJ of smn mutants is not the result of the cell-autonomous loss of SMN in motor neurons. This result prompted us to investigate whether SMN was required in other neuron types in the Drosophila motor circuit. Inhibitory inputs are important regulators of motor circuit function (Featherstone et al., 2000Featherstone D.E. Rushton E.M. Hilderbrand-Chae M. Phillips A.M. Jackson F.R. Broadie K. Presynaptic glutamic acid decarboxylase is required for induction of the postsynaptic receptor field at a glutamatergic synapse.Neuron. 2000; 27: 71-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), so we next used glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 promoter Gal4 to restore SMN in GABAergic neurons; however, we observed no significant rescue of any smn mutant phenotype (Figures 3E–3H).

https://openalex.org/W2018012741,"Structures of riboswitch receptor domains bound to their effector have shown how messenger RNAs recognize diverse small molecules, but mechanistic details linking the structures to the regulation of gene expression remain elusive. To address this, here we solve crystal structures of two different classes of cobalamin (vitamin B(12))-binding riboswitches that include the structural switch of the downstream regulatory domain. These classes share a common cobalamin-binding core, but use distinct peripheral extensions to recognize different B(12) derivatives. In each case, recognition is accomplished through shape complementarity between the RNA and cobalamin, with relatively few hydrogen bonding interactions that typically govern RNA-small molecule recognition. We show that a composite cobalamin-RNA scaffold stabilizes an unusual long-range intramolecular kissing-loop interaction that controls mRNA expression. This is the first, to our knowledge, riboswitch crystal structure detailing how the receptor and regulatory domains communicate in a ligand-dependent fashion to regulate mRNA expression."

The shell is thought to have been created when a thermal pulse caused increased mass loss. Similar spiral structures have been observed in association with circumstellar envelopes before, and are thought to be characteristic of binary systems. Combining the observational data with hydrodynamic simulations, the authors conclude that R Sculptoris is a binary that underwent a thermal pulse about 1,800 years ago. The pulse probably lasted for about 200 years and mass loss was approximately three times greater than previously thought. The asymptotic-giant-branch star R Sculptoris is surrounded by a detached shell of dust and gas1,2. The shell originates from a thermal pulse during which the star underwent a brief period of increased mass loss3,4. It has hitherto been impossible to constrain observationally the timescales and mass-loss properties during and after a thermal pulse—parameters that determine the lifetime of the asymptotic giant branch and the amount of elements returned by the star. Here we report observations of CO emission from the circumstellar envelope and shell around R Sculptoris with an angular resolution of 1.3″. What was previously thought to be only a thin, spherical shell with a clumpy structure is revealed to also contain a spiral structure. Spiral structures associated with circumstellar envelopes have been previously seen, leading to the conclusion that the systems must be binaries5,6,7,8. Combining the observational data with hydrodynamic simulations, we conclude that R Sculptoris is a binary system that underwent a thermal pulse about 1,800 years ago, lasting approximately 200 years. About 3 × 10−3 solar masses of material were ejected at a velocity of 14.3 km s−1 and at a rate around 30 times higher than the pre-pulse mass-loss rate. This shows that about three times more mass was returned to the interstellar medium during and immediately after the pulse than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W1988886825,"Vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors, FLK1/KDR and FLT1, are key regulators of angiogenesis. Unlike FLK1/KDR, the role of FLT1 has remained elusive. FLT1 is produced as soluble (sFLT1) and full-length isoforms. Here, we show that pericytes from multiple tissues produce sFLT1. To define the biologic role of sFLT1, we chose the glomerular microvasculature as a model system. Deletion of Flt1 from specialized glomerular pericytes, known as podocytes, causes reorganization of their cytoskeleton with massive proteinuria and kidney failure, characteristic features of nephrotic syndrome in humans. The kinase-deficient allele of Flt1 rescues this phenotype, demonstrating dispensability of the full-length isoform. Using cell imaging, proteomics, and lipidomics, we show that sFLT1 binds to the glycosphingolipid GM3 in lipid rafts on the surface of podocytes, promoting adhesion and rapid actin reorganization. sFLT1 also regulates pericyte function in vessels outside of the kidney. Our findings demonstrate an autocrine function for sFLT1 to control pericyte behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2013779624,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate key biological processes and their aberrant expression may lead to cancer. The primary transcript of canonical miRNAs is sequentially cleaved by the RNase III enzymes, Drosha and Dicer, which generate 5' monophosphate ends that are important for subsequent miRNA functions. In particular, the recognition of the 5' monophosphate of pre-miRNAs by Dicer is important for precise and effective biogenesis of miRNAs. Here, we identify a RNA-methyltransferase, BCDIN3D, that O-methylates this 5' monophosphate and negatively regulates miRNA maturation. Specifically, we show that BCDIN3D phospho-dimethylates pre-miR-145 both in vitro and in vivo and that phospho-dimethylated pre-miR-145 displays reduced processing by Dicer in vitro. Consistently, BCDIN3D depletion leads to lower pre-miR-145 and concomitantly increased mature miR-145 levels in breast cancer cells, which suppresses their tumorigenic phenotypes. Together, our results uncover a miRNA methylation pathway potentially involved in cancer that antagonizes the Dicer-dependent processing of miR-145 as well as other miRNAs."

We found that estrogen stimulation of ERα-positive breast cancer cells resulted in decreased miR-140 expression. We performed promoter analyses and examined predicted ERα binding elements in the miR-140 promoter using luciferase constructs of a miR-140 promoter deletion series. Our studies revealed that ERα binds to one specific estrogen response element flanking the miR-140 promoter and consequently suppresses miR-140 transcription. We found that the stem cell self-renewal regulator SOX2 is a novel target of miR-140, and that this miR-140/SOX2 pathway critically regulates breast tumor-initiating cell survival, providing a new link between ERα signaling and breast cancer stem cell maintenance."

Although Trim28 mRNA is found in many studies to be up-regulated in both lung and breast cancer tissues relative to normal adjacent tissue, we found that within a panel of early-stage lung adenocarcinomas high levels of Trim28 protein correlate with better overall survival. This surprising observation suggests that Trim 28 may have anti-proliferative activity within tumors. To test this hypothesis, we used shRNAi to generate Trim28-knockdown breast and lung cancer cell lines and found that Trim28 depletion led to increased cell proliferation. Likewise, overexpression of Trim28 led to decreased cell proliferation. Confocal microscopy indicated co-localization of E2F3 and E2F4 with Trim28 within the cell nucleus, and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that Trim28 can bind both E2F3 and E2F4. Trim28 overexpression inhibited the transcriptional activity of E2F3 and E2F4, whereas Trim28 deficiency enhanced their activity. Co-immunoprecipitations further indicated that Trim28 bridges an interaction between E2Fs 3 and 4 and HDAC1. Promoter-reporter assays demonstrated that the ability of HDAC1 to repress E2F3 and E2F4-driven transcription is dependent on Trim28. Trim28 depletion increased E2F3 and E2F4 DNA binding activity, as measured by chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays while simultaneously reducing HDAC1 binding. Finally, ChIP-ReChIP experiments demonstrated that Trim/E2F complexes exist on several E2F-regulated promoters. Taken together, these results suggest that Trim28 has anti-proliferative activity in lung cancers via repression of members of the E2F family that are critical for cell proliferation."

We took advantage of this property to develop an assay for small-molecule-based neuroprotection using stem-cell-derived motor neurons and astrocytes, together with activated microglia as a stress paradigm. Here, we report on the discovery of hit compounds from a screen of more than 10,000 small molecules. These compounds act through diverse pathways, including the inhibition of nitric oxide production by microglia, activation of the Nrf2 pathway in microglia and astrocytes, and direct protection of neurons from nitric-oxide-induced degeneration. We confirm the activity of these compounds using human neurons. Because microglial cells are activated in many neurological disorders, our hit compounds could be ideal starting points for the development of new drugs to treat various neurodegenerative and neurological diseases."

The structural basis for the multiple and dominant functions of adenovirus oncoproteins has remained elusive. E4-ORF3 forms a nuclear polymer and simultaneously inactivates p53, PML, TRIM24, and MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) tumor suppressors. We identify oligomerization mutants and solve the crystal structure of E4-ORF3. E4-ORF3 forms a dimer with a central β core, and its structure is unrelated to known polymers or oncogenes. E4-ORF3 dimer units coassemble through reciprocal and nonreciprocal exchanges of their C-terminal tails. This results in linear and branched oligomer chains that further assemble in variable arrangements to form a polymer network that partitions the nuclear volume. E4-ORF3 assembly creates avidity-driven interactions with PML and an emergent MRN binding interface. This reveals an elegant structural solution whereby a small protein forms a multivalent matrix that traps disparate tumor suppressors."

Here, we report the generation of two additional families of related lipids comprising 15-ketoeicosatetraenoic acid (KETE) attached to four phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs). The lipids are generated basally by 15-LOX in IL-4-stimulated monocytes, are elevated on calcium mobilization, and are detected at increased levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from cystic fibrosis patients (3.6 ng/ml of lavage). Murine peritoneal macrophages generate 12-KETE-PEs, which are absent in 12/15-LOX-deficient mice. Inhibition of 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase prevents their formation from exogenous 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid-PE in human monocytes. Both human and murine cells also generated analogous hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid-PEs. The electrophilic reactivity of KETE-PEs is shown by their Michael addition to glutathione and cysteine. Lastly, both 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid-PE and 15-KETE-PE activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ reporter activity in macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, we demonstrate novel peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ-activating oxidized phospholipids generated enzymatically by LOX and 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase in primary monocytic cells and in a human Th2-related lung disease. The lipids are a new family of bioactive mediators from the 12/15-LOX pathway that may contribute to its known anti-inflammatory actions in vivo."

Aberrant expression of the type V collagen α1(V) chain can underlie the connective tissue disorder classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and autoimmune responses against the α1(V) chain are linked to lung transplant rejection and atherosclerosis. The α1(V) collagenous COL1 domain is thought to contain greater numbers of post-translational modifications (PTMs) than do similar domains of other fibrillar collagen chains, PTMs consisting of hydroxylated prolines and lysines, the latter of which can be glycosylated. These types of PTMs can contribute to epitopes that underlie immune responses against collagens, and the high level of PTMs may contribute to the unique biological properties of the α1(V) chain. Here we use high resolution mass spectrometry to map such PTMs in bovine placental α1(V) and human recombinant pro-α1(V) procollagen chains. Findings include the locations of those PTMs that vary and those PTMs that are invariant between these α1(V) chains from widely divergent sources. Notably, an unexpectedly large number of hydroxyproline residues were mapped to the X-positions of Gly-X-Y triplets, contrary to expectations based on previous amino acid analyses of hydrolyzed α1(V) chains from various tissues. We attribute this difference to the ability of tandem mass spectrometry coupled to nanoflow chromatographic separations to detect lower-level PTM combinations with superior sensitivity and specificity. The data are consistent with the presence of a relatively large number of 3-hydroxyproline sites with less than 100% occupancy, suggesting a previously unknown mechanism for the differential modification of α1(V) chain and type V collagen properties."

To investigate the mechanism through which pleiotrophin regulates tumor metastasis, we used two different prostate carcinoma cell lines, DU145 and PC3, in which the expression of RPTPβ/ζ or syndecan-3 was down-regulated by the RNAi technology. The loss of RPTPβ/ζ expression initiated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased the ability of the cells to migrate and invade. Importantly, the loss of RPTPβ/ζ expression increased metastasis in nude mice in an experimental metastasis assay. We also demonstrate that RPTPβ/ζ counterbalanced the pleiotrophin-mediated syndecan-3 pathway. While the inhibition of syndecan-3 expression inhibited the pleiotrophin-mediated cell migration and attachment through the Src and Fak pathway, the inhibition of RPTPβ/ζ expression increased pleiotrophin-mediated migration and attachment through an interaction with Src and the subsequent activation of a signal transduction pathway involving Fak, Pten, and Erk1/2.

Oocytes were harvested from albino Xenopus laevis females and manually defolliculated following a 1-h treatment with 640 units/ml type IV collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) in Ca2+-free ND-96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). Following nuclear injection of cDNAs encoding α-, β-, and γENaC (0.02 μg/μl each), cells were incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH) for 20–24 h prior to study. Oocytes were voltage clamped (two-electrode voltage clamp), and currents were amplified with an Oocyte Clamp OC-725C (Warner Instruments), digitized with a MacLab/200 interface (ADInstruments), and recorded and analyzed with Chart software (ADInstruments). As noted, recordings were performed at −60 mV in a 58 mm Na2SO4 solution (58 mm Na2SO4, 58 mm d-mannitol, 2 mm KCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). High Na+ (116 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH) and low Na+ solutions (1 mm NaCl, 115 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2 mm KCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH adjusted with HCl) were used as indicated in the figure legends to measure Na+ self-inhibition. Amiloride-sensitive current was determined by adding 10 μm amiloride to the bathing solution. pH-induced changes in amiloride-sensitive current were calculated as the -fold increase/decrease relative to the base-line current in pH 7.4 Na2SO4 Ringer's just prior to each test solution application. This was done to reduce the effect of time-dependent current run-down. Na+ self-inhibition was measured by rapidly changing the bathing solution from low sodium (1 mm NaCl) to high sodium (116 mm NaCl) and quantitated as ((peak current − steady-state current)/peak current). Cl− inhibition was measured by rapidly changing the bathing solution from high chloride (116 mm NaCl) to low chloride (58 mm Na2SO4) and quantitated as -fold change in amiloride-sensitive current. In all experiments, to account for day-to-day variation, values were normalized to values recorded from cells expressing wild-type ENaC on the same day. All values are reported as averages ± S.E. Statistical significance was calculated using a two-tailed Student's t test (p < 0.05). To identify residues in the ENaC extracellular domains that are required for regulation by acidic pH, we took advantage of the species dependent differences in pH sensitivity (14.Collier D.M. Snyder P.M. Extracellular protons regulate human ENaC by modulating Na+ self-inhibition.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 792-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In Xenopus oocytes, we measured the change in activity of human and rat ENaC in response to changes in extracellular pH. To focus on the stimulatory effect of acidic pH, we carried out our experiments in low Cl− solutions (11.Collier D.M. Snyder P.M. Extracellular chloride regulates the epithelial sodium channel.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 29320-29325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We measured changes in ENaC activity over a pH range from 9.0 to 5.25. Fig. 1A shows representative current traces, and Fig. 1B plots the pH-induced change in current (relative to pH 7.4). Consistent with previous results, alkaline pH decreased human ENaC activity (black trace), and acidic pH increased human ENaC activity. However, rat ENaC current was relatively insensitive to pH over a range of 9.0 to 6.5, and pH 5.5 and 5.25 produced small increases in current (gray trace). The difference in pH sensitivity between human and rat ENaC provided a strategy to identify the residues that contribute to changes in channel activity in response to changes in extracellular pH. ENaC functions as a heterotrimer of α-, β-, and γENaC subunits. To narrow our search for the residues that contribute to human ENaC pH sensitivity, we measured the change in ENaC activity in response to pH in cells expressing combinations of human and rat ENaC subunits. Given the decreased pH sensitivity of rat ENaC, we predicted that co-expression of rat ENaC subunits with human ENaC subunits would decrease pH sensitivity relative to a channel composed of only human ENaC subunits. Fig. 1C shows representative current traces, and Fig. 1, D–F, shows the pH dose-response relationships. Replacing human βENaC with rat βENaC (expressed with human α- and γENaC) had no effect on the pH dose response relative to cells expressing human αβγENaC (Fig. 1D, traces overlay). When human αENaC was replaced with rat αENaC, acidic pH produced a larger increase in current than cells expressing only human ENaC subunits (Fig. 1, C and E). However, when human γENaC was replaced with rat γENaC, ENaC activation by acidic pH was eliminated (Fig. 1, C and F). These data demonstrate that human γENaC is necessary for human ENaC to respond to acidic changes in pH. To test whether human γENaC is sufficient for the pH response, we expressed rat α- and βENaC with human γENaC. The pH dose-response relationship for channels expressing this combination of two rat and one human subunit was very similar to channels expressing only rat αβγENaC (Fig. 2). This demonstrates that although human γENaC was required, it was not sufficient to restore pH sensitivity to rat ENaC. Therefore, the data suggest that more than one subunit is involved in the pH response seen in human ENaC. We hypothesized that sequence differences between the extracellular domains of human and rat γENaC contributed to differences in pH regulation. Fig. 3 shows a partial sequence alignment of the extracellular domain of human and rat γENaC. In total, 50 residues differ between the two species in the extracellular domains of γENaC (indicated by boxes). Of these, we focused on 15 residues that H+ might titrate within the physiologically relevant acidic pH range (acidic residues and histidines, Fig. 3, gray boxes). We mutated each of these residues to Ala and tested the effect of pH changes on ENaC current. Fig. 4A shows representative current traces for wild type ENaC and one of the mutants, γD166A. This mutation reduced ENaC stimulation by acidic pH. In Fig. 4B, we plotted the total change in ENaC current between pH 9.0 and pH 5.25 for each of the 15 mutants (relative to wild type ENaC). We found that seven of the mutations (γD164A, γQ165A, γD166A, γE292A, γD335A, γH439A, and γE455A) decreased activation of ENaC current by acidic pH (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the other mutations had no effect or slightly increased the pH response (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Mutation of titratable residues in the extracellular domain of γENaC decreases the response to acidic pH.

Currents were recorded under conditions of high Na+ (116 mm) and low extracellular Cl− (5 mm) over a range of pH from 9.0 to 5.25 (only pH 5.25 is shown). ENaC-dependent inward Na+ current was determined by application of amiloride at the end of the experiment.

To test this idea further, we generated a human γENaC construct in which the seven residues that reduced the response to acidic pH were mutated simultaneously (γD164A,Q165A,D166A,E292A,D335A,H439A,E455A, labeled γ7Ala). Cells expressing human αβγ7AlaENaC had a greater reduction in their response to acidic pH than any single mutation alone (Fig. 4, C and D), consistent with a role for multiple residues. However, the response to acidic pH was not abolished, indicating that additional ENaC residues also contribute. Interestingly, ENaC inhibition by alkaline pH (pH 7.4–9.0) was identical to wild type ENaC (Fig. 4D). Thus, different residues are responsible for ENaC regulation by acidic and alkaline pH. In previous work, we found that extracellular Cl− inhibits ENaC. To test the specificity of these mutations for pH, we measured the inhibition of ENaC activity by extracellular Cl−. A reduction in extracellular Cl− increased the γ7Ala mutant current to an extent similar to wild type ENaC (Fig. 4, E and F). This demonstrates that the decrease in the response to acidic pH seen with the γ7Ala mutations did not result from a nonspecific change in channel activity. Because the γ7Ala mutations did not abolish ENaC regulation by acidic pH, we searched for additional contributing residues. We turned our attention to α- and βENaC; our finding that human γENaC alone was not sufficient to explain the species difference in pH regulation supported a role for one or more additional subunit(s). Of the seven human γENaC residues that contributed to pH regulation, one was conserved in αENaC (αD357,γD335), and two were conserved in βENaC (βE281,γE292 and βE446,γE455, Fig. 5A). To test their role in pH regulation, we mutated each residue individually to Ala. Two of the mutations (αD357A and βE281A) did not reduce the effect of pH on ENaC current (Fig. 5C). In contrast, βE446A had a large effect, decreasing the acidic pH response by 75% (Fig. 5, B and C). Fig. 5E shows the pH dose-response relationship for βE446A; this mutation selectively reduced ENaC stimulation by acidic pH but had no effect on inhibition by alkaline pH. In αENaC, the corresponding residue carries a positive charge (αK477). In contrast to results with β- and γENaC, mutation of αK477 to Ala increased ENaC stimulation by acidic pH (Fig. 5, D and E). Together, the data suggest that the negative charge of βE446 and equivalent positions in α- and γENaC are important for protons to modulate ENaC activity. To investigate this possibility further, we replaced βE446 with Cys. This mutation reduced ENaC activation by acidic pH to the same degree as the Ala mutation at this position (Fig. 5F). Modification of the Cys with MTSES, to restore the negative charge, partially rescued pH regulation of ENaC (Fig. 5F). Mutating βE446 to Lys elicited a pH dose response nearly identical to βE446A or βE446C (data not shown). These findings indicate that the negative charge at this position is important for ENaC activation by acidic pH. We performed a similar series of experiments at the αK477 position. We mutated αK477 to Cys. This mutation increased the response to acidic pH to a degree similar to the Ala mutation (Fig. 5G). When we introduced a negative charge by modifying the Cys mutant with MTSES, the response to acidic pH increased even further (Fig. 5G). These data indicate that a negative charge at this position in α-, β-, or γENaC allows ENaC to be activated by protons. In Fig. 6, A and B, we co-expressed βE446A with γ7Ala (and wild type α). Acidic pH failed to stimulate this mutant channel, whereas inhibition by alkaline pH was intact. Cells expressing αβE446Aγ7AlaENaC also showed increased amiloride-sensitive current at pH 7.4 (in 116 mm NaCl Ringer's), suggesting that Ala mutations mimic ENaC stimulation by the protonated state of the wild type acidic residues (Fig. 6C). However, ENaC inhibition by extracellular Cl− was not significantly reduced (Fig. 6D), demonstrating that the mutations are specific to activation by extracellular pH. These results identify eight residues in the extracellular domains of β- and γENaC that are required for regulation by acidic pH but are not involved in regulation by alkaline pH or Cl−. In previous work, we found that protons stimulate ENaC in part by reducing Na+ self-inhibition, a process by which extracellular Na+ decreases ENaC activity. Here we asked whether protons modulate Na+ self-inhibition through the eight titratable residues we identified in β- and γENaC. We varied the extracellular pH (7.4 or 5.5) and measured Na+ self-inhibition by shifting the extracellular Na+ concentration from 1 to 116 mm. This produced a large peak inward current (Ip) that decreased to a lower steady-state current (Iss, Fig. 7A); the fraction of current inhibited by Na+ (Na+ self-inhibition) is plotted in Fig. 7C. For wild type ENaC, Na+ inhibited channel activity to a greater extent at pH 7.4 than at pH 5.5 (Fig. 7, A and C), consistent with our previous work (14.Collier D.M. Snyder P.M. Extracellular protons regulate human ENaC by modulating Na+ self-inhibition.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 792-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mutation of the eight residues (βE446A and γ7Ala) dramatically reduced Na+ self-inhibition at pH 7.4 and nearly abolished the effect of acidic pH on Na+ self-inhibition (Fig. 7, B and C). Mutation of the γENaC subunit alone (γ7Ala) had an intermediate effect (Fig. 7C). Intriguingly, Na+ self-inhibition for wild type ENaC and the mutants converged at pH 5.5 (Fig. 7C), suggesting that neutralization of the acidic residues by protonation or mutagenesis have equivalent effects on Na+ self-inhibition. In this work, we identified eight residues that participate in the regulation of ENaC activity by extracellular acidification. Mutation of seven residues in γENaC (Asp-164, Gln-165, Asp-166, Glu-292, Asp-335, His-439, and Glu-455) and one residue in βENaC (Glu-446) each reduced ENaC stimulation by acidic pH, whereas simultaneous mutation of all eight abolished stimulation. Although ENaC is a constitutively active channel, a wide variety of extracellular stimuli can modulate its activity, including H+, Cl−, Na+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, shear stress, and proteases (8.Garty H.

In this regard, it is clear that the extracellular domain functions as a sensor to detect changes in the composition and quantity of the highly varied extracellular milieu in which ENaC resides. The residues we identified could function as proton sensors through titration of their side chains. Alternatively, they could function downstream of proton binding by transducing conformational changes that underlie channel gating. Several lines of evidence support the first model in which these residues are directly titrated by protons. First, all of the residues have side chains that are titrated in the acidic pH range (Glu, Asp, His), with the exception of Gln-165. Although the role of Gln-165 in the acidic pH response may seem contrary to this idea, its location may alter the pKa or accessibility of two surrounding acidic residues (Asp-164 and Asp-166). Second, the charge of the residues was critical. Neutralization of the charge, by mutation to Ala, mimicked the effect of acidic pH by increasing ENaC current. Conversely, restoration of the negative charge (by MTSES modification of βE446C) restored ENaC regulation by acidic pH. Likewise, introduction of a negative charge at the equivalent position in αENaC (via MTSES modification of αK477C) enhanced ENaC activation by acidic pH. Finally, mutation of these eight residues abolished ENaC regulation by acidic pH, but did not alter its regulation by alkaline pH or Cl−. Therefore, the mutations did not cause general changes in ENaC gating. This finding also indicates that different residues mediate ENaC regulation by acidic pH and by alkaline pH. Thus we favor a model in which the eight identified residues are titrated by protons but we cannot exclude other potential mechanisms. Although ENaC subunits share a high degree of sequence similarity, there is growing evidence to suggest that the functional roles of each subunit are strikingly different. Several examples exist. In earlier work, we demonstrated that the three ENaC subunits play differing roles in regulation by extracellular Cl− (12.Collier D.M. Snyder P.M.

Mutation of equivalent histidine residues in α- and γENaC have opposite effects on Na+ self-inhibition (10.Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R.

Moreover, mutations at the DEG position also have varying effects when introduced into each ENaC subunit (24.Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Bucher D.B. A pore segment in DEG/ENaC Na+ channels.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28484-28490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 25.Snyder P.M. Bucher D.B. Olson D.R. Gating induces a conformational change in the outer vestibule of ENaC.J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here we identified conserved negatively charged residues in βENaC (Glu-446) and γENaC (Glu-455) that contribute to regulation by acidic pH. However, there is a charge reversal at the equivalent position in αENaC (Lys-477). Mutation of this basic residue increased the effect of acidic pH on ENaC current, opposite to the effects of mutating the acidic residues in β- and γENaC. This finding indicates that there is functional asymmetry among the three ENaC subunits in regard to regulation by acidic pH. We took advantage of species differences in ENaC regulation to identify residues required for regulation by pH; rat (and mouse) ENaC is much less sensitive to pH than human ENaC. We do not yet know why pH regulation of ENaC varies among species. In humans, differences in diet can produce wide variations in urine pH. For example, consumption of meat produces an acidic urine, whereas vegetarians have an alkaline urine. Perhaps rats and mice lacked selective pressure to develop or retain the pH response because of a less varied diet. ENaC is exposed to extreme changes in pH. Our data suggest that the ENaC extracellular domain functions as a sensor to detect these pH changes and to respond with appropriate changes in ENaC activity, and hence, in Na+ absorption. It is intriguing that acidic pH has dual effects on ENaC activity. In addition to stimulatory effect investigated here, acidic pH also reduces ENaC activity by enhancing Cl− inhibition (11.Collier D.M. Snyder P.M. Extracellular chloride regulates the epithelial sodium channel.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 29320-29325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect occurs through αH418 and γH396, which contribute to Cl− binding sites in the extracellular domain of ENaC. Protonation of these residues is thought to enhance Cl− binding through electrostatic effects. These opposing effects of pH may function to fine-tune renal Na+ absorption. With hypovolemia, delivery of NaCl to the collecting duct is low and the urine is acidic. Under these low Cl− conditions, the stimulatory effect of protons predominates, maximizing Na+ absorption. Conversely, with hypervolemia, the inhibitory effect of protons is enhanced by rising Cl− concentrations. This serves to reduce Na+ absorption. By modulating renal sodium absorption, changes in extracellular pH and ion concentrations may collaborate to maintain volume homeostasis and to regulate blood pressure.

https://openalex.org/W2037431302,"NEG2, a short C-terminal segment (817–838) of the unique regulatory (R) domain of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel, has been reported to regulate CFTR gating in response to cAMP-dependent R domain phosphorylation. The underlying mechanism, however, is unclear. Here, Lys-946 of cytoplasmic loop 3 (CL3) is proposed as counter-ion of Asp-835, Asp-836, or Glu-838 of NEG2 to prevent the channel activation by PKA. Arg-764 or Arg-766 of the Ser-768 phosphorylation site of the R domain is proposed to promote the channel activation possibly by weakening the putative CL3-NEG2 electrostatic attraction. First, not only D835A, D836A, and E838A but also K946A reduced the PKA-dependent CFTR activation. Second, both K946D and D835R/D836R/E838R mutants were activated by ATP and curcumin to a different extent. Third, R764A and R766A mutants enhanced the PKA-dependent activation. However, it is very exciting that D835R/D836R/E838R and K946D/H950D and H950R exhibited normal channel processing and activity whereas D835R/D836R/E838R/K946D/H950D was fractionally misprocessed and silent in response to forskolin. Further, D836R and E838R played a critical role in the asymmetric electrostatic regulation of CFTR processing, and Ser-768 phosphorylation may not be involved. Thus, a complex interfacial interaction among CL3, NEG2, and the Ser-768 phosphorylation site may be responsible for the asymmetric electrostatic regulation of CFTR activation and processing.

Recent functional and biochemical studies have shown that correct interdomain interactions of CFTR are required not only for its optimal activation but also for its optimal folding, biosynthesis, and trafficking from endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (6Serohijos A.W.

Our recent investigations uncovered that Ser-768 inhibits the CFTR activity by interacting with CL3 no matter whether it is phosphorylated or not (9Wang G. State-dependent regulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gating by a high affinity Fe3+ bridge between the regulatory domain and cytoplasmic loop 3.J. Biol.

Chem. 2011; 286: 2171-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the nonphosphorylated state, the -OH group of Ser-768 forms a putative H-bond with the imidazole group of His-950 of CL3 (10Wang G. The inhibition mechanism of non-phosphorylated Ser-768 in the regulatory domain of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2171-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, Ser-768 may enhance binding of Fe3+ to His-950, His-954, Cys-832, Asp-836, and His-775 at the interface of the R domain and CL3 (9Wang G. State-dependent regulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gating by a high affinity Fe3+ bridge between the regulatory domain and cytoplasmic loop 3.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 40438-40447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because Cys-832 and Asp-836 are residues of NEG2 and close to CL3 (19Xie J. Adams L.M. Zhao J. Gerken T.A. Davis P.B. Ma J. A short segment of the R domain of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator contains channel stimulatory and inhibitory activities that are separable by sequence modification.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23019-23027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we wondered whether the interaction of NEG2 with CL3 modulates CFTR activation and whether the Ser-768 phosphorylation site is involved (Fig. 1B). Human wild type (WT) CFTR was subcloned into the pCDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). All of the mutants were produced by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene and confirmed by automated sequencing and Western blotting. A Cys-free construct without all 18 cysteines was provided by Dr. David Gadsby (Rockefeller University). ΔR-S660A-CFTR was provided by Michael Welsh (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T cells were transiently transfected with WT or mutant CFTR cDNA using the Lipofectamine transfection kit (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mm penicillin/streptomycin. For patch clamp recordings, all cells were grown on plastic coverslips and used 1–4 days after seeding. Some channels expressed in HEK-293T cells were recorded in inside-out configurations (Dagan 3900A; Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN) for intracellular application of reagents to the cytoplasmic face. CFTR currents were recorded in symmetrical solutions each containing 140 mm N-methyl-d-glutamine chloride, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm TES (pH 7.3). The resulting resistance of borosilicate patch pipette was 3–4 megohms in the bath solution. Macroscopic currents were evoked using a ramp protocol from +80 to −80 mV with a 10.75-s time period and filtered at 200 Hz. Single-channel recordings at 60 mV were filtered at 20 Hz. 1.5 mm MgATP and 100 units/ml PKA were used to activate the CFTR channel. For those channels expressed in HEK-293T cells and recorded in whole cell configurations, a ramp protocol from +40 to −40 mV was employed with a 10.75-s time period and filtered at 200 Hz. Moreover, 1.5 mm ATP was introduced in the electrode solution, and 50 μm forskolin and 50 μm curcumin were used to estimate the current density of some CFTR mutants. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C). Data were acquired and analyzed using pCLAMP8.1 software (Axon Instruments). Data are shown as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to test statistical significance. Curve fitting was made using Microcal Origin software. Transfected HEK-293T cells expressing CFTR WT and mutants were washed in divalent-free PBS (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) and then solubilized in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis. Each sample was running on a 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes for 60 min at 24 V (Genie Blotter; Research Products International Corp.). The membranes were blocked overnight with LI-COR blocking buffer (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) and then Western-blotted with the C-terminal CFTR antibody mAb 24-1 (R&D Systems) at 1:5000 and detected with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 1:100,000. Blots were extensively washed by a TBS buffer (20 mm Tris base and 135 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and then scanned to obtain fluorescent images with an Odyssey scanner (LI-COR). To address whether a putative electrostatic attraction between CL3 and NEG2 regulates CFTR gating, we first determined the PKA-dependent activity of several mutants at the CL3-NEG2 interface. Fig. 2A indicates that a low concentration (6 units/ml) of PKA activated WT CFTR slowly and weakly. In contrast, mutation of Lys-946 or Asp-836 to alanine clearly accelerated the channel activation and reduced the PKA dependence (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar observations with D835A and E838A are summarized in Fig. 2D. The K1/2 for PKA activation was reduced from 10 to 5 units/ml once Lys-946 from the CL3, and Asp-835, Asp-836, and Glu-838 from NEG2 were mutated to alanines (Fig. 2D). However, K951A failed to change the PKA-dependent channel activity (Fig. 2D). Thus, a putative electrostatic attraction between Lys-946 and Asp-835, Asp-836, or Glu-838 may weaken the PKA sensitivity of CFTR activation. To further confirm the putative electrostatic attraction between CL3 and NEG2, we determined the effects of curcumin on the mutants at the CL3-NEG2 interface. In the presence of 1.5 mm ATP, 50 μm curcumin greatly potentiated the K946A mutant activity, which was further increased by PKA (Fig. 3A). If this effect is due to a disruption of the putative electrostatic interaction between CL3 and NEG2, K946D or D835R/D836R/E838R should exhibit a similar effect in the presence of ATP. To support this argument, ATP and curcumin partially increased the K946D activity, and PKA (6 units/ml) completely activated this mutant (Fig. 3B). In contrast, ATP and curcumin dramatically activated the D835R/D836R/E838R mutant. However, addition of PKA decreased the channel activity (Fig. 3C). This decrease in the channel current may be due to the side effect of curcumin (24Wang W. Bernard K. Li G. Kirk K.L. Curcumin opens cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channels by a novel mechanism that requires neither ATP binding nor dimerization of the nucleotide-binding domains.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4533-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is interesting that ATP and curcumin only activated the K946D mutant by 40% but activated the D835R/D836R/E838R mutant completely (Fig. 3D). Thus, the regulation of CFTR activation by the putative electrostatic attraction between Lys-946 and NEG2 may be limited and asymmetric. The triple arginine mutant of NEG2 may not only disrupt the putative electrostatic interaction with K946 but also weaken the Fe3+ binding at the CL3-R interface because Asp-836 is one of important Fe3+ ligands (9Wang G. State-dependent regulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gating by a high affinity Fe3+ bridge between the regulatory domain and cytoplasmic loop 3.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 40438-40447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, for K946D, His-950 or His-954 may still form the inhibitive Fe3+ bridge with the R domain. To support this argument, K946D/H950D was employed to weaken both the electrostatic attractions and the Fe3+ bridge between CL3 and the R domain. Fig. 3D demonstrates that ATP and curcumin completely activated the K946D/H950D mutant. This high activity may not be due to the H950D mutation because it cannot be activated by ATP and curcumin (10Wang G. The inhibition mechanism of non-phosphorylated Ser-768 in the regulatory domain of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2171-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibitive Fe3+ bridge at the R-CL3 interface should be weakened when the electrostatic interactions at the same interface are investigated. On the other hand, previous studies demonstrated that CFTR can be activated by ATP alone, and PKA does not exert any effect on the channel activation when NEG2 is deleted (19Xie J. Adams L.M. Zhao J. Gerken T.A. Davis P.B. Ma J. A short segment of the R domain of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator contains channel stimulatory and inhibitory activities that are separable by sequence modification.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23019-23027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). If this ATP-induced activation results from the disruption of the putative electrostatic attraction between CL3 and the C terminus of NEG2, a similar effect should be observed. However, neither K946D nor D835R/D836R/E838R was fully activated by ATP alone (Fig. 3, B and C). To investigate further the ATP-dependent activity of the CFTR mutants at the R-CL3 interface, the whole cell CFTR currents were recorded to maximize the ATP effect on the channel activity when 1.5 mm ATP was introduced in the electrode solution. Even if the activity of the inside-out patch expressing a CFTR construct is very low in the presence of ATP, any ATP-induced effect should be observed in the whole cell configuration. Fig. 4A indicates that when the whole cell current was determined with D835R/D836R/E838R, the application of external forskolin to the bath solution increased the mutant current. It is interesting that external curcumin continued to potentiate the mutant activity. Finally, glibenclamide or CFTRinh172 completely suppressed the mutant current (Fig. 4A). A similar case was observed with H950R (Fig. 4B). Because the D835R/D836R/E838R mutant exhibited a lower current with forskolin than H950R or WT CFTR, a cell capacitance was measured with WT and D835R/D836R/E838R CFTR constructs before and after forskolin was applied to evaluate the contribution of trafficking (20Lewarchik C.M.

Table 1 demonstrates that the cell capacitances of both WT and D835R/D836R/E838R were stable upon activation by forskolin. Thus, the low forskolin-stimulated current of the latter may not be due to trafficking.TABLE 1Whole cell currents Im (picoamperes) and capacitances Cm (picofarads) of HEK-293T cells expressing CFTR constructs in response to forskolinConstructsStimulated ImControl CmStimulated CmnWT-CFTR701.6 ± 9.017.4 ± 0.916.4 ± 1.13D835R/D836R/E838R539.5 ± 5.315.0 ± 1.016.2 ± 0.83 Open table in a new tab Although both D835R/D836R/E838R and H950R were greatly activated by forskolin and curcumin, the introduction of K946D and H950D to D835R/D836R/E838R prevented the channel activation by forskolin and curcumin (Fig. 4, C and D). It is very attractive that the small basic conductance was clearly observed before the inhibition by glibenclamide (Fig. 4C). In contrast, D835R/D836R/E838R and H950R failed to exhibit the basic activity (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, Asp-835, Asp-836, and Glu-838 may not be responsible for the channel activation by ATP. Other parts of NEG2 may interact with other domains or other parts in the R domain to remove the PKA-dependent channel activation. Upon normalization of the channel current to the cell capacitance, the insertion of K946D/H950D to D835R/D836R/E838R dramatically reduced the CFTR current density (Fig. 4D). In contrast, D835R/D836R/E838R and K946D/H950D and H950R exhibited comparable current densities (Fig. 4D). Thus, the putative electrostatic attractions between CL3 and the R domain may not be exchangeable to suppress the maximal channel activity. In other words, the NEG2-CL3 electrostatic effects on the maximal channel activity may be asymmetric. The putative electrostatic attraction between K946/H950R and D835/D836/E838 failed to inhibit the maximal channel activity, but the putative electrostatic attraction of D835R/D836R/E838R with K946D/H950D greatly suppressed the maximal channel activity. To further determine whether the reduction in the current density of K946D/H950D/D835R/D836R/E838R originates from the decrease in the channel expression or the single channel conductance, we carried out Western blot analysis. Fig. 5 shows that both WT and ΔR CFTR constructs had a very strong mature band C but a very weak immature band B, suggesting that the deletion of the R domain had no effect on channel processing. Similar cases were seen with D835R/D836R/E838R and H950R and K946D/H950D (Fig. 5). However, the insertion of K946D/H950D to D835R/D836R/E838R clearly reduced the fractional mature Band C by 50%. Thus, the asymmetric electrostatic regulation of the maximal channel activity at the NEG2-CL3 interface may be due to the asymmetric electrostatic regulation of channel processing. However, the maximal channel activity of D835R/D836R/E838R/K946D/H950D was still very low (Fig. 4D). Therefore, it is also possible that the putative electrostatic CL3-R attraction may also stop the channel opening (10Wang G. The inhibition mechanism of non-phosphorylated Ser-768 in the regulatory domain of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2171-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although previous studies demonstrated that Ser-768 phosphorylation had no electrostatic contribution to the channel gating, nonphosphorylated Ser-768 may form a strong putative H-bond with H950D to affect the CL3-NEG2 electrostatic interaction (10Wang G. The inhibition mechanism of non-phosphorylated Ser-768 in the regulatory domain of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2171-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, we prepared a control mutant S768D/K946D/H950D to exclude this putative H-bond. Fig. 4D indicates a high current density of S768D/K946D/H950D based on a whole cell patch recording. The introduction of D835R to this mutant failed to change the current density. However, the insertion of D836R or E838R to S768D/K946D/H950D dramatically reduced the CFTR current density (Fig. 4D). Fig. 5 further demonstrates that the fractions of the mature Band C of S768D/K946D/H950D/D836R and S768D/K946D/H950D/E838R were also significantly decreased by 45%. Thus, the reduction of their current densities may result from the decrease in the channel processing and opening (10Wang G. The inhibition mechanism of non-phosphorylated Ser-768 in the regulatory domain of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2171-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Taken together, the asymmetric electrostatic regulation of CFTR activation and processing was not due to the putative H-bond. However, because S768D mimics Ser-768 phosphorylation and H950R/S768D also exhibited high channel activity (10Wang G. The inhibition mechanism of non-phosphorylated Ser-768 in the regulatory domain of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2171-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), Ser-768 phosphorylation failed to change the asymmetric electrostatic regulation of CFTR activation and processing. Because both Ser-768 and Asp-836 are close to His-950 of CL3, it is fitting to ask whether Arg-764, Arg-765, and Arg-766 form a salt bridge with the C terminus of NEG2 to cause the asymmetry of the electrostatic regulation. Because R764X and R766M were reported with CF patients, we investigated whether missense alanine mutation of Arg-764 and Arg-766 alters the channel processing and activity. Fig. 4D demonstrates that both R764A and R766A exhibited a normal channel density. Fig. 5 further shows that they were also processed normally. However, Fig. 6 demonstrates that the PKA-dependent activity of these two mutants was greatly enhanced. The K1/2 for PKA activation of R764A and R766A increased from 10 units/ml to 25 and 44 units/ml, respectively. Thus, a putative electrostatic attraction between Arg-764 or Arg-766 and Asp-835, Asp-836, or Glu-838 may weaken the putative electrostatic attraction between Lys-946 and Asp-835, Asp-836, or Glu-838. To support this hypothesis, we determined whether S832C is closed enough to S768C to form a detectable disulfide bond cross-linking based on the Cys-free CFTR construct. Fig. 7 demonstrates that 10 μm diamide greatly suppressed the channel activity of S768C/S832C/V510A but failed to affect the channel activities of both S768C/V510A and S832C/V510A. Thus, the Ser-768 phosphorylation site may be close to the C terminus of NEG2. Taken together, these observations clearly suggest that a putative salt bridge between Arg-766 or Arg-764 and Asp-836 or Glu-838 may weaken the putative inhibitory electrostatic attraction between Lys-946 and Asp-835 or Asp-836 or Glu-838.FIGURE 7Effects of diamide on CFTR mutants at the R-CL3 interface.

Based on the findings that both Ser-768 and Asp-836 are close to CL3 (9Wang G. State-dependent regulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gating by a high affinity Fe3+ bridge between the regulatory domain and cytoplasmic loop 3.J. Biol.

Chem. 2011; 286: 2171-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the current study further uncovered the regulation role of the complex electrostatic interaction between the R domain and CL3 in channel activation and processing. Our results strongly suggest that the putative electrostatic attractions of CL3 with the C terminus of NEG2 in the whole CFTR prohibited the channel activation by PKA. More importantly, Arg-764 and Arg-766 of the Ser-768 phosphorylation site may regulate the CL3-NEG2 interaction by a putative salt bridge with NEG2. Finally, the putative electrostatic attractions of CL3 with both NEG2 and the Ser-768 phosphorylation site may lead to CFTR misprocessing. Unlike CFTR, other ATP-binding cassette transporters do not have a regulatory domain but express and function well on the cell membrane. However, the deletion of the R domain does not affect CFTR expression (10Wang G.

Stimulation of CFTR activity by its phosphorylated R domain.Nature. 1997; 389: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, the location of the R domain was found not to be essential for the function (28Ostedgaard L.S. Baldursson O. Welsh M.J. Regulation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl− channel by its R domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7689-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Finally, the R domain is unstructured and disordered (29Ostedgaard L.S. Baldursson O. Vermeer D.W. Welsh M.J. Robertson A.D. A functional R domain from cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is predominantly unstructured in solution.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

CFTR regulatory region interacts with NBD1 predominantly via multiple transient helices.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, the R domain seems unnecessary for the CFTR activation until Ma's group found that a reduction in the negative charge of NEG2 of the R domain promotes the channel activation (19Xie J. Adams L.M. Zhao J. Gerken T.A. Davis P.B. Ma J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 23019-23027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our study further suggests that the putative electrostatic interactions between NEG2 and CL3 regulate the CFTR activation. First, the PKA sensitivity of channel activation was significantly enhanced for K946A, D835A, D836A, and E838A mutants (Fig. 2). Second, the curcumin sensitivity was also increased for K946A, K946D, and D835R/D836R/E838R (Fig. 3). Finally, it is very exciting that the putative electrostatic attraction between K946D/H950D and D835R/D836R/E838R dramatically suppressed the maximal channel activity by stopping the channel processing or opening (10Wang G. The inhibition mechanism of non-phosphorylated Ser-768 in the regulatory domain of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2171-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, the putative electrostatic attraction between K946/H950R and D835/D836/E838 failed to exert this inhibitory effect (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). Moreover, the putative Fe3+ bridge, H-bond, or Ser-768 phosphorylation at the R-CL3 interface failed to affect this asymmetric electrostatic regulation. Therefore, the third charged motif may be involved. Because both Ser-768 and Asp-836 are close to His-950 (9Wang G. State-dependent regulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gating by a high affinity Fe3+ bridge between the regulatory domain and cytoplasmic loop 3.J. Biol.

Chem. 2011; 286: 2171-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and Ser-768 may be closed to Cys-832 (Fig. 7), we examined whether Arg-764 or Arg-766 interacts with NEG2 and thus destroys the symmetry of the putative electrostatic attraction between CL3 and NEG2. Our finding shows that R764A and R766A suppressed not the channel processing and the current density but the channel activation by PKA (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). Thus, we propose two models of the electrostatic regulation. First, Asp-835, Asp-836, or Glu-838 may interact electrostatically with both Lys-946 and Arg-764 or Arg-766 (Fig. 8A). The former may prohibit the channel activation by PKA whereas the latter may promote the channel activation by PKA possibly by weakening the former interaction. However, the putative electrostatic attraction between CL3 and NEG2 may not be exchangeable. Otherwise, a putative electrostatic attraction of CL3 (K946D/H950D) with both NEG2 (D836R or E838R) and the Ser-768 phosphorylation site (Arg-764 or Arg-766) may result in misprocessing and low channel activity (Fig. 8B). Therefore, a complex electrostatic balance among CL3, NEG2, and the Ser-768 phosphorylation site may ensure the normal channel processing and activity. However, S945L and H949Y, found in patients with CF, are close to Lys-946 and His-950 of CL3 and stop maturation of the protein (31Seibert F.S. Linsdell P. Loo T.W. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27493-27499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). What is more, CL3 also involves ubiquitination-dependent CFTR trafficking (32Drévillon L. Tanguy G. Hinzpeter A. Arous N. de Becdelièvre A. Aissat A. Tarze A. Goossens M. Fanen P. COMMD1-mediated ubiquitination regulates CFTR trafficking.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e18334Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Finally, D979A in CF patients causes misprocessing (33Clain J. Fritsch J. Lehmann-Che J. Bali M. Arous N. Goossens M. Edelman A. Fanen P.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9045-9049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction of Lys-946 with the COMMD1 protein (32Drévillon L. Tanguy G. Hinzpeter A. Arous N. de Becdelièvre A. Aissat A. Tarze A. Goossens M. Fanen P.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9045-9049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) may also result in the asymmetric electrostatic regulation by orchestrating the integral folding to enhance or stabilize CFTR expression on the membrane, allowing more proteins to exit from endoplasmic reticulum, or accelerating the fuse of stabilized CFTR-containing vesicles with the cell membrane. The important finding with NEG2 is that the deletion of NEG2 activates the CFTR channel in the presence of ATP but PKA does not continue to increase the channel activity (19Xie J. Adams L.M. Zhao J. Gerken T.A. Davis P.B. Ma J. A short segment of the R domain of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator contains channel stimulatory and inhibitory activities that are separable by sequence modification.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23019-23027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the current study indicates that mutation of Asp-835, Asp-836, and Arg-838 to alanine or arginine failed to greatly promote the channel activation by ATP although the PKA dependence was reduced. Thus, other parts of NEG2 may interact with other stimulatory RRXS motifs in the R domain. Phosphorylation of these sites or removal of those parts of NEG2 may weaken their electrostatic attractions and thus activate the channel. We thank Drs. Joseph Hume, Nathanael Heyman, and Lih Chyuan Ng for technical support and assistance and Drs. David Gadsby and Xuehong Liu for helpful discussion."

Platelets harvested from the dematin headpiece knock-out (HPKO) mouse model exhibit a striking defect in the mobilization of calcium in response to multiple agonists of platelet activation. The reduced calcium mobilization in HPKO platelets is associated with concomitant inhibition of platelet aggregation and granule secretion.

The mutant platelets show nearly normal spreading on fibrinogen and an unaltered basal cAMP level; however, the clot retraction was compromised in the mutant mice. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that dematin is present both at the dense tubular system and plasma membrane fractions of platelets.

Dematin is also a substrate of multiple protein kinases, and phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase reversibly abolishes its actin bundling function in vitro (3.Husain-Chishti A. Levin A.

The primary structure of dematin includes a carboxyl-terminal domain with sequence similarity to the headpiece domain found in the villin-type family of cytoskeletal proteins (2.Khanna R. Chang S.H.

The amino-terminal core domain of dematin shows sequence similarity to the LIM domain-containing proteins termed ABLIMs (5.Roof D.J. Hayes A. Adamian M. Chishti A.H. Li T.

These two isoforms of dematin are generated by alternative splicing of a single gene located on human chromosome 8p21 (9.Azim A.C. Knoll J.H. Beggs A.H. Chishti A.H.

The 48-kDa isoform of dematin, composed of 383 amino acids, predicts a protein with an isoelectric point of 9.54, whereas the 52-kDa isoform consisting of 405 amino acids is generated by the 22-amino acid insertion within the headpiece domain (2.Khanna R.

It is to be noted that although the 383 amino acids of dematin predict a protein of 43 kDa, the two isoforms of dematin isolated from erythrocytes migrate as 48 and 52 kDa bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (3.Husain-Chishti A.

This anomalous electrophoretic migration is probably due to the presence of a cluster of negatively charged residues within the core domain shared between the two isoforms of dematin (2.Khanna R.

The spectrin-actin junctions, also called the junctional complex, are critical for maintaining the mechanical properties of the erythrocyte membrane. These junctions are assembled by a multiprotein complex consisting of spectrin, actin, dematin, adducin, protein 4.1R, tropomyosin, tropomodulin, calmodulin, and p55/MPP1. This multiprotein complex is linked to the plasma membrane by several transmembrane proteins, including glycophorin C, band 3, and GLUT1 (glucose transporter-1), in a species-specific manner (1.Khan A.A.

The HPKO mice are characterized with defects in erythrocyte shape, membrane stability, and membrane cytoskeletal interactions (2.Khanna R. Chang S.H. Andrabi S. Azam M. Kim A. Rivera A. Brugnara C.

Despite our improved understanding of dematin function in mature erythrocytes, its function in non-erythroid cells has just begun to be appreciated. Dematin is a widely expressed protein with immunoreactive polypeptides present in heart, brain, skeletal muscle, lung, and kidney (2.Khanna R. Chang S.H. Andrabi S. Azam M. Kim A. Rivera A. Brugnara C. Low P.S. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Headpiece domain of dematin is required for the stability of the erythrocyte membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Using the HPKO mouse model, we recently demonstrated that dematin headpiece domain deletion results in impaired wound healing in vivo, delayed cell migration, and enhanced fibroblast adhesion (14.Mohseni M. Chishti A.H. The headpiece domain of dematin regulates cell shape, motility, and wound healing by modulating RhoA activation.Mol. Cell.

Interestingly, both adducin and RhoA have been functionally implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and signaling pathways in platelets (17.Barkalow K.L. Italiano Jr., J.E. Chou D.E.

In this paper, we provide evidence that dematin is abundantly expressed in platelets and functions as a novel regulator of calcium homeostasis. The HPKO mice display multiple defects in platelet functions, thus unveiling dematin as an important regulator of the cytoskeleton and signaling pathways in platelets. Blood was collected from healthy human donors and adult mice. Generally, 5–6 wild type (WT) and HPKO mice were anesthetized by inhalation of 3% isoflurane, and blood was collected from the inferior vena cava. Blood was anticoagulated with 17 volume (∼15%) of ACD (85 mm trisodium citrate, 83 mm dextrose, and 21 mm citric acid) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was harvested by centrifugation of the blood at 180 × g for 15 min at room temperature. The PRP was centrifuged for 10 min at 600 × g in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml prostaglandin E1 and 5 mm EDTA. Washed platelets were resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer (10 mm HEPES, 12 mm NaHCO3, 137 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 5.0 mm glucose, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 0.35% BSA). Platelets were allowed to rest for 60 min, and 1.0 mm CaCl2 was added prior to the start of each experiment. Western blotting of dematin in human (3 × 108 platelets/ml) and mouse (2 × 108/ml) platelets was performed using multiple antibodies directed against the core domain of dematin (3.Husain-Chishti A. Levin A. Branton D. Abolition of actin-bundling by phosphorylation of human erythrocyte protein 4.9.Nature. 1988; 334: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The dematin antibodies used in this study recognized both human and mouse dematin in a comparable fashion, as indicated in our previous studies (1.Khan A.A. Hanada T. Mohseni M. Jeong J.J. Zeng L. Gaetani M. Li D. Reed B.C. Speicher D.W. Chishti A.H.

Chem. 2007; 282: 4124-4135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of mouse dematin was performed according to the protocol previously developed in our laboratory for mouse fibroblasts (14.Mohseni M. Chishti A.H. The headpiece domain of dematin regulates cell shape, motility, and wound healing by modulating RhoA activation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4712-4718Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, washed WT and HPKO platelets were treated with the proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin (10 μm) and MG-132 (5 μm), for 30 min at 4 °C. Platelet fractions were then isolated by sonication and centrifugation. The membrane fraction was probed with a dematin polyclonal antibody and a polyclonal β-tubulin antibody from Sigma. Human platelet fractions were isolated using a previously published protocol (19.Kovàcs T. Berger G. Corvazier E. Pàszty K. Brown A. Bobe R. Papp B. Wuytack F. Cramer E.M. Enouf J. Immunolocalization of the multi-sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase system in human platelets.Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 97: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Platelet fractions were probed with a dematin monoclonal antibody, a PDI monoclonal antibody to detect the dense tubular system (DTS), and a monoclonal antibody against GPIbα to detect the plasma membrane fraction. A monoclonal antibody (sc-100385) against human IP3KB was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and a monoclonal antibody against RhoA was used as a loading control. Glass coverslips were coated with 100 μg/ml human fibrinogen in 0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 8.3) at 4 °C overnight, and wells were blocked with 5% BSA. Washed human platelets (5 × 107 platelets/ml) were added to each well and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. After washing, platelets were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, treated with the permeabilization buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 154 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm leupeptin, 1.0 mm PMSF, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and blocked with 5% BSA. Dematin monoclonal, PDI monoclonal, and dematin polyclonal antibodies were used with the appropriate secondary antibodies. Finally, the coverslips were mounted to slides, and immunofluorescence images were recorded using a 100× objective on a Nikon TE-2000E inverted microscope. cAMP measurements were performed using a protocol as described previously (20.Gilman A.G. A protein binding assay for adenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1970; 67: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 21.Srinivasan S. Mir F. Huang J.S. Khasawneh F.T. Lam S.C. Le Breton G.C. The P2Y12 antagonists, 2-methylthioadenosine 5′-monophosphate triethylammonium salt and cangrelor (ARC69931MX), can inhibit human platelet aggregation through a Gi-independent increase in cAMP levels.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16108-16117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro 20–1724 (100 μm) was added to WT and HPKO platelets. The platelets were centrifuged, and the pellet fraction was snap frozen in the liquid nitrogen. The platelet pellet was resuspended in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, sonicated, boiled for 4 min, and then snap frozen to precipitate the proteins. Upon thawing, the samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube to quantify cAMP. A standard curve of cAMP was generated to quantify cAMP levels in the samples. Samples were incubated with [3H]cAMP, PKA inhibitor, and PKA. Potassium phosphate (20 mm) was then added, and samples were filtered to collect the cAMP-PKA complex. Filters were then dissolved with Cellosolve, and radioactivity was measured using a Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter. This assay was similar to the immunofluorescence assay with minor modifications. Glass coverslips were coated with 100 μg/ml human fibrinogen in 0.1 m NaHCO3 at 4 °C overnight and then blocked with 5% BSA for 90 min. Washed mouse platelets (5 × 107 platelets/ml) were preincubated with DMSO or 10 μm indomethacin and 2.0 units/ml apyrase for 30 min. Platelets were added to each well and allowed to incubate for up to 90 min at 37 °C. The wells were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Platelets were treated with the permeabilization buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 154 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm Leupeptin, 1.0 mm PMSF, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and blocked with 5% BSA. Phalloidin-Alexa 594 at 2.0 μg/ml was added to visualize F-actin. The coverslips were mounted to glass slides and immunofluorescence images were recorded using a ×100 objective on a Nikon TE-2000E microscope. Platelet surface area was calculated using MetaMorph software, and statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. Platelet secretion was measured using the luciferin/luciferase reagent (Chrono-Lume) to detect the release of ATP from platelet dense granules. Platelet aggregation was measured by changes in the light transmission. Mouse washed platelets (2 × 108 platelets/ml) were incubated for 3 min with the Chrono-Lume prior to stimulation. Platelets were treated with a specific agonist at a range of concentrations to establish a dose-response curve. The following agonists were used: 0.6–2.0 μg/ml collagen, 0.25–1.0 μm U46619, 5–10 μm ADP, and 40–100 μm TRAP4 (thrombin receptor-activating peptide 4). All experiments were recorded in real time in a model 700 Chrono-log Lumiaggregometer at 37 °C with stirring (1,000 rpm). Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. Platelet fractions were isolated similar to a previously established procedure (19.Kovàcs T. Berger G. Corvazier E. Pàszty K. Brown A. Bobe R. Papp B. Wuytack F. Cramer E.M. Enouf J. Immunolocalization of the multi-sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase system in human platelets.Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 97: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, washed human and mouse platelets (2 × 109 platelets/ml) were incubated in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 154 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, with protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 25 min to remove intact platelets, granules, and mitochondria. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended and represents the mixed membrane fraction, and the high speed supernatant represents the cytosolic fraction. The two fractions were adjusted to equivalent protein concentrations for Western blotting using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). For additional studies, the fraction containing mixed membranes was layered over a 40% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 120 min. The resulting higher density band represents the DTS, and the band at the sucrose interface represents the plasma membrane fraction. The DTS is the primary storage site for intraplatelet releasable calcium. Material in each fraction was washed and recentrifuged before the Western blotting analysis. Washed WT and HPKO platelets (1 × 108 platelets/ml) were stimulated with an agonist and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C without stirring. Platelets were incubated with reagents conjugated to a fluorophore (P-selectin or JON/A) for 15 min at room temperature under cover. Finally, PBS was added to each sample to terminate the reaction, and samples were immediately analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) to measure FSC (platelet size), P-selectin expression (α-granule secretion), and JON/A expression (integrin αIIbβ3 activation). Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. Blood from six WT and six HPKO mice was anticoagulated with 110 volume of 3.8% sodium citrate. PRP was isolated by centrifugation of the whole blood at 100 × g for 15 min. The platelet count in PRP was adjusted with platelet-poor plasma, and packed erythrocytes were added to enhance the contrast of the clot. After resting for 60 min, 2 mm CaCl2 was added, and the PRP was stimulated with 0.4 unit/ml thrombin and gently mixed. Platelets were allowed to incubate at 37 °C for up to 12 h. Two-dimensional size of the retracted clots was quantified using the NIH ImageJ software, and clot retraction was expressed as the percentage retraction (1 − (final clot size/initial clot size)). Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. Bleeding time was measured by cutting off the tip (5 mm) of the tail from each WT and HPKO adult (8–12 weeks) mouse. The tail was immediately immersed in PBS at 37 °C. Bleeding time was recorded until the stable cessation of bleeding was observed. Bleeding experiments were terminated after 420 s if the tail bleeding did not stop. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. Washed platelets (7.5 × 108 platelets/ml) from WT and HPKO mice were resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer. 15 μm FURA-PE3/AM conjugate (Calbiochem) was added to each sample, and samples were allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The samples were centrifuged, and the platelets were resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer (containing 0.1% BSA) and diluted to 1 × 108 platelets/ml. At this point, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 200 μm EGTA, or 10 μm doxorubicin were added, depending on the experiment. The platelets were loaded onto a 96-well assay plate and incubated for 1 h. The agonists (collagen, U46619, TRAP4, A23187, and Thapsigargin) were added robotically, and the samples were analyzed using a FlexStation II (Molecular Devices). Platelet samples were excited at 340/380 nm, and calcium fluorescence was measured at the emission wavelength of 510 nm. The relative Ca2+ fluorescence value was computed by dividing the fluorescence at 340 nm by the fluorescence at 380 nm for each time point. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. Washed platelets were resuspended in lysis buffer, and lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min to promote complete lysis. The cell lysate was centrifuged for 25 min at 15,000 × g to remove any intact and aggregated platelets. Immunoprecipitation was performed on the lysates using a cross-link-immunoprecipitation (IP) kit from Pierce. Briefly, the lysate supernatant was precleared with control beads for 1 h to remove any nonspecific interactions. The precleared lysate was incubated with Protein A/G beads cross-linked to dematin monoclonal antibody for 2 h at room temperature. A monoclonal antibody against GAKIN was used as a negative"
