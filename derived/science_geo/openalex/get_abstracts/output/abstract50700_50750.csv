https://openalex.org/W1969556684,"The correlation among a variety of physiological properties and the histochemical characteristics of muscle fibers belonging to single motor units in a mixed mammalian muscle is directly demonstrated. The population of motor units making up the cat gastrocnemius was classified into three nonoverlapping groups on the basis of a combination of physiological parameters. The muscle fibers belonging to motor units of each physiological type exhibited a distinctive histochemical profile, such that the three basic histochemical ""fiber types"" exactly matched the three physiologically defined groups. Within each individual motor unit, the muscle fibers were histochemically uniform."
https://openalex.org/W1561709121,"Abstract The glycoproteins of three different cell surface membranes of the rat have been investigated by acrylamide gel electrophoresis with the use of discontinuous buffers in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Liver, kidney brush border, and erythrocyte ghost membranes are solubilized in SDS and after brief exposure to dilute base are reduced with βmercaptoethanol. The gels, after washing free of SDS, are Schiff-stained, and it is demonstrated, by the use of glycoproteins of known molecular weight and subunit composition, that the stained patterns represent size separations of glycoprotein subunits. Each membrane is found to have an identifiable glycoprotein subunit pattern composed of at least 6 to 11 different sized subunits. Most of the staining intensity is present in one to three subunits. Although each membrane has its own unique pattern, liver and kidney brush border have four identically sized subunits. These subunits have molecular weights of 250,000, 195,000, 130,000, and 96,000 when estimated by interpolations of relative mobilities between protein markers. The erythrocyte ghost also contains a 96,000 molecular weight glycoprotein subunit. Sialic acid determinations made on cut gel slices show that all prominent Schiff-positive glycoproteins contain sialic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1582529202,"Rabbit antisera were prepared against seven different lysozymes purified from the egg whites of chicken, bobwhite quail, turkey, Japanese quail, ring-necked pheasant, and duck. Cross-reactivity tests by means of quantitative micro-complement fixation were conducted among all possible pairs of these lysozymes as well as with three other lysozymes. The amino acid sequences are known for five of the 10 proteins we examined. A correlation was observed between degree of immunological cross-reactivity and degree of amino acid sequence similarity, with the limitation that proteins differing from each other by 40% or more in sequence exhibited no cross-reactivity in micro-complement fixation tests. This relationship between sequence resemblance and immunological resemblance is compatible not only with the fact that amino acid replacements have generally occurred on the outer surface of the lysozyme molecule during bird evolution but also with current ideas about the size and number of antigenic determinants on proteins and with the idea that the conformation of the polypeptide backbone is strongly conserved during evolution. Cross-reactivity measurements are affected by several parameters that were investigated, including the length of the immunization program, variability among rabbits, and the degree to which the results of reciprocal tests agree. Antiserum specificity broadened with time and reached a plateau after several months of immunization. Considerable variability among rabbits necessitated pooling several sera in inverse proportion to their degree of reaction with the homologous antigen in order to obtain a more representative measurement. The results of reciprocal tests advise measuring cross-reactivity in both directions to better evaluate the degree of antigenic difference between two lysozymes."

https://openalex.org/W1570847980,"Abstract In the inbred C57BL/6N mouse, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase induction by polycyclic hydrocarbons increases rapidly in the neonatal period; this response to these pharmacological, exogenous compounds does not appear in the DBA/2N, NZW/BLN, or NZB/BLN strains. The development of the constitutive hydroxylase activity in the neonatal period is the same in all four strains. Small differences in pH optima, substrate affinities, relative thermolability, or benzo[a]pyrene metabolism, which might have affected the enzyme assay, do not account for the large genetic difference in the response to polycyclic hydrocarbons. The hydroxylase induction by aromatic hydrocarbons is inherited as a simple autosomal dominant trait, designated the ah locus. In the individual mouse that is genetically responsive to polycyclic hydrocarbons, the hydroxylase activity is induced as an all-or-none phenomenon in all tissues which regularly contain the polycyclic hydrocarbon-inducible enzyme. The magnitude of induction of the hydroxylase is 4- to 5-fold in liver, and ranges from 5- to more than 80-fold in kidney, bowel, lung, and skin. The formation of a spectrally distinct carbon monoxide-binding cytochrome from liver microsomes is associated with the polycyclic hydrocarbon-inducible enzyme activity and is not seen in the liver of mice which are genetically nonresponsive to aromatic hydrocarbons. Phenobarbital induces the hepatic oxygenase to similar levels (i.e. about 2-fold) in all four strains."

https://openalex.org/W1505027132,"Abstract Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity is inducible in rat fetal hepatocytes in culture by phenobarbital, the insecticide, 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (p,p'-DDT), benz[a]anthracene, or 3-methylcholanthrene. Between the 2nd and 4th day of age of the primary cultures, the maximal net rate at which the hydroxylase activity accumulates is about the same when phenobarbital, benz[a]anthracene, or 3-methylcholanthrene is in the growth medium at optimal concentrations. The optimal inducing concentrations for each compound are 2.0 mm phenobarbital, 100 µm p,p'-DDT, 13 µm benz[a]anthracene, and 0.75 µm 3-methylcholanthrene. The kinetic data of the oxygenase induction and degradation are the same in liver cell cultures exposed to either phenobarbital or benz[a]anthracene; the time required for doubling the hydroxylase activity is about 3.0 hours, and the initial half-life of the induced enzyme system is about 10½ hours. An additive effect is obtained when either phenobarbital or p,p'-DDT is present with a polycyclic hydrocarbon in the medium, but not when the hepatocytes are treated with phenobarbital plus p,p'-DDT, or with the combination of benz[a]anthracene plus 3-methylcholanthrene. In fetal liver cells exposed to phenobarbital for 3 days, total hepatocellular RNA synthesis does not change significantly or may increase slightly, whereas in hepatocytes treated with benz[a]anthracene for 1 to 3 days, gross RNA synthesis decreases about 30%. There is a 15 to 20% decline in total protein synthesis in liver cell cultures treated with either phenobarbital or benz[a]anthracene for 1 to 3 days. The apparent Michaelis constants for the control hydroxylase and the enzyme system inducible by either phenobarbital or benz[a]anthracene are similar, ranging between 2 and 4 µm in the presence of the substrate, benzo[a]pyrene."

The gels were quantitatively analyzed by spectrophotometric scanning of the protein bands stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. The weight average and number average molecular weights of the proteins of each ribosomal subunit were calculated. The average molecular weights obtained for the two kinds of bacteria were similar and were significantly smaller than those for the two kinds of eucaryotic proteins. The number of moles of protein per 80 S ribosome was estimated to be between 60 and 80, as compared with 40 to 60 proteins per 70 S ribosome. The increased protein content of eucaryotic ribosomes, as compared with bacterial, is explained both by the presence of a greater number of moles of protein and by proteins of larger average size."

https://openalex.org/W1479759720,"The Rh antigens have never been totally and reproducibly obtained in free solution. Indirect evidence, based among other observations on the reversible loss of Rh antigen activity of lyophilized Rh-positive erythrocyte membranes with mercurial sulfhydryl reagents, suggests that the activity may depend on membrane protein. With the hypothesis that this membrane protein may be associated perhaps structurally with membrane lipid, studies were undertaken on the effects of organic solvents on lyophilized membrane Rh antigen activity. The antigen activity was abolished after extensive extraction with 100% 1-butanol, but could be regenerated to approximately 50% of the unextracted membranes by the addition of certain lipids. The present investigations establish that phospholipids are the only class of lipids which result in such regeneration. The binding of 14C-labeled lecithin of biological origin was measured in benzene solution, in sonicated aqueous dispersions, and in 5% methanol-ether dispersions. Regeneration of Rh activity was also followed, which showed that the binding of aqueous sonicated phospholipids (liposomes) was associated with the best regeneration and the maximum labeled lecithin bound. The binding of 14C-fatty acids also occurred under similar conditions, but no associated regeneration of Rh antigen activity was observed. Similarly, an extensive series of nonphosphorus-containing lipids failed to regenerate the antigen activity. Synthetic dipalmitoyl lecithin was found to bind to the 1-butanol-extracted membranes, but not to result in regenerated activity. Labeled phosphorylcholine showed little binding to these membranes, and large amounts of unlabeled phosphorylcholine only mildly depressed the binding of labeled lecithin. This suggests that the binding of the lecithin is predominantly hydrophobic. A graded effect of different phospholipids was noted in regard to the extent of antigen regeneration. Thus, the Rh antigen activity is dependent on the presence of bound phospholipid, containing at least one unsaturated fatty acid, with neither the polar nor the nonpolar portion of the molecule alone satisfying this requirement."
https://openalex.org/W2029963962,"Rabbit antibody was prepared against a high-molecular-weight DNA polymerase purified from the soluble fraction of calf thymus gland. This antibody does not inhibit terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase isolated from that source, but does inhibit both low-molecular-weight and high-molecular-weight DNA polymerases isolated from cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of a number of mammalian tissues (mouse L cells, calf thymus, phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes, rat liver, and rabbit bone marrow). The results suggest that (i) no antigenic relationship exists between terminal transferase and DNA polymerase, (ii) common antigenic determinants exist in the DNA polymerases from all mammalian sources, and (iii) multiple forms of DNA polymerase found in mammalian, cells are related by having polypeptide sequences or subunits in common."
https://openalex.org/W1562956043,Staining for peptidase activities on starch gel after the electrophoresis of lysates of rabbit red blood cells or reticulocytes and the identification of the reaction products revealed the existence of the following three enzymes: (a) An enzyme that hydrolyzes NH2-terminal methionine from methionyl peptides longer than tetrapeptides and from shorter methionyl peptides with blocked carboxy ends. This enzyme does not hydrolyze several peptides tested without methionine at the NH2 termini. (b) An enzyme that cleaves formylmethionine from formylmethionyl peptides. This enzyme can also react with acetylmethionyl peptides but does not hydrolyze several peptides tested without an acylmethionine at the NH2 termini. (c) An enzyme that deformylates formylmethionine. This enzyme can hydrolyze various formyl- and acetylamino acids and may be identical with the nonspecific dipeptidase in red cells. These three enzymes exist also in other tissues and are not bound to ribosomes. NH2-terminal methionine and formylmethionine in the short nascent peptides obtained from reticulocytes were hydrolyzed by hemolysates. These findings suggest that biological function of the methionine aminopeptidase and the formylmethionine-releasing enzyme is to remove the terminal methionine and formylmethionine from nascent peptides.
https://openalex.org/W1503373722,"Abstract Compared with the induction process by benz[a]anthracene, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase induction in fetal rat hepatocyte cultures by phenobarbital is more sensitive to low doses of either actinomycin D or cycloheximide. When actinomycin D at 0.4 nm levels is added simultaneously with phenobarbital in the growth medium, the rate at which induced oxygenase activity accumulates is decreased by more than 30% of normal; this level of actinomycin D does not appreciably alter the enzyme induction by benz[a]anthracene. Stimulation of the oxidase activity by phenobarbital is blocked more than 90% when 35 nm cycloheximide is added with the inducer, whereas the induction process by benz[a]anthracene is unaffected with this level of inhibitor. By extrapolation to other studies in vivo and in cell culture, nucleolar synthesis of ribosomal RNA may be of more importance in the process of microsomal enzyme induction by phenobarbital than that by benz[a]anthracene. Degradation of the phenobarbital- or benz[a]anthracene-induced hydroxylase activity is the same whether the enzyme system is maximally or half-maximally induced; the half-life is 10.5 ± 3.6 hours in fresh control medium and 8.5 ± 2.5 hours in the presence of high levels of cycloheximide. Actinomycin D stabilizes or slightly stimulates the enzyme activity in fetal liver cells previously treated with either phenobarbital or benz[a]anthracene. The continued presence of either inducer in hepatocytes exposed to high levels of cycloheximide or actinomycin D also stabilizes the phenobarbital- or benz[a]anthracene-induced hydroxylase activity. Actinomycin D does not prevent the induction of oxidase activity in cells previously treated with cycloheximide and either inducer. Thus, the induction of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity by either phenobarbital or benz[a]anthracene requires RNA and protein synthesis initially and protein synthesis continuously, and subsequently is insensitive to actinomycin D for several hours. We therefore feel that the primary action of phenobarbital, like that of benz[a]anthracene, is at the level of transcription and that with either inducer there is also a secondary effect of lesser importance at the post-translational level in which the normal rate of decay of the induced enzyme is delayed."

https://openalex.org/W1556815736,"Abstract The interaction of human hemoglobin (Hb) with 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonate (HPT) was studied at pH 6.0 and T/2 = 0.04. Binding of HPT was determined by quenching of its fluorescence upon interaction with Hb. HPT binds to deoxy-Hb with a stoichiometry of 1 mole per mole of Hb tetramer and with a higher affinity for the deoxy than the liganded form analogous to the binding of the physiologically important 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG). Binding is prevented by either DPG or inositol hexaphosphate. A qualitative comparison of the time courses of HPT release and CO combination during the reaction of CO with deoxy-Hb indicates a marked lag in the release of HPT compared with CO binding. This led to the conclusion that during the course of CO binding, significant amounts of partially liganded Hb intermediates are formed and the release of HPT from the intermediates does not occur in proportion to the amount of CO bound. Quantitative analysis of the data, in the form of least squares fitting procedures, was carried out to examine the ability of some elementary models to describe the results. The best fit was obtained on the assumption that HPT is released after 3 CO molecules have bound to hemoglobin."

https://openalex.org/W1538131932,"Abstract The M-components of two macroglobulinemia sera were found to consist of two (serum Naae) and four (serum To) species of IgMK immunoglobulins on the basis of differences in charge, solubility properties, antipolysaccharide specificity or avidity, individual antigenic specificity, amino acid composition of light chains, and NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of light or heavy chains. Striking structural similarities were apparent between individual species of each set of M-components, such as sharing of antipolysaccharide specificity (M-components Naae), and individual antigenic specificity. Furthermore, the light and heavy chains of each set belonged to the same V-region subgroups, and all the To kappa chain species (VkIII) had Val in Position 2. One of the Nae heavy chains (VhIII) had Asp in Position 6, indicating that it represented an unusual VhIII variant. One of the M-components reacted with a human cartilage proteoglycan, probably a chondroitin sulphate-protein complex. The data suggest that antigenic selection may be involved in the development of this limited heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W1507376377,"Abstract Liquid isoelectric focusing profiles of a number of conventionally raised rabbit antibodies directed against acidic, neutral, and basic haptens have been determined. All antibody preparations showed a degree of heterogeneity similar to that already reported for antibodies to the basic hapten p-azophenyltrimethylammonium. There was little difference in the degree of heterogeneity found in the focusing profiles of antibody from different rabbits directed against the same hapten. There appear to be between 10 and 30 individual antibody species in each case, but some of this complexity may be a result of variable, postsynthetic deamidation. Isoelectric focusing profiles of the antigens also showed considerable heterogeneity. The mean isoelectric point of both rabbit and bovine γ-globulins was approximately pH 6.0, and the distribution of the isoelectric point, pI, values of the focused specifically purified rabbit antibodies about this point was reciprocally related to the pI of the focused antigens. It appears that a single charge unit causes a displacement of the mean pI value by approximately 0.1 pH unit. The displacement found for various antibody preparations indicates antibodies to acidic and basic antigens may differ by as many as 19 charged residues."

From the partition studies it was found that predictions of free energy changes for a transfer process (aqueous solution) → (heptane solution) involving a branched chain fatty acid cannot be made by extrapolation of results of studies on unsubstituted straight chain acids. The difference in values for palmitic and phytanic acid is only -2.0 kcal, corresponding to an effective chain elongation of slightly more than 2 CH2 groups (calculated from ΔΔG0 = -0.84 kcal per elongation by 1 CH2) compared with a true increase of 4 carbon atoms. The enthalpy change, ΔH0, was close to 0 for both palmitic and phytanic acids. Comparison of the binding free energies, ΔA0, of two homologues allows the hydrophobic contribution to be isolated as a ΔΔA0. Instead of the normal value ΔΔA0 = ΔΔG0 = -0.51 kcal per CH2 group found for the binding of C2 to C16 fatty acids to serum albumin, the two fatty acids differed by again slightly over two theoretical CH2 groups. Since the ΔE0 values for both the ligands were approximately the same, ΔΔE0 = ΔΔH0 for the four differing CH2 groups were also close to 0 in the albumin binding experiments. The larger hydrophobic bond increment, ΔΔG0 per CH2 group, in transfer to an organic solution as compared with transfer to a protein surface could be explained as a statistical entropy effect. The implications of alkyl chain branching for different types of hydrophobic interactions and the possible relationship to Refsum's disease are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1506854653,"Abstract A specific fungal α-(1 → 4)-glucanase, mycodextranase, useful for the large scale production of nigerose, has been purified to homogeneity in high yield from the culture filtrate of Penicillium melinii QM 1931. It has been resolved into fast and slow forms; designations based on their differing electrophoretic mobilities at pH 4.5. The fast form constitutes about 85% of the protein and enzymatic activity. Both forms hydrolyze the glucan nigeran (mycodextran) and certain oligosaccharides of nigeran yielding nigerose and the tetrasaccharide, O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 3)-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 4)-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 3)-d-glucose, as sole end products. Glucose is not produced. Sedimentation equilibrium studies indicate that fast and slow enzymes both have molecular weights of 40,000 ± 2,000 daltons. They have similar but not identical amino acid compositions both being rich in serine, threonine, glutamic and aspartic acids, but have a low content of cysteine and tryptophan. Both mycodextranases contain associated carbohydrate. The ultraviolet absorption spectra, urea sensitivities, and pH activity profiles for both forms are practically identical. In addition both forms display maximum catalytic activities at 70° and are fully active in 40% dimethyl sulfoxide. Of a number of general enzyme inhibitors tested, only Ag+, Hg+, N-chlorosuccinimide, and N-bromosuccinimide inactivated the fast enzyme. Some aspects of the action pattern and mechanism of the fast form have been examined in detail. It operates via an endo-multichain mechanism; both end products are formed at a constant rate during hydrolysis but nigerose does not arise from tetrasaccharide. Competitive inhibition studies show that the fast enzyme preferentially binds oligosaccharides with alternating α-(1 → 3)- and α-(1 → 4)-glucosidic linkages, and experiments with certain oligosaccharides of nigeran give results consistent with a model in which the substrate-binding site holds 8 glucopyranose units with a catalytic site located midway in this site. The enzyme has been used to study the fine structure of nigeran and the general structure of isolichenin. In the former case this has been done by identifying and quantitating the linkages present at its reducing and nonreducing termini. The data obtained are used to postulate a general mechanism for the biosynthesis of nigeran."

No decrease occurred in animals subjected to any one single treatment. Histological examination indicated hemolysis, hypoplasia of hemopoietic organs, slight hemorrhage, but no evidence of stress. The severity of the anemia was inversely related to the amount of sleep permitted during sleep deprivation. This new syndrome demonstrates marked effects of sleep deprivation on both maturation and destruction of red blood cells. Depletion of serotonin by injection of parachlorophenylalanine blocked the increase in amount of brain waves of the type commonly seen in slow wave sleep but did not eliminate the production of these waves.
