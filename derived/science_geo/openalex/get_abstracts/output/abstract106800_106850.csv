https://openalex.org/W1505685265,"Mitochondrial and cytosolic aconitases have been indicated as major targets of .NO- and O2-.-mediated toxicity in cells due to the oxidant-mediated disruption of the [4Fe-4S] prosthetic group. However, under circumstances in which both .NO and O2-. are generated, their almost diffusion-controlled combination reaction (k = 6.7 x 10(9) M-1 s-1), leading to the formation of peroxynitrite anion (ONOO-), can out-compete the direct reactions of .NO and O2-. with aconitase and even the enzymatic dismutation of O2-. by superoxide dismutase. In this work, we report that ONOO- reacts with isolated pig heart mitochondrial aconitase at 1.4 x 10(5) M-1 s-1, resulting in a significant loss of enzymatic activity. Aconitase activity was totally recovered after postincubation with thiols and ferrous iron, indicating that ONOO- reactions with the enzyme involve the perturbation of the labile Fe alpha to yield the inactive [3Fe-4S] cluster, which is also evident by spectral changes. On the other hand, anaerobic exposure of isolated aconitase to high concentrations of .NO (> 100 microM) led to a moderate inhibition of the enzyme, which could be fully overcome by .NO displacement under an argon-saturated atmosphere, in agreement with the formation of a reversible inhibitory complex between .NO and the active site of aconitase. Superoxide inactivated mitochondrial aconitase at (3.5 +/- 2) x 10(6) M-1 s-1, a reaction rate 3 orders of magnitude slower than its reaction rate with .NO. O2-. could represent the main mechanism of inactivation of the enzyme in systems in which it is formed without significant concomitant production of .NO. Our results imply that the mechanisms by which .NO and O2-. inactivate aconitase in cell systems may not be simple due to their direct reactions with the iron-sulfur cluster, but may rely on the formation of ONOO-."
https://openalex.org/W1509127316,"The Escherichia coli and recombinant human cytosolic aconitases are inactivated by O2-., with a rate constant of approximately 3 x 10(7) M-1 s-1; the corresponding value for the porcine mitochondrial aconitase is approximately 0.8 x 10(7) M-1 s-1. Nitric oxide, which is reported to inactivate aconitase, did not do so at a perceptible rate, while incubation with peroxynitrite led to a rapid loss of aconitase activity. We propose that the reported inactivation of aconitase by nitric oxide in vivo is actually mediated through peroxynitrite, the product of the reaction between O2-. and NO.."
https://openalex.org/W1479871091,"In RBL-2H3 rat tumor mast cells, antigens that cross-link the high affinity cell surface IgE receptor, Fc epsilon R1, activate at least two receptor-associated protein-tyrosine kinases, Lyn and Syk, and cause the tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor beta and gamma subunits, PLC gamma 1, Vav, and other proteins. Cross-linking antigens also induce increased phosphatidylinositol turnover, Ca2+ mobilization, secretion, actin polymerization, spreading, and membrane ruffling. We have used the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, piceatannol (3,4,3',5'-tetrahydroxy-trans-stilbene), to explore the coupling of specific kinases to cellular responses. Piceatannol preferentially inhibits the activity of Syk as compared with Lyn when added to in vitro assays with isolated enzymes. Treatment of RBL-2H3 cells with piceatannol strongly inhibits the antigen-stimulated activation of Syk measured in anti-Syk and anti-phosphotyrosine immune complex kinase assays at concentrations that have no effect on receptor subunit phosphorylation and maintain or increase the activity of Lyn in anti-phosphotyrosine immune complex kinase assays. In cells metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, piceatannol inhibits the antigen-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and most other proteins. However, receptor subunit phosphorylation is unchanged. Selective inhibition of Syk in this manner blocks receptor-mediated down-stream cellular responses (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production, secretion, ruffling, and spreading) while having only minor effects when these responses are induced with drugs that bypass the receptor complex. These results reveal receptor-mediated Lyn activation as a relatively piceatannol-insensitive event that may contribute to receptor subunit phosphorylation and Syk activation but does not per se elicit cellular responses. Receptor-mediated Syk activation on the other hand is highly sensitive to piceatannol, is essential to Fc epsilon R1-mediated cellular responses, and, based on the increased phosphorylation of Lyn in piceatannol-treated cells, may be involved in terminating Lyn activity."
https://openalex.org/W1542980948,"We have developed a rapid and sensitive two capillary-column chromatography and mass spectrometry-based method for the determination of protein phosphorylation sites following recovery of individual phosphopeptides from two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps. With a standard phosphopeptide, we demonstrate detection sensitivity of at least 250 fmol for this system. We applied this technique to the analysis of in vitro sites of tyrosine phosphorylation induced on the T cell-specific protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 in the absence and presence of p56lck. We show that ZAP-70 has a primary autophosphorylation site at Tyr-292, with a secondary site at Tyr-126. We also show additional phosphorylation at Tyr-69, Tyr-178, Tyr-492, and Tyr-493 upon the addition of the protein tyrosine kinase, p56lck. By comparative two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping, we show that ZAP-70 isolated from Jurkat T cells also autophosphorylates at Tyr-292 and Tyr-126. Similar analysis of 32P-labeled Jurkat cells stimulated with anti-T cell receptor antibodies reveals Tyr-492 and Tyr-493 as the principal sites of T cell antigen receptor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, with additional phosphorylation at the Tyr-292, but not the Tyr-126 autophosphorylation site. The high degree of sensitivity achieved with this technology should greatly facilitate the direct biochemical determination of inducible protein phosphorylation events, an experimental strategy that until now has been both time consuming and difficult."
https://openalex.org/W1589817245,"The prophenoloxidase activating system, an enzyme cascade present in arthropod blood, has been shown to be involved in defense and recognition reactions. This system is converted to its active form by fungal 1,3-beta-D-glucans through binding to a plasma protein, a 1,3-beta-D-glucan-binding protein. Here the molecular cloning and carbohydrate composition of the 1,3-beta-D-glucan-binding protein from the freshwater crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus are reported. It is also demonstrated that this protein can act as an opsonin, stimulating phagocytic uptake of yeast particles by isolated blood cells. The deduced amino acid sequence of 1,339 residues shows no significant similarity to proteins with similar functions in other animals such as the mannan-binding and lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins present in mammals. However, a short sequence motif with similarity to the active site of microbial 1,3-1,4-beta-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolases was found to occur twice in the 1,3-beta-D-glucan-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1550161690,"We investigated the effects of a novel marine toxin, mycalolide B, on actin polymerization and actin-activated myosin Mg(2+)-ATPase activity using purified actin and myosin from rabbit skeletal muscle. The results were compared with cytochalasin D which inhibits actin polymerization by binding to the barbed end of F-actin. By monitoring fluorescent intensity of pyrenyl-actin, mycalolide B did not accelerate actin polymerization but quickly depolymerized F-actin, whereas cytochalasin D accelerated actin nucleation and depolymerized F-actin at slower rate. The kinetics of depolymerization suggest that mycalolide B severs F-actin. The relationship between the concentration of total actin and F-actin at different concentration of mycalolide B suggests that mycalolide B forms 1:1 complex with G-actin. Viscometry and electron microscopic observation further suggest that actin filament was depolymerized by mycalolide B. Unlike cytochalasin D, furthermore, mycalolide B suppressed actin-activated myosin Mg(2+)-ATPase activity. We concluded that mycalolide B severs F-actin and sequesters G-actin and may serve as a novel pharmacological tool for analyzing actin-mediated cell functions."
https://openalex.org/W1512898428,"We have mutated the aspartate residue in the putative second transmembrane spanning domain of the alpha 2A-adrenergic receptor (alpha 2AAR) to the non-negatively charged asparagine (D79N) and glutamine (D79Q) and the negatively charged glutamate (D79E) residue in an effort to better characterize the role of this residue, highly conserved among G-protein-coupled receptors, in Na+ regulation of ligand binding and in receptor G-protein coupling. Allosteric modulation of receptor-ligand interactions by Na+ is retained by the D79E alpha 2AAR but lost upon mutation to the uncharged D79N and D79Q residues. Loss of allosteric effects of Na+ is paralleled by a complete loss of retrograde information transfer from G-proteins to alpha 2AAR in AtT20 cells, measured via the sensitivity of radiolabeled agonist binding to Gpp(NH)p. In contrast to the complete elimination of retrograde signaling via the D79N and D79Q alpha 2AAR, anterograde information transfer from receptor to G-protein is modified in a more subtle quantitative way, since agonist-stimulated GTPase activity via D79N and D79Q alpha 2AAR, although apparently attenuated compared to wild type and D79E alpha 2AAR, is no less than the GTPase activity elicited by endogenous somatostatin receptors in AtT20 cells. These data indicate that a negative charge at amino acid residue 79 forecasts sensitivity to allosteric regulation by monovalent cations and its mutation to non-negatively charged residues elicits a nonparallel modulation of receptor-->G-protein versus G-protein-->receptor communication between alpha 2AAR and pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1490103358,"Previous studies have established that reaction of the rat heme-heme oxygenase complex with H2O2 proceeds normally to give verdoheme, whereas reaction of the complex with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid yields a ferryl (FeIV = O) species and a protein radical but no verdoheme. The heme-heme oxygenase complex is shown here to react regiospecifically with ethyl hydroperoxide to give alpha-meso-ethoxyheme. Formation of this product exactly parallels the formation of alpha-meso-hydroxyheme in the normal reaction supported by cytochrome P450 reductase/NADPH or H2O2. These results rule out a nucleophilic mechanism for the alpha-meso-hydroxylation catalyzed by heme oxygenase and indicate that it involves electrophilic (or possibly radical) addition of the distal oxygen of iron-bound peroxide (FeIII-OOH) to the porphyrin ring."
https://openalex.org/W1480812936,"Revealing the regulatory mechanisms involved in P-glycoprotein expression is important to our understanding of multidrug resistance (MDR) in tumor cells. The MDR1 gene encoding P-glycoprotein contained a promoter sequence (-157 to -125) that was found to be homologous with other mdr gene promoters and that specifically interacted with a nuclear protein. The nuclear protein was identified, using a HeLa lambda gt11 cDNA expression library, to be the transcriptional regulator nuclear factor for interleukin-6 (NF-IL6), a member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors that bound an NF-IL-6-like consensus element 5'-TTTCGCAGT-3'. Furthermore, a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (10.1-glutathione S-transferase) containing the partial NF-IL6 cDNA was also found to specifically interact with the MDR1 promoter sequence. Co-transfection of an NF-IL6 expression vector with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene driven by 1018 base pairs of MDR1 5'-flanking sequences demonstrated that NF-IL6 trans-activated the MDR1 promoter. This trans-activation was significantly reduced when the NF-IL6 element in the reporter gene construct was deleted or mutated. Identification of NF-IL6 as an important transcriptional regulator and the implications of its potential role in MDR1 gene induction in response to a variety of stimuli are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1519805802,"Membrane sodium-hydrogen exchangers (NHEs), found in virtually all cell types, appear to have diverse and essential roles in regulating cellular pH and mediating vectorial transport by epithelial cells. However, the functional and physiological role of the recently cloned isoform NHE-4 remains unknown. Unlike other Na-H exchanger isoforms, NHE-4 transfected into NHE-deficient mutant fibroblasts demonstrated no amiloride-inhibitable sodium uptake, under basal or acid-loaded isoosmotic conditions. By immunoblot analysis, only the NHE-4 transfectants synthesized a 100-kDa protein, which cross-reacted to polyclonal antibody made to an NHE-4 fusion protein. However, when cells were subjected to acute hyperosmolar cell shrinkage conditions, amiloride-sensitive NHE activity was readily detected at 420 mosm, exhibiting maximal activity at 490 mosm. By in situ hybridization, NHE-4 expression in the rat kidney was found to be limited to the inner renal medullary collecting tubules, the region of highest tissue osmolarity fluctuations in the body. We conclude that NHE-4 is an unusual isoform of sodium-hydrogen exchangers that may play a specialized supplementary role in cell volume regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1615629447,"To identify genes mediating programmed cell death triggered by interleukin 3 (IL-3)-deprivation of myeloid cells, the IL-3-dependent murine myeloid cell line FDCP-1 was used to screen a mammalian cell expression library for cDNAs that would promote survival following withdrawal of IL-3. A unique 892-base pair cDNA was cloned that prevented the programmed cell death response following IL-3 deprivation by causing antisense suppression of an endogenous 2.4-kilobase (kb) mRNA. A 2.3-kb cDNA containing the identical 892-base pair over-lapping sequence was cloned that encoded a deduced 371-amino acid protein containing a single Kruppel-type zinc finger and a cluster of 4 cysteine/histidine-rich repeats resembling atypical zinc fingers. The 2.4-kb mRNA was found to be ubiquitously expressed in murine tissues and its abundance in FDCP-1 cells was not altered in response to IL-3 deprivation. Since expression of this 2.4-kb mRNA was a prerequisite for the apoptosis response following IL-3 deprivation, the gene encoding it was named requiem. Requiem is likely to encode a transcription factor required for the apoptosis response following survival factor withdrawal from myeloid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1482412291,"Topoisomerase II protein is essential for cell proliferation and is known to exist as a phosphoprotein in cells from both lower and higher eukaryotic species. In this paper, we have investigated the phosphorylation of the alpha isozyme of human topoisomerase II. The topoisomerase II alpha protein was phosphorylated predominantly on serine residues in the human tumor cell lines HeLa and NSCLC-3. Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping studies revealed several sites of phosphorylation in vivo, including a major site that was common to topoisomerase II alpha protein from both HeLa and NSCLC-3 cells. To identify sites of phosphorylation, the regulatory C-terminal domain of human topoisomerase II alpha protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a hexahistidine-tagged fusion protein and purified by nickel chelate chromatography. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping revealed that casein kinase II phosphorylated the C-terminal domain primarily on 2 serine residues in vitro, which were shown to be sites of modification in vivo. Site-directed mutagenesis studies identified these casein kinase II-specific phosphorylation sites as serine 1524 and serine 1376."
https://openalex.org/W1592902260,"Abstract ClpA, the regulatory subunit of Clp protease from Escherichia coli, has two ATP-binding sites in non-homologous regions of the protein, referred to as domain I and domain II. We have mutated the invariant lysine in the ATP-binding sites of domain I and domain II and studied the enzymatic properties of the purified mutant ClpA proteins. The domain I mutant, ClpA-K220Q, was unable to form a hexamer in the presence of nucleotide, but the comparable domain II mutant, ClpA-K501Q, associated into a hexamer in the presence of ATP, indicating that nucleotide binding to domain I favors a conformation required to stabilize the quaternary structure of ClpA. ClpA-K220Q was defective in ATPase activity and in the ability to activate protein and peptide degradation by ClpP, but the defects could be partially overcome by formation of hybrid hexamers with wild-type ClpA. Another domain I mutant, ClpA-K220R, readily formed hexamers in the presence of ATP and retained > or = 60% of the wild-type ATPase activity and ability to activate ClpP. These results indicate that hexamer formation is a prerequisite for expression of enzymatic activity. Domain II mutants ClpA-K501Q and ClpA-K501R had very low ATPase activity (< 10% of wild-type) and a severe defect in activation of protein degradation, which requires ATP hydrolysis. Domain II mutants were able to activate ClpP to degrade a peptide whose degradation required nucleotide binding but not hydrolysis. Nucleotide binding to domain II of ClpA is important to form a productive complex with ClpP, and domain II appears to be primarily responsible for an energy-requiring step in the catalytic cycle unique to the degradation of large proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1526818214,"Purified preparations of rat heart pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase have two polypeptides with molecular weights of 48,000 (p48) and 45,000 (p45). Recently, we reported the primary structure of p48 (Popov, K. M., Kedishvili, N. Y., Zhao, Y., Shimomura, Y., Crabb, D. W., and Harris, R. A. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 26602-26606) and presented evidence that (i) it exhibits kinase activity for pyruvate dehydrogenase and (ii) it belongs to a family of mitochondrial protein kinases unique from other eukaryotic protein kinases. Here, we report the molecular cloning and deduced amino acid sequence of p45. The protein sequence of p45 has 70% identity to the protein sequence of p48. Minor differences exist throughout the protein sequences with the greatest difference occurring at the amino termini. Recombinant p45 protein, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity, catalyzed the phosphorylation and inactivation of kinase-depleted pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, indicating that p45 and p48 correspond to different isoforms of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Northern blot analysis revealed a single hybridizing species of 2.5 kilobases. The highest level of p45 message expression was found in heart and skeletal muscle and the lowest in spleen and lung. Liver, kidney, brain, and testis express intermediate amounts of p45 mRNA. In contrast, p48 mRNA is predominantly expressed in heart, with other tissues expressing only a modest amount of this message. Tissue-specific expression of isoforms of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase may indicate the existence of tissue-specific mechanisms for the regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1495074957,"Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) contains two zinc-dependent catalytic domains (N and C domains) each bearing the motif HEXXH where the two histidines form two of the three amino acid zinc ligands. Sequence alignment of each ACE domain with other zinc metalloproteases, indicates a glutamate residues which putatively constitutes the third zinc ligand and an aspartate residue which may form an indirect zinc interaction. We investigated the functional roles of the glutamate and aspartate residues in the ACE C domain (Glu987 and Asp991) using a cDNA encoding an inactive N domain. We mutated Glu987 to aspartate (E987D) or valine (E987V) and Asp991 to glutamate (D991E) or alanine (D991A). Catalytically active mutants (E987D, D991E and D991A) exhibited similar Km values for hippuryl-His-Leu compared to non-mutated C domain. E987D displayed a 300-fold decrease in kcat and a 25-fold reduction in sensitivity to the ACE inhibitor trandolaprilat, whose binding is zinc-dependent. E987V was catalytically inactive and did not bind [3H]trandolaprilat. D991E and D991A exhibited a 3.8- and 22-fold decrease in kcat, respectively, and the Ki' values for trandolaprilat were increased 8- and 29-fold. These results provide strong evidence that Glu987 constitutes the third zinc ligand in the ACE C domain and suggest a role for Asp991 in positioning the C domain active site zinc ion."
https://openalex.org/W1566908409,"Expression of the cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) genes is regulated developmentally and by numerous epigenetic factors. Here we report the identification of a cis-regulatory element and cognate nuclear binding protein(s) responsible for cAMP-induced expression of the rat cardiac alpha-MHC gene. By Northern blot analysis, we found that, in primary cultures of fetal rat heart myocytes, the elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP results in up-regulation of alpha-MHC and down-regulation of beta-MHC mRNA expression. This effect of cAMP was dependent upon the basal level of expression of both MHC transcripts and was sensitive to cycloheximide. In transient expression analysis employing a series of alpha-MHC/CAT constructs, we identified a 31-base pair fragment located in the immediate upstream region (-71 to -40), which confers both muscle-specific and cAMP-inducible expression of the gene. Within this 31-base pair fragment there are two regions, an AT-rich portion and a hybrid motif which contains overlapping sequences of E-box and M-CAT binding sites (GGCACGTGGAATG). By substitution mutation analysis, both elements were found important for the basal muscle-specific expression; however, the cAMP-inducible expression of the gene is conferred only by the E-box/M-CAT hybrid motif (EM element). Using mobility gel shift competition assay, immunoblotting, and UV-cross-linking analyses, we found that a protein binding to the EM element is indistinguishable from the transcription enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) in terms of sequence recognition, molecular mass, and immunoreactivity. Methylation interference and point mutation analyses indicate that, besides M-CAT sequences, center CG dinucleotides of the E-box motif CACGTG are essential for protein binding to the EM element and for its functional activity. Furthermore, our data also show that, in addition to TEF-1, another HF-1a-related factor may be recognized by the alpha-MHC gene EM element. These results are first to demonstrate transcriptional activation of a sarcomeric gene by cAMP and support the role of TEF-1 and HF-1a-like factors in the regulation of alpha-MHC gene expression in cardiac myocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1520595787,"Previous studies have shown that a single type of transmembrane receptor is able to regulate multiple effectors through the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. For example, the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells inhibits adenylyl cyclase, stimulates phospholipase C-dependent intracellular Ca2+ release, and activates phospholipase A2 through pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. However, it is unclear whether multiple effector enzymes can be regulated by one type of heterotrimeric G protein within a single cell. To investigate this question, we constructed a derivative of G alpha i3 (termed G alpha i3 C > S) in which the carboxyl-terminal cysteine residue, the site for pertussis toxin modification, was changed to a serine. Following pertussis toxin treatment of transfected CHO cells expressing the m2 mAChR, we found that the G alpha i3 C > S protein underwent guanine nucleotide exchange in response to the muscarinic agonist carbachol, while the m2 mAChR failed to activate the endogenous G alpha i2 and G alpha i3 proteins. Moreover, coupling of heterotrimeric G proteins containing G alpha i3 C > S to the m2 mAChR resulted in pertussis toxin-resistant inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, stimulation of phospholipase C-induced intracellular Ca2+ release, and phospholipase A2-mediated arachidonic acid release. Therefore, these studies provide conclusive evidence that heterotrimeric G proteins containing just G alpha i3 can regulate multiple effector enzymes within the same cell type."
https://openalex.org/W2167314017,"The strictly aerobic, polyphosphate-accumulating Acinetobacter johnsonii strain 210A degrades its polyphosphate when oxidative phosphorylation is impaired. The endproducts of this degradation, divalent metal ions and inorganic phosphate, are excreted as a neutral metal-phosphate (MeHPO4) chelate via the electrogenic MeHPO4/H+ symport system of the organism. The coupled excretion of MeHPO4 and H+ in A. johnsonii 210A can generate a proton motive force. In membrane vesicles and deenergized cells, a membrane potential of about -70 mV and transmembrane pH gradient of about -8 mV were formed in response to an imposed outwardly directed MeHPO4 concentration gradient of 120 mV (initial value). The MeHPO4 efflux-induced proton motive force could drive energy-requiring processes, such as the accumulation of L-proline and L-lysine and the synthesis of ATP via the membrane-bound F0F1 H(+)-ATPase. In vivo 31P NMR studies of polyphosphate degradation in anaerobic cell suspensions revealed the presence of a considerable outwardly directed phosphate gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane corresponding to a MgHPO4 concentration gradient of at least 100 mV. This MgHPO4 concentration gradient was maintained for several hours. Thus, energy recycling by MeHPO4/H+ efflux will contribute significantly to the overall production of metabolic energy from the degradation of polyphosphate in A. johnsonii 210A."
https://openalex.org/W2110758456,"Transcytosis of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) can be experimentally divided into three steps: 1) internalization from the basolateral plasma membrane and delivery to basolateral early endosomes, 2) microtubule-dependent movement from basolateral early endosomes to apical recycling endosomes, and 3) delivery from apical recycling endosomes to the apical surface and cleavage of the pIgR to secretory component, which is released into the apical medium. Transcytosis of the pIgR is stimulated by two signals, phosphorylation of Ser-664 in the cytoplasmic domain of the pIgR and binding of the ligand, dimeric IgA, to the pIgR. These signals do not detectably alter step 1 of transcytosis. Here, we show that phosphorylation of Ser-664 stimulates both steps 2 and 3, whereas binding of dimeric IgA stimulates only step 3 of transcytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1679893363,"We recently purified from rat liver microsomes a carboxylesterase, designated hydrolase B, that catalyzes the hydrolysis of para-nitrophenylacetate with low affinity (Km approximately 400 microM) and is relatively insensitive to the inhibitory effects of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A carboxylesterase with identical properties is also present in rat kidney microsomes, at levels comparable to those in liver microsomes. The kidney enzyme is immunochemically indistinguishable from hydrolase B by Western immunoblotting and Ouchterlony double diffusion analysis. This study describes the cloning and sequencing of hydrolase B. A 1809-base pair (bp) cDNA was isolated from a rat kidney cDNA library screened with antibody against hydrolase B. Screening the same cDNA library by two-step polymerase chain reaction with external and internal primers based on the sequence of the 1809-bp cDNA and a primer based on the sequence of the adjoining lambda gt11 arm yielded a 279-bp cDNA that overlapped by 179 bp with the 1809-bp-sequence. Together these two cDNAs spanned a 1909-bp sequence with an opening reading frame encoding 561 amino acids, which includes all 543 amino acid residues in the mature protein plus an 18-amino acid signal peptide at the N terminus. The mature protein encoded by this kidney cDNA matches perfectly the N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified hydrolase B for 30 amino acid residues, as determined by automated Edman degradation. The mature protein contains 5 cysteine residues, two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and a C-terminal tetrapeptide (His-Asn-Glu-Leu) that matches the HXEL consensus sequence for retaining proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Based on alignment of conserved amino acid sequences in several mammalian carboxylesterases, and based on the mechanism of catalysis of serine proteases, the catalytic triad in hydrolase B is apparently composed of the nucleophile Ser203, the basic amino acid His448, and the acidic amino acid Asp97 or Glu228. Northern blots probed with the 1809-bp cDNA identified high levels of a approximately 2-kilobase mRNA for hydrolase B in liver and kidney. Little or no mRNA for hydrolase B was detected in testis, lung, prostate, brain, and heart, which confirms the tissue distribution of hydrolase B based on catalytic activity and Western immunoblotting. Immunocytochemical studies established that hydrolase B is localized in the centrilobular region of the liver and in the proximal tubules of the kidney, where it presumably plays a role in the metabolism of xenobiotics and possibly endogenous lipids, although a precise physiological role for hydrolase B remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1584969825,"Regulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae membrane-associated phosphatidate phosphatase (3-sn-phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.4) activity by nucleotides was examined using pure enzyme and Triton X-100/phosphatidate-mixed micelles. Adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and uridine nucleotides inhibited phosphatidate phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent manner. ATP and CTP were the most potent inhibitors of the enzyme. A kinetic analysis was performed to determine the mechanism of enzyme inhibition by nucleotides. The mechanism of inhibition by ATP and CTP with respect to phosphatidate (the substrate) was complex. The dependence of phosphatidate phosphatase activity on phosphatidate was cooperative, and nucleotides affected both Vmax and Km. ATP did not inhibit phosphatidate phosphatase activity by binding to the enzyme or to phosphatidate. Phosphatidate phosphatase dependence on Mg2+ ions (the cofactor) followed saturation kinetics, and the mechanism of nucleotide inhibition with respect to Mg2+ ions was competitive. Thus, the mechanism of enzyme inhibition by nucleotides was the chelation of Mg2+ ions. The inhibitor constant for ATP was lower than its cellular concentration in glucose-grown cells. However, the inhibitor constant for ATP was higher than its cellular concentration in glucose-starved cells. Changes in the cellular concentration of ATP affected the proportional synthesis of triacylglycerols and phospholipids. These results were consistent with the regulation of phosphatidate phosphatase activity by ATP through a Mg2+ ion chelation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1591492241,"Previously, we have shown that myocytes from rat portal vein express alpha 1A-adrenoreceptors that couple with a Gq/G11-protein to stimulate phosphoinositide turnover and release of calcium from intracellular stores. The purpose of this study was to investigate the contribution of both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoreceptor subtypes in inducing stimulation of voltage-operated calcium channels. Norepinephrine (a nonselective alpha-adrenoreceptor agonist), phenylephrine (an alpha 1-adrenoreceptor agonist), clonidine, and oxymetazoline (alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonists) stimulated the calcium channel current by a similar extent. Using subtype-selective antagonists we showed that both alpha 1A- and alpha 2A-adrenoreceptors modulated voltage-operated calcium channels through two distinct transduction pathways. alpha 1A-Adrenoreceptors coupled with a pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein whereas alpha 2A-adrenoreceptors coupled with a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. Portal vein myocytes expressed G-proteins that were recognized by anti-alpha q/alpha 11, -alpha i(1-2), and -alpha i(3) antibodies. As internal applications of anti-phosphatidylinositol and anti-alpha q/alpha 11 antibodies had no effect on the alpha 2A-adrenoreceptor-induced enhancement of calcium channel current, these findings suggest that phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and Gq/G11-protein are not involved in the alpha 2A-adrenoreceptor-induced coupling process. A protein kinase C inhibitor, GF 109203X, and a long term (24 h) treatment with phorbol dibutyrate to decrease the activity of protein kinase C blocked the alpha 1A- and alpha 2A-adrenoreceptor-induced stimulation of calcium channels as well as that stimulation induced by phorbol dibutyrate. Moreover, activation of alpha 2A-adrenoreceptors did not induce a significant calcium release from intracellular stores. These data suggest that two distinct G-proteins, probably Gq/G11 and Gi, coupled to alpha 1A- and alpha 2A-adrenoreceptors regulate calcium influx through voltage-operated calcium channels by two different transduction pathways leading to activation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1490554701,"The plasmid-encoded virulence factor yersinia adhesin A (YadA) contributes to pathogenicity of Yersinia enterocolitica which might be related to its adhesive potential. Therefore, we have investigated the interaction of Y. enterocolitica with basement membrane (BM) and with the major BM proteins collagen type IV, laminin, and nidogen/entactin. Recombinant YadA-positive but not YadA-negative yersiniae bound specifically to lens capsule BM tissue, as well as purified collagen type IV and the laminin-1 and -2 (formally known as merosin) isoforms. Binding sites are located on the alpha 1 chain of the 58-nm amino-terminal 7sL fragment of collagen type IV and on the elastase-fragment E1 of laminin-1. YadA-mediated binding of yersiniae to collagen type IV was rapid and saturable, it was independent of divalent cations, stable over a wide pH range, and not influenced by higher salt concentrations. D-Glucose and D-galactose did not interfere with binding, indicating a protein-protein interaction. In contrast, adhesion of yersiniae to the laminin-2 isoform occurred also independent of YadA expression and no binding was observed to nidogen/entactin. The results support the hypothesis that adhesion of Y. enterocolitica could contribute to pathogenicity of enteropathogenic yersiniae. Further definition of binding sites for YadA on BM proteins might allow determination of the relevance of Yersinia-BM interactions to infection."
https://openalex.org/W1524088536,"Cathepsin G, a cationic serine proteinase present in neutrophils and monocytes, is able to cleave biologically important proteins and may thus participate in tissue destruction during inflammation. Its activity is physiologically controlled by the fast-acting serpins, alpha 1-anti-chymotrypsin (ka = 5 x 10(7) M-1 S-1) and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (ka = 2.7 x 10(5) M-1 S-1). We have shown that cathepsin G forms a tightly bound 1:1 complex with a 5-kDa heparin fragment (Kd = 1.9 x 10-8 M). The partial enzymatic activity retained by this complex is inhibited extremely slowly by the above 68- and 53-kDa serpins. The activity of the complex is also virtually resistant to inhibition by eglin c, and 8-kDa non-serpin inhibitor. A detailed kinetic investigation showed that the inhibition of heparin-bound cathepsin G by the three proteins proceeded via a two-step mechanism. [formula: see text] The three inhibitors have widely different Ki* values (0.18-13 microM) (Ki* = k-1/k1). Their isomerization constants k2 are, however, all in the same range and their extremely low values (0.7-3 ms-1) account for the very low rate of cathepsin G inhibition. The second-order inhibition rate constants k2/Ki* were 4300, 700, and 52 M-1 S-1 for alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and eglin c, respectively, indicating that, if heparin is present in vivo, the two former physiological inhibitors will be unable to prevent cathepsin G-mediated proteolysis. Neutrophil elastase binds the 5-kDa heparin fragment with an affinity identical to that of cathepsin G. alpha 1-Proteinase inhibitor reacts, however, much faster with heparin-elastase (ka = 1.8 x 10(6) M-1 S-1) than with heparin-cathepsin G (k2/Ki* = 700 M-1 S-1)."
https://openalex.org/W2123460300,"The role of the amino terminus in the actions of ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) was examined by comparing wild type ARF1, a 13-residue NH2-terminal deletion mutant ([delta 13]ARF1), and a 17-residue NH2-terminal deletion mutant ([delta 17]ARF1). The amino-terminal 13 residues of ARF1 are required for cofactor activity in the ADP-ribosylation by cholera toxin when Gs is the substrate. This is in marked contrast to the finding that cofactor activity is the same for wild type and [delta 13]ARF1 when agmatine is substrate (Hong, J.-X., Haun, R. S., Tsai, S.-C., Moss, J., and Vaughan, M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 9743-9745). These data support the conclusion that ARF1 interacts with both cholera toxin and Gs and that the amino terminus of ARF1 is required specifically for binding Gs. Surprisingly, this result also clearly revealed that the two principal assays for ARF activity, cofactor activity for cholera toxin using either Gs or agmatine as substrates, used for over 10 years in different laboratories, can yield quite different results. While both NH2-terminal deletion mutants failed to support the ADP-ribosylation of Gs by cholera toxin, [delta 13]ARF1, but not [delta 17]ARF1, inhibited the activity of the wild type protein. The GTPase activity of [delta 13]ARF1 was activated to a small extent by ARF GTPase-activating protein (GAP), whereas that of [delta 17]ARF1 was unaffected. We conclude that residues 14-17 are involved in the interaction of ARF with both cholera toxin and ARF GAP. The co-purifying nucleotides, nucleotide exchange kinetics, and dependence of exchange on phospholipids for the mutant proteins were all different from the wild type ARF1 proteins. The importance of monitoring the nucleotide binding to ARF proteins under the conditions used in the ARF assay and expressing ARF activities as specific activities, normalized to GTP binding sites, particularly when comparisons between different proteins or preparations are made, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1601074047,"The dicluster-type ferredoxin is a key electron carrier in the cytoplasm of the aerobic and thermoacidophilic archaeon, Sulfolobus sp. strain 7, and contains 1 aspartate and 7 cysteine residues as possible ligands to two FeS clusters. The optical, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and cyclic voltammetric studies suggest the presence of one each of [3Fe-4S]1+,0 (-280 mV) and [4Fe-4S]2+,1+ (-530 mV) clusters in the purified Sulfolobus ferredoxin, and the lower potential [4Fe-4S] center was scarcely reducible by excess dithionite even at pH 9.

Biochem. 128, 223-230), it is not known whether one or both of two clusters is reduced during the steady-state turnover of the enzyme. Here we show by combinations of the optical and EPR spectroscopies that only the higher potential [3Fe-4S] cluster is reduced at the physiological pH during the steady-state turnover of the purified 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase at 50 degrees C. The functional significance and evolutionary implications of the [3Fe-4S] center in dicluster-type ferredoxins are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1563774067,"Clone 112 cells, a rat embryo fibroblast cell line cotransfected by an activated ras gene and a temperature-sensitive mutant p53 gene (p53val135) grow well at 37 degrees C but cease DNA synthesis and cell division when shifted to 32 degrees C (Michalovitz, D., Halevy, O., and Oren, M. (1990) Cell 62, 671-680). Characterization of the p53 protein in exponentially growing clone 112 cells at 37 degrees C revealed that both wild-type (reactive with the monoclonal antibody PAb 246) and mutant (reactive with PAb 240) p53 conformational forms are co-expressed. These results indicate that in clone 112 cells the growth suppressor activity of the wild-type p53 species is inactivated at 37 degrees C. We show that clone 112 cells grown at 37 degrees C elicits specific growth inhibition response to stimulation by the tumor promoter phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). At 37 degrees C, PMA induced nuclear accumulation of the p53 protein, a behavior that is also observed in growth-arrested cells at 32 degrees C. Furthermore, when cells are growth arrested at 32 degrees C, PMA prevented the cells from re-entering the cell cycle when they are shifted back to 37 degrees C. All these observations suggest that PMA can cooperate with the wild-type p53 in cell growth arrest. At 37 and 32 degrees C, PMA stimulation of clone 112 cells resulted in specific enhancement of phosphorylation of the wild-type p53 species but not of the mutant form. We also demonstrate that the growth arrest of clone 112 cells at 37 degrees C is correlated with stimulation of the nuclear wild-type p53-DNA binding activities. The PMA-mediated increase in p53 DNA binding activity coincides with the loss of the PAb 421 epitope on the p53.DNA complex. PAb 421 non-reactivity with p53 has been shown by others to occur in growth-arrested cells and upon phosphorylation of p53 by protein kinase C. We also provide evidence that, in vitro, the protein kinase C mode of phosphorylation stimulates DNA binding activities of purified recombinant wild-type p53 and that in a mutant conformation p53 is not a substrate for protein kinase C. We propose that wild-type p53 and protein kinase C, the cellular receptor of phorbol ester, could participate in the negative feedback controls associated with the phosphoinositide-derived signals common to a number of mitogenic stimulations."
https://openalex.org/W1509304378,"Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH; EC 1.14.17.1) catalyzes the production of the neurotransmitter and hormone norepinephrine in the third step of the catecholamine biosynthesis pathway. Transgenic mice were generated with multiple copies of a human DBH minigene construct containing the full-length cDNA connected downstream of the 4-kilobase upstream promoter region to achieve overexpression of DBH. Human DBH mRNA and immunoreactivity were detected tissue-specifically in the brain and adrenal gland of these transgenic mice. The transgene products were correctly processed to a glycosylated mature polypeptide with a molecular mass of 72 kDa and existed in the secretory vesicles as both soluble and membrane-bound forms. We detected a marked increase in DBH activity in various catecholamine-containing tissues of the mice that occurred as a consequence of expression of the catalytically active human DBH enzyme. However, in these transgenics the steady-state levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine were normally maintained without the acceleration of the catecholamine turnover rate, suggesting that there are some regulatory mechanisms to preserve a constant rate of norepinephrine synthesis in spite of the increased amount of DBH protein. These transgenic mice with the minigene construct provide one approach to study the mechanisms underlying biogenesis of the DBH polypeptide and regulation of norepinephrine synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1662869220,"A major focus in studies of muscle contraction has been the effect of Ca2+ on the interactions among the thin filament's five constituent polypeptides: actin, tropomyosin, troponin C (TnC), troponin T (TnT), and troponin I (TnI). We have investigated these interactions by analyzing thin filament assembly as a linear lattice binding problem with linkage relationships in the associations of tropomyosin, actin, and troponin. Binding of TnT, the binary TnT.TnI complex, or the ternary troponin complex (+/- Ca2+) to tropomyosin was measured spectrofluorimetrically after labeling cardiac tropomyosin with N-(1-pyrene)iodoacetamide. The affinity constants ranged between 0.2 and 0.6 microM-1 in the presence of 300 mM KCl. Also, the affinities of tropomyosin, tropomyosin-troponin, tropomyosin.TnT, and tropomyosin.TnT.TnI for an isolated site on F-actin were determined. The actin association constants were 0.0006 microM-1 for tropomyosin, 1 microM-1 for tropomyosin.TnT, 2 microM-1 for tropomyosin.TnT.TnI, 0.5 microM-1 for tropomyosin.troponin, and 0.5 microM-1 for tropomyosin-troponin.Ca2+. Linked equilibrium analysis permitted calculation of the affinities for actin.tropomyosin of TnT (400 microM-1), TnT.TnI (1600 microM-1), troponin (500 microM-1), and troponin.Ca2+ (300 microM-1). Therefore, both troponin and tropomyosin.troponin retain high actin-affinity even when Ca2+ is present or when TnI is removed, and even in the absence of cooperative contributions. The results are discussed in consideration of increasing evidence for a Ca(2+)-regulated azimuthal movement of tropomyosin on F-actin (Lehman, W., Craig, R., and Vibert, P. (1994) Nature 368, 65-67). It is proposed that tropomyosin movement may be due to switching between TnI-mediated and TnT-mediated binding of troponin-tropomyosin to distinct sites on F-actin."
https://openalex.org/W1567286909,"Using sheep cerebellum microsomes adsorbed on a filter, we measured the kinetics of [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) binding and dissociation on the subsecond time scale during rapid perfusion of the filter with [3H]InsP3-containing or InsP3-free media. At 20 degrees C and pH 7.1, in a cytosol-like medium containing MgCl2, the half-time for InsP3 dissociation was as short as 125 ms. The receptor behaved as a simple target for binding of its ligand, with the rate constant for InsP3 binding increasing linearly with InsP3 concentration. Various modulators of InsP3 binding (KCl, NaCl, pH, Mg2+, and Ca2+) were found to affect the receptor's apparent affinity for InsP3 mainly by altering the rate constant for [3H]InsP3 dissociation. ATP (but not InsP3) also accelerated [3H]InsP3 dissociation. In contrast to these modulators, luminal Ca2+ was found to have no effect on the amount of microsome-bound [3H]InsP3."
https://openalex.org/W1519042393,"We investigated the interfacial behavior of recombinant human cholesterol ester transfer protein (rCETP) using monolayer and surface balance techniques. rCETP bound to egg phosphatidylcholine monolayers spread at the air/water interface with a maximum surface pressure of 23 millinewtons (mN)/m at subphase concentrations between 3 and 5 x 10(-5) g/dl; the estimated dissociation constant was 7.5 x 10(-6) g/dl or 1 nM. The binding of rCETP to the lipid interface decreased linearly with increasing initial surface pressure; rCETP was excluded at pressures greater than 31 mN/m. rCETP catalyzed the desorption of [14C]cholesterol oleate from mixed lipid monolayers in a concentration dependent fashion. Similar studies with apolipoproteins A-I and A-IV established that cholesterol ester desorption was not caused by changes in surface pressure or cholesterol ester solubility. The desorption rate was proportional to subphase rCETP concentration, but at all concentrations surface radioactivity remained constant until surface pressure reached a plateau. The calculated binding stochiometry was one molecule of cholesterol ester desorbed for every 1000 molecules of rCETP in the subphase. We conclude that rCETP is surface active, binds to phospholipid monolayers with an affinity equivalent to that of the plasma apolipoproteins, and effects the desorption of cholesterol ester molecules from phospholipid monolayers by a carrier mechanism. Moreover, the relatively low equilibrium surface pressure of rCETP suggests that when bound to lipid the entire rCETP molecule may not penetrate the interface."
https://openalex.org/W1554250095,"Streptolysin O-permeabilized pancreatic acini were used to study compartmentalization of Ca2+ signaling and Ca2+ pools. In these cells, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent Ca2+ channels could be activated by a number of agonists (carbachol, cholecystokinin, or bombesin) or by activation of the entire cellular phospholipase C pool with GTP gamma S. Surprisingly, each of the antagonists interacting with acinar cells inactivated the channels after stimulation with GTP gamma S. In addition, when permeabilized cells were stimulated with more than one agonist, any antagonist to the specific agonists employed inactivated the channels. The aberrant behavior of the antagonists in permeable cells was not related to a loss of specificity since (a) when added before GTP gamma S, the antagonists had no effect on Ca2+ release and (b) when cells were stimulated with a single agonist, the antagonists prevented only the effect of their specific agonist. The differential behavior of the antagonists in intact and permeable cells suggests a compartmentalization of Ca2+ signaling into separate, agonist-specific units that is modified by cell permeabilization. Further evidence for compartmentalization of signaling was obtained by showing that the partial agonist (the CCK octapeptide analogue JMV-180) can access and release only 50% of the cholecystokinin- or IP3-mobilizable Ca2+ pool in intact and permeable cells. Kinetic measurements revealed a multiphasic time course of agonist-evoked Ca2+ release in permeable cells. At high agonist concentrations, all phases were fast and merged into an apparent single event of Ca2+ release. The phases were separated by three independent protocols: reduction in agonist concentrations, addition of heparin, or addition of guanosine-5'-O-(thio)diphosphate. Since all protocols that caused phase separation reduce IP3-mediated Ca2+ release, these findings demonstrate heterogeneity in the affinity for IP3 of channels present in compartmentalized Ca2+ pools of the same cells. Compartmentalization of signaling and the heterogeneity in the affinity for IP3 resulted in a quantal agonist-evoked Ca2+ release. The overall findings are discussed in the context of an integrated model of compartmentalization of signaling complexes, Ca2+ pools, and IP3-activated Ca2+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1557778578,"A silent gene encoding a kinase that specifically phosphorylates L-xylulose was activated and rendered constitutive in mutant cells of Escherichia coli. L-Xylulose kinase was purified to homogeneity and found to be a dimer of two subunits of 55 kDa, highly specific for L-xylulose with a Km of 0.8 mM, a Vmax of 33 mumol/min/mg, and an optimum pH of 8.4. Physical (thin layer chromatography) and spectroscopic (nuclear magnetic resonance and optical rotation) characterization of the product of L-xylulose kinase indicated that the enzyme phosphorylated the sugar at position 5. The gene encoding L-xylulose kinase was mapped in the 80.2 min region of the chromosome by conjugation and transduction. Cloning and comparison of the restriction map with the Kohara map (Kohara, Y., Akiyame, K., and Isono, K. (1987) Cell 50, 495-501) located the gene between positions 3963 and 3965 kilobases. The molecular and functional features of L-xylulose kinase together with the location of the corresponding gene indicate that this enzyme did not derive from mutation of any other known kinase. The new kinase opens a route for the utilization of L-lyxose through the action of rhamnose permease, rhamnose isomerase, and the phosphorylation of the L-xylulose formed to L-xylulose 5-phosphate, which is then introduced into the pentose phosphate pathway for subsequent metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1539312369,"The clpA gene that encodes the ATPase subunit of the ATP-dependent protease Ti (Clp) in Escherichia coli contains a putative internal translational initiation site. Here we show that mutagenesis of its 5'-end AUG codon resulted in an exclusive synthesis of the 65-kDa protein (ClpA65), while mutation at the internal 169th AUG codon (Met) to ACG (Thr) produced only the 84-kDa protein (ClpA84T). On the other hand, the cells carrying the wild-type clpA gene produced both the 84- and 65-kDa proteins (ClpA84/65). While the purified ClpA84T and ClpA84/65 hydrolyzed ATP nearly as well as the 84-kDa ClpA alone (ClpA84), ClpA65 cleaved ATP at a rate less than 5% of that by ClpA84. Unlike ClpA84 and ClpA84T, ClpA65 could not support the casein-degrading activity of ClpP. Furthermore, ClpA65 inhibited the proteolysis by the mixture of ClpP with ClpA84 or ClpA84T but not that with ClpA84/65, which could support the proteolytic activity of ClpP only about 40% as well as ClpA84. Nevertheless, ClpA65 showed little or no effect on the basal or protein-activated ATPase activity of ClpA84, ClpA84T, or ClpA84/65 alone or in the presence of ClpP. These results suggest that ClpA65 may interfere the interaction of ClpA84 or ClpA84T with ClpP and, hence, impair their assembly into an active form of the ATP-dependent protease Ti."
https://openalex.org/W1547245063,"Abstract We have used a monoclonal antibody-based binding procedure to determine the dissociation constants of the interactions between the essential antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide and a series of 13 distinct N- and C-terminal antithrombin substitution mutation variants with defective binding interaction with heparin. The reduction in binding affinity of the pentasaccharide with the N-terminal variants (with substitution mutations Pro-41-->Leu, Arg-47-->Cys and His, Leu-99-->Val and Phe, Gln-118-->Pro, Arg-129-->Gln) compared to normal antithrombin, Kd 200 nM, ranged from 15-984-fold and was generally less than 150-fold. Reduced binding affinity is assumed to arise mostly by perturbation, direct or indirect, of the initial contact of pentasaccharide with basic residues of antithrombin. Surprisingly, the binding interaction of the pentasaccharide with the C-terminal variants (with substitution mutations in or near strand 1C/4B, Phe-402-->Leu, Cys, and Ser, Ala-404-->Thr, Pro-407-->Thr, Pro-429-->Leu) was more uniformly and yet substantially (135-482-fold) decreased, despite the spatial separation between the site of mutation and the proposed primary contact site of the pentasaccharide. These results demonstrate that strand 1C/4B region integrity is required for optimum interaction with the pentasaccharide, suggesting its involvement in transmission of the induced conformation change required for high affinity binding."

In vitro Ser-tRNA[Ser]Sec served as a suppressor of the UGA Sec codon as well as the UGA stop codon, while Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec did not. However, in vivo Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec did donate Sec to glutathione peroxidase in Xenopus oocytes microinjected with glutathione peroxidase mRNA and Sec-tRNA. A ribosome binding assay was devised to investigate the interaction of aminoacyl-tRNA, rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes, and eukaryotic elongation factor 1 (eEF-1) in response to the appropriate trinucleoside diphosphate template. Ser-tRNA[Ser]Sec bound weakly to ribosomes in the presence of eEF-1 and UGA as compared to Phe-tRNA, Ser-tRNAIGA, and Met-tRNAm which bound more efficiently in the presence of eEF-1 and the appropriate template. No increase in the binding of Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec was observed under the same conditions as Ser-tRNA[Ser]Sec. The ribosome binding studies substantiated the finding that Ser-tRNA[Ser]Sec serves as a suppressor of UGA codons in protein synthesis, but Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec does not. In addition, these studies provide strong evidence that a specific elongation factor is required in mammalian cells for insertion of Sec into protein from Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec."
https://openalex.org/W1573733459,"N-Formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) is able to accelerate Ca2+ entry into differentiated HL60 cells by a rather indirect mechanism consisting of the opening of a plasma membrane pathway activated by the emptying of the intracellular Ca2+ stores caused by the agonist. This Ca2+ pathway can also be fully activated by Ca2+ store depletion with thapsigargin. We show here that, in addition to this store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway (SOCP), fMLP is able to activate another receptor-operated Ca2+ pathway in thapsigargin-treated HL60 cells differentiated for 24 h with dimethyl sulfoxide. Activation by fMLP was produced even in cells with fully empty Ca2+ stores. It started 30 s after fMLP addition, was maximal after 2 min and then disappeared within 5 min. This pathway was similar to SOCP in that it allowed passage of Mn2+ and Ba2+ and was antagonized by Ni2+ and by cytochrome P-450 inhibitors. fMLP is also able to inhibit SOCP by a mechanism involving protein phosphorylation. Both the fMLP-induced activation of Ca2+ entry and the inhibition of SOCP were prevented by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. However, the first appeared earlier than the last along differentiation of HL60 cells. This suggests that the inhibition of SOCP requires not only the development of fMLP receptors but also an additional component placed distally to the G protein in the transduction mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1925357871,"Previous studies have shown that the production of interstitial collagenase by rat myometrial smooth muscle cells is dependent on serotonin. These cells fail to produce collagenase early in culture, however, and produce the enzyme only 8-12 days after confluence. During the early quiescent period, collagenase production can be induced by low concentrations of bacterial endotoxin. Under these conditions, interleukin (IL)-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNAs increase coincident with collagenase and collagenase mRNA. Serotonin removal decreases IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNAs, and effect that is rapidly reversed upon readdition of serotonin. Conversely, serotonin-dependent increases in IL-1 mRNAs are blocked by progesterone. Experiments with 5-HT2 receptor agonists and antagonists indicate that induction is mediated by the 5-HT2 receptor subtype. In serotonin-treated cells late in culture, IL-1 mRNAs increase coincident with the production of collagenase. Similarly, exogenous IL-1 fully substitutes for lipopolysaccharide in stimulating myometrial cells to produce collagenase early in culture. Cells treated with IL-1 receptor antagonist fail to make IL-1 mRNAs or collagenase but produce collagenase and IL-1 mRNAs following antagonist removal. These results indicate that serotonin-dependent IL-1 production by the myometrial cell is required for collagenase production and that IL-1 participates in its own production via an autocrine mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W128377646,"1H NMR spectra of a series of distal point mutants of human and sperm whale deoxy myoglobin have been recorded and their spectral parameters compared with those of wild type. The substitutions investigated include His64(E7)-->Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, and Gln and Val68(E11)-->Ala, Ile. The three resonances from the proximal His F8 imidazole ring, as well as two heme methyl signals, are identified in each of the proteins. Significant perturbations of the NMR spectra of mutant deoxy myoglobins (Mbs) occurred only upon substitution of His64(E7) by any non-polar residue, with only minor variation in parameters throughout the range of side chains. These spectral changes are attributed to the elimination of a non-coordinated ordered water molecule in the distal pocket found hydrogen bonded to His64(E7) in crystals of wild-type deoxy Mb, but abolished in the His64(E7)-->Leu mutant deoxy Mb crystal (Quillin, M. L., Arduini, R. M., Olson, J. S., and Philips, G. N., Jr. (1993) J. Mol. Biol. 234, 140-155). The observed spectral changes, increased His F8 ring spin delocalization, and decreased heme in-plane asymmetry, can be directly attributed to the weakening of the effective axial field and a decrease in the asymmetry in the rhombic ligand field resulting from removal of the water molecule. The hyperfine shift patterns for the mutants His64(E7)-->Gln and Val68(E11)-->Ile deoxy Mbs are minimally perturbed from that of wild type and are interpreted to reflect a conserved distal water-binding site. In the point mutant Val68(E11)-->Ala, the decreased covalency to the axial His F8 is interpreted as reflecting a conserved distal water molecule that can interact more strongly with the iron due to the reduced steric bulk of the E11 side chain. The differential 1H NMR spectral parameters for the His F8 resonances in the two subunits of T state deoxy Hb A are shown to be similarly consistent with the known occupation of the distal water binding site in the alpha-, but not beta-subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1608694972,"Control of the regulatory enzyme threonine deaminase from Escherichia coli is achieved by isoleucine inhibition and valine activation. The mechanism by which these heterotropic effectors regulate the enzyme was investigated by measuring the binding of isoleucine and valine by spectroscopic, kinetic, calorimetric and equilibrium dialysis techniques. The addition of isoleucine or valine to threonine deaminase resulted in large changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of the two tryptophans per polypeptide chain. Slightly cooperative binding isotherms for isoleucine were obtained in potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, yielding an average dissociation constant of 4.91 microM, which was confirmed by equilibrium dialysis measurements. Valine binding was much more cooperative, and yielded an average dissociation constant of 122 microM. Titration calorimetry experiments indicated that cooperative heterotropic ligand binding was exothermic, and yielded a stoichiometry of four isoleucine bound per tetrameric enzyme, with an average enthalpy of -10.70 kcal/mol. Valine also bound to four sites per tetramer, with an average enthalpy of -7.45 kcal/mol. The effect of ligands on the fluorescence and circular dichroism spectra of the essential pyridoxal phosphate cofactor indicates that isoleucine and valine bind to effector sites that are distinct from the active sites in threonine deaminase. Shifts in the kinetic properties of threonine deaminase promoted by isoleucine and valine binding are to a first approximation consistent with analyses of effector binding isotherms in terms of a simple two-state model, and suggest that isoleucine regulates threonine deaminase by preferentially binding to the low activity T state, whereas valine binds preferentially to the high activity R state. Finally, analyses of heterotropic effector binding isotherms suggest that active site ligands may have significant affinity for the regulatory sites, which gives rise to underestimates for the allosteric equilibrium constants determined from substrate analog binding isotherms."
https://openalex.org/W1492581626,"The alpha- and beta-chains of the heterodimeric major histocompatibility complex molecules HLA-DRB5*0101 and DRB1*0101 were expressed separately in Escherichia coli. The cytoplasmic and membrane-spanning domains of both chains were replaced by oligohistidine tags to allow purification by metal chelate chromatography. The recombinant proteins were refolded to peptide-free, water-soluble heterodimers by removal of major amounts of detergents and concomitant reoxidiation of disulfide bonds. Correct conformation was documented by three criteria: (a) affinity binding experiments using the antibody L243, which is known to recognize a conformational epitope formed only by correctly associated heterodimers; (b) specific binding of peptides to the refolded molecules; (c) recognition of peptides bound to refolded HLA-DR molecules by T-cells as reflected by Ca2+ influx into T-cells and production of interferon-gamma. The refolding reaction did not absolutely depend on the presence of peptides. The yield of peptide-free heterodimers was 3.0%. However, the yield of refolded heterodimer was increased to 10% if refolding was performed in the presence of antigenic peptides."

Binding isotherms were determined in potassium phosphate at pH 7.5 by detection of an 8-10-fold increase in intrinsic fluorescence of the external aldimine Schiff base of these analogs with the essential pyridoxal phosphate cofactor of the enzyme. Both 2-aminobutyrate and alanine bind cooperatively to four sites on threonine deaminase, with an average dissociation constant of 12.7 and 43.8 mM, respectively. The feedback inhibitor isoleucine decreases the average affinity for the ligands and increases the degree of cooperativity. The activator valine decreases the degree of cooperativity, but gives rise to a slight increase in the average dissociation constant for 2-aminobutyrate and alanine, possibly due to a competitive effect with active site ligands. The temperature dependence of the average affinity of ligands for the active sites indicates that binding is entropically controlled, with average values for delta H0 of +6.0 kcal/mol for alanine and +4.87 kcal/mol for 2-aminobutyrate. Since none of the ligands under investigation had any effect on the tetrameric quaternary structure of the enzyme as judged by sedimentation equilibrium, an initial attempt to describe cooperative ligand association with threonine deaminase was undertaken by analysis of the binding isotherms in terms of a two-state model in which the enzyme equilibrates between two conformations, T and R, that differ in their affinity for ligands. This analysis suggests that cooperative binding to the enzyme is largely the result of the high preferential affinity of ligands for the R state. In addition, estimates for the allosteric equilibrium constant L range from 2 to 5, in the absence of modifiers, to 35 in the presence of isoleucine, and 0.9 in the presence of valine. To a first approximation, the data are consistent with isoleucine and valine regulating threonine deaminase by shifting the allosteric equilibrium between the different affinity forms."
https://openalex.org/W1576269573,"Current models of chaperonin-assisted suggest that proteins undergo multiple rounds of binding and release before they are released in a form that is committed to to the native state. Using immunoprecipitation techniques, we have determined the rates at which rhodanese and glutamine synthetase (GS) are released from groEL in a form committed to refold to active enzyme. Rhodanese and glutamine synthetase were chosen as substrates because they exhibit different solution requirements for the chaperonin system and they form stable folding arrested complexes with groEL. At various times during the groE-dependent renaturations, groEL was rapidly removed from the renaturation mixture by immunoprecipitation and centrifugation (30 s). The conformers that are committed to the native state remained in the supernatant and were assayed after 1 h. At 25 degrees C, the rate profiles indicate the release and commitment to of GS to its native state occurs far earlier (t1/2 < 1 min) than for rhodanese (t1/2 = 5 min). In light of previous results, it appears that GS monomers can attain a groE-independent assembly competent conformation after a brief interaction with the chaperonin. In contrast, the renaturation rate for rhodanese with the groE chaperonins mirrored the committed renaturation rates following groEL depletion. This suggests that rhodanese must interact with groEL throughout most of its reaction before it acquires a competent (groE independent) state. If current models of chaperonin mechanism are correct, rhodanese undergoes more rebinding and release cycles than does GS. Structurally, the degree of cycling and hence the rate of commitment to to the active form are probably dictated by the hydrophobic nature, number, and lifetimes of the intermediates that interact with the chaperonins."
https://openalex.org/W1489361097,"The rate of relaxation of supercoiled DNA by purified vaccinia topoisomerase I is stimulated 20-fold by 5 mM ATP. A similar effect is elicited by GTP, CTP, UTP, dATP, and adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate. ATP-mediated rate enhancement requires salt as a coactivator. ADP and inorganic pyrophosphate also stimulate relaxation 10-20-fold, whereas AMP and inorganic phosphate have little effect. A model for allosteric activation of topoisomerase by nucleotides is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1571908919,"We have characterized 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylic acid-sensitive, mersalyl-insensitive citrate uptake by mitochondria from two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by describing the time course, Km and Vmax values, pH dependence, and response to inhibitors. In unloaded mitochondria from PSY142 CS1- cells, a mutant that lacks mitochondrial citrate synthase, both citrate uptake and efflux were reduced 7- and 8-fold, respectively, compared with the parental strain. No malate uptake was detectable in mitochondria from CS1- cells, while in the parental strain, uptake was 5.4 nmol/min/mg of protein. In contrast, mutations in peroxisomal citrate synthase (CS2-) or in other tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes did not result in changes in mitochondrial citrate transport, suggesting a specific functional role for mitochondrial citrate synthase in citrate transport. More important, liposomes containing protein extracts from CS1- mitochondria showed the same citrate and malate transport rates as liposomes made from protein extracts of parental strain mitochondria. Thus, an apparently normal amount of both the citrate transporter and the dicarboxylate carrier is present in CS1- mitochondria, but both function abnormally in undisrupted mitochondria. We suggest that cooperation between the citrate transporter and mitochondrial citrate synthase is necessary for normal function of the transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1596855070,"Abstract A novel type of malonate decarboxylase which is induced and located in periplasm of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus grown on malonate as sole carbon and energy source was purified to homogeneity. The purified 185-kDa decarboxylase was found to be an oligomer composed of three different polypeptides in a ratio of 2:1:1, designated alpha (65 kDa), beta (32 kDa), and gamma (25 kDa). Optimum pH was 6.8, while pI was 6.39. The enzyme was highly specific for malonate with Km 1.4 mM. This enzyme contained a biotin prosthetic group on alpha subunit which does not seem to be directly related to malonate decarboxylation. The purified enzyme showed almost no activity; activity was restored, however, by treatment with acetic anhydride or malonyl-CoA, which formed an acetyl-enzyme. The 14C-acylated enzyme was isolated by a gel filtration from the reaction mixtures containing [2-14C]malonyl-CoA and the enzyme or [2-14C]malonate, malonyl-CoA, and the enzyme. When treated by thiol-specific reagents, such as N-ethylmaleimide, 5,5'-dinitro-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid, the purified enzyme showed no increase in activity after the acetic anhydride treatment. The thiol-specific reagents failed to inhibit, however, the catalytically active acetyl-enzyme, suggesting that the site of acylation is the thiol group. Further evidence was provided when sodium borohydride inactivated the acetyl-enzyme. These results suggest that malonate decarboxylation by this enzyme may proceed by a catalytic cycle in which the acetyl group on the active enzyme is displaced by malonate, which binds covalently to a thiol group on the enzyme and is subsequently decarboxylated."
https://openalex.org/W1604389554,"Transglutaminase, a zero length cross-linker that catalyzes the formation of isopeptide bonds between proximal Gln and Lys side chains, was used as a structural and conformational probe of the hexadecameric phosphorylase kinase molecule (alpha beta gamma delta)4. Brief cross-linking of nonactivated kinase caused formation of alpha-beta dimers, with no cross-linking involving the gamma- and delta-subunits. When the kinase was first activated by autophosphorylation, significant amounts of alpha-alpha dimers were also observed in addition to the alpha-beta, demonstrating the occurrence of a conformational change in the alpha-subunits concomitant with activation. Both dimers resulted from intramolecular cross-linking. Because the COOH-terminal regions of the alpha-subunits are at the lobe tips of this bilobal kinase (Wilkinson D. A. Marion, T. N., Tillman, D. M., Norcum, M. T., Hainfeld, J. F., Seyer, J. M., and Carlson, G. M. (1994) J. Mol. Biol. 235, 974-982), the formation of zero length cross-linked alpha-alpha dimers indicates that the polypeptide backbones of these subunits must stretch from the lobe tips to a more central location where they abut each other. Excess putrescine, as the amine substrate in place of endogenous Lys, was incorporated by transglutaminase predominately into the alpha-subunits of the kinase, with only slight modification of the beta- and gamma-subunits. Exogenous calmodulin (delta'), an activator of the kinase with a binding site on the alpha-subunits (James, P., Cohen, P., and Carafoli, E. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7087-7091), was a potent inhibitor of cross-linking. It also inhibited incorporation of putrescine into the alpha-subunits but stimulated incorporation into the beta- and gamma-subunits. Heparin, another activator of the kinase, had the same effects as exogenous calmodulin on cross-linking and putrescine incorporation, suggesting a commonality in the mechanism through which these two effectors activate the holoenzyme, including promoting a conformational change that increases the surface accessibility of target Gln residues on the catalytic gamma-subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2102392152,"In previous transient state kinetic work from this laboratory, we proposed a new mechanism for the glutamate dehydrogenase-catalyzed oxidative deamination reaction involving an initial replacement of a proton from lysine 126 by a single bound water molecule, followed by closure of the active site cleft and expulsion of bulk water, providing a hydrophobic environment for the ensuing hydride transfer step. Here, we report the results of further transient state fluorescence, absorbance, and kinetic isotope effect studies, which demonstrate the occurrence of an unusual intermediate in the early steps of that reaction. This phenomenon is revealed by an initial fluorescence burst that occurs in the time period where the absorbance signal is still in its lag phase. Using an extension of the proton/product ratio approach we have described earlier, we show that this intermediate is a strongly fluorescent but weakly absorbing species whose absorption maximum is red-shifted beyond that of other known complexes of this enzyme. The transient state kinetic isotope effects of the fluorescence and absorbance signals are compatible only with a reaction scheme in which the formation of the fluorescent complex precedes the hydride transfer step. The optical properties of this enzyme-oxidized coenzyme-substrate intermediate strongly suggest that it is a charge-transfer complex, similar in nature to the complex responsible for the well known Racker band reported in 1952 for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatase dehydrogenase (Racker, E., and Krimsky, I. (1952) Nature 169, 1043-1044). The crystal structure studies of the enzyme-coenzyme and enzyme-L-glutamate complexes of the closely analogous Clostridium symbosium glutamate dehydrogenase, reported by the Sheffield group (Stillman, T. J., Baker, P. J., Britton, K. L., and Rice, D. W. (1993) J. Mol. Biol. 234, 1131-1139), provide a basis for a physical explanation of the phenomenon. We conclude that the charge transfer phenomenon is caused by the near apposition of the unprotonated alpha-amino group of the substrate in a form of the enzyme in which a conformational change has caused the complete closing of the active site cleft."
https://openalex.org/W1491817580,"The three-dimensional structures of complexes between bovine plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP) and three retinol analogs with different end groups (fenretinide, all-trans retinoic acid, and axerophthene) have been determined to 1.8-1.9-A resolution. Their models are very similar to that of the bovine retinol.RBP complex: the root mean square deviations between equivalent alpha-carbons in the two proteins range from 0.17 to 0.24 A. The retinoid molecules fit in the beta-barrel cavity assuming the same conformation of the vitamin, and the substitutions have no consequences on the overall protein structure. While confirming that an intact hydroxyl end group is not an absolute requirement for a correct retinoid binding to RBP, this study has shown the occurrence of conformational changes, although limited, in the rather flexible loop region at the entrance of the beta-barrel upon fenretinide and retinoic acid binding. These changes are suitable for accommodating the end groups of the above retinoids. Instead, no such changes have been revealed in RBP complexed with axerophthene, a retinol analog bearing a hydrogen atom in place of the hydroxyl end group. The protein conformational changes in the above loop region, the steric hindrance of bulky end groups of bound retinoids, and the lack of the retinol hydroxyl group appear to be responsible for the possible reduced affinity of retinoids for RBP relative to retinol and, at the same time, for the abolished or reduced affinity of retinoid.RBP complexes for transthyretin relative to retinol-RBP."
https://openalex.org/W1604964167,"Only monoubiquitinated (and to a much lesser extent diubiquitinated) 125I-alpha globin is observed as a conjugated intermediate in the ATP- and ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent proteolysis of 125I-alpha globin catalyzed by an unfractionated reticulocyte lysate (Shaeffer, J.R. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 22205-22210). A monoubiquitinated 125I-alpha globin (Ub1-alpha) fraction was isolated and incubated with a dilute acid reagent to selectively cleave the 125I-alpha globin moiety between residues 94 (Asp) and 95 (Pro). Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the resulting polypeptides showed that the Ub1-alpha conjugate consisted of a mixture of molecules in which 57% had Ub attached to the amino-terminal two-thirds and 43% had Ub attached to the carboxyl-terminal one-third of the 125I-alpha globin monomer. This amino- to carboxyl-terminal region ubiquitination ratio was essentially unchanged when a Ub1-alpha conjugate intermediate, pulse-labeled for 15 min in the presence of ubiquitin aldehyde to inhibit disassembly, was analyzed after (a) a 2-h chase incubation with excess nonradioactive alpha globin or (b) isolation and incubation separately as a proteolysis substrate. Similar analysis of the diubiquitinated 125I-alpha globin (Ub2-alpha) conjugate molecules showed that, after pulse labeling, 58% were diubiquitinated within the amino-terminal two-thirds and 42% were monoubiquitinated within both amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of the 125I-alpha globin moiety (a small amount of molecules diubiquitinated within the carboxyl-terminal region may also be present) and that the relative amounts of these molecular types changed little, if any, during the chase incubation. This invariance in the amino- to carboxyl-terminal region ubiquitination ratio during degradation of the Ub1-alpha and Ub2-alpha conjugates suggests that 125I-alpha globin molecules ubiquitinated within either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal regions were both intermediates in the proteolysis of the unconjugated substrate. This heterogeneous pattern of Ub conjugation may also occur during the proteolysis of other long-lived intracellular proteins."
