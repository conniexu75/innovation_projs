https://openalex.org/W2168846334,"We demonstrate an integrated approach to build, test, and refine a model of a cellular pathway, in which perturbations to critical pathway components are analyzed using DNA microarrays, quantitative proteomics, and databases of known physical interactions. Using this approach, we identify 997 messenger RNAs responding to 20 systematic perturbations of the yeast galactose-utilization pathway, provide evidence that approximately 15 of 289 detected proteins are regulated posttranscriptionally, and identify explicit physical interactions governing the cellular response to each perturbation. We refine the model through further iterations of perturbation and global measurements, suggesting hypotheses about the regulation of galactose utilization and physical interactions between this and a variety of other metabolic pathways."

Empirical pseudopotential calculations predict that slightly elongated CdSe nanocrystals have polarized emission along the long axis, unlike spherical dots, which emit plane-polarized light. Single-molecule luminescence spectroscopy measurements on CdSe quantum rods with an aspect ratio between 1 and 30 confirm a sharp transition from nonpolarized to purely linearly polarized emission at an aspect ratio of 2. Linearly polarized luminescent chromophores are highly desirable in a variety of applications."
https://openalex.org/W2145583354,"Crystal structures of the 30S ribosomal subunit in complex with messenger RNA and cognate transfer RNA in the A site, both in the presence and absence of the antibiotic paromomycin, have been solved at between 3.1 and 3.3 angstroms resolution. Cognate transfer RNA (tRNA) binding induces global domain movements of the 30S subunit and changes in the conformation of the universally conserved and essential bases A1492, A1493, and G530 of 16S RNA. These bases interact intimately with the minor groove of the first two base pairs between the codon and anticodon, thus sensing Watson-Crick base-pairing geometry and discriminating against near-cognate tRNA. The third, or ""wobble,"" position of the codon is free to accommodate certain noncanonical base pairs. By partially inducing these structural changes, paromomycin facilitates binding of near-cognate tRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2069777400,"Vibrational studies that selectively probe molecular structure at CCl4/H2O and hydrocarbon/H2O interfaces show that the hydrogen bonding between adjacent water molecules at these interfaces is weak, in contrast to generally accepted models of water next to fluid hydrophobic surfaces that suggest strong hydrogen bonding. However, interactions between these water molecules and the organic phase result in substantial orientation of these weakly hydrogen-bonded water molecules in the interfacial region. The results have important implications for understanding water adjacent to hydrophobic surfaces and the penetration of water into hydrophobic phases."
https://openalex.org/W2118829512,"We demonstrate controlled rotation of optically trapped objects in a spiral interference pattern. This pattern is generated by interfering an annular shaped laser beam with a reference beam. Objects are trapped in the spiral arms of the pattern. Changing the optical path length causes this pattern, and thus the trapped objects, to rotate. Structures of silica microspheres, microscopic glass rods, and chromosomes are set into rotation at rates in excess of 5 hertz. This technique does not depend on intrinsic properties of the trapped particle and thus offers important applications in optical and biological micromachines."
https://openalex.org/W2003062513,"SCF ubiquitin ligases control various processes by marking regulatory proteins for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. To illuminate how SCF complexes are regulated, we sought proteins that interact with the human SCF component CUL1. The COP9 signalosome (CSN), a suppressor of plant photomorphogenesis, associated with multiple cullins and promoted cleavage of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe CUL1 in vivo and in vitro. Multiple NEDD8-modified proteins uniquely accumulated in CSN-deficient S. pombe cells. We propose that the broad spectrum of activities previously attributed to CSN subunits--including repression of photomorphogenesis, activation of JUN, and activation of p27 nuclear export--underscores the importance of dynamic cycles of NEDD8 attachment and removal in biological regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2115555834,"Atoms interacting with intense laser fields can emit electrons and photons of very high energies. An intuitive and quantitative explanation of these highly nonlinear processes can be found in terms of a generalization of classical Newtonian particle trajectories, the so-called quantum orbits. Very few quantum orbits are necessary to reproduce the experimental results. These orbits are clearly identified, thus opening the way for an efficient control as well as previously unknown applications of these processes."
https://openalex.org/W2002232472,"Most of the oceanic reservoir of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is of marine origin and is resistant to microbial oxidation, but little is known about the mechanisms of its formation. In a laboratory study, natural assemblages of marine bacteria rapidly (in &lt;48 hours) utilized labile compounds (glucose, glutamate) and produced refractory DOM that persisted for more than a year. Only 10 to 15% of the bacterially derived DOM was identified as hydrolyzable amino acids and sugars, a feature consistent with marine DOM. These results suggest that microbial processes alter the molecular structure of DOM, making it resistant to further degradation and thereby preserving fixed carbon in the ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2095548329,"Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that can be distinguished from T and B cells through their involvement in innate immunity and their lack of rearranged antigen receptors. Although NK cells and their receptors were initially characterized in terms of tumor killing in vitro, we have determined that the NK cell activation receptor, Ly-49H, is critically involved in resistance to murine cytomegalovirus in vivo. Ly-49H requires an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing transmembrane molecule for expression and signal transduction. Thus, NK cells use receptors functionally resembling ITAM-coupled T and B cell antigen receptors to provide vital innate host defense."
https://openalex.org/W2079793296,"Leptin, a circulating hormone secreted mainly from adipose tissues, is involved in the control of body weight. The plasma concentrations are correlated with body mass index, and are reported to be high in patients with insulin resistance, which is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. However, the direct effect of leptin on vascular wall cells is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of leptin on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). We found that leptin increases ROS generation in BAEC in a dose-dependent manner and that its effects are additive with those of glucose. Rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), Mn(III)tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP), uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) HVJ-liposomes, or manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) HVJ-liposomes completely prevented the effect of leptin, suggesting that ROS arise from mitochondrial electron transport. Leptin increased fatty acid oxidation by stimulating the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) and inhibiting that of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), pace-setting enzymes for fatty acid oxidation and synthesis, respectively. Leptin-induced ROS generation, CPT-1 activation, ACC inhibition, and MCP-1 overproduction were found to be completely prevented by either genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, H-89, a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, or tetradecylglycidate, a CPT-1 inhibitor. Leptin activated PKA, and the effects of leptin were inhibited by the cAMP antagonist Rp-cAMPS. These results suggest that leptin induces ROS generation by increasing fatty acid oxidation via PKA activation, which may play an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis in insulin-resistant obese diabetic patients.

Recently, the leptin receptor has been identified on endothelial cells, and leptin has been shown to promote both angiogenesis and inflammation (8Sierra-Honigmann M.R. Nath A.K. Murakami C.

However, the mechanism by which leptin induces inflammation remains to be elucidated. Adipocytes have recently been shown to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 (10Hotamisligil G.S. Arner P. Caro J.F. Atkinson R.L. Spiegelman B.M. J.

We have very recently shown that hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) serves as a causal link between elevated glucose and hyperglycemic vascular damage (15Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.P. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nature. 2000; 404: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the direct effects of leptin on ROS generation, and the mechanism by which this induced expression of the redox-sensitive chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (16Wung B.S.

ROS production was determined from an H2O2 standard curve (10–200 μm). Cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml leptin for 45 min in medium containing 5 mm glucose. Then cells were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 1 ml of PBS containing 1 μCi 2-deoxy-d-[1-3H]glucose for 5 min. Cells were solubilized in 1 ml of 1 N NaOH for 60 min at 37 °C, and the radioactivity was counted as described previously (17Kaiser N. Sasson S. Feener E.P. Boukobza-Vardi N. Higashi S. Moller D.E.

Tanaka K. Kaneda Y. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), using 9.75 mg of the dried lipids and 200 μg of plasmid DNA. Cells were preincubated with or without TDGA, a specific irreversible inhibitor of CPT-1, for 45 min (20Guzmán M. Geelen M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Then the medium was aspirated, and cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells were then treated with either genistein or H-89. After 45 min, cells were incubated with or without 10 ng/ml leptin and were subsequently permeabilized with 700 μl of a medium containing 50 mm imidazole (pH 7.1), 70 mm KCl, 80 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 1 mmKCN, 1 mm ATP, and 0.1% (w/vol) defatted and dialyzed bovine serum albumin (medium A), supplemented with 100 μl of 0.2 mg/ml digitonin. The medium was aspirated after 3 min, and reactions were started by addition of 700 μl of medium A supplemented with 100 μl of 0.4 mm palmitoyl-CoA plus 1.2 mml-[methyl-3H]carnitine. After 4-min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped with 0.8 ml of 2 n HCl, and [3H]palmitoylcarnitine product was extracted with n-butanol (21Blazquez C. Sanchezm C. Velascom G. Guzmán M.

ACC activity was determined in digitonin-permeabilized BAEC as the incorporation of radiolabeled acetyl-CoA into fatty acids in a reaction coupled to the fatty acid synthase reaction. Cells were pretreated with or without either genistein or H-89 for 45 min and then treated with or without 10 ng/ml leptin. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then trypsinized.

After 5-min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped with 100 μl of 10n NaOH, and fatty acids were extracted by petroleum ether (22Bijleveld C. Geelen M.J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 918: 273-283Google Scholar). Cells were cultured with or without 10 ng/ml leptin in the presence or absence of genistein, H-89, Rp-cAMPS, or TDGA for 24 h. MCP-1 content in the medium was analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit derived from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were incubated with or without 10 ng/ml leptin for 45 min, lysed, and PKA activity was measured using a commerical protein kinase A assay kit (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated with or without 10 ng/ml leptin, lysed, and cAMP concentrations in whole-cell lysates were determined using the cyclic Amp (3H) assay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data were analyzed using the one-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedure to compare the means of all the groups. The Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons procedure was used to determine which pairs of means were different. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. To determine the site of leptin-induced intracellular ROS production, BAEC were incubated with either rotenone, an inhibitor of complex I, TTFA, an inhibitor of complex II, or CCCP, an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation that abolishes the mitochondrial membrane proton gradient, MnTBAP, a stable cell-permeable SOD mimetic, UCP-1 HVJ-liposomes, or MnSOD HVJ-liposomes. Compared with basal conditions (5 mm glucose), 10 ng/ml leptin increased ROS production to about 2.3-fold (Fig. 1). Furthermore, all the reagents were found to completely prevent the effects of leptin on ROS production in BAEC, demonstrating that ROS generation arises from mitochondrial electron transport chain. We have very recently shown that hyperglycemia-induced ROS generation also arises exclusively from the mitochondrial electron transport chain (15Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.P. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nature. 2000; 404: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next investigated the additive effects of high glucose and leptin on ROS production in BAEC. As shown in Fig.2, leptin increased ROS production in a dose-dependent manner at every concentrations of glucose tested, and the effect was synergistic with that of glucose at the highest leptin concentration. The effects of leptin on glucose transport activity of BAEC was assayed with a glucose analogue, 2-DG, in confluent cultures preexposed to 10 ng/ml leptin for 45 min. Leptin did not affect the uptake of 2-DG into BAEC (leptin-treated versus control cells; 7.29 ± 0.2 versus 7.18 ± 0.34 μmol/mg/min). Intracellular glucose oxidation begins with glycolysis in the cytoplasm, leading to the generation of pyruvate, which can also be transported into the mitochondria where it is oxidized by the TCA cycle. Therefore, we next investigated the effects of leptin on glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Ten ng/ml leptin affected neither glycolysis nor the TCA cycle in BAEC (glycolysis and TCA cycle of leptin-treated versus control cells; 1.39 ± 0.36versus 1.73 ± 0.16 nmol/mg/min and 0.131 ± 0.003versus 0.123 ± 0.009 nmol/mg/min, respectively). These results suggest that neither glycolysis nor the TCA cycle is the source of increased ROS generation induced by leptin. We next investigated the effects of leptin on fatty acid oxidation in BAEC. For this, BAEC were incubated with [14C]palmitate in the presence or absence of leptin and then 14CO2production was determined. Compared with basal conditions (5 mm glucose), 10 ng/ml leptin increased fatty acid oxidation about 1.5-fold (Fig. 3). Furthermore, high glucose was found not to inhibit the leptin-induced increase in fatty acid oxidation in BAEC. These results suggest that leptin produces ROS generation through an increase of fatty acid oxidation that is independent of glucose concentrations. CPT-1, located in the mitochondrial outer membrane, catalyzes the pace-setting step of long chain fatty acid translocation into the mitochondrial matrix, and is a key regulatory site of fatty acid oxidation. We investigated the effects of leptin on CPT-1 activity in BAEC. As shown in Fig. 4, leptin increased CPT-1 activity about 1.7-fold. Genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases and H-89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), completely prevented the leptin-induced increase in CPT-1 activity in BAEC. Because CPT-1 is subject to inhibition by malonyl-CoA, the product of the reaction catalyzed by ACC, a key regulatory enzyme of fatty acid synthesis, we next studied the effects of leptin on ACC activity in BAEC. In contrast to the case of CPT-1, leptin was found to decrease ACC activity to about 50% of that of control cells (Fig.5). Genistein or H-89 completely prevented the leptin-induced decrease in ACC activity in BAEC. Rp-cAMPS treatment similarly inhibited the leptin-induced increase in CPT-1 and the decrease in ACC activity (data not shown). These results suggest that activation of the leptin receptor tyrosine kinase increases fatty acid oxidation by increasing CPT-1 activity and decreasing ACC activity via PKA activation. We next investigated whether the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation induced by leptin could block leptin-induced ROS generation in BAEC. As shown in Fig. 6, genistein, H-89, Rp-cAMPS, or TDGA completely inhibited the production of ROS induced by leptin. The results indicate that leptin-induced ROS production is derived from PKA-induced fatty acid oxidation. Because MCP-1 production is known to be induced by ROS (14Panahloo A. Yudkin J.S. Coron. Artery Dis. 1996; 7: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we studied whether leptin can stimulate the production of MCP-1 in BAEC. As shown in Fig.7, compared with basal conditions (5 mm glucose), 10 ng/ml leptin increases the MCP-1 production about 1.4-fold. Genistein, H-89, Rp-cAMPS, or TDGA was found to completely inhibit the leptin-induced MCP-1 production in BAEC. The results suggest that the leptin-induced ROS production enhances the production of MCP-1 in BAEC by increasing fatty acid oxidation via PKA activation. Because both H89 and Rp-cAMPS blocked the effects of leptin on ROS and MCP-1 production, PKA activity was directly measured in the presence and absence of 10 ng/ml leptin. Leptin induced a 2-fold increase in PKA activity compared with controls (56.0 ± 7.8 versus 27.2 ± 1.6 pmol/min/mg protein). To confirm that leptin induced cAMP, levels were determined after leptin stimulation. Leptin induced a 1.3-fold increase in cAMP in total cell lysate (13.28 ± 1.08 versus 10.33 ± 1.25 pmol/mg protein, p < 0.03). In this study, we found for the first time that leptin induces mitochondrial superoxide production and MCP-1 expression in BAEC by increasing fatty acid oxidation via PKA. Like the AMP-activated protein kinase, PKA may stimulate CPT-1, a key enzyme of fatty acid oxidation, by two mechanisms: one is by decreasing malonyl-CoA levels through phosphorylation and inactivation of ACC, and the other is by modulating the interactions between CPT-1 and the cytoskeleton through phosphorylation of intermediate filaments in a malonyl-CoA-independent manner (23Velasco G. Geelen M.J.H. Gomez del Pulgar T. Guzmán M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21497-21504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Guzmán M. Velasco G. Geelen M.J.H. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 49-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that PKA activation is a key step for the leptin-induced ROS generation in BAEC. According to the glucose fatty acid cycle hypothesis of Randle (25Randle P.J. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 263-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), glucose oxidation inhibits fatty acid oxidation. However, we did not observe this effect in our system. This likely reflects the fact that PKA and AMP-activated kinase may inhibit ACC activation by citrate derived from glucose oxidation and thus prevent the malonyl-CoA inhibition of CPT-1, which is the basis for Randle cycle (25Randle P.J. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 263-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 26Ruderman N.B. Saha A.K. Vavvas D. Witters L.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E1-E18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the additive effects of leptin-induced fatty acid oxidation and glucose most likely reflect the fact that hyperglycemia enhances ROS formation through increased pyruvate oxidation in the TCA cycle (15Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.P. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nature. 2000; 404: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar), whereas leptin enhances ROS formation through increased beta oxidation and oxidation of the resultant acetyl-CoA through the TCA cycle. Plasma levels of leptin in healthy subjects are less than 10 ng/ml. In obese subjects and insulin resistant first-degree relatives of patients with NIDDM, they are increased to 10–100 ng/ml, and similar values have been reported in type I diabetes (3Nyholm B. Fisker S. Lund S. Moller N. Schmitz O. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Rudberg S. Persson B. Horm.

Med. 1995; 1: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (3337) Google Scholar). In this study, 10 ng/ml leptin was sufficient to nearly triple fatty acid-induced mitochondrial overproduction of ROS. The effect of 10 and 100 ng/ml leptin was further accentuated by diabetic levels of hyperglycemia. These data suggest that hyperleptinemia accelerates atherosclerosis in obese diabetic patients through ROS overproduction. In insulin resistant states, the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase in adipose tissues is known to be increased, contributing to the elevation of free fatty acids (27Stralfors P. Bjorgell P. Belfrage P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore, the coexistence of hyperleptinemia and insulin resistance-induced elevation of free fatty acids may further enhance the ROS generation in vascular endothelial cells, promoting atherosclerosis. ROS is recently reported to up-regulate many genes that are involved in various steps of atherosclerosis by inducing redox-sensitive transcriptional factors such as nuclear factor-κB and activator protein-1 (28Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10004) Google Scholar, 29Abe J. Berk B.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 30Marui N.

Among these mediators, MCP-1, a CC chemokine, plays an important role in the early phase of atherosclerosis by initiating monocyte/macrophage recruitment to the vessel wall (31Rollins B.J. Yoshimura T. Leonard E.J. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 1229-1233PubMed Google Scholar), and its expression is actually known to be up-regulated in human atherosclerotic plaques (32Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. Gordon D. Wilcox J.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the selective targeting of CCR2, the receptor for MCP-1, was recently shown to markedly decrease atheromataous lesion formation in apoE knockout mice (33Boring L. Gosling J. Cleary M. Charo I.F. Nature. 1998; 394: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). Therefore, MCP-1 overproduction induced by leptin would promote fatty streak formation, the earliest histopathological hallmark of atherosclerosis. The elimination of ROS generation induced by leptin via fatty acid oxidation may provide a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetic patients."

Cell. 1996; 85: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In the actin-based motility of Vaccinia virus, Nck coordinates the assembly of an actin nucleation complex at the viral surface by binding to a tyrosine-phosphorylated viral protein through its SH2 domain and by recruiting neural Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) through its SH3 domains (11Frischknecht F. Moreau V. Rottger S. Gonfloni S. Reckmann I. Superti-Furga G. Way M. Nature. 1999; 401: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that N-WASP, when coordinately activated by Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), can stimulate actin nucleation through the Arp2/3 complex (12Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Because Vaccinia motility is independent of Cdc42, an unanswered question is how this phosphotyrosine-Nck pathway activates N-WASP. In this study, we demonstrate that Nck can fully activate N-WASP in cooperation with PIP2 (but not Cdc42). Maximal activity requires all three SH3 domains of Nck. These results suggest the presence of a phosphotyrosine-Nck/PIP2 pathway that is distinct from the previously described Cdc42/PIP2 pathway and provide support for the principle that WASP family proteins can integrate multiple upstream signals. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusions of human Nck1 and the various Nck fragments shown in Fig. 4 A were expressed inEscherichia coli and affinity purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads according to established protocols. For particular experiments, GST was cleaved from Nck using the PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Purification of untagged full-length rat N-WASP and hexahistidine-tagged WGP and WG fragments produced in Sf9 cells, GST-VCA produced in E. coli, and the Arp2/3 complex purified from bovine brain extracts has been described previously (12Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 13Rohatgi R. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The pyrene actin assays used to monitor actin polymerization in the presence of various components, as well as the methods used for data analysis, have been described in detail previously (13Rohatgi R. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). All polymerization reactions contained 1.0 µm unlabeled actin, 0.3 µm pyrene-actin (50% labeled), 0.2 mm ATP, 30 nm Arp2/3, 100 nm N-WASP, and various proteins at the indicated concentrations in 80 µl of XB buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA). Because the activation of the Arp2/3 complex by N-WASP accelerates the kinetics of polymerization by catalyzing nucleation, the maximum slope of these polymerization curves is an indicator of the extent of N-WASP activation by added components. The Nck far-Western assays were performed with GST fusions labeled with glutathione-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (GSH-HRP; Sigma). Recombinant proteins (N-WASP, WGP, WG, or VCA) were separated on 12% or 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF membranes, and blocked with 10% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween (150 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris 8.0, 0.05% Tween 20) at 4 °C overnight. GST fusions of Nck fragments, which served as probes in the binding assay, were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with GSH-HRP (1 µg of SH3 domain + 0.2 µg of GSH-HRP). The PVDF strips with immobilized N-WASP mutants were incubated with the different GSH-HRP-loaded SH3 domains at 4 °C for 1 h at a final concentration of 1 µg of SH3 domain/ml in Tris-buffered saline with Tween. Strips were washed at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline with Tween three times for 10 min each, and the bound probe was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. For solution binding assays, 293T cells were transfected with plasmid expressing rat N-WASP tagged at the N terminus with six tandem copies of the Myc epitope, and lysed 2 days post-transfection in TXB (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Equal amounts of lysate were incubated at 4 °C with 10 µl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prebound to 5 µg of GST or the molar equivalent of GST-Nck fusion proteins. After 1 h the beads were washed 3 times in lysis buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, split into two aliquots, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on duplicate 10% gels. One gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the other was transferred to PVDF membrane and immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Given the published observation that Nck can physically associate with WASP (and likely N-WASP) through its SH3 domains, we used an established pyrene-actin assay system to test whether recombinant GST-Nck could stimulate the ability of N-WASP to activate the Arp2/3 complex (3Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Marcilla A. Sameshima J.H. Robbins K.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5725-5731Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 14Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). GST-Nck alone could activate N-WASP in a dose-dependent, saturable fashion (Fig.1). The concentration of GST-Nck required for half-maximal activation (Kact or potency) was ∼80 nm, and the maximum polymerization rate (Pmaxor efficacy) at saturating concentrations of GST-Nck was ∼4-fold higher than that for the unactivated reaction. The SH3-SH2-SH3 adapter protein Grb2 has also been shown to activate N-WASP with a similar Kact (100–200 nm) (15Carlier M.F. Nioche P. Broutin-L'Hermite I. Boujemaa R. Le Clainche C. Egile C. Garbay C. Ducruix A. Sansonetti P.J. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21969-21974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the presence of 10 µm PIP2-containing vesicles, which have minimal effects on N-WASP activity on their own, the Pmaxfor GST-Nck increased dramatically to over 30-fold above the unactivated reaction whereas the Kact stayed at ∼80 nm (Fig. 1). Thus, Nck and PIP2 vesicles can synergistically activate N-WASP in a manner similar to that previously demonstrated for Cdc42 and PIP2 (12Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). The requirement for two signals for N-WASP activation reinforces the emerging principle that WASP family proteins sit at integration points in signaling networks (13Rohatgi R. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that activation of N-WASP by Nck is not dependent on GST, because GST-fused or -cleaved versions of Nck (and the Nck mutants described later) do not significantly differ in activity (data not shown). Because the Grb2 adaptor had been previously reported to stimulate N-WASP-mediated actin polymerization (15Carlier M.F. Nioche P. Broutin-L'Hermite I. Boujemaa R. Le Clainche C. Egile C. Garbay C. Ducruix A. Sansonetti P.J. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21969-21974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we compared the efficacy of Nck and Grb2 in activating N-WASP. GST-Grb2 had only a slight effect on actin polymerization under these conditions, even when present at very high levels (500 µm), and the combination of GST-Grb2 and PIP2-containing vesicles resulted in only a modest further stimulation, significantly lower than that seen with the combination of GST-Nck and PIP2 (Fig.2 A). We also tested whether Nck and Grb2 had could synergistically activate N-WASP. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the combination of GST-Nck and GST-Grb2 was actually less effective than GST-Nck alone, consistent with competition between Nck and Grb2 for binding to the same sites on N-WASP. Taken together our results suggest that Nck is a more potent activator of N-WASP than is Grb2 and that their modes of activation are qualitatively similar. Because Cdc42 and SH3 domains likely bind to different sites on the N-WASP molecule, it has been proposed that these two classes of activators may also act synergistically (16Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). In fact, Grb2 and Cdc42 appear to have at least additive effects on the activity of N-WASP (15Carlier M.F. Nioche P. Broutin-L'Hermite I. Boujemaa R. Le Clainche C. Egile C. Garbay C. Ducruix A. Sansonetti P.J. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21969-21974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, we did not find evidence for synergy between Cdc42 and Nck in the activation of N-WASP (Fig. 3). In both the presence and absence of PIP2 vesicles, the effects of Nck and Cdc42 together were significantly less than additive, indicating that they are functionally redundant. Despite this apparent redundancy, the fact that Cdc42 and Nck bind to different sites on N-WASP indicates that the specific mechanism by which they activate the molecule (that is, stabilize the active conformation of N-WASP relative to the inactive one) must be different. In addition, the functional redundancy of Cdc42 and Nck supports the notion that the Nck pathway is an independent signaling mechanism for the control of actin nucleation through the N-WASP-Arp2/3 module. This N-WASP-Arp2/3 module requires at least two inputs for maximal activation, a property that can allow it to amplify spatially and temporally coincident signals (17Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Dyche Mullins R. Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In this regard, it will be interesting to examine the effects of SH3 domain proteins such as Grb2 and Nck on the activity of the related WASP molecule, which differs from N-WASP in requiring only one input (PIP2) for high levels of activity (18Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). To map the interaction between Nck and N-WASP in more detail, we investigated the abilities of several fragments of Nck to activate N-WASP in the presence of PIP2 vesicles. The three SH3 domains of Nck are named 1, 2, and 3 moving from the N to the C terminus, and the nomenclature of the fragments is summarized in Fig.4 A. The SH2 domain of Nck is dispensable for the interaction with N-WASP, because GST-Nck displayed approximately the same Kact and Pmax as a C-terminal truncation mutant carrying only the three SH3 domains (GST-SH3(1+2+3)) (Fig. 4 B). To identify the specific SH3 domain(s) required for activation, we tested protein fragments containing SH3 domains 1 and 2 (GST-SH3(1+2)), SH3 domains 2 and 3 (GST-SH3(2+3)), or each individual SH3 domain (GST-SH3(1), GST-SH3(2), and GST-SH3(3)). GST-SH3(1+2) activated N-WASP with an ∼7-fold higher Kact and a 2-fold lower Pmax than GST-SH3(1+2+3) (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, GST-SH3(2+3) did not significantly activate N-WASP until very high concentrations (∼3–10 µm) were added (Fig. 4 B). None of the SH3 domains of Nck were capable of activating N-WASP when tested individually (Fig. 4 C). Based on this domain analysis, optimal activation of N-WASP requires the presence of all three SH3 domains of Nck, consistent with the model in which multiple specific SH3 interactions are required to fix N-WASP in the activated conformation. This is quite distinct from the mode of interaction between Grb2 and N-WASP, where a single C-terminal SH3 domain from Grb2 is sufficient to achieve activation (15Carlier M.F. Nioche P. Broutin-L'Hermite I. Boujemaa R. Le Clainche C. Egile C. Garbay C. Ducruix A. Sansonetti P.J. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21969-21974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To examine the correlation between activation potency and binding affinity, we also mapped the physical interaction between N-WASP and Nck. Using a far-Western assay, several N-WASP truncation mutants (Fig.5 A) were tested for their abilities to bind to the GST-SH3 (1+2+3) fragment of Nck, which fully activated N-WASP in the pyrene-actin assay. Full-length N-WASP and the WGP fragment (containing the WH1,G-protein-binding, and Poly-proline domains) bound to Nck, but the two fragments lacking the polyproline region (WG and VCA) did not (Fig. 5 B). As expected, the polyproline region of N-WASP is required for the interaction with Nck. Next, the Nck truncation mutants shown in Fig.4 A were used to identify the SH3 domain(s) required for the interaction with N-WASP (Fig. 5 C). The rank order of binding affinities for the Nck fragments is as follows: SH3(1+2+3) ≥ SH3(2+3) > SH3(1+2) > SH3(2) > SH3(3) > SH3 (1Galisteo M.L. Chernoff J. Su Y.C. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20997-21000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 C). A similar rank order of binding (SH3(1+2+3) = SH3(2+3) > SH3(1+2) = SH3(2) > SH3(3) > SH3 (1Galisteo M.L. Chernoff J. Su Y.C. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20997-21000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar)) was observed when the Nck fragments were tested for their ability to pull down tagged N-WASP from lysates of transfected 293T cells (Fig.5 D), demonstrating that the far-Western assay accurately reflects the interaction between the proteins in solution. Based on these results, we conclude that multiple SH3 domains are required for the optimal interaction between Nck and N-WASP, with the second SH3 domain displaying the highest affinity for N-WASP. Although a previous report suggested that the third SH3 domain of Nck binds most tightly to WASP (3Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Marcilla A. Sameshima J.H. Robbins K.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5725-5731Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), we have found that although SH3–3 is indeed essential for optimal binding, SH3–2 binds more tightly than SH3–3 to both N-WASP and WASP (Fig. 5, and data not shown). A surprising conclusion of our binding and activation data is that the sequence requirements for activation are more stringent than those for binding. For instance, although GST-SH3(2+3) binds quite tightly to N-WASP, it shows almost no ability to activate N-WASP. Instead, GST-SH3(1+2), which binds less tightly, can activate N-WASP to a moderate degree, and GST-SH3(1+2+3), which binds with about equal affinity, can fully activate N-WASP. This suggests that Nck activates N-WASP through multiple cooperative interactions, some of which contribute energy to binding (SH3(2+3)) and others that contribute energy to activation (SH3(1+2)). It is important to note that the total number of SH3 domains (independent of identity) is not the determinant of activity. Wild-type Nck cleaved from GST, with three SH3 domains, can fully activate N-WASP whereas GST-SH3(2+3), with four SH3 domains due to the dimerization of GST, cannot activate N-WASP (Fig. 3 and Fig.4 B, and data not shown). Studies of Vaccinia in tissue culture cells have suggested that Nck recruits N-WASP indirectly to the viral surface through WIP (19Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Vincentelli R. Rabut G. Stewart D. Way M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Our results show that Nck can also directly interact with N-WASP and dramatically influence its ability to nucleate actin assembly. Thus, recruitment and activation of N-WASP may be controlled by distinct mechanisms, perhaps providing tighter multilevel control over the signaling pathway. Consistent with this idea, we have found that the addition of WIP has no effect on the ability of Nck and PIP2 to activate N-WASP (data not shown). This negative result also shows that WIP (which has been shown to bind to the second SH3 domain of Nck, as well as the WASP homology domain 1 of WASP and N-WASP (4Anton I.M. Lu W.G. Mayer B.J. Ramesh N. Geha R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20992-20995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)) does not interfere with the interaction between Nck and N-WASP. Another interesting question is how the interaction between N-WASP and Nck is regulated in cells. The SH3 domains of Nck have been shown to bind to several important signaling proteins that regulate the cytoskeleton, such as p21-activated kinase, Abl, and Cbl (1Galisteo M.L. Chernoff J. Su Y.C.

These proteins may regulate the Nck-N-WASP interaction by competing with N-WASP for binding to Nck or by the covalent modification of members of an actin nucleation complex containing Nck. In fact, phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine residue in the regulatory domain of N-WASP has been predicted to stabilize the activated state (16Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The presence or absence of these other proteins in complexes that assemble at the cell surface would modulate whether N-WASP is recruited and activated. The interaction of Nck with tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors would also serve to bring N-WASP into proximity with PIP2 at the membrane surface. In addition to studies with Vaccinia virus, PIP2and phosphotyrosine signals have been implicated in actin assembly stimulated by cytoplasmic vesicles rich in sphingolipid-cholesterol membrane microdomains or “rafts” (22Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). These rafts have been shown to stimulate actin assembly through the WASP-Arp2/3 pathway. Our results provide a plausible mechanism by which the phosphotyrosine and PIP2 signals could be integrated by N-WASP through an adapter protein like Nck. Nck has also been implicated in the regulation of membrane ruffling downstream of the PDGF-R in NIH 3T3 cells (23Chen M. She H. Kim A. Woodley D.T. Li W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7867-7880Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this pathway is dependent on Rac, which controls ruffling and lamellipodia formation, but not on Cdc42, which controls filopodia formation (24Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 25Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar, 26Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar). Thus, the Nck pathway may serve as a general Cdc42-independent link between phosphotyrosine signals and the actin cytoskeleton.

https://openalex.org/W2105904890,"Glial cells express a variety of neurotransmitter receptors. Notably, Bergmann glial cells in the cerebellum have Ca 2+ -permeable α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)–type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) assembled without the GluR2 subunit. To elucidate the role of these Ca 2+ -permeable AMPARs, we converted them into Ca 2+ -impermeable receptors by adenoviral-mediated delivery of the GluR2 gene. This conversion retracted the glial processes ensheathing synapses on Purkinje cell dendritic spines and retarded the removal of synaptically released glutamate. Furthermore, it caused multiple innervation of Purkinje cells by the climbing fibers. Thus, the glial Ca 2+ -permeable AMPARs are indispensable for proper structural and functional relations between Bergmann glia and glutamatergic synapses."

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Aβ has been shown to form amyloid fibrils, but this requires concentrations of Aβ (>10−4to 10−5m) (2Hilbich C.

Therefore, it has been hypothesized that aggregation of soluble Aβin vivo involves seeded polymerization (5Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev.

Interestingly, however, GM1/Aβ is never found in the normal brain despite the fact that neuronal membranes are abundant in GM1 and physiological metabolism of amyloid precursor protein results in extracellular secretion of Aβ. Thus, identification of factors that initiate formation of GM1/Aβ may be crucial for determination of the pathogenesis of AD and for development of preventive and curative treatment strategies. We have recently found that alterations in lipid composition of the host membrane can be such a factor (13Matsuzaki K. Horikiri C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar); generation of GM1/Aβ is facilitated by the combination of cholesterol and sphingomyelin (SM) in membranes in proportions similar to the so-called detergent-insoluble glycolipid-rich domain (DIG) (15Brown R.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that DIG is deeply involved in GM1/Aβ formation. This hypothesis is in agreement with the observation that Aβ is present in DIG in vivo (16Lee S.-J. Liyanage U. Bickel P.E. Xia W. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Kosik K.S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 17Morishima-Kawashima M. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15235-15247Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this study, the effects of GM1 and cholesterol contents in the membranes on the binding of Aβ to DIG-like lipid bilayers were examined in detail using fluorescent dye-labeled human Aβ-(1–40). We report here that enrichment of cholesterol of the host membranes facilitated the generation of GM1/Aβ via formation of a GM1 “cluster” that acts as a binding site of Aβ. A plausible mechanism of onset of AD will be discussed. Human Aβ-(1–40) labeled with the 7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carbonyl group at its N terminus (DAC-Aβ, Fig. 1) was custom synthesized by the Peptide Institute (Minou, Japan). The peptide was characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy (calculated, 4574.07; found, 4574.0) as well as amino acid analysis under two different hydrolysis conditions. The dye-labeled peptide was always handled in light-protected, capped tubes under a nitrogen atmosphere to avoid photodegradation. Unlabeled human Aβ-(1–40) was also purchased from the Peptide Institute. The latter peptide was first dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (Wako, Osaka, Japan) to avoid self-aggregation. After removal of the solvent by nitrogen purging, the peptide was redissolved in pure water (Nanopure) at 30 μm and then mixed with an equal volume of double concentrated buffer (20 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The labeled peptide was found to be less stable in this organic solvent and therefore was directly dissolved in pure water. Physiological Aβ is present in a soluble form. To mimic this situation, we removed aggregates, if any, by ultracentrifugation in 500-μl polyallomer tubes at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C for 1 h. Indeed, the supernatant used adopted unordered structures (see Fig. 6) and did not react with thioflavin T (data not shown), which has been widely used for the detection of amyloid aggregation (18LeVine III, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). The aggregational state of the peptide was further characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using precast 15% polyacrylamide gel SPU-15S (Atto, Tokyo). Only a band corresponding to monomer was detected by silver staining (data not shown). The peptide concentration of the supernatant was determined in triplicate by Micro BCA protein assay (Pierce).Figure 6Secondary structures of native human Aβ-(1–40). CD spectra of the peptide (15 μm) were recorded in the absence and presence of GM1/cholesterol/SM (40:30:30) SUVs at 30 °C. GM1/Aβ ratio was as follows: 0 (trace 1), 10 (trace 2); 20 (trace 3); 40 (trace 4); 80 (trace 5). The spectra are the averages for two preparations, and the S.E. values were within 700 degrees cm2 dmol−1 at 220 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) GM1 and cholesterol were purchased from Sigma. Porcine brain l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine (PS) and egg yolk-l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Bovine brain SM was obtained from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). The molar lipid compositions of the DIG-like membranes used were GM1/cholesterol/SM (40:30:30), GM1/cholesterol/SM (40:12:48), GM1/cholesterol/SM (20:40:40), and GM1/cholesterol/SM (20:16:64), which are referred to as GM1-rich cholesterol-rich, GM1-rich cholesterol-poor, GM1-poor cholesterol-rich, and GM1-poor cholesterol-poor, respectively. The GM1-rich and GM1-poor systems had GM1 contents of 40 and 20%, respectively. The cholesterol/SM ratios of the cholesterol-rich and cholesterol-poor systems were 1 and 0.25, respectively. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) for fluorescence experiments were prepared and characterized as described elsewhere (19Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Tokuda H. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3342-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids were mixed in a chloroform/methanol mixture. The solvent was removed by evaporation in a rotary evaporator. The residual lipid film, after drying under vacuum overnight, was hydrated with buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) and vortex-mixed to produce multilamellar vesicles. A physiological concentration of Ca2+ was included because this divalent ion is known to interact with gangliosides (20McDaniel R. McLaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 819: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For PS LUV preparation, CaCl2, which induces aggregation and fusion of vesicles, was omitted, and 1 mm EDTA was added. The suspension was subjected to five cycles of freezing and thawing and then extruded through polycarbonate filters (100-nm pore size filter, 31 times) using a Liposofast extruder (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada). The lipid concentration was determined in triplicate by phosphorus analysis (21Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Small unilamellar vesicles for CD experiments were prepared by sonication of multilamellar vesicles under a nitrogen atmosphere for 15 min (three times for 5 min each) using a probe-type sonicator. Metal debris from the titanium tip of the probe was removed by centrifugation. Fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Shimadzu RF-5000 or RF-5300 spectrofluorometer with a cuvette holder thermostatted at 30 °C. After blank subtraction (and volume correction in titration experiments), the spectra were corrected using the spectrum correction attachment provided by the manufacturer. DAC-Aβ solution (1 μm, 2 ml) was titrated with aliquots of a concentrated LUV suspension in a quartz cuvette with gentle stirring. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at an excitation wavelength of 430 nm. The titration interval was 3 min, which was confirmed to be sufficient for the establishment of binding equilibrium. For competitive binding experiments, GM1-rich cholesterol-rich LUVs (20 μm) were mixed with a DAC-Aβ solution (0.16 μm). Under this condition, the binding sites were almost saturated with DAC-Aβ. The mixture (2 ml) was titrated with aliquots of an unlabeled Aβ-(1–40) solution (280 μm, monomeric confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), which was prepared by dissolving the peptide in 0.02% ammonia on ice followed by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 3 h, 4 °C) (22Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Omata S. Gejyo F. Naiki H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15514-15521Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity at 470 nm (excitation at 430 nm) was monitored during titration. Five minutes were required to establish equilibrium. LUVs containing 5 or 10 mol % BODIPY-GM1 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were placed in a quartz cuvette. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm. Fluorescence anisotropy (r) was determined at an emission wavelength of 520 nm (monomer peak) using polarizers placed in both the excitation and emission light paths (23Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Orenum Press, New York1983: 112-155Google Scholar). r=(I0–0−GI0–90)/(I0–0+2GI0–90)Equation 1 G=I90–0/I90–90Equation 2 Fluorescence intensity was denoted by I, and the suffixes indicate polarization (in degrees) of the excitation-emission beams. Fluorescence intensity of the corresponding blank sample without BODIPY-GM1 was negligible. Native human Aβ-(1–40) (15 μm) in buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) was used for CD measurements. CD spectra were measured on a Jasco J-720 apparatus interfaced to an NEC PC9801 microcomputer, using a 1-mm path length quartz cell to minimize the absorbance due to buffer components. The instrumental outputs were calibrated with nonhygroscopic ammoniumd-camphor-10-sulfonate (24Takakuwa T. Konno T. Meguro H. Anal. Sci. 1985; 1: 215-218Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Eight scans were averaged for each sample. The averaged blank spectra (vesicle suspension or buffer) were subtracted. Binding of DAC-Aβ to LUVs of various lipid compositions was estimated on the basis of DAC fluorescence. The fluorophore was practically nonfluorescent in aqueous environments (Fig. 2 A,trace 1). The addition of GM1-rich cholesterol-rich LUVs at a lipid/peptide ratio (L/P) of 80 induced a large increase in fluorescence intensity accompanied by a blue shift in the emission maximum from 483 to 470 nm, indicating that the peptide was bound to the membrane with the N-terminal DAC moiety embedded in a hydrophobic environment. Fluorescence spectra of DAC-Aβ were also measured in various dioxane/water mixtures. The maximal wavelength of 470 nm in the presence of the membrane corresponded to that in a dioxane/water (3/1, v/v) mixture with a dielectric constant of ∼20, suggesting that the DAC moiety was located at the interfacial region of the membrane (25White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). To confirm that DAC-Aβ behaves similarly to native Aβ, competitive binding experiments were carried out. The binding sites of GM1-rich cholesterol-rich LUVs were almost saturated with DAC-Aβ. Unlabeled Aβ was then added, and a decrease in fluorescence was monitored as a function of unlabeled Aβ-to-DAC-Aβ ratio (Fig. 2 B,closed circles). About 40-fold unlabeled peptide was needed to replace 50% of the labeled peptide. Conversely, the pretreatment of the vesicles with excess unlabeled peptide decreased DAC-Aβ binding (Fig. 2 B, open circle). These data suggest that both peptides competitively and reversibly bind to the common binding site with DAC-Aβ having a 40-fold larger affinity. Thus, DAC fluorescence can be utilized to assess the binding affinity of Aβ for various membranes. As a quantitative measure, relative fluorescence enhancement (R) is defined as follows. R=(F−F0)/F0Equation 3 Fluorescence intensities at 466 nm (peak of raw, uncorrected spectra) in the presence and absence of LUVs are denoted byF and F 0, respectively. Fig.3 plots the R value as a function of L/P for various lipids. DAC-Aβ exhibited strong binding only to GM1-containing membranes (open circles). The R value was almost saturated; i.e. the peptide was completely bound at an L/P of >200. Negatively charged PS (open diamonds), zwitterionic PC (open squares), or PC/cholesterol (2:1) (closed squares) bilayers did not bind the amyloid even at the highest L/P ratio examined (2560). The effects of lipid composition on peptide binding to GM1-containing DIG-mimicking membranes were examined in detail. Fig.4 A shows the Rvalue as a function of GM1/DAC-Aβ ratio instead of L/P, because GM1 seems to constitute a “binding site” for the peptide. The binding was strongly dependent on GM1 as well as cholesterol contents. For the cholesterol-rich systems, a decrease in GM1 content from 40 to 20% significantly reduced DAC-Aβ binding (Fig. 4, open circles versus open triangles). Surprisingly, in the case of the GM1-poor systems, a decrease in the cholesterol/SM ratio from 1 to 0.25 markedly reduced DAC-Aβ binding (Fig. 4, open versus closed triangles). Binding isotherms were obtained from Fig. 4 A as follows.R max values were estimated by linear extrapolation of R versus DAC-Aβ/GM1 plots (DAC-Aβ/GM1 → 0) and are summarized in TableI. In the case of the GM1-poor cholesterol-poor bilayers, the R max value was assumed to be the same as that of the GM1-poor cholesterol-rich system because data close to saturation could not be obtained (Fig.4 A). This assumption was reasonable because theR max values for the other systems were similar. The R/R max ratio gives the bound fraction of the peptide at each data point. Fig. 4 B shows binding isotherms, i.e. bound DAC-Aβ per exofacial GM1 (x) versus free DAC-Aβ concentration (c f ) plots. GM1 molecules on the outer leaflets (50% of total GM1) were assumed to be available for DAC-Aβ binding. The two isotherms of the GM1-rich systems were sigmoidal, implying cooperative binding. Therefore, the curves were analyzed by Equation 4(Fowler's equation) instead of the conventional Langmuir equation (26Cerny S. King D.A. Woodruff D.P. The Chemical Physics of Soild Surfaces and Heterogeneous Catalysis. 2. Elsevier, Amsterdam1983: 1-57Google Scholar). θ=x/xmax=(Kexp(αθ)cf)/(1+Kexp(αθ)cf)Equation 4 The maximal x values, x max, were estimated by linear extrapolation of x versus1/c f plots (1/c f → 0). The binding constant and lateral interaction parameter are denoted byK (m−1) and α, respectively. The binding isotherms at the lower GM1 content could be well explained by the Langmuir equation (i.e. α = 0 in Equation 4). The obtained binding parameters are summarized in Table I. Interestingly, the binding affinities (K) were very similar (2–3 × 106m−1), whereas the binding capacities (x max) were highly dependent on GM1 as well as cholesterol contents.Table IParameters for binding of DAC-Aβ to GM1-containing membranesSystemLipid compositionR maxK (106 ×m−1)1-aBinding parameters from Equation 4 are the means ± S.D. obtained on 2–4 independent measurements.α1-aBinding parameters from Equation 4 are the means ± S.D. obtained on 2–4 independent measurements.x max1-aBinding parameters from Equation 4 are the means ± S.D. obtained on 2–4 independent measurements.GM1-rich cholesterol-richGM1/cholesterol/SM (40:30:30)15.8 ± 0.22.4 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.10.057 ± 0.001GM1-rich cholesterol-poorGM1/cholesterol/SM (40:12:48)16.2 ± 0.31.7 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.20.060 ± 0.001GM1-poor cholesterol-richGM1/cholesterol/SM (20:40:40)18.5 ± 0.52.9 ± 0.401-bLangmuir type (noncooperative binding) analysis was performed.0.019 ± 0.001GM1-poor cholesterol-poorGM1/cholesterol/SM (20:16:64)18.51-cAssumed to be the same as that of the GM1-poor cholesterol-rich system.3.0 ± 2.91-dThe large error is due to the absence of data points close to the origin (Fig. 4 B).01-bLangmuir type (noncooperative binding) analysis was performed.0.001 ± 0.0001-a Binding parameters from Equation 4 are the means ± S.D. obtained on 2–4 independent measurements.1-b Langmuir type (noncooperative binding) analysis was performed.1-c Assumed to be the same as that of the GM1-poor cholesterol-rich system.1-d The large error is due to the absence of data points close to the origin (Fig. 4 B). Open table in a new tab Excimer formation of BODIPY-GM1 was utilized to detect the GM1 cluster. The fluorophore BODIPY is known to form an excimer that emits red-shifted fluorescence (∼630 nm) compared with monomer (∼520 nm) (27Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1267-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The excimer formation, which occurs upon collision of two dye molecules (one is in the excited state), is facilitated by higher local concentration of the dye as well as lower membrane rigidity. Fig. 5 shows the fluorescence emission spectra of BODIPY-GM1-labeled liposomes. The spectra are normalized to the monomer peaks because the excimer/monomer fluorescence ratio is directly proportional to local dye concentration (28Förster T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1969; 8: 333-343Crossref Scopus (418) Google Scholar). BODIPY-GM1/GM1/cholesterol/SM (10:30:30:30) liposomes corresponding to the GM1-rich cholesterol-rich system exhibited a large excimer fluorescence (trace 1). In contrast, BODIPY-GM1/PC (10:90) liposomes with the identical dye content showed much weaker excimer fluorescence (trace 2). The anisotropy value of monomer fluorescence (r) as a measure of membrane rigidity of the latter membrane (0.046) was significantly smaller than that of the former (0.104). Therefore, BODIPY-GM1 forms an excimer much more easily in the former DIG-like environment despite its higher rigidity (higher anisotropy), strongly indicating that GM1 is present in a locally concentrated state, i.e. in a cluster. A reduction in total GM1 concentration from 40 to 20% markedly decreased excimer fluorescence (BODIPY-GM1/GM1/cholesterol/SM = 5:15:40:40, corresponding to the GM1-poor cholesterol-rich system, trace 3), although the intensity was much greater than that of the control BODIPY-GM1/PC (5:95) system (trace 5). The r value of the former (0.119) was again greater than that of the latter (0.041). It should be noted that the BODIPY-GM1/GM1 ratio remained constant at 1:3 in both GM1 40 and 20% systems. Therefore, if all GM1 molecules had been involved in the cluster formation, the same excimer fluorescence would have been observed. The weaker excimer fluorescence in the GM1-poor system indicated that the extent of clustering was smaller. BODIPY-GM1/GM1/cholesterol/SM (5:15:16:64) membranes corresponding to the GM1-poor cholesterol-poor system (r = 0.115, trace 4) exhibited further weaker excimer fluorescence compared with trace 3. Thus, the extent of clustering was in the order GM1-rich cholesterol-rich ≫ GM1-poor cholesterol-rich > GM1-poor cholesterol-poor, consistent with the order of the x max values (Table I). The excimer formation in BODIPY-GM1/GM1/cholesterol/SM (10:30:12:48) bilayers corresponding to the GM1-rich cholesterol-poor system was also examined. The excimer fluorescence was even larger than that of trace 1 (data not shown), but the r value was much smaller (0.064). Therefore, this system could not be directly compared with the other systems. The conformations of Aβ-(1–40) were estimated from CD spectra. Fig. 6 shows data of the GM1-rich cholesterol-rich system. The spectrum in buffer had a minimum at 197 nm, characteristic of unordered structures (trace 1). At lower GM1/Aβ ratios, the spectra exhibited shallow minima around 218 nm, reminiscent of β-sheets (Fig.6, traces 2 and 3). In contrast, the peptide adopted helical structures at higher GM1/Aβ ratios, as suggested by double minima around 209 and 222 nm (Fig. 6,traces 4 and 5). As estimated from the ellipticity at 222 nm (−13,000 degrees cm2dmol−1), the helicity at the largest GM1/Aβ value investigated was ∼40% (29Chang C.T. Wu C.-S.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). The absence of an isodichroic point indicated that the helix-to-sheet transition is not a simple two-state process. The GM1-rich cholesterol-poor system showed very similar CD spectra (data not shown). Aβ peptides with slight chemical modifications, such as 125I (30Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22987-22990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), have been widely used in many studies and provided valuable information. The DAC moiety employed in this study was as small as a single aromatic amino acid and was attached to the N terminus of Aβ. Indeed, DAC-Aβ behaved very similarly to the native peptide. First, DAC-Aβ shared the common binding site with native Aβ (Fig.2 B). Second, the interfacial location of the DAC moiety in membranes is fully compatible with the observation that native Aβ lies on the surface of GM1-containing membranes (13Matsuzaki K. Horikiri C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Third, DAC-Aβ showed lipid specificity identical to that of the native peptide, as described below. DAC-Aβ showed no affinity for phospholipids PC or PS but high affinities for GM1-containing membranes at physiological ionic strength (Fig. 3), consistent with previous studies using native (11ChooSmith L.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 13Matsuzaki K. Horikiri C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and Trp-labeled Aβ (14ChooSmith L.-P. Garzon-Rodriguez W. Glabe C.G. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22987-22990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Our study clearly indicated that Aβ does not bind cholesterol, because (i) DAC-Aβ was not bound to PC/cholesterol (2:1) liposomes (Fig. 3) and (ii) The cholesterol content in DIG-mimicking membranes did not correlate with Aβ-binding activity (Fig. 4). Wood's group (33Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Igbavboa U. Warden C.S. Vassiliev A.V. Wood W.G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) reported that aggregated but not freshly dissolved Aβ binds cholesterol, in accordance with our results. Binding of peptides to lipid bilayers has often been analyzed by a simple partition model that does not include the concept of binding sites, because in most cases the driving force of peptide binding is not specific molecular recognition but simple electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (34Schwarz G. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1989; 71: 1-9Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 35Wieprecht T. Apostolov O. Beyermann M. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 442-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 36Wieprecht T. Beyermann M. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10377-10387Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, Aβ obviously recognizes GM1 or more accurately gangliosides (10McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26482-26489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 11ChooSmith L.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 12McLaurin J. Franklin T. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 14ChooSmith L.-P. Garzon-Rodriguez W. Glabe C.G. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22987-22990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Therefore, the binding isotherms were analyzed by the cooperative binding model (Equation 4). The binding affinities, K, were practically the same (2–3 × 106m−1) for the four DIG-mimicking systems investigated (Table I). The competitive binding experiments (Fig.2 B) suggested that the K value of native Aβ is 40-fold smaller (∼ 6 × 104m−1), which corresponds to a difference in a Gibbs free energy of 2 kcal/mol. This value is a reasonable one for transfer of the DAC moiety from water to membrane interface (25White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). A binding affinity of 7 × 105m–1 was reported for the Y10W-Aβ-(1–40)-GM1 system (14ChooSmith L.-P. Garzon-Rodriguez W. Glabe C.G. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22987-22990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The Tyr-to-Trp substitution enhances membrane binding by ∼1 kcal/mol (25White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar), which corresponds to a 5-fold increase in affinity. Therefore, taken together with the present estimation, the affinity of native Aβ for GM1 is estimated to be ∼105m−1. Even in the absence of specific molecular recognition, binding isotherms are fitted by the Langmuir equation. TheK values for magainin 1-PS (37Matsuzaki K. Harada M. Handa T. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Yajima H. Miyajima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 981: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and calcitonin/dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (38Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Orlowski R.C. Schlueter R.J. Boni L.T. Hui S.W. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5074-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) systems were reported to be 3.8 × 105 and 1 × 105m−1), respectively, which were comparable with the estimated affinity of native Aβ. If individual GM1 molecules constitute binding sites for Aβ, the binding isotherms (Fig. 4 B) would be independent of lipid composition. However, the binding capacity increased quadratically with intramembrane GM1 content in the cholesterol-rich matrix (Fig.4 B and Table I), suggesting that some cooperative interactions between GM1 molecules generate the binding site. In accordance with this view, the membrane binding of native Aβ-(1–40) also requires a threshold GM1 content dependent on the lipid composition of the host matrix (12McLaurin J. Franklin T. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4506-4515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 13Matsuzaki K. Horikiri C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The most straightforward interpretation is that Aβ recognizes not monomeric but clustered GM1 or that in a GM1-enriched microdomain (39Ferraretto A. Pitto M. Palestini P. Masserini M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9232-9236Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the formation of which is regulated by cholesterol content. Indeed, a correlation was observed between binding capacity (x max in Table I) and excimer formation of BODIPY-GM1 as a measure of clustering (Fig. 5). However, the relationship between x max and excimer fluorescence was semiquantitative. Thex max value of the GM1-poor cholesterol-poor system was very small, whereas significant excimer fluorescence was observed (Fig. 5, trace 4), probably because the introduction of relatively high amounts of BODIPY-GM 1 (25% of total GM1) slightly affected domain formation. The excimer experiments also suggested that DIG-like environments play a crucial role in GM1 clustering. Ferraretto et al. reported that GM1 as well as cholesterol form GM1- and cholesterol-enriched domains in SM bilayers (39Ferraretto A. Pitto M. Palestini P. Masserini M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9232-9236Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is therefore plausible that at lower GM1 contents (e.g. 20%) an increase in cholesterol content, through segregation of cholesterol molecules by the cholesterol-rich domain formation, enhances local GM1 concentration, which leads to GM1 clustering (Fig. 4). In contrast, a GM1 content of 40% appears to be sufficient for effective formation of GM1-rich domains, and thus cholesterol content would have no further effect on GM1 clustering. In the PC matrix, a high level of excimer fluorescence was never observed despite its lower rigidity (Fig. 5, traces 2 and5). An electron microscopic study also indicated that GM1 is molecularly dispersed in fluid phosphatidylcholine bilayers at lower GM1 contents (40Thompson T.E. Allietta M. Brown R.E. Johnson M.L. Tillack T.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 817: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cooperativity was observed for peptide binding to the GM1-rich membranes with larger capacities. This may be related to conformational transition from α-helix-rich conformations at lower xvalues to β-sheet-rich conformations at higher x values (Fig. 6). The formation of the latter structures can involve interpeptide interactions. Terzi et al. (41Terzi E. Hölzemann G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14845-14852Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) reported similar structural transition in phosphatidylglycerol bilayers at low ionic strength. The presence of α/β structures was also found in ganglioside-containing membranes (10McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26482-26489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The conformational transition of the N-terminal region (residues 10–24) from α-helix to β-strand was reported to facilitate amyloid formation (42Soto C. Castano E.M. Frangione B. Inestrosa N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Recently, a great deal of attention has been focused on the pathological implications of altered cholesterol metabolism, which is likely to occur with aging or the expression of apolipoprotein E, in the development of AD. There is accumulating evidence that the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein, including Aβ generation, is significantly modulated by the content of cellular cholesterol (43Bodovitz S. Klein W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4436-4440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 44Racchi M. Baetta R. Salvietti N. Ianna P. Franceschini G. Paoletti R. Fumagalli R. Govoni S.

A. 1998; 95: 6460-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). It is particularly of interest that a recent study indicated that a unique Aβ species with seeding ability was generated by cultured cells in a cholesterol-dependent manner (46Mizuno T. Nakata M. Naiki H. Michikawa M. Wang R. Haass C. Yanagisawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15110-15114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Even with this information we are still far from understanding how cholesterol is involved in the development of AD, especially in the initiation of amyloid fibril formation. The results of the present study indicated, for the first time, that increases in the content of cholesterol in the membrane induce the formation of GM1/Aβ, one of the candidates as an endogenous seed for Alzheimer amyloid. With regard to the alteration of cholesterol in neuronal membranes, recent studies by Wood and co-workers (47Igbavboa U. Avdulov N.A. Schroeder F. Wood W.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1717-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 48Igbavboa U. Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Wood W.G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1661-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) are very informative. They reported that the content of cholesterol in the exofacial leaflets of synaptic plasma membrane is increased during aging (47Igbavboa U. Avdulov N.A. Schroeder F. Wood W.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1717-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and by apolipoprotein E deficiency (48Igbavboa U. Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Wood W.G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1661-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Taken together with the results of present study, these observations strongly suggest that alterations in the content of cholesterol in neuronal membranes underlie abnormal aggregation of Aβ in the AD brain. Finally, if Aβ forms amyloid fibrils via seeded polymerization in the brain with AD, then the seed could be a target for therapeutic and preventive treatment regimens for AD. Indeed, we have recently found that GM1/Aβ formed in DIG-like membranes works as a seed for fibril formation. 2H. Hayashi, K. Hasegawa, H. Yamaguchi, K. Matsuzaki, H. Naiki, and K. Yanagisawa, manuscript in preparation. To generate a compound that specifically recognizes GM1/Aβ and inhibits its seeding ability, it will be necessary to clarify the molecular processes underlying alterations of the secondary structures of Aβ via binding to and accumulation in GM1 “clusters.”"
https://openalex.org/W2144179854,"Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is phosphorylated at Ser-1179 (bovine sequence) by Akt after growth factor or shear stress stimulation of endothelial cells, resulting in increased eNOS activity. Purified eNOS is also phosphorylated at Thr-497 by purified AMP-activated protein kinase, resulting in decreased eNOS activity. We investigated whether bradykinin (BK) stimulation of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) regulates eNOS through Akt activation and Ser-1179 or Thr-497 phosphorylation. Akt is transiently activated in BK-stimulated BAECs. Activation is blocked completely by wortmannin and LY294002, inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, suggesting that Akt activation occurs downstream from phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. BK stimulates a transient phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1179 that is correlated temporally with a transient dephosphorylation of eNOS at Thr-497. Phosphorylation at Ser-1179, but not dephosphorylation at Thr-497, is blocked by wortmannin and LY294002. BK also stimulates a transient nitric oxide (NO) release from BAECs with a time-course similar to Ser-1179 phosphorylation and Thr-497 dephosphorylation. NO release is not altered by wortmannin. BK-stimulated dephosphorylation of Thr-497 and NO release are blocked by the calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporin A. These data suggest that BK activation of eNOS in BAECs primarily involves deinhibition of the enzyme through calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation at Thr-497."

Interestingly, SOCS expression is increased by agents known to induce insulin resistance, including IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and GH. These observations suggest that SOCS proteins could be the putative mediators of cytokine-induced insulin resistance. These studies were undertaken to test this hypothesis by determining whether SOCS proteins interact with the insulin receptor and alter its signaling activity. The isolation of the cDNA for human SOCS-1 has been described previously (7Dey B.R. Spence S.L. Nissley P. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24095-24101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The murine SOCS-6 cDNA was obtained from Dr. D. Hilton (The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Victoria). The pBIG-2i expression plasmid was a gift of Dr. Craig Strathdee (The John P. Robarts Research Institute, London, Ontario) (23Strathdee C.A. McLeod M.R. Hall J.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1999; 229: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The antibody to the C terminus of the insulin receptor (α-IRct) was a gift of Dr. J. N. Livingston (Bayer Corp., West Haven, CT), and α-IR-1 (24Kull F.C. Jacobs S. Su Y.F. Svoboda M.E. Van Wyk J.J. Cuatrecasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 25: 6561-6566Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. S. Jacobs (Wellcome Research Laboratories, Research Triangle Park, NC). The antibodies to phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-Akt (Ser-473) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA), respectively. The anti-FLAG antibodies M2 and M5 were from Sigma. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) and recombinant rat IRS-1 were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY. The transfection reagents GenePORTER and Fugene 6 were purchased from Gene Therapy Systems, Inc. (San Diego, CA) andRoche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. Other reagents were obtained from commercial sources as indicated in the text and figure legends. The SOCS-6 expression vector was constructed by amplifying the entire coding sequence of the murine SOCS-6 cDNA by polymerase chain reaction using upstream and downstream primers containing EcoRI and XhoI sites, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction product was first inserted into the matching sites in the yeast expression plasmid pJG4–5 (25Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Siedman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994: 13.14.1-13.14.17Google Scholar). Construction of the pJG-SOCS-1 plasmid has been described previously (7Dey B.R. Spence S.L. Nissley P. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24095-24101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The sequences of all polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments were confirmed by automatic ABI Prism DNA sequencing. The pBIG-2i-FLAG-SOCS-1 and -6 plasmids were constructed by ligating the EcoRI-XhoI fragments of the corresponding pJG derivatives into the pBIG-2i expression plasmid engineered to express an amino-terminal-linked FLAG epitope tag. McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells were grown to 75% confluence in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% equine serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. HepG2 human hepatoma cells were similarly grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with the pBIG-2i-FLAG-SOCS constructs or pBIG-2i-FLAG null vector using GenePORTER (pBIG-2i-FLAG-SOCS-6) or Fugene 6 (pBIG-2i-FLAG-SOCS-1) transfection reagents according to the manufacturers' instructions. FLAG-tagged SOCS-1 and -6 were also transiently expressed in COS cells using the same expression plasmids and protocols. McA-RH7777 cells were transfected with the human insulin receptor construct pHIRc (26Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Liao Y.-C. Tsubokawa M. Mason A. Seeburg P.H. Grunfeld C. Rosen O.M. Ramachanran J. Nature. 1985; 313: 756-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar) using the technique described above. A population of cells stably expressing the human insulin receptor was isolated with two cycles of cell sorting using a monoclonal anti-human insulin receptor antibody (α-IR-1). This cell population was designated McA-HIR. McA-HIR cells or HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the SOCS-1 or SOCS-6 constructs as described above. After 6 h, the cells were placed in serum-free medium for 18 h. Cells were then treated with insulin at 10−7m for 1 min. After two washes with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in Lysis Buffer A containing 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm benzamidine, protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), 2.5 mm pervanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. Lysates were passed 10 times through an 18-gauge needle, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and then adjusted to contain equal amounts of protein as determined by the Bradford method (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar). Insulin receptors were immunoprecipitated using an anti-human insulin receptor antibody (α-IR-1) bound to protein G-Sepharose. Immune complexes were washed 4 times with wash buffer (1% Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) and separated by SDS-PAGE (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar), and associated FLAG-tagged SOCS-1 and -6 were detected by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody. McA-RH7777 cells transiently expressing SOCS-1 or -6 were harvested after treatment with insulin for 5 min as described above. To analyze the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated with 4G10, and insulin receptors were detected by Western blotting using an antibody directed against the C terminus of the insulin receptor (α-IRct). Alternatively, receptors were immunoprecipitated with α-IRct, and phosphorylated receptors were detected by Western blotting using 4G10. To examine the effects of SOCS proteins on the insulin-dependent activation of Akt and ERK1/2, cell lysates obtained from insulin-treated (5 min) McA-RH7777 cells transiently expressing SOCS-1 or -6 were probed with antibodies selective for the phosphorylated, active forms of the kinases. Total ERK1/2 and Akt content was assayed by stripping the anti-phospho ERK1/2 transfer membrane and reprobing with anti-ERK1/2 or with anti-Akt antibodies. FLAG-tagged SOCS-1 and SOCS-6 were harvested from COS cells transiently expressing the proteins (see above) by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. COS cells were used for the isolation rather than McA-RH7777 cells because the former express few insulin receptors, thus avoiding the possible in vivocomplexing of SOCS proteins with endogenous insulin receptors. Insulin receptors were isolated from McA-HIRc cells using wheat germ agglutinin-agarose affinity chromatography. Briefly, ∼5 × 106 cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml bacitracin, 25 mm benzamidine, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After homogenization in a Dounce homogenizer and centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a column containing 1 ml of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated agarose beads. After 30 min at 4 °C, the column was drained dry and washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and the IR was eluted with buffer containing 300 mm N-acetylglucosamine, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Insulin (10−7m) and ATP (10 µm) were added to aliquots of the wheat germ agglutinin-purified receptors and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The receptor preparations were then added to the SOCS protein immunoprecipitates and incubated for an additional 30 min. Finally, 10 µm[γ-32P]ATP and recombinant IRS-1 (0.2 µg/50 µl reaction) were added, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped with Laemmli sample buffer, and the constituents were separated by SDS-PAGE. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel was treated with 1 n NaOH for 60 min at 55 °C, fixed, and dried. Analysis was by autoradiography. Previous studies have demonstrated that SOCS-2 and SOCS-3 interacted with the IGF-1 and/or insulin receptors in vitro,in vivo, and in the yeast two-hybrid system (7Dey B.R. Spence S.L. Nissley P. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24095-24101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 8Dey B.R. Furlanetto R.W. Nissley P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have found that SOCS-1 and SOCS-6 also interact with the IR in the yeast two-hybrid system (data not shown). The present studies were undertaken to determine whether SOCS-1 and SOCS-6 also interact with the IR in mammalian cells and whether they alter IR signal transduction. To determine whether SOCS-1 or SOCS-6 interacts with the IR in vivo, we transiently expressed the FLAG-tagged proteins in McA-HIR cells that stably overexpress the human IR. Transfected cells were harvested prior to or after insulin stimulation. The extracts were immunoprecipitated with insulin receptor antibody, and the coimmunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with FLAG antibody (Fig. 1,upper panels). SOCS expression in the transfected cells was confirmed by immunoblotting the total lysates with the FLAG antibody (Fig. 1, lower panels). A small amount of SOCS-1 protein was detected in IR immunoprecipitates from unstimulated cells. SOCS-6 was not detected in association with the IR in the absence of insulin. However, the detection of SOCS-1 and SOCS-6 was markedly increased in the immunoprecipitates following insulin stimulation (Fig. 1,upper panels). The corresponding bands were not observed in cells transfected with the empty vector. To confirm that the association of SOCS-1 and SOCS-6 with the IR was not limited to cells that overexpress the receptor, SOCS-1 and -6 were also expressed in HepG2 cells. The association of SOCS-1 and SOCS-6 with the endogenous IR was assessed by analyzing the FLAG-tagged SOCS proteins in the IR immunoprecipitates (Fig.2). In agreement with the results observed with the McA-HIR cells, SOCS-1 association with the IR was detectable in the absence of insulin, but the hormone markedly increased the interaction, whereas the association of SOCS-6 with the IR required insulin stimulation (Fig. 2, upper panels). These results demonstrate that both SOCS-1 and SOCS-6 associate with the IR in vivo and that receptor activation increases the association. To determine whether SOCS-1 or SOCS-6 affects IR phosphorylation, the FLAG-tagged proteins or the null vector was transiently expressed in the McA-RH7777 cells. The McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cell line was chosen because it has a well characterized insulin receptor signaling pathway (29Kulas D.T. Goldstein B.J. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2435-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Extracts prepared from insulin-stimulated or unstimulated cells were immunoprecipitated with a C terminus-specific IR antibody (α-IRct), and the precipitates were examined by Western blotting for phosphotyrosine (4G10) (Fig.3, upper panels). Insulin stimulated the receptor autophosphorylation comparably in cells transfected with either the empty vector or the SOCS constructs when examined by this method. However, when the cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with the phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) and the precipitates were then examined by Western blotting for the IR, insulin-dependent receptor autophosphorylation was not observed in cells expressing either SOCS protein (Fig. 3, middle panels). The expression of SOCS proteins produced only a small decrease in the total cellular levels of IR (Fig. 3, lower panels). These results demonstrate that the expression of either SOCS-1 or SOCS-6 in rat hepatoma cells in vivo does not inhibit insulin-stimulated IR phosphorylation. However, association of SOCS proteins with the IR blocks recognition of phosphotyrosine residues on the IR by the phosphotyrosine antibody, supporting our observation that these SOCS species form a stable complex with the IRin vivo. The next series of experiments was designed to determine whether SOCS-1 or SOCS-6 alters IR signal transduction. To this end, the effects of these SOCS proteins on IR-dependent activation of Akt and ERK1/2 were examined. McA-RH7777 cells expressing FLAG-tagged SOCS-1 or SOCS-6 or cells containing the empty vector were treated with insulin for 5 min before harvesting. The activation of Akt and ERK1/2 was assessed by Western blotting using antibodies selective for the active (phosphorylated) forms of these proteins. The expression of either SOCS-1 or SOCS-6 markedly inhibited insulin-dependent activation of both ERK1/2 (Fig. 4,A and B) and Akt (Fig. 4, C andD). It is noteworthy that there was no evidence that SOCS expression altered the low levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Akt present in the unstimulated cells. SOCS expression did not alter the total cellular levels of either ERK1/2 or Akt (Fig. 4, A andC). These results suggest that SOCS-1 and SOCS-6 inhibit insulin-dependent signal transduction. To determine whether SOCS proteins directly inhibit IR tyrosine kinase activity, immuno-isolated SOCS-1 or SOCS-6 was added to wheat germ agglutinin-purified IR prior to an in vitro kinase assay in which recombinant IRS-1 was used as the substrate. In this assay both SOCS proteins significantly inhibited insulin-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5) with SOCS-6 consistently being more potent than SOCS-1 in multiple experiments. These results suggest that SOCS-1 and SOCS-6 directly inhibit IR substrate phosphorylation, at least in vitro. The studies reported here were undertaken to determine whether specific SOCS proteins interact with the IR and inhibit its tyrosine kinase activity. They were based on the observation that certain SOCS species, including SOCS-1, -2, -3, and -6, interact with the type I IGF receptor and/or the IR in the yeast two-hybrid system (7Dey B.R. Spence S.L. Nissley P. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24095-24101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar,8Dey B.R. Furlanetto R.W. Nissley P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). 2R. W. Furlanetto, unpublished observations. The current studies focused on the interactions of SOCS-1 and -6 with the IR. We found that SOCS-1 and SOCS-6 interact with the IR in human hepatoma cells (HepG2) and in rat hepatoma cells overexpressing the human IR (McA-HIR). In both systems, an association of SOCS-1 with the IR was detectable in the absence of insulin treatment but was markedly increased by the hormone; in contrast, the association of SOCS-6 with the receptor required insulin treatment. In McA-RH7777 cells, neither SOCS-1 nor SOCS-6 inhibited insulin-stimulated IR autophosphorylation, but both SOCS proteins inhibited insulin-dependent activation of ERK1/2 and Akt kinase. Additionally, SOCS-1 and -6 inhibit insulin-dependent activation of IR tyrosine kinase in vitro, as demonstrated with recombinant IRS-1 as the substrate. These results suggest that the IR interacts directly with SOCS-1 and SOCS-6 or, if it interacts indirectly, that the intermediate protein(s) is present in both yeast and eukaryotic cells and is relatively tightly bound to the inactive receptor because the interaction was maintained after wheat germ agglutinin chromatography of the receptor and prior to its activation with insulin. In total, these findings suggest that SOCS-1 and SOCS-6 could play a role in cytokine-mediated insulin resistance. The results reported herein suggest that the IR signaling pathway can be suppressed through association with SOCS-1 and SOCS-6. Although this is the first report to demonstrate the inhibition of the IR tyrosine kinase by SOCS proteins, the association of this family of proteins with the IR family of receptors has been reported previously. We earlier reported that SOCS-2 (7Dey B.R. Spence S.L. Nissley P. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24095-24101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and SOCS-3 (8Dey B.R. Furlanetto R.W. Nissley P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) associate with the IGF-1 receptor both in vivo and in vitro. Emanuelli et al. (30Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) implicated SOCS-3 as an inhibitor of insulin-dependent activation of STAT-5B but did not observe an inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Nonetheless, their data suggested that binding to tyrosine 960 of the IR was essential for SOCS-3-dependent inhibition. We have not yet determined whether SOCS-2 or SOCS-3 inhibits IR kinase activity or signaling in our system nor have we mapped the sites of interaction of SOCS-1 or SOCS-6 with the IR. Several studies have examined the mechanisms by which CIS, SOCS-1, and SOCS-3 inhibit cytokine signaling, and it appears that these proteins employ several different mechanisms. CIS, the first SOCS family member to be identified, inhibits erythropoietin signaling by binding to a phosphotyrosine residue on the receptor (Y401), which is also a STAT-5 binding site, thereby competing with STAT-5 for binding and preventing its phosphorylation (12Yoshimura A.

In contrast, SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 inhibit cytokine signaling by inhibiting the JAK kinases, although by slightly different mechanisms. SOCS-1 inhibits IL-1, -4, and -6 and interferon-γ signaling by binding directly to and inhibiting the associated Janus kinases (10Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto S. Mitsui K.

In contrast, SOCS-3 inhibits GH signaling by binding to phosphotyrosine residues on the GH receptor itself; this association allows SOCS-3 to then interact with and inhibit the receptor-bound JAK2 kinase (33Hansen J.A. Lindberg K. Hilton D.J. Nielsen J.H. Billestrup N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1832-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Cohney S.J. Sanden D. Cacalano N.A. Yoshimura A. Mui A. Migone T.S. Johnston J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4980-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The JAK kinase inhibitory activities of both SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 have been mapped to a common motif in the distal amino-terminal regions of these proteins, which appears to function as a pseudosubstrate that interacts with the active site and blocks access of legitimate substrates (31Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka A. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 32Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Farley A. Starr R. Zhang J.G. Baca M. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A.

S. A. 1998; 95: 13130-13134Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In support of this, it has been shown that the amino-terminal domains of SOCS-1 and -3 can bind to JAK2 when overexpressed in cells (31Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka A. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 32Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Farley A. Starr R. Zhang J.G. Baca M. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar,33Hansen J.A. Lindberg K. Hilton D.J. Nielsen J.H. Billestrup N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1832-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that we found that (overexpressed) SOCS-1 also binds to the IR independent of receptor activation. It has also been reported that the binding of SOCS-3 to the IGF-1 receptor does not require receptor activation (8Dey B.R. Furlanetto R.W. Nissley P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In both instances, however, the binding of the native proteins (i.e. containing the SH2 domain) is enhanced by receptor activation. These observations suggest a model in which receptor autophosphorylation provides binding sites for the SH2 domain of SOCS-1, which then enhances the interaction of the amino-terminal inhibitory domain with the active site of the receptor. Our observation that the interaction of SOCS-6 with the IR requires receptor activation suggests that SOCS-6 may inhibit substrate phosphorylation by a different mechanism, but additional experiments will be necessary to confirm this speculation. The SOCS proteins have been shown to inhibit signaling by two additional mechanisms. SOCS-1 has been shown to associate with Grb-2, the p85 regulatory subunit of PI-3 kinase, and the Rho-family guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav through determinants in the SOCS-1 amino-terminal domain (36De Sepulveda P. Okkenhaug K. La Rosse J. Hawley R.G. Dubreuil P. Rottapel R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These interactions are believed to play a role in the suppression of Kit receptor signaling by SOCS-1. These or similar interactions could also play a role in the inhibition by SOCS-1 of IR signaling in vivo, but they could not account for the inhibition of IR kinase activity that we observed in the in vitro kinase assay. Such a mechanism would not apply to SOCS-6 because there is no evidence that SOCS-6 binds to other signaling proteins, and analysis of its amino acid sequence revealed no recognizable binding motifs for these proteins. Finally, it has been shown that the SOCS proteins can inhibit signaling by targeting their partners for proteosome degradation (37Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 38Verdier F. Chretien S. Muller O. Varlet P. Yoshimura A. Gisselbracht S. Lacombe C. Mayeux P. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 2071-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). This activity appears to be mediated by the SOCS motif, which contains a functional BC box similar to that in Elongin A and the von Hippel-Lindau protein (37Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Enhanced proteosomal degradation of the IR could contribute to the inhibition of IR signaling in vivo but would not be expected to contribute to the rapid inhibition observed in the experiments reported here (i.e. within 1–5 min of insulin addition) or in the in vitro experiments. It has been known for some time that inflammatory processes, sepsis, cachexia, GH excess, and obesity are associated with reversible insulin resistance. Importantly, these clinical conditions are also associated with major increases in circulating cytokine levels (1Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 2Kruszynska Y.T. Olefsky J.M. J. Investig. Med. 1996; 44: 413-438PubMed Google Scholar). Most relevant to the current report, several of the cytokines implicated in insulin resistance, such as Il-1β, Il-6, GH, and TNFα, have been shown to induce SOCS-1 expression in target tissues. In mice, IL-6 and GH rapidly induce hepatic expression of SOCS-1in vivo (9Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J.L. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A.

Naka T. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 2000; 11: 5833-5843Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). There are no data on the expression of SOCS-1 in other insulin-responsive tissues in vivo, on the long-term effects of cytokines on its expression, or on its expression in insulin-resistant or diabetic animals. Very little is known about the expression, regulation, or function of SOCS-6, which was identified based on its shared C-terminal SOCS box consensus sequence (15Masuhara M. Sakamoto H. Matsumoto A. Suzuki R. Yasukawa H. Mitsui K. Wakioka T. Tanimura S. Sasaki A. Misawa H. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). SOCS-6 has not previously been implicated in any cytokine signaling pathway, and it does not interact with JAK2, lck, c-Kit, or the erythropoietin, IL-2, or fibroblast growth factor receptors (15Masuhara M. Sakamoto H. Matsumoto A. Suzuki R. Yasukawa H. Mitsui K. Wakioka T. Tanimura S. Sasaki A. Misawa H. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In fact, the IR represents the only SOCS-6 binding partner identified to date. The tissue distribution and regulation of expression of SOCS-6 have not been established. In summary, we propose a model to explain the mechanism of insulin resistance mediated by cytokines. SOCS protein expression is induced in target tissues in response to the cytokines. SOCS-1 and SOCS-6 can associate with the IR and suppress receptor signaling at the level of the receptor tyrosine kinase. In light of evidence demonstrating increases in cytokine levels in inflammatory states, acromegaly, and obesity, the potential contribution of this inhibitory pathway to insulin resistance and type II diabetes should be explored.

Here we report that male mice in which the PLCdelta4 gene had been disrupted either produced few small litters or were sterile. In vitro fertilization studies showed that insemination with PLCdelta4-/- sperm resulted in significantly fewer eggs becoming activated and that the calcium transients associated with fertilization were absent or delayed. PLCdelta4-/- sperm were unable to initiate the acrosome reaction, an exocytotic event required for fertilization and induced by interaction with the egg coat, the zona pellucida. These data demonstrate that PLCdelta4 functions in the acrosome reaction that is induced by the zona pellucida during mammalian fertilization."

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) rendered deficient in BER by gene deletion of a BER enzyme are hypersensitive to monofunctional DNA-methylating agents among other stressors, illustrating the importance of this repair system (3Ochs K.

The current and generally accepted working model for mammalian BER involves two sub-pathways, each proceeding as a sequential process with several DNA and/or DNA-enzyme intermediates (6Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In each of the BER sub-pathways, repair can be initiated by spontaneous base loss or DNA glycosylase action to produce an abasic site and in some cases by coupled glycosylase base removal and strand cleavage (1Lindahl T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 61-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 10Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3405-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 11Slupphaug G.

When the intact abasic site is an intermediate, DNA strand cleavage on the 5′ side of the sugar is by the abundant nuclear enzyme apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE), and cleavage on the 3′ side of the sugar is by the deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) lyase activity of DNA polymerase β (β-pol) (12Doetsch P.W. Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 13Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The single nucleotide gap is filled by β-pol, and then the nick is eventually sealed by a DNA ligase, thus completing the %short patch” or %single nucleotide” BER sub-pathway (7Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 14Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K. Molina J.T. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J.

In mammalian cells, repair of methylated bases, oxidized bases, and abasic sites appears to occur predominantly by this sub-pathway (16Dianov G. Bischoff C. Piotrowski J. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33811-33816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 17Klungland A. Hoss M. Gunz D. Constantinou A. Clarkson S.G. Doetsch P.W. Bolton P.H. Wood R.D.

In other cases, for example where the sugar of the abasic site is not removed efficiently, the %long patch” BER sub-pathway mediates repair (18Prasad R. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4460-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This sub-pathway involves limited strand displacement and DNA synthesis to replace between 2 and as many as 15 nucleotides in the damaged strand (5Wilson S.H. Mutat.

Finally, this displaced damaged strand is excised by the structure-specific flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1), and the resulting nick is sealed by a DNA ligase (14Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K.

Yet the mechanism and regulation for each of these interactions are either completely obscure or only beginning to be revealed, and the functional implications of the interactions concerning the efficiency and accuracy of BER are unknown. In the experiments to be described in this report, we examined the interaction between PARP-1 and BER intermediates.PARP-1 is an abundant nuclear enzyme that is known to bind to DNA nicks and becomes activated to enzymatically poly(ADP-ribosyl)ate many nuclear proteins, including itself, using NAD+ as substrate. Self poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP-1 is known to cause it to release from its DNA-binding site (reviewed in Ref. 30D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem.

Among other points, they found that extracts from PARP-1 null MEF were moderately reduced in single nucleotide BER activity and strongly reduced in long patch BER activity pointing to a role of PARP-1 in both sub-pathways and a requirement for PARP-1 in long patch BER (29Dantzer F. de La Rubia G.

In addition, PARP-1 null MEF cells are known to be hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agents that produce lesions repaired by BER (37Dantzer F. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Flatter E.

It was also found that PARP-1 can activate DNA ligase during repair in vitro (39Creissen D. Shall S. Nature. 1982; 296: 271-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and recently it was shown that PARP-1, β-pol, and DNA ligase III/XRCC1 form a BER complex that can support the ATP requirement for DNA ligation of the nick (40Oei S.L. Ziegler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23234-23239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is considered well documented that PARP-1 has a role in BER, yet the molecular mechanism of its participation has remained obscure.In this study, we examined the question of whether proteins in MEF crude extracts can be selectively labeled by a photoaffinity DNA probe representing an early intermediate in long patch BER. We found that only six proteins in the crude extract were strongly labeled by this BER probe, including several well known BER enzymes. The results described here reveal several important features of molecular interactions between BER enzymes and BER intermediates.DISCUSSIONThe identity of the various enzymes participating in mammalian BER is a subject of active investigation. In this study, we used a sensitive, novel photoaffinity labeling reagent to identify BER enzymes in the crude extract of MEF cells. For the two BER sub-pathways, a nicked DNA structure is considered a branch point in BER sub-pathway choice, and one can consider a nicked DNA structure with areduced abasic site sugar, as used here, as representing an early intermediate frozen at the stage just prior to dRP lyase action in single nucleotide BER or at the stage just prior to strand displacement DNA synthesis in the long patch BER sub-pathway (6Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4460-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, we evaluated cross-linking of MEF proteins to such a DNA structure as a novel approach toward probing for cellular enzymes involved in BER. The use of a 32P-labeled DNA with a sensitive photoreactive group at the 3′-margin of the nick permitted cross-linking with near-UV light instead of 254 nm UV light. This photoreactive BER intermediate was synthesized in situ (most likely by β-pol) using a base-substituted dCTP analog carrying a photoreactive arylazido group at the fourth position of the base. The dNTP analog is known to be a good substrate for DNA polymerases (50Doronin S.V. Dobrikov M.I. Buckle M. Roux P. Buc H. Lavrik O.I. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 200-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 51Doronin S.V. Dobrikov M.I. Lavrik O.I. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 31-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 52Lavrik O.I.

Shishkin G.V. Wood T.G. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21891-21897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This property permits introduction of the photoreactive dCMP moiety into the 3′-margin of a gap in DNA, thus creating the photoreactive BER intermediate within the cell extract (Fig. 3). The DNA probe does not participate in downstream processes of BER in the cell extract, namely strand displacement DNA synthesis or DNA ligation, because a polynucleotide ending in the FAB-dCMP moiety is a very poor substrate for either process. We provide evidence here that the main target for BER protein interaction with this DNA is the BER intermediate structure, rather than the two ends of the DNA oligomer or a nick with a 5′-phosphate group.When irradiated with near-UV light, the DNA probe synthesized in situ could be cross-linked to the DNA polymerase or, after its dissociation, to other proteins capable of interacting with a nicked DNA structure. We regard this latter possibility as likely, because an excess of DNA probe over DNA polymerase or other individual cellular proteins was used in these experiments. Therefore, cellular proteins interacting preferentially with a photoreactive BER intermediate can be selected from the proteins in the crude cellular extract. This approach may have advantages in the study of specific transactions of DNA and DNA enzymes in cellular extract systems.We found that protein labeling with the cellular extract was highly specific, as only six proteins were strongly labeled. Four of these turned out to be well known members of the BER machinery, PARP-1, FEN-1, β-pol, and APE. These proteins, except for APE, were identified as the labeled products using various approaches including immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies (Figs. 4 and 5). Two additional proteins of molecular mass of ∼30 kDa were observed to be affinity labeled also, but their identity was not pursued further in this study.PARP-1 is an abundant cellular protein and is well known to be a nicked DNA sensor (2Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 30D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem.

Therefore, it is not surprising that PARP-1 was a target of labeling by the photoreactive BER intermediate used as probe in these experiments. We found that PARP-1 was by far the most heavily labeled protein and that several other well known BER proteins such as DNA ligases I and III and XRCC1 were not labeled. In view of the strong labeling of PARP-1 and the fact that PARP-1 has an important, but as yet unknown role in BER, we chose to examine requirements for PARP-1 labeling in detail. PARP-1 labeling in the MEF extract used in these experiments satisfied several criteria of affinity labeling using photoreactive nicked DNA; labeling varied as a function of the structure of the DNA probe; labeling was highest for a nick carrying an abasic site sugar phosphate at the 5′-margin, indicating that PARP-1 recognition of this BER intermediate was sensitive and specific; labeling could be competed by oligonucleotides representing BER intermediates but not by double-stranded DNA.Immunoprecipitation experiments with an anti-FLAG-β-pol antibody system revealed some co-precipitation of PARP-1, FEN-1, and β-pol, each cross-linked individually to a molecule of labeled DNA probe. This indicated protein-protein interaction between PARP-1 and β-pol and is in accord with the results reported by Dantzer et al. (29Dantzer F. de La Rubia G. Menissier-De Murcia J. Hostomsky Z. de Murcia G. Schreiber V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7559-7569Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). These workers found that PARP-1 interacts with the C-terminal portion of β-pol in the presence of DNA (29Dantzer F. de La Rubia G. Menissier-De Murcia J. Hostomsky Z. de Murcia G. Schreiber V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7559-7569Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they used extracts from cells made genetically deficient in β-pol and/or PARP-1 and demonstrated that both proteins are involved in the BER of uracil-derived abasic sites. In the absence of both PARP-1 and β-pol, both BER sub-pathways were reduced (29Dantzer F. de La Rubia G. Menissier-De Murcia J. Hostomsky Z. de Murcia G. Schreiber V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7559-7569Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The deletion of PARP-1 had a dramatic effect on long patch BER capacity measured in vitrousing the cell extract, yet the mechanism of the role of PARP-1 in BER is still not clear (2Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 30D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar).Our results on the requirements for PARP-1 recognition of BER intermediates show that the enzyme interacts most avidly with DNA nicks containing a sugar phosphate at the 5′-margin. This specificity of PARP-1 toward binding a sugar moiety at the 5′-margin of a nick in a single-stranded break suggests that PARP-1 recognizes a BER intermediate with this structure. This intermediate is formed in BER after introduction of a dNMP moiety by β-pol but before sub-pathway choice leading to either single nucleotide BER or long patch BER. Therefore, our data point to a potential role of PARP-1 in both BER sub-pathways. The conclusion is consistent with the effect of PARP inhibitors on MMS-induced cytotoxicity in the cell lines used in these experiments. It appears that PARP plays a role in repair of MMS-induced lesions, and we inferred that this reflects the role of PARP in both BER pathways. We also found co-precipitation of PARP-1, FEN-1, and β-pol cross-linked to the DNA probe using antibodies to the FLAG epitope attached to β-pol (Fig. 8). These data, again, show interaction for these key BER proteins in a complex at a branch point intermediate of BER. It is interesting that preferential PARP-1 binding to this BER intermediate could stimulate the known rate-limiting steps of BER, such as the β-pol-dependent strand displacement required in long patch BER and the dRP excision step required in single nucleotide BER. Thus, PARP-1 association in this way could be an important event in the overall efficiency of BER and in sub-pathway selection. Work is currently in progress to explore these possibilities. Base excision repair (BER)1 is one of the main strategies of the cell for defense against exogenous and endogenous genotoxic stress leading to single-base lesions in DNA (1Lindahl T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 61-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 2Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) rendered deficient in BER by gene deletion of a BER enzyme are hypersensitive to monofunctional DNA-methylating agents among other stressors, illustrating the importance of this repair system (3Ochs K.

The current and generally accepted working model for mammalian BER involves two sub-pathways, each proceeding as a sequential process with several DNA and/or DNA-enzyme intermediates (6Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol.

In each of the BER sub-pathways, repair can be initiated by spontaneous base loss or DNA glycosylase action to produce an abasic site and in some cases by coupled glycosylase base removal and strand cleavage (1Lindahl T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 61-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 10Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3405-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 11Slupphaug G.

When the intact abasic site is an intermediate, DNA strand cleavage on the 5′ side of the sugar is by the abundant nuclear enzyme apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE), and cleavage on the 3′ side of the sugar is by the deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) lyase activity of DNA polymerase β (β-pol) (12Doetsch P.W. Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 13Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The single nucleotide gap is filled by β-pol, and then the nick is eventually sealed by a DNA ligase, thus completing the %short patch” or %single nucleotide” BER sub-pathway (7Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 14Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K. Molina J.T. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, repair of methylated bases, oxidized bases, and abasic sites appears to occur predominantly by this sub-pathway (16Dianov G. Bischoff C. Piotrowski J. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33811-33816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 17Klungland A. Hoss M. Gunz D. Constantinou A. Clarkson S.G. Doetsch P.W. Bolton P.H. Wood R.D.

In other cases, for example where the sugar of the abasic site is not removed efficiently, the %long patch” BER sub-pathway mediates repair (18Prasad R. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4460-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This sub-pathway involves limited strand displacement and DNA synthesis to replace between 2 and as many as 15 nucleotides in the damaged strand (5Wilson S.H. Mutat.

Interestingly, MT1-MMP becomes degraded to an inactive 43-kDa form during the MMP-2 activation (28Lehti K. Lohi J. Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem.

In addition to its ability to activate MMP-2, MT1-MMP has intrinsic ECM degrading activity (32Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol.

Therefore MT1-MMP and MMP-2 activities at the cell surface provide a powerful combination for the localized ECM remodeling (33D'Ortho M.P. Will H. Atkinson S. Butler G. Messent A. Gavrilovic J.

To evaluate the hypothesis that MT1-MMP/MMP-2 proteolytic cascade might play a functional role in Rac1-induced tumor cell invasion through type I collagen-rich tissue barrier, we examined an invasive HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line that showed elevated level of active MMP-2 during cell-fibrillar collagen interaction (38Azzam H.S. Thompson E.W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4540-4544PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we provide evidence that Rac1 is a mediator of collagen-stimulated MMP-2 activation and MT1-MMP expression/processing, collagenolytic activity, and cell invasion through 3D-col. Furthermore, active MMP-2 contributes to Rac1-induced collagen invasive activity. Our findings suggest that Rac1 mediates MMP-2 activation and MT1-MMP expression/processing during the encounter between invading tumor cells and type I collagen-rich stroma, thereby facilitating collagenolysis and cell invasion. HT1080 fibrosarcoma and HEp3 epidermoid carcinoma cell lines were maintained in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). Stably transfected cell lines were maintained in medium that included 200 μg/ml G418 in addition to the above mentioned supplements. Plasmids RSV-neo-%-galactosidase, c-Myc-tagged Rac1V12N17, and Rac1V12 were kindly provided by Dr. Lorne Taichman, SUNY at Stony Brook, and Dr. Alan Hall, University College London, London, United Kingdom. Plasmids containing cDNAs for MT1-MMP, MMP-2, TIMP-2, and 36B4 were purchased from ATCC. Subconfluent cell culture was co-transfected with one of testing plasmids (Rac1V12N17, Rac1V12, and vector) and a plasmid construct containing the neomycin-resistant gene by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique as previously described (39Xu J. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After transfection, individual colonies from Rac1V12N17- and Rac1V12-transfected cells were isolated after 2–3 weeks of 500 μg/ml G418 selection. As control, vector-transfected clones were pooled. All stably transfected cell lines were maintained in growth medium containing 200 μg/ml G418. Cells grown on tissue culture plates in growth medium (10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum/DMEM) were washed twice with serum-free medium before the addition of serum-free medium supplemented with 0.2% heat-inactivated lactoalbumin and 50 μg/ml concanavalin A (Sigma). Medium was then collected after 16–24 h for zymography. Type I collagen or fibrin gel cultures were prepared according to a procedure previously described with some modification (40Xu J. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Pepsin-solubilized bovine dermal collagen dissolved in 0.012 m HCl was 99.9% pure containing 95–98% type I collagen and 2–5% type III collagen (Vitrogen 100, Collagen Corp). Briefly, cells detached from tissue culture plates in growth medium were washed with warm DMEM twice before being seeded into a serum-free solution that contained 2 mg/ml vitrogen or 3 mg/ml fibrinogen (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). Subsequently, cell-collagen or cell-fibrinogen suspension (5 × 105cells/ml) was plated onto 24-well plates at 250 μl/well or 35-mm plastic dishes at 1.5 ml/dish. Cell-collagen cultures were incubated at 37 °C to form gel. The gelling of cell-fibrin cultures occurred in less than 5 min at room temperature after the addition of thrombin to a final concentration of 0.2 unit/ml. After both collagen and fibrin cell cultures formed gel, serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.2% heat-inactivated lactoalbumin was added. Gels remained attached to the plastic dish for the duration of incubation. Conditioned medium was collected from cells cultured for 18–24 h in serum-free medium. To analyze the activity of cell-associated MMP-2, cells (7.5 × 105) in 35-mm plates were released from collagen or fibrin gel after digestion with bacterial collagenase D (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) for 10 min or dispase (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA) for 5 min, respectively. Cells were washed gently with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline 10–12 times and suspended in 150 μl of 1 × SDS sample buffer. Aliquots (total cell lysates) were immediately processed for enzymatic assay using zymography. Substrate zymography was performed as described previously with some modifications (41Herron G.S. Banda M.J. Clark E.J. Gavrilovic J. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2814-2818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Gogly B. Groult N. Hornebeck W. Godeau G. Pellat B. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide (12% unless indicated in the figure legend) gels were co-polymerized with 1 mg/ml gelatin or 0.5 mg/ml type I collagen (Sigma). Samples (conditioned medium or total cell lysates) were resolved under nonreducing conditions. Gels were washed twice in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min and incubated overnight in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3 (gelatin substrate) or 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.005% Brij-35, and 0.02% NaN3 (type I collagen substrate). At the end of the incubation, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and destained. Actin organization was visualized by staining with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells in serum-free vitrogen solution were plated in 8-well chamber slides to form gel. After 24 h, cells in collagen gel were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with acetone at −20 °C, and stained with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin for 30 min at room temperature. The images were captured using an epifluorescence microscope by the University Microscopy Imaging Center, SUNY at Stony Brook. Total RNA was isolated from cells cultured in collagen or fibrin gel for 10 h and Northern analysis was performed as previously described (40Xu J. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). RNA was detected with α-32P-labeled cDNA probes for MT1-MMP and TIMP-2. Control probe was 36B4 cDNA. Cell extracts were prepared using a detergent extraction method described by Lee et al. (30Lee A.Y. Akers K.T. Collier M. Li L. Eisen A.Z. Seltzer J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4424-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Briefly, cells cultured in collagen or fibrin gel were washed gently with cold phosphate-buffered saline three times, transferred into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, and subject to centrifugation to remove as much solution as possible. The pellet was suspended in a Triton X-100 lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100 in 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl in the presence of protein inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and forced through a syringe with a 26-gauge needle several times. The supernatant after centrifugation was designated as cell extracts for Western analysis. Western blotting analysis was performed as previously described (43Xu J. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). After detection by monoclonal antibodies against Rac1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), MMP-2 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), TIMP-2, and MT1-MMP (Calbiochem-Novabiochem), the blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The capacity of cells to degrade type I collagen fibrils was assessed based on the modification of a procedure as described (35Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Cell. 1999; 99: 81-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 μl of vitrogen solution at 1 mg/ml was added to each well of a 24-well plate and allowed to air-dry overnight. The collagen fibril film was washed with several changes of distilled water and serum-free DMEM before a pellet of 4 × 104 cells in 25 μl of 10% fetal bovine serum/DMEM was dotted onto the center of each well. Cells were allowed to attach for 5 h, washed twice with serum-free DMEM, and then incubated for 3 days in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.2% lactoalbumin. Following the incubation, cells were removed with trypsin/EDTA and collagen remaining in the wells was visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. For quantification of fibrillar type I collagen degradation, type I rat tail collagen (Becton Dickinson) was labeled with [3H]acetic anhydride (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the protocols described (44Birkedal-Hansen H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 140-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 45Mookhtiar K.A. Mallya S.K. Van Wart H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 158: 322-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 150 μl of3H-labeled type I collagen (0.5–1 × 106cpm/mg protein) was allowed to polymerize in individual wells of a 48-well plate. Cells at 1.5 × 104/300 μl were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C. To follow the progressive degradation of collagen fibrils, aliquots (50 μl) of the medium were collected after 24 and 48 h. The soluble radioactivity was quantified in a liquid scintillation counter. A cDNA clone K-121 that contains the coding sequence for MMP-2 with a partially truncated propeptide domain (46Huhtala P. Eddy R.L. Fan Y.S. Byers M.G. Shows T.B. Tryggvason K. Genomics. 1990; 6: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was used as a template for amplification with polymerase chain reaction. The regions corresponding to residues Gly417-Cys631 (C-terminal hemopexin-like domain; CTD) or Val191-Gln364(fibronectin type-II-like modules; CBD) of MMP-2 proenzyme, respectively, were amplified. The resulting fragments were inserted into a pGEX-3X plasmid, respectively (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were purified on Sepharose 4B-coupled glutathione beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) based on the manufacturer's instructions. The assay was performed using the modification of procedures previously described (47Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar). 50 μl of vitrogen solution at 1 mg/ml was applied to the upper compartment of each well in a 24-well Transwell plate (8-μm pore size; Costar) and allowed to gel at 37 °C. Cells at 5 × 104 in 200 μl of serum-free DMEM were added to the upper chamber. Culture medium was added to the lower compartment. In indicated experiments, inhibitors or controls were added to both upper and lower chambers at the following final concentrations: 25 μm SC68180 (formerly SC44463,N-[3-(N′-hydroxycarboxamido)-2-(2-methylpropyl)propanoyl]-O-methyl-l-tyrosine-N-methylamide; a generous gift of Dr. W. C. Parks, Washington University, St. Louis), 100 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 500 ng/ml recombinant TIMP-1 (Chemicon), 500 ng/ml recombinant TIMP-2 (Chemicon), 100 μm furin inhibitor Dec-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-CH2Cl (Bachem Biochemicals), 500 ng/ml CTD (Gly417-Cys631), and 500 ng/ml CBD (Val191-Gln364). The invasion proceeded for 24 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the filters were fixed and stained with Diff-Quick staining kit (Fisher Scientific). The cells that reached the underside of the filter were counted. For each filter, the number of cells in 10 randomly chosen microscope fields was determined and averaged. Three invasion chambers were used per condition. The final values were the average of triplicates. A human fibrosarcoma cell line, HT1080, was transfected with dominant negative Rac1V12N17, constitutively active Rac1V12, or a vector control. Ectopic Rac1 expression was examined by Western analysis in G418-resistant clones. In a representative experiment, a monoclonal antibody against Rac1 detected both ectopic Rac1 tagged with c-Myc (upper band) and endogenous Rac1 (lower band) in lysates of cells expressing Rac1V12N17 (HN) and Rac1V12 (HV), but only endogenous Rac1 in vector-transfected cell extracts (HW) (Fig.1 A). Clones that express comparable levels of Rac1 were selected for further study. Cells were embedded in 3D-col in serum-free medium for 24 h and subject to morphological examination. To view single cells in type I collagen matrix, the entire cell-containing 3D-col was stained with rhodamine phalloidin. As shown in Fig. 1 B, HW and HV cells developed long protrusions extending from cell body, whereas HN cells possessed a compact morphology (Fig. 1 B, panels a-c). Interestingly, HV cells displayed multiple membrane protrusions (Fig.1 B, panel c). Cell organization in 3D-col was visualized by phase-contrast microscopy (Fig. 1 B, panels d-f). Consistent with the single cell morphology, HV cells were assembled into complex branching tubular networks (Fig. 1 B, panel f). In contrast, HN cells failed to demonstrate organized structure (Fig. 1 B, panel e). Because the branching phenotype of carcinoma cells has been associated with their metastatic capacity (47Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar), whether Rac1 mediates HT1080 cell invasion was assessed. Rac1V12 substantially increased, whereas Rac1V12N17 reduced, HT1080 cell invasion across 3D-col (Fig.1 C). To assess whether MMPs or plasminogen activator (PA)/plasmin system is responsible for this process, we monitored cell invasion in the presence of inhibitors for MMPs and PA/plasmin system, SC68180 and aprotinin, respectively. SC68180, formally known as SC44463, is a hydroxymate compound that has been shown to inhibit human keratinocyte migration on native type I collagen as a general MMP inhibitor (48Pilcher B.K. Dumin J.A. Sudbeck B.D. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 D, invasion of HW and HV cells through 3D-col was inhibited by SC68180. Interestingly, the active Rac1-induced cell invasion was reduced ∼90% by the MMP inhibitor. In contrast, aprotinin did not impact on the collagen invasiveness. These data indicate that invasion of HT1080 cells across collagen depends on both Rac1 and MMP activities and that Rac1 requires MMP activities to promote cell invasion. To investigate the Rac1-mediated MMP activity in HT1080 cells surrounded by collagen matrix, we monitored MMP production by gelatin zymography in these cell lines when cultured in 3D-col for 24 h (Fig.2 A). The conditioned medium of HEp3, an epidermoid carcinoma cell line that secretes MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 as detected by gelatin zymography (49Kim J., Yu, W. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. Cell. 1998; 94: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), was used as a control (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). Four major gelatinolytic bands with different intensity were detected in the serum-free medium of HW cell culture (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). These bands corresponded to the inactive MMP-9 proenzyme (92 kDa) and three MMP-2 species, latent (L), intermediate (i), and active (A). Interstitial collagenase MMP-1 was undetectable in HT1080-derived cell lines in gelatin (Fig.2 A) as well as type I collagen zymography (Fig.2 B), a method that more sensitively detects MMP-1 than does MMP-2 (42Gogly B. Groult N. Hornebeck W. Godeau G. Pellat B. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The distribution of three MMP-2 species was distinctly altered by the stable expression of Rac1V12N17 (HN) and Rac1V12 (HV). Active and latent MMP-2 became the major species in HV and HN cells, respectively (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2–4), suggesting Rac1 specifically mediates MMP-2 proenzyme processing cells cultured in 3D-col. Active MMP-9 was not detected in this system; instead, latent MMP-9 at 92 kDa was detected at low level in both HW and HV cells, but nearly undetectable in HN cells (Fig. 2 A). Cells cultured in fibrin gel were used as control. Unlike 3D-col that induced MMP-2 processing, fibrin gel did not promote MMP-2 activation (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2 and 5). Predominantly latent MMP-2, as well as low level of the i"
https://openalex.org/W1990002392,"Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of GAA·TTC repeats in the first intron of the frataxin (X25) gene. FRDA patients carrying two expanded GAA·TTC repeats show very low levels of mature frataxin mRNA and protein. A novel type of unusual DNA structure, sticky DNA, was previously found in the expanded GAA·TTC repeats from FRDA patients. To evaluate the effect of sticky DNA on transcription, in vitro transcription studies of (GAA·TTC)n repeats (where n = 9–150) were carried out using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase. When a gel-isolated sticky DNA template was transcribed, the amount of full-length RNA synthesized was significantly reduced compared with the transcription of the linear template. Surprisingly, transcriptional inhibition was observed not only for the sticky DNA template but also another DNA molecule used as an internal control in an orientation-independent manner. The molecular mechanism of transcriptional inhibition by sticky DNA was a sequestration of the RNA polymerases by direct binding to the complex DNA structure. Moreover, plasmids containing the (GAAGGA·TCCTTC)65 repeat, which does not form sticky DNA, did not inhibit in vitro transcription, as expected. These results suggest that the role of sticky DNA in FRDA may be the sequestration of transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2033221649,"Knowing the behavior of a fluid in small volumes is essential for the understanding of a vast array of common problems in science, such as biological interactions, fracture propagation, and molecular tribology and adhesion, as well as pressure solvation and other geophysical processes. When a fluid is confined, its phase behavior is altered and excluded-volume effects become apparent. Pioneering measurements performed with the surface forces apparatus have revealed so-called structural or oscillatory solvation forces as well as the occurrence of a finite shear stress, which was interpreted as a solidification transition. Here, we report measurements obtained with an extended surface forces apparatus, which makes use of fast spectral correlation to gain insight into the behavior of a thin film of cyclohexane confined within attoliter volumes, with simultaneous measurement of film thickness and refractive index. With decreasing pore width, cyclohexane is found to undergo a drastic transition from a three-dimensional bulk fluid to a two-dimensional adsorbate with strikingly different properties. Long-range density fluctuations of unexpected magnitude are observed."
https://openalex.org/W2021128909,"Midkine, a heparin-binding growth factor, plays a critical role in cell migration causing suppression of neointima formation in midkine-deficient mice. Here we have determined the molecules essential for midkine-induced migration. Midkine induced haptotaxis of osteoblast-like cells, which was abrogated by the soluble form of midkine or pleiotrophin, a midkine-homologous protein. Chondroitin sulfate B, E, chondroitinase ABC, B, and orthovanadate, an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatase, suppressed the migration. Supporting these data, the cells examined expressed PTPζ, a receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase that exhibits high affinity to both midkine and pleiotrophin and harbors chondroitin sulfate chains. Furthermore, strong synergism between midkine and platelet-derived growth factor in migration was detected. The use of specific inhibitors demonstrated that mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and protein-tyrosine phosphatase were involved in midkine-induced haptotaxis but not PDGF-induced chemotaxis, whereas phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase and protein kinase C were involved in both functions. Midkine activated both PI3-kinase and MAP kinases, the latter activation was blocked by a PI3-kinase inhibitor. Midkine further recruited PTPζ and PI3-kinase. These results indicate that PTPζ and concerted signaling involving PI3-kinase and MAP kinase are required for midkine-induced migration and demonstrate for the first time the synergism between midkine and platelet-derived growth factor in cell migration.

There are three main types of cell migration: chemokinesis, chemotaxis, and haptotaxis. Chemokinesis comprises random, non-directional motility in response to a ligand without any orienting cues. Chemotaxis is the cell movement toward a positive gradient of soluble stimulants such as chemokines and growth factors. Haptotaxis involves cell crawling toward substrate-bound molecules such as various extracellular matrix proteins. Cell migration is the result of a series of complicated, integrated processes and is controlled by many kinds of intracellular molecules (1Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F.

Res. 1999; 14: 1132-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Using MK knock-out mice, it was demonstrated that MK is involved in neointima formation in a model of restenosis after angioplasty (14Horiba M. Kadomatsu K. Nakamura E. Muramatsu H. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Hayashi K. Yuzawa Y. Matsuo S. Kuzuya M. Kaname T. Hirai M. Saito H. Muramatsu T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Neointima is the basic lesion in both atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty (15Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10004) Google Scholar). A variety of stresses to the arterial endothelium can induce the migration of smooth muscle cells from the media into the space between the endothelium and internal elastic lamina to form a neointima. One of the most important molecules in this process is PDGF-BB, which is responsible for the migration of smooth muscle cells (16Ferns G.A. Raines E.W. Sprugel K.H. Motani A.S. Reidy M.A. Ross R. Science. 1991; 253: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Macrophages recruited into the arterial wall also play a critical role in this lesion formation (17Boring L. Gosling J. Cleary M. Charo I.F. Nature. 1998; 394: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). Neointima formation and macrophage recruitment to the arterial wall were suppressed in MK-deficient mice (14Horiba M. Kadomatsu K. Nakamura E. Muramatsu H. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Hayashi K. Yuzawa Y. Matsuo S. Kuzuya M. Kaname T. Hirai M. Saito H. Muramatsu T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Because MK induces the migration of both smooth muscle cells and macrophages in vitro (14Horiba M. Kadomatsu K. Nakamura E. Muramatsu H. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Hayashi K. Yuzawa Y. Matsuo S. Kuzuya M. Kaname T. Hirai M. Saito H. Muramatsu T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), it was concluded that the cell migration-inducing activity of MK is crucial for the suppression of neointima formation. These findings also suggest a possible interaction between MK and PDGF in smooth muscle cell migration. In addition, remodeling after bone fractures also supports the interaction of MK and PDGF, because MK expression and PDGF accumulation are induced during this process (13Ohta S. Muramatsu H. Senda T. Zou K. Iwata H. Muramatsu T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1132-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PTN/HB-GAM promotes the migration of osteoblast-like cells, including UMR106 cells, which provides further evidence (18Imai S. Kaksonen M. Raulo E. Kinnunen T. Fages C. Meng X. Lakso M. Rauvala H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1113-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). MK and PTN/HB-GAM induce the migration of cortical neurons (19Maeda N. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 20Maeda N. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kimura T. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12474-12479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). MK also induces the migration of neutrophils (21Takada T. Toriyama K. Muramatsu H. Song X.-J. Torii S. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, only a limited body of information concerning the signaling involved in MK-mediated cell migration is available. We conducted the present study to elucidate the molecular components essential for MK-mediated cell migration, and to test our hypothesis that MK and PDGF could cooperate in cell migration. A rat osteoblast-like cell line, UMR106 (ATCC No. CRL 1661), was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Heparin, chondroitin sulfate A, C, D, and E, chondroitinase ABC, AC II, and B, and heparitinase were purchased from Seikagaku, Japan. Dermatan sulfate, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate were obtained from Sigma. The inhibitors for Src (PP1), protein kinase C (Ro318220), and a MAP kinase kinase, MEK (PD98059), were from Alexis Biochemicals, Calbiochem-Novabiochem and Biomol Research Laboratories, respectively. The other inhibitors for protein kinase C (H7 and calphostin C), PI3-kinase (wortmannin), and phospholipase C (U-73122) were products of Sigma. Recombinant human PDGF-BB was obtained from PeproTech, England. The procedure for producing recombinant human MK with yeast has already been described (14Horiba M. Kadomatsu K. Nakamura E. Muramatsu H. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Hayashi K. Yuzawa Y. Matsuo S. Kuzuya M. Kaname T. Hirai M. Saito H. Muramatsu T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and in this paper MK means human MK produced by yeast unless specified otherwise. Recombinant mouse MK was expressed with baculovirus and purified as described previously (9Kaneda N. Talukder A.H. Nishiyama H. Koizumi S. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Chemically synthesized human MK was purchased from the Peptide Institute, Japan. The procedure for producing recombinant human PTN/HB-GAM with yeast was the same as that for MK described previously (14Horiba M. Kadomatsu K. Nakamura E. Muramatsu H. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Hayashi K. Yuzawa Y. Matsuo S. Kuzuya M. Kaname T. Hirai M. Saito H. Muramatsu T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-PI3-kinase (p85α) antibody and anti-phospho-AKT-(Ser-473) antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology and Cell Signaling Technology, respectively. The rabbit anti-phosphorylated Erk antibody was from New England BioLabs. The monoclonal anti-Erk2 antibody and monoclonal anti-RPTPβ (PTPζ) antibody were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The rabbit polyclonal anti-PTPζ antibody (anti-6B4) was prepared as described previously (22Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Shintani T. Nishiwaki T. Noda M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The migration assay was performed as described previously (14Horiba M. Kadomatsu K. Nakamura E. Muramatsu H. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Hayashi K. Yuzawa Y. Matsuo S. Kuzuya M. Kaname T. Hirai M. Saito H. Muramatsu T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 19Maeda N. Noda M. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12474-12479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) using Chemotaxicell (Kurabo, Japan; 8-μm pores). PTPζ extraction and chondroitinase digestion were performed as described previously (23Nishiwaki T. Maeda N. Noda M. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Five μg of total RNA from 15-day-old rat brain or cultured cells was used for reverse-transcription with TrueScript (Sawady, Japan). The primers used for PCR were: 5′-GTTCTCAACACATCCCTGAATCCTACTTCCCA-3′ and 5′-CTTTAGTGATTCTTCTGAACCTGATGGAGCCGA-3′. The 474-bp PCR product corresponded to the 1587–2061 fragment of rat PTPζ (GenBankTM/EBI no. U09357), which was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Polystyrene beads (Polysciences) were coated with MK (20 μg/ml) or PLL (5 μg/ml, plus 15 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 4 °C overnight or room temperature for 2 h. The beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline four times before use. UMR106 cells starved for 24 h were stimulated with the coated polystyrene beads. Cells were lysed in a buffer comprising 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin, 40 nmleupeptin, and 0.2 mm sodium vanadate. Thirty μg of protein were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, followed by detection with anti-phosphorylated Erk, anti-Erk2, anti-phosphorylated AKT, or anti-AKT antibody. UMR106 cells were treated as described for Western blot analysis of Erk phosphorylation. PI3-kinase activity was measured by in vitro phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol, using essentially the same method as described previously (24Kim B.C. Lee M.N. Kim J.Y. Lee S.S. Chang J.D. Kim S.S. Lee S.Y. Kim J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24372-24377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). UMR106 cells, which had been exposed to MK- or PLL-beads for 15 min, were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then stained with anti-PI3-kinase (p85α) antibody/fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and/or anti-RPTPβ (PTPζ) monoclonal antibody/horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody/cyanine 5-labeled tyramide. For PTPζ staining, the TSA system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was employed to enhance the signal. PTN/HB-GAM, another member of the MK family, induces haptotactic migration of several osteoblast cell lines (18Imai S. Kaksonen M. Raulo E. Kinnunen T. Fages C. Meng X. Lakso M. Rauvala H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1113-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We first investigated whether or not MK had the same activity. When coated on the lower surface of a filter, MK induced the haptotactic migration of UMR106 cells, with the maximum level at the concentration of 20 μg/ml (Fig. 1 A). The profile of MK-induced cell migration was similar to that of the colon carcinoma cell migration induced by several extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin-1, and collagen IV (25Rigot V. Lehmann M. Andre F. Daemi N. Marvaldi J. Luis J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As chemically synthesized human MK and baculovirus-produced mouse MK showed the same activity as that of yeast-produced human MK (Fig.1 B), the migratory effect was not caused by impurities in the MK used. MK contains 30% basic amino acids. However, PLL showed very weak migratory activity (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the effect of MK was not because of its high basicity. Soluble MK did not induce UMR106 cell migration (Fig. 1 B), even if the filter was precoated with collagen I (data not shown). On the contrary, when added to the lower chamber, soluble MK inhibited coated MK-induced migration (Fig. 1 C). At the concentration of 10 μg/ml, soluble MK completely abolished coated MK-induced migration. The same concentration of soluble PLL in the lower chamber did not inhibit MK-induced migration (data not shown). These findings indicate that the substratum-bound form of MK is active in cell migration. Thus, MK could induce haptotactic, but not chemotactic, migration of UMR106 cells. We next addressed the question of whether or not MK and PTN/HB-GAM share the same cell surface binding site(s). Soluble MK abrogated PTN/HB-GAM-induced haptotaxis and vice versa (Fig.2 A). Coating with a combination of MK and PTN/HB-GAM did not enhance the migration as compared with MK or PTN/HB-GAM alone (Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that if the total molar concentration of MK and PTN/HB-GAM reaches a critical level, the migration activity will be saturated, and MK and PTN/HB-GAM may function through common molecule(s) on the cell surface. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans, such as syndecan-1, -3, and -4, and a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, PTPζ, are supposed to act as a receptor or co-receptor for MK (20Maeda N. Ichihara-Tanaka K.

Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 197-205PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the effects of different glycosaminoglycans on MK-mediated migration. In addition to heparin, dermatan sulfate (chondroitin sulfate B) and chondroitin sulfate E showed comparable effects. They abolished the migration at the concentration of 20 μg/ml (Fig.3 A). At 20 μg/ml, chondroitin sulfate A, C, and D showed only minor effects (Fig.3 A). Treatment with heparitinase to remove the heparan sulfate on the cell surface did not affect MK-mediated migration (Fig.3 B). On the contrary, chondroitinase ABC digestion and chondroitinase B digestion down-regulated MK-mediated migration (Fig.3, C and D), suggesting the involvement of cell surface chondroitin sulfate. As PTPζ exhibits high affinity to both MK and PTN/HB-GAM (20Maeda N. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kimura T. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12474-12479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 29Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), the results shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 3 suggest that PTPζ is involved in MK-induced haptotaxis. Using RT-PCR, a band corresponding to PTPζ was detected for UMR106 cells and rat brain (Fig.4 A). The PCR product was confirmed by DNA sequencing (data not shown). No positive band was detected for L cells or Wilms' tumor cells (Fig. 4 A). This is consistent with the observation that coated MK did not induce the migration of these cells with a 4-h incubation (data not shown). On Western blotting with monoclonal anti-RPTPβ (PTPζ) antibody, which recognizes the intracellular domain of PTPζ, a smear was detected for the lysate of UMR106 cells (Fig. 4 B, bracket,lane 3). This changed to one band corresponding to about 240 kDa after chondroitinase ABC digestion (Fig. 4 B, lane 4, arrow). For rat brain, smears were also detected (Fig. 4 B, lane 1), which shifted to 380 and 220 kDa upon digestion with chondroitinase ABC (Fig. 4 B,lane 2, arrowheads), which represent long- and short-type receptors, respectively (23Nishiwaki T. Maeda N. Noda M. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The size difference around 220/240 kDa between the brain and UMR106 cells is probably caused by differential glycosylation, which is dependent on the cell type (30Yahiro K. Niidome T. Kimura M. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Kurazono H. Imagawa K. Wada A. Moss J. Hirayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36693-36699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Chondroitinase AC II and B appeared to digest the glycosaminoglycan chains of PTPζ only partially, because the band around 240 kDa was broader than the band digested with chondroitinase ABC (Fig.4 B, lanes 8, 9, 10). This is reasonable because chondroitinase AC II and B recognize different structures (31Hiyama K. Okada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1824-1828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Michelacci Y.M. Dietrich C.P. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, only chondroitinase ABC and B, but not AC II, suppressed MK-induced migration (Fig. 3 D), suggesting that structures susceptible to chondroitinase ABC and B are important. As chondroitinase B can digest both dermatan sulfate and E-type dermatan sulfate (32Michelacci Y.M. Dietrich C.P. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and chondroitinase ABC can digest all chondroitin and dermatan sulfates (33Saito H. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1536-1542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this is consistent with the finding that MK-induced cell migration was inhibited by dermatan sulfate (chondroitin sulfate B) and chondroitin sulfate E (Fig.3 A). PTPζ is also known to be a receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase. The effect of orthovanadate, an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatase, was examined. Sodium vanadate decreased the migration in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 C). Sodium vanadate had no effect on PLL or PDGF-BB-induced migration of UMR106 cells (data not shown). If the cells were preincubated with anti-PTPζ (anti-6B4) antibodies, which recognize the ectodomain of the full-length PTPζ (23Nishiwaki T. Maeda N. Noda M. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), MK-mediated cell migration was enhanced (Fig. 4 D). This suggests that ligation of cell surface PTPζ with its ligands or antibodies may transduce signals essential for the migration of UMR106 cells. To identify the intracellular molecules that participate in MK-mediated cell migration, various specific inhibitors were screened. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein and herbimycin A), a Src inhibitor (PP1), protein kinase C inhibitors (H7, Ro318220, and calphostin C), a PI3-kinase inhibitor (wortmannin), a MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor (PD98059), and a phospholipase C inhibitor (U-73122) effectively inhibited MK-mediated cell migration (Fig. 5). This probably indicates that a dynamically concerted signaling interaction is essential for the cell migration induced by MK. When UMR106 cells were stimulated with MK-coated polystrene beads, a transient increase in phosphorylation of MAP kinases (Erk1 and Erk2) was detected, the maximum level being observed ∼20 min after stimulation (Fig. 6 A). At 60 min, it was still higher than the basal level (Fig. 6 A). PLL also enhanced Erk phosphorylation, but the increase was less and the duration was shorter than in the case of MK (Fig. 6 A). Interestingly, the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin partly blocked MK-induced Erk phosphorylation, whereas the protein kinase C inhibitor Ro318220 did not (Fig. 6 B). MK also increased PI3-kinase activity, the profile being similar to that in the case of PDGF-BB (Fig. 7 A). Neither Ro318220 nor MEK inhibitor PD98059 affected MK-induced PI3-kinase activation (Fig. 7 B).Figure 7PI3-kinase activity after MK and PDGF-BB stimulation. UMR106 cells were stimulated with PDGF-BB, or polystyrene beads coated with PLL or MK. PI 3-kinase activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”A, representative autoradiography. Lower panel, quantitative presentation (mean ± S.E.; n = 3).B, effects of inhibitors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further confirm MK-induced PI3-kinase activation, phosphorylation of AKT was examined. AKT (protein kinase B) plays important roles in many biological phenomena, such as cell survival (34Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar, 35Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). AKT contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and is phosphorylated (activated) at Thr-308 and Ser-473 residues by PDK1, which also carries a PH domain. The PH domain recognizes a phosphoinositide headgroup, and phosphorylation at the 3 position of inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol in the cell membrane is critical for AKT- and PDK1-binding and recruitment to the cell membrane (35Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). As this phosphorylation is mediated by PI3-kinase, AKT is an important PI3-kinase effector, and its activation is often used as a marker of PI3-kinase activation (34Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar, 35Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). MK enhanced AKT phosphorylation (Fig.8 A, left), which is consistent with the data for MK-induced PI3-kinase activation shown in Fig. 7 A. When the cells were preincubated with anti-PTPζ (anti-6B4) antibodies, MK-induced AKT activation was stronger than that of the cells treated with control IgG (Fig. 8 A, right). This was consistent with that anti-PTPζ (anti-6B4) antibodies enhanced MK-induced migration of UMR106 cells (Fig.4 D). It is of interest that, in addition to the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate and Src inhibitor PP1 blocked MK-induced AKT activation (Fig. 8 A, right), but neither protein kinase C inhibitor Ro 318220 nor MEK inhibitor PD98059 affected it (data not shown). As the effect of orthovanadate on MK-induced AKT phosphorylation suggested the possibility of a close connection between PTPζ and PI3-kinase, we localized PTPζ and PI 3-kinase after MK beads stimulation on UMR106 cells. MK beads induced PI3-kinase recruitment to the sites of the beads (Fig. 8 B, left two panels). Furthermore, MK-beads induced colocalization of PI3-kinase and PTPζ (Fig. 8 B, lower two panels). The hypothesis that MK and PDGF can cooperate in cell migration in some in vivo situations was examined next. On filters coated on both their upper and lower surfaces with collagen I, PDGF-BB induced chemotactic migration of UMR106 cells (Fig.9 A). PDGF-induced migration was suppressed by Ro318220 and wortmannin (Fig. 9 A). But PD98059, which inhibited MK-mediated cell migration (Fig. 5), did not affect PDGF-mediated migration (Fig. 9 A). Whereas heparin abolished MK-mediated cell migration (Fig. 3 A), it rather enhanced PDGF-mediated cell migration (Fig. 9 A). If the lower surface of the filters was coated with MK instead of collagen I, the chemotactic activity of PDGF-BB was dramatically enhanced (Fig.9 B). The effects of MK and PDGF-BB were synergistic, because the migrated cell number was much higher than the total when MK and PDGF-BB were used separately. The migration induced by the combination of MK and PDGF-BB was susceptible to inhibitors of PI 3-kinase and protein kinase C, but not to the MEK inhibitor (Fig. 9 C). This profile resembles that of the migration induced by PDGF-BB alone, but not that in the case of MK alone. MK has been reported to be induced in areas of a variety of types of tissue injury, such as cerebral and heart infarction, bone fractures, skin burns, and arterial endothelial injury (12Yoshida Y.

https://openalex.org/W2037273540,"DNA damage activates cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathways that coordinate cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. Three of the proteins involved in checkpoint signaling, Rad1, Hus1, and Rad9, have been shown to interact by immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid studies. However, it is not known how these proteins interact and assemble into a complex. In the present study we demonstrated that in human cells all the hRad9 and hHus1 and approximately one-half of the cellular pool of hRad1 interacted as a stable, biochemically discrete complex, with an apparent molecular mass of 160 kDa. This complex was reconstituted by co-expression of all three recombinant proteins in a heterologous system, and the reconstituted complex exhibited identical chromatographic behavior as the endogenous complex. Interaction studies using differentially tagged proteins demonstrated that the proteins did not self-multimerize. Rather, each protein had a binding site for the other two partners, with the N terminus of hRad9 interacting with hRad1, the N terminus of hRad1 interacting with hHus1, and the N terminus of hHus1 interacting with the C terminus of hRad9's predicted PCNA-like region. Collectively, these analyses suggest a model of how these three proteins assemble to form a functional checkpoint complex, which we dubbed the 9-1-1 complex. DNA damage activates cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathways that coordinate cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. Three of the proteins involved in checkpoint signaling, Rad1, Hus1, and Rad9, have been shown to interact by immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid studies. However, it is not known how these proteins interact and assemble into a complex. In the present study we demonstrated that in human cells all the hRad9 and hHus1 and approximately one-half of the cellular pool of hRad1 interacted as a stable, biochemically discrete complex, with an apparent molecular mass of 160 kDa. This complex was reconstituted by co-expression of all three recombinant proteins in a heterologous system, and the reconstituted complex exhibited identical chromatographic behavior as the endogenous complex. Interaction studies using differentially tagged proteins demonstrated that the proteins did not self-multimerize. Rather, each protein had a binding site for the other two partners, with the N terminus of hRad9 interacting with hRad1, the N terminus of hRad1 interacting with hHus1, and the N terminus of hHus1 interacting with the C terminus of hRad9's predicted PCNA-like region. Collectively, these analyses suggest a model of how these three proteins assemble to form a functional checkpoint complex, which we dubbed the 9-1-1 complex. proliferating cell nuclear antigen RFC, replication factor C hemagglutinin polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis green fluorescent protein DNA damage provokes multiple cellular responses, including the activation of DNA damage checkpoint signaling pathways, which arrest cell cycle progression in G1, S, and G2/M and possibly coordinate repair of the damage.

Collectively, these studies have given rise to a conserved model in which DNA damage activates members of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated) family of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases. These protein kinases are then required to activate the downstream protein kinases Chk1 and Chk2 (20Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Schwarz J.K. Mitiki N. Piwnica-Worms H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Toczyski D.P. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 315-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 3Weinert T.

Carr A.M. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1999; 81: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, in S. pombe spRad1, spHus1, spRad9, and spRad17 (usingS. pombe nomenclature) are all essential for DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest and activation of the spChk1 protein kinase after DNA damage (4Longhese M.P. Foiani M. Muzi-Falconi M. Lucchini G. Plevani P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5525-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 5Lowndes N.F. Murguia J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Thus, these results suggest that Rad1, Hus1, Rad9, and Rad17 function upstream of Chk1 activation in the DNA damage-signaling pathway.Recently, molecular modeling studies were used to propose functions for Rad1, Hus1, Rad9, and Rad17 (26Venclovas C. Thelen M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2481-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 27Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27909-27916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this model Rad9, Hus1, and Rad1 form a PCNA1 like clamp. PCNA is homotrimeric doughnut-shaped structure that is loaded onto DNA by the clamp loader, replication factor C (RFC) (29Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 30Mossi R. Hubscher U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). Once loaded, PCNA encircles the DNA as a sliding clamp, tethering replication proteins, including DNA polymerase δ, to the replicating DNA. RFC is composed of four small subunits (p36, p37, p38, and p40) and one large subunit (p140), and all the subunits contain consensus nucleotide-binding Walker A and B motifs (31Cullmann G. Fien K. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). RFC binds to primer-template junctions that are generated during replication, opens the PCNA clamp, and loads the clamp around the DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. Thus, the molecular modeling studies suggest that Rad9, Hus1, Rad1, and Rad17 may have functions analogous to the functions of PCNA and RFC.In addition to the molecular modeling predictions, limited biochemical data also support this model. First, the S. cerevisiaehomolog of hRad17 interacts with the four small subunits of RFC in a stable complex, suggesting that the Rad17-RFC complex may indeed be a clamp loader (32Green C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Lowndes N.F. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 39-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, no data currently support this contention. Second, yeast and mammalian Rad9, Hus1, and Rad1 interact in immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid analyses (27Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 74: 1254-1262Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 33St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M. Casselman R. Davey S. Mol. Biol.

However, the nature of the complex has not been explored. Third, hRad1, hHus1, and hRad9 interact with hRad17 in a manner that requires an intact hRad17 ATP-binding domain (36Rauen M. Burtelow M.A. Dufault V.M. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29767-29771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fourth, following DNA damage, the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 complex is converted to an extraction-resistant, chromatin-bound complex, which may reflect clamping of the complex onto sites of damage (37Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations suggest a model in which the Rad17-RFC clamp loader recognizes DNA damage and then loads a Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 clamp around the DNA. Once loaded around DNA, the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 complex may tether signaling and repair molecules to the damaged site.Despite the data supporting the clamp model, there are several experimental inconsistencies with the model. First, studies in S. pombe demonstrated that spHus1 and spRad1 could not interact in the absence of spRad9 (10Kostrub C.F. Knudsen K. Subramani S. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2055-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 74: 1254-1262Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar), which suggested that spRad9 linked the two proteins. In contrast, the clamp model predicts that spHus1 and spRad1 should interact even in the absence of spRad9. Second, additional studies in S. pombe indicated that spRad9, spHus1, and spRad1 interacted at very low stoichiometry, calling into question whether these proteins do indeed form a stable clamp (27Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 74: 1254-1262Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Third, there are phenotypic differences between sprad1 andsphus1 null mutants, which would be unexpected if the two proteins formed a portion of the clamp (38Dahlen M. Olsson T. Kanter-Smoler G. Ramne A. Sunnerhagen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To address these questions with the mammalian proteins and to characterize further the biochemical nature of hRad9, hHus1, and hRad1 complex, we examined the complex in human cell lysates using size-exclusion chromatography. We also reconstituted the complex in an insect expression system and mapped the interaction domains among the three proteins. These studies revealed that hRad9, hHus1, and hRad1 form a stable protein complex, which we dubbed the 9-1-1 complex. Our data, which are consistent with a circular head-to-tail organization for the three-member complex, also support the proposed sliding clamp model. Additionally, these studies identified a pool of monomeric hRad1, which may have functions separate from the 9-1-1 complex.DISCUSSIONStudies in the yeast S. pombe demonstrated that Rad1, Hus1, and Rad9 are required for early events in the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint-signaling pathway. Initially, there were few clues regarding their functions, although the proteins had been shown to interact. To further our understanding of how hRad1, hHus1, and hRad9 interact to form a checkpoint complex, we examined the endogenous complex, reconstituted the complex in a heterologous expression system, and mapped interactions among the subunits. In this report we show that the majority of human hRad9, hHus1, and hRad1 exist in a heterotrimeric complex. We also found that the PCNA-like portions of hHus1 (full-length), hRad1 (full-length), and hRad9 (amino acids 1–270) do not self-multimerize. Additionally, we reconstituted the 9-1-1 complex in an insect cell expression system and demonstrated that it had identical chromatographic behavior. Finally, our mapping studies demonstrated that each member of the complex interacted in a pair-wise fashion, and these studies also mapped the interactions among the three 9-1-1 complex members. Collectively, these results provide novel insights into the assembly, structure, and potential functions of the 9-1-1 DNA damage-responsive checkpoint complex.The self-oligomerization analysis suggests that hRad9, hHus1, and hRad1 do not homomultimerize. This is in contrast to a study by Hang and Lieberman (35Hang H. Lieberman H.B. Genomics. 2000; 65: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which demonstrated that hHus1 and hRad9 self-oligomerize. One possible explanation for this discrepancy stems from our observation that full-length hRad9 forms large, higher-order aggregates when overexpressed without its partners hRad1 and hHus1. 2M. A. Burtelow and L. M. Karnitz, unpublished data. These higher-order aggregates may be physiologically relevant. However, analysis of endogenous hRad9, hHus1, and hRad1 (Fig. 1) did not reveal such complexes. Thus, we propose that hRad9, hHus1, and hRad1 form a heterotrimeric 9-1-1 complex that does not include self-multimers of any individual component.Examination of the interactions within the 9-1-1 complex revealed that each member interacted in a pair-wise manner. We also mapped the pair-wise interactions using amino- and carboxyl-terminal expression constructs. These results showed that: 1) the amino terminus of hRad9 interacted selectively with hRad1, 2) the amino terminus of hRad1 interacted with hHus1, and 3) the amino terminus of hHus1 interacted with hRad9. Further mapping, using the carboxyl terminus of the hRad9 predicted PCNA fold, demonstrated that this region associated with the amino terminus of hHus1. Thus, the PCNA-like portion of hRad9 is flanked by hRad1 on its amino terminus and by hHus1 on its carboxyl terminus. Although we were unable to fully map the interactions among the subunits, our studies support a PCNA-like clamp model (Fig.8) and define the orientation of the three proteins in the complex. It is important to bear in mind, however, that confirmation of the structure awaits biophysical analysis of purified 9-1-1 complex.Studies in S. pombe demonstrated that Myc-tagged spHus1 eluted as a complex with an apparent molecular mass of 450 kDa (27Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 74: 1254-1262Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Moreover, only very small fractions of the total spRad9 and spRad1 pools were associated with the tagged spHus1. These results suggest that either the complex is very unstable or that the proteins do not form a clamp-like structure. In contrast, we found that all the hHus1 and hRad9, and about one-half of the hRad1 were assembled into a stable, discrete complex in human cell lysates, indicating that the complex was the favored form in cell lysates and presumably in intact cells. Such results suggest that the complexes may vary significantly between yeast and mammals. Alternatively, the addition of 13 Myc tags to spHus1, even though the tagged protein complemented asphus1 null mutant, may dramatically affect the stability of protein-protein interactions with spHus1.The present studies also differ from the studies in yeast with respect to interactions between individual complex members. Two studies have shown that S. pombe spHus1 and spRad1 do not co-immunoprecipitate in the absence of spRad9 (6Caspari T. Carr A.M. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1999; 81: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Kostrub C.F. Knudsen K. Subramani S. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2055-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), suggesting that spRad9 links spRad1 and spHus1. This result differs from our data and is difficult to reconcile with the clamp model. We found that each protein interacted efficiently in pair-wise reconstitution experiments, which is consistent with a clamp model. The reasons for the discrepancies between the yeast and human studies are not known. The two organisms may differentially regulate complex assembly. Alternatively, the discrepancy may stem from dissimilar technical approaches used to study yeast and mammalian cells. For example, the harsher conditions required to disrupt yeast cells may also destabilize the interactions among the 9-1-1 complex members, especially if one complex member is missing as is the case in the studies with the spRad9 mutant.The results presented here may also provide insight into a disparity between the clamp model and genetic studies in S. pombe. Although the PCNA-like clamp model for the 9-1-1 complex is compelling, it does not account for all the available data. A previous analysis of telomere maintenance in S. pombe revealed thatsprad1 null mutants had telomere-shortening defects, whereassphus1 null and sprad9–192 (null for all tested phenotypes) mutants had normal telomeric lengths (38Dahlen M. Olsson T. Kanter-Smoler G. Ramne A. Sunnerhagen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These observations are not compatible with a clamp composed of three different subunits; if any one subunit were missing, the clamp would no longer be able to encircle DNA. Thus, null mutants of sprad1 and sphus1 should have identical phenotypes. A possible explanation for this discordance is that the functions of these proteins may have diverged. Evidence for this possibility includes the observation that cells derived from mHus1 knockout mice are sensitive to ultraviolet but not ionizing radiation (40Weiss R.S. Enoch T. Leder P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1886-1898PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast,sphus1 null S. pombe are sensitive to both forms of radiation, suggesting that mammals may have evolved additional mechanisms to respond to DNA damage. An alternative explanation is that the monomeric hRad1 that we observed in human cell lysates might have functions independent of a 9-1-1 clamp. For instance, spRad1 and the related Ustilago maydis Rec1 checkpoint protein possess 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (11Parker A.E. Van de Weyer I. Laus M.C. Oostveen I. Yon J. Verhasselt P. Luyten W.H.M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18332-18339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 41Thelen M.P. Onel K. Holloman W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 747-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, hRad1 may have dual biochemical functions; in a complex with hRad9 and hHus1 it might be part of a clamp, and as a monomer it may operate as an exonuclease.On the basis of the genetic, biochemical, and structural prediction data available for Rad9, Hus1, Rad1, and Rad17, the following model has arisen. Rad17, in complex with the small RFC subunits, may recognize directly or indirectly DNA damage. The Rad17-RFC clamp loader will then open and load the 9-1-1 clamp onto the DNA. Once loaded, the 9-1-1 clamp becomes resistant to extraction, and by analogy with PCNA, tethers proteins to sites of DNA damage. Once clamped onto the DNA, the function of the 9-1-1 clamp may be to “mark” DNA lesions, thereby recruiting repair machinery and downstream signaling components that activate the checkpoint signal. The studies presented here provide compelling evidence that hRad9, hHus1, and hRad1 form a clamp-like structure, providing further impetus to test the predicted clamp model. DNA damage provokes multiple cellular responses, including the activation of DNA damage checkpoint signaling pathways, which arrest cell cycle progression in G1, S, and G2/M and possibly coordinate repair of the damage. Loss of the DNA damage checkpoint response leads to increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, demonstrating that these pathways are critical for efficient recovery from DNA damage (reviewed in Refs. 1Dasika G.K.

Hypoxia, the decrease in oxygen supply to tissues, determines a series of metabolic and systemic adaptations that tend to overcome the detrimental effect of the lack of oxygen. Central to this adaptation is the regulation of hypoxia-responsive genes that control multiple cellular and systemic functions (reviewed in Ref. 1Wenger R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of these genes are regulated by a common mechanism of transcriptional activation that involves the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)1 complex (2Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4995) Google Scholar). The HIF-1 complex is composed of two subunits. HIF-1α and HIF-1β, members of the helix loop helix-PAS family of transcription factors. The function of the HIF-1 complex is primarily regulated by the abundance of the HIF-1α subunit. Although HIF-1β is constitutively expressed in normoxic cells, the HIF-1α subunit is only detectable in hypoxic cells. Under normoxic conditions, the HIF-1α protein is ubiquitinated and rapidly degraded by the proteasomal system (3Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar, 4Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). The ubiquitination process depends on its interaction with the von Hippel Lindau protein (VHL) that acts as a ubiquitin protein ligase (5Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). Hypoxia, transition metals, and iron chelators inhibit this degradation process and allow for HIF-1α accumulation and formation of the transcriptionally active complex. Significantly, HIF-1α responses are very rapid and occur at levels of hypoxia that are well within the physiological range (8Jiang B.-H. Semenza G.L. Bauer C. Marti H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1172-C1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the induction of HIF-1α during hypoxia is practically instantaneous, with protein HIF-1α detected in the nucleus as early as 2 min after exposure to low oxygen (9Jewell U.R. Kvietikova I. Scheid A. Bauer C. Wenger R.H. Gassman M. FASEB. 2001; 15: 1312-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Despite the advances in the area of gene regulation by hypoxia, the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for oxygen sensing and the downstream pathways utilized by the hypoxic signal are still poorly understood. In biological systems, oxygen reactivity is usually associated with metals, most notably iron, as it intervenes in two types of reactions in the following ways: (a) as an acceptor of electrons in redox reactions, or (b) in liganding to heme groups. In the latter case, as it happens in its interactions with hemoglobin, there is no transfer of electrons. This last property suggested to Goldberg et al. (10Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) that oxygen sensing in vertebrates may utilize a rapidly turning over heme-containing protein, such that oxygen-dependent changes in conformation would initiate the hypoxia response. However, inhibitors of heme synthesis had no significant affect on hypoxia response (11Srinivas V. Zhu X. Salceda S. Nakamura R. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (.; correction 274, 1180, 1999): 18019-18022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Horiguchi H. Bunn H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Other models for oxygen sensing are based on electron transfer or redox reactions. In redox reactions, oxygen acts as the acceptor of electrons and may result in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Based on the stimulatory effect of iron chelators on HIF-1α activation, Srinivas et al. (11Srinivas V. Zhu X. Salceda S. Nakamura R. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (.; correction 274, 1180, 1999): 18019-18022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) proposed that iron may be interacting directly, or through an intermediate iron-binding protein, with HIF-1α by inducing localized oxidative reactions that would act as a signal for degradation. However, no such protein has yet been found (11Srinivas V. Zhu X. Salceda S. Nakamura R. Caro J. J. Biol.

J. 1994; 303: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) have postulated that a low output NADPH oxidase, similar to the one present in neutrophils, could act as an oxygen sensor. In this model, hydrogen peroxide would be continuously generated by the oxidase in an oxygen-dependent manner and would have a continuous negative tonic effect on HIF-1α survival. During hypoxia, the decrease in peroxide production would result in HIF-lα accumulation. However, evidence against this model is the finding that diphenylene iodonium (DPI), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, decreases rather than stimulates the hypoxia response (15Gleadle J.M. Ebert B.L. Ratcliffe P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Chandel et al. (16Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar) have proposed another redox model of oxygen sensing based on the production of ROS by the mitochondria. These investigators have reported that during hypoxia there is an increase in superoxide production at the level of complex III of the respiratory electron transfer chain. The increase in ROS production would be proportional to the degree of hypoxia and would be, following dismutation to hydrogen peroxide, the starting point of the hypoxic signal. Experimental support for their model is the unresponsiveness to hypoxia of cells lacking mitochondrial DNA, ρo cells. Furthermore, blocking of electron transfer at complex I by rotenone resulted in inhibition of the hypoxia response. However, other studies had found that inhibitors of cytochrome c oxidase, like cyanide and azide, had no effect on the hypoxia response and suggested that the mitochondria was not involved in oxygen sensing. The results by Chandelet al. (16Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar) prompted us to re-evaluate the role of mitochondria in HIF-1α activation. Our results indicate that the integrity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is not necessary for hypoxia response. Furthermore, they show that hydrogen peroxide is not an intermediary molecule involved in oxygen sensing. HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in high glucose DMEM (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin.

Mitochondrial DNA-less (ρo cells) were prepared by prolonged exposure to ethidium bromide as described by King and Attardi (18King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 304-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% or 15% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, sodium pyruvate (1 mm), and uridine (50 μg/ml). Cells were maintained at saturation humidity at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. For hypoxic stimulation, the cultures were flushed in a modular incubator (Billups-Rothenburg, Del Mar, CA) with a gas mixture of 0.5% O2, 5% CO2, and nitrogen was balanced. Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (19Srinivas V. Zhang L.-P. Zhu X.-H. Caro J. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commnun. 1999; 260: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Expression vectors used in the functional Luciferase assays have been described previously (19Srinivas V. Zhang L.-P. Zhu X.-H. Caro J. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commnun. 1999; 260: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from normal or treated cells as described previously (19Srinivas V. Zhang L.-P. Zhu X.-H. Caro J. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commnun. 1999; 260: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed by incubating 10 μg of nuclear extract with32P-labeled double stranded oligonucleotide probe from the human HIF-1 Epo enhancer as described (4Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, equal amounts of nuclear extracts (10–20 μg of protein) were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes prior to detection using a stabilized alkaline phosphatase system (Promega, Madison, WI) (19Srinivas V. Zhang L.-P. Zhu X.-H. Caro J. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commnun. 1999; 260: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody was purchased from Southern Biotechnology (Birmingham, AL). Cells growing on glass slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 8.0) for 10 min and then washed with PBS three times. Subsequently, they were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and rinsed again three times with PBS. After blocking nonspecific binding with 10% fetal calf serum in PBS for 30 min, the cells were incubated with a monoclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO). Primary antibody was detected by incubation with an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) at room temperature for 30 min. Following extensive washing in PBS and mounting in Miowol solution (Calbiochem), the cells were visualized and photographed utilizing a fluorescence microscope (Nikon). Total RNA was isolated with the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNase protection assays was performed utilizing a 32P-labeled single stranded vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) probe as described previously (20Minchenko A. Bauer T. Salceda S. Caro J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 374-379PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria are the center of oxidative phosphorylation, a process by which ATP is formed as a result of the transfer of electrons from NADH or FADH2 to O2 by a series of electron carriers. The mammalian mitochondrial DNA encodes thirteen proteins, all subunits of the respiratory chain enzymes, including critical catalytic subunits for complex I (NADH dehydrogenase), complex III (bcl complex), complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), and ATP synthetase. Elimination of mitochondrial DNA from cells by prolonged ethidium bromide treatment results in the absence of respiratory chain electron transfer and mitochondrial ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation (18King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 304-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells lacking mitochondrial DNA can survive, however, when provided with external sources of pyrimidines and pyruvate (18King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 304-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We utilized two independently generated ρo cell lines, one derived from the human osteosarcoma cells (143B206) (18King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 304-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and one from a human fibroblast cell line (GM 701) (21Jacobson M.D. Burne J.F. King M.P. Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Raff M.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The ρo cells and the corresponding parental cell lines were subjected to hypoxia (0.5% O2) for 4–6 h, and the nuclear extracts were analyzed for HIF-1α expression by Western blots and for HIF-1 complex formation by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. As shown in Fig. 1,a and b, exposure to hypoxia and desferrioxamine results in increased expression of HIF-1α protein in both ρo cell lines, their parental wild types, and HeLa cells. Similarly, hypoxia, desferrioxamine, and cobalt induced the formation of the HIF-1 DNA binding complexes, as measured by gel shift assays (Fig. 1 c). Furthermore, rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, had no effect on the hypoxia responses (not shown). The activation of HIF-1α expression by hypoxia in ρocells was confirmed by immunofluorescence and functional studies. Fig.2 a shows the induction of nuclear fluorescence, detected with an anti-HIF-1α monoclonal antibody, in parental 143B (wild type) and ρo 143B206 cells exposed to hypoxia (2 and 5) or treated with desferrioxamine (3 and 6). To test whether the transcriptional activation of HIF-1α by hypoxia was conserved in ρo cells, we utilized an expression vector containing the transcriptionally active C-terminal domain of HIF-1α protein (amino acids 740 to 826) fused to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transactivator GAL-4 (19Srinivas V. Zhang L.-P. Zhu X.-H. Caro J. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commnun. 1999; 260: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of this plasmid with a luciferase reporter containing a GAL-4 DNA-binding site showed that hypoxia induced the transactivational activity of HIF-1α, both in ρo and wild type cells (Fig. 2 b). Furthermore, confirmation of the hypoxia responsiveness of ρo cells was obtained by the hypoxic activation of the VEGF gene as shown in the RNase protection assay in Fig. 2 c. Most of the currently proposed redox models for oxygen sensing suggest that H2O2 is the intermediary signal molecule in the hypoxia response. To evaluate the role of hydrogen peroxide in oxygen sensing, we utilized cell lines that overexpress the enzyme catalase in either the mitochondrial or cytosolic compartments. These cell lines were produced by introducing a catalase cDNA or a catalase cDNA with a superoxide dismutase mitochondrial leader sequence into a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2 cells). Published results (17Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) have shown that these cell lines are more resistant to H2O2-, menadione-, or antimycin A-induced apoptosis as compared with cells transfected with the vector alone. After exposure to hypoxia and desferrioxamine of control and catalase-overexpressing cells, the induction of HIF-1α was measured by Western blots and electrophoretic motility shift assays. Fig. 3 a shows that overexpression of catalase, either in the cytosol (C33 cells) or in the mitochondria (Mc5 cells), does not affect the response to hypoxia or change the basal expression of HIF-1α protein. Similar results were obtained using the gel shift assay (not shown). The effect of catalase overexpression on the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α was evaluated by using the GAL-4-HIF-1α fusion system, as described above. Fig. 3 b indicates that overexpression of catalase does not affect the transcriptional response to hypoxia (Fig.3 d). Early work showing that cyanide and sodium azide do not affect the hypoxia response suggested that the mitochondrial respiratory chain was not involved in oxygen sensing (22Necas E. Thorling E.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1972; 222: 1187-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, Chandel et al.(16Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar) have proposed that an increase in superoxide production at the level of mitochondrial complex III (quinol-cytochrome coxidoreductase) is the initial event that triggers the hypoxia response (16Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). Superoxide is produced during normal mitochondrial function, and it is rapidly converted to H2O2, a readily diffusible molecule (23Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). A compelling argument for their hypothesis was the finding that ρo cells, which lack mitochondrial DNA, have an impaired response to hypoxia. In the work presented here, we have utilized two independent human ρo cell lines created by prolonged exposure to low doses of ethidium bromide. This treatment results in inhibition of mitochondrial DNA replication without affecting the nuclear DNA (18King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 304-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As mitochondrial DNA encodes essential subunits of the respiratory chain and ATP synthetase, ρo cells have no mitochondrial electron transfer and are completely dependent on glycolysis for the generation of ATP. Furthermore, these cells depend on exogenous sources of pyrimidines (pyrimidine auxotrophy). The need for pyrimidine is explained by the fact that the enzyme dihydrooratate dehydrogenase is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and requires mitochondrial electron transfer for normal function. In the presence of pyruvate and pyrimidines, these cell lines can maintain almost normal cell growth rates. One of the cell lines (143B206) was derived from an osteosarcoma cell line and the other (701–2c) from an SV-40 T-antigen-transformed fibroblast cell line (18King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 304-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jacobson M.D. Burne J.F. King M.P. Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Raff M.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption in the ρo cells was found to be less than 5% of the control cells, and no cytochrome c oxidase activity was detected (24King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). The ρo status of both cell lines was confirmed by their inability to grow in pyruvate- and pyrimidine-deficient media and by DNA hybridization studies showing no traces of mitochondrial DNA. Our results with the ρo cells indicate that an active mitochondrial respiratory electron transport chain is not an absolute requirement for the activation of HIF-1 protein in response to hypoxia. Furthermore, we find that in both cell lines the functional activity of the HIF-1 complex, its nuclear translocation, and its hypoxia-induced transactivation activity are preserved, as well. The differences between our results and those of Chandel et al. (16Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar) are unclear and may derive from differences in the cell lines or the procedures used to establish the ρo cells. It should be noted that in the preparation of ρo cells, Chandelet al. (16Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol.

It is not known whether this selection step may affect the properties of the cells. Electron transfer reactions (redox reactions) appear to be an important component of the mechanisms of oxygen sensing. Acker (13Acker H. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

J. 1994; 303: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) have postulated that a low output NADPH oxidase, similar to the one present in granulocytes, may initiate the hypoxic response. In their model, the continuous production of superoxide by this NADPH oxidase would act as an active negative signal to induce HIF-1α degradation. During hypoxia, the decrease in hydrogen peroxide would result in increased HIF-1α stability. However, Gleadle et al. (15Gleadle J.M. Ebert B.L. Ratcliffe P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) observed that DPI, a flavoprotein inhibitor whose targets include NADPH oxidases, decreases, rather than enhances, the hypoxia response (15Gleadle J.M. Ebert B.L. Ratcliffe P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Dismutation of superoxide, either spontaneously or through superoxide dismutase, results in the production of hydrogen peroxide. This compound is quite soluble and diffusible and has been postulated as a likely intermediate of the hypoxic signal. Reaction of H2O2 with iron (Fenton reaction) results in the generation of hydroxyradicals, which are highly reactive molecules. To test the role of H2O2 as a signal molecule, we utilized cell lines that overexpress the enzyme catalase either in the cytosol or in the mitochondria. These cell lines have been shown to decompose H2O2 very effectively and to provide resistance to the apoptotic effects of menadione or antimycin (17Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Overexpression of catalase, either in the cytosol or in the mitochondria, did not affect the normoxic levels of HIF-1α protein or its response to hypoxic stimulation. These results cast doubt on the role of H2O2 as a signal molecule in the hypoxic response, either as a negative signal, as postulated by Acker (13Acker H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 718: 1-10Google Scholar) and Fandrey et al. (14Fandrey J. Frere S. Jelkmann W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), or as a positive signal, as postulated by Chandel et al. (16Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A.

The strong stimulatory effect of the iron (III) chelator desferrioxamine in HIF-1α activation suggests that an iron-containing protein(s) is most likely involved in oxygen sensing. In general, iron (III)-chelating agents are not active against heme-containing enzymes or iron-sulfur cluster proteins, although they do interfere with enzymes containing mono-iron or bi-iron centers coordinated to oxygen ligands, including amino acids hydroxylases, lipoxygenases, and ribonucleotide reductase (25Liu Z.D. Lockwood M. Rose S. Theobald A.E. Hider R.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As shown by the studies presented here, the putative oxygen sensor is independent of the mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, and it does not utilize H2O2 as a signal molecule.

To test phosphorylation as a potential regulatory mechanism for this interaction, we analyzed cytoplasmic dynein by two-dimensional gel analysis and detected two intermediate chain variants, one of which was eliminated by phosphatase treatment. Overlay assays demonstrated that p150Glued bound dephosphorylated but not phosphorylated intermediate chains. We then subjected the purified cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain to mass spectrometry and identified a single phosphorylated tryptic fragment corresponding to the p150Glued-binding domain. Fragmentation and retention time analysis mapped the phosphorylation site to serine 84. Site-directed mutants designed to mimic the dephosphorylated or phosphorylated intermediate chain disrupted both in vitro phosphorylation and in vivo phosphorylation of transfected proteins. Mutants mimicking the dephosphorylated form bound p150Glued in vitro and overexpression perturbed transport of dynein-dependent membranes. Mutants mimicking the phosphorylated form displayed diminished p150Glued binding in vitro and did not disrupt dynein-mediated transport when expressed in vivo. These findings represent the first mapping of an intermediate chain phosphorylation site and suggest that this phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating the binding of cytoplasmic dynein to dynactin.

In previous work, we used in vitro and in vivo binding assays to identify cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain (IC)1 binding partners and observed a specific and high affinity interaction with the p150Glued subunit of dynactin, a multi-subunit complex found associated with membranes (3Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) (see also Ref. 4Karki S. Holzbaur E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28806-28811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This interaction implicates dynactin as a receptor or adaptor that mediates the association of cytoplasmic dynein with cargo. Subsequent studies have demonstrated the essential nature of the dynein-dynactin interaction for most examples of dynein-mediated transport (5Holleran E.A. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 182: 69-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Related to the binding of cytoplasmic dynein to membranes is the question of how this binding is regulated. Several dynein subunits have been identified as phosphorylation substrates, and phosphorylation of the ICs (6Dillman J.F. Pfister K.K. J.

Insights into cytoplasmic dynein regulation have the potential to clarify the interactions necessary for cargo binding. In this study we explored the role of IC phosphorylation in regulating the IC-p150Glued interaction. We mapped the site of IC phosphorylation, generated site-directed mutants, and tested the impact of these mutations on the IC-p150Glued interaction. Furthermore, we tested the ability of these IC mutants to compete with intact cytoplasmic dynein for membrane binding and subsequently disrupt dynein-mediated transport. The results support the theory that the IC-p150Glued interaction is pivotal for cytoplasmic dynein targeting to cargo and are the first to demonstrate that IC phosphorylation regulates this interaction. Rat liver homogenates were prepared as described (12Collins C.A. Vallee R.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 14: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and dialyzed in TBS (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). 20 S dynein fractions were prepared by layering 1.5 ml of cytosol on 11 ml of 5–20% sucrose gradients and centrifuging at 31,500 rpm for 16 h. Cytoplasmic dynein-positive fractions sedimenting at ∼20 S were pooled, dialyzed in TBS, concentrated 10-fold with Aquacide III (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), and loaded on two-dimensional gels. Alternatively, ICs were immunoprecipitated from liver cytosol using a 1:100 dilution of anti-IC monoclonal antibody 74.1(13) and protein A beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in TBS plus 1% Nonidet P-40. For two-dimensional gel analysis of immunoprecipitated ICs, full-length IC was competed off the beads by incubation with 4 bed volumes of 1 mg/ml recombinant truncated IC1A (amino acids 1–123 (3Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar)). Two-dimensional gel analysis was performed using a Mini-Protean II 2-D Cell (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer, with 4–6 ampholytes. For phosphatase treatment, 20 µl of immunoprecipitated native dynein (∼200 ng of IC) was treated for 1 h at 30 °C with 800 units of λ phosphatase or mock-treated in the supplied buffer as a control (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). For the two-dimensional analysis of expressed constructs, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and 10% of the cell pellet from each plate was loaded onto a tube gel. After the second dimension, gels were blotted onto Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as described previously (3Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Where indicated, 1% of an Escherichia coli expression lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted, or purified recombinant proteins were applied directly onto Immobilon-P in a slot blot (Bio-Rad). Western blots were probed with a 1:2000 dilution of a polyclonal α-IC-2 antibody (3Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Western blots of two-dimensional gels of 20 S dynein and immunoprecipitated cytoplasmic dynein were indistinguishable. Truncated p150Glued was created by incorporating an NdeI site at the initiator methionine by PCR and cloning the NdeI/BamHI fragment of p150Glued (amino acids 1–811) into pET21d (Novagen, Madison, WI). The construct was cut with SalI, filled in with Klenow fragment, and religated to maintain the C-terminal 6X histidine tag in frame. pET IC-2C 1–125 was created by incorporating an NdeI site by PCR at the initiator methionine, and the NdeI/XhoI fragment of IC-2C (amino acids 1–125) was then cloned into pET14b (Novagen). The serine 81, 83, and 84 mutations were made from this backbone using PCR-directed point mutagenesis. For the mammalian expression constructs, full-length IC-2C was tagged with GFP at the C terminus by creating an NcoI site at the N terminus of GFP and replacing the Myc tag of pCIneoIC-2C3′Myc (14Tynan S.H. Gee M.A. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32769-32774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with GFP. The serine mutations were placed in this backbone. PCIneo-GFP alone was created by putting GFP into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of pCIneo. RFP-NAGT was created by PCR amplification of amino acids 1–106 of the NAGT-Myc tag from plasmid pUHD-NG2 (15Shima D.T. Haldar K. Pepperkok R. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1211-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), introducingEcoRI and BamHI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, and cloning this fragment 5′ to RFP in the plasmid dsRed1-N1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells and purified by nickel affinity chromatography using His-Bind resin (Novagen) as described previously (3Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Blot overlay assays were carried out as previously described (3Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) on blotted gels or slot blots using a 1:200 dilution of 1.0 mg/ml recombinant p150Glued 1-811 as the overlay protein and a 1:500 dilution of monoclonal α-p150Glued antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Approximately 10 µg of immunoprecipitated rat liver cytoplasmic dynein was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the IC-2C band was extracted. The gel slice was tryptically digested “in gel” (16Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Extracted peptides were analyzed by both matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Kratos Kompact SEQ) and electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry (Finnigan Mat LCQ Deca). Analysis by MALDI-MS indicated that a peptide at 2785 Da was phosphorylated because of a companion mass shift of 80 Da. A further analysis of this phosphorylated peptide after ion gating in reflectron mode showed the characteristic loss of 98 Da (H3PO4) (17Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3413-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). To gather additional fragmentation data on the phosphorylated peptide, the digest was analyzed by LC electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry. The digest was run out on an LC Packings Ultimate HPLC with a 100-micron × 15-cm C18 PM column in 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of 0 to 60% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in AcN/water, 70/30) over 40 min at a flow of 500 nl/min. Peptides eluted directly into the Finnigan LCQ Deca ion-trap mass spectrometer equipped with data-dependent acquisition such that a high resolution scan was first performed (to determine monoisotopic mass and charge state) followed by a higher energy MS/MS scan, which typically produces Y- and B-type fragments (18Biemann K. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1988; 16: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) from the precursor mass. Because electrospray produces doubly charged ions of tryptic peptides, we sought peptides with masses consistent with the 2785 peptide in both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states (MH22+ of 1392 and 1432, respectively). These peptides were found along with their corresponding MS/MS scans, which showed two strong fragment ions consistent with fragmentation between the V76–P77 bond producing y9 and b18 fragments. 1 µg of recombinant IC-2C (1) or IC-2C (1) S84D was incubated with either 500 units of casein kinase II (New England Biolabs) or 10 µl of a whole cell extract from COS-7 cells (19Carter A.N. Ausubel F. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1997: 18.7.1-18.7.22Google Scholar) in a 20-µl kinase reaction containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 mm ATP and 5 µCi of [32P]ATP for 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained, and subjected to autoradiography. Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed on total COS-7 cell RNA using primers designed to amplify sequences encoding the N-terminal regions of both IC-1 and IC-2. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing after subcloning into the pT7Blue vector (Novagen). Sequence comparisons were performed using Genetics Computer Group Software (Madison, WI). COS-7 cells were transfected using 1 µg of total plasmid DNA and 3 µl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (20Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 617-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). In co-transfection experiments, 0.8 µg of RFP-NAGT and 0.2 µg of GFP-IC constructs were used. For live cell imaging, cells were passed onto coverslips 8 h after transfection and grown for an additional 6–8 h. Where indicated, 0.1 mg/ml rhodamine-dextran (Molecular Probes) was added to the culture media of transfected coverslips for 8 h prior to live cell imaging. IC-transfected cells were scored for no dispersal, partial dispersal, or complete dispersal in comparison with surrounding untransfected cells. Cells grown on 18-mm glass coverslips were immersed in phenol red-deficient media and imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 equipped with a KX85 cooled-charge coupled device camera (Apogee) using PMIS software (GKR Consulting). Imaging chambers were prepared on glass slides with a border of silicone grease sealed with nail polish. Samples were maintained at 37 °C using a heater directing flow across the microscope stage. Genetic, biochemical, and cell biological analyses have each implicated the dynactin complex as an important, perhaps essential, component of cytoplasmic dynein-mediated transport of cargo (5Holleran E.A. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 182: 69-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two complexes are thought to be linked through a direct and reversible interaction between the cytoplasmic dynein ICs and the p150Glued subunit of dynactin. Because phosphorylation of the ICs has been implicated in regulating dynein function (7Huang C.Y. Chang C.P. Huang C.L. Ferrell Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14262-14269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Pfister K.K. Salata M.W. Dillman III, J.F. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. Torre E. Lye R.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we explored the potential role of IC phosphorylation in regulating the IC-p150Glued interaction. In previous work, cDNA cloning of brain cytoplasmic dynein revealed expression of five IC isoforms derived from alternative splicing of two genes (3Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 13Paschal B.M. Mikami A. Pfister K.K. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1133-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The similar gel mobilities of these polypeptides coupled with phosphorylation of each isoform has complicated two-dimensional gel analysis of ICs (21Pfister K.K. Salata M.W. Dillman III, J.F. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. Torre E. Lye R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1687-1694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To simplify our analysis of IC phosphorylation, we purified cytoplasmic dynein from rat liver in which a single IC isoform is expressed (23Pfister K.K. Salata M.W. Dillman III, J.F. Torre E. Lye R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic dynein was purified from liver cytosol by sucrose sedimentation (20 S dynein) or by immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal α-IC antibody and competitive elution with a truncated polypeptide containing the epitope of the antibody (24Steffen W. Karki S. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. Holzbaur E.L. Weiss D.G. Kuznetsov S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Analysis of either cytoplasmic dynein preparation by two-dimensional gel analysis and Western blotting revealed a pair of IC spots shifted slightly in isoelectric point and molecular weight, suggesting phosphorylation of a single polypeptide (Fig.1 A). When the liver dynein sample was treated with λ-phosphatase prior to electrophoresis, only a single IC spot was observed aligning with the basic IC spot (Fig.1 B), whereas two spots remained in a mock-treated sample (not shown). This polypeptide was subsequently identified as IC-2C by mass spectrometry (see below). IC phosphorylation has been identified in several organisms and tissues. However, the effect of this phosphorylation is not understood. To test the effect of IC phosphorylation on dynactin binding, we used blot overlay assays that demonstrate that p150Glued interacts with the dynein ICs (3Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). For these assays, we prepared a p150Glued expression construct encoding amino acids 1–811, a region containing the IC-binding domain (3Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and epitopes for p150Glued antibodies. We probed two-dimensional gels of purified cytoplasmic dynein by blot overlay with recombinant p150Glued and observed a striking difference in binding between the IC variants; p150Glued bound the dephosphorylated IC spot but displayed no affinity for the phosphorylated IC (Fig.1 C). This difference was apparent over a wide range of p150Glued concentrations and exposure times. These findings indicate that IC phosphorylation has a dramatic effect on p150Glued binding ability and represents a strong candidate as a regulatory mechanism for dynein targeting. To identify phosphorylated residues in the IC polypeptide, we isolated cytoplasmic dynein as described above and mapped sites of IC phosphorylation by mass spectrometry. Total tryptic digests were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and resulting masses were compared with the predicted tryptic digestion pattern of IC-1 and IC-2 rat gene products. In addition, the results were scanned to identify masses corresponding to the tryptic peptides shifted by multiples of 80 Da (the change in mass associated with an added phosphate group). A comparison of fragments covering 40% of the protein confirmed the identity of the rat liver IC as IC-2C. A single tryptic peptide was identified with evidence of phosphorylation (Fig.2 A). This fragment, corresponding to amino acids 59–85 of IC-2C, was present in both native (2785 Da) form and a form corresponding to a single phosphorylation event (2865 Da). No other evidence of phosphorylation was revealed through this analysis. To map the site of phosphorylation in this peptide, the digestion products were separated in an Ion Trap MS instrument, and both native and phosphorylated forms of the amino acids 59–85 peptide were analyzed by post-source decay analysis. This technique fragments proteins at peptide bonds, and data collected from random fragmentation can be used to identify phosphorylated residues. PSD analysis of tryptic IC peptides revealed that both native and phosphorylated IC peptides exhibited dominant fragmentation of the peptide bond between Val-76 and Pro-77 (Fig. 2 A). A comparison of the fragmentation record for the native and phosphorylated forms of the peptide demonstrated that the shift in 80 Da was associated with the C-terminal 9 amino acids of the peptide (Fig. 2 A), a region containing three serines (Ser-81, Ser-83, and Ser-84). Because PSD fragmentation did not occur randomly along the polypeptide backbone in this tryptic fragment, further mapping of the phosphorylated residue was not obtained by this approach. The behavior of the native and phosphorylated IC fragments in the ion trap displayed one unusual feature. Highly charged peptides, such as phosphorylated peptides, typically elute before uncharged peptides in this protocol. However, in this case, the dephosphorylated IC fragment eluted 1.43 min before the phosphorylated form, suggesting a lower net charge on the phosphorylated peptide. The lower net charge on the phosphorylated fragment can be explained if the phosphorylated residue is in close proximity to a positively charged residue. The C-terminal lysine (Lys-85) is next to Ser-84, and the ε-amino group of Lys-85 has the potential to form a “salt-bridge” with a phosphorylated Ser-84, reducing the net charge of the phosphorylated peptide (Fig.2 A). Because of the close molecular proximity required for this effect, the retention time data support the identification of Ser-84 as the IC-2C phosphorylation site. This serine resides within a highly conserved serine cluster in the ICs that is straddled by two regions of alternative splicing (Fig.2 B). Similar to liver dynein, reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of COS-7 cell RNA revealed expression of a single IC isoform corresponding to IC-2C (Fig. 2 B). Two-dimensional gel analysis of COS-7 cell cytoplasmic dynein revealed two IC spots in this sample, suggesting a phosphorylated and dephosphorylated IC form of IC-2C (Fig. 1 D). To corroborate the mass spectrometry data, we generated recombinant site-directed mutants at all three serine residues (Ser-81, Ser-83, and Ser-84) designed to mimic either the dephosphorylated version of the peptide (serine to alanine, S → A) or the phosphorylated version (serine to aspartic acid, S → D). The p150Glued binding abilities of these polypeptides were compared by blot overlay, where the S → A mutants all exhibited similar affinity to wild-type ICs (Fig.3 A). The S81D and S83D mutants also bound p150Glued with normal affinity. However, the S84D mutant displayed reduced binding ability (Fig. 3 A). To quantify the reduction in binding, we prepared slot blots of serial dilutions and probed for p150Glued binding ability (Fig.3 B). S84D mutants bound p150Glued with a 4-fold lower affinity than wild-type IC-2C. Because the S84D mutant mimicked the effect of phosphorylation in these assays and mutations to other residues in this region had no measurable effects, these data indicate that IC phosphorylation at Ser-84 regulates the affinity of ICs for p150Glued. They also support Ser-84 as the site of IC phosphorylation. As another approach to confirm Ser-84 as the site of IC phosphorylation, we tested the ability of cellular kinases to phosphorylate wild-type and IC phosphorylation site mutants. GFP-tagged versions of IC-2C were expressed in COS-7 cells and analyzed for IC complexity by two-dimensional gel analysis and Western blotting (Fig.4 A). The 27-kDa GFP tag ensured that the transfected proteins were well separated from endogenous IC in these cells. Expression of wild-type, S81A (not shown), and S83A mutants each resulted in the generation of two variants consistent with the pattern of endogenous ICs. In contrast, expression of the S84A mutant resulted in only one IC form. These results indicate that when expressed in cells, wild-type, S81A, and S83A mutants are phosphorylated by endogenous kinases, but the S84A mutant is not recognized as a substrate in vivo. To provide direct evidence of phosphorylation, we used total COS-7 cell kinase extracts and tested the phosphorylation potential of wild-type and mutant ICs in vitro. Wild-type IC-2C was phosphorylated by these extracts in vitro; however, we observed no phosphorylation of the S84D mutant (Fig.4 B). These results indicate that the site of IC phosphorylation mapped in liver dynein corresponds to the same site recognized in cultured cells. Although the identity of the IC kinase was not revealed in this analysis, previous work identified the neuron-specific IC isoform (IC-1A) as a substrate for casein kinase II (CKII) in vitro (25Karki S. Tokito M.K. Holzbaur E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5887-5891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Ser-84 does not fit the consensus for CKII (X(S/T)XX(D/E)); however, we tested the ability of CKII to phosphorylate the ICs within this region by preparing wild-type and S84D mutant ICs and subjecting each to in vitro phosphorylation reactions with purified CKII. Both of these polypeptides were phosphorylated equally by CKII (Fig.4 B), indicating phosphorylation at sites other than Ser-84 in this in vitro assay. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the interaction of cytoplasmic dynein with dynactin is important for dynein-mediated transport.

This model is supported by the inhibition of dynein-mediated transport by p50(dynamitin) expression (20Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J.

If the ICs are targeting subunits, overexpression of ICs should saturate dynein-binding sites on the organelle surface, diminish binding of native dynein, and disrupt dynein-dependent organelle transport.

To test the impact of IC phosphorylation mutants on dynein-mediated transport, we co-expressed GFP-tagged ICs with RFP-tagged NAGT (15Shima D.T. Haldar K. Pepperkok R. Watson R. Warren G. J.

The use of RFP and GFP allowed analysis of transfectants as living cells, and eliminated artifacts of fixation and extraction. We focused our studies on cells within 16 h of transfection, before the expressed proteins reached high levels of accumulation. In cells expressing wild-type ICs (Fig.5 B), we observed phenotypes ranging from no Golgi dispersal (Fig. 6,A and B) to partial Golgi dispersal (Fig. 6,C and D) to complete dispersal (Fig. 6,E and F"

Based on the hypothesis that evolutionarily conserved regions are functionally important and likely to interact with coactivators, we compared the amino acid sequence of C/EBPα from different species (frog to human) and identified four highly conserved regions (CR1–CR4) within the transactivation domain. A series of amino-terminal truncations and internal deletion constructs were made creating forms of C/EBPα which lack single or multiple conserved regions. To determine which regions of the C/EBPα transactivation domain are important in its ability to induce spontaneous differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, we infected preadipocytes with expression vectors encoding the C/EBPα conserved region mutants and observed their ability to induce differentiation. We found that CR2 fused to the DNA binding domain is able to induce spontaneous differentiation independent of the other conserved regions. However, CR2 was not necessary for the adipogenic action of C/EBPα because a combination of CR1 and CR3 can also induce adipogenesis. Because the transcriptional coactivator p300 participates in the signaling of many transcription factors to the basal transcriptional apparatus, we examined whether functional interaction exists between C/EBPα and p300. Cotransfection of p300 with p42C/EBPα results in a synergistic increase in leptin promoter activity, indicating that p300 acts as a transcriptional coactivator of C/EBPα. Analyses using C/EBPα conserved region mutants suggest that multiple regions (CR2 and CR3) of the C/EBPα transactivation domain functionally interact with p300.

The importance of understanding adipocyte biology is emphasized further by the complications that arise from either too much or too little adipose tissue. Obesity and its associated disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, are an epidemic in the developed world today (5Wickelgren I. Science. 1998; 280: 1364-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Conversely, lipoatrophy, the lack of adipose tissue, is also associated with diabetes and a number of other metabolic abnormalities (6Reitman M.L. Arioglu E. Gavrilova O. Taylor S.I. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Understanding the factors that govern the transcriptional control of adipogenesis will aid in our understanding of how these disorders arise. A number of the key factors controlling the adipocyte differentiation cascade have been identified (for review, see Refs. 3Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Cell.

Consistent with C/EBPα being a key component in the adipogenic cascade, mice with the c/ebpα gene deleted have a deficiency in lipid accumulation in both white and brown adipose tissue (14Wang N.D.

Moreover, the enforced expression of C/EBPα in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts is sufficient to induce spontaneous adipogenesis (19Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D.

C/EBPα is a prototypical basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor consisting of a well characterized carboxyl-terminal leucine zipper that confers dimerization ability and a neighboring DNA binding domain and nuclear localization signal, which are rich in basic residues (22Landschulz W.H.

Previous studies have arbitrarily divided the transactivation domain and identified regulatory regions within it by examining the ability of these C/EBPα constructs to transactivate reporter genes under the control of the liver serum albumin promoter (29Friedman A.D.

Biol. 1991; 11: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, the current study approaches the functional analyses of the C/EBPα transactivation domain by targeting regions of C/EBPα which are highly conserved across several species (31Erickson R.L. Longo K.A. Ross S.E. Hemati N. MacDougald O.A. Ntambi J. Adipocyte Biology and Hormone Signaling. IOS Press, Amsterdam1999: 79-90Google Scholar). We examined the role of these conserved regions (CR) in the ability of C/EBPα to activate the genes necessary to induce spontaneous preadipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the nuclear coactivator p300 is able to potentiate C/EBPα-mediated transcription of the leptin (ob) promoter through multiple conserved regions within the C/EBPα transactivation domain. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mmsodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 105 μg/ml penicillin G (Sigma PEN-K), 65 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Sigma), and 8.4 μg/ml biotin (Sigma). Cells were incubated in a 10% CO2water-jacketed incubator. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were cultured as described (26Hemati N. Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Groblewski G.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol.

To facilitate cloning of C/EBPα deletion mutants, a +5-nucleotide to +2,111-nucleotide clone of mouse C/EBPα in pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene) containing an ideal Kozak translational start site (32Lin F.-T.

These silent mutations, as described previously (27Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Hemati N. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell.

BamHI toKpnI (pSER13) and KpnI to XhoI (pSER23) fragments of C/EBPα were each subcloned into pBluescript KS+. pSER13 was digested withBamHI and AatII (+307 nucleotides), and aBamHI-AatII oligonucleotide (TableI) was inserted (pSER13ΔCR1). TheBamHI-KpnI fragment of pSER13ΔCR1 was excised and subcloned into pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen) containing full-length p42C/EBPα (pSER28) and resulted in a C/EBPα clone lacking CR1 (pSER28ΔCR1).Table ISynthetic oligonucleotides and PCR primers used to create C/EBPα transactivation domain mutantsOligonucleotideSequenceDeletesBamHI-AatIIGATCCGCCGCCACCATGGAGCCGCTGGGCGGCATCTGCGAGCACGAGACGTCR1AatII-KpnICGGCGGCCGGGTACCR2MluI-SphICGCGTCTGCGCCGCATGCR4KpnI-SphICTGGACCCGCATGCR3 + CR4ΔCR3 5′-primerCCTCTTCGGTACCAGCCACCGCCGCCACCGCCACCGCCGCACCCGCACGCGTCTCCCR3ΔCR3 3′-primerATTGTCACTGGTCAACTCGAGCACCTTCTGTTGCGCR3 Open table in a new tab pSER13 was digested withAatII and KpnI and religated with anAatII-KpnI oligonucleotide (Table I). The resulting vector (pSER13ΔCR2) was then digested with BamHI plus KpnI, and the excised fragment was subcloned into pSER28. The resulting clone lacks CR2 (pSER28ΔCR2). C/EBPα containing CR1 and CR2 was created by digesting pSER23 with KpnI and SphI and ligating in a KpnI-SphI oligonucleotide (Table I; pSER23ΔCR3/4). The KpnI-XhoI fragment of pSER23ΔCR3/4 was then excised and inserted into theKpnI-XhoI site of pSER28, generating CR1/2 (SER28ΔCR3/4). To create expression vectors containing CR1 or CR2 alone fused to the bZIP, theBamHI-KpnI fragment from pSER13ΔCR2 or pSER13ΔCR1, respectively, was subcloned into theBamHI-KpnI site of pSER28ΔCR3/4. A C/EBPα fragment lacking CR3 was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using ΔCR3 primers (Table I) with pSER28 as a template. TOPO TA cloning (Invitrogen) was used to subclone the product into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). A KpnI-XhoI fragment was then excised and subcloned into pSER28ΔCR1 or pSER28ΔCR2, yielding CR2/4 or CR1/4, respectively. The MluI-EcoRV fragment (+698 to +2,111 nucleotides) from the C/EBPα gene (33Christy R.J. Kaestner K.H. Geiman D.E. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To create a non-His-tagged form of CR4, His-p18C/EBPα was linearized with HindIII, and a fill-in reaction was performed to blunt end the vector. The linearized vector was then digested with BglII, and the resulting fragment was subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRV site of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) containing an ideal Kozak consensus sequence oligonucleotide (AGCTTGCGGCCGCCACCATGGG) 5′ to theBamHI site. The expression vectors encoding p30C/EBPα (CR3/4) and p12C/EBPα (bZIP) were described previously (27Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Hemati N. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8433-8441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To create retroviral expression vectors, pLXSN (34Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar) was linearized withHindIII, blunt ends were created using DNA polymerase I, large (Klenow) fragment (New England Biolabs) and ligated with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). The resulting plasmid was digested withHpaI, and a HindIII linker (d(pCAAGCTTG), New England Biolabs) was ligated in to form pNH2. The full-length, p30, CR1, and CR1/3/4 isoforms of C/EBPα were each excised from pcDNA3.1(−) with EcoRI and HindIII and subcloned into the EcoRI-HindIII sites of pNH2. CR2/3/4 and CR2 in pcDNA3.1(+) were first digested withBamHI. The resulting fragment was filled in with DNA polymerase I, large (Klenow) fragment and ligated with anEcoRI linker (d(pCGGAATTCCG), New England Biolabs). This vector was subsequently digested with EcoRI plusHindIII, and the resulting insert was subcloned into pNH2. An expression vector encoding a chimeric protein consisting of the Gal4 DNA binding domain and the C/EBPα transactivation domain was constructed by subcloning a KpnI-SacI fragment of pSER23 into pSG424 (35Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). This construct was subsequently digested withBamHI and KpnI, and theBamHI-KpnI fragment from pSER28 was inserted. Reporter gene assays were performed using leptin promoter-luciferase reporter genes, pObLuc-760 and pObLuc-m760 (from Dr. M. Daniel Lane, Johns Hopkins University (36Hwang C.-S. Mandrup S.

Lazar, University of Pennsylvania). The human p300 expression vector, pVR1012-p300, was donated by Dr. Gary Nabel (National Institutes of Health). pCMV-12S E1A-WT and pCMV-12S E1A-RG2 were created by subcloning the HindIII-NotI fragment of pRc/RSV-12S E1A and pRc/RSV-12S E1A RG2 (from Dr. Roland Kwok, University of Michigan, 38) into the HindIII-NotI site of pcDNA3.1(+). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (100-mm plates) were transiently transfected with 20 μg of total DNA by calcium phosphate coprecipitation, including 1 μg of luciferase reporter gene, 500 ng of CMV-%-galactosidase (%Gal), and 10 μg of sheared herring sperm DNA. Additional plasmid DNA amounts varied based upon experimental conditions and are documented in the figure legends. A constant amount of CMV promoter was maintained in all conditions to control for the potential squelching of the transcriptional machinery. After precipitation for 4–5 h, cells were shocked with 12.5% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline (157 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 5.5 mm Na2HPO4-H2O, pH 7.3) for 3 min. Cells were incubated for 24–48 h in 10% calf serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before they were lysed in 1 × reporter lysis buffer (100 mmKH2PO4, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Samples were vortexed and subsequently centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 30 s at 16,000 ×g. To assay the samples for luciferase activity, 100 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 360 μl of luciferase buffer 2 (25 mm glycylglycine (Fisher Biotech), pH 7.8, 30 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 0.0027% (v/v) Triton X-100, 15 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in glass test tubes. The tubes were then placed in an Optocomp II luminometer (MGM Instruments, Hamden, CT) and injected with 100 μl of luciferase buffer 3 (25 mm glycylglycine, 30 mmMgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 200 nmluciferin (Promega), 2 mm dithiothreitol), and the relative light units emitted were measured and normalized against the relative light units obtained from a chemiluminescent %-galactosidase assay. %-galactosidase activity was measured by taking 10 μl of cell lysate and inoculating 100 μl of %-galactosidase reaction buffer (100 mm KH2PO4, 1 mmMgCl2, 1% (v/v) Galacton (Tropix)) and incubating for 45 min to 1 h at room temperature. Chemiluminescence was measured after the injection of 100 μl of light emission accelerator (10% (v/v) Emerald enhancer (Tropix) in 0.2 n NaOH (39Brasier A.R. Fortin J.J. Ausubel F.M. Brent R.

BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar). Virus-containing medium was collected at three 12-h intervals post-transfection and at each interval passed through a 0.45-μm syringe filter. 8 μg/ml filter-sterilized polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide; Sigma) was added to the virus-loaded medium. This medium was then applied to preconfluent (∼40%) 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The infection protocol was repeated two additional times. After the third round of infection, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were trypsin treated and replated, on multiple plates, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were then allowed to proliferate to confluence, at which point the cells were fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing only 10% calf serum. For 14 days postconfluence the cells were observed for evidence of spontaneous differentiation. To detect cytoplasmic lipid accumulation, retrovirus-infected 3T3-L1 cells were stained by Oil Red-O, essentially as outlined previously (40Preece A. A Manual for Histogic Technicians. Little Brown, Boston1972Google Scholar). Protein expression levels in samples used for reporter gene assays were determined by immunoblot analysis. For detection of p300, supernatant from cells lysed in 1 × reporter lysis buffer was combined with 4 × SDS loading buffer (4% (v/v) SDS, 350 mm %-mercaptoethanol, 240 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (5%). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (Osmonics) membrane, and immunoblotting was performed with mouse monoclonal p300 antibody (BD PharMingen). To determine the expression of C/EBPα, pellets from reporter gene samples were transferred to new tubes, resuspended in Western lysis buffer (1% SDS, 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8), and sonicated. Lysate was mixed with 4 × SDS loading buffer and separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (11.5%), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and immunoblotted with an affinity-purified polyclonal C/EBPα antibody generated against a synthetic polypeptide corresponding to amino acids 253–265 (32Lin F.-T.

Immunoblot analyses of proteins from infected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes were performed as described previously (18Lin F.-T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25913-25919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The adipocyte marker 422/aP2 was detected using a polyclonal antibody received from Dr. David Bernlohr (University of Minnesota). Conserved regions of the C/EBPα transactivation domain were identified by aligning the primary amino acid sequences of human, bovine, mouse, chicken, and frog C/EBPα (31Erickson R.L. Longo K.A. Ross S.E. Hemati N. MacDougald O.A. Ntambi J. Adipocyte Biology and Hormone Signaling. IOS Press, Amsterdam1999: 79-90Google Scholar). Analysis of the alignment revealed four regions within the transactivation domain with a high degree of sequence homology (Fig.1 A). Homology among CR1, 2, 3, and 4 from the mouse and chicken isoforms of C/EBPα is 66, 87, 87, and 94%, respectively. To determine the region within the C/EBPα transactivation domain capable of inducing differentiation, retroviral expression vectors encoding the C/EBPα isoforms depicted in Fig. 1 A were infected into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The adipogenic activity of the various isoforms was measured by the expression of the adipocyte marker 422/aP2 (Fig. 1 B) and Oil Red-O staining of cytoplasmic lipid accumulation (Fig. 1 C). Consistent with the findings of other investigators (19Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 20Lin F.-T. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8757-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), p42C/EBPα induces spontaneous differentiation, but the p30C/EBPα isoform that contains only CR3 and CR4 does not (Fig. 1). Based upon these results and our previous results that a C/EBPα deletion mutant containing only CR1 and CR2 is able to induce differentiation at a level comparable to p42C/EBPα (31Erickson R.L. Longo K.A. Ross S.E. Hemati N. MacDougald O.A. Ntambi J. Adipocyte Biology and Hormone Signaling. IOS Press, Amsterdam1999: 79-90Google Scholar), we examined the contribution of CR1 and CR2 to the adipogenic action of C/EBPα. The C/EBPα construct CR2/3/4, which lacks CR1, was able to induce 422/aP2 expression (Fig. 1 B) and lipid accumulation (data not shown) comparable to p42C/EBPα, suggesting that CR1 is not required for C/EBPα-induced adipogenesis and that CR2 is the adipogenic region. CR1 alone was not sufficient to induce 422/aP2 expression (Fig. 1 B) nor promote cytoplasmic lipid accumulation (Fig. 1 C), whereas CR2 alone was able to induce spontaneous differentiation. This was consistent with CR2 being sufficient to mediate C/EBPα-induced adipogenesis. However, despite lacking CR2, CR1/3/4 is also able to induce adipogenesis (Fig.1 B). Thus it appears that multiple conserved regions within C/EBPα are involved in the adipogenic effect. CR2 is able to contribute independently of the other regions, whereas CR1 and CR3 work in combination. p300 is a nuclear coactivator that has been shown to interact with transcription factors that are important for a number of differentiation paradigms (for review, see Ref. 41Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). We performed a series of experiments to investigate whether p300 coactivates C/EBPα through the adipogenic domains. To determine if p300 is a limiting component and functions as a coactivator of C/EBPα transcription from an adipocyte-specific promoter, reporter gene assays were performed using a C/EBPα-responsive, leptin-luciferase reporter gene (ob-luc). 293T cells, which do not contain endogenous C/EBPα, were transfected with a constant amount of expression vector encoding C/EBPα and an increasing amount of p300 expression vector. The ob-luc activity showed a p300-dependent increase (Fig. 2, top) in the presence of a constant level of C/EBPα, as seen by immunoblotting (Fig. 2, bottom). p300 had no effect on ob-lucactivity in the absence of C/EBPα. Similar results were seen in assays using the PPARγ2 promoter (data not shown). To ensure that the coactivational effects observed were the result of C/EBPα binding the ob promoter and not nonspecific or non-DNA binding events, we performed the reporter gene assay with anob-luciferase reporter gene with a mutation in the C/EBP binding site (mob-luc). This mutation prevents C/EBPα from binding to the promoter (36Hwang C.-S. Mandrup S. MacDougald O.A. Geiman D.E. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and abrogates C/EBPα-dependent transactivation. Consistent with p300 coactivation being mediated through the C/EBPα binding site, coactivation was disrupted in reporter assays utilizingmob-luc (Fig. 3, solid bars). The ability of p300 alone to activate bothob-luc and mob-luc is the result of utilizing high amounts of p300 expression vector (5 μg) in this experiment and is not seen at lower plasmid concentrations (Figs. 2, 4, and 6). These data strongly suggest that p300 is a rate-limiting component in the C/EBPα transcriptional machinery.Figure 3Mutation of the C/EBP binding site in theleptin promoter prevents coactivation by p300.Luciferase reporter gene activity under the control of the wild-type leptin promoter (ob-luc; hatched) or a leptin promoter with the C/EBP binding site mutated (mob-luc;solid) was assayed in 293T cells.

They are rapidly activated by a variety of insults; and recently, receptors linked to cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals have been implicated in such events. One potential class of receptors are those recognizing lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA is a phospholipid signaling molecule that has been shown to cause multiple cellular responses, including increases in cytoplasmic calcium. We examined whether any of the known LPA receptor genes (lp A1/Edg2,lp A2/Edg4, andlp A3/Edg7) are expressed by cultured mouse or rat microglia. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction indicated that mouse microglia predominantly expressed thelp A1 gene, whereas rat microglia predominantly expressed lp A3. Although LPA induced increases in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in both microglial preparations, the responses differed substantially. The Ca2+ signal in rat microglia occurred primarily through Ca2+ influx via the plasma membrane, whereas the Ca2+ signal in mouse microglia was due to release from intracellular stores. Only at high concentrations was an additional influx component recruited. Additionally, LPA induced increased metabolic activity in mouse (but not rat) microglial cells. Our findings provide evidence for functional LPA receptors on microglia. Thus, LPA might play an important role as a mediator of microglial activation in response to central nervous system injury.

Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 312-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3687) Google Scholar). Once activated during a central nervous system insult, microglial cells undergo a rapid, graded response that involves cell migration, proliferation, cytokine release, and trophic and/or cytotoxic effects (1Kreutzberg G.W.

Glia. 1988; 1: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). The signals and mechanisms of microglial activation following central nervous system injury are just beginning to be identified. Although several cytokines, growth factors, and peptides are known to stimulate microglia via receptors on the cell surface (for review, see Ref. 3Gehrmann J. Matsumoto Y. Kreutzberg G.W. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1995; 20: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), other molecules are likely to have important roles as well. One signaling molecule that might regulate microglial activation during central nervous system injury is lysophosphatidic acid (LPA).1 LPA is a bioactive phospholipid mediator that is produced by activated platelets, injured cells, and cells stimulated by growth factors (4Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 5Chun J. Contos J.J. Munroe D. Cell Biochem.

Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). LPA was initially shown to cause multiple biological effects on fibroblasts, including increases in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) and increased proliferative activity (8van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 9Ridley A.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2600-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The effects of LPA are mediated through three distinct G-protein-coupled receptors that are encoded by different genes (lp A1/Edg2,lp A2/Edg4, andlp A3/Edg7) (for review, see Refs. 5Chun J. Contos J.J. Munroe D. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 213-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 6Moolenaar W.H. Exp.

The three LPA receptors differ somewhat in their signal transduction properties. Although activation of any of the three receptors results in increased [Ca2+]c, only the LPA1-mediated response is completely blocked by pertussis toxin (PTX) (10An S. Bleu T. Zheng Y. Goetzl E.J.

All three receptors mediate inhibition of adenylate cyclase, although LPA1 is most effective (7Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol.

In addition, although LPA1 and LPA2 receptors mediate acute neurite retraction, the LPA3 receptor does not (7Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol.

Recent data suggest that LPA may play a prominent role in the central nervous system. Astrocytes are known to respond to LPA with [Ca2+]c increases, lipid peroxidation, DNA synthesis, and cell rounding (13Keller J.N. Steiner M.R. Holtsberg F.W. Mattson M.P. Steiner S.M. J.

Oligodendrocytes respond to LPA with [Ca2+]c increases (17Möller T. Musante D.B. Ransom B.R. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2929-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and have been shown to express the lp A1 gene in vivo (18Weiner J.A. Hecht J.H. Chun J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 398: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Neuroblasts, which also express the lp A1 gene, respond to LPA with cell rounding, proliferation, increased chloride conductances, and activation of a nonselective cation conductance (19Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar,20Dubin A.E. Bahnson T. Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Chun J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1371-1381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mature neurons respond to LPA with [Ca2+]cincreases, rapid growth cone collapse, and neurite retraction (21Saito S. Neurosci.

LPA has also been shown to increase the tight junction permeability of cerebral endothelium and to alter cerebrovascular reactivity (23Tigyi G. Hong L. Yakubu M. Parfenova H. Shibata M. Leffler C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H2048-H2055PubMed Google Scholar, 24Schulze C. Smales C. Rubin L.L. Staddon J.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To date, however, the effects of LPA on microglial cells have not been investigated. In this study, we show that cultured mouse and rat microglia each express LPA receptor genes, albeit different ones. We show that the receptors possess functional signal transduction properties, as the cells respond to LPA with [Ca2+]c signals and increased metabolic activity. Although specific signal transduction aspects may differ between species, our results suggest that LPA is an important signaling molecule that might activate microglial cells in response to central nervous system injury. Microglial cells were prepared from the cortices of newborn (postnatal days 1–3) Swiss-Webster mice or Long-Evans rats as described previously (25Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Möller T. Nolte C. Burger R. Verkhratsky A. Kettenmann H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 615-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cortical tissue was freed from blood vessels and meninges. Tissue was minced, trypsinized for 20 min, triturated with a fire-polished pipette, and washed twice. The cortical cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.) and 20% L929 conditioned medium. Cells were kept at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and 95% air incubator, and the medium was changed every 3–4 days. After 9–21 days, microglial cells were separated from the underlying astrocytic monolayer by gentle agitation using their differential adhesive properties. The resulting cell suspension was spun down at 200 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 with 10% fetal bovine serum. For imaging experiments, microglial cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips at a density of 2 × 104 cells × cm−2 and were allowed to settle for 20 min. Non-adhesive cells were removed by washing in Dulbecco's modified Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were cultured in macrophage serum-free medium supplemented with G5 supplement, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.) and kept in the same medium for 1–2 days before being used for experiments. For RNA isolation, cells were plated in 10-cm polystyrene culture dishes at a density of 5 × 106 and further processed as described above. Cultures routinely consisted of ∼98% microglial cells as determined by staining with Griffonia simplicifoliaisolectin B4 (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA). In addition, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) indicated that the microglial cultures had robust CD11b expression (a microglial marker) and no expression of GFAP (an astrocyte marker; see “Molecular Receptor Characterization by RT-PCR” for primers). The mouse microglial cell line N9 was a kind gift of Dr. M. Righi (International School for Advanced Studies, Trieste, Italy) and cultured in accordance with the original publication (27Righi M. Mori L. De Libero G. Sironi M. Biondi A. Mantovani A. Donini S.D. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 1443-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The mouse microglial cell line BV2 was a kind gift of Dr. E. Blasi (University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy) and cultured in accordance with the original publication (28Blasi E. Barluzzi R. Bocchini V. Mazzolla R. Bistoni F. J. Neuroimmunol. 1990; 27: 229-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). To generate a cDNA template, total RNA from cultured microglial cells was isolated using the RNeasy minikit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For reverse transcription, a 40-µl reaction mixture consisting of 1× Superscript first-strand synthesis buffer, 20 units of RNasin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.5 mm each dNTP (Sigma), 10 µg of RNA, 2 µl (200 pmol) of diluted random hexamers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 200 units of Superscript (Life Technologies, Inc.) was incubated at 23 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 60 min, and 95 °C for 5 min; cooled on ice; diluted to 100 µl with H2O; and stored at −20 °C. PCRs of 25 µl consisted of 1× PCR buffer (75 mm Tris (pH 9.0) and 15 mm(NH4)2SO4), 0.25 mmeach dNTP, 0.5 mm each primer, 1 µl of template (i.e. the equivalent of 0.1 µg of total RNA), and 0.5 units of Taq polymerase (Taq polymerase was added after the reaction mixture was overlaid with mineral oil and heated to 90 °C). Reaction mixtures were cycled 35 times at 95 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. The number of cycles for all PCRs shown was adjusted so that product was not maximized as compared with quantities obtained with excess product as template (35 cycles were used for each LPA receptor gene, and 25 cycles were used for the β-actin reactions). All primers were designed to different exons within genes so genomic DNA contaminants would not be amplified. Primer combinations, relative locations, and expected product sizes were as follows: lpAe3mh/lpA1e4mh, exons 3 and 4, 349 bp; lpA2e2mh1/lpA2e3mh1, exons 2 and 3, 798 bp; lpA3e1dmh/lpA3e2mh1, exons 2 and 3, 382 bp; GFAPmh3/GFAPmh4, 956 bp; CD11bmh1/CD11bmh2, 545 bp; and β-actin a (any)/β-actin b (any), 630 bp.

Microglial cells were loaded with Ca2+ indicator by incubation of glass coverslips with adhered cells in HEPES bathing solution supplemented with 5 µm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and 0.02% Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for ∼30 min at room temperature. For [Ca2+]cmeasurements, microglial cells on coverslips were placed in a perfusion chamber on the stage of an inverted microscope (Diaphot 200, Nikon Inc., Melville, NY) equipped with either 20×/0.75 NA air or 40×/1.3 NA oil immersion objectives. Fura-2 was excited using a Lambda DG-4 filter system (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) at wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, and the fluorescence emission was collected at a wavelength of 510 ± 20 nm via a band-pass filter. Acquisition of the fluorescence data and image analysis were performed using a digital imaging system (R3, Inovision Corp., Durham, NC) and standard PC evaluation software. Ratios were collected at time intervals varying between 1 and 5 s. [Ca2+]c was calculated using the method of Grynkiewicz et al. (29Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).R min, R max, andb were obtained using a Fura-2 Ca2+ calibration kit (F-6774, Molecular Probes, Inc.). Substances were applied by changing the perfusion buffer. LPA was stored as a 1 mmstock solution in Me2SO at −20 °C, and LPA-containing buffer was vigorously vortexed immediately prior to each application. Application of Me2SO alone did not induce any detectable [Ca2+]c signals. The use of bovine serum albumin-solubilized LPA was not feasible, as the protein interfered with the perfusion system. At the end of an experiment, the application of ATP served as a control for the viability and responsiveness of the cells. ATP is known to cause robust increases in [Ca2+]c via Ca2+ release and influx (30Walz W. Ilschner S. Ohlemeyer C. Banati R. Kettenmann H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4403-4411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Möller T. Kann O. Verkhratsky A. Kettenmann H. Brain Res. 2000; 853: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]c signals were defined as [Ca2+]c changes ≥1.2 × base line. Standard PC data analysis software was used for post-imaging analysis. All experiments were carried out with at least three independent cultures. Recordings are presented as population responses of one coverslip unless otherwise indicated. Microglial metabolic activity was assessed in 96-well plates with 2 × 104 cells/well in 150 µl of RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). LPA (1, 3, 10, and 30 µm) was directly dissolved in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with lipid-free bovine serum albumin (0.1%) to improve the solubility of LPA. Controls received the carrier only. 1–2 days after plating, cells were stimulated with LPA for 1 h, carefully washed with Dulbecco's modified Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, and cultured in 150 µl of RPMI 1640 medium. For assessing the metabolic activity 24 and 48 h later, cells were incubated with 15 µl of the cell proliferation test reagent WST-1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30–60 min. This colorimetric assay is based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt WST-1 by mitochondrial dehydrogenase in viable cells. The amount of cleaved WST-1 is proportional to the activity of mitochondria and can be used as a readout for metabolic activity and/or proliferation. The assay was used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Absorption was measured at 450 nm with 750 nm as reference in a microplate reader (EL 340, Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski,VT). Metabolic activity/proliferation is given as percent change compared with control. All experiments were carried out with a minimum of six wells/condition (n ≥ 6). Standard HEPES bathing solution for experiments with cultured cells was composed of 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.35). To obtain Ca2+-free solution, CaCl2 was omitted; MgCl2 was increased to 2 mm; and 0.5 mm EGTA was added. For the application of lidocaine (40 mm), NaCl was reduced to 110 mm. Reagents were prepared from stock solutions stored at −20 °C by dilution in standard or calcium-free extracellular bathing solution immediately prior to use. If not stated otherwise, chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Statistical evaluation was carried out using PRISM software (GraphPAD, San Diego, CA). Comparisons were made by analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post-test, andp < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Data are given as means ± S.E. To examine expression of the three known LPA receptor genes (lp A1/Edg2,lp A2/Edg4, andlp A3/Edg7) in microglial cells, we utilized RT-PCR (Fig. 1). Primers were designed to sequences conserved between mouse and human sequences. Robust cDNA amplification from rat testes and kidney, two tissues that express all three receptor genes, showed that the primers also recognized rat sequences. In three independent primary microglial cell cultures from mouse, we found that lp A1 was the primary LPA receptor gene expressed, with little or nolp A2 and lp A3. In contrast, three independent primary microglial cultures from rat expressed primarilylp A3, with little or no lp A1 andlp A2. We also examined expression of the three receptors in two microglial cell lines. The mouse N9 cell line expressed only lp A2, whereas BV2 expressed none of the receptors. These results suggest that microglial cells from mouse and rat would respond to LPA, although these responses might differ based on the distinct coupling properties of the three receptors. To investigate the ability of LPA to induce [Ca2+]c signals in cultured microglia, Fura-2-loaded cells were stimulated with varying concentrations of LPA in a perfusion chamber. We initially determined that individual rat microglial cells had variable responses to the same concentrations of LPA, although increasing LPA concentrations resulted in a higher probability of response (Fig.2 A, insets). This variability at the level of single cells was probably due to the poor solubility of LPA in aqueous solutions and the resulting formation of micelles. To compensate for this, average population responses were determined, which facilitated quantitative comparisons. Microglial cells were stimulated consecutively with 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3 µm LPA. In the shown experiment (Fig. 2 A), the percentage of rat microglial cells responding with a [Ca2+]c signal (defined as ≥1.2 × base line) to LPA stimulation increased in a concentration-dependent fashion from 15% for 30 nm LPA to 100% for 3 µm LPA (Fig.2 A). No response was seen at 10 nm in any experiment. Pooled data from several experiments were used to construct a concentration-response graph (Fig. 2 B). Repeated application of LPA (e.g. three applications of ≤3 µm LPA for 30 s, with 5-min intervals) did not lead to a reduction in the number of cells responding or a significant decrease in the response amplitude (data not shown). Based on these findings, we used 3 µm LPA for our further studies. We did not use higher LPA concentrations, as they would have necessitated increased solvent (Me2SO) concentrations of >0.3%. Mouse microglial cells showed a similar heterogeneity in responses of individual cells (data not shown). Nevertheless, LPA induced [Ca2+]c signals with two different kinetic profiles. At concentrations ≤1 µm, LPA induced a transient [Ca2+]c signal. At higher concentrations, LPA induced a [Ca2+]c signal with an initial peak-like component, followed by a long-lasting [Ca2+]c elevation, which depended partially on extracellular Ca2+ (Fig.3 A). In contrast to rat microglia, the LPA-induced [Ca2+]c signals in mouse microglia showed a pronounced desensitization to repeated application of LPA (Fig. 3, B and C). At concentrations ≤1 µm LPA, the number of cells responding to a second or third application was reduced by ∼50%; but between LPA applications, the [Ca2+]c returned to the base line. At 3 µm LPA, the number of cells responding to repeated LPA application was reduced by only ∼30%; but after the first LPA application, [Ca2+]c was maintained at a new steady-state level above the base line, and the transients had a substantially reduced amplitude. Because of this desensitization, the concentration-response graph shown in Fig. 2 B was obtained from initial responses in separate experiments. In contrast to the rat cells, which showed responses only at concentrations ≥30 nm, mouse microglial cells showed responses to LPA concentrations as low as 3 nm. LPA-induced increases in [Ca2+]c have been shown to be due both to influx through the plasma membrane and to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated release from intracellular stores (10An S. Bleu T. Zheng Y. Goetzl E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 17Möller T. Musante D.B. Ransom B.R. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2929-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,20Dubin A.E. Bahnson T. Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Chun J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1371-1381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the origin of the observed LPA-induced [Ca2+]c signals in rat microglial cells, 3 µm LPA was applied in Ca2+-free bathing solution (Fig. 4 A). This treatment completely abolished the [Ca2+]ctransients, suggesting that the LPA-induced [Ca2+]c signals were entirely of extracellular origin. This hypothesis was further supported by three experiments. First, we observed a normal LPA-induced [Ca2+]cincrease after pretreatment of cells with thapsigargin (500 nm, 30 min) (Fig. 4 B), a compound that inhibits the endoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase and results in a depletion of endoplasmic Ca2+ stores (32Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). The depletion of the endoplasmic Ca2+ stores was confirmed by a lack of response to UTP (100 µm), a metabotropic agonist for microglial cells that stimulates increased [Ca2+]c through endoplasmic release (31Möller T. Kann O. Verkhratsky A. Kettenmann H. Brain Res. 2000; 853: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Second, the LPA-induced [Ca2+]c transients were blocked by La3+ (100 µm), a nonselective cation channel blocker (Fig. 4 C). Viability of the cells during La3+ treatment was demonstrated by the ability of the cells to generate an ATP-induced [Ca2+]c signal. Third, lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker known to interfere with LPA-induced ion currents (33Nietgen G.W. Chan C.K. Durieux M.E. Anesthesiology. 1997; 86: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), reduced the response magnitude and percentage of cells responding to LPA from 95.8 ± 3.8 to 14.8 ± 4.1% (n = 168) (Fig. 4 D). Removal of lidocaine from the bathing solution restored the LPA-induced [Ca2+]c responses to 88.7 ± 5.2%. This result further supports the hypothesis that a plasma membrane ion channel is involved in the rat [Ca2+]c response. In contrast to rat microglial cells, the LPA-induced [Ca2+]c signal in mouse microglial cells persisted in Ca2+-free buffer, indicating an intracellular release component (Fig.5 A). Preincubation with thapsigargin (500 nm, 30 min) blocked the signals at LPA concentrations ≤1 µm, whereas 3 µm LPA induced a [Ca2+]c transient, which was dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 5 B). This indicates that, in mouse microglial cells, lower concentrations of LPA result in Ca2+ release from stores, whereas at high LPA concentrations, an additional plasma membrane influx pathway is recruited. This transmembrane influx was blocked by Ca2+-free buffer, lidocaine (40 mm) (data not shown), or La3+ (10 µm) (Fig.5 C). To investigate which G-proteins mediate the [Ca2+]c signal in microglia, cells were preincubated with 1 µg/ml PTX for 2 h. This treatment, which ADP-ribosylates and inhibits Gi/Go proteins, was shown to be effective in cultured microglial cells (26Möller T. Nolte C. Burger R. Verkhratsky A. Kettenmann H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 615-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PTX did not prevent LPA-induced [Ca2+]c transients in rat microglial cells (Fig. 4 E), but completely blocked the response in mouse microglial cells (Fig. 5 D) Increased metabolic activity and/or proliferation is a common feature of activated microglial cells. To investigate if LPA induces increases in microglial metabolic activity/proliferation, cells were incubated with LPA (1, 3, 10, or 30 µm) for 1 h. Metabolic activity/proliferation was assessed 24 and 48 h later using the WST-1 assay, which relies on the measurement of mitochondrial activity as a readout for metabolic activity and/or proliferation. We found that LPA induced concentration-dependent increases in metabolic activity in mouse microglial cells after 24 and 48 h, whereas rat microglial cells did not show such increases (Fig.6). The effects of LPA are mediated through at least three known G-protein-coupled receptors encoded by different genes (lp A1/Edg2,lp A2/Edg4, andlp A3/Edg7) (for review, see Refs. 5Chun J. Contos J.J. Munroe D. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 213-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and6Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Although we showed that LPA receptor genes are expressed by cultured microglial cells from mouse and rat, it was surprising to find that different receptor subtypes were expressed by the different species. Primary rat microglial cultures predominantly expressedlp A3, whereas primary mouse microglial cultures predominantly expressed lp A1. The different receptor genes expressed by the different species suggested that different LPA responses might be observed in the different cultures since the receptor subtypes differ somewhat in their coupling specificities (7Contos J.J.

Pak1 and ROCK, respectively, activate LIMK1 and LIMK2 downstream of Rac and Rho; however, an effector protein kinase for LIMKs downstream of Cdc42 remains to be defined. We now report evidence that LIMK1 and LIMK2 activities toward cofilin phosphorylation are stimulated in cells by the co-expression of myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase α (MRCKα), an effector protein kinase of Cdc42.

Previous studies showed that two closely related LIMKs, LIMK1 and LIMK2, regulate actin cytoskeletal reorganization; LIMK-induced actin cytoskeletal rearrangement is mediated by cofilin, an actin depolymerizing factor of actin filaments (8Arber S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family is responsible for the turnover of actin filaments and probably is a potential downstream effector of signaling pathways that evoke reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (11Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 12Bamburg J.R. McGough A. Ono S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33827-33830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Activated LIMK catalyzes phosphorylation of an N-terminal third serine residue of cofilin and inhibits its activity to depolymerize actin filaments, thereby leading to stabilization of actin filaments. Our studies show that the XLIMK, the Xenopuscounterpart of mammalian LIMK (14Takahashi T. Aoki S. Nakamura T. Koshimizu U. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 209: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), is critically involved in the progression of progesterone-induced Xenopus oocyte maturation through Xenopus cofilin phosphorylation (15Takahashi T. Koshimizu U. Abe H. Obinata T. Nakamura T. Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 554-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, LIMKs may be a key component of a fundamental signal transduction system that connects the extracellular stimuli that alter actin cytoskeletal rearrangements. The Rho family GTPases (including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) are key regulators in signaling pathways that link extra- and intracellular stimuli to actin cytoskeletal reorganization (16Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5200) Google Scholar, 17Schmid A. Hall M.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 305-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 18Kaibuchi K.

Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar). Among several downstream effectors of Rho family GTPases that are involved in regulating actin cytoskeleton, LIMK1 and LIMK2 play a role in actin cytoskeletal reorganization downstream of distinct Rho family GTPases (8Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar, 9Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). LIMK1 is regulated by Rac and Cdc42, whereas LIMK2 is regulated by Rho and Cdc42; LIMKs have a definitive role in the Rho family GTPases-induced actin cytoskeletal rearrangement (8Arber S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that Pak1 activates LIMK1 downstream of Rac1 (20Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), and ROCK activates LIMK2 downstream of RhoA (21Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A.

However, an effector protein kinase that phosphorylates/activates LIMKs downstream of Cdc42 remained to be defined. We now report that myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase α (MRCKα), a Cdc42-dependent protein kinase (23Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), activates both LIMK1 and LIMK2 downstream of Cdc42. Our results define a signal transduction pathway wherein MRCKα activates LIMK1 and LIMK2 downstream of Cdc42, which in turn regulates the actin cytoskeletal reorganization through phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin. Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody (12CA5) and anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-cofilin polyclonal antibody was purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver, CO). Y-27632 was generously provided by WelFide Co. (Osaka, Japan). The expression plasmids for HA-tagged LIMK1, LIMK2 and its mutants, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused cofilin, and GST-fused LIMK protein kinase domain (PK) were constructed as described elsewhere (10Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. Nakamura T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 22Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Biol.

Narumiya (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). Expression plasmid for Cdc42V12 was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Takai (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). To generate the plasmid encoding for full-length MRCKα (amino acids 1–1732), partial rat MRCKα cDNA fragments were cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR using a set of the following primers: A fragment, forward, 5′-GAGTCACAGCAGGTCCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGGCAGATTGCAACTCGAGTC-3′; B fragment, forward, 5′-CATGTCAGCTAGACTCGAGTT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CACACACAGGCAGGACA-3′; C fragment, forward, 5′-CGACAGCACTCTACCCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTGCGGCCGCTCATGGATCCCAGCTCC-3′. These PCR products were digested with the following enzymes: A fragment, AatII andXhoI; B fragment, XhoI and SacI; C fragment, SacI and NotI. The digested fragments were ligated to AatII- and NotI-digested pEF-BOS-myc-MRCK-ΔC. To generate plasmids encoding MRCK-ΔC (amino acids 1–574), rat MRCKα cDNA fragment was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR using a set of the following primers: forward, 5′-GCGGATCCATGTCTGGAGAAGTGCGTTTGA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGGGATCCTCACAGTTTCCTCTGACAGTGTGCG-3′. The PCR product digested withBamHI was ligated to the BamHI-digested pEF-BOS-myc vector (10Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. Nakamura T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The cDNA for the kinase defective mutant of MRCK-ΔC (kinase-dead (KD)) was constructed to introduce substitution of the 106th Lys with Ala, using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The authenticity of these expression plasmids was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HeLa cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with FBS and non-essential amino acids. Subconfluent COS-7 cells were trypsinized and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and 106 cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA by electroporation using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were cultured for 36 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. HeLa cells were cultured for 12 h at a density of 6 × 103/cm2 and then further cultured for 16 h in serum-free MEM. The cells were transfected in Opti-MEM containing 3 μg of plasmid DNA complexed with LipofectAMINE. After a 2-h incubation, the medium was replaced with serum-free MEM, and the cells were cultured for 22 h. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmid as described above. The cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5m NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was preadsorbed with 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK) for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged to remove protein G-Sepharose, and the supernatant was then incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with anti-HA or anti-Myc antibody and 5 μl of protein G-Sepharose. Protein G-Sepharose beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and dissolved in the sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. The immunoprecipitates and cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and probed with anti-HA and anti-Myc antibody as described elsewhere (10Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. Nakamura T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar,22Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 670-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Proteins reacting with these antibodies were detected using ECL enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For protein kinase assay, immunoprecipitates bound to protein G-Sepharose were washed three times with kinase buffer consisting of 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4 and then incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in 15 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 6 μg of GST-cofilin or 2 μg of GST-PK as substrate. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by heat treatment (100 °C for 3 min) in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. The transfected HeLa cells were dissolved in two-dimensional lysis buffer composed of 9.5 m urea, 2% Triton X-100, 2% ampholine (pH 3.5–10), and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to non-equilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis (NEpHGE) (24O'Farrell P.Z. Goodman H.M. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1977; 12: 1133-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out in a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel for the second dimension. Proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, probed with anti-cofilin antibody, and then detected using ECL enhanced chemiluminescence. The spot densities of immunoblots were analyzed using NIH Image software (Wayne Rasband Analytics, National Institutes of Health). We reported earlier that the activity of the LIM kinases, LIMK1 and LIMK2, is distinctly regulated by Rho family GTPases (10Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. Nakamura T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). ROCK, a Rho-dependent protein kinase, specifically activates LIMK2 but not LIMK1 downstream of Rho (22Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 670-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To further confirm the specific activation pathway of LIM kinases by Rho family GTPases, we examined the effects of Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of ROCK, on the activation of LIM kinases by Cdc42 (Fig. 1). Consistent with our previous data (10Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. Nakamura T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), LIMK1 activity toward cofilin phosphorylation was stimulated 1.8-fold when co-expressed with the dominant active form of Cdc42 (Cdc42V12) (Fig. 1 A), whereas the addition of Y-27632 did not affect the LIMK1 activity enhanced by Cdc42V12. Likewise, Y27632 did not significantly inhibit basal LIMK1 activity in cells expressing LIMK1 alone. On the other hand, in cells expressing LIMK2 alone, Y-27632 inhibited LIMK2 activity to the half level. Since Rho-dependent LIMK2 activation was completely blocked by Y-27632 treatment (22Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 670-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), basal LIMK2 activity is regulated by endogenous Rho-ROCK pathways in cells. When LIMK2 was co-expressed with Cdc42V12, LIMK2 activity was stimulated about 1.6-fold (Fig. 1 B). Activation of LIMK2 by Cdc42V12 was inhibited by Y-27632; however, Y-27632 did not inhibit LIMK2 activity to the level seen in Y-27632-treated cells expressing LIMK2 alone. Thus, even under conditions wherein ROCK is inhibited in the presence of Y-27632, expression of Cdc42V12 significantly increased LIMK2 activity. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that LIM kinases are regulated by another protein kinase(s) that differs from ROCK downstream of Cdc42. To identify the upstream protein kinase of LIM kinases, we searched for the effector protein kinases of Cdc42. We speculated that MRCK might be a candidate protein kinase of LIM kinase, because MRCK plays a key role in formation of filopodial protrusion downstream of Cdc42 and is structurally related to Rho kinase/ROCK (23Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To determine whether MRCK would activate LIM kinases downstream of Cdc42, we constructed expression plasmids for MRCKα (Fig.2 A). MRCK-ΔC is deleted with the C-terminal regulatory region containing GTPase-binding and PH domains. MRCK-ΔC/KD has a substituted amino acid involved in ATP binding in the protein kinase domain, and thus MRCK-ΔC/KD is likely to act in a kinase-deficient form. As shown in Fig. 2 B(left panels), co-expression of MRCK-ΔC stimulated LIMK1 activity toward cofilin phosphorylation. Likewise, LIMK2 activity was stimulated by the co-expression with MRCK-ΔC (Fig. 2 B, right panels). These stimulatory effects of MRCK-ΔC on LIMK1 and LIMK2 depended on protein kinase activity, because the kinase-dead form of MRCK-ΔC (MRCK-ΔC/KD) did not stimulate LIM kinases activity. We recently found that the dominant active form of ROCK (ROCK-Δ3) nonselectively activates both LIMK1 and LIMK2, whereas the wild-type ROCK specifically activates LIMK2 but not LIMK1; thus the C-terminal half containing the Rho-binding and PH domains of ROCK is susceptible to specific substrates (22Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 670-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). MRCKα has similar functional domains consisting of cysteine-rich, PH, and GTPase-binding domains within the C-terminal regulatory region (Fig. 2 A); these domains play an important role in Cdc42-induced filopodial protrusion and neurite outgrowth (23Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 25Chen X.-Q. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19901-19905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether full-length MRCKα would specifically activate either LIMK1 or LIMK2. Consistent with previous notions (22Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 670-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), LIMK2 but not LIMK1 activity was specifically activated about 2.3-fold by the co-expression of wild-type ROCK (Fig.2 C). In contrast, LIMK1 and LIMK2 activities in cells co-expressing wild-type MRCKα were stimulated, respectively, to a 1.9- and 2.3-fold higher level than seen in cells expressing LIMK1 or LIMK2 alone (Fig. 2 C). These results indicate that MRCKα activates both LIMK1 and LIMK2 activity as an upstream protein kinase. Because activation of LIMK2 by ROCK is mediated by the phosphorylation of Thr-505 in the activation segment within the protein kinase domain of LIMK2 (22Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 670-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), we determined whether activation of LIM kinases by MRCKα might also be mediated through phosphorylation of the protein kinase domain of LIM kinases. Wild-type LIMK2 activity was stimulated 6-fold with the co-expression with MRCK-ΔC (Fig.3 A). Similarly, the kinase activity of the PK mutant (LIMK2 with the deleted N-terminal half containing LIM and PDZ domains) was also stimulated by 5-fold with the co-expression of MRCK-ΔC. Thus, MRCKα-dependent LIMK2 activation is apparently mediated by the protein kinase domain of LIMK2. To determine whether PKs are phosphorylated directly by MRCKα, we respectively prepared recombinant GST-fused PKs (GST-PKs) of LIMK1 and LIMK2. The GST-PKs were subjected to an in vitrophosphorylation assay (Fig. 3 B). MRCK-ΔC directly phosphorylated the protein kinase domain of LIMKs, whereas MRCK-ΔC/KD did not induce protein phosphorylation of GST-PKs. Because MRCKα shares a similar substrate specificity with Rho kinase/ROCK (23Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 26Nakamura N. Oshiro N. Fukuta Y. Amano M. Fukuta M. Kuroda S. Matsuura Y. Leung T. Lim L. Kaibuchi K. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and ROCK-Δ3 phosphorylates a conserved threonine residue (Thr-508 in LIMK1, Thr-505 in LIMK2) within the activation segment of LIM kinases (22Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 670-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 27Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 249: 138-145Google Scholar), we hypothesized that this conserved threonine residue might be a site phosphorylated by MRCKα. To address this possibility, we expressed MRCK-ΔC together with LIMK2T505V or LIMK2T505E and examined the potential of MRCK-ΔC to activate each mutant LIMK2 (Fig. 3 C). The kinase activity of wild-type LIMK2 was enhanced to a 7.5-fold higher degree over the control by co-expression with MRCK-ΔC together with phosphorylation of LIMK2. In contrast, neither activation of LIMK2T505V nor LIMK2T505V phosphorylation was evident by co-expression with MRCK-ΔC. The kinase activity of LIMK2T505E mutant was 2.8-fold higher than that of wild-type LIMK2, presumably mimicking the phosphorylation state of LIMK2. However, the kinase activity of LIMK2T505E was not significantly changed by co-expression with MRCK-ΔC. These results suggest that MRCKα activates LIMK2 through Thr-505 phosphorylation in the protein kinase domain of LIMK2. It seemed important to determine whether both LIMK1 and LIMK2 would function as downstream effectors on MRCKα-mediated signal transduction toward cofilin phosphorylation. We next used extracts from transfected HeLa cells and subjected them to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated ADF/cofilin was detected using immunoblotting techniques (Fig.4). Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated ADF/cofilin was clearly distinguishable as the electrophoretic mobility was distinct. As shown in Fig. 4 A, in mock-transfected HeLa cells, ADF/cofilin was either not phosphorylated or was only marginally phosphorylated. In contrast, when LIMK1 was expressed in cells, phosphorylated ADF/cofilin increased to 45% of the total ADF/cofilin. Phosphorylation of ADF/cofilin was undetectable in cells expressing the protein kinase-deficient form of LIMK1 (LIMK1/KD). Similar results were obtained when LIMK2 was expressed in cells. Phosphorylated ADF/cofilin increased to 44% of the total ADF/cofilin, whereas phosphorylated ADF/cofilin was not evident in cells expressing LIMK2/KD. On the other hand, when MRCKα was expressed in cells, phosphorylated ADF/cofilin increased to 64% of the total ADF/cofilin (Fig. 4 B). Because MRCKα does not directly phosphorylates ADF/cofilin (data not shown), this MRCKα-induced phosphorylation of ADF/cofilin may possibly be mediated via LIM kinases. Consistent with this notion, MRCKα-induced phosphorylation of ADF/cofilin was reduced, respectively, to 24 and 18% of the total ADF/cofilin with the co-expression with LIMK1/KD and LIMK2/KD. Furthermore, when MRCKα was co-expressed with both LIMK1/KD and LIMK2/KD, MRCKα-induced ADF/cofilin phosphorylation was almost completely inhibited. These results strongly indicate that LIMK1 and LIMK2 function as downstream effectors of MRCKα and play a role in MRCKα-induced actin cytoskeletal reorganization through inactivation (phosphorylation) of ADF/cofilin. In the present study, we found that MRCKα, a downstream effector of Cdc42, phosphorylates and activates both LIMK1 and LIMK2 and participates in the activation of LIM kinases downstream of Cdc42. Taken together with previous notions that LIMK1 is activated by Pak1 downstream of Rac1 (20Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) and that ROCK specifically activates LIMK2 downstream of RhoA (22Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 670-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), these observations define signal transduction pathways through which Rho family GTPases regulate cofilin-mediated actin filament depolymerization. The actin cytoskeletal network in eukaryotic cells participates in cellular processes, including locomotion, shape changes, cytokinesis, and maintenance of polarity (28Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3263) Google Scholar, 29Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). The rapid assembly and disassembly of actin filaments are regulated both spatially and temporally during these processes. The spatiotemporal reorganization of actin cytoskeleton seen with extracellular stimuli is regulated through distinct Rho family GTPases and their specific effectors (16Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5200) Google Scholar, 17Schmid A. Hall M.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 305-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 18Kaibuchi K.

In terms of actin filament depolymerization, signal transduction pathways,i.e. Cdc42-MRCK-LIMKs, Rac-Pak1-LIMK1, and Rho-ROCK-LIMK2, may play distinct role in regulating cofilin-mediated actin filament depolymerization so that it occurs in a definite spatiotemporal manner. By way of support for this notion, LIMK1 plays a role in Rac-induced lamellipodia formation, whereas LIMK2 plays a role in Cdc42-induced filopodial formation and Rho-induced stress fiber formation (8Arber S.

Nutr. 1997; 17: 405-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These include the central enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis: ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC),1 and fatty acid synthase (FAS). In addition, enzymes of glycolysis, such as pyruvate kinase (l-PK); of NADPH generation, such as malic enzyme; of fatty acid maturation, such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase and of triglyceride formation, such as glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase are induced in response to dietary carbohydrate. For most of the genes examined, transcription is the major site of control, although changes in stability play a role in controlling mRNA induction for certain gene products. Both insulin and glucose play a role in the process by which high carbohydrate diet induces lipogenic gene expression. The actions of insulin are mediated at least in part by SREBP-1c (for review, see Refs. 3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar, 4Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Curr. Opin.

This basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper transcription factor is induced at the level of transcription in response to insulin (6Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G.

In turn, SREBP-1c binds to the promoters of a number of the lipogenic enzyme genes to enhance their expression (e.g. Refs. 9Magana M.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32689-32694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 10Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

Consequently, mice bearing a homozygous deletion of the SREBP-1 gene show an impaired ability to induce lipogenic enzymes in response to a high carbohydrate diet compared with normal littermates (12Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J.-I. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Ishihashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol.

Similarly, transgenic mice overexpressing the nuclear form of SREBP-1c in their liver have elevated rates of lipogenesis and increased mRNA levels for many of the lipogenic enzyme genes (13Shimano H.

In addition to insulin, glucose also provides an important signal for induction of the lipogenic enzyme genes (15Vaulont S. Vasseur-Cognet M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31555-31558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Primary hepatocytes cultured in the presence of constant insulin levels display a marked induction of most lipogenic enzyme genes when glucose concentrations in the media are elevated above fasting levels. This response requires increased glucose metabolism; however, the intracellular pathway responsible for mediating the actions of glucose remains unresolved. Sequences important for the transcriptional induction by glucose have been identified in three genes to date: FAS2,l-PK, and S14 (16Bergot M.-O. Diaz-Guerra M.-J.M. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A.

S14 encodes a 17-kDa gene product postulated to play a regulatory role in the lipogenic process (20Cunningham B.A. Moncur J.T. Huntington J.T. Kinlaw W.B. Thyroid. 1998; 8: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In all three cases, the critical regulatory element, designated the ChoRE, consists of two E box half-sites related to the sequence 5′-CACG (19Koo S.-H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These half-sites are found oriented in either direct or inverted fashion, but the spacing between them is critical for the ability to respond to glucose. Recently, we have detected by EMSA a novel nuclear protein that recognizes the ChoREs of these three genes and designated this factor as the carbohydrate responsive factor or ChoRF (19Koo S.-H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The identity of ChoRF is currently unknown. Although ChoRF has been predicted to be a member of the basic/helix-loop-helix family based on its binding site, it is distinct from SREBP-1c by a number of criteria (21Koo S.-H. Dutcher A.K. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9437-9445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). ACC catalyzes the first step in fatty acid synthesis and is under complex control (for review, see Ref. 22Kim K.-H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 77-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Two genes for ACC, designated α and β, exist. The β form is expressed predominantly in the heart and skeletal muscle and may play a role in regulating fatty acid oxidation (23Ruderman N.B. Saha A.K. Vavvas D. Witters L.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E1-E18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α gene is expressed ubiquitously and its expression is induced by nutritional and hormonal signals that promote increased lipogenesis (24Lopez-Casellas F. Ponce-Castaneda M.V. Kim K.-H. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1049-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25Hillgartner F.B. Charron T. Chesnut K.A. Biochem.

In chickens, diet-induced changes in ACCα abundance have been shown to be mediated by alterations in the rate of transcription (25Hillgartner F.B. Charron T. Chesnut K.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The ACCα gene is transcribed from two promoters, designated PI and PII (27Luo X. Kim K.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4042-4046Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Studies on the physiological regulation of these two promoters indicate that the PII promoter is fairly uniformly expressed in all tissues and does not respond to dietary changes (28Kim T.-S. Leahy P. Freake H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The PI promoter is expressed predominantly in adipose and liver and its utilization is markedly elevated in response to diets inducing lipogenesis (24Lopez-Casellas F. Ponce-Castaneda M.V. Kim K.-H. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1049-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Kim T.-S. Leahy P. Freake H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Hence, the 20-fold increase in ACC mRNA in livers of fasted rats that have been shifted to a high carbohydrate diet (26Kim T.-S. Freake H.C. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) is largely a consequence of PI promoter induction. Studies on the control of the ACCα promoter function have largely focused on the PII promoter to date. Although it is not strongly influenced by dietary status in animals, the PII promoter shows a modest ability (∼3-fold) to respond to glucose/insulin in the 30A5 adipocyte cell line (29Daniel S. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1385-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This regulation has been mapped to a region of the PII promoter between −340 and −249. Within this region, binding sites for both SREBP-1 and Sp1 have been identified as being important (29Daniel S. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1385-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30Lopez J.M. Bennett M.K. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Sp1 binding to the ACCα PII promoter is controlled by glucose through a mechanism involving dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 (31Daniel S. Zhang S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14692-14697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Despite its apparent physiological significance, little is known about the regulation of the ACCα PI promoter. Although an intrinsic repressor element has been described (22Kim K.-H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 77-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), the role of this element in regulation of the PI promoter is unknown. In this study, we examined the control of PI promoter function in primary rat hepatocytes and identified glucose as a major signal controlling its expression. We also identify a glucose responsive sequence in the PI promoter with similarity to the previously characterized ChoRE and demonstrate that this element can bind to ChoRF. Thus, the PI promoter of the ACCα gene is regulated in a manner similar to other lipogenic enzyme genes in response to glucose. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (180–260 g) maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to normal rat chow as described previously (32Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13222-13228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After a 3-h attachment period, cells were transfected with F1 reagent (Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA) in modified Williams' E media containing 23 mmHEPES, 0.01 μm dexamethasone, 0.1 unit/ml insulin, 50 unit/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5.5 mmglucose for 12–14 h. Cells were then cultured in the same media containing either 5.5 or 27.5 mm glucose with or without insulin with an overlay of 0.33 mg/ml Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA). In some experiments, 0.5 μm 3,5,3′-triiodo-l-thyronine was added as indicated in figure legends. After 27 h, cells were harvested for assay of luciferase activity. Luciferase activities are expressed as relative light units measured per microgram of protein. All experiments were repeated three times with duplicate samples for each point and showed identical response patterns. Variation within duplicates is generally less than 20%. A rat genomic P1 library was screened by Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO) using primers recognizing ACCα exon 1. A single positive 85-kilobase clone was obtained. Digestion withBamHI yielded a 12-kilobase subclone including exon 1 and the PI promoter region. PCR was used to generate products of this subclone corresponding to −1049 to +21 or −220 to +21 containing additional BamHI and XhoI restriction sites on their 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. These fragments were cleaved with these restriction enzymes and inserted into the corresponding sites of a modified pGL3 luciferase reporter vector described previously (21Koo S.-H. Dutcher A.K. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9437-9445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The ChoRE mutant of ACC PI promoter (−220/+21) was obtained by inverse PCR as described previously (19Koo S.-H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This mutation introduced a 6-bp sequence that changed nucleotides −109 to −104 from CGTGGG to ATGCAT. Oligonucleotides containing the ACC PI promoter sequence from −126 to −102 were synthesized with additional BamHI andBglII at their 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Oligonucleotides were ligated and a fragment with two copies oriented in a head-to-tail fashion was inserted in the modified pGL3 vector. All other plasmids constructs have been reported previously (21Koo S.-H. Dutcher A.K. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9437-9445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were incubated in 5.5 mm glucose in the absence of insulin for 18 h with an overlay of Matrigel. Cells were then washed and treated with media containing 5.5 or 27.5 mm glucose in the absence or presence of 0.1 unit/ml insulin for 27 h. Total cell RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. RT-PCR reactions were run using the One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using 0.1 μg of RNA. PI- and PII-specific oligonucleotide primers were as described (28Kim T.-S. Leahy P. Freake H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) except that the forward PII-specific primer was changed to 5′-CACACCTCGGCGCAGGGGCTC. For PI-specific primers, reactions were run for 29 cycles with an annealing temperature of 58 °C. For PII-specific primers, reactions were run for 24 cycles using an annealing temperature of 61 °C. As a control, the following ribosomal protein L32-specific primers were used: 5′-AAACTGGCGGAAACCCAGAG and 5′-GCAGCACTTCCAGCTCCTTG. Primers were annealed at a temperature of 58 °C and 24 cycles were used for the PCR. Reaction products were subjected to electrophoresis in 2% low melting point agarose gels and band intensities were compared by imaging of ethidium bromide-stained gels. To quantify PI transcripts, the LightCycler System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) was used. This system allows amplification and detection by fluorescence of PCR products in the same tube using a kinetic approach. RT-PCR reactions were run using SYBR Green I master mix and the same primers as indicated above. Data was acquired as a function of cycle number at a temperature of 82 °C, 1 °C below the melting point for the ACCI PCR product. LightCycler software was used to compare amplification in the experimental samples during the log-linear phase to a standard curve established from a dilution series of control RNA. Nuclear proteins were extracted from livers of rats using the procedure described by Koo and Towle (19Koo S.-H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The fraction that precipitated between 0 and 10% polyethylene glycol 8000 (Hampton Research, Boston, MA) was used for DNA binding experiments. EMSA was carried out under conditions previously described (33Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9380-9387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical reaction contained 100,000 cpm (approximately 6 fmol) of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide with 15 μg of nuclear protein. Nonspecific competitors were 0.1 μg of poly(pI-dC) and 1.9 μg of poly(dA-dT). Following incubation at room temperature for 30 min, samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis. For competition EMSA, the indicated molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added together with radiolabeled probe into the sample prior to incubation. Previous work in one of our laboratories (H. C. F.) used an RT-PCR assay to monitor transcripts from PI and PII promoters in a variety of tissues. These studies demonstrated PI-generated transcripts were elevated in response to feeding a high carbohydrate, low fat diet in the liver, while transcripts from the PII promoter did not respond (28Kim T.-S. Leahy P. Freake H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We wished to verify that this pattern of control can be recapitulated in primary hepatocytes and to examine the contribution of insulin and glucose to the process. Consequently, primary hepatocytes were isolated from rats and cultured under conditions of low glucose (5.5 mm) minus insulin, low glucose plus insulin, high glucose (27.5 mm) minus insulin or high glucose plus insulin for 27 h. RNA was isolated from these hepatocytes and used in an RT-PCR assay with primers that would specifically detect PI or PII transcripts, as described previously (28Kim T.-S. Leahy P. Freake H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, transcripts from the PI promoter are barely detectable in hepatocytes maintained in low glucose media in the absence of insulin. Treatment with insulin in the presence of low glucose caused a significant increase above the basal levels. Likewise, increasing glucose from 5.5 to 27.5 mm in the absence of insulin caused a modest increase in the level of PI-generated transcripts. However, when cells were treated with both high glucose and insulin, a marked induction in PI-generated transcripts was observed. Using a real time RT-PCR system to quantify PI transcripts, increases of 9-, 6.6-, and 48-fold were found in cells treated with insulin alone, high glucose alone, or the combined treatment, respectively, compared with the low glucose minus insulin state. By contrast, PII transcripts were only marginally increased by addition of insulin in low glucose conditions, but no effect of glucose was observed. A control using ribosomal protein L32-specific primers indicated comparable amounts of RNA in each sample. In this experiment, it is not possible to directly compare levels of PI and PII transcripts to each other. However, the results demonstrate that primary hepatocytes are capable of responding to signals of glucose and insulin in a manner similar to the whole animal fed high carbohydrate diet by stimulating production of transcripts from the PI promoter. To determine whether the regulation of PI-generated ACC mRNA is mediated at the transcriptional level, transfection experiments were performed. A segment of the ACC PI gene from −1049 to +21 was initially tested. This segment was fused to a luciferase reporter gene and the resulting construct was introduced into primary hepatocytes. Cells were subsequently maintained in varying glucose and insulin conditions as described above for 27 h, prior to measurement of luciferase activities. The level of reporter gene activity was minimal in cells maintained in low glucose, regardless of whether insulin was present or not (Fig. 2). In contrast, a strong elevation in promoter activity was observed in cells treated with high glucose. Insulin did not increase this level and may, in fact, have caused a modest decrease. By comparison, a fragment from thel-PK promoter from −183 to +12, which was previously shown to be glucose responsive (17Liu Z. Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12787-12795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supported a 5-fold increase in the presence of high glucose, whereas a basal l-PK promoter from −96 to +12 lacking the ChoRE was unresponsive. These experiments indicated that the ACC PI promoter was indeed responsive to glucose in primary hepatocytes and that at least in part the induction of PI-generated mRNA is due to increased transcription. The ACC PI promoter from −1049 to +21 was examined for sequences that might function as a ChoRE. One site was found that matched the previously identified ChoREs from the S14,l-PK, and FAS genes. This sequence contained a direct repeat of the E box half-site 5′-CACG separated by 7 bp (Fig.3). Identical sequence and spacing has recently been shown to support a glucose response of the FAS promoter. 2Rufo, C., Teran-Garcia, M., Nakamura, M., Koo, S.-H., Towle, H. C., and Clarke, S. D. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276,in press. To test the possible significance of this element from the ACC PI promoter, we asked whether ChoRF recognized an oligonucleotide containing this sequence. ChoRF was detected as a gel shift band that formed between rat liver nuclear proteins and various ChoREs (19Koo S.-H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4 A, an oligonucleotide containing the putative ChoRE of the ACC PI promoter (−126/−102) was found to form two major bands on EMSA with rat liver nuclear proteins. The slower migrating and predominant band comigrated with the previously identified ChoRF band observed with l-PK and S14 ChoREs. To confirm that this band is due to binding of the same complex, a competition experiment was performed. An oligonucleotide containing the ChoRE of the l-PK gene was radiolabeled and used as a probe in EMSA. The ability of the putative ACC PI ChoRE to compete for ChoRF binding was assessed. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the ACC oligonucleotide was a strong competitor for ChoRF binding and appeared to compete at least as effectively as thel-PK oligonucleotide itself. ChoRE-containing oligonucleotides from the rat S14 and FAS genes also competed for ChoRF binding, whereas oligonucleotides containing binding sites for SREBP or HNF-4 were ineffective. Hence, the putative ChoRE of the ACC PI promoter is indeed an effective binding site for the ChoRF. To test the functional significance of the putative ChoRE in the ACC PI promoter, we examined the effects of mutating this site. For this experiment, an ACC PI promoter fragment from −220 to +21 was used. As can be seen in Fig. 5, this segment supported a robust response of the ACC PI promoter to glucose, indicating that sequences between −1049 and −220 are not critical for glucose regulation. It should be noted that this deletion removes a DNA sequence reported by others to possess intrinsic repressor activity (22Kim K.-H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 77-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Introduction of a 6-bp mutation that disrupted the putative ChoRE site of the ACC PI promoter resulted in a complete loss of the glucose response of this promoter. Consequently, this site is necessary to support ACC PI promoter activation by glucose. To test also whether this element can function in an independent manner to confer a glucose response, an oligonucleotide containing the putative ChoRE of the ACC PI promoter was linked in two copies to a minimal l-PK promoter containing sequences from −40 to +12. This construct was compared with a series of similarly organized plasmids containing oligonucleotides from other genes. As seen in Fig.6 A, a construct containing the ACC oligonucleotide linked to the minimal l-PK promoter supported a strong response to glucose. Two previously characterized ChoREs from the rat S14 and l-PK genes also supported a glucose response. However, this effect was not observed when a consensus SREBP-binding site was fused to the l-PK minimal promoter. These data indicate that the ChoRE-like sequence of the ACC PI promoter can indeed function as a glucose-responsive sequence in primary hepatocytes and, in fact, in this transfection assay appears to be the strongest ChoRE that we have characterized to date. Given the published data suggesting that SREBP-1c is a major player in response of animals to a high carbohydrate diet, it was of interest to examine whether SREBP-1c was capable of stimulating through the ACC ChoRE site. The same constructs tested above were examined. For this experiment, a vector that drove expression of the nuclear form of SREBP-1c was co-transfected with the various reporter constructs. As can be seen in Fig. 6 B, nuclear SREBP-1c expression resulted in increased reporter activity from a construct containing a consensus SREBP-binding site. However, no effect was observed on the activity of the ACC PI ChoRE-containing construct or on an l-PK ChoRE construct. A modest induction of rat S14ChoRE-containing construct has been observed previously and attributed to the presence of a CACGTG motif in this element (21Koo S.-H. Dutcher A.K. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9437-9445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), a generic binding site for basic/helix-loop-helix factors. These data suggest that SREBP-1c is not the factor responsible for mediating effects of glucose on the ACC PI promoter ChoRE. ACC is generally recognized as the rate-limiting step for fatty acid biosynthesis. Consequently, the enzymatic activity of ACC is tightly controlled by a variety of mechanisms including covalent modification, allosteric control, and alterations in its polymeric state (22Kim K.-H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 77-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 34Hardie D.G. Prog. Lipid Res. 1989; 28: 117-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition, diet and hormonal factors influence the level of ACC production (22Kim K.-H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 77-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In this regard, ACC is a member of a family of lipogenic enzymes that are induced under conditions favoring energy storage and repressed under conditions of energy demand. The ACCα gene is expressed from two promoters and variably spliced to include or exclude alternative exons within the 5′-untranslated region (27Luo X. Kim K.-H. Proc. Natl."
https://openalex.org/W2089480351,"Several cell functions related to growth and survival regulation have been attributed specifically to the membrane form of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (proHB-EGF), rather than to the diffusible, processed HB-EGF isoform. These findings suggest the existence of a functional binding partner specifically for the membrane form of the growth factor. In this study we have identified the prosurvival cochaperone, BAG-1, as a protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic tail domain of proHB-EGF. Interaction between BAG-1 and the 24-amino acid proHB-EGF cytoplasmic tail was initially identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen and was confirmed in mammalian cells. The proHB-EGF tail bound BAG-1 in an hsp70-independent manner and within a 97-amino acid segment that includes the ubiquitin homology domain in BAG-1 but does not include the hsp70 binding site. Effects of BAG-1 and proHB-EGF co-expression were demonstrated in cell adhesion and cell survival assays and in quantitative assays of regulated secretion of soluble HB-EGF. Because the BAG-1 binding site is not present on the mature, diffusible form of the growth factor, these findings suggest a new mechanism by which proHB-EGF, in isolation from the diffusible form, can mediate cell signaling events.

An interesting property of the membrane-anchored forms of the EGF-like factors is that they can be biologically active while still tethered to the membrane (1Anklesaria P. Teixido J. Laiho M.

This property has been termed juxtacrine signaling, as distinct from autocrine or paracrine signaling, which requires processed forms of the growth factors to diffuse from the cell and mediate receptor activation. Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a direct activating ligand for the EGF receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) and the related tyrosine kinase, ErbB4 (reviewed in Ref. 4Raab G. Klagsbrun M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F179-99PubMed Google Scholar). HB-EGF gene expression and protein synthesis are up-regulated in response to cell stress, consistent with a cytoprotective function for the molecule. The secreted form of HB-EGF is proteolytically processed from a membrane-anchored precursor, proHB-EGF, expressed by many epithelial, fibromuscular, and other cell types. Membrane proHB-EGF has been demonstrated to exhibit a variety of biological activities, including stimulation of DNA synthesis, enhanced intercellular adhesion (2Raab G. Kover K. Paria B.C. Dey S.K.

In this study we report that the cytoplasmic tail of proHB-EGF interacts with BAG-1, a multifunctional protein first identified as a binding partner of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (11Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). BAG-1 associates with several signaling molecules and is capable of suppressing apoptosis. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism through which proHB-EGF might mediate physiological processes related to growth, adhesion, and cell survival. LexA-based yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described (12Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12980-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), using a constitutively expressed proHB-EGF-tail bait fusion and a galactose inducible prey-fusion library. A DNA fragment encoding the intracellular domain of human HB-EGF (amino acids 185–208) was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primer pairs: 5′-CTCGAATTCAGGTACCATAGGAGAGGAGGT-3′ and 5′-TCTCTCGAGGTGGGAATTAGTCATGCCCAA-3′. The fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the vector pEG202, such that the HB-EGF cytoplasmic tail fragment was in frame with the LexA DNA binding domain. Intrinsic transcription activation activity of the bait plasmid pLexA-HB-EGF-tail was negligible. The cDNA library used for screening, a gift from Dr. Russell Finley, Jr., was generated from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from a human prostate carcinoma (LNCaP) xenograft grown in an athymic mouse host. Potential interactors were screened by auxotrophic selection on plates supplemented with galactose or glucose, but lacking histidine, uracil, tryptophan, and leucine (Gal/-HUTL or Glu/-HUTL), and for the ability to metabolize X-Gal on Gal/X-gal/-HUT or Glu/X-gal/-HUT plates. Positive colonies grew on Gal/-HUTL plates and also appeared blue on Gal/X-gal/-HUT plates. The GST-HB-EGF tail fusion construct was generated by ligating an EcoRI-XhoI HB-EGF tail PCR product into pGEX-4T1(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST-BAG-1 fusion construct was generated by excising a DNA fragment encoding the 219-amino acid form of mouse BAG-1 from the prey plasmid pJG45-mBAG-1 (clone B11), using EcoRI and XhoI, and cloned into pGEX-4T1. N-and C-terminally truncated variants of the GST-BAG-1 fusion construct were generated by PCR from pJG45-mBAG-1 using the following primers: GST-BAG1 (ΔC), 5′-CAGACCGAATTCATGGCCAAGACCG-3′ and 5′-CTTCCTCGAGATTGCTCTTTT-3′; GST-BAG-1 (ΔN), 5′-TCCAGAATTCGAGGTTGAGTT-3′ and 5′-GACAAGCCGACAACCTTGATTGGAG-3′. PCR was performed using a high fidelity Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and products were subcloned into pGEX-4T1 and sequenced. All GST fusion proteins were purified as described (11Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins pull-down assay was employed as described (11Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). BAG-1-enriched lysates were generated from COS7 cells overexpressing recombinant BAG-1 or from the human prostate carcinoma cell lines, LNCaP and PC-3, in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). HB-EGF-enriched lysates from transfected cells were prepared in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates (∼500 µg total protein) were incubated with 5 µg of GST fusion proteins. BAG-1 was detected with the following antibodies: anti-human BAG-1 (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA), anti-BAG-1/RAP46/HAP1 (Neomarkers, Union City, CA) and/or anti-BAG-1 (clone 4A2, MBL, Nagoya, Japan). Anti-alkaline phosphatase (AP) antibody (Ab) (anti-human placental AP) was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA) and anti-hsp70/hsc70 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Far-Western blotting was modified from the filter binding assay as described (11Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 µg each GST and GST-HB-EGF-(185–208) were size-fractionated with 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane. Membranes were preblocked by 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100 containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the same solution containing 1 mm AEBSF, 3% bovine serum albumin, 1% (v/v) lysate from pcDNA3.1/BAG-1-transfected COS7 cells. Bound BAG-1 on the membrane was detected with anti-BAG-1 monoclonal Ab (MBL) immunoblotting and visualized by ECL (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). LNCaP and PC-3 cells were grown in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum. CHO-K1 cells were cultured in F12K, 10% fetal bovine serum. NRK52E and COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. MC2 cells were cultured in T medium as described (13Dethlefsen S.M. Raab G. Moses M.A. Adam R.M. Klagsbrun M. Freeman M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2at 37 °C. The proHB-EGF-AP fusion construct (pRc/CMV-proHB-EGF-AP) and the tail-less form of this construct (pRc/CMV-proHB-EGF (Δtail)-AP) have been described (13Dethlefsen S.M. Raab G. Moses M.A. Adam R.M. Klagsbrun M. Freeman M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment encoding BAG-1 was excised from pJG45-mBAG-1 (clone B11) and subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of either pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (+) or pcDNA6/His (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using standard protocols. NRK52E cells expressing proHB-EGF or the tail-less form of proHB-EGF were created by transfecting cells with the plasmids described above using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Double-stable (HB-EGF+BAG-1) CHO transfectants were generated as in Ref. 11Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar. Initially cells were transfected with pRc/CMV-proHB-EGF-AP or with the empty vector and selected in G418-containing medium. Each population was then transfected with either pcDNA6/His-BAG-1 or the control vector, pcDNA6/His-LacZ and stable transfectants were selected by blasticidin (Invitrogen). MC2-proHB-EGF-AP and MC2-proHB-EGF(Δtail)-AP cloned cells have been described (13Dethlefsen S.M. Raab G. Moses M.A. Adam R.M. Klagsbrun M. Freeman M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and were double transfected by pcDNA6/His-BAG-1 or pcDNA6/His-LacZ as above. Cell populations were selected and maintained in medium supplemented with 300 µg/ml G418 and/or 5 µg/ml blasticidin. MTT and DNA fragmentation assays were performed as described (14Bardelli A. Longati P. Albero D. Goruppi S. Schneider C. Ponzetto C. Comoglio P.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6205-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 15Lin J. Adam R.M. Santiestevan E. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2891-2897PubMed Google Scholar). BAG-1-transfected MC2-proHB-EGF-AP cells were either treated or untreated by 0.4 mm etoposide for 24 h, and cells were fixed with incubation with 2% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. Cell permeabilization was performed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min on ice. Cells were washed with PBS, blocked for 30 min with PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.075% glycine (blocking buffer) and incubated with anti-AP monoclonal Ab (8B6, Sigma) (1:250) and rabbit polyclonal anti-BAG-1 antibody (1:1000) (N20, Santa Cruz) diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with blocking buffer, cells were incubated with Texas-red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc. West Grove, PA) for 45 min. Slides were washed extensively with blocking buffer prior to mounting and were viewed using a Bio-Rad 1024 Laser Scanning Confocal Imaging System. Up to forty serial optical sections (∼0.5 µm section thickness) were collected on informative cells. Individual channels of double labeled cells were collected as two separate series and merged in Confocal Assistant (written by Todd Breljie). Secretion of HB-EGF was measured by determining levels of alkaline phosphatase (AP) in the medium using cells expressing proHB-EGF-AP fusion proteins as described previously (13Dethlefsen S.M. Raab G. Moses M.A. Adam R.M. Klagsbrun M. Freeman M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40,000 cells/well were seeded in 24-well plates and 24 h later, cells were stimulated by etoposide at the different concentrations under serum-free conditions. Medium was collected 24 h later and AP activity was measured spectrophotometrically. Data were compared using a paired Student's t test. p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. The 24-residue cytoplasmic tail of proHB-EGF exhibits a high degree of interspecies sequence conservation (95% amino acid identity between mouse and human), suggesting an important functional role for this region of the protein. In a previous study, proHB-EGF was shown to protect NRK52E renal epithelial cells from apoptosis induced by H2O2 or etoposide treatment (9Takemura T. Kondo S. Homma T. Sakai M. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31036-31042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Soluble HB-EGF was not able to replicate this cytoprotective effect. To determine whether the proHB-EGF tail is involved in this process, NRK52E cells were transfected with intact proHB-EGF or proHB-EGF tail-deleted expression constructs. Cells expressing the two forms of the protein were then challenged with etoposide or H2O2. NRK52E cells expressing the proHB-EGF construct exhibited less apoptosis than vector-only control cells (Fig.1), consistent with findings reported by Takemura et al. (9Takemura T. Kondo S. Homma T. Sakai M. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31036-31042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast, cells expressing the tail-deleted construct exhibited a similar level of apoptosis to the vector-only cells, suggesting a role for the tail domain in cytoprotection from apoptosis inducers. These observations led us to search for proteins that interact with the proHB-EGF cytoplasmic domain. We screened a yeast two-hybrid expression library, constructed from a human prostate (LNCaP) xenograft tumor growing in a mouse host, with the proHB-EGF tail domain (amino acids 185–208), using a LexA-based system. Approximately 106 independent clones were screened. From the 6 strongest potential interactors identified in the screen, two clones, pJG45-B11 and pJG45-E68 (Fig. 2 A), each contained the entire open reading frame of the short form of the mouse protein, BAG-1 (219 amino acids, expected molecular size: 24.5 kDa) (11Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). These two clones are identical but were derived from two independent yeast transformations. In follow-up experiments, BAG-1 and the HB-EGF tail also interacted in the yeast two-hybrid system when the cDNAs were switched into the opposite (prey<->bait) plasmid vectors. To confirm the association between BAG-1 and HB-EGF, a GST fusion protein containing the HB-EGF cytoplasmic tail (GST-HB-EGF-(185–208)) was constructed and used in pull-down assays. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding mouse BAG-1. Lysates from these cells or from LNCaP cells (to test for binding with the native/endogenous, human form of BAG-1) were incubated with purified GST-HB-EGF-(185–208). A complex was formed between GST-HB-EGF-(185–208) and BAG-1 but not between BAG-1 and GST alone (Fig. 2 B). The converse experiment was also performed with a GST-BAG-1 fusion protein using lysates from cells expressing AP-tagged proHB-EGF. In these experiments, a complex was formed between proHB-EGF and GST-BAG-1, but not between proHB-EGF and GST, or between GST-BAG-1 and proHB-EGF in which the tail domain was deleted (Fig.2 C). Complex formation between BAG-1 and the proHB-EGF tail was also demonstrated by Far-Western blot, in which the HB-EGF tail was immobilized, and the interaction occurred on blotting membranes instead of in solution (Fig. 2 D). The 219 amino acid form of BAG-1 identified in the screen contains a ubiquitin homology domain (residues 37–73) and a central region (residues 90–172) that binds to Bcl-2 (11Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Its carboxyl-terminal domain is required for direct interaction with the ATPase domain of hsp70 heat shock protein (16Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We generated a GST-BAG-1(ΔC) construct (residues 1–97), containing the ubiquitin homology region, and GST-BAG-1 (ΔN) (residues 100–219), which carries binding sites for most of the known BAG-1 interactors. Complex formation with proHB-EGF was observed with GST-BAG-1 and GST-BAG-1(ΔC), but not with GST-BAG-1(ΔN). Complex formation did occur, however, between GST-BAG-1(ΔN) and hsp70 (Fig. 2 E), demonstrating the capability of GST-BAG-1(ΔN) to bind to a known BAG-1-binding protein despite its failure to bind to proHB-EGF. This result also indicates that the BAG-1 interaction with proHB-EGF is not mediated by hsp70, and it rules out the possibility that aberrant-folding of GST-BAG-1(ΔN) is the reason for the absence of binding to HB-EGF. In a reciprocal experiment, GST-HB-EGF-(185–208) was also able to form a complex with endogenous BAG-1 (33–35 kDa) and endogenous hsp70 from human (LNCaP) cells (Fig. 2 F). We also investigated the dynamics of the BAG-1/HB-EGF tail interaction in cells induced to undergo apoptosis. LNCaP cells were treated with wortmannin, a PI3-kinase inhibitor that rapidly induces apoptosis in this cell line (15Lin J. Adam R.M. Santiestevan E. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2891-2897PubMed Google Scholar), and lysates were used in pull-down experiments. Interestingly, complex formation between the HB-EGF tail and endogenous BAG-1 diminished in a time-dependent manner following wortmannin treatment (Fig. 2 G). Similar results were obtained when wortmannin-insensitive PC-3 cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor (data not shown). These results suggest that the BAG-1/proHB-EGF interaction is not favored when cells undergo programmed cell death. Taken together, these experiments: 1) demonstrated a direct interaction between BAG-1 and the proHB-EGF cytoplasmic domain, 2) localized the HB-EGF-interacting domain to within residues 1–97 of BAG-1, and 3) also revealed that BAG-1 can form a ternary complex with both proHB-EGF and hsp70 through interactions with these proteins at distinct binding sites. To explore the possibility of a functional interaction between proHB-EGF and BAG-1, CHO cell populations were engineered sequentially to stably express either BAG-1, proHB-EGF, or both proteins. BAG-1+proHB-EGF-expressing cells exhibited a more epithelial-like cellular morphology, in comparison to cells expressing either BAG-1 or proHB-EGF alone or control vectors, or the parent cell, all of which exhibited a more fibroblastic appearance (Fig.3). These data suggest that coexpression of both proteins confers functional properties on transfected cells that are not seen when each protein is expressed separately. A similar requirement for proHB-EGF and BAG-1 co-expression to change a cellular phenotype was observed in other assays. BAG-1+proHB-EGF-expressing cells exhibited quantitatively reduced cell adhesion, as measured by sensitivity to trypsin/EDTA treatment, in comparison to cells expressing either BAG-1 or proHB-EGF or control plasmids (Fig. 4 A). The presence of BAG-1 with proHB-EGF in CHO cell transformants also affected the sensitivity of these cells to certain apoptotic stimuli. BAG-1+proHB-EGF cells demonstrated increased resistance to apoptosis induced by etoposide, a topoisomerase inhibitor, in comparison to cells expressing either BAG-1 or proHB-EGF alone (Fig. 4 B). This resistance to apoptosis induction appeared to be confined to specific survival pathways, however, because BAG-1+proHB-EGF cells did not show synergistic protective effects when apoptosis was induced by staurosporine (data not shown). We also compared secretion of soluble HB-EGF in response to apoptotic stimuli in proHB-EGF-and proHB-EGF(Δtail)-expressing MC2 cells transfected with BAG-1 and vector only. Etoposide treatment induced rapid secretion of soluble HB-EGF in cells expressing transfected BAG-1 but not in cells transfected with an empty vector (Fig.5 A). In contrast, in cells expressing a tail-deleted form of proHB-EGF, transfection with BAG-1 did not alter the secretion response to etoposide. EGFR levels in proHB-EGF- and proHB-EGF(Δtail)-expressing cells were equivalent (Fig. 5 B), indicating that differential capture of the soluble HB-EGF ligand by the EGFR cannot account for the observed differences in the secretion response. Similar results were observed in the CHO cell background (data not shown). These data suggest that the proHB-EGF tail is involved in regulated processing of the cell-associated form of the growth factor to the soluble form and that BAG-1 is capable of modulating this process in a manner that is dependent on the presence of the tail domain. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy indicated that proHB-EGF and BAG-1 co-localized within cytoplasm vesicles and at the plasma membrane, consistent with the possibility that BAG-1 can affect trafficking and maturation of soluble HB-EGF (Fig.6). BAG-1 and proHB-EGF colocalized sites diminished in frequency when cells were treated with etoposide. The results of this study demonstrate that the membrane form of HB-EGF interacts with the anti-apoptotic protein, BAG-1, and that this interaction is likely to have functional significance. The BAG-1/HB-EGF tail interaction was demonstrated in a number of independent assays, including yeast two-hybrid, GST-pull-down, and Far-Western blot methods. Evidence for colocalization of BAG-1 and proHB-EGF was also obtained with immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. In addition, cooperative effects of BAG-1 and proHB-EGF expression were observed in assays of cell adhesion, apoptosis, and growth factor secretion. Consistent with these findings, we found that deletion of the proHB-EGF tail diminished the growth factor's cytoprotective function and resulted in the loss of the ability of etoposide to induce HB-EGF secretion, results that point to an important role for the tail region. The diverse effects of proHB-EGF and BAG-1 coexpression indicate that the BAG-1/HB-EGF interaction may impinge on a number of discrete signaling pathways. Further, because we were able to demonstrate effects of BAG-1 expression on secretion of soluble HB-EGF, this interaction may regulate physiological activities of both the processed as well as the membrane-anchored forms of the growth factor. Importantly, our results suggest a novel mechanism whereby the membrane-anchored form of HB-EGF might alter cell function independently of the soluble form of the molecule. BAG-1 was originally identified as a Bcl-2-binding protein but is now known to interact with and regulate a number of signaling proteins. Because the proHB-EGF tail and membrane-anchoring domains are removed from the mature growth factor by proteolytic cleavage, these results provide the first unambiguous mechanism whereby the HB-EGF pro-form could mediate processes distinct from those conferred by processed HB-EGF. Several previous studies have identified bioactivities solely attributable to proHB-EGF, although the reason for the distinction between the precursor and secreted forms is not clear because both proteins presumably function principally by activating identical high-affinity receptor tyrosine kinases. Interactions between proHB-EGF and several cell surface molecules have been identified previously, including interactions with CD9/DRAP27, a tetraspanin membrane protein, the α3β1 integrin, and heparan-sulfated glycosaminoglycans, by mechanisms that are dependent on the proHB-EGF ectodomain (3Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 8Nakamura K. Iwamoto R. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1691-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 17Shi W. Fan H. Shum L. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, BAG-1 is the first protein to be identified that interacts with the proHB-EGF cytoplasmic domain in an ectodomain-independent manner. Because CHO cells express low or negligible EGFR levels (18Livneh E. Prywes R. Kashles O. Reiss N. Sasson I. Mory Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12490-12497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our observations also suggest the interesting possibility, although this was not formally tested in the present study, that the cooperative effects we observed between proHB-EGF and BAG-1 do not require the EGFR. Receptor-independent signaling by proHB-EGF may be related to cell-cell adhesive functions previously noted for this growth factor (2Raab G. Kover K. Paria B.C. Dey S.K. Ezzell R.M. Klagsbrun M. Development. 1996; 122: 637-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nakamura K. Iwamoto R. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1691-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). BAG-1 is an important regulatory protein that has been shown to have a variety of binding partners and a range of bioactivities, including protection from apoptotic signals (11Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 19Takaoka A. Adachi M. Okuda H. Sato S. Yawata A. Hinoda Y.

Reed J.C. Hinoda Y. Imai K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3244-3251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and regulation of transcription (21Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 10194-10199Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). BAG-1 has been reported to bind the cytoplasmic domain of the HGF receptor (14Bardelli A. Longati P. Albero D. Goruppi S. Schneider C. Ponzetto C. Comoglio P.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6205-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), the Raf-1 kinase (23Wang H.G. Takayama S. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7063-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and several members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily (21Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11660-11666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24Schneikert J. Hubner S. Martin E. Cato A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and to be capable of altering the activity of these molecules. Multiple BAG-1 isoforms, with differing patterns of cellular localization, arise by alternate translation initiation. Human BAG-1L (57 kDa), for example, is a nuclear as well as a cytosolic protein, whereas the “small” BAG-1 isoforms studied here (29–36 kDa) are predominantly cytosolic (25Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3116-3131PubMed Google Scholar). Like HB-EGF, the BAG-1 proteins appear to have an important function in stress-regulated signaling. Enforced BAG-1 expression can promote cell survival independently of effects on cell proliferation, motility, and invasive properties (19Takaoka A. Adachi M. Okuda H. Sato S. Yawata A. Hinoda Y. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Imai K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2971-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), suggesting that effects on cell survival signaling are distinct from mechanisms of cell growth or cell cycle transit. In a similar fashion to our results, anti-apoptotic effects of BAG-1 can be enhanced by coexpression of BAG-1 binding proteins, such as Bcl-2 (11Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 26Schulz J.B. Bremen D. Reed J.C. Lommatzsch J. Takayama S. Wullner U. Loschmann P.A. Klockgether T. Weller M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2075-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). From these and other data, a critical role for BAG-1 in cell signaling related to cell survival mechanisms, but also to other processes, can be inferred despite uncertainty as to its precise mechanism of action. The heat shock protein, hsp70, has been reported to be a favored BAG-1 interactor. In this case, BAG-1 appears to function as a regulator of protein-folding and/or trafficking by acting as a competitive antagonist of the cochaperone, Hip (27Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 781-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Although a number of proteins are thought to associate with BAG-1 because of its ability to bind hsp70 (16Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we demonstrate in this study that proHB-EGF binds to a C-terminal deletion mutant of BAG-1, which does not bind hsp70 and that the HB-EGF interaction site on BAG-1 is distinct from the hsp70 interaction site. Furthermore, the HB-EGF tail-BAG-1 interaction occurs in yeast and yeast hsp70 is not a BAG-1 binding partner (16Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that proHB-EGF and BAG-1 interact directly and in an hsp70-independent manner. This finding suggests that interaction of BAG-1 with proHB-EGF, and possibly with other regulatory proteins, may be functionally distinct from its role as a cochaperone in mechanisms of protein-folding and/or stabilization. BAG-1 is one of only a handful of proteins demonstrated to interact with the tail domains of membrane-bound EGF-like growth factors. TACIP18/syntenin and αA1 syntrophin were recently identified as specific interactors with the tail domain of proTGFα (28Fernandez-Larrea J. Merlos-Suarez A. Urena J.M. Baselga J. Arribas J. Mol Cell. 1999; 3: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). TACIP18/syntenin appears to be involved in intracellular trafficking of TGFα. LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) was identified as an interactor with the tail domain of neuregulins and to co-localize with neuregulins at the neuromuscular synapse (29Wang J.Y. Frenzel K.E. Wen D. Falls D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20525-20534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). LIMK1 does not interact with the proTGFα tail, suggesting that the cytoplasmic partners of membrane EGF-like growth factors are likely to play specialized roles. This hypothesis is consistent with the fact that ErbB1 ligands, despite similar receptor binding affinity to their primary receptor(s), do not show identical patterns of receptor transactivation or similar patterns of intracellular localization of their membrane forms and thus are functionally specialized. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that the prosurvival protein, BAG-1, is a functional binding partner of the membrane form of the receptor tyrosine kinase ligand, HB-EGF. This interaction could credibly alter aspects of cell signaling relating to unique functions of both the membrane as well as the soluble HB-EGF isoforms. We thank Drs. R. Adam and J.

Cell death is required during the development of an organism to remove portions of the body that will not be needed; this cell death usually requires destructive enzymes called caspases to perform the final demolition of the cell. But cavitation, an early developmental process in the mouse embryo that requires cell death, has now been suggested to occur through a caspase-independent pathway that instead uses a mitochondrial protein called AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor)."

To uncover the regulatory properties of the general transcription machinery, we have isolated thehTAF II 55 gene and dissected the regulatory elements and the core promoter responsible forhTAF II 55 gene expression. Surprisingly, the hTAF II 55 gene has a single uninterrupted open reading frame and is the only intronless general transcription factor identified so far. Its expression is driven by a TATA-less promoter that contains a functional initiator and a downstream promoter element, as illustrated by both transfection assays and mutational analyses. Moreover, this core promoter can mediate the activity of a transcriptional activator that is artificially recruited to the promoter in a heterologous context. Interestingly, in the promoter-proximal region there are multiple Sp1-binding sites juxtaposed to a single AP2-binding site, indicating that Sp1 and AP2 may regulate the core promoter activity of thehTAF II 55 gene. These findings indicate that a combinatorial regulation of a general transcription factor-encoding gene can be conferred by both ubiquitous and cell type-specific transcriptional regulators.AF349038 Human TAFII55 (hTAFII55) is a component of the multisubunit general transcription factor TFIID and has been shown to mediate the functions of many transcriptional activators via direct protein-protein interactions.

The TATA box is an A/T-rich sequence located ∼25–30 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site. It contains a consensus sequence, TATA(A/T)A(A/T), whose recognition by the TATA-binding protein (TBP)1 subunit of TFIID nucleates the formation of a preinitiation complex (1Breathnach R. Chambon P.

A second core promoter element, the initiator (Inr), contains a pyrimidine (Y)-rich core sequence, YYA+1N(T/A)YY, surrounding the transcription start site (4Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The Inr is capable of directing accurate transcription initiation either alone or in conjunction with a TATA box or other core promoter elements (5Smale S.T. Baltimore D.

However, the nucleation pathways of these Inr-targeting proteins have not yet been defined. The downstream promoter element (DPE), which is located 28–34 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start site in manyDrosophila TATA-less promoters (9Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 10Kutach A.K. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4754-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 24Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), has a consensus sequence, (A/G)G(A/T)CGTG, and can be recognized by the dTAFII60 and dTAFII40 components ofDrosophila TFIID (9Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 24Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that TFIID is likely to be the DPE-binding factor. Interestingly, negative cofactor 2 (NC2 or Dr1-Drap1), initially characterized as a TBP-inhibitory activity on a TATA-containing promoter (25Meisterernst M. Roeder R.G.

Science. 2000; 290: 982-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It seems that TFIID and NC2, two of the DPE-acting factors, may work synergistically through the DPE, although their functional relationship remains to be elucidated. Another upstream core promoter element, (G/C)(G/C)(G/A)CGCC, was identified through binding site selection as a GC-rich sequence recognized by TFIIB (30Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This TFIIB recognition element (BRE) is located immediately upstream of the TATA box and can be used to modulate preinitiation complex assembly in eukaryotic cells (30Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) as well as in Archaea (31Qureshi S.A. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 389-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Analysis of the promoter database reveals that 57% of theDrosophila core promoters do not contain a TATA box, and the DPE occurs in ∼40% of the Drosophila promoters (10Kutach A.K. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4754-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Although such statistical data are not yet available for the human genome, it appears that the promoters of human housekeeping genes, oncogenes, growth factors, and transcription factors often lack a TATA box (32Zhang M.Q. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, many natural promoters contain distinct combinations of core promoter elements whose differential utilization plays an important role in regulating gene expression in a spatial, temporal, or lineage-specific manner (13Hansen S.K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 82: 565-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 34Ren B. Maniatis T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1076-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Human TAFII55 (hTAFII55) was first identified as an RNA polymerase II-specific TBP-associated factor (TAFII) in TFIID (35Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 36Lavigne A.-C. Mengus G. May M. Dubrovskaya V. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19774-19780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and, like many other TAFIIs, was also detected in the TBP-free-TAFII-containing complex (37Wieczorek E. Brand M. Jacq X. Tora L. Nature. 1998; 393: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, TAFII55 is not present in some other TAFII-containing complexes, such as human PCAF (38Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schlitz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.-J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and yeast SAGA complexes (39Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Pray-Grant M.G. Steger D.J. Reese J.C. Yates J.R. Workman J.L. Cell. 1998; 94: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), suggesting that TAFII55 has unique properties distinct from its role as a structural component of TFIID and of TBP-free-TAFII-containing complex. This idea is further substantiated by the finding that TAFII55 can interact with many transcription factors, including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenovirus E1A, and HIV-1 Tat (35Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and can also mediate vitamin D3 and thyroid hormone receptor activation in a ligand-independent manner (40Lavigne A.-C. Mengus G. Gangloff Y.-G. Wurtz J.-M. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5486-5494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with a coactivator role of TAFII55 in transcriptional regulation. Moreover, TAFII55 may be implicated in mRNA 3′ end processing, as it shows strong affinity toward the human cleavage-polyadenylation specificity factor (41Dantonel J.-C. Murthy K.G. Manley J.L. Tora L. Nature. 1997; 389: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). TAFII55 homologues have also been identified in several organisms. The mouse homologue, mTAFII55, is 95% identical to its human counterpart (42Wu S.-Y. Thomas M.C. Hou S.Y. Likhite V. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23480-23490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue, yTaf67, is essential for cellular viability 2S.-Y. Wu and C.-M. Chiang, unpublished data. 2S.-Y. Wu and C.-M. Chiang, unpublished data. (43Moqtaderi Z. Yale J.D. Struhl K. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14654-14658Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recently, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologue of yTaf67, Ptr6p (poly(A)+ RNA transport), was shown to be involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport of mRNAs during a genetic screen for mutants that accumulate mRNAs in the nucleus (44Shibuya T. Tsuneyoshi S. Azad A.K. Urushiyama S. Ohshima Y. Tani T. Genetics. 1999; 152: 869-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, proteins that share high sequence homology with hTAFII55 have also been identified in Caenorhabditis elegans(GenBankTM accession number Z67755) and Drosophila melanogaster (GenBankTM accession number AF017096). The chromosomal location of the hTAF II 55gene has been mapped to 5q31, where chromosomal mutations have been associated with stomach adenocarcinoma (45Purrello M. Di Pietro C. Viola A. Rapisarda A. Stevens S. Guermah M. Tao Y. Bonaiuto C. Arcidiacono A. Messina A. Sichel G. Grzeschik K.-H. Roeder R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggesting thathTAF II 55 or other genes localized in this region may act as an oncogene. Interestingly, Northern blot analysis showed that hTAFII55 is differentially expressed in various human tissues. 3C.-M. Chiang, unpublished data. 3C.-M. Chiang, unpublished data. In addition, we observed that in a HeLa-derived cell line that conditionally expresses FLAG-tagged hTAFII55, the overall level of the induced tagged protein and the endogenous untagged hTAFII55 protein remains constant (46Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This indicates a tight regulation overhTAF II 55 expression in vivo. In order to understand the regulation ofhTAF II 55 gene expression and to gain further insight into the regulatory pathways of general transcription factor-encoding genes, we dissected the cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors that regulate the expression of thehTAF II 55 gene. Our studies indicate thathTAF II 55 gene expression is combinatorially regulated by both ubiquitous and cell type-specific transcription factors. Moreover, we have characterized the core promoter elements of the hTAF II 55 gene, which surprisingly contains a single uninterrupted open reading frame whose expression is driven by a TATA-deficient promoter with a functional initiator and a DPE. Collectively, these findings uncover unusual features of hTAF II 55 gene structure and regulatory properties that are significantly different from other general transcription factor-encoding genes. A human genomic library, derived from the HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line and cloned in the λ-DASH II vector (Stratagene), was screened with a32P-labeled DNA fragment spanning the first 474 nucleotides (cut between the HpaI andEcoRI sites) of the hTAFII55 cDNA (35Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). From ∼1 × 106 plaque-forming units, 12 positive clones were isolated. The inserts were individually cloned into theNotI site of pBS-SK (+) (Stratagene). A clone, pBS/3′-8, which contains an insert of ∼17 kb, including regions 5′ and 3′ ofhTAFII55, was manually sequenced (GenBankTM accession number AF349038). A 1459-bp genomic DNA fragment that extends 1436 bp upstream and 23 bp downstream of the 5′ end of the hTAFII55 cDNA (35Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from pBS/3′-8 using an upstream KpnI site-containing primer (5′ CATTCTGGTACCAGGCACTGGGACAC 3′) and a downstream BglII site-containing primer (5′ AGCGCGAGATCTTGCCGAGAGG 3′). The amplified DNA fragment was then cloned into pGL2-Basic (Promega) between the KpnI andBglII sites. The resulting construct was denoted pGL2-TAF55(−1372/+87). A series of hTAF II 55 promoter deletion constructs, including pGL2-TAF55(−128/+87), pGL2-TAF55(−99/+87), pGL2-TAF55(−71/+87), pGL2-TAF55(−55/+87), pGL2-TAF55(−26/+87), pGL2-TAF55(−128/+36), pGL2-TAF55(−71/+36), pGL2-TAF55(−55/+36), and pGL2-TAF55(−26/+36) were similarly made in pGL2-Basic by using primer pairs with introduced KpnI and BglII sites at their 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The numbers in the deletion constructs indicate the boundaries of the inserts relative to the transcription start site. The plasmids pGL2-TAF55(−748/+87) and pGL2-TAF55(−281/+87) were created by first cleaving pGL2-TAF55(−1372/+87) with ScaI or XbaI, filling in the XbaI-digested end with Klenow enzyme, and releasing the inserts with BglII. The promoter-containing fragments were then cloned into pGL2-Basic between the BglII site and the Klenow- filled-in XhoI site to generate pGL2-TAF55(−748/+87) and pGL2-TAF55(−281/+87), respectively. The plasmid pGL2-TAF55(−161/+87) was generated by cloning a PCR fragment, amplified with an upstream primer spanning −161 to −144 and the same downstream BglII site-containing primer ending at +87, between the BglII site and the Klenow-filled-in XhoI site of pGL2-Basic. Similarly, the plasmid pGL2-TAF55(−1372/−140) was made by inserting a PCR fragment, amplified with the same upstream KpnI site-containing primer ending at −1372 and a downstream primer spanning −157 to −140, between the KpnI site and the Klenow-filled-inXhoI site of pGL2-Basic. Promoter constructs containing nucleotide substitutions in the sequence motifs of Sp1, AP2, Inr, and DPE (denoted by asterisks) were individually generated by PCR amplification with primer pairs spanning the mutated nucleotides according to the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). The plasmids pGL2-TAF55(−71/+36)Sp1*-60, pGL2-TAF55(−71/+36)AP2*, pGL2-TAF-55(−71/+36)Sp1*-60/AP2*, pGL2-TAF55(−71/+36)Sp1*-20, pGL2-TAF55(−26/+36)Inr*, pGL2-TAF55(−26/+36)DPE*, and pGL2-TAF55(−26/+36)Inr*DPE* were constructed in the backbone of pGL2-TAF55(−71/+36) or pGL2-TAF55(−26/+36) using primer pairs containing the introduced mutations as shown in Figs. 4B and5A. For five Gal4-binding site-containing constructs, theSacI-PstI fragment of pG5HMC2AT (47Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) with 5 Gal4-binding sites was first cloned into pBS-SK(+) between SacI and PstI sites to generate pBS-5Gal, from which theSmaI-KpnI fragment was isolated and cloned into pGL2-TAF55(−26/+36), pGL2-TAF55(−26/+36)Inr*, pGL2-TAF55(−26/+36)DPE*, pGL2-TAF55(−26/+36)Inr*DPE*, and pGL2-Basic at the same enzyme-cutting sites to create pGL2–5Gal(−26/+36)WT, pGL2–5Gal(−26/+36)Inr*, pGL2–5Gal(−26/+36)DPE*, pGL2–5Gal(−26/+36)Inr*DPE*, and pGL2–5Gal, respectively. All constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing.Figure 5Inr and DPE are both important core promoter elements for hTAF II 55 gene expression.A, mutations at the Inr and the DPE reducehTAF II 55 promoter activity. Transient transfection and reporter gene assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using plasmids containing either wild-type or mutated nucleotides at the Inr and/or the DPE of thehTAF II 55 promoter fragment spanning −26 to +36. The pGL2-Basic plasmid (vector) containing no insert was also used for transfection as control. Luciferase activity was normalized to that of the wild-type promoter construct, pGL2-TAF55(−26/+36), and presented in the bar graph witherror bars showing standard deviation. Asterisksand × indicate mutations introduced at specific protein-binding motifs in the plasmids. The nucleotides changed in each motifs are denoted at the bottom. B, the Inr and DPE modules of the hTAF II 55 core promoter can mediate transcriptional activation in a heterologous promoter context. Transient transfection was performed in C-33A cells by cotransfecting different amounts of the Gal4-VP16-expressing plasmid (pSGVP), together with either wild-type (WT) or mutated reporter constructs driven by 5 Gal4-binding sites as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The HIV-1 promoter construct pGL2-HIV(−167/+80) was created by transferring the XhoI-HindIII fragment, which contains the HIV-1 promoter region spanning −167 to +80, from p-167 (48Rosen C.A. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Cell. 1985; 41: 813-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) into the same enzyme-cutting sites in pGL2-Basic. The pBS-TAF55(−128/+87) plasmid used to generate riboprobe for RNase protection analysis was created by subcloning theSmaI-HindIII fragment from pGL2-TAF55(−128/+87) into the same enzyme-cutting sites of pBS-SK(+). The other plasmids, pHIV+58 (49Kato H. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1991; 251: 1476-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), pGL7072-161 (50Hou S.Y. Wu S.-Y. Zhou T. Thomas M.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), and pGL2-Control (Promega) have already been described. C-33A cells, which were derived from human cervical carcinoma, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in humidified 5% CO2incubator at 37 °C. Transient transfection was carried out in C-33A cells with 4 μg of each reporter plasmid, either alone or in conjunction with varying amounts of the Gal4-VP16-expressing plasmid (pSGVP) supplemented with the cloning vector (pSG424) to a total of 1 μg, using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described (53Chiang C.-M. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3317-3329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transfected cells, after rinsing twice with 1× PBS, were collected 24 h post-transfection by a rubber policeman and resuspended in 100 μl of T250E5 buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 5 mm EDTA). Cell lysates were then prepared by three cycles of freezing and thawing in liquid nitrogen and a 37 °C water bath. Following centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min, 2 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 350 μl of luciferase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mm ATP, 15 mmMgSO4) with luciferase assays conducted by automatically injecting 100 μl of 0.2 mm luciferin (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) into the samples and measuring the luminescence for 12 s after an initial 2-s delay, using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Transfection and reporter gene assays were performed independently at least four times, each in duplicate. In vitro transcription was performed with HeLa nuclear extracts and analyzed by primer extension as described (50Hou S.Y. Wu S.-Y. Zhou T. Thomas M.C. Chiang C.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Luc-5 primer (5′ CTCTTCATAGCCTTATGCAG 3′) and the Luc-1 primer (5′ TCTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCT 3′) that anneal to nucleotides 151–170 and 81–100, respectively, of pGL2-Basic were used for examining products derived fromhTAF II 55 promoter-containing constructs, whereas a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase primer (5′ CAACGGTGGTATATCCAGTG 3′) that anneals to nucleotides 4936–4953 of pSV2CAT (54Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar) was used for determining the product derived from pHIV+58. All the primer extension products were analyzed on an 8 murea, 5% Long Ranger (FMC) polyacrylamide gel together with the dideoxynucleotide sequencing products generated with the phosphorylated forms of the corresponding primers. Total cellular RNA was prepared from eight 100-mm plates of 80% confluent C-33A cells by guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol extraction method using 8 ml of Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated by first passing heat-treated total cellular RNA, after mixing with an equal volume of 2× loading buffer, through a 1-ml oligo(dT)-cellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column, which was pre-equilibrated with 1× loading buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 m LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS). The flow-through fraction was collected, denatured at 65 °C for 5 min, chilled on ice, and loaded again onto the column. This process was repeated for two additional times. The column was then washed with 6–8 column volumes of 1× loading buffer. Poly(A)+ RNA was eluted with 1 column volume of elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% SDS) for a total of three times, precipitated with ethanol, and finally resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. An antisense riboprobe, corresponding to +87 to −128 of thehTAF II 55 promoter region with flanking polylinker sequences, was synthesized by transcribing theBamHI-linearized pBS-TAF55(−128/+87) template with 2 units of T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of 2 μCi/μl [α-32P]CTP, 10 μm CTP, 0.1 mmATP, UTP, and GTP, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mmdithiothreitol, 1 unit/μl RNasin (Promega), and 2 mmspermidine in a 25-μl mixture. The reaction was conducted at 37 °C for 60 min. The riboprobe was then separated on a 4% polyacrylamide-8m urea gel, eluted from the gel slice in elution buffer (0.5 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA), extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and finally dissolved in 50 μl of 1× hybridization buffer (40 mm PIPES, pH 6.7, 0.4 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). RNase protection assay was carried out as described previously (55Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, ∼5 × 105 cpm of thein vitro synthesized riboprobe was mixed with 3 μg of poly(A)+ RNA in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 80% formamide in a final 1× hybridization buffer, overlaid with mineral oil, heated at 90 °C for 10 min, and hybridized at 58 °C overnight. The hybridization reaction was then quenched on dry ice and incubated with 350 μl of RNase solution containing 14 μg of RNase A (Sigma), 50 units of RNase T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.3m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm EDTA at 30 °C for 60 min. The ribonucleases were degraded by adding 50 μg of proteinase K (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and 5 μl of 10% SDS and incubated for another 15 min at 37 °C. The protected fragments were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, precipitated twice with ethanol, and finally analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide-urea gel with a DNA sequencing ladder loaded in parallel as size markers. The migration differences between the protected RNA fragments and the DNA size markers were adjusted using undigested riboprobe as standard. To understand the regulatory properties of general transcription factor-encoding genes, we isolated a dozen genomic clones from an HT1080 human fibrosarcoma genomic library using probes derived from hTAFII55 cDNA (35Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). One of the isolated clones, 3′-8, containing the entire open reading frame and flanking regions was completely sequenced (17,042 bp, GenBankTM accession numberAF349038). The hTAF II 55 gene, which encodes a component of the eukaryotic core promoter-binding factor TFIID, encompasses the complete cDNA sequence ofhTAF II 55, suggesting that it is an intronless gene (Fig. 1A). This finding is surprising, given the fact that the human general transcription factor-encoding genes so far identified, including TFIIA (α/β and γ), TFIIB, TFIIEα, TFIIEβ, the RAP30 and RAP74 subunits of TFIIF, components (p89, p80, p62, p52, p44, p34, CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1) of TFIIH, TBP, and other TAFIIs in TFIID, all have introns (data not shown). The possibility that our hTAF II 55 genomic DNA was derived from retrotransposition of the hTAFII55 cDNA was excluded for the following reasons. First, a poly(A) tail sequence found at the 3′ end of the hTAFII55 cDNA (35Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) is absent in all of our genomic clones. The hTAFII55 sequences identified in the genomic clones and the cDNA diverge at the 3′ cleavage site where poly (A) addition occurs (data not shown), indicating that reverse transcription and retroviral insertion are unlikely to be involved in generating the genomic copy. Second, all of our independent clones that extended beyond the 3′ end of the hTAFII55 cDNA had identical sequ"

We now report that the mutant Mdm2, defective in p53 binding, does not promote p53 ubiquitination and degradationin vivo or inhibit p53 transcriptional activation. By contrast, the mutant Mdm2, defective in p300 binding, still retains its activity to promote p53 ubiquitination and to inhibit p53 transcriptional activation but fails in promoting p53 degradation. We also show that both wild-type Mdm2 and the mutant Mdm2, defective in p300 binding, can promote the ubiquitination of cancer-derived p53 mutants, but only wild-type Mdm2 can cause their degradation. Furthermore, adenoviral oncoprotein, 12S.E.1A, but not its deletion mutant that lacks p300 binding, was shown to decrease in vivo ubiquitination of mutant p53. Taken together, these results provide genetic evidence that p300 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of Mdm2-mediated p53 turnover by integrating the cellular ubiquitination and proteolytic processes.

Diverse mutations in the p53 gene constitute the most common type of genetic alterations in human cancers (2Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C.

Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS)1 patients, suffering from a cancer-prone hereditary disorder, have been shown to harbor germ line mutations of the p53 gene (3Malkin D. Li F.P. Strong L.C.

Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4042) Google Scholar). In cellular response to DNA damage and other stresses, p53 protein accumulates and transcriptionally activates its target genes, which includep21 cip/waf1, GADD45, Mdm2,bax, and other p53-inducible genes. The activation of these genes is believed to result in either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (5Levine A.J.

Additionally, p53 has been demonstrated to have a role in the modulation of nucleotide excision repair (7Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been established that the turnover of p53 is regulated in part by the ubiquitin proteolysis pathway (12Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 13Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is first sequentially transferred through the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and the ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3). The E3 enzyme then transfers the ubiquitin to one or more lysine residues in the substrate. Multiple ubiquitin molecules are attached to one another to form a polyubiquitin chain, which is deemed sufficient in targeting substrate proteins for destruction by the proteasome (reviewed in Ref. 14Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Mdm2 can regulate the stability of p53 through the ubiquitin proteolysis pathway (15Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar, 16Kubbutat M.H. Ludwig R.L. Levine A.J. Vousden K.H.

More recent studies have demonstrated that Mdm2 has intrinsic E3 activity, which can ubiquitinate p53 and Mdm2 itself (18Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 19Honda R. Yasuda H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 20Maki C.G. J. Biol.

Although in vitro ubiquitination of p53 by Mdm2 only requires the addition of E1, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and Ub (18Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H.

For example, adenoviral oncoprotein E1A has been shown to cause p53 stabilization in multiple cell types through interaction with p300/CBP or with Rb family proteins (22Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 23Sanchez-Prieto R. Lleonart M. Cajal S.R.Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 675-682PubMed Google Scholar, 24Chiou S.K. White E. J.

The p53 polyubiquitination activity in cell extracts has demonstrated a significant decrease upon the induction of E1A expression (26Nakajima T. Morita K. Tsunoda H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Oda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20036-20045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It has been reported recently that most endogenous Mdm2 is bound to p300 and that specific interactions between p300/CBP, p53, and Mdm2 are intimately involved in Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation (27Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.-X. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that interaction of p300/CBP with DNA repair protein hHR32A leads to the down-regulation of p53 (28Zhu Q. Wani G. Wani M.A. Wani A.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 64-70PubMed Google Scholar). The current experiments investigated whether cellular p300 plays a role as a platform to bring together the necessary catalytic and regulatory factors needed for in vivo p53 ubiquitination and degradation (27Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.-X. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The data presented demonstrate that (i) the Mdm2 mutant defective in binding to p300/CBP can promote ubiquitination but not degradation of either wild-type or cancer-derived mutant p53, and (ii) wild-type E1A, but not its deletion mutant lacking p300/CBP binding, can decrease ubiquitination of p53 in vivo. These results provide evidence that p300 plays a pivotal role in Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation by integrating ubiquitination and proteolytic processes. Wild-type and mutant p53 expression vectors, p53(Wt), p53–143A (Val → Ala), p53–173H (Arg → His), and p53–248W (Arg → Trp) as well as pG13-lucwere provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Construct pG13-luc is a luciferase reporter containing 13 copies of synthetic p53 consensus binding sites derived from the native p21cip/waf1 promoter (29Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Mdm2 constructs, pCMV-Mdm2, pCMV-Mdm2Δ4 and pCOC-Mdm2ΔXM, were provided by Dr. Arnold Levine (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ), Dr. David Livingston (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), and Dr. Moshe Oren (The Weizman Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel), respectively. The pCMV-Mdm2 encodes a full-length Mdm2 protein. The pCMV-Mdm2Δ4 encodes a mutant Mdm2 protein with a deletion from 217 to 246 amino acid positions. The pCOC-Mdm2ΔXM contains an internal deletion and consequently encodes a truncated Mdm2 protein initiated at the AUG amino acid position 62 (30). The Wt 12S.E.1A and mutant E1A constructs were obtained from Dr. Michael Mathews (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). The pBIND-p53-(1–71) and pBIND-p53-(19–71), encoding the corresponding p53 N-terminal domains, were constructed by in-frame fusion of the respective domains with yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain. The specific p53 domains were generated by polymerase chain reaction, and individual fragments were inserted into the parent plasmid vector, pBIND (Promega). The pG5-Lucvector, containing five Gal4 binding sites upstream of a minimal TATA box followed by a firefly luciferase gene, was purchased from Promega. The expression vector for HA-Ub (31Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Dirk Bohmann (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany). The LFS 041 fibroblast strain MDAH041 (p53-null, harboring a codon 184 frameshift mutation that results in premature termination of translation of the p53 protein) was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Tainsky (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). These fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For the detection of Ub-p53 conjugates in vivo, exponentially growing LFS 041 fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 5 ∼ 6 × 105 cells/10-cm dish 18–20 h before transfection. The cells were transfected with expression vectors for p53, Mdm2 or mutant Mdm2, HA-Ub, and 12S.E.1A or mutant E1A in different combinations as indicated in each figure legend. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (28Zhu Q. Wani G. Wani M.A. Wani A.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 64-70PubMed Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA for each transfection was kept constant by the addition of cognate empty vector. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and then treated for 10 h with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or lactacystin at 10 µm. Protein extracts were made from all cells including any detached cells in 750 µl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1.0% deoxycholate, 0.025% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture). The extracts were sonicated to reduce the viscosity. Immunoprecipitates were prepared by overnight incubation with 15 µl of anti-p53 monoclonal antibody DO6 (200 µg/ml, NeoMarkers) and 20 µl (bed volume) of protein A/protein G agarose beads (Oncogene Science) at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and the bound proteins were boiled off in SDS sample buffer for 5 min and then separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To avoid any detection of mouse IgG (∼55 kDa), separated proteins with molecular mass greater than the ∼60-kDa range were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and proteins were detected as described previously (9Wani M.A. Zhu Q.Z. El-mahdy M. Wani A.A. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Venkatachalam S. Denissenko M. Wani A.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The bound antibodies were removed from the filters with a stripper buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 500 mm NaCl, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and the membranes were rescued for second immunodetection of the Ub-p53 conjugates by anti-p53 antibody Ab-1801. To detect p53 and other proteins without immunoprecipitation, the expression vector for p53 or mutant p53 was co-transfected with Mdm2, Mdm2ΔXM, or Mdm2Δ4 expression vector. To evaluate the effects of E1A expression on Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation, the expression vector for p53 was similarly co-transfected with Mdm2 in the absence and presence of increasing amounts of 12S.E.1A or E1AΔ-(2–36) expression vector. In these experiments, the LFS 041 fibroblasts (5 ∼ 6 × 105) were transfected for 24 h, the cells were washed and lysed in an SDS sample buffer, and proteins were quantitated and processed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted for specific detection of p53, Mdm2, and E1A as well as actin proteins. For the transient transfection/reporter assay, exponentially growing LFS 041 fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/35-mm dish 18–20 h prior to transfection. 0.5 µg each of p53 reporter pG13-luc and p53 expression vectors were co-transfected into LFS 041 cells in the absence or presence of 2 µg of expression vector for wild-type or mutant Mdm2 using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according manufacturer instructions. Empty vector, pcDNA3, DNA was used to maintain the total amount of DNA for each transfection. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 100 µl of cell culture lysis reagent. Luciferase activity was determined in 20 µl of cell lysates by using a luciferase substrate (Promega) and monitoring luminescence with a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). To determine transcriptional activation by the p53 N-terminal transcription activation domain fused to Gal4 DNA binding domain, the pG5-luc reporter was substituted for the pG13-luc in the transfection assay. Relative luciferase activity for each time point was determined from three independently transfected plates. p53 degradation depends on its ability to specifically interact with the N-terminal domain of Mdm2 (15Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar, 17Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the p300 protein, as part of a complex with Mdm2, is also shown to be involved in Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation (27Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.-X. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In view of recent studies on Mdm2 as a ubiquitin ligase (18Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 19Honda R. Yasuda H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16531-16535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we sought to understand the contributions of the specific protein interactions of Mdm2 and p300 in p53 ubiquitination in vivo. Thus, the initial experiments determined the ability of two structurally different Mdm2 mutants to promote p53 ubiquitination. As shown in Fig. 1, Mdm2ΔXM contains an N-terminal deletion, and the truncated Mdm2 protein starts at amino acid position 62. Because of its inability to bind p53, this truncated Mdm2 protein fails to (i) inhibit p53-dependent transcriptional activation, (ii) abolish p53-mediated apoptosis, and (iii) promote in vivo p53 degradation (15Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar, 30Haupt Y. Barak Y. Oren M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1596-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, Mdm2Δ4 contains an internal deletion and the protein, while retaining its ability to bind p53, is defective in binding p300 in vivo. Consequently, Mdm2Δ4 is also defective in promoting p53 degradation in vivo (27Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.-X. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Thus, in vivoubiquitination of wild-type and various mutant p53 proteins was determined upon co-expression with these Mdm2 molecules and by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. As can be seen in Fig.2 A, an anti-HA-reactive ladder of bands, appearing as a smear of apparent molecular mass of ∼66–220 kDa and representing HA-Ub-p53 conjugates, was distinctly visible inlane 4 where p53 was co-transfected withMdm2(Wt) and HA-Ub. No such conjugates were apparent in samples of various control transfections withoutHA-Ub (lanes 1, 2, and 3) or without Mdm2 (lane 7). The data suggest that the conjugates result from specific interaction with Mdm2. As expected, co-transfection of p53 with mutantMdm2ΔXM did not produce any conjugates (lane 5), indicating that because of its inability to bind p53, Mdm2ΔXM is defective in mediating p53 ubiquitination. This observation is consistent with the early finding that Mdm2ΔXM does not promote p53 degradation in vivo (15Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar, 30Haupt Y. Barak Y. Oren M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1596-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Ubiquitinated p53 conjugates appeared with an even higher intensity when p53 was co-transfected with mutant Mdm2Δ4 (lane 6). Thus, this mutant, having an intact N terminus, can promote pronounced p53 ubiquitination. Overall results indicate that Mdm2 defective for p300 binding is not impaired in its ability to mediate p53 ubiquitination. This observation is novel and highly interesting, because as mentioned above, such mutant Mdm2 is defective in promoting p53 degradation (27Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C.

LFS 041 cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors for p53 (1 µg), Mdm2(Wt), or mutant Mdm2 (4 µg) along with HA-Ub (4 µg). The total amount of DNA for each transfection was kept at 10 µg by the addition of empty vector. After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated for 10 h with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 µm). Whole-cell extracts were made in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and immunoprecipitates were prepared by using the anti-p53 monoclonal antibody DO6 and protein A/protein G agarose beads. Immunoprecipitates (i.p.) were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with an anti-HA antibody. A, p53(Wt) and wild-type or mutant Mdm2 were co-expressed with or without HA-Ub as indicated. KD, kilodalton. B, mutant p53 and the indicated wild-type or mutant Mdm2 were co-expressed with HA-Ub. C, wild-type and mutant p53 and Mdm2(Wt) were co-expressed, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed simultaneously.Lanes 4* and 8* show the longer time exposure of HA-Ub-p53 conjugates seen in the corresponding lanes 4 and8.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that Mdm2Δ4 specifically mediates ubiquitination of p53, various cancer-derived p53 mutants were tested for ubiquitination upon transfection by Mdm2 and Mdm2Δ4(Fig. 2 B). The p53 mutants 143A (Val → Ala), 173H (Arg → His), and 248W (Arg → Trp) were seen to ubiquitinate to approximately equivalent levels when co-expressed with Mdm2(Wt). More importantly, mutant Mdm2Δ4, with an intact N terminus, also ubiquitinated the various p53 mutants tested to an extent comparable with Mdm(Wt). These results reproducibly demonstrate that Mdm2Δ4 can ubiquitinate both wild-type and mutant p53 proteins. It should be noted that these mutant forms of p53 are devoid of sequence-specific DNA binding activity and were unable to activate the expression of a gene under the control of p53-responsive DNA binding site (29Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Thus, these results suggest that the p53 transcriptional activation process is not associated with p53 ubiquitination. For direct comparison, the ubiquitination of wild-type and cancer-derived mutant p53 by Mdm(Wt) in concomitant transfections and identical exposure conditions is shown in Fig. 2 C. Surprisingly, ubiquitin conjugates of p53 mutants were found to accumulate in vivo much more efficiently than those of p53(Wt) (lanes 5, 6, and 7 versus lane 4). Nevertheless, ubiquitin conjugates of p53(Wt) (as shown above (Fig. 1 A)), could be visualized with longer time exposures (lane 4* and 8*). It should be noted that in all these experiments, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 had to be used to treat cells after transfection to allow ubiquitin conjugates to accumulate. Also, similar results were obtained using another highly specific and irreversible proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin (34Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Thus, it would seem that the inhibitory effect of proteasome inhibitors was manifested more prominently on mutant p53 than on p53(Wt) ubiquitin-protein conjugates, perhaps also because mutant p53 is more easily ubiquitinated. Mdm2 is known to bind p53 and inhibit its transcriptional activation (30Haupt Y. Barak Y. Oren M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1596-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the effect of mutant Mdm2Δ4 overexpression on the ability of p53 for transactivation. LFS 041 cells were co-transfected withp53(Wt) and the pG13-luc reporter in the presence of Mdm2(Wt),Mdm2ΔXM, or Mdm2Δ4. Luciferase activity of the cell extracts from various transfections is shown in Fig. 3. As expected,p53(Wt) dramatically elevated luciferase activity relative to the control pCMV vector (Fig. 3 A). Co-transfection of Mdm2(Wt) blocked the ability of p53 to transactivate the reporter construct. By contrast, mutant Mdm2ΔXM failed to inhibit p53 activity, confirming that the inhibition requires the binding of Mdm2 to p53 (30Haupt Y. Barak Y. Oren M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1596-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). On the contrary, mutant Mdm2Δ4, in keeping with its ability to bind p53, was found to block transactivation by p53 to an extent comparable with that of Mdm2(Wt) (27Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.-X. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Similar experiments were then carried out to verify the effects of Mdm2 and its mutants on transcriptional activity of the p53 N-terminal activation domain. As shown in Fig. 3 B, co-transfection of Mdm2(Wt) or mutantMdm2Δ4 inhibited luciferase activity transcribed from reporter pG5-luc to a comparable extent. However, mutant Mdm2ΔXM failed to exhibit any inhibitory effects but instead increased luciferase activity ∼1.5-fold. Deletion of the Mdm2-binding site (from 1 to 19 amino acid positions) caused a dramatic decrease in the transactivation activity of Gal4-p53 to a level that was slightly above that achieved with Mdm2(Wt). Both Mdm2(Wt) and mutant Mdm2Δ4 were unable to exhibit a significant inhibitory effect on the transactivation activity of the truncated Gal4-p53-(19–71). These results show that the amino acids, spanning positions 1–19 in the p53 activation domain, contribute a very important component to the transactivation by p53 and provide the needed binding site for Mdm2 to cause inhibition of p53 activity. Taken together, it can be concluded that the binding of Mdm2 to p53, but not to p300, is responsible for the inhibition of p53-dependent transcriptional activation. Therefore, the binding of Mdm2 to p53 is required for both the ubiquitination and inactivation of p53. Failure to promote in vivop53 degradation by the mutants Mdm2ΔXM and Mdm2Δ4 was confirmed by co-transfection experiments in LFS 041 cells and analyzing the protein steady-state levels by Western blotting. As expected from previous studies (15Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar, 27Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.-X. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), the p53 steady-state level was reduced markedly in cells co-transfected with Mdm2(Wt). No such decrease was, however, seen in cells co-transfected with either the Mdm2ΔXMor Mdm2Δ4 mutants (Fig.4 A). In comparison to p53 levels, cells transfected with the mutant Mdm2 showed appreciably higher levels of Mdm2 than those transfected with either the Mdm2(Wt) or the control vector. Similar patterns were exhibited in experiments extended to determine whether Mdm2 could promote degradation of cancer-derived mutant p53 proteins. The data indicate that these cancer-derived p53 missense mutants can efficiently, albeit with varying degrees, be down-regulated upon co-expression of Mdm2(Wt) but not mutants Mdm2ΔXM or Mdm2Δ4 (Fig.4 B). In conclusion Mdm2, to effectively maintain the cellular p53 protein level, requires the functional interaction of Mdm2 and p53 for the dual events, i.e. ubiqutination and degradation, of the p53 ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. Ubiquitination of p53, however, does not necessarily lead to proteasomal degradation, which depends on the additional binding interaction of Mdm2 with p300. E1A can stabilize p53 via binding to p300-(22–25). This binding is known to disrupt the transcriptional co-activation mediated by CBP/p300 (35Lill N.L. Grossman S.R. Ginsberg D. DeCaprio J. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). In an effort to explore the role of p300 in the regulation of p53 stability, we next examined whether E1A could stabilize p53 protein in the presence of Mdm2. As shown in Fig. 5 A, Mdm2 expression drastically decreased the steady-state level of p53. Co-expression of 12S.E.1A overcame the Mdm2-affected decrease of p53 steady-state levels in a dose-dependent manner and restored it to the level observed in control without any Mdm2. Interestingly, co-expression of E1AΔ-(2–36) lacking p300-binding also resulted in the restoration of the p53 expression level as reported earlier (36Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B). Because E1AΔ-(2–36) is known to possess the ability to bind several members of the Rb family (37Stein R.W. Corrigan M. Yaciuk P. Whelan J. Moran E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this result would seem to suggest the involvement of other cellular factor(s), e.g. Rb, in this process. To examine the effect of E1A on the in vivo ubiquitination of p53 by Mdm2, we took advantage of our previous observation that the proteolysis of ubiquitin conjugates of p53 mutants is more susceptible to inhibition by proteasome inhibitors.

It has recently been reported that FLASH is likely to be a component of DISC involved in Fas- and TNF-mediated apoptosis (26Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). FLASH contains a death-effector-domain-recruiting domain (DRD) in the C-terminal region, which interacts with the death effector domain (DED) of caspase-8 or FADD (26Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Still, transient overexpression of FLASH marginally affects apoptosis (26Imai Y. Kimura T.

In addition, the finding that caspase-8 and FADD may be involved in the signaling to NF-κB activation as well as to apoptosis (28Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y.

In this report, we used an antisense oligonucleotide (AS) and overexpression analysis to show that FLASH transduces the TNF-α signal, leading to the activation of NF-κB via a TRAF2-NIK-IKK-dependent pathway. Anti-IκBα and anti-tubulin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Crutz, CA) and Sigma, respectively. Anti-HA antibody and anti-TRAF2 antibody (SC-7346) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. TNF-α and all other molecular biology grade materials were from Sigma or New England Biolabs (Hertfordshire, UK). pME18S-FLAG and pME18S-FLAG-FLASH were kindly provided by Dr. Yonehara (University of Kyoto, Japan). pHA-FLASH was generated by subcloning the FLASH cDNA into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of pcDNA-HA plasmid. FLASH deletion constructs were assembled by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following synthetic oligonucleotides as primers: 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGCAGATGATGACAATGGT-3′ and 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCCTAGCTCTCCATGCTAACAACT-3′ for pME18S-FLAG-ΔA-(1–858) (pFL-ΔA-FLASH); 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGAGAGCTCATGTGCAATT-3′ and 5′-ACCGGGCCCCTATCCAGTTCTAGGCAAAGA-3′ for pcDNA-HA-ΔB-(856–1552) (pHA-ΔB-FLASH); 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGCAGATGATGACAATGGT-3′ and 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCCTACAGTGAAGATTTAAAATTC-3′ for pME18S-FLAG-ΔC-(1–1191) (pFL-ΔC-FLASH); 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGAGAGCTGCTCATGTGCAATT-3′ and 5′-CATTTAGGTGACACTA-3′ for pME18S-FLAG-ΔD-(1553–1962) (pFL-ΔD-FLASH); 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGAGAGCTCATGTGCAATT-3′ and 5′-CATTTAGGTGACACTA-3′ for pME18S-FLAG-ΔE-(856–1962) (pFL-ΔE-FLASH). The PCR products were then inserted into the EcoRI/NotI sites of pME18S-FLAG (ΔA, ΔC, ΔD, and ΔE), theEcoRI/ApaI sites of pcDNA3-HA (pHA-ΔB-FLASH), or the EcoRI/NotI sites of pcDNA3-HA (pHA-ΔD-FLASH). GST-NAD-FLASH and GST-DRD-FLASH fusion proteins were generated by subcloning PCR products amplified by 5′-CGCGGATCCCCTAGAGTTTCTGCTGAA-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTACAGTGAAGATTTAAATT-3′ for pGST-NAD-FLASH and 5′-CGCGGATCCGATAAGAGTAAACTAACTC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTATTCACAGGAGCCAGGAGA-3′ for pGST-DRD-FLASH into theBamHI/XhoI sites of pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.).

AS-2 (5′-ATTCAGCAACTTACTTGC-3′) is an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to human FLASH mRNA and corresponds to a location around the stop codon, 5942–5959 bp downstream of the translation initiation site. Comparison of this oligonucleotide sequence with the database detected the only homology to the FLASH sequence. The following scrambled sequence was used as a control: (5′-GCTACTAGTAGCAGCTAC-3′). Cells (3 × 106 per well) were continuously treated with 5 μm FLASH antisense or the scrambled oligonucleotide for 48 h in culture medium containing LipofectAMINE reagent. Total RNA was isolated from HEK293 cells using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RT-PCR was performed for quantification of FLASH mRNA using β-actin mRNA as a control. Two sets of oligonucleotides were designed; 5′-TAGGTGCTTTTATTGACTTGACACAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGGAATTCAGCAACTTATCTGCAT-3′ (antisense) (predicted product length: 725 bp) for FLASH primer 1 and 5′-GAAGGTAATCATCCTGCATTAGCTGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAGCTTCATTAGCTGCTGGAATCTT-3′ (antisense) (predicted product length: 714 bp) for FLASH primer 2. The nucleotide sequences of the β-actin primers were 5′-CAACCGCGAGAAGATGACCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAAGGAAGGCTGGAAGAGTG-3′ (antisense) (predicted product length: 457 base pairs). The PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and luciferase activities in the cell extracts were determined using a luciferase assay system (Promega). To measure β-galactosidase activity, the cell extracts were mixed with equal amounts of β-galactosidase assay buffer (2×) containing 200 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.3), 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 1.33 mg/mlO-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The absorbance at 420 nm was then measured using an ELISA reader (Molecular Device, Sunnyvale, CA). GST-DRD-FLASH fusion proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) by addition of 0.2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and administered into a rabbit in a series of four injections. Anti-FLASH antibody was purified from the serum by antigen-affinity chromatography. For Western blot analysis, cell lysates were prepared, and protein concentrations were determined using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Western blotting was then carried out as previously described (31Jung Y. Miura M. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5112-5117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The expression of GST fusion proteins in BL21 (DE3) harboring pGEX-4T, pGEX-DRD-FLASH, or pGEX-NAD-FLASH was induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside during exponential growth. Harvested cells were resuspended and lysed by sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The supernatant lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B. TRAF2, or caspase-8 labeled with [35S]methionine using the TNT system (Promega) were then added to GST fusion proteins (20 μg each) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B in a final volume of 500 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). After being incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle mixing, the beads were washed three times with the binding buffer, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. HEK293 cells were transfected with pHA-FLASH, pHA-ΔB-FLASH, and pTRAF2 plasmids and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mm NaF). FLASH was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates after incubation with anti-FLASH and anti-HA antibodies and protein-A-coupled-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.) at 4 °C for 2 h. TRAF2, HA-FLASH, and HA-ΔB-FLASH were then detected by Western blot analysis using anti-TRAF2 and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies, respectively. To identify a role for FLASH in TNF-α signaling, we initially examined its contribution to NF-κB activation by directly targeting FLASH expression using an AS. Four different ASs were synthesized based on the nucleotide sequence of human FLASH and when examined, they showed essentially similar effects on TNF-α-signaling (data not shown). Treating HEK293 cells with AS-2, but not with a scrambled oligonucleotide (as a negative control), abolished TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB, as assessed by luciferase reporter gene expression driven by a NF-κB responsive promoter (Fig. 1A), and also suppressed TNF-α-induced degradation of IκBα (Fig.1B). Because we could detect exogenous FLASH expression (Fig.2B) but failed to detect expression of endogenous FLASH with Western blot analysis using anti-FLASH antibody, the effects of AS-2 or the scrambled oligonucleotide on FLASH expression were assessed by RT-PCR (Fig.1C). RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis have both been used to examine the effects of antisense on gene expression (32Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar). FLASH mRNA was undetectable in HEK293 cells treated with AS-2, whereas tubulin expression was unaffected, and readily detectable in cells treated with the scrambled oligonucleotide, indicating that FLASH expression was reduced by AS-2 treatment. These results suggest that FLASH is involved in TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB. To more directly assess the role of FLASH in the activation of NF-κB signaling, we examined an effect of its overexpression on NF-κB activity in HEK293 cells. We found that, indeed, NF-κB activity was dose-dependently related to FLASH expression (Fig. 2A). The relative levels of expression of FLASH and TRAF2 were confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B). FLASH contains DRD at its C terminus and a putative oligomerization domain at its N terminus (Fig.3A) (26Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To ascertain which of these mediates induction of NF-κB activity, effects of several FLASH deletion mutants (Fig. 3A,ΔA–ΔE) were examined. Expression of these deletions was confirmed in the transfected HEK293 cells by Western blot analysis using anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies (data not shown). Determination of NF-κB activity following the respective expression of each of these constructs showed that the truncation in the ΔB-, ΔC-, and ΔE-FLASH constructs had no effect on the ability of FLASH to activate NF-κB (Fig. 3B). The ΔD-FLASH, by contrast, completely abolished NF-κB activation, whereas the ΔA-FLASH partially induced NF-κB activity (Fig.3B). Because the ΔB-, ΔC-, and ΔE-FLASH contain a common region including a putative oligomerization domain, the region responsible for the activation of NF-κB apparently spans most of the oligomerization domain and part of the ΔA-FLASH domain (Fig.3A). We designate the common region in the ΔB-, ΔC-, and ΔE-FLASH spanning residues 856–1191 as the NF-κB activation domain (NAD) of FLASH. Because it is known that TNF-α treatment of cells leads to the activation of NF-κB through the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (33Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar, 34Reuther J.Y. Baldwin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20664-20670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), exposure of HEK293 cells to TNF-α resulted in the degradation of IκBα (Fig. 3C, left panel). Transient expression of FLASH, TRAF2, or ΔB-FLASH led to the degradation of IκBα, whereas overexpression of the ΔD-FLASH did not affect the degradation of IκBα (Fig. 3C, right panel), consistent with the results of NF-κB activity assays in Fig. 3B. These results demonstrate and confirm that FLASH expression through NAD in ΔB-FLASH induces NF-κB activation by the degradation of IκBα. It has previously been shown that various signaling proteins downstream of TNF-R, including TRADD, TRAFs, RIP, NIK, and IKKs, are involved in TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB. We therefore examined the respective roles of these proteins in FLASH-induced activation of NF-κB. Expression of dominant negative mutants of TRAF2-(87–501), NIK (K429A,K430A), or IKKα (K44A) inhibited NF-κB activation induced by FLASH (Fig.4A) or TNF-α (Fig.4B). On the other hand, although dominant negative mutants of TRAF5-(205–558) and TRAF6-(289–530) partially suppressed TNF-α- or FLASH-induced activation of NF-κB (Fig. 4B), they showed little effect on both TNF-α- and FLASH-induced activation of NF-κB (Fig. 4, A and B), which thus appears to be mainly mediated via a TRAF2-NIK-IKK-pathway. That FLASH interacts with TRAF2 was then examined within vitro binding assay and immunoprecipitation. GST pull-down assay showed that GST-NAD fusion protein could bind to TRAF2, whereas GST-DRD interacted only with caspase-8, indicating that NAD of FLASH specifically interacts with TRAF2 in vitro (Fig.5). Immunoprecipitation assays were then performed to examine cellular interaction of FLASH and TRAF2 in Jurkat, HEK 293, and HeLa cells. Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLASH antibody and subsequent Western blot analysis using anti-TRAF2 antibody revealed that endogenous TRAF2 was co-precipitated with endogenous FLASH, but not by preimmune serum (Fig.6A). Endogenous FLASH could not be detected with Western blot analysis using anti-FLASH antibody in the immunoprecipitates probably because of its low expression level in Jurkat cells. We have then generated HeLa cells stably expressing exogenous FLASH tagged with HA (HeLa/HA-FLASH) and further examined the intracellular interactions. Immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody followed by Western blotting using anti-TRAF2 antibody or anti-HA antibody showed the presence of TRAF2 and HA-FLASH in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that FLASH interacts with TRAF2 in the cells.Figure 6Cellular interaction of FLASH with TRAF2.A, proteins from Jurkat cell extracts were immunoprecipitated (IP), separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with preimmune (pre) or anti-TRAF2 monoclonal antibody. B, proteins from HeLa cell permanently expressing HA-FLASH (HeLa/HA-FLASH) were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and probed with anti-TRAF2 antibody (upper panel) or anti-HA antibody (lower panel). C, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pHA-FLASH in the presence or absence of pTRAF2. One day later, proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLASH antibody or anti-HA antibody and immunoblotted with anti-TRAF2 antibody. D, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with pHA-ΔB-FLASH and pTRAF2, immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and immunoblotted with anti-TRAF2 (upper panels) or anti-HA antibody (lower panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have then examined cellular interaction of NAD of FLASH with TRAF2. HEK293 cells were transfected with pHA-FLASH (Fig. 6C) or pHA-ΔB-FLASH (Fig. 6D) in the presence or absence of TRAF2. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis showed that endogenous (Fig. 6C, middle panel) or exogenous TRAF2 (Fig. 6C, right panel) was co-precipitated with FLASH by anti-FLASH antibody or anti-HA antibody. As expected fromin vitro binding assays, ΔB-FLASH was co-immunoprecipitated with TRAF2 by anti-HA antibody from lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with both pHA-ΔB-FLASH and pTRAF2 (Fig.6D). These results suggest that FLASH may directly interact with TRAF2 through its NAD. Previous studies have suggested that TNF-R-mediated apoptosis and NF-κB activation pathways pass through TRADD, a death domain-containing adaptor protein interacting with TNF-R in a TNF-dependent process; TRADD-FADD-caspase-8 and TRADD-TRAF2-RIP-NIK-IKKs cascades lead to the induction of apoptosis and activation of an anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-κB, respectively. Whereas FLASH may be required for the activation of caspase-8 during Fas- and TNF-R-mediated apoptosis (26Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 27Medema J.P. Nature. 1999; 398: 756-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the data presented here provide the first evidence for involvement of FLASH in NF-κB activation by TNF-R. The physical interaction of FLASH with TRAF2, demonstrated here in vitro and in vivo(Figs. 5 and 6), lends further support to the idea that FLASH transduces TNF-α signals via a TRAF2-dependent pathway of NF-κB activation. Though dominant negative mutants of TRAF5 and 6 also partially suppressed FLASH- and TNF-α-mediated activation of NF-κB (Fig. 4, A and B), complex formation of FLASH with additional signal mediators leading to NF-κB signaling such as other TRAFs, TRADD, or RIP remains to be elucidated. 2Y. H. Choi, K. B. Kim, B. J. Kim, and Y. K. Jung, manuscript in preparation. FLASH as a component of apoptotic signaling complexes is likely to mediate apoptosis signals probably triggered by cell surface receptors. However, the fact that FLASH activates NF-κB may explain the observation that in many cell types, TNF treatment did not induce apoptosis in the absence of gene expression. With respect to the role of FLASH as an activator interacting with caspase-8 and FADD, the lack of a significant increase of apoptosis following overexpression of both FLASH and caspase-8 or the inability of TNF-α to induce apoptosis in a subset of tumor cells may be attributed to FLASH-mediated activation of NF-κB. NAD-mediated activation of NF-κB may antagonize DRD-mediated apoptotic signals by encoding inhibitory proteins such as IAPs and IEX-1L (5Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr A.S.

Moreover, recent reports that FADD and caspase-8 may be required for cell survival and proliferation during heart and thymus development may be explained by our observations of FLASH-mediated activation of NF-κB. This speculation is reinforced by our observation that FLASH transduced NF-κB signaling evoked by caspase-8 (data not shown). FLASH seems to be an upstream component of various receptor-mediated signals including TNF-α and most likely has a dual function in apoptosis and NF-κB signaling. We have additional evidences that FLASH is also an indispensable component in receptor-mediated apoptosis. As a component of DISC during apoptosis and also of the protein complex including TRAFs leading to NF-κB signaling, FLASH needs to be further characterized for the stoichiometry of protein-protein interactions and for a fine-tuning activity balancing survival and apoptosis.

We cloned and sequenced 5 kilobase pairs of the rat GluR1 promoter and identified multiple transcriptional start sites between −295 and −202 (relative to the first ATG). Similar to other glutamate receptor subunit promoters, the GluR1 promoter lacks TATA and CAAT elements in that region but binds Sp1 proteins at two sites. Promoter activity of GluR1 fragments cloned into pGL3 was assessed by immunocytochemistry and by measuring luciferase activity after transfection into primary cultures of rat cortical neurons and glia. GluR1 promoter activity was stronger in neurons, with neuronal specificity appearing to reside mainly within the neuronal expression-enhancing regions, −1395 to −743 and −253 to −48. The latter region contains 4 sites that bound recombinant cAMP-response element-binding proteins and a glial silencing region between −253 and −202. In both neurons and glia, promoter activity was increased by a 64-base pair GA repeat upstream of the initiation sites and reduced by a 57-base pair region that contained an N box.

AMPA receptors are assembled from GluR1–GluR4 subunits and mediate fast excitatory responses at most synapses. AMPA receptor subunits, including GluR1, are expressed by neurons and glial cellsin vivo and in vitro (for reviews see Refs. 1Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar and2Gallo V. Ghiani C.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), but the density of functional receptors is much lower in astrocytes than neurons. GluR1 expression is regulated by many different stimuli. For example, GluR1 protein levels are up-regulated by basic fibroblast growth factor in hippocampal neurons (3Cheng B. Furukawa K. O'Keefe J.A. Goodman Y. Kihiko M. Fabian T. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2525-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and GluR1 transcription is increased by basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (4Chew L.-J. Fleck M.W. Wright P. Scherer S.E. Mayer M.L. Gallo V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 227-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cultured cerebellar granule cells, high potassium (25 mm) induces GluR1 mRNA levels by 27-fold and protein levels by 11-fold (5Condorelli D.F. Dell'Albani P. Aronic E. Genazzani A.A. Casabona G. Corsaro M. Balazs R. Nicoletti F. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2133-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). GluR1 is also induced during long term potentiation (6Nayak A. Zastrow D.J. Lickteig R.

Mengod G. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 21: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as well as immunoreactivity (10Mathern G.W. Pretorius J.K. Mendoza D. Lozada A. Leite J.P. Chimelli L. Fried I.

Speckmann E.-J. Neuroscience. 1999; 94: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have been reported. Furthermore, chronic treatment with cocaine or morphine up-regulates GluR1 specifically in the ventral tegmental area, an area known to be involved in addiction (12Churchill L. Swanson C.J. Urbina M. Kalivas P.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2397-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 13Fitzgerald L.W. Ortiz J. Hamedani A.G. Nestler E.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 274-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and GluR1 is up-regulated after treatment with haloperidol or clozapine in the medial prefrontal cortex (14Fitzgerald L.W. Deutch A.Y. Gasic G. Heinemann S.F. Nestler E.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2453-2461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, GluR1 levels decline with maturation in the brain (15Pelligrini-Giampietro D.E. Bennett M.V.L. Zukin R.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 144: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Moreover, neurectomy of the hypoglossal nerve leads to total loss of GluR1 in the hypoglossal nucleus 14 days later, with recovery by 60 days after the transection (16Yeo J.F. Tang F.R. Leong S.K. Int. J. Neurosci. 1997; 90: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Deafferentiation in the dorsal horn produces down-regulation of GluR1 in laminae I and II and up-regulation in laminae III–V (17Carlton S.M. Hargett G.L. Coggeshall R.E. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 242: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, GluR1 expression is up- and down-regulated in multiple conditions, both normal and pathological, but the mechanisms regulating GluR1 expression have not been studied previously. As an initial step toward this goal, we have cloned the rat GluR1 promoter. We have identified Sp1- and CREB-binding sites near the transcriptional start sites and several regions that contribute to high expression in neurons. Probes for genomic screening were radiolabeled using random primers, Klenow DNA polymerase, and [α-32P]ATP (Megaprime kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). About 1.35 × 106 phage plaques from a Wistar rat genomic library (in λ dash II vector, Stratagene) were screened on nitrocellulose filters using the 5′ 1587-bpSacI-BamHI fragment from rat GluR1 cDNA (18Hollmann M. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Rogers S.W. Heinemann S. Nature. 1989; 342: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number X17184) as a probe. Five initially positive plaques were rescreened twice, prepared on a large scale, and restriction-site mapped in Southern blots. Out of the five phages, one phage insert hybridized to a PCR-amplified probe (bases 16–223 of the GluR1 cDNA) and contained mainly 5′-untranslated sequence, the first intron, and at least part of the second intron. ASacI-SacI fragment containing 5035-bp 5′ sequence, the first exon, and 593 bp of the first intron was subcloned into the pBluescript KS(−) vector. This construct and several deletion constructs derived from it were sequenced. Moreover, a 4.7-kbEcoRI-EcoRI fragment with the 5′ EcoRI site at −459 (relative to the first ATG) and containing the first intron and at least part of the second intron was cloned into pBluescript KS(−) and partially sequenced (see Fig. 1). The programs from the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) and MatInspector (19Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) were used for sequence analysis of the promoter. To obtain a control RNA for primer extension and RNase protection assays, a deletion construct from the originalSacI-SacI construct was made by digestion withEcoRI and religation, resulting in a GluR1 construct from −459 to +675. By using this construct as a template after digestion with SacI, T3 RNA polymerase, and the RNA transcription kit (Stratagene), a synthetic GluR1 cRNA was synthesized that included the GluR1 5′ sequence from −459 and 56-bp 5′ linker sequence (named control RNA-1). Control RNA-2 was made from GluR1 cDNA with a 5′ end 266 bp upstream of the ATG (Ref. 18Hollmann M. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Rogers S.W. Heinemann S. Nature. 1989; 342: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar and see Fig. 2). For transfection and luciferase assays, fragments of the 5′-flanking regions of the thymidine kinase (TK), GluR1, and GluR2 genes were cloned into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega) in front of the firefly luciferase reporter gene using restriction sites or PCR cloning withPfu polymerase (CLONTECH). All resulting constructs were verified by sequencing. The BglII toHindIII fragment of the TK promoter was excised from the pRL-TK vector (Promega) and cloned into pGL3. The GluR2 promoter (−1253 to −111 relative to the first ATG or −822 to +320 relative to the main initiation site) was excised from the pGL2 construct (24Myers S.J. Peters J. Huang Y. Comer M.B. Barthel F. Dingledine R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6723-6739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using NheI and BglII and inserted into pGL3. PCR-amplified GluR1 fragments were cloned using SacI andBglII sites introduced in the primers. The 64-bp GA repeat in GluR1 was shortened during the PCR in some constructs to 62 bp (−743/+8, −459/−202, and −459/−48), 58 bp (−402/+8), or 36 bp (−459/+7deltaGA). No correlation between promoter activity and a 64- to 58-bp length of the GA repeat in different constructs was observed. In the −459/rev−48 construct, the region between −254 and −48 was inverted. This region was PCR-amplified with the upper primer containing a HindIII site and the downstream primer aBglII site. The PCR product was inserted in reverse orientation into the BglII and HindIII sites of the −459/−253 construct. For a list of constructs see Fig. 3. Putative CRE sites were mutated by a PCR mutagenesis strategy (20Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho N.S. Pullen K.J. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar) introducing different restriction sites as follows: 243SpeI, −208 NsiI, −151 NdeI, and −84EcoRV. During this process −219A was mutated unintentionally to T. As a positive control for CREB activity, we used a vector that contained eight CRE sites from the intragenic inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) promoter upstream of the interleukin 2 promoter and luciferase (21Abbott K.L.

For primer extension analysis and RNase protection assays, poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from adult male rat brains according to Verdoorn and Dingledine (22Verdoorn T. Dingledine R. Mol.

The following oligonucleotides were used for primer extension analysis (bottom strand, all relative to the first ATG, see Fig. 1): PE-A, −187 to −216; PE-B, −155 to −184; PE-C, −31 to −48; PE-D, +13 to −5; PE-E, −427 to −455. 100 ng of each HPLC-purified oligonucleotide was end-labeled using 30 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The radiolabeled primers (specific activity ∼5 × 108 cpm/µg) were hybridized for 2 h at 65 °C to 50 µg of poly(A)+ whole brain RNA (∼3 × 106 cpm of primer) or 20 ng of synthetic GluR1 control RNA (∼106 cpm of primer) with 10 µg of yeast total RNA in 150 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA. The mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature and precipitated with ethanol. Reverse transcription was carried out for 1 h at 42 °C with 200 units of Superscript II (RNase H-free, Life Technologies, Inc.) in first strand synthesis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2) using 625 µm of each dNTP and 5 ng/µl actinomycin D. After ethanol precipitation the reaction products were analyzed on a 5% acrylamide, 8 murea sequencing gel using sequencing reactions as markers. DNA templates for the antisense probes were cloned into pBluescript KS(−) (probe A, −870 to −88; probe B, −1398 to −184) and linearized with EcoRI at −454. Antisense RNA probe was synthesized from 0.5 µg of linearized template DNA by T7 polymerase and the Stratagene RNA transcription kit using the supplied transcription buffer, 500 µm ATP, UTP, and GTP each, 12 mm dithiothreitol, 33 units of RNAsin (Promega), 100 µCi of [µ-32P]CTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 800 Ci/mmol) at 37 °C for 1 h. 2 units of DNase I (Epicentre) were added for 15 min at 37 °C to destroy the DNA template. Template A gave rise to a complementary GluR1 RNA from −454 to −88 (Fig. 2, A and C), and probe B covered −454 to −184. The probes were purified on a 5% acrylamide, 8m urea gel and eluted at 37 °C for 2 h into the buffer supplied by the RPA 2 kit (Ambion). The specific activity of the probes was about 1.6 × 109 cpm/µg. 2 × 106 cpm probe was mixed with the different RNA samples (10 µg of poly(A)+ rat adult whole brain RNA, 2 ng of GluR1 control RNA in 10 µg of total yeast RNA, or 10 µg of total yeast RNA alone) in hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 100 mmsodium citrate, pH 6.4, 300 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA), denatured for 3–4 min at 90 ± 5 °C, and hybridized overnight at 45 °C. The single-stranded RNA was then digested with 0.5 units of RNase A and 20 units of RNase T1 per reaction at 37 °C for 30 min in the supplied digestion buffer. The reaction was stopped with the supplied solution, precipitated with ethanol after adding 20 µg of additional yeast RNA, and analyzed on a 5% acrylamide, 8 m urea sequencing gel using sequencing reactions as size markers. Nuclear extracts were prepared from embryonic rat forebrain cultures maintained for 5–9 days in vitro according to Harant et al.(23Harant H. de Martin R. Andrew P.J. Foglar E. Dittrich C. Lindley I.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26954-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Annealed oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [α-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and were subsequently purified by PAGE. Gel slices were incubated overnight in TE buffer, and the probe was separated from the gel by centrifugation in microcon columns (Amicon) and elution in water. In vitrobinding reactions were conducted for 20 min at room temperature in a 20-µl volume containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl (Sp1 and some c-Jun experiments), or 25 mm NaCl (CREB experiments), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 µg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 2.5 µg of bovine serum albumin, and 20,000–40,000 cpm probe. Adding nuclear extracts in the Sp1 experiments increased the salt concentration up to 70 mmNaCl and 7 mm KCl. In some experiments competitor oligonucleotides (10-, 30- or 100-fold of the amount of labeled probe) were included. When needed, 4 µg of anti-Sp1 or anti-c-Jun polyclonal rabbit IgG antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were preincubated with nuclear extracts on ice for 30 min. 2 µg of nuclear extracts or one of the following recombinant proteins were added to start the reaction, 0.2 footprinting units (fpu) of human Sp1, 0.3 footprinting units of human c-Jun (both Promega), or 0.5 µg of human CREB1-bZIP corresponding to amino acids 254–327, which contained the DNA binding and dimerization domain (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The DNA-protein complexes were separated on non-denaturing 6% PAGE, 0.5× TBE gels (Fig. 5, assays concerning Sp1 and some c-Jun binding), or Tris glycine, 8% PAGE gels (Fig. 6, assays using CREB-bZip and some assays with c-Jun protein), run at 4 °C for 1.5–3 h. Dried gels were exposed to Kodak X-Omat films for visualization. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes are as follows (top strand only): Sp1 consensus, ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC; CREB consensus, AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG; and AP1 consensus, CGCTTGATGAGTCA- GCCGGAA.Figure 6CREB binding to GluR1 sites. A, binding of recombinant CREB-bZIP to various GluR1 oligonucleotides named by their 5′ ends was tested by EMSA. Data shown are representative of three experiments. B, the CRE sites identified in A (positions shown) were mutated in the −334/+8 construct. B and C, the function of CRE sites was assessed by transfection of cortical cultures with the wild type (WT, −334/+8) or mutated construct (m4) and the full-length GluR1 promoter (−5035 to +8), and stimulating with 10 µm forskolin and 500 µm IBMX (n = 5). Promoter activity was normalized to that of parallel cultures treated with 10 µm dideoxyforskolin (100%). No difference between the mutated and the wild type constructs was observed. The IL2 promoter with 8 CRE sites from the ICER promoter was stimulated to 436 and 506% of control under the same conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The GluR1 oligonucleotides were named by their 5′ end, and sequences containing one or more putative SP1 sites are underlined: −332a, AACACGGGAGGGTGAGAGAGG; −296, TAGAGAAGAGGAGGAGAGCAGAGG; −275, AGGGAGAGGGGGAGCGAGCTAGCG; −244, CATGAGGACGGGCTGCTCAA; −232, CTGCTCCCGGCTCAGTTAATCTGGC (AP1 half-site is in boldface).

The procedures were slightly modified from Myers et al. (24Myers S.J. Peters J. Huang Y. Comer M.B. Barthel F. Dingledine R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6723-6739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary mixed neuronal-glial cell cultures (referred to as “forebrain cultures”) were prepared from E18 to E19 rat cortex with striatum. For transfections, the dissociated cells were plated into 12-well culture dishes (Falcon or Costar) precoated overnight with 180 µg/ml poly-d-lysine and grown in defined serum-free DMEM supplemented with B27 (both Life Technologies, Inc.), which enhances neuronal survival. The cultures were transfected on days 4–7, when counting of immunolabeled cultures grown on glass coverslips revealed about 3% GFAP-positive cells and 65% MAP2-positive cells. Primary glial cultures were obtained from the primary forebrain cultures by changing the medium to DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, which induced neuronal cell death as described by Myers et al. (24Myers S.J. Peters J. Huang Y. Comer M.B. Barthel F. Dingledine R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6723-6739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When glial cells were confluent they were trypsinized and replated into 12-well dishes for transfection. Immunolabeling showed about 90% GFAP-positive cells in these cultures. Visually, the contaminating cells appeared to be progenitor cells, microglia, and some oligodendrocytes. For transfection, cells in each well were incubated with 1 µg of each construct in 6 µl of Plus reagent mixed with 4 µl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.5 ml of minimal serum-free medium (DMEM supplemented with 0.5 µm insulin, 100 µg/ml human apotransferrin, 0.03 µm selenium, and 60 µmputrescine, all Sigma) per well. After 3–5 h, 0.5 ml of fresh minimal serum-free medium was added to forebrain cultures, or DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum was added to glial cultures. After 24 h cells were harvested for luciferase assays in 150 µl of lysis buffer (Promega) per well or fixed and immunostained (as in Ref. 24Myers S.J. Peters J. Huang Y. Comer M.B. Barthel F. Dingledine R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6723-6739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments assessing CRE sites, cortical cultures were used, and the DNA-LipofectAMINE Plus mixture was replaced after 3–5 h with 1 ml of fresh minimal serum-free medium containing glutamate receptor blockers (30 µm 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, 20 µm MK801, 100 µmD(-)2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid). 24 h later, 100 µl of 10× drug solution in medium was added for 18 h until lysis. Luciferase activity was determined on 20-µl samples with a Turner Designs luminometer using 85 µl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) per sample. At least three independent plasmid preparations for each construct were transfected in triplicates or quadruplets in at least three different primary cultures. All luciferase activity values were normalized to the activity of the TK promoter after subtracting the activity of the promoter-less pGL3 basic vector, which were both transfected in parallel plates of the same culture preparation. Alternatively, when promoter activity of GluR1 constructs was expressed as a ratio to that of the empty pGL3 vector, similar results were obtained. Luciferase activity of the pGL3 vector was 16 times lower in glial cultures compared with forebrain cultures; luciferase driven only by the pGL3 vector gave an average of 12 ± 2.4 Turner light units (TLU) per well (mean ± S.E.,n = 34) in glial cultures versus 194 ± 28.5 TLU (n = 41) in forebrain cultures. The TK promoter activity per well was 10,600 ± 2000 TLU for forebrain cultures (n = 43) and 538 ± 94.5 TLU for glial cultures (n = 48). To measure the neuronal specificity of GluR1 promoter constructs, which mainly expressed luciferase in neurons (see Table I), we assessed neuronal specificity (N/G) relative to the TK promoter by calculating the ratio of neuronal to glial expression after normalization to the TK promoter. This N/G ratio is only used as a tool to compare the neuronal specificity of different GluR1 promoter fragments, but it underestimates the actual neuronal specificity since the TK promoter itself was expressed at higher levels on a per cell basis in the forebrain cultures. By taking the average transfection efficiency of forebrain (0.75%) and glial (7%) cultures and an estimated 5 times higher cell density in the forebrain cultures into account, the “neuronal” to glial activity ratio for the TK promoter per cell is about 37.Table IImmunostaining of transfected cells in rat forebrain culturesConstructs209/+7−2349/+8−459/−48MAP2 stainingLuciferase-positive cells244150629% MAP2-positive or clear neuronal morphology969692GFAP-stainingLuciferase-positive cells76150141% GFAP-positive000Forebrain cultures grown on coverslips were transfected with three different GluR1 promoter constructs. 24 h later cells were fixed and double-stained for expression of luciferase and MAP2 or GFAP, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Forebrain cultures grown on coverslips were transfected with three different GluR1 promoter constructs. 24 h later cells were fixed and double-stained for expression of luciferase and MAP2 or GFAP, respectively. Some luciferase-positive cells (9%) appeared to be MAP2-negative, but their morphology was clearly neuronal, as observed by luciferase staining in several long (>400 µm) branching processes containing varicosities. For all statistical comparisons GraphPad Prizm was used. An analysis of variance was performed followed by a post hoc Bonferroni test with selected pairs to compare neighboring constructs. To compare all constructs to each other a post hoc Tukey test was employed. When only two samples were in one group (−2349/+8versus −2349/−253 and −459/−48 versus−459/rev−48) the unpaired t test was used. The sequence of the 5′-proximal region and 593 nucleotides of the first intron of the rat GluR1 gene is shown in Fig. 1. All numbering refers to the first ATG, and some important features are highlighted within the sequence. The exon-intron borders of the first two introns were determined from sequence comparison of the genomic clone and the published GluR1 cDNA (18Hollmann M. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Rogers S.W. Heinemann S. Nature. 1989; 342: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). This comparison revealed a discrepancy between the two sequences in the 5′-untranslated region. In the rat genomic sequence, the CAAGAGAAA sequence (at −161 relative to the first ATG) only occurs once, whereas it is repeated in tandem in the mouse GluR1 gene (Celera data base) and the rat cDNA (Fig. 1, overscored). This difference might be due to genetic variation among rats. The first intron of about 2.8 kb is inserted after 82 bp of translated sequence, and the second intron is located after the 138-bp-long exon 2. In the 5′ region the rat GluR1 gene harbors a 96-bp ACAT tetranucleotide repeat at −4815 and at −4309 a B2-like repetitive sequence (25Lueders K.K. Paterson B.M Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7715-7729Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) of 210 bp including typical 15-bp terminal direct repeats. The function of a 64-bp GA repeat between −394 and −333 is examined further below. The initiation region is GC-rich but lacks convincing TATA and CCAAT elements. Multiple initiation sites were identified by primer extension analysis using five different primers and poly(A)+ brain RNA (Fig. 2 A, B). Nonspecific termination of the reverse transcriptase was monitored using synthetic GluR1 control RNAs with known length (* in Fig.2 B). Primers PE-A, PE-B, and PE-D (PE-D not shown) gave rise to main DNA products identifying transcriptional start sites near −295 and −266 (Figs. 1 and 2; sites denoted as A andB). Extension of primers PE-B, PE-C, and PE-D (PE-D not shown) resulted in bands at −219 and −214 (sites C andD) and primers PE-C (Fig. 2 A) and PE-D (not shown) labeled −202 (site E). The matching results from different primers confirmed the absence of a−161CAAGAGAAA repeat in brain RNA of Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats. Another primer PE-E starting further upstream at −427 did not give rise to any DNA product (not shown); thus it was unlikely that there were more 5′-initiation sites. RNase protection assays were performed to confirm primer extension analysis. Probe A revealed all the RNA ends found by primer extension (Fig. 2 C), and probe B, which was located more upstream, reconfirmed sites A and B (not shown). Two faint bands found by RNase protection and primer extension assays with primers PE-A and -B, revealing possible start sites flanking the GA repeat at −333 and −394, were not labeled in Figs. 1 and 2. A number of other fainter bands appeared in these gels but were not consistently identified by the various primers and probes, so they were not considered further. Thus, RNase protection assays with two probes of different length confirmed all main initiation sites found by primer extension (−295, −266, −219, −214, and −202) and ruled out introns in the 5′-untranslated region. Promoter activity of different GluR1 and GluR2 fragments cloned into the pGL3 vector was assessed by measuring firefly luciferase activity after transfection into primary forebrain and glial cultures. To compare promoter activities across experiments, we normalized all luciferase activities to the TK promoter. GluR1 promoter activity was strongest in forebrain cultures for the construct that contained all transcriptional start sites and the 64-bp GA repeat but lacked the region with the first two upstream ATGs in the 5′-untranslated region (construct −459/−48, 3′-deletion series of Fig. 3). In glial cultures the C, D, and E initiation sites were not essential because highest promoter activity was produced by construct −459/−253. The shortest GluR1 promoter construct tested (−209/+8), with only one main transcriptional start site (E at −202), lacked activity in glial cultures and had one of the lowest activity of all constructs in forebrain cultures (18% of TK promoter activity). All examined GluR1 promoter constructs showed higher activity in forebrain compared with glial cultures. To determine whether luciferase was expressed primarily in neurons or glial cells, and whether there is heterogeneity in the glial cultures, we transfected both forebrain and glial cultures with GluR1 promoter constructs on glass coverslips and double-immunostained with antibodies directed against luciferase and either the neuronal marker, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), or the astrocyte marker, glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP). In forebrain cultures, most luciferase-posi"

However, the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the gene has not yet been established. In vitrotranscription assays of the mlc gene showed that P2 promoter could be recognized by RNA polymerase containing the heat shock sigma factor ς32 (Eς32) as well as Eς70, while P1 promoter is only recognized by Eς70. The cyclic AMP receptor protein and cyclic AMP complex (CRP·cAMP) increased expression from P2 but showed negative effect on transcription from P1 by Eς70, although it had little effect on transcription from P2 by Eς32 in vitro. Purified Mlc repressed transcription from both promoters, but with different degrees of inhibition. In vivotranscription assays using wild type and mlc strains indicated that the level of mlc expression was modulated less than 2-fold by glucose in the medium with concerted action of CRP·cAMP and Mlc. A dramatic increase in mlc expression was observed upon heat shock or in cells overexpressing ς32, confirming that Eς32 is involved in the expression of mlc. Induction of ptsG P1 andpts P0 transcription by glucose was also dependent on Eς32. These results indicate that Eς32 plays an important role in balancing the relative concentration of Mlc and EIICBGlc in response to availability of glucose in order to maintain inducibility of the Mlc regulon at high growth temperature.

Cells. 1998; 8: 614-617PubMed Google Scholar) as is expected for a system as central to carbohydrate metabolism as the PTS. In this work, we studied the transcriptional regulation of the mlc gene in vitro as well as in vivo and the role of Eς32 in maintaining glucose-dependent induction of the Mlc regulon at high growth temperature.DISCUSSIONIt has been suggested that the mlc gene has two promoters, P1 and P2, which are separated by 12 bases and autoregulated by its product (2Decker K. Plumbridge J. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here, we report that the transcription of themlc gene is regulated in a highly sophisticated manner and that heat shock ς factor, ς32, is involved in its transcription.It is known that the expression level of several genes encoding transcriptional repressors such as galS (33Weickrt M.J. Adhya S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 251-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),nagC (34Plumbridge J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2629-2636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), purR (35Meng L.M. Kilstrup M.

A. 1982; 79: 3120-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) ofE. coli is low and that their expression level is not modulated much in various growth conditions. It seems likely that both CRP·cAMP and Mlc work together in E. coli to maintain the level of Mlc optimum in response to availability of glucose. All genes known to be regulated negatively by Mlc, such as manXYZ,malT, ptsG, and pts, are also regulated positively by CRP·cAMP (2Decker K. Plumbridge J. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 3Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol.

Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 319-399Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In vitrotranscription assay with Eς70 and CRP·cAMP showed two opposite effects on each promoter of mlc, that is the positive effect on P2 and the negative effect on P1 (Fig. 2). This can be explained based on the fact that the CRP-binding site of P2 centered at −71.5 to the transcription start site is more compatible for a functional CRP site (37Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges H. Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) compared with that of P1 centered at −58.5 to the transcription start site. However, Eς32-directed P2 transcription was insensitive to CRP·cAMP. The P2 promoter of mlc should be a good model system to assess the effect of ς factor on transcription activation by CRP·cAMP because it has been known that CRP·cAMP activates transcription by direct protein-protein interaction with the α-subunit of RNA polymerase (38Busby S. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar).Repression of the P2 transcription when cells were grown in the presence of glucose implies that the action of CRP·cAMP is dominant over the self-repression by Mlc in the regulation of the mlcP2 promoter. The low binding affinity of Mlc to its own promoter that is 10 times weaker than that to ptsG or pts P0 promoters (9Nam T.W. Cho S.H. Shin D. Kim J.H. Jeong J.Y. Lee J.H. Roe J.H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.O. Ryu S. Seok Y.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) seems to be a major reason for the low influence of Mlc on regulation of its own gene. In vitro transcription assay revealed that each promoter of mlc has a different sensitivity to Mlc (Fig. 3). When cells were grown in the absence of glucose, a similar level of expression from both P1 and P2 was observed even though the P2 transcription is more sensitive to Mlc repression probably because the intracellular concentration of Mlc is limiting inE. coli (3Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The condition seems to be similar to thein vitro transcription condition where both CRP·cAMP and a small amount of Mlc were present as shown in lane 6 of Fig.3 A. However, P1 was as active as P2 when the mlcstrain was grown in the absence of glucose. These results imply that the concentration of intracellular CRP·cAMP is lower than that of CRP·cAMP used for in vitro transcription reactions (40 nm) (39Ishizuka H. Hanamura A. Kunimura T. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). When Mlc was induced and the concentration of CRP·cAMP was lowered by the addition of glucose in the growth medium, the P1 promoter was activated slightly while the P2 promoter was repressed because the P2 promoter is active only in the presence of CRP·cAMP. This situation is similar to the in vitrotranscription condition where neither CRP·cAMP nor Mlc were present (lane 1 of Fig. 3 A). Therefore, the addition of glucose in the growth medium resulted in the reduction ofmlc expression by about half. These results also agree with the previous report by Decker et al. (2Decker K. Plumbridge J. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that expression ofmlc is reduced by half when cells were grown in the presence of glucose by measuring the β-galactosidase activity of themlc-lacZ fusion. Level of Mlc expression can vary precisely in response to the available sugars but the variation range is less than 2-fold in that the availability of unphosphorylated EIICBGlc may be more critical than the intracellular level of Mlc for induction of the Mlc regulon by glucose as shown in our previous report (9Nam T.W. Cho S.H. Shin D. Kim J.H. Jeong J.Y. Lee J.H. Roe J.H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.O. Ryu S. Seok Y.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Eς32 is involved in the transcription of themlc gene. In vitro transcription assay with Eς32 showed that Eς32 could recognize the P2 promoter of the mlc gene. Transcription of P2 was increased when ς32 was overexpressed (Fig.4 A). Moreover, mlc expression was increased upon heat shock. It is known that the intracellular concentration of ς32 in E. coli increases from 15–20-fold within 5 min then declines to a new steady-state level severalfold higher than the preshift level in response to temperature shift from 30 to 42 °C (20Yura T. Nagami H. Mori H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 321-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 32Straus D.B. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Nature. 1987; 329: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Transcription from P2 recognized by Eς32 was induced transiently to an extraordinary level upon heat shock when cells were grown in the absence of glucose (Fig.4 B, lane 4). The level of mlctranscription was changed parallel to the changes in intracellular concentration of ς32. In addition, P2 transcription was activated upon heat shock even when cells were grown in the presence of glucose. These results imply that the major RNA polymerase which activated the P2 transcription upon heat shock was Eς32because Eς32 was less sensitive to Mlc than Eς70 and the P2 transcription by Eς32 was not dependent on CRP·cAMP as revealed by the in vitrotranscription assay (Fig. 3). It is not clear why the P1 transcription was reduced in the ΔrpoH strain and activated by heat shock or when cells overexpressing ς32 were grown in the presence of glucose even though P1 promoter was not recognized by Eς32 in vitro. Because heat shock should exert pleiotropic effects by regulating transcription of various genes (21Chuang S.E. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5242-5252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), further study on the mechanism of heat shock is needed for a better understanding of these phenomena.To investigate whether the increased level of mlc expression resulting from heat shock can influence Mlc-dependent gene expression, we analyzed changes in ptsG expression by heat shock. The P1 expression of ptsG was increased significantly by heat shock only when cells were grown in the presence of glucose regardless of the presence of Mlc (Fig. 5 A). These results suggest that activation of ptsG P1 by heat shock was not mediated by Mlc or CRP·cAMP even though Mlc repression might be dominant over activation of ptsG P1 by heat shock. We have reported that the unphosphorylated form of EIICBGlcsequesters Mlc from its target promoters upon glucose uptake by direct protein-protein interaction (9Nam T.W. Cho S.H. Shin D. Kim J.H. Jeong J.Y. Lee J.H. Roe J.H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.O. Ryu S. Seok Y.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, glucose is required to maximize the level of dephosphorylated EIICBGlc necessary to sequester Mlc that is increased by heat shock. However, contrary to the case of mlc P2 transcription in which Eς32plays a major role in its regulation, it is likely that additional factors independent of Eς32 are involved in regulation of the ptsG expression because ptsG P1 expression was increased partially upon heat shock even in theΔrpoH strain grown in the presence of glucose. It means that two separate mechanisms involving Eς32-dependent and Eς32-indendent activation of ptsG P1 may work additively for full activation of ptsG P1 by glucose when cells were heat-shocked. The importance of Eς32 in glucose induction of the Mlc regulon was manifested by the fact that glucose induction of ptsG could not be observed in theΔrpoH strain. The inability of glucose to activate ptsG expression resulted in an insensitivity of thepts P0 promoter to glucose in ΔrpoHstrain. We are trying to elucidate the mechanism of activation ofptsG transcription by heat shock in the absence of Eς32 in order to understand the general role of Eς32 in regulation of genes involving carbohydrate metabolism. When Mlc is overproduced on a multicopy plasmid inEscherichia coli grown in the presence of glucose, it causes reduction of acetate accumulation and E. coli makes large colonies (1Hosono K. Kakuda H. Ichihara S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mlc has been proposed to be a new global regulator of carbohydrate metabolism (2Decker K. Plumbridge J. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 3Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol.

Microbiol. 1998; 27: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Moreover, ptsGencoding enzyme IICB of the glucose PTS (EIICBGlc) and thepts operon encoding general PTS proteins also proved to be repressed by Mlc (3Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 5Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6Kim S.Y. Nam T.W. Shin D.

The Mlc regulon is also under the positive control of the CRP1·cAMP complex. It has been discovered that repression of the Mlc regulon is relieved in cells grown in the media containing glucose or other PTS sugars (7Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the unphosphorylated EIICBGlc can sequester Mlc from its binding sites by direct protein-protein interaction to induce expression of the Mlc regulon in response to glucose (9Nam T.W. Cho S.H. Shin D. Kim J.H. Jeong J.Y. Lee J.H. Roe J.H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.O. Ryu S. Seok Y.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10Tanaka Y. Kimata K. Aiba H.

The mlc gene encoding a 44-kDa Mlc protein is located around 35 min of chromosomal locus (1Hosono K. Kakuda H. Ichihara S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This gene was also identified as the same allele of the dgsA gene (4Plumbridge J. Mol.

Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have shown that mlc transcription starts from two promoters called upstream “+1” and downstream “+13” and there exists one Mlc-binding site centered at +16. In addition, a highly conserved CRP-binding site is present within the mlcpromoter. However, the detailed mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of mlc have not yet been reported. The majority of the E. coli promoters are recognized by the RNA polymerase containing the housekeeping sigma factor, ς70 (14Ishihama A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 499-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 15Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Several genes that are necessary to respond to various environmental or nutritional changes require specific recognition by RNA polymerase associated with the alternative sigma factors, ς32 (16Grossman A.D. Erickson J.W. Gross C.A. Cell. 1984; 38: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), ςE (17Erickson J.W. Gross C.A.

The heat shock response in E. coli is mediated by Eς32 (20Yura T. Nagami H. Mori H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 321-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and it is known that expression of at least 26 genes is induced by heat shock in E. coli (21Chuang S.E. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5242-5252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many essential genes in E. coli have multiple promoters including one recognized by Eς32 in order to respond to various environmental conditions (22Charpentier B. Branlant C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 830-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Newland J.T. Gaal T. Mecsas J. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 661-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ryu S. Ramsier T.M.

Therefore, glucose is required to maximize the level of dephosphorylated EIICBGlc necessary to sequester Mlc that is increased by heat shock. However, contrary to the case of mlc P2 transcription in which Eς32plays a major role in its regulation, it is likely that additional factors independent of Eς32 are involved in regulation of the ptsG expression because ptsG P1 expression was increased partially upon heat shock even in theΔrpoH strain grown in the presence of glucose. It means that two separate mechanisms involving Eς32-dependent and Eς32-indendent activation of ptsG P1 may work additively for full activation of ptsG P1 by glucose when cells were heat-shocked. The importance of Eς32 in glucose induction of the Mlc regulon was manifested by the fact that glucose induction of ptsG could not be observed in theΔrpoH strain. The inability of glucose to activate ptsG expression resulted in an insensitivity of thepts P0 promoter to glucose in ΔrpoHstrain. We are trying to elucidate the mechanism of activation ofptsG transcription by heat shock in the absence of Eς32 in order to understand the general role of Eς32 in regulation of genes involving carbohydrate metabolism. It has been suggested that the mlc gene has two promoters, P1 and P2, which are separated by 12 bases and autoregulated by its product (2Decker K. Plumbridge J. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here, we report that the transcription of themlc gene is regulated in a highly sophisticated manner and that heat shock ς factor, ς32, is involved in its transcription. It is known that the expression level of several genes encoding transcriptional repressors such as galS (33Weickrt M.J. Adhya S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 251-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),nagC (34Plumbridge J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2629-2636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), purR (35Meng L.M. Kilstrup M. Nygaard P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and trpR (36Kelley R.L. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3120-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) ofE. coli is low and that their expression level is not modulated much in various growth conditions. It seems likely that both CRP·cAMP and Mlc work together in E. coli to maintain the level of Mlc optimum in response to availability of glucose. All genes known to be regulated negatively by Mlc, such as manXYZ,malT, ptsG, and pts, are also regulated positively by CRP·cAMP (2Decker K. Plumbridge J. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 3Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol.

Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 319-399Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In vitrotranscription assay with Eς70 and CRP·cAMP showed two opposite effects on each promoter of mlc, that is the positive effect on P2 and the negative effect on P1 (Fig. 2). This can be explained based on the fact that the CRP-binding site of P2 centered at −71.5 to the transcription start site is more compatible for a functional CRP site (37Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges H. Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) compared with that of P1 centered at −58.5 to the transcription start site. However, Eς32-directed P2 transcription was insensitive to CRP·cAMP. The P2 promoter of mlc should be a good model system to assess the effect of ς factor on transcription activation by CRP·cAMP because it has been known that CRP·cAMP activates transcription by direct protein-protein interaction with the α-subunit of RNA polymerase (38Busby S. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Repression of the P2 transcription when cells were grown in the presence of glucose implies that the action of CRP·cAMP is dominant over the self-repression by Mlc in the regulation of the mlcP2 promoter. The low binding affinity of Mlc to its own promoter that is 10 times weaker than that to ptsG or pts P0 promoters (9Nam T.W. Cho S.H. Shin D. Kim J.H. Jeong J.Y. Lee J.H. Roe J.H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.O. Ryu S. Seok Y.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) seems to be a major reason for the low influence of Mlc on regulation of its own gene. In vitro transcription assay revealed that each promoter of mlc has a different sensitivity to Mlc (Fig. 3). When cells were grown in the absence of glucose, a similar level of expression from both P1 and P2 was observed even though the P2 transcription is more sensitive to Mlc repression probably because the intracellular concentration of Mlc is limiting inE. coli (3Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The condition seems to be similar to thein vitro transcription condition where both CRP·cAMP and a small amount of Mlc were present as shown in lane 6 of Fig.3 A. However, P1 was as active as P2 when the mlcstrain was grown in the absence of glucose. These results imply that the concentration of intracellular CRP·cAMP is lower than that of CRP·cAMP used for in vitro transcription reactions (40 nm) (39Ishizuka H. Hanamura A. Kunimura T. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). When Mlc was induced and the concentration of CRP·cAMP was lowered by the addition of glucose in the growth medium, the P1 promoter was activated slightly while the P2 promoter was repressed because the P2 promoter is active only in the presence of CRP·cAMP. This situation is similar to the in vitrotranscription condition where neither CRP·cAMP nor Mlc were present (lane 1 of Fig. 3 A). Therefore, the addition of glucose in the growth medium resulted in the reduction ofmlc expression by about half. These results also agree with the previous report by Decker et al. (2Decker K. Plumbridge J. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that expression ofmlc is reduced by half when cells were grown in the presence of glucose by measuring the β-galactosidase activity of themlc-lacZ fusion. Level of Mlc expression can vary precisely in response to the available sugars but the variation range is less than 2-fold in that the availability of unphosphorylated EIICBGlc may be more critical than the intracellular level of Mlc for induction of the Mlc regulon by glucose as shown in our previous report (9Nam T.W. Cho S.H. Shin D. Kim J.H. Jeong J.Y. Lee J.H. Roe J.H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.O. Ryu S. Seok Y.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Eς32 is involved in the transcription of themlc gene. In vitro transcription assay with Eς32 showed that Eς32 could recognize the P2 promoter of the mlc gene. Transcription of P2 was increased when ς32 was overexpressed (Fig.4 A). Moreover, mlc expression was increased upon heat shock. It is known that the intracellular concentration of ς32 in E. coli increases from 15–20-fold within 5 min then declines to a new steady-state level severalfold higher than the preshift level in response to temperature shift from 30 to 42 °C (20Yura T. Nagami H. Mori H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 321-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 32Straus D.B. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Nature. 1987; 329: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Transcription from P2 recognized by Eς32 was induced transiently to an extraordinary level upon heat shock when cells were grown in the absence of glucose (Fig.4 B, lane 4). The level of mlctranscription was changed parallel to the changes in intracellular concentration of ς32. In addition, P2 transcription was activated upon heat shock even when cells were grown in the presence of glucose. These results imply that the major RNA polymerase which activated the P2 transcription upon heat shock was Eς32because Eς32 was less sensitive to Mlc than Eς70 and the P2 transcription by Eς32 was not dependent on CRP·cAMP as revealed by the in vitrotranscription assay (Fig. 3). It is not clear why the P1 transcription was reduced in the ΔrpoH strain and activated by heat shock or when cells overexpressing ς32 were grown in the presence of glucose even though P1 promoter was not recognized by Eς32 in vitro. Because heat shock should exert pleiotropic effects by regulating transcription of various genes (21Chuang S.E. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5242-5252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), further study on the mechanism of heat shock is needed for a better understanding of these phenomena. To investigate whether the increased level of mlc expression resulting from heat shock can influence Mlc-dependent gene expression, we analyzed changes in ptsG expression by heat shock. The P1 expression of ptsG was increased significantly by heat shock only when cells were grown in the presence of glucose regardless of the presence of Mlc (Fig. 5 A). These results suggest that activation of ptsG P1 by heat shock was not mediated by Mlc or CRP·cAMP even though Mlc repression might be dominant over activation of ptsG P1 by heat shock. We have reported that the unphosphorylated form of EIICBGlcsequesters Mlc from its target promoters upon glucose uptake by direct protein-protein interaction (9Nam T.W. Cho S.H. Shin D. Kim J.H. Jeong J.Y. Lee J.H. Roe J.H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.O. Ryu S. Seok Y.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, glucose is required to maximize the level of dephosphorylated EIICBGlc necessary to sequester Mlc that is increased by heat shock.

We prepared Et-3,4-dephostatin as a stable analogue and found it to inhibit PTP-1B and SHPTP-1 protein-tyrosine phosphatases selectively but not to inhibit CD45 and leukocyte common antigen-related phosphatase ones effectively. Et-3,4-dephostatin increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 with or without insulin in differentiated 3T3-L1 mouse adipocytes. The increase of tyrosine phosphorylation by Et-3,4-dephostatin was more prominent in 6-h than in 30-min incubation. It also increased phosphorylation and activation of Akt with or without insulin. Et-3,4-dephostatin also enhanced translocation of glucose transporter 4 from the cytoplasm to the membrane and 2-deoxy-glucose transport. Et-3,4-dephostatin-induced glucose uptake was inhibited by SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, but not by PD98059, a MEK inhibitor, or by cycloheximide as insulin-induced uptake. Interestingly, although LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, inhibited the insulin-induced glucose uptake completely, it only partially inhibited the Et-3,4-dephostatin-induced uptake. It also blocked insulin-induced glucose transporter 4 translocation but not the Et-3,4-dephostatin-induced one. The increase in c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation caused by Et-3,4-dephostatin was stronger than that in insulin receptor phosphorylation. These observations indicate that a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent pathway involving c-Cbl is more important in Et-3,4-dephostatin-induced glucose uptake than in insulin-induced uptake. Et-3,4-dephostatin showed an in vivo antidiabetic effect in terms of reducing the high blood glucose level in KK-Ay mice after oral administration.

Zaitsev S.V. Zhivotovsky B. Köhler M. Efendic S. Orrenius S. Berggren P.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33501-33507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar)). A functional insulin receptor was also shown to be essential for the secretion of insulin by cultured mouse β-cells (8Kulkarni R.N. Brüning J.C. Winnay J.N. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar).Thiazolidine derivatives such as troglitazone are being or have been widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (9Mimura K.

Troglitazone is a ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ that transcriptionally regulates a number of adipose tissue-specific genes by binding to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response elements of these genes as a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor. These heterodimers potentiate adipose tissue differentiation in vivo (10Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 907-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and their side effects include obesity. Several drugs such as sulfonylureas enhance insulin secretion. Sulfonylureas bind to receptors on pancreatic β-cells to induce Ca2+ influx, thereby increasing insulin secretion (11Fujitani S. Ikenoue T. Akiyoshi M. Maki T. Yada T. Metabolism. 1996; 45: 184-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Compared with the insulin therapy for type I diabetes mellitus, chemotherapy for type 2 has been poorly developed, and less toxic chemotherapy based on the insulin receptor-associated signal transduction should be developed.The insulin receptor is a heterotetramer consisting of two α-subunits that are entirely extracellular and two β-subunits that span the plasma membrane and contain intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (12Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of insulin to its receptor results in activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase and receptor autophosphorylation, followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, -2, and -3, which then bind to the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI)1 3-kinase. Then the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase produces phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,3-trisphosphate, which can bind to the PH domain of PKBα(β)/Akt1(2), which then up-regulate glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation. These Akts are phosphorylated to become activated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 or 2 (14Franke T. Kaplan D. Cantley L. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). The insulin-stimulated phosphorylations of Akt on threonine 308 by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 and on serine 473 by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 2 are required for maximal Akt activity (15Alessi D.R.

Pilch P.F. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 529-546PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in an increase in cellular glucose uptake (20Abel E.D. Houseknecht K.L. Kahn B.B. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1995; 2: 313-324Crossref Google Scholar). On the other hand, very recently, Pessin and co-workers (21Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bicket P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) showed the existence of a PI 3-kinase-independent c-Cbl pathway in insulin-induced signal transduction. The c-Cbl protein is a proto-oncogene product that can be tyrosine-phosphorylated. The Cbl-associated protein forms complex with c-Cbl. This complex mediates GLUT4 translocation through the PI 3-kinase-independent pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (21Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bicket P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar).Several protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) have been identified in major insulin-sensitive tissues such as skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. These include transmembrane PTPases such as CD45 and leukocyte common antigen-related phosphatase (LAR)/RPTP-α and nontransmembrane PTPases such as SHPTP-1, SHPTP-2, PTP-1B, and PTP-1C (22Goldstein B.J. Receptor. 1993; 3: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar). Various PTPases are considered to be involved in the etiology of diabetes mellitus. Especially, PTP-1B, a cytoplasmic PTPase, is known to be a negative regulator of insulin receptor-associated signal transduction (23Kenner K.A. Anyanwu E. Olefsky J.M. Kusari J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19810-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). PTP1B-deficient mice showed increased insulin sensitivity and resistance to obesity (24Elchebly M.

Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PTP-1B in Rat1 fibroblasts is known to reduce ligand-stimulated autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor (23Kenner K.A. Anyanwu E. Olefsky J.M. Kusari J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19810-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibitors of PTP-1B may enhance the insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake .We previously isolated dephostatin from Streptomyces as a novel inhibitor of T-cell receptor-associated protein-tyrosine phosphatase CD45 (26Imoto M. Kakeya H. Sawa T. Hayashi C. Hamada M. Takeuchi T. Umezawa K. J. Antibiot. 1993; 46: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Since dephostatin was unstable in cell culture media, later we synthesized Me-3,4-dephostatin as a stable analogue (27Watanabe T. Takeuchi T. Otsuka M. Tanaka S. Umezawa K. J. Antibiot. 1995; 48: 1460-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Me-3,4-dephostatin was shown to enhance nerve growth factor- or epidermal growth factor-induced morphological differentiation in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 h cells (28Fujiwara S. Watanabe T. Nagatsu T. Gohda J. Imoto M. Umezawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This PTPase inhibitor prolonged the tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated state of MAP kinase. More recently, we synthesized Et-3,4-dephostatin as another stable analogue (29Watanabe T. Suzuki T. Umezawa Y. Takeuchi T. Otsuka M. Umezawa K. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 741-752Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar).In this report, we studied the effects of Et-3,4-dephostatin on tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, activation of Akt, GLUT4 translocation, and hexose transport. We found that Et-3,4-dephostatin mimicked or potentiated the various activities of insulin; especially, it activated the PI 3-kinase-independent signaling pathway. It also showed antidiabetic activity in mice.DISCUSSIONFew PTPase inhibitors have been used as biochemical tools except sodium vanadate. We previously developed Me-3,4-dephostatin as a stable analogue of dephostatin (27Watanabe T. Takeuchi T. Otsuka M. Tanaka S. Umezawa K. J. Antibiot. 1995; 48: 1460-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and showed it to enhance the effect of nerve growth factor and epidermal growth factor on differentiation of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 h cells (28Fujiwara S. Watanabe T. Nagatsu T. Gohda J. Imoto M. Umezawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that an additional stable analogue, Et-3,4-dephostatin, potentiated or mimicked the effect of insulin in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and showed an antidiabetic effect in vivo.First, we found that Et-3,4-dephostatin selectively inhibits PTP-1B and SHPTP-1, both of which are known to be involved in the regulation of the insulin receptor (22Goldstein B.J. Receptor. 1993; 3: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kenner K.A. Anyanwu E. Olefsky J.M. Kusari J. J. Biol.

The IC50 value for CD45 is larger than that in our previous report (27Watanabe T. Takeuchi T. Otsuka M. Tanaka S. Umezawa K. J. Antibiot. 1995; 48: 1460-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This difference occurred because we changed the enzyme source to a commercially available preparation from the crude preparation of Jurkat cell membranes. Et-3,4-dephostatin may inhibit other untested PTPases; therefore, involvement of PTPases other than PTP-1B and SHPTP-1 cannot be excluded in its cellular effects.Et-3,4-dephostatin increased the phosphorylation of Akt, GLUT4 translocation, and hexose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 4-O-Me-Et-3,4-dephostatin did not induce these phenotypic changes, indicating that these effects are due to the inhibition of PTPases. Since protein synthesis was blocked by the addition of cycloheximide, the increase of hexose transport shown in Fig. 5 should not be due to the increase of glucose transporters. Vanadate was also reported to prolong insulin action by increasing the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (34Fantus I.G. Ahmad F. Deragon G. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Vanadate activated PI 3-kinase-dependent glucose transport (35Donthi R.V. Huisamen B. Lochner A. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 2000; 14: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). But Et-3,4-dephostatin appears more effective than vanadate, as is shown in Fig. 5 B.Unexpectedly, Et-3,4-dephostatin alone mimicked insulin action to induce several phenotypic changes. Compared with the quick action of insulin in 30 min, Et-3,4-dephostatin alone increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 rather slowly in 6 h, as shown in Fig. 2. This is because accumulation of phosphorylation by inhibition of PTPases takes time. Et-3,4-dephostatin strongly induced GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport. Therefore, Et-3,4-dephostatin may inhibit not only insulin receptor dephosphorylation but also dephosphorylation of other components that regulate glucose uptake. In fact, Et-3,4-dephostatin induced tyrosine phosphorylation in several other proteins, including c-Cbl, PLCγ, PI 3-kinase, and IRS-3. In Fig. 2, Et-3,4-dephostatin unexpectedly lowered the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor and IRS-1 in a 30-min incubation. Insulin is known to activate PTPases such as PTP-1B (36Kenner K.A. Hill D.E. Olefsky J.M. Kusari J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25455-25462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that can dephosphorylate both insulin and IRS-1. Et-3,4-dephostatin might enhance induction of the inhibitor-insensitive PTPases by insulin in a 30-min incubation. On the other hand, Et-3,4-dephostatin did not affect insulin-induced activation of hexose transport even in a 30-min incubation (Fig.5 A). This is because Et-3,4-dephostatin might also inhibit tyrosine dephosphorylation of downstream components.Insulin-induced glucose transport is mediated largely by PI 3-kinase (37Asano T. Kanda A. Katagiri H. Nawano M. Ogihara T. Inukai K. Anai M. Fukushima Y. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Hooshmand-Rad R. Heldin C.H. Oka Y. Funaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17671-17676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and partly by p38 (38Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and protein synthesis are not necessary in the effect of insulin. In Fig. 6 A, insulin-induced glucose uptake was inhibited by LY294002 and SB203580 but not by a MEK inhibitor or by cycloheximide. Interestingly, LY294002 inhibited insulin-induced glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation completely in our assay system; but when Et-3,4-dephostatin was used, the inhibitor only partially suppressed glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation in a 6-h incubation (Fig. 6 A and 7). On the other hand, in a 30-min incubation, LY294002 completely blocked the increase of glucose transport by Et-3,4-dephostatin, as shown in Fig.6 B. Therefore, it is likely that Et-3,4-dephostatin activates a PI 3-kinase-independent pathway in addition to the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway only in long term incubation. Very recently, Pessin and co-workers (21Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bicket P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) showed the existence of a PI 3-kinase-independent c-Cbl pathway in insulin-induced signal transduction. The proto-oncogene product c-Cbl is known to be a component of protein-tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling cascades downstream of the activated cell surface receptors. These receptors include the T cell, B cell, and cytokine receptors (39Lupher Jr., M.L. Andoniou C.E. Bonita D. Miyake S. Band H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The c-Cbl protein contains the RING finger domain, an extensive proline-rich region that provides binding sites for the SH3 domain, and the C-terminal leucine zipper domain that shows significant homology to ubiquitin-associated proteins (40Liu Y.C. Altman A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In hematopoietic cells, c-Cbl is known to be a negative regulator of Syk tyrosine kinase through the RING finger domain (41Ota Y. Samelson L.E. Science. 1997; 276: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 cells, c-Cbl is prominently tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and not in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (42Rivon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Cbl protein associates with Cbl-associated protein at the site of caveola, and this protein complex up-regulates GLUT4 translocation through the PI 3-kinase independent pathway (21Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bicket P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Et-3,4-dephostatin inhibits PTPases to protect phosphorylated c-Cbl from dephosphorylation. Actually, Et-3,4-dephostatin markedly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl, as shown in Fig. 8. Insulin-induced c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation greatly decreased at 6 h, but when Et-3,4-dephostatin was added, the phosphorylation strongly remained. Et-3,4-dephostatin alone also induced phosphorylation of c-Cbl. Thus, it is likely that Et-3,4-dephostatin potentiates both PI 3-kinase/Akt-dependent and PI 3-kinase/Akt- independent pathways including activation of c-Cbl.Kayali et al. (25Kayali A.G. Eichhorn J. Haruta T. Morris A.J. Nelson J.G. Vollenweider P. Olefsky J.M. Webster N.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13808-13818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) reported that phospholipase C-γ is associated with the insulin receptor and can be phosphorylated by the receptor. Therefore, if a PI 3-kinase is not involved downstream of phospholipase C-γ, activation of phospholipase C-γ by inhibition of dephosphorylation may also be a possible mechanism.When Et-3,4-dephostatin was orally given to mice with high blood glucose, it lowered their blood glucose significantly, as shown in Fig.9. Therefore, Et-3,4-dephostatin is likely to be absorbed from the intestine and to be stable in the body. During the in vivoexperiment, no toxicity, including the loss of body weight, was observed. In 24 h, there was no marked difference in food uptake between the test and control group. There was also no abnormality in coat of fur, behavior, and feces. The methoxime-type derivative of dephostatin (29Watanabe T. Suzuki T. Umezawa Y. Takeuchi T. Otsuka M. Umezawa K. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 741-752Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) belongs to the PTPase inhibitors of the second generation. Long term experiments with this compound also decreased the blood glucose level in mice without toxicity. 2I. Takei and K. Umezawa, unpublished results. Thiazolidine compounds are being widely used clinically for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Its target is known to be peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, which is a unique transcription factor for adipocyte differentiation. In our assay system shown under “Experimental Procedures,” troglitazone significantly enhanced differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes. However, Et-3,4-dephostatin did not increase the differentiation significantly (data not shown). Therefore, the mechanism of the antidiabetic effect by Et-3,4-dephostatin in vivo should be different from that by troglitazone, and its side effects may not include obesity, unlike the case for troglitazone.Thus, Et-3,4-dephostatin potentiated the insulin-related signal transduction in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes and showed antidiabetic effects in mice. Especially, it was orally active in vivo. Since the nitrosamine group in Et-3,4-dephostatin may be mutagenic and carcinogenic, a nitrosamine-free analogue of Et-3,4-dephostatin (29Watanabe T. Suzuki T. Umezawa Y. Takeuchi T. Otsuka M. Umezawa K. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 741-752Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) may be a prototype of new antidiabetic agents. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is mainly characterized by impaired signal transduction downstream of the insulin receptor in peripheral tissues, such as skeletal muscles and adipocytes (1DeFronzo R.A.

Olson L.K. Zhang H.J. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1085-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Moran A. Zhang H.J. Olson L.K. Harmon J.S. Poitout V. Robertson R.P. J. Clin.

Zaitsev S.V. Zhivotovsky B. Köhler M. Efendic S. Orrenius S. Berggren P.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33501-33507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar)). A functional insulin receptor was also shown to be essential for the secretion of insulin by cultured mouse β-cells (8Kulkarni R.N. Brüning J.C. Winnay J.N. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Thiazolidine derivatives such as troglitazone are being or have been widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (9Mimura K. Umeda F. Hiramatsu S. Taniguchi S. Ono Y. Nakashima N.

Troglitazone is a ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ that transcriptionally regulates a number of adipose tissue-specific genes by binding to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response elements of these genes as a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor. These heterodimers potentiate adipose tissue differentiation in vivo (10Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 907-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and their side effects include obesity. Several drugs such as sulfonylureas enhance insulin secretion. Sulfonylureas bind to receptors on pancreatic β-cells to induce Ca2+ influx, thereby increasing insulin secretion (11Fujitani S. Ikenoue T. Akiyoshi M. Maki T. Yada T. Metabolism. 1996; 45: 184-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Compared with the insulin therapy for type I diabetes mellitus, chemotherapy for type 2 has been poorly developed, and less toxic chemotherapy based on the insulin receptor-associated signal transduction should be developed. The insulin receptor is a heterotetramer consisting of two α-subunits that are entirely extracellular and two β-subunits that span the plasma membrane and contain intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (12Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of insulin to its receptor results in activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase and receptor autophosphorylation, followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, -2, and -3, which then bind to the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI)1 3-kinase. Then the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase produces phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,3-trisphosphate, which can bind to the PH domain of PKBα(β)/Akt1(2), which then up-regulate glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation. These Akts are phosphorylated to become activated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 or 2 (14Franke T. Kaplan D. Cantley L. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). The insulin-stimulated phosphorylations of Akt on threonine 308 by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 and on serine 473 by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 2 are required for maximal Akt activity (15Alessi D.R.

Molecular characterization of this novel phenotype reveals a point mutation in the coding region of the sucrase-isomaltase (SI) gene that results in an amino acid substitution of a glutamine by arginine at residue 117 of the isomaltase subunit. This substitution is located in a domain revealing features of a trefoil motif or a P-domain in immediate vicinity of the heavily O-glycosylated stalk domain.

This requires the recognition and sorting of different classes of proteins not only during biosynthesis, but also during distributive events to the diverse cellular compartments (1Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Oftentimes altered and defective intracellular trafficking of proteins due to single point or deletion mutations in the coding region of the gene result in pathological disorders (2Wilson P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F434-F442PubMed Google Scholar, 3Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E.

Investigating the molecular basis of naturally occurring mutant protein phenotypes in diseases constitutes therefore a powerful means to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying intracellular protein transport and sorting. A small intestinal disorder directly associated with a folding mutant and defective intracellular protein transport is congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID).1 CSID is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by an absent sucrase activity within the sucrase-isomaltase (SI) enzyme complex, while the isomaltase activity can vary from absent to normal. The disease is clinically manifested as an osmotic-fermentative diarrhea upon ingestion of di- and oligosaccharides (4Treem W.R. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1995; 21: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Several phenotypes of the disease have been characterized on the basis of cellular mislocalization or aberrant function of the SI mutant protein. SI is a type II membrane-bound glycoprotein of the intestinal brush border comprising two strongly homologous subunits, sucrase and isomaltase (5Fransen J.A. Hauri H.P. Ginsel L.A. Naim H.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6Hauri H.P. Roth J. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lentze M. Milla P. Schmitz J. Hauri H.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 667-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These two domains originate from a large polypeptide precursor, pro-SI, by tryptic cleavage occurring in the intestinal lumen and ultimately maintain a strong association through noncovalent ionic interactions (9Hauri H.P. Quaroni A. Isselbacher K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5183-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme complex is a heavily N- and O-glycosylated protein (10Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ParticularlyO-glycosylation is critical for targeting of SI to the apical membrane through direct association in detergent-insoluble lipid rafts (11Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).In this paper we describe a novel phenotype of CSID and the corresponding mutation, which results in a random distribution of the SI protein at the apical and basolateral membrane. Here a point mutation, an adenine to glutamine at nucleotide 412 in the coding region of the isomaltase subunit, results in a substitution of glutamine to arginine at amino acid residue 117. Defects in polarized protein sorting implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases have been rarely observed, perhaps because such defects have lethal consequences during early stages of development. Abnormalities in protein trafficking in polycsytic kidney disease and cystic fibrosis have been shown to be associated with mutations in the coding regions of the corresponding genes (3Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar, 12Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A.

The mutation identified in this report, however, is to our knowledge the first of its kind, in which aberrant polarized sorting of an intestinal protein is disease-associated. By establishing the functional details of this mutation and its implication in the polarized sorting of SI, the structure and function of the sorting elements possibly interacting within the region harboring the mutation could be elucidated.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONClinical assessment of the sucrose malabsorption was achieved by the hydrogen breath test and confirmed by measuring the enzymatic activities of sucrase and isomaltase in intestinal biopsy samples. Both enzymes revealed drastic reduction in their activities with that of sucrase being 2 IU/mg and of isomaltase 5 IU/mg of protein. In comparison, the normal activity of sucrase and that of isomaltase in the small intestine range from 40 to 60 IU/mg of protein. Another disaccharidase in the small intestine, lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, revealed 42 IU/mg of protein, which is in the normal range, indicating that the sucrose malabsorption is restricted to the sucrase-isomaltase complex. The next step was therefore to analyze the molecular basis and the corresponding mechanisms leading to this defect. Due to the limited amount of the biopsy specimen, we were not able to investigate the biosynthesis and processing of the SI complex in organ culture as has been performed with other cases of CSID (8Naim H.Y. Roth J. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M. Milla P. Schmitz J. Hauri H.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 667-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Jacob R. Zimmer K.P. Schmitz J. Naim H.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the tissue available was adequate for the isolation of the cDNA encoding the patient's SI by reverse transcriptase-PCR following a similar strategy to that described previously (22Jacob R. Zimmer K.P. Schmitz J. Naim H.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Ouwendijk J. Peters W.J.M. te Morsche R.H.M. van de Vorstenbosch R.A. Ginsel L.A. Naim H.Y. Fransen J.A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1406: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The correctness of the cDNA was corroborated by sequencing in both directions 5′-3′ and vice versa (24Chantret I. Lacasa M. Chevalier G. Ruf J. Islam I. Mantei N. Edwards Y. Swallow D. Rousset M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A single point mutation could be identified in the patient's cDNA replacing an adenine by a guanine at nucleotide 412 (Fig. 1). This mutation results in an amino acid substitution of glutamine to arginine at residue 117 of the isomaltase subunit. Limited algorithmic analysis of this region revealed a trefoil motif or a P-domain also found in maltase-glucoamylase (25Nichols B.L. Eldering J. Avery S. Hahn D. Quaroni A. Sterchi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3076-3081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), a brush border protein with striking homologies to sucrase-isomaltase. These domains have been shown to be implicated in protein-protein interaction or lectin-like interactions, in the pathology of mucous epithelia and in modulating cell growth (for a review, see Ref. 26Hoffmann W. Hauser F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 239-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To analyze the detailed function and the significance of this mutation in this CSID phenotype, we expressed the mutant SI cDNA in the epithelial cell line MDCK cells, which do not express endogenous SI. This cell line is particularly convenient for these analyses borne out by its successful application in the heterologous expression of several intestinal proteins, including SI, which revealed structural and functional features as well polarized sorting behavior similar to their endogenously expressed wild type counterparts in intestinal epithelial cells (16Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis and processing of wild type and mutant SI in MDCK are shown in Fig.2. Continuous metabolic labeling of the cells containing the wild type SI protein for 6 h revealed a 210-kDa mannose-rich polypeptide (SIh) that shifted upon reaction with endo H to a smaller size and an endo H-resistant 245-kDa complex glycosylated mature protein (SIc) (Fig.2 A, denoted WT). A similar band pattern was also observed with the cells containing the mutant protein (Fig.2 A, denoted mutant). However, the proportion of the complex glycosylated protein in the total synthesized and processed SI protein was significantly less than that in its wild type counterpart, suggesting a slower rate of processing of the mannose-rich to the complex form. We therefore determined the transport and processing kinetics of both wild type and mutant SI employing a pulse-chase protocol. At early chase time points wild type SI appears as a 210-kDa mannose-rich SIh polypeptide that is gradually converted with increasing chase periods to the complex glycosylated SIc species (Fig. 2 B, denoted WT). Qualitatively a similar biosynthetic pattern could be observed for the mutant SI protein exemplified by the mannose-rich and complex glycosylated polypeptides (Fig. 2 B, denotedmutant). However, the t1/2 time for the conversion of the mannose-rich mutant SI into a complex glycosylated form was 4.5 h as compared with ∼1.5 h of the wild type protein (Fig. 2 C) compatible with delayed transport kinetics of this mutant from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Clearly the effects on the intracellular transport of the mutant SI are due to the Q117R substitution, which has most likely altered some of the structural features of SI, perhaps in the domain containing the mutation itself, and may result in an increased degradation of mutant SI. This could explain the substantial reduction in the activity of isomaltase and sucrase in the biopsy specimen as well as in transfected MDCK cells. The Q117R substitution itself does not generate a novel sequon for N-linked glycosylation (27Welply J.K. Shenbagamurthi P. Lennarz W.J. Naider F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11856-11863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and at the same time does not conform with a putative O-glycosylation motif (28Wilson I.B. Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that potential alterations in mutant SI are not due to differences in the N-glycosylation pattern, which is often implicated in the folding pattern of membrane glycoproteins already during early stages of posttranslational processing in the ER (29Roberts P.C. Garten W. Klenk H.D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3048-3060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Jacob R. Weiner J.R. Stadge S. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10630-10637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The pattern of O-glycosylation is similar in both cases, since treatments of cells with benzyl-GalNAc, an inhibitor ofO-glycosylation (11Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 18Kojima N. Handa K. Newman W. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), revealed reductions in the size of the wild type and the mutant SI forms reminiscent of comparable contents of O-glycans in both protein forms (Fig.2 D).Figure 2Expression of mutant SI cDNA in MDCK cells.

The samples were finally analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 6% slab gels and autoradiography. SIh is the mannose-rich endo H-sensitive form, and SIc is the complex glycosylated endo H-resistant form.

Detergent extracts of the cells were immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-SI and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 6% slab gels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The next step was to determine whether complex glycosylated mutant SI is correctly targeted to the apical membrane or whether the mutation is associated with the generation of a randomly or missorted SI phenotype. For this MDCK cells expressing the mutant and wild type proteins were grown on membrane filters, and their biosynthesis and polarized transport were followed by isolating the cell surface antigens from the apical or basolateral compartments with a mAb anti-SI. Fig.3 shows that the wild type SI protein was predominantly found at the apical membrane with almost 90% sorting fidelity, confirming previous data (16Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). By contrast, the mutant protein followed a random pattern of transport to the cell surface, since it appeared almost equally at both sides of the membrane. The results demonstrate therefore that the mutation Q117R is responsible for the generation of a mistargeted SI phenotype. This finding was at first glance surprising, since mutant SI similar to the wild type protein is O-glycosylated, and apical sorting of SI is known to take place through O-linked carbohydrates as a sorting signal and association of the protein with Triton X-100-insoluble cholesterol- and sphingolipids-rich membrane microdomains (11Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The sorting mechanism of mutant SI was therefore examined and compared with that of the wild type protein. As shown in Fig.4 a proportion of wild type SI was recovered in the Triton X-100-insoluble pellet, while the mutant SI protein was exclusively recovered in the detergent-soluble phase. Mutant SI therefore does not associate with lipid microdomains despite the presence of O-glycans that are required for this association and for apical sorting. The fact that the mutation is not directly implicated in O-glycosylation strongly suggests that a protein structure implicated in the sorting process has been altered. A Ser/Thr-rich stalk region immediately upstream of the transmembrane domain of SI is heavily O-glycosylated and is required for the association of SI with lipid rafts (16Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Deletion of this domain eliminates almost completely O-glycosylation of SI, thus affecting its detergent extractability concomitant with loss of its sorting fidelity, while the transport competence of SI per se remains unchanged. As shown here, the mutation Q117R induces similar effects with respect to detergent solubility and sorting of SI as the deletion mutants do. Unlike the deletion mutants, however, mutant SI is extensively O-glycosylated, but it is possible that these chains are not adequately recognized by a putative sorting element, a lectin-like protein for example. A recognition and subsequent binding would trigger the sequence of events leading to association of SI with lipid microdomains and its delivery to the apical membrane. The Q117R mutation is located in the P-domain in the immediate vicinity of the O-glycosylated stalk domain (24Chantret I. Lacasa M. Chevalier G. Ruf J. Islam I. Mantei N. Edwards Y. Swallow D. Rousset M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is likely that structural alterations in this domain have partially or completely masked the O-linked carbohydrates and thus hampered their recognition. Along this concept a correctly folded P-domain would be implicated in the sorting event by providing ample spatial requirements required for an adequate recognition of theO-glycosylated sorting signal by a specific sorting protein. The existence, identity, and structure of components of the apical sorting machinery, in particular that of a putative cellular lectin-like protein specific for binding residues comprisingO-linked chains, such as galactose orN-acetylgalactoseamine, are far from being unraveled. It has been proposed that lectin-like proteins in trans-Golgi network and post-Golgi compartments may recognize N-linked chains that function as apical sorting signals on some proteins and thus mediate their incorporation into apical carrier vesicles (31Rodriguez-Boulan E. Gonzalez A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). VIP 36 is one of these candidates that binds specifically galactose andN-acetylgalactoseamine residues (32Fiedler K. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 271-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can therefore function as a receptor for both N- and O-linked glycans. Its detection, however, in basolateral carriers has raised questions as to its specific role in apical sorting. Nevertheless, some apical proteins are targeted to the apical membrane by transcytosis through the basolateral membrane and would also be transiently found in basolateral vesicles (33Matlin K. Bainton D.F. Pesonen M. Louvard D. Genty N. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Figure 3Polarized expression of mutant SI in MDCK cells.

The fact that the available O-linked glycans in mutant SI are not recognized by such a putative receptor suggests that its conformation should properly fit in the context of three structures of the SI protein, the P-domain, theO-glycosylated stalk region, and the transmembrane domain, which has been assigned a decisive role in the sorting pathway of SI (16Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Strategies could therefore be designed to discover this putative protein by utilizing the SI protein and its mutant phenotype as promising models. The composition and function of the plasma membrane of polarized cells are maintained by a complex intracellular traffic moving cell surface glycoproteins between organelles. This requires the recognition and sorting of different classes of proteins not only during biosynthesis, but also during distributive events to the diverse cellular compartments (1Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Oftentimes altered and defective intracellular trafficking of proteins due to single point or deletion mutations in the coding region of the gene result in pathological disorders (2Wilson P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F434-F442PubMed Google Scholar, 3Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Investigating the molecular basis of naturally occurring mutant protein phenotypes in diseases constitutes therefore a powerful means to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying intracellular protein transport and sorting. A small intestinal disorder directly associated with a folding mutant and defective intracellular protein transport is congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID).1 CSID is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by an absent sucrase activity within the sucrase-isomaltase (SI) enzyme complex, while the isomaltase activity can vary from absent to normal. The disease is clinically manifested as an osmotic-fermentative diarrhea upon ingestion of di- and oligosaccharides (4Treem W.R. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1995; 21: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Several phenotypes of the disease have been characterized on the basis of cellular mislocalization or aberrant function of the SI mutant protein. SI is a type II membrane-bound glycoprotein of the intestinal brush border comprising two strongly homologous subunits, sucrase and isomaltase (5Fransen J.A. Hauri H.P. Ginsel L.A. Naim H.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6Hauri H.P. Roth J. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lentze M. Milla P. Schmitz J. Hauri H.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 667-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These two domains originate from a large polypeptide precursor, pro-SI, by tryptic cleavage occurring in the intestinal lumen and ultimately maintain a strong association through noncovalent ionic interactions (9Hauri H.P. Quaroni A. Isselbacher K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5183-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme complex is a heavily N- and O-glycosylated protein (10Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ParticularlyO-glycosylation is critical for targeting of SI to the apical membrane through direct association in detergent-insoluble lipid rafts (11Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this paper we describe a novel phenotype of CSID and the corresponding mutation, which results in a random distribution of the SI protein at the apical and basolateral membrane. Here a point mutation, an adenine to glutamine at nucleotide 412 in the coding region of the isomaltase subunit, results in a substitution of glutamine to arginine at amino acid residue 117. Defects in polarized protein sorting implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases have been rarely observed, perhaps because such defects have lethal consequences during early stages of development. Abnormalities in protein trafficking in polycsytic kidney disease and cystic fibrosis have been shown to be associated with mutations in the coding regions of the corresponding genes (3Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar, 12Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A.

The mutation identified in this report, however, is to our knowledge the first of its kind, in which aberrant polarized sorting of an intestinal protein is disease-associated. By establishing the functional details of this mutation and its implication in the polarized sorting of SI, the structure and function of the sorting elements possibly interacting within the region harboring the mutation could be elucidated. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONClinical assessment of the sucrose malabsorption was achieved by the hydrogen breath test and confirmed by measuring the enzymatic activities of sucrase and isomaltase in intestinal biopsy samples. Both enzymes revealed drastic reduction in their activities with that of sucrase being 2 IU/mg and of isomaltase 5 IU/mg of protein. In comparison, the normal activity of sucrase and that of isomaltase in the small intestine range from 40 to 60 IU/mg of protein.

FAO Plant Prot. Bull. 1994; 42: 3-32Google Scholar). These viruses have a single-stranded DNA genome that is replicated in nuclei of infected cells by a rolling circle mechanism (2Saunders K. Lucy A.

A. 1991; 88: 8029-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Of the different gene products encoded by the virus, only AC1, the replication-associated protein (Rep), is essential for viral DNA replication. The first step in the replication process involves recognition of specific DNA sequences referred to as iterons, (4Arguello-Astorga G.R. Guevara-Gonzalez R.G. Herrera-Estrella L.R. Rivera-Bustamante R.F. Virology. 1994; 203: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), by the Rep protein in the common region (CR)1 of the virus genome. Most iteron sequences occur as direct repeat motifs of 6–12 base pairs between the TATA box and the start site of transcription of theAC1 gene. The iterons serve as high affinity binding sites of the Rep protein and therefore function as the origin recognition sequences. Specific regions on the N terminus of Rep protein are involved in DNA binding and have been identified for Tomato golden mosaic virus(TGMV) (5Fontes E.P.B. Gladfelter H.J. Schaffer R.L. Petty I.T.D.

Beachy R.N. Fauquet C.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5481-5489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further analyses using gel shift assays confirmed that the Rep protein specifically binds to the iterated motifs GGTGTCTGGAGTC (nucleotides 2640–2653) in the origin of replication (11Chatterji A. Chatterji U. Beachy R.N. Fauquet C.M. Virology. 2000; 273: 314-350Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the present study, our objective was to identify the DNA binding domain of the Rep protein and to determine the nature and contribution of DNA binding and protein oligomerization properties of the Rep protein to limit viral DNA accumulation in plants. In two cases, truncated Rep proteins have been shown to confer resistance to other geminiviruses (7Hong Y. Stanley J. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2415-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Noris E. Accotto G.P. Tavazza R. Brunetti A. Crespi S. Tavazza M. Virology. 1996; 224: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and the resistance was specific and limited to the homologous virus. We based our choice of truncated Rep protein on the knowledge of overlapping sites for DNA cleavage, domains for DNA binding, and domains for protein oligomerization (13Orozco B.M. Miller A.B. Stellage S.B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9840-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 14Heyraud-Nitschke F. Schumacher S. Laufs J. Schaefer S. Schell J. Gronenborn B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that a truncated Rep protein that was competent for DNA binding and oligomerization domain might have a greater probability to interfere with the virus replication and might be effective against both homologous and heterologous viruses. In this study, we mapped the minimal binding domain on the Rep protein by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). We also tested the effect of truncated and full-length AC1 sequences on DNA replication of ToLCNDV and other geminiviruses in transient assays using BY2 protoplasts and Nicotiana benthamiana plants. These studies revealed that transient expression of the ToLCNDV-truncated Rep protein encoding the DNA binding and the oligomerization domains could significantly inhibit replication of ToLCNDV viral DNA and to some extent the replication of other geminiviruses having similar iteron sequences. The full-length AC1 genes from the severe and the mild strains of ToLCNDV were amplified by PCR from pMPA1 (DNA-A of the severe strain ToLCNDV) and pMPA2 (DNA-A of the mild strain ToLCNDV) (15Padidam M. Beachy R.N. Fauquet C.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), cloned in the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and overexpressed inEscherichia coli cells. The recombinant proteins were named according to the number of amino acids at the N or C terminus of the Rep protein. The C-terminal truncations were made by inserting an in-frame stop codon at positions 2436 (pAC1-(1–52)), 2250 (pAC1-(1–114)), and 2110 (pAC1-(1–160)). The truncated AC1sequences were subcloned as a BamHI–XhoI fragment in the pGEX-4T-3 vector, generating pAC1-(1–52), pAC1-(1–114), and pAC1-(1–160), respectively. At the N terminus, the first 21 amino acids of the protein were deleted, and anNheI site was inserted to create an in-frame start codon. The truncated fragment was cloned as a NheI–XhoI fragment in the vector pGEX-4T-3 to produce pAC1-(22–360).The plasmids pAC1-(52–360) and pAC1-(114–360) were produced similarly but had a deletion of the first 51 and 113 amino acids, respectively, from the N terminus of the AC1 gene. The truncated Rep proteins were expressed from plasmids mentioned above in E. colicells. The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged AC1 fusion proteins were purified by glutathione affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, the cells were grown to a density of 0.75–0.8A 600. The cultures were induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-D thiogalactoside at a final concentration of 1 mm and grown further for 2 h. The cells were finally harvested at 4000 rpm (Beckman, JS 10.5 rotor) for 10 min. The pellets were suspended in ice cold 1× PBS (10 mmKH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified at 17,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was loaded on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with 1× PBS. After repeated washing of the column with 1× PBS, the protein was eluted with glutathione elution buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The eluted fractions were dialyzed against 1× PBS to remove glutathione and concentrated using centricon filters (Amicon, Centricon). Protein concentrations were estimated using Bradford's reagent (Bio-Rad). Protein extracts from E. coli cells co-expressing the untagged, wild type AC1 and GST fusion of truncated Rep proteins were tested for AC1 oligomerization by co-purification on glutathione-Sepharose. Co-purification of proteins was monitored by resolving the eluted fractions on SDS-PAGE and by immunoblotting. The full-length and truncated Rep proteins were detected using the polyclonal anti-AC1 antibody. A similar procedure was used to assess the oligomerization of full-length Rep proteins from other geminiviruses with the truncated Rep protein of ToLCNDV (pAC1-(1–160)). Protein extracts from E. coli cells co-expressing wild type AC1 of Pepper huasteco yellow vein virus(PHYVV), Potato yellow mosaic virus(PYMV), and ACMV and the GST-tagged pAC1-(1–160) were incubated with GST-Sepharose beads, washed thoroughly with 1× PBS, and eluted with glutathione elution buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The eluate was resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and detected by immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-AC1 antibody and anti-GST antibody. For expression of the truncated AC1 gene in plant cells, the mutants described above were subcloned as BamHI fragments in the plant expression vector pILTAB 350. This placed the DNA fragment 3′ of the cassava vein mosaic virus promoter (16Verdaguer B. de Kochko A. Fux C. Beachy R.N. Fauquet C.M. Plant Mol.

Open table in a new tab The single-stranded 18-mer oligonucleotides containing the potential binding sites of the Rep protein of ToLCNDV were annealed to their complementary strands. The oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified on polyacrylamide gels. The final concentration of the probes was 500 pm (30,000 cpm). The concentration of competitor DNA used was 50 nm per reaction. Both the probe and the competitor DNAs were purified on Sephadex G-25 columns, quantified by scintillation counting, and diluted to 30,000 cpm for each binding reaction. The binding assays were performed using purified Rep protein. Typically, the binding reactions contained 500 ng of pure protein, 1 ng of labeled DNA, and 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC). Binding buffer contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 15% glycerol. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min, and the complexes were resolved on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× TBE buffer. The gels were dried on Whatman paper and exposed to x-ray film. Comparative efficiency of binding was analyzed by quantifying the amount of radioactivity in the retarded bands using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Protoplasts derived from Nicotiana tabacum BY-2 suspension cultures were used for transfection with viral DNA (20Watanabe Y. Meshi T. Okada Y. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 65-69Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Protoplasts were collected from cultures 48 h postinoculation for DNA isolation and analysis. One million protoplasts were inoculated by electroporation (250 V, 500 microfarads) with 2 μg each of A and B component DNAs and 40 μg of sheared herring sperm DNA (10Chatterji A. Padidam M. Beachy R.N. Fauquet C.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5481-5489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For co-inoculation experiments, 2 μg of the plasmid DNA containing the expression cassettes with truncated AC1 gene sequences were used. Total DNA from the protoplasts was extracted 48 h after transfection (21Dellaporta S.L. Wood J. Hicks J.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1983; 1: 19-21Crossref Scopus (6371) Google Scholar, 22Mettler I.J. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1987; 5: 346-349Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Viral DNA accumulation was analyzed by Southern blotting (10Chatterji A. Padidam M. Beachy R.N. Fauquet C.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5481-5489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total proteins were extracted from the protoplasts 48 h after transfection by sonication of the cell pellets in ice cold 1× PBS (10 mm KH2PO4, 100 mmNaCl). The lysate was clarified at 17,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatant was used for immunoprecipitations. Immunoprecipitations were done by incubating 50 μg of total protein extracts with polyclonal anti-AC1 antiserum (1 mg) overnight at 4 °C. Protein-antibody complexes were incubated with protein A-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed with 1× PBS. Bound proteins were eluted from the agarose beads in SDS-PAGE sample buffer by boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. Proteins resolved on the gel were transferred on nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti AC1 antibody using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride for colorimetric quantitation of the expressed Rep levels in the cell extracts. Two-week-old seedlings of N. benthamiana were grown in magenta boxes and inoculated with partial tandem dimers of viral DNA using a Bio-Rad helium-driven particle gun (10Chatterji A. Padidam M. Beachy R.N. Fauquet C.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5481-5489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ten plants were inoculated with each mutant using 0.5 μg each of DNA-A and DNA-B genomic components per plant. Plants were observed for symptom development, and newly emerging leaves were harvested for Southern blot analysis 4 weeks postinoculation. DNA extractions from systemically infected leaf samples were completed as described by Dellaportaet al. (21Dellaporta S.L. Wood J. Hicks J.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1983; 1: 19-21Crossref Scopus (6371) Google Scholar) and from protoplasts by following the procedure of Mettler (22Mettler I.J. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1987; 5: 346-349Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Total DNA (4 μg) was fractionated on 1% agarose gels without ethidium bromide and transferred to nylon membranes. Viral DNA was detected by using a 900-base pairAflII–PstI fragment of the A component containing sequences from the open reading frames of theAC1, AC2, and AC3 genes or a probe specific for the B component (878-base pair PCR-amplifiedBC1 gene). The amount of viral DNA was quantified as previously described (10Chatterji A. Padidam M. Beachy R.N. Fauquet C.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5481-5489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of geminiviruses other than ToLCNDV, fragments of their AC1 and BC1 genes were amplified and used as probes to analyze the replication levels of viral DNA. The Rep protein binds specifically to a directly repeated DNA sequence motif in the common region of the ToLCNDV genome (11Chatterji A. Chatterji U. Beachy R.N. Fauquet C.M. Virology. 2000; 273: 314-350Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Purified Rep proteins truncated at amino acids 160, 114, and 52 were used to map the C-terminal boundary of the Rep DNA binding domainin vitro. As a control, full-length Rep protein (amino acids 1–360) was used in all assays. The truncated and full-length Rep proteins were expressed in E. coli with a GST tag and affinity-purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. The affinity-purified proteins were highly enriched as determined by Coomassie staining following electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE gels. The proteins were detected in immunoblots using anti-GST antibody (data not shown). The purified Rep proteins were tested for their ability to bind a radiolabeled 18-mer (nucleotides 2632–2653) that contains the Rep binding site sequence, 5′-GGTGTCTGGAGTC-3′. DNA-protein complexes that contained Rep-(1–360) and Rep-(1–160) were detected. No binding was observed for Rep-(1–52) or Rep-(1–114) (Fig.1A, lanes 1–4). These results located the C-terminal boundary of the DNA binding domain of the Rep protein between amino acids 115 and 160. The N-terminal boundary of the DNA binding domain was determinedin vitro by comparing the binding of full-length Rep-(1–360) and Rep-(22–360), Rep-(52–360), and Rep-(114–360) to the 18-base pair iteron sequence, 5′-GGTGTCTGGAGTC-3′ in EMSAs. The DNA-protein complexes were observed in case of full-length Rep protein, while no DNA-protein complexes were detected for the Rep-(22–360), Rep-(52–360), or Rep-(114–360) (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–4). These results demonstrated that the sequences within the first 21 amino acids of the Rep protein are essential for protein-DNA interactions. Together, these results placed the DNA binding domain of ToLCNDV Rep protein between amino acids 1 and 160. To determine if truncations at the N and the C termini of Rep protein affect its ability to oligomerize, GST-tagged truncated Rep proteins were co-expressed with untagged wild type full-length Rep protein in bacterial cells and co-purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The bound fractions were eluted and analyzed in immunoblots using polyclonal anti-AC1 antiserum. The wild type Rep-(1–360) co-purified with GST-tagged truncated proteins Rep-(22–360), Rep-(52–360), and Rep-(114–360) (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–5), suggesting that truncations made at the N terminus in the Rep did not affect the ability of the Rep protein to oligomerize with itself, although each of the truncated proteins was deficient for DNA binding. The effect of Rep protein on viral DNA replication was investigated by co-inoculating N. tabacum BY2 protoplasts with DNA-A and various cassettes that express truncated AC1gene sequences from the CsVMV promoter. ToLCNDV DNA-A replicated in BY-2 cells and accumulated high levels of single-stranded (ss) and supercoiled (sc) DNA (Fig. 2A,lane 1). In contrast, there was a significant decrease in the level of viral DNA replication (78% drop) in the presence of Rep-(1–160) (Fig. 2A, lane 4, Table I). Reduction in replication was estimated by quantifying the amount of radioactivity using a PhosphorImager (Storm 860; Molecular Dynamics). The reduction in virus replication was not as dramatic in the presence of Rep-(1–52) (Fig. 2A, lane 2) or Rep-(1–114) (Fig. 2A, lane 3) when compared with Rep-(1–160) (Fig. 2A, lane 4). EMSAs showed that the Rep-(1–52) and Rep-(1–114) do not bind DNA (Fig.1A, lanes 2 and 3), implying that an intact DNA binding domain and/or a protein oligomerization domain is essential for inhibition of replication.Table IVirus replication in BY2 protoplasts and N. benthamiana plants co-inoculated with truncated Rep protein gene constructs and the viral DNA of the severe strain of ToLCNDVVirus constructSymptom expression1-aA total of 10 plants were inoculated per experiment, and each experiment was repeated three times.

The viral DNA was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Open table in a new tab To determine the relative expression levels of the three truncated Rep proteins in transfected tobacco protoplasts, total proteins were extracted from the tobacco protoplasts 48 h after infection and immunoprecipitated with the anti-AC1 antibody, and the protein-antibody complexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels. All of the three truncated proteins could be detected in immunoblots from the transfected protoplasts when developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride produces a brown precipitate with the peroxidase and thereby provided a direct measure of the amount of antibody bound to the expressed protein in the samples, revealing that all three truncated Rep proteins were expressed stably and in equivalent amounts in the protoplasts (Fig.2B, lanes 2–6). Two-week-old seedlings ofN. benthamiana plants were co-bombarded with 2 μg each of infectious dimers of ToLCNDV DNA-A and DNA-B in the presence or absence of genes encoding Rep-(1–160). The plants were observed daily for symptom development. All of the plants inoculated only with the wild type virus DNAs developed severe symptoms 5 days after inoculation. In contrast, plants co-inoculated with the virus and the genes encoding Rep-(1–160) developed milder symptoms of ToLCNDV infection (Table I). About 55% of the plants were asymptomatic, 30% showed mild chlorosis, and 15% expressed mild leaf curl symptoms (Table I). None of the plants showed severe infection or stunted growth as in plants infected only with ToLCNDV. Most of the plants co-inoculated with Rep-(1–52) and Rep-(1–114) developed severe symptoms by 7 days postinoculation (Tables I and II). The levels of viral DNA in ToLCNDV-infected plants were analyzed by Southern blot analysis of young leaves sampled 28 days postinoculation using probes that detected DNA-A and DNA-B (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 3, A andB, respectively). The amount of viral DNA ranged from undetectable to very low (an average of 15% of the wild type levels) in asymptomatic plants, and the accumulation of both genomic components increased with increasing severity of symptom expression. Plants co-inoculated with expression cassettes Rep-(1–52) and Rep-(1–114) developed intermediate to severe symptoms in most of the plants and accumulated viral DNA between 85 and 92% of wild type infection. To investigate the potential of truncated Rep protein to inhibit the replication of other geminiviruses, we selected examples of viruses that belonged to the Old World (ACMV) and New World geminiviruses (PHYVV and PYMV-TT). We reasoned that for the Rep to be able to interfere in replication of heterologous geminiviruses, it must (a) bind to the origin sequences of these viruses and (b) oligomerize with their Rep proteins. For the EMSA studies, fragments of the intergenic region sequences of the selected heterologous geminiviruses close to the TATA box were chosen. The coordinates of these sequences are given in TableIII. To determine if the putative iteron sequences of the other geminiviruses could compete with the cognate iteron sequences of ToLCNDV for binding to ToLCNDV Rep protein, synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the CR sequences from each virus were synthesized and used as competitors in EMSAs. None of the CR sequences were effective competitors in EMSA with the ToLCNDV Rep protein (Fig. 4A,lanes 3–6) and did not affect binding of the Rep protein with its cognate 13-mer iteron sequences to a significant degree. The crude lysates of E. coli cells co-expressing wild type Rep proteins from ACMV, PHYVV, or PYMV and the GST-tagged ToLCNDV Rep-(1–160) were tested for the ability to bind to each other. Crude protein extracts from bacterial cells co-expressing the target proteins were loaded on a GST-Sepharose column, washed extensively with 1× PBS, and eluted with glutathione elution buffer. The resulting fractions were detected in immunoblots using polyclonal anti-AC1 and anti-GST antibodies. In immunoblots, the anti-AC1 antibody detected wild type untagged Rep proteins from ACMV, PHYVV, and PYMV-TT that co-purified with the ToLCNDV Rep-(1–160) (Fig. 4B, lanes 2–6). When the same blot was washed and reprobed with anti-GST antibody, only the truncated Rep protein of ToLCNDV (Rep-(1–160)) in each of the samples was detected (Fig. 4C,lanes 2–6). To determine if Rep-(1–160) could reduce accumulation of other geminiviruses, in vivo replication assays were conducted by co-bombarding the N. benthamiana plants with partial/tandem dimers of full-length A and B components of ACMV, PHYVV, and PYMV-TT with genes encoding Rep-(1–160) of ToLCNDV. Most plants developed typical symptoms of virus infection within 21–27 days postinoculation as opposed to 7–10 days required for the symptoms on control plants to develop infection. Southern blot analysis of viral DNA extracted from the plants harvested 28 days postinoculation showed a minor reduction in the levels of virus accumulation as compared with the control plants (TableIV and Fig.5, A and B). However, the decrease in replication was not as significant as the inhibition observed in the case of ToLCNDV DNA.Table IVRegulation of virus DNA replication in BY2 protoplasts by the N-terminal sequences of AC1 gene of ToLCNDVVirusPutative iteron4-aThe sequences indicate putative iteron sequences.N-Rep sequenceEMSAReplication4-bOnly Rep-(1–160) was tested in competition experiments.

Open table in a new tab We determined the nature and the significance of the DNA binding and protein oligomerization functions of a truncated Rep-(1–160) protein to interfere in DNA accumulation of homologous and heterologous geminiviruses. Our studies show that while both activities of Rep-(1–160) contribute to interference in DNA accumulation, protein oligomerization, unlike DNA binding, is nonspecific and can occur between the Rep proteins of two unrelated geminiviruses. We mapped the DNA binding domain on the Rep protein of ToLCNDV to amino acids 1–160 and showed that the transient expression of this Rep sequence significantly inhibits ToLCNDV DNA accumulation in inoculated tobacco protoplasts and plants. Of the three C-terminal truncations made in the AC1 gene, only Rep-(1–160) bound the iteron DNA sequences in vitro, and the two truncations Rep-(1–52) and Rep-(1–114) were not competent to bind viral DNAin vitro. None of the N-terminal truncations tested (i.e. Rep-(22–360), Rep-(52–360), or Rep-(114–360)) bound viral DNA, indicating that an intact N terminus is required for the Rep protein to bind the origin sequences. In co-purification assays, each of the three N-terminal truncated proteins bound with the wild type Rep protein as detected by immunoblotting of the bound fractions. The co-immunoprecipitation assays indirectly suggested that the oligomerization domain might overlap the DNA binding domain. In TGMV, it is known that the oligomerization domain overlaps the DNA binding domain (13Orozco B.M. Miller A.B. Stellage S.B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9840-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In co-infection studies, the sequences comprising the Rep-(1–52) or Rep-(1–114) amino acids of the Rep protein did not cause a significant reduction in ToLCNDV accumulation. However, Rep-(1–160) bound with high affinity to the iteron sequences and reduced viral replication in protoplasts and plants. Colorimetric quantification of the truncated proteins revealed that all three proteins were expressed in equivalent amounts, ruling out the possibility that poor expression and/or instability of Rep-(1–52) and Rep-(1–114) in tobacco protoplasts may have compromised their ability to inhibit virus replication. In related studies, we observed that N. benthamiana plants co-bombarded with plasmids that produced Rep-(1–160) and infectious ToLCNDV produced a range of symptoms from asymptomatic to a mild leaf curl. None of the plants developed the severe puckering and blistering associated with wild type virus infection. Southern blot analysis of the infected plants showed that accumulation of viral DNA in plants with mild or no symptoms was much less than in plants showing severe symptoms. More importantly, the degree of inhibition in plants was similar to those observed in BY-2 protoplasts, indicating that the impact is probably on virus replication. Rep-(1–160) contains the DNA binding domain of the ToLCNDV-Rep. By analogy with the Rep proteins of TGMV and Tomato yellow leaf curl virus, this fragment is expected to contain the domains for DNA cleavage and ligation, as well as protein oligomerization domain (13Orozco B.M. Miller A.B. Stellage S.B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9840-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,23Laufs J. Traut W. Heyraud F. Matzeit V. Rogers S.G. Schell J. Gronenborn B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3879-3883Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This region of the Rep protein of ToLCNDV is involved in the specificity of origin recognition and binding (10Chatterji A. Padidam M. Beachy R.N. Fauquet C.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5481-5489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the various activities that are associated with Rep-(1–160), it is possible to suggest the mode of action of Rep-(1–160) in limiting virus DNA accumulation. One possibility is that the Rep-(1–160) protein reduces replication by competing with the viral Rep protein for binding the iteron sequences in the origin. The truncated Rep protein may therefore behave as a dominant negative mutant (24Herskowitz I. Nature. 1987; 329: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) and block virus replication. Another possibility is that the truncated Rep protein does not contain the NTP binding domain present on the C terminus of the Rep protein. The NTP binding domain is required for replication (25Desbeiz C. David C. Mettouchi A. Laufs J. Gronenborn B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5640-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and the lack of this region may interfere with the normal replication process of the virus. The fact that the Rep protein represses its own transcription may be yet another explanation for the inhibition of virus replication. Presumably, binding by the Rep protein to the origin is responsible for the repression of AC1 gene transcription in TGMV (26Sunter G. Hartitz M.D. Bisaro D.M. Virology. 1993; 195: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Eagle P.A. Orozco B.M. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1157-1170PubMed Google Scholar) and ACMV (7Hong Y. Stanley J. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2415-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of the truncated viral Rep protein could repress the transcription of the wild type AC1gene by binding to the origin, thereby influencing viral accumulation levels. Alternately, as suggested in the case of wheat dwarf virus, constitutively expressed Rep may adversely affect the integrity of the viral DNA by introducing nicks at cryptic motifs (28Heyraud F. Matzeit V. Kammann M. Schaefer S. Schell J. Gronenborn B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4445-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Comparison of co-infection experiments performed using truncated Rep proteins of the mild and the severe strains of ToLCNDV in protoplasts and plants suggested that only homologous Rep sequences could reduce virus accumulation with high efficiency. The Rep-(1–160) from the severe strain did not significantly restrict the virus replication of the mild strain and vice versa. Our previous work showed that the mild and the severe strains of ToLCNDV exhibit selectivity in binding to their cognate iteron sequences (11Chatterji A. Chatterji U. Beachy R.N. Fauquet C.M. Virology. 2000; 273: 314-350Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Hence, the inability of Rep-(1–160) of one strain to limit virus DNA accumulation of the heterologous strain may reflect specificity of interaction by the Rep protein for its cognate origin DNA sequences. Since the Rep-(1–160) can bind to DNA and form oligomers, these results support the hypothesis that DNA binding and protein oligomerization are important in inhibition of virus replication by Rep-(1–160). Notwithstanding that Rep-(1–160) of the severe strain of ToLCNDV had a modest effect on the replication of the mild strain, we were interested to know if Rep-(1–160) can interfere with the replication of related geminiviruses that have similar sequences in their origins of replication. The reduction in virus accumulation in the case of unrelated geminiviruses was rather surprising, considering that none of the CR sequences from these viruses were effective competitors for Rep-(1–160) in EMSAs. However, the results were not unexpected because the co-purification experiments revealed the ability of Rep-(1–160) to interact with the Rep proteins of heterologous geminiviruses. These data suggest that since the Rep-(1–160) protein does not bind to the heterologous CR sequences, reduction in virus accumulation may result from oligomerization of Rep-(1–160) with the Rep proteins of the unrelated geminiviruses. This level of virus reduction was similar to the reduction of mild strain ToLCNDV accumulation by the Rep-(1–160). We suggest that oligomers of Rep-(1–160) could potentially interfere with the replication complexes formed during infection by PHYVV, PYMV, ACMV, or the mild strain of ToLCNDV. Formation of heteromultimers via protein-protein interactions (29Settlage S.B. Miller B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6790-6795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been reported between TGMV and BGMV. The formation of heteromultimeric complexes might sequester the wild type Rep oligomers that otherwise would participate in the formation of a replication complex or might prevent recognition of origin sequences. Several approaches to control replication of geminiviruses have been developed. Transgenic N. benthamiana plants that accumulate defective interfering DNA (30Stanley J. Frischmuth T. Ellwood S. Proc.

Our studies demonstrate the potential of using Rep proteins that are mutated in the oligomerization and DNA binding domain to interfere with viral DNA replication. Experiments are in progress to test the stable expression and efficiency of Rep-(1–160) in transgenic tobacco and tomato plants for resistance to ToLCNDV."

https://openalex.org/W1976634561,"Analysis of prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) across all three taxonomic domains (Eubacteria, Eucarya, and Archaea) reveals that the sequences are divided into two distinct groups. Recent studies show that Escherichia coli ProRS, a member of the “prokaryotic-like” group, recognizes specific tRNA bases at both the acceptor and anticodon ends, whereas human ProRS, a member of the “eukaryotic-like” group, recognizes nucleotide bases primarily in the anticodon. The archaeal Methanococcus jannaschii ProRS is a member of the eukaryotic-like group, although its tRNAPro possesses prokaryotic features in the acceptor stem. We show here that, in some respects, recognition of tRNAPro by M. jannaschii ProRS parallels that of human, with a strong emphasis on the anticodon and only weak recognition of the acceptor stem. However, our data also indicate differences in the details of the anticodon recognition between these two eukaryotic-like synthetases. Although the human enzyme places a stronger emphasis on G35, the M. jannaschii enzyme places a stronger emphasis on G36, a feature that is shared by E. coli ProRS. These results, interpreted in the context of an extensive sequence alignment, provide evidence of divergent adaptation by M. jannaschii ProRS; recognition of the tRNA acceptor end is eukaryotic-like, whereas the details of the anticodon recognition are prokaryotic-like. This divergence may be a reflection of the unusual dual function of this enzyme, which catalyzes specific aminoacylation with proline as well as with cysteine.

This divergence may be a reflection of the unusual dual function of this enzyme, which catalyzes specific aminoacylation with proline as well as with cysteine. prolyl-tRNA synthetase Recognition of tRNA by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases provides the basis for decoding genetic information. Through this recognition, each of the 20 families of tRNA is specifically charged with an amino acid by the cognate synthetase, so that the amino acid/anticodon trinucleotide relationship can be used to translate nucleic acid sequences into proteins. Although each tRNA molecule consists of ∼76 nucleotides, only a few are important for specific aminoacylation, and these are generally located in the acceptor end and in the anticodon (1Giegé R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). In some cases, the position and identity of a strong recognition element has been maintained through evolution (2Hou Y.M. Schimmel P.

Stehlin C. Chan B. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15540-15547Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For the latter cases, tRNA-synthetase co-adaptation is necessary to preserve the specificity of recognition and the fidelity of the decoding system through evolution. In the case of tRNAPro recognition by prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS),1 the determinants for the eubacterial Escherichia coli enzyme are located at both the acceptor end and in the anticodon sequence (6Liu H. Peterson R. Kessler J. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, those for the human enzyme are located only in the anticodon (13Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This shift of determinants reflects a change in enzyme sequence and structure from E. coli to human. Indeed, based on the crystal structure of ProRS of Thermus thermophilus and an extensive sequence alignment of ProRS enzymes from all three taxonomic domains, the E. coli and human synthetases are clearly members of two distinct groups of ProRS (Fig. 1) (13Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Krikliviy I. Tukalo M.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4745-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although both the “prokaryotic-like” and “eukaryotic-like” groups contain three conserved motifs that are characteristic of the class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, specific amino acid sequences that constitute these motifs differ between the two groups. This difference is particularly striking in the variable loop connecting the β-strands of motif 2 (12Burke B. Yang F. Chen F. Stehlin C. Chan B. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15540-15547Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Specific amino acid residues within the motif 2 loop are known to make critical acceptor stem contacts in many class II synthetases including E. coli ProRS (12Burke B. Yang F. Chen F. Stehlin C. Chan B. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15540-15547Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16Ruff M. Krishnaswamy S. Boeglin M. Poterszman A. Mitschler A. Podjarny A. Rees B.

Moulinier L. Thierry J.C. Moras D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6532-6541Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The prokaryotic-like group of ProRS enzymes differs from the eukaryotic-like group by another major feature. Whereas the prokaryotic enzymes contain an insertion sequence between motif 2 and motif 3, the eukaryotic group lacks this insertion and instead contains a longer C-terminal extension (Fig. 1) (13Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To complement previous studies of E. coli and human ProRS and to determine the relatedness of tRNA recognition by ProRS from all three domains of life, we investigated here ProRS of the archaeonMethanococcus jannaschii. Although this ProRS belongs to the eukaryotic group, its tRNA shares some acceptor stem features withE. coli tRNAPro. In particular, M. jannaschii tRNAPro contains an A73 discriminator base, which plays an important role in aminoacylation by E. coliProRS (6Liu H. Peterson R. Kessler J. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, human tRNAPro contains a C73, which is not a critical determinant for aminoacylation by the human enzyme (13Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The presence of A73 in M. jannaschiitRNAPro raises the question of whether tRNA recognition by the archaeal ProRS might resemble that of the E. coli enzyme by placing a strong emphasis on acceptor stem recognition. On the other hand, the sequence similarity between the M. jannaschii and human synthetases (Fig. 1) (13Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Bunjun S. Stathopoulos C. Graham D. Min B. Kitabatake M. Wang A.L. Wang C.C. Vivares C.P. Weiss L.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12997-13002Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) suggests that acceptor stem recognition might follow that of the human enzyme, which does not recognize position 73 in a base-specific manner. In addition to aminoacylation of the cognate tRNAPro,M. jannaschii ProRS has the novel ability to also catalyze aminoacylation of M. jannaschii tRNACys with cysteine (22Stathopoulos C. Li T. Longman R. Vothknecht U.C. Becker H.D. Ibba M. Söll D. Science. 2000; 287: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Lipman R.S.A. Sowers K.R. Hou Y.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7792-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This dual functional ProRS is unique to M. jannaschii, its close relatives Methanococcus maripaludis and Methanobacterium thermoautrophicum(22Stathopoulos C. Li T. Longman R. Vothknecht U.C. Becker H.D. Ibba M. Söll D. Science. 2000; 287: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and to the deep-rooted eukaryote Giardia lamblia (21Bunjun S. Stathopoulos C. Graham D. Min B. Kitabatake M. Wang A.L. Wang C.C. Vivares C.P. Weiss L.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12997-13002Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The specific aminoacylation with both proline and cysteine is expected to make unusual demands on the enzyme structure that might include relocation of determinants required for specific aminoacylation ofM. jannaschii tRNAPro compared with those important for the E. coli or human enzymes, which lack this dual function. Here, the results of biochemical studies of tRNAPro recognition by M. jannaschii ProRS, together with an extensive sequence analysis, have provided new insights into these questions. The wild-type gene for M. jannaschii tRNAPro was constructed by oligonucleotide hybridization and ligated into plasmid vectors pTFMa or pF119 according to published procedures (24Hou Y.M. Westhof E. Giegé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6776-6780Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmids were linearized by restriction enzymesNsiI (pTFMa) or FokI (pF119) and transcribedin vitro by T7 RNA polymerase. Point mutations in the gene were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the Mutagene (Bio-Rad) or QuickChange (Strategene) kits and the gene sequences were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. T7 transcripts of the wild-type and mutant genes were purified by denaturing 12%, 7 m urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gene for M. jannaschii ProRS, identified from the genomic data base (25Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D.

Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar), was isolated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the genomic DNA. The amplified gene was cloned into the pET-19 vector (Novagen) behind the sequence encoding the histidine tag, and errors that arose from the polymerase chain reaction were corrected by site-directed mutagenesis. The sequence of the final cloned gene was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing of the entire open reading frame. Expression of the recombinant gene was achieved in E. coli BL21(DE3) grown to anA600 of 0.4–0.6 and induced with 0.1–0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–4 h at 37 °C. The recombinant ProRS was soluble and well expressed and was purified using the Co2+-chelated Talon resin (CLONTECH) or Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of the purified ProRS was determined based on active-site titration using the adenylate burst assay (26Fersht A.R. Ashford J.S. Bruton C.J. Jakes R. Koch G.L. Hartley B.S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Proline and3H-labeled proline (100 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Sigma and PerkinElmer Life Sciences, respectively. Assays were carried out at 60 or 65 °C under conditions described previously (23Lipman R.S.A. Sowers K.R. Hou Y.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7792-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Aminoacylation activity of tRNA mutants with substitutions in the acceptor end was measured with 2.5 nm ProRS and 1.0–16.0 μm tRNA. Values reported are the average of at least three determinations with an average standard deviation of 23.8%. Aminoacylation activity of tRNA mutants with substitutions in the anticodon was measured using 5 nm ProRS and 0.5 μm of a tRNA transcript, which was below the estimatedKm of the tRNA. Preliminary studies indicated that the Km for the wild-type transcript was 1.0 μm (under the experimental conditions) and that of mutants containing substitutions in the anticodon was in the range of 3–6 μm. 2J. Wang and Y.-M. Hou, unpublished observation.Values reported are the average of at least two determinations, which differed by less than 6.1%. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the PILEUP program provided by the Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI). The value of 2.600 was used for the gap creation penalty. Sequences used for alignments were obtained from ProRS sequences in public data bases. Multiple sequence alignments of ProRS, including members from all three domains of life, have divided the enzymes into two distinct groups (13Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Krikliviy I. Tukalo M. Structure. 1998; 6: 101-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). M. jannaschii ProRS is a member of the eukaryotic-like group (Fig. 1), which also includes all eukaryotic enzymes, some eubacterial enzymes (such as mycoplasma and spirochetes), and T. thermophilus ProRS. The x-ray crystal structure of the T. thermophilus enzyme is known and is shown in Fig. 1. The prokaryotic-like group of ProRS includes the majority of the eubacterial enzymes as well as the mitochondrial enzymes of eucarya. Although there is no known three-dimensional structure of a ProRS from this group, an analysis of the alignments, in addition to the crystal structure of T. thermophilus ProRS, reveal clear structural differences between the two groups. Enzymes of the eukaryotic-like group have an extra C-terminal domain of about 80 residues beyond the anticodon-binding domain. In the structure of T. thermophilus ProRS, this domain binds one atom of zinc, and its extreme C terminus folds back into the conserved catalytic core (14Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Krikliviy I. Tukalo M. Structure. 1998; 6: 101-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, the prokaryotic enzymes have a large insertion domain (about 180 residues) of unknown function between motif 2 and motif 3 (Fig. 1). The UGG isoacceptor was used for studies of tRNA recognition by M. jannaschii ProRS (Fig. 2). This isoacceptor contains three G:C base pairs at the extreme acceptor end and an A73 discriminator base, all of which are conserved in the GGG isoacceptor for tRNAPro (not shown). The features of the acceptor stem in the two known isoacceptors of M. jannaschiitRNAPro thus are notable for the presence of both C72 and A73. This combination is distinct from that found in the corresponding positions of E. coli and human tRNAPro (Fig.4 below). Specifically, the acceptor stem of all eubacterial proline tRNAs contains G72 and A73, both of which are important for aminoacylation (6Liu H. Peterson R. Kessler J. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, the acceptor stem of all eukaryotic proline tRNAs contains C72 and C73, which play only a minor role in aminoacylation (13Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, both the E. coliand human isoacceptors place a strong emphasis on recognition of the anticodon nucleotides G35 and G36.Figure 4The sequence and cloverleaf structures ofE. coli, human, and M. jannaschiitRNAPro. Acceptor stem (boxed) and anticodon nucleotide (circled) positions tested in this and previous work are indicated. The arrows point to nucleotides that are the specificity determinants for the respective cognate synthetase, as determined by in vitro aminoacylation kinetics. The absence of an arrow indicates that the position is not a recognition element. The size of an arrow indicates the relative importance of the element as follows. A small arrowindicates a minor (2–12-fold) effect, a medium arrowindicates that at least one mutation tested had a large (>100-fold) effect, and a large arrow indicates that all three mutations had a >100-fold effect on thekcat/Km of aminoacylation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To compare the distribution of M. jannaschiitRNAPro specificity determinants with those of E. coli and human, mutations were introduced into the acceptor stem and the anticodon. Variants containing a single substitution of C72 or A73, or of one of the anticodon nucleotides, were created by site-directed mutagenesis and transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase. Each variant was heat-denatured and refolded into its native state in the presence of Mg2+. Steady-state aminoacylation assays were then carried out, and the catalytic efficiency (expressed askcat /Km) of each mutant relative to that of the wild-type tRNA was determined. As shown in Fig. 2, substitution of A73 in M. jannaschiitRNAPro by any of the other three nucleotides has a small effect (about 10-fold) onkcat /Km. The G73 substitution has the most severe effect (12.2-fold), whereas the C73 or U73 substitution has a smaller effect (2-fold and 6-fold, respectively). The relative decreases in activity are also shown in Fig.3 A, where the initial rates of aminoacylation of the C73, U73, and G73 mutants relative to that of the wild-type are compared. The effects at A73 are minor compared with those previously observed in the E. coli system. In E. colitRNAPro, substitution of A73 with G had a greater than 100-fold effect on aminoacylation, and substitution with the two pyrimidine nucleotides U73 and C73 resulted in 30–40-fold decreases inkcat/Km, respectively (6Liu H. Peterson R. Kessler J. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, A73 is much less significant for M. jannaschii tRNA recognition than it is for the E. coli tRNA. The weak contribution of A73 to recognition by M. jannaschii ProRS, however, is comparable with that of C73 in the human system. Substitution of C73 in the human tRNA with A or G only had an ∼2-fold effect (13Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Position 72 of M. jannaschii tRNAPro also has a minor role in aminoacylation (Fig. 2). Substitution with any other nucleotide has a less than 10-fold effect onkcat /Km. The U substitution results in the largest decrease (5.3-fold), followed by the G substitution (2.2-fold). The A substitution is well tolerated with only a 1.4-fold decrease inkcat /Km. Because of the small effects observed at position 72, additional mutations involving position 1 that would maintain a 1:72 base pair in the acceptor stem were not investigated. In contrast, position 72 is an important specificity determinant for E. coli tRNAPro (6Liu H. Peterson R. Kessler J. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Substitution of G72 in E. coli tRNAPro with either A or U reduces kcat /Kmby more than 150-fold, whereas substitution with C72 has an ∼30-fold effect. Similar to the M. jannaschii system, substitution of C72 in human tRNAPro does not negatively impact aminoacylation by the human enzyme (13Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We next tested mutations in all three anticodon positions of M. jannaschii tRNAPro for their effect on aminoacylation catalytic efficiency. As expected, substitution of U34 with A or G had no effect on aminoacylation, whereas substitution with C resulted in only a 1.3-fold decrease (Fig. 2). The absence of an effect at position 34 is in accordance with results previously obtained in the E. coli and human tRNAs. The anticodon nucleotide G35 of M. jannaschiitRNAPro is a minor determinant for aminoacylation. Substitution of G35 with A has the largest effect (9-fold), followed by the C substitution (8-fold), and the U substitution (1.5-fold) (Fig.2). The magnitude of these effects is similar to those observed in theE. coli tRNA but is minor compared with those in the human tRNA. In the latter case, the substitution of G35 with any other nucleotides results in a large decrease in catalytic efficiency (120–460-fold) (13Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Of all the positions tested in this study, the most important specificity determinant in M. jannaschii tRNAProis G36. Substitution with C alone reduces thekcat /Km of aminoacylation by 250-fold, and substitution with A results in a nearly 40-fold decrease (Fig. 2). The exception is the U substitution, which maintains akcat /Km that is similar to that of the wild-type tRNA. A representative aminoacylation assay of the C36, A36, and U36 mutants relative to that of the wild-type (initial rate data) is also shown in Fig. 3 B. Interestingly, although the magnitude of the effects observed upon mutagenesis of G36 differs somewhat among the three tRNA species (E. coli, human, and M. jannaschii), the order of sensitivity to the different nucleotide substitutions is the same. That is, in all cases, substitution with C has the most severe effect, followed by A, and then U. The relative importance of the acceptor stem and anticodon recognition elements in E. coli, human, and M. jannaschiitRNAs is summarized in Fig. 4. Although the nucleotides at position 72 and 73 in the acceptor stem are major determinants in E. coli tRNA, they are only minor determinants in M. jannaschii tRNA and are even less important in human tRNA. Conversely, although G35 in the anticodon is the most important determinant in the human tRNA, it is a minor determinant in both the E. coli and M. jannaschiisystems. However, all three tRNAs maintain a strong emphasis on G36 as a specificity determinant, and in the case of M. jannaschiitRNA, it is the only nucleotide tested that makes a major contribution to aminoacylation. Thus, as with the human system, anticodon recognition is more important than acceptor stem recognition forM. jannaschii ProRS. However, the details of anticodon recognition appear to be more similar to that of the E. colisystem. For both E. coli and M. jannaschii ProRS enzymes, position 36 is the primary determinant, whereas for the human enzyme, position 35 is more critical (Fig. 4). From these data, we conclude that there is a shift of emphasis in synthetase recognition from the prokaryotic to the eukaryotic systems. In the former, both acceptor stem and anticodon recognition play approximately equal roles, whereas in the latter, anticodon recognition dominates. Also, we conclude that, within the eukaryotic-like group, there are differences in the details of anticodon recognition. Whereas G35 is the major determinant in the anticodon of the human tRNA, G36 recognition is more important in M. jannaschii tRNA, a trend that is shared by the prokaryotic E. coli tRNA (Fig. 4). The shift in location of tRNA specificity determinants from the prokaryotic (acceptor stem and anticodon) to the eukaryotic systems (primarily anticodon) prompted a closer examination of sequences in the motif 2 loop of the respective synthetases. Specific sequences within the motif 2 loop of many class II synthetases, including E. coli ProRS, have been identified as important for recognition of the acceptor stem. In particular, the RPR sequence, conserved in all eubacterial ProRS enzymes, is critical for aminoacylation by E. coli ProRS (12Burke B. Yang F. Chen F. Stehlin C. Chan B. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15540-15547Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Substitution of the first R in this sequence (R144) reduceskcat /Km of aminoacylation by more than 1000-fold but does not affect amino acid activation, indicating a role exclusively in tRNA recognition. Cross-linking experiments also confirmed that this R is proximal to the critical G72 nucleotide of the E. coli tRNAPro acceptor stem. In contrast, mutation of the corresponding position in the human enzyme (K1084) had no effect on human tRNAPro aminoacylation, a result that is in accordance with the lack of base-specific acceptor stem recognition in the eukaryotic system (12Burke B. Yang F. Chen F. Stehlin C. Chan B. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15540-15547Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). An extensive sequence alignment of the motif 2 loop of ProRS from 54 species, consisting of diverse members of the prokaryotic-like and eukaryotic-like groups, was performed. A representative subset of the aligned sequences is presented in Fig. 5. Although the RPRXG motif is strictly conserved within the prokaryotic-like enzymes, it is absent from the eukaryotic-like group and is replaced by the less conserved KHXXP motif. For example, M. jannaschii ProRS has the sequence KHTRP, whereas the corresponding sequence in the human enzyme is KHPQP. Although the function of the KHXXP motif is not entirely clear, mutagenesis of individual amino acids within this sequence of the human enzyme had little effect on aminoacylation (12Burke B. Yang F. Chen F. Stehlin C. Chan B. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15540-15547Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on the relatively minor role of tRNAPro acceptor stem recognition by M. jannaschii ProRS (Fig. 1), a similar result is predicted for this system, and experiments to test this hypothesis are under way. Thus, the shift of tRNA specificity determinants from the acceptor end in E. coli tRNAPro to the anticodon end in the human tRNA is accompanied by changes in protein motifs that recognize the acceptor end. The M. jannaschii enzyme is segregated with the human enzyme in the sequence alignment, and this segregation is consistent with the weak of tRNA acceptor end recognition. In contrast to acceptor stem recognition, the pattern of anticodon recognition by M. jannaschii ProRS is more similar to that of the E. coli enzyme than that of the human enzyme. Both the M. jannaschii and E. coli enzymes emphasize G36 more than G35, whereas the opposite holds true for the human enzyme. However, despite functional similarity with the E. coli enzyme, sequence motifs in the anticodon-binding domain of the M. jannaschii enzyme more closely resemble those of the human synthetase (Fig. 6). For example, the M. jannaschii and human enzymes share the conserved RXE motif, where R is position 336 and 1294 in M. jannaschii and human ProRS, respectively. This residue is believed to contact G36 in the tRNA anticodon, as predicted by the co-crystal structure of T. thermophilus ProRS complexed with the anticodon domain of tRNAPro (15Yaremchuk A. Cusack S. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4745-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The E. colienzyme instead has the sequence TIV (where T is at position 531). Also, although the M. jannaschii and human enzymes share the conserved EXXX(R/K)D motif (E338 in M. jannaschiiProRS and E1296 in human ProRS), which is believed to contact G35 in the anticodon, the E. coli enzyme has the VXXXRN motif (V533 in E. coli ProRS). Thus, although the M. jannaschii enzyme has remained segregated with the human enzyme in its anticodon-binding sequence, the details of anticodon recognition appear to have diverged. The functional divergence in anticodon recognition by M. jannaschii ProRS, despite the sequence similarity with the eukaryotic-like group, may be because of the requirement of the archaeal enzyme to also recognize and specifically aminoacylate tRNACys with cysteine. The anticodon of M. jannaschii tRNACys is GCA, which is significantly different from the (U/G)GG anticodon of tRNAPro. The lack of strong recognition at position 35, which is opposite from that of the human enzyme (Fig. 4), may be important for its unusual dual recognition capability. The molecular basis for how M. jannaschii ProRS recognizes tRNACys is currently being investigated. In summary, the investigation of tRNA recognition by the archaealM. jannaschii ProRS and comparison of this recognition with that of the E. coli and human enzymes have provided evidence of divergent adaptation between the tRNA and synthetase. The archaeal enzyme parallels the human enzyme with regard to acceptor stem recognition, in agreement with their sequence similarity in the motif 2 loop region. In particular, the minor role of A73 in recognition byM. jannaschii ProRS is similar to the lack of recognition of C73 by the human enzyme. These results are in contrast to the strong recognition of this discriminator base nucleotide (A73), as well as G72, by the E. coli enzyme. With regard to recognition of the anticodon, the archaeal enzyme has diverged from the human enzyme, despite their sequence similarity. One manifestation of the divergence is the shift of focus from G35 to G36. The diminished role of G35 for the archaeal enzyme may reflect its dual function in recognition of both tRNAPro and tRNACys, which contains C35. The mechanistic details of this dual specificity remain to be elucidated. We thank Hiromi Motegi for technical support."
https://openalex.org/W1986654056,"The serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) has a dual function: 1) it plays an important role as a direct inhibitor of the plasminogen activation system, and 2) its interaction with the adhesive glycoprotein vitronectin suggests a role in tissue remodeling and metastasis, independent from its proteinase inhibitory properties. Unique to this serpin is the close association between its conformational and functional properties. Indeed, PAI-1 can occur in an active and a latent conformation, but both functions are exclusively present in the active conformation. We report here the epitope localization and functional effects of a monoclonal antibody (MA-124K1) that inhibits rat PAI-1 activity and simultaneously increases the binding of inactive PAI-1 to vitronectin (the affinity constant of PAI-1 for vitronectin is 2 × 107m−1 in the absence of MA-124K1 and 160 × 107m−1 in the presence of MA-124K1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first monoclonal antibody dissociating the proteinase inhibitory properties from the vitronectin binding properties in PAI-1. Mutation of Glu212 and/or Glu220 in rat PAI-1 to Ala results in a strongly reduced affinity or absence of binding to MA-124K1. The three-dimensional structure of PAI-1 reveals that these residues constitute a conformational epitope close to the reactive-site loop and compatible with the effect of MA-124K1 on the inhibitory properties of PAI-1. However, the vitronectin binding site is localized at the opposite site of the molecule, indicating that the effect of MA-124K1 involves an allosteric modulation of the vitronectin binding site. Cell culture experiments revealed a significant reduction of cell attachment and migration in the presence of MA-124K1, providing evidence for the functional relevance of this antibody-mediated up-regulation of the vitronectin binding properties of PAI-1. In conclusion, a novel mechanism for interference with PAI-1 functions has been identified and is of importance in the modulation of cell migration and related events (e.g. tumor metastasis). The serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) has a dual function: 1) it plays an important role as a direct inhibitor of the plasminogen activation system, and 2) its interaction with the adhesive glycoprotein vitronectin suggests a role in tissue remodeling and metastasis, independent from its proteinase inhibitory properties.

In conclusion, a novel mechanism for interference with PAI-1 functions has been identified and is of importance in the modulation of cell migration and related events (e.g. tumor metastasis). t-PA, tissue-type plasminogen activator urokinase-type plasminogen activator The plasminogen/plasmin system plays an important role in the hemostatic balance through dissolution of fibrin and in a variety of pericellular events, including cell migration and angiogenesis, through activation of matrix metalloproteinases, cytokines, and growth factors (1Dano K. Andreasen P. Grondahl-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Nielsen L.S. Skriver L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 44: 139-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar, 2Chapman H.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 714-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)1 is the primary inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). Because of its antiproteolytic properties, elevated levels of PAI-1 are associated with several thrombotic diseases such as myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, and obesity (3Declerck P.J. Juhan-Vague I. Felez J. Wiman B. J. Intern. Med. 1994; 236: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4Wiman B. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. Suppl. 1999; 230: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, PAI-1 is generally assumed to play a role in tissue remodeling and tumor metastasis (5Sugiura Y. Ma L. Sun B. Shimada H. Laug W.E. Seeger R.C. DeClerck Y.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1327-1336PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, its proteinase inhibitory role at the extracellular matrix is further stressed by the observation that the active form of PAI-1 is bound to and stabilized by vitronectin, a major constituent of the extracellular matrix, thereby resulting in a mechanism allowing directed control of proteolytic events in the extracellular environment. Vitronectin belongs to the group of adhesive glycoproteins playing an important role in the attachment of cells to their surrounding matrix and may participate in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and morphogenesis. Its cell binding properties are mediated through interactions between cellular integrins and the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequence in the N-terminal region of vitronectin (6Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar). The vitronectin binding properties of PAI-1 have reinforced the role of PAI-1 in these pericellular processes and extended its role beyond its proteinase inhibitory properties. Indeed, PAI-1 has been shown to inhibit cell migration through interference with the binding of the integrin αvβ3 to vitronectin (7Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). This interference is most likely due to the fact that the PAI-1 binding region in vitronectin is also located in the N-terminal region (8Kjoller L. Kanse S.M. Kirkegaard T. Rodenburg K.W. Ronne E. Goodman S.L. Preissner K.T. Ossowski L. Andreasen P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 9Seiffert D. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 705-710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, PAI-1 plays a dual role in extravascular processes, on the one hand via its capacity to inhibit plasminogen activators, and on the other hand via its capacity to prevent cell adhesion. Currently, the relative contribution of both functions to the effects of PAI-1 in tumor development, metastasis, and angiogenesis remains elusive. Whereas the prevention of tumor invasion and neovascularization due to the absence of host PAI-1 have been suggested to be due to an excess of proteolytic activity (10Bajou K. Noël A. Gerard R.D. Masson V. Brunner N. Holst-Hansen C. Skobe M. Fusenig N.E. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Foidart J.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), high levels of PAI-1 have been suggested to prevent cell migration (and subsequent metastasis) consequent to its vitronectin binding properties (7Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 8Kjoller L. Kanse S.M. Kirkegaard T. Rodenburg K.W. Ronne E. Goodman S.L. Preissner K.T. Ossowski L. Andreasen P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Whereas its proteinase inhibitory properties reside in the reactive-site loop, the vitronectin binding properties have been suggested to reside on the opposite side of the molecule (i.e. a region comprising αhC, αhE, and βs1A). In active PAI-1, both properties are present, whereas in latent PAI-1, both properties are absent consequent to conformational changes. In the present study, we present a monoclonal antibody (MA-124K1) that can inhibit rat PAI-1 activity and simultaneously increase the binding of inactivated PAI-1 to vitronectin. Elucidation of the exact binding site (epitope) for MA-124K1 is indispensable to unravel the molecular mechanism of its functional effects on PAI-1 and reveals how the two functions can be dissociated from each other and can be modulated in the opposite direction. The obtained data illustrate the feasibility of an allosteric up-regulation of the vitronectin binding properties of PAI-1. Recombinant rat PAI-1, human PAI-1, and rat/human PAI-1 chimeras were produced as described previously (11Gils A. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J.

Human t-PA (predominantly in the single-chain form) was a kind gift from Boehringer Ingelheim (Brussels, Belgium), and human u-PA (consisting of a mixture of high and low molecular weight u-PA in a 75:25 ratio) was a kind gift from Bournonville Pharma (Braine l'Alleud, Belgium). Monoclonal antibodies against rat and human PAI-1 were produced as described previously (14Debrock S. Declerck P.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Ngo T.H. Verheyen S. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Life Technologies, Inc., and Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Pfu TurboTM DNA polymerase was purchased from Stratagene; synthetic oligonucleotides (for mutagenesis and DNA sequencing) were synthesized by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cell culture medium (RPMI 1640) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. DNA manipulation techniques were carried out according to standard procedures and following the instructions of the manufacturers. Plasmid DNA was isolated using Nucleobond® cartridges (Macherey-Nagel). DNA was sequenced with the Autoread Sequencing® kit and the Automated Laser Fluorescent ALF® apparatus (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Polymerase chain reaction was performed using the GeneAmp® 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Mutants were created using a method based on the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Therefore, pIGE2-rat-PAI-1 was used as template to generate pIGE2-rat-PAI-1-E181 (Glu181 to Ala), pIGE2-rat-PAI-1-H185 (His185 to Ala), pIGE2-rat-PAI-1-R187 (Arg187 to Ala), pIGE2-rat-PAI-1-E212 (Glu212 to Ala), pIGE2-rat-PAI-1-H219 (His219 to Ala), pIGE2-rat-PAI-1-E220 (Glu220 to Ala), pIGE2-rat-PAI-1-D222 (Asp222 to Ala), pIGE2-rat-PAI-1-E242 (Glu242 to Ala), pIGE2-rat-PAI-1-K243 (Lys243 to Ala), pIGE2-rat-PAI-1-D244 (Asp244 to Ala), pIGE2-rat-PAI-1-D255 (Asp255 to Ala), pIGE2-rat-PAI-1-E257 (Glu257 to Ala), and pIGE2-rat-PAI-1- R260 (Arg260 to Ala) using the appropriate oligonucleotides containing the desired mutations as primer. Polymerase chain reaction was performed essentially as described previously (16Bijnens A.P. Gils A. Knockaert I. Stassen J.M. Declerck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6375-6380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), with slight adaptations of the temperatures used for annealing. Subsequently, the amplified DNA was subjected to aDpnI digestion before transformation of DH1λEscherichia coli. For all mutants, large scale DNA preparations were made and subjected to nucleotide sequencing for confirmation of the mutations. Subsequently, MC1061 E. colicells were cotransformed with pAcI and one of the pIGE2-rat-PAI-1 mutant expression constructs. Expression and purification were performed as described previously (12Ngo T.H. Bijnens A.P. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Fibrinolysis. 1997; 11: 37-43Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). PAI-1 samples were diluted to a concentration of 200 µg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline buffer and incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of t-PA or u-PA at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10–15% gels followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The reaction products formed were quantified by densitometric scanning of the gels (11Gils A. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7474-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) using the Image Master® system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Affinity constants for the binding between proteins were determined using the BIAcoreTM 3000 analytical system equipped with the CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore® AB) as described previously (17Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Lofas S. Stenberg E. Karlsson R. Frostell A. Markey F. Schindler F. Ann. Biol. Clin. Paris. 1993; 51: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, coupling of antibodies to the sensor chip was done according to the instructions of the manufacturer at 10 µg/ml (50-µl fractions). Perfusions of the analyte were in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, containing 1 mmEDTA. PAI-1 was perfused at a concentration of 50 nm at a flow rate of 10 µl/min. When indicated, in a subsequent step vitronectin (50 nm) was perfused at a flow rate of 10 µl/min. Rate constants were determined using BIAevaluationTM 3.0 software, and affinity constants were calculated ask on/k off. PAI-1 activity was measured as described previously (15Ngo T.H. Verheyen S. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Antibody-induced inactivation of PAI-1 was evaluated through quantitation of residual PAI-1 activity after incubation of PAI-1 with antibody. Briefly, 20 ng/ml rat PAI-1 (∼50–60% active), in either the presence or absence of vitronectin (10 µg/ml), was incubated (25 min, 37 °C) with monoclonal antibody at concentrations ranging from 8 µg/ml to 60 ng/ml using serial 2-fold dilutions. Binding of PAI-1 to immobilized vitronectin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using plates coated with rat, murine, or human vitronectin (1 µg/ml) for capture and MA-8M7-HRP (against rat PAI-1) (15Ngo T.H. Verheyen S. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) for detection. PAI-1 (100 ng/ml) was incubated with monoclonal antibody (2-fold serial dilutions, concentrations ranging from 5 µg/ml to 40 ng/ml) or buffer at 37 °C for 25 min before application to the wells. Then the plates were incubated in a moist chamber overnight at 4 °C followed by detection of bound PAI-1 using MA-8M7-HRP. Association between PAI-1 and soluble vitronectin was investigated using the following enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: MA-16A7 (antibody raised against human vitronectin and cross-reacting with rat vitronectin) 2T.-H. Ngo and P. J. Declerck, unpublished observations. was used for capture (4 µg/ml), and MA-8M7-HRP was used for tagging. Mixtures of PAI-1 (100 ng/ml) with vitronectin (1 µg/ml) were incubated with buffer or with monoclonal antibody (as described above) for 25 min at 37 °C before application to the wells. Plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a moist chamber followed by detection of bound vitronectin-PAI-1 complex using MA-8M7-HRP. Fab fragments of monoclonal antibody MA-124K1 were produced by digestion (2 h at 37 °C) of MA-124K1 (5 mg/ml) with papain (50 µg/ml) in the presence of EDTA (1 mm) and cysteine (10 mm). Subsequently, the sample was dialyzed against Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.3), and Fab fragments were separated from intact IgG or Fc fragment through application on protein A-Sepharose. Non-protein A-binding fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before pooling of the Fab-containing fractions. The rat prostate cell line (AT-6 Dunning R3327) (18Oosterhof G.O.N. Cornel E.B. Smits G.A.H.J. Debruyne F.M.J. Schalken J.A. Eur. Urol. 1997; 32: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. J. A. Schalken (University Hospital, Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Attachment and migration assays were basically designed as described previously (7Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). In brief, washed cells were resuspended in serum-free media supplemented with rat PAI-1 (active, latent, or mutant form) and/or monoclonal antibodies (MA-124K1, MA-32K3) at the indicated concentrations. In attachment assays, cells (3.5 × 104 cells/well) were allowed to attach to vitronectin-coated plates (1 µg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Plates were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by fixation of attached cells using methanol/acetic acid (75:25, v/v) and subsequent staining with 2% methylene blue. The stained cells were counted under the microscope with Leica image software. In migration assays, cells were added (2 × 105 cells/well) into the upper chamber of transwells (8-µm pore size) coated with rat vitronectin (100 µg/ml). After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cell layer in the upper chamber was removed with a rubber swab, and cells that migrated toward the lower part of the membrane were removed by trypsinization. Cells were subsequently counted (Coulter® and Leica image software). Vitronectin-dependent attachment and migration were expressed as a percentage versus the control (i.e. in the absence of monoclonal antibodies and PAI-1). Preliminary experiments by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed that the active form of rat PAI-1 binds to vitronectin, whereas the latent form does not (data not shown). Incubation of rat PAI-1 with the inhibitory monoclonal antibody MA-124K1 (19Ngo T.H. Declerck P.J. Fibrinolysis Proteolysis. 1998; 12: 335-339Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) resulted in a dose-dependent increase of the binding of PAI-1 to vitronectin (Fig.1 A). A virtually identical dose-dependent effect was observed with Fab fragments of MA-124K1. A noninhibitory control anti-PAI-1 antibody (MA-32K3) did not affect the binding. No binding was observed when vitronectin was replaced with bovine serum albumin. Interestingly, latent rat PAI-1 and preformed complexes between rat PAI-1 and t-PA or u-PA also exhibited strongly increased binding to vitronectin in the presence of MA-124K1 (Fig. 1 B). To exclude possible artifacts as a result of the use of immobilized vitronectin, comparable experiments were performed using soluble vitronectin (see “Experimental Procedures”) that yielded similar observations (Fig. 1 A). Evaluation of the affinity of the binding between PAI-1 and vitronectin in the absence (K a = 2 × 107m−1) or presence of MA-124K1 (K a = 160 × 107m−1) or Fab fragments thereof (K a = 170 × 107m−1) revealed that interaction between PAI-1 and the antigen binding site of MA-124K1 resulted in an 80-fold increased affinity of PAI-1 for vitronectin. As shown in Fig.2, the PAI-1 neutralizing properties of MA-124K1 were potentiated in the presence of vitronectin. Evaluation of the differential binding of MA-124K1 to various rat/human PAI-1 chimeras revealed that the epitope was localized in the region from amino acid 187 to amino acid 277 (Fig.3). Subsequently, differences in binding properties of MA-124K1 to PAI-1 from different species (human, rat, porcine, rabbit, and murine) and sequence differences between PAI-1 from different species within the amino acid 187–277 region, combined with localization in the three-dimensional structure of PAI-1, resulted in the initial selection of the following five residues as possible candidates to contribute to the epitope: Glu220, Asp244, Asp255, Glu257, and Arg260 (all residues were charged, located at the surface, and nonconserved between rat PAI-1 and PAI-1 from non-cross-reacting species). In addition, residues Glu181, His185, and Arg187(charged, surface-localized, and not necessarily fully nonconserved) were also considered in this first round because these are located in the vicinity of other selected residues and may therefore potentially contribute to the epitope (16Bijnens A.P.

Generation and preliminary characterization of the corresponding alanine mutants (i.e. respective residue replaced by alanine) (small scale expression, not purified) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (data not shown) revealed that only rat-PAI-1-E220A had a strongly reduced binding to MA-124K1. Therefore, in a second selection round, the surface around position 220 was scanned (on the three-dimensional structure) for other residues possibly contributing to the epitope. Based upon distance measurements, charge, and surface localization, the residues at positions Glu212, His219, Asp222, Glu242, and Lys243 and either one of these residues in combination with residue 220 were mutated to an alanine and evaluated for their binding properties to MA-124K1. Preliminary evaluation of the binding between MA-124K1 and these rat PAI-1 variants indicated that, in addition to rat-PAI-1-E220A, only rat-PAI-1-E212A and the combination mutant rat-PAI-1-E212A/E220A exhibited a decreased binding to MA-124K1. Further scanning of the area around position 212 revealed the absence of any other charged residues. It was therefore concluded that Glu220 and Glu212 constitute the main molecular determinants of the epitope for MA-124K1. The corresponding mutants (rat-PAI-1-E212A, rat-PAI-1-E220A, and rat-PAI-1-E212A/E220A) were then purified on a large scale for further detailed characterization and evaluation of their binding affinity to MA-124K1. All three mutants exhibited inhibitory activity toward t-PA and u-PA similar to that observed for rat PAI-1 (Table I). Incubation of rat PAI-1 or the mutants for 24 h at 37 °C resulted in a complete loss of inhibitory activity, predominantly due to conversion of the active conformation to the latent conformation (data not shown). However, slight differences were observed when comparing the rate of the active transition to that of the latent transition (TableII). Rat-PAI-1-E212A and rat-PAI-1-E212A/E220A are characterized by a 2.5-fold longer half-life compared with that of rat PAI-1. The half-life of rat-PAI-1-E220A was nearly identical to that of rat PAI-1.Table IConformational distribution of rat PAI-1 and rat PAI-1 mutantsActiveLatentSubstrateversus t-PARat PAI-151 ± 3.942 ± 3.36.6 ± 0.6Rat-PAI-1-E212A50 ± 8.745 ± 1.85.5 ± 6.2Rat-PAI-1-E220A44 ± 9.947 ± 4.78.9 ± 5.2Rat-PAI-1-E212A/E220A46 ± 2.649 ± 0.35.8 ± 2.3versus u-PARat PAI-148 ± 2.846 ± 2.05.4 ± 1.8Rat-PAI-1-E212A48 ± 8.146 ± 5.16.1 ± 3.0Rat-PAI-1-E220A44 ± 3.350 ± 4.36.7 ± 1.0Rat-PAI-1-E212A/E220A47 ± 0.546 ± 2.57.0 ± 2.0Values are the mean ± SD, n = 3; expressed as a percentage of total PAI-1 protein.

Evaluation of the affinity constants using surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that the affinity of MA-124K1 for all three mutants was significantly reduced compared with that for rat PAI-1 (Table III). A single mutation at position 220 resulted in a 14-fold decreased affinity, whereas a single mutation at position 212 or a combination of both mutations resulted in a complete absence of binding.Table IIIAffinity (Ka) of rat PAI-1 and its mutants to MA-124K1Rat PAI-1 variantsAffinity (K a)m−1Rat PAI-160.3 ± 2.8 × 107Rat-PAI-1-E212ANB3-aNB, no binding.Rat-PAI-1-E220A4.2 ± 0.8 × 107Rat-PAI-1-E212A/E220ANBValues are the mean ± SD, n = 3.3-a NB, no binding.

The Fab fragments: 1) exhibited a full inhibitory effect toward rat PAI-1, as observed for MA-124K1 (Fig. 4), 2) had a similar affinity for rat PAI-1 (K a = 63 × 107m−1), and 3) had the same effect as MA-124K1 on the vitronectin binding properties of rat PAI-1 (Fig. 1). As reported previously (7Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), active PAI-1 exerted a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on cell attachment and migration. Strikingly, addition of MA-124K1 significantly increased (p < 0.03) the effect of active PAI-1 on attachment and migration (Fig.5). As expected, in the absence of MA-124K1, latent PAI-1 had no effect, whereas in the presence of MA-124K1, cell attachment and migration were inhibited by 50% and 70%, respectively. Mutant rat PAI-1-E212A/E220A (with an activity and vitronectin binding properties comparable to those of wild-type rat PAI-1) has an effect on cell attachment and migration comparable to that observed with active rat PAI-1. In agreement with the absence of interaction between MA-124K1 and rat PAI-1-E212A/E220A, the addition of MA-124K1 did not increase the effect of this mutant. The current study describes a PAI-1-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, MA-124K1, which upon binding to PAI-1 increases the vitronectin binding properties of PAI-1, thereby enhancing its inhibitory effect on cell migration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing a monoclonal antibody (or any other compound) exerting an opposite effect on the two functions of PAI-1. Previous studies describing other PAI-1 inhibitory monoclonal antibodies revealed either no interference with the vitronectin binding properties (20Debrock S. Declerck P.J Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or a decreased binding to vitronectin (21Van Meijer M. Gebbink R.K. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In view of the dual biological effects of PAI-1 associated with these two biochemical properties, the specific functional effects of this antibody open new perspectives in further exploring the relative role of these two biological functions. Binding of PAI-1 to vitronectin has been demonstrated in various species (15Ngo T.H. Verheyen S. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Thromb.

Lindahl T. FEBS Lett. 1988; 242: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The vitronectin binding properties of PAI-1 have therefore led to the generally accepted hypothesis that localization of PAI-1 activity plays a regulatory role in pericellular proteolysis and related events such as tissue remodeling (26Lawrence D.A. Palaniappan S. Stefansson S. Olson S.T. Francis-Chmura A.M. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7676-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27Loskutoff D.J. Curriden S.A. Hu G. Deng G. APMIS. 1999; 107: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Absence of this function in PAI-1 knockout mice has been shown to result in an increased degradation of the extracellular matrix, resulting in impaired neovascularization and prevention of cancer invasion (10Bajou K. Noël A. Gerard R.D. Masson V. Brunner N. Holst-Hansen C. Skobe M. Fusenig N.E. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Foidart J.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Recently, it was observed that the PAI-1 binding site and the integrin binding site of vitronectin are localized in the same region and that PAI-1 prevents αvβ3 integrin binding to vitronectin and therefore inhibits integrin- and vitronectin-mediated cell migration, independent from its proteinase inhibitory functions (7Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 8Kjoller L. Kanse S.M. Kirkegaard T. Rodenburg K.W. Ronne E. Goodman S.L. Preissner K.T. Ossowski L. Andreasen P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).These antiadhesive properties of PAI-1 have thus been considered to possibly form the basis for antitumoral strategies. Based on these data, we hypothesize that neutralization of PAI-1 activity, together with prevention of cell migration, could form a useful, synergistic antitumoral strategy because both act at different levels. The effect of MA-124K1 on cell attachment and migration further substantiates the biological relevance of our observations. These data also support our hypothesis that up-regulation of the vitronectin binding properties of PAI-1 eventually results in an enhanced impairment of the cell binding properties of vitronectin. This is in full agreement with the underlying molecular mechanism of the PAI-1 antiadhesive properties, i.e. both binding sites on vitronectin (i.e. for PAI-1 and for integrins) are adjacent to each other (7Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 8Kjoller L. Kanse S.M. Kirkegaard T. Rodenburg K.W. Ronne E. Goodman S.L. Preissner K.T. Ossowski L. Andreasen P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 9Seiffert D. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 705-710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), thereby excluding simultaneous binding of both ligands. For a number of reasons (e.g. the inevitable association between its antiproteinase activity and its vitronectin binding properties, and the observation that the active site and the vitronectin binding site are at opposite site of the molecule), it seemed irrational to search for a single compound exhibiting both effects on PAI-1. However, our current observation with MA-124K1 provides evidence that it is possible to develop strategies achieving efficient inactivation of PAI-1 with a concomitant significant increase of its vitronectin binding properties. The loss of affinity of the mutants (rat PAI-1-E212A, rat PAI-1-E220A, and rat PAI-1-E212A/E220A) for the antibody provides evidence for the localization of the epitope. Although residues 212 and 220 are not close in the linear sequence, they are situated close to each other in the three-dimensional structure of PAI-1. In view of the epitope localization and the observed effects of MA-124K1, it is important to note that even though the reactive-site loop (responsible for the antiproteinase properties) and the vitronectin binding region are situated at opposite poles of PAI-1 (28Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Padmanabhan J. Sane D.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6), both have been suggested to be conformationally linked (30Fa M. Karolin J. Aleshkov S. Strandberg L. Johansson L.B. Ny T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13833-13840Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Localization of particular secondary structural elements in the three-dimensional structure may reconcile the observed dual effects with the remote distance of both functional sites and form the molecular basis for the action of MA-124K1. Whereas the binding of MA-124K1 to its epitope (in the vicinity of the reactive-site loop) is most likely to be responsible for the neutralization of the proteinase inhibitory activity, the particular localization of the epitope relative to the vitronectin binding site suggests a transduction of interactions throughout the molecule, corresponding to an allosteric modulation. It is worth mentioning that comparison of the dose-response curves (i.e. Fig. 1 versus Fig. 4) reveals that whereas a 1-fold molar excess of MA-124K1 over PAI-1 results in a maximal effect on the vitronectin binding, a 5-fold or higher excess is required to achieve a maximal inhibition of its proteinase inhibitory properties. This apparent discrepancy further supports the concept that the dual effect of MA-124K1 on both PAI-1 functions is the consequence of two distinct molecular mechanisms. Strikingly, the epitope and the vitronectin binding site are connected through the presence of αhA, αhD, and αhH (Fig. 6). Because allosteric regulation of binding properties often involves α-helical secondary structures (31Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24043-24053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 32Kumar R. Baskakov I.V. Srinivasan G. Bolen D.W. Lee J.C. Thompson E.B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 289: 1387-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that the above-mentioned α-helices participate in the observed intramolecular signal transduction, ultimately resulting in an increased exposure of the vitronectin binding site. Interestingly, MA-124K1 also induces an increased vitronectin binding in latent PAI-1 and in complexes of PAI-1 with t-PA or u-PA. This observation is compatible with the molecular explanation of the MA-124K1 effects because the contribution of αhA, αhD, and αhH to the allosteric effect can be considered to be unaffected by latency or complex formation. Importantly, the binding properties as well as the functional effects of Fab fragments of MA-124K1 are identical to those observed with the intact antibody, demonstrating that the direct interaction with the epitope plays an important role in the functional effects and excluding the possibility that any of the observed effects are an indirect consequence of the bivalency of the antibody. A very similar increase in binding between rat PAI-1 and murine or human vitronectin was also observed (data not shown). This observation is in agreement with previous observations suggesting that the domain for vitronectin binding is conserved in PAI-1 from different species and that the binding domain for PAI-1 in the vitronectin molecule is also highly conserved among vitronectins from different species (21Van Meijer M. Gebbink R.K. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,28Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 88: 9402-9406Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the current study identifies a novel mechanism for simultaneous but opposite interference with both functional properties of PAI-1. The observed unique, allosteric effects of MA-124K1 on PAI-1 and the epitope localization open new perspectives for the rational design of compounds exerting a dual effect on PAI-1 and therefore having putative antitumoral properties.

This will allow the definition of signaling pathways to those factors. It may also suggest strategies for replacing insulin in these processes. The proximal prolactin promoter contains sequences that mediate cell-specific expression and responses to numerous stimuli including insulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF),1 and agents that elevate cAMP. The transcription factor Pit-1 mediates cell type-specific prolactin gene transcription by binding to several sites in the proximal and distal prolactin promoter (1Nelson C. Albert V.R. Elsholz H.P.

Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Pit-1 is a Pou domain protein that is found in pituitary lactotrophs, somatotrophs, and thyrotrophs. Insulin, EGF and cAMP act at an overlapping element at −100/−66 that is also critical for high level basal transcription of the prolactin gene (3Jacob K.K. Stanley F.M. J. Biol.

Overlapping this element is an Ets-factor binding sequence CGGAAA that is repeated at −71/−68. This element was shown to mediate the effects of insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, and EGF (3Jacob K.K. Stanley F.M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, mutation of this multiresponse element causes a profound reduction in basal prolactin gene expression (3Jacob K.K. Stanley F.M. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other transcription factors that interact at this complex element have not been identified, but it is likely that at least one Ets-related factor functions through this element. Expression of the DNA-binding domain of Ets-2 acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of transcription mediated by Ets-related factors. Expression of this inhibitor in GH cells partially blocks both insulin and EGF-increased prolactin-CAT expression (4Jacob K.K. Sap J. Stanley F.M. J. Biol.

The Ets-related proteins are a large family of transcription factors with a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (8Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). This domain has a basic region and a tryptophan-rich section similar to the binding domains found in Myc and Myb. These proteins specifically interact with sequences containing the core trinucleotide GGA. Although this sequence is essential for Ets-factor binding, flanking sequences are also important and may determine the different sequence specificity of these proteins (9LaMarco K.L. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1372-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The Ets-binding domain is also crucial to protein-protein interactions that determine the biological function of the DNA-protein interaction (10Lim F. Kraut N. Frampton J. Graf T. EMBO. 1992; 11: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The activity of Ets-related factors was shown to be altered by phosphorylation (11Coffer P. de Jonge M. Mettouchi A. Binetray B. Ghysdail J. Kruiher W. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 911-921PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBPs belong to the bZip family of transcription factors. These have a conserved COOH-terminal domain containing a basic DNA-binding domain and a leucine zipper that mediates protein/protein interaction. At least 6 different genes have been identified that produce C/EBP-related proteins, c/ebpα, c/ebpβ,c/ebpγ, c/ebpδ, c/ebgε, andc/ebpζ (12Cao Z. Umek R. McKnight S.

Thus, C/EBPα is found in alternately translated 42- and 30-kDa forms. The 42-kDa form is initiated from the first start codon and activates gene transcription while the 30-kDa protein is initiated from the third start codon and has been shown to be inhibitory (16Hemati N.

These proteins can bind to DNA only as homo- or heterodimers and heterodimerization between stimulatory and inhibitory bZIP proteins has been shown to be important in regulating their activity. The consensus DNA binding sequence for bZIP proteins is T(T/G)NNGNAA(T/G) (17Huang J.H. Liao W.S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4475-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). C/EBPs are expressed only in terminally differentiated tissues such as liver and adipocytes. C/EBPs have been linked to numerous genes that are regulated by insulin and/or cAMP such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (14Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Nizielski S.E. Hakimi P. Cao Z. Moorman A. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 613-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene (18Tae H.J. Luo X. Kim K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Physical interactions between transcription factors are known to be important for a number of processes. The recruitment of CBP/p300 by phosphorylated CREB was shown to account for the activity of CREB (19Chrivla J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). The activity of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors is modulated by a number of co-repressors and co-activators all of which physically interact (20McKenna N. Lanz R. O'Malley B. Endo. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). C/EBPε directly interacts with the DNA-binding domain of c-Myb (21Verbeek W. Gombart A. Chumakov A. Muller C. Freedman A. Koeffler H. Blood. 1999; 93: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Ets-related factors Elk-1 and Sap-1 were identified as proteins interacting with serum response factor on the c-fos promoter (22Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 23Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 76: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Previous studies identified Ets-related proteins in GH4 cells and nuclear extracts from GH4 cells (3Jacob K.K. Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25515-25520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggested that an Ets-related transcription factor mediated insulin increased prolactin gene expression (6Jacob K.K. Ouyang L. Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27773-27779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Ouyang L. Jacob K.K. Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10425-10428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, plasmids that expressed LexA fusion proteins of a variety of Ets-related factors were prepared. Insulin-increased CAT expression was observed only with the fusion proteins containing the ternary complex factors Elk-1 and Sap-1 (22Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). The observation that knockdown of Elk-1 reduced insulin-increased prolactin gene expression commensurate with Elk-1 reduction indicated that Elk-1 was required for insulin sensitivity. This was supported by transformation of Rat-2 and CHO cells to insulin-sensitive phenotype by Elk-1 expression (Sap-1 is naturally expressed in those cell lines). However, insulin-sensitive transcription in CHO cells also required C/EBPα. Thus, both Elk-1 is required for insulin-increased prolactin gene expression under conditions where Pit-1 and C/EBPα support basal transcription of the gene. TnT lysates for transcription translation were purchased from Promega. Glutathione-agarose, acetyl-CoA, and silica gel plates were obtained from Sigma. Reagents used for gel electrophoresis were purchased from Fisher Scientific. A filter binding kit for preparation of mRNA was purchased from Trevigen. The Calypso single tube reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit was from Tetralink. Antibody to LexA was from Upstate Biotechnology and anti-hemagglutinin antibody was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Antibody to Elk-1, Sap-1, SRF, and C/EBPα were from Santa Cruz. Secondary antibodies were from Kierkegard and Perry. Substrate for chemiluminescence was from Pierce. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Operon. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and iron-supplemented calf serum were obtained from Hyclone Laboratories. All other reagents were of the highest purity available and were obtained from Sigma, Bio-Rad, Eastman, Fisher, orRoche Molecular Biochemicals. The construction of pPrl-CAT plasmids containing −173/+75 of prolactin 5′-flanking DNA was described (24Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13444-13448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human insulin expression vector, pRT3HIR2, was the gift of Dr. J. Whittaker (Hagedorn Research Institute, Gentofte, Denmark). The plasmid CMV-GABPα was provided by Dr. C. Thompson (Carnegie Institute, Baltimore, MD). Plasmids containing the cDNA for Elk-1, Sap-1, and SRF were the gift of Dr. R. Treisman (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom). Dr. R. Maurer (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR) generously provided a plasmid containing the cDNA for human c-Ets-1. The expression plasmid for human Elf-1 was from Dr. J. Leiden (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). The cDNA for C/EBPα was the gift of Dr. S. L. McKnight (Tularik, S. San Francisco, CA). The CAT reporter, Lex6X-CAT, and the LexA expression plasmid, pEG202, were gifts of Dr. R. Brent (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The plasmid Lex6X-CAT contains 3 ColE1 operators, each containing 2 LexA operator sites, inserted into the β-globin promoter at the XhoI site (125 base pairs from the β-globin start of transcription). The pEG202 is a vector for expression of the LexA DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–202) in yeast. Therefore, a HindIII/XhoI fragment from this plasmid that contained the LexA cDNA and the polylinker was recloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to make LexApcDNA3. The cDNAs for the various Ets-related transcription factors (Elk-1, Sap-1, Elf-1, Ets-1, GABPα, and GABPβ) were used as templates in PCR reactions to produce cDNAs having restriction sites suitable for cloning into LexA-pcDNA3. The cDNAs were then cloned COOH-terminal to and in-frame with the LexA cDNA in this vector. These LexA-Ets-related protein expression vectors containing various fractions of the wild type protein are listed in the appropriate figure legends. The cDNAs for Elk-1 and Sap-1 were also cloned into pcDNA3 to make plasmids pcDNA-Elk and pcDNA-Sap. The plasmid pGEXkg-C/EBPα that expresses a glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-C/EBPα fusion protein was constructed by inserting the NcoI fragment of C/EBPα into the vector pGEXkg. The NcoI insert includes amino acids 1 to 353 of C/EBPα. GST-Elk-(105/350) and GST-Sap-(95/340) were made by cloning a PCR fragment into the EcoRI site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The production of the correct sized fusion proteins in yeast and/or tissue culture was verified by Western blotting with antibodies to LexA, Elk-1, Sap, and C/EBPα. Electroporation experiments and CAT assays were performed as described (25Stanley F.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1627-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). GH4 cells were placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium that contained 10% hormone-depleted serum for 24 h, harvested with an EDTA solution, and 20–40 × 106 cells were used for each electroporation. Trypan blue exclusion before electroporation ranged from 95 to 99%. The voltage of the electroporation was 1550 volts. This gives trypan blue exclusion of 70 to 80% after electroporation. The transfected cells were then plated in multiwell dishes (Falcon Plastics) at 5 × 106 cells/9-cm2 tissue culture well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% hormone-depleted serum. Cells were refed at 24 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% hormone-depleted serum ± EGF (40 ng/ml recombinant human EGF, R & D), insulin (1 μg/ml bovine insulin, Calbiochem), or cAMP (0.1 mm, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate, Sigma). After 48 h, the wells were washed three times with normal saline and frozen. CAT activity was assayed essentially as described previously (26Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16719-16726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that [14C]chloramphenicol was replaced with BODIPY chloramphenicol (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and fluorescence intensity was measured using a FluoroImager 575 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) with ImageQuant software. Control of transfection efficiency was performed using a Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase expression plasmid. Briefly, 2 μg of Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase expression plasmid was included in the experiments. The β-galactosidase activity in the cell lysates was determined usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. Transfection efficiency did not vary significantly among transfections performed at the same time. The percent acetylation was then corrected for minor variations in β-galactosidase activity by converting the percent acetylation to percent acetylation/A 430β-galactosidase activity/mg of protein. The fold stimulation or inhibition was then determined. Statistical analysis was performed on all experiments and p values are presented for relevant comparisons. Glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) were mixed with bacterial lyastes containing GST fusion protein or GST. The beads were then washed extensively to remove unbound proteins. The amount of GST fusion protein or GST on the beads was estimated by dye binding after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and equal amounts of glutathione-agarose bound GST fusion protein or GST were used in each incubation. l-[35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were prepared using TNT reticulocyte lysates (Promega). Approximately equal amounts of 35S-labeled protein (as estimated from gel band using ImageQuant software, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used in each incubation. The incubation was carried out for 1 h at 4 °C in 300 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 6% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with incubation buffer. The beads were then resuspended in SDS sample buffer and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. mRNA was prepared using a filter binding protocol (Trevigen). The amount of mRNA was estimated from the absorbance at 260/280 nm. The ratio of the optical density at 260 nm to the optical density at 280 nm was generally 2 or greater. Approximately equal amounts of mRNA (∼0.1 μg) were then used with primers for the mRNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in a single tube RT-PCR assay (Tetra Link, Amherst, NY). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers were459GATTGTCAGCAATGCATCCTGCAC482 and996CACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCATATTC973. The PCR was carried out at 94 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 68 °C for 20 s. In all of the RT-PCR experiments, the number of PCR cycles was adjusted to achieve linearity. For glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 25 cycles were used to maintain linearity and samples varied less than ±25%. The RT-PCR product from this reaction was quantitated using a FluoroImager 575 and ImageQuant software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equal amounts of mRNA (based on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signal) were then used for assay of C/EBPα, Elk-1, Pit-1, and Sap-1 mRNAs. Elk-1 primers were1063GTAGAAGGGCCCAAGGAAGAGTTG1086 and1527CTGGGCGCTGCCACTGGATGGAAACTGGAA1498. Elk-1 PCR was carried out for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 68 °C for 20 s. Sap-1 primers were891GCTTTTGCCACCACACCACCCATTTCG917 and1392GCCCAGACAGAGTGAATGGCCCATGACTG1364. Sap-1 PCR was carried out for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 68 °C for 20 s. C/EBPα primers were820GCCAAGAAGTCGGTGGATAAGAAC843 and968CGGTCATTGTCACTGGTCAACTCC945. C/EBPα PCR was carried out for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 68 °C for 5 s. Pit-1 primers were190TCTGTGCCTTCCTGTCATTATGG212 and684CCTCCGTTTCCTCTTCCTTTCG663. Pit-1 PCR was carried out for 25 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 68 °C for 30 s. Previous studies (3Jacob K.K. Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25515-25520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Jacob K.K. Ouyang L. Stanley F.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10425-10428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) suggested that insulin-increased prolactin gene expression was mediated by an Ets-related transcription factor. Therefore, LexA fusion proteins were constructed with a variety of Ets-related transcription factors to determine whether any of these could mediate the effects of insulin. LexA was chosen instead of the more common Gal4 since the Gal4 operator contains an Ets-response element and is strongly activated by insulin in GH4 cells. 2K. K. Jacob and F. M. Stanley, unpublished observation. GH4 cells were co-transfected with the Lex6X-CAT reporter plasmid and various LexA-Ets factor fusion proteins and incubated with or without insulin for 24 h (Fig. 1). The LexA fusion constructs of Elk-1 (LexA-Elk-(105/428)) and Sap-1 (LexA-Sap-(90/431)) were insulin responsive. Insulin increased Lex6X-CAT expression 9–10-fold in GH4 cells transfected with LexA fusion proteins containing the C terminus of either Elk-1 or Sap-1 (Fig. 1). EGF also increased Lex6X-CAT expression 8-fold in LexA-Elk-transfected GH4 cells, but no increase in Lex6X-CAT expression was observed in LexA-Sap-transfected cells treated with EGF. The plasmids expressing LexA-GABPα-(1–320), LexA-Elf-(1/195), LexA-Elf-(292/536), and LexA-Ets1-(1/332) were not insulin or EGF responsive (Fig. 1). Finally, a LexA-SRF fusion protein was also tested since Elk and Sap were shown to cooperate with SRF in growth factor and serum stimulation of the c-fos promoter (22Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 27Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). However, neither insulin nor EGF increased Lex6X-CAT expression in the presence of the LexA-SRF fusion protein. Prolactin-CAT expression is insulin sensitive in GH4 and HeLa cells, but not in Rat2 cells. Transcription from the prolactin promoter is increased by cAMP in Rat2 cells. This implies that the lack of insulin responsiveness is not due to a general inactivation of the prolactin promoter in Rat2 cells and suggested that the insulin-sensitive transcription factor might not be present in Rat2 cells. RT-PCR was used to estimate levels of expression of Elk-1 and Sap-1 in the GH4, HeLa, Rat 2, CHO, and 3T3 cells (a positive control) since levels of Elk-1 and Sap-1 were too low to be detected by Western blotting in our cultures. All of the cell lines have measurable, but variable amounts of Sap-1 (Fig.2, bottom). However, Elk-1 was not detectable in lysates from Rat2 cells or CHO cells (Fig. 2,top). Therefore, Rat2 cells were transfected with an expression vector for Elk-1 (MLV-Elk-1) along with the prolactin-CAT reporter, RSV-Pit-1 (to increase transcription from the prolactin promoter), and the insulin receptor. Insulin increased prolactin-CAT expression 4–5-fold in Elk-1 transfected Rat2 cells (Fig.3). This compares to the 8–10-fold increase in prolactin-CAT expression in cAMP-treated GH4 cells. Sap-1, SRF, Ets1, Elf1, and GABP were also expressed under the same conditions to determine if this effect was specific to Elk-1. Insulin did not increase prolactin-CAT expression with any of these transcription factors. Thus, Elk-1 specifically mediated the insulin-increased expression of prolactin-CAT.Figure 3Insulin-increased prolactin-CAT transcription in Rat2 cells expressing Elk-1. Rat2 cells were electroporated with 10 μg of pPrl(−173/+75)CAT (26Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16719-16726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 5 μg of an expression vector for the human insulin receptor, pRT3HIR2 (J. Whittaker), and 2 μg of Rous sarcoma virus-β–galactosidase alone or with 10 μg of a vector expressing a cDNA for the Ets-related transcription factor indicated. After 24 h, the medium was exchanged and 1 μg/ml insulin or 0.1 mm 8-(4-chloreophenylthio)-cAMP was added to the appropriate cultures. The plates were harvested 48 h after electroporation by washing 3 times with normal saline and freezing. The average percent acetylation/10 μg of protein in control and insulin- or cAMP-treated cultures was determined, adjusted for β-galactosidase expression, and the CAT activity from cells incubated with hormones were compared with control levels to determine the fold-stimulation (Fold-Control). The results are from three separate experiments done in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) However, prolactin-CAT expression was not increased in CHO cells (that also lack Elk-1) under the same conditions (see Fig. 5, below). This implied that another transcription factor was required for insulin-increased prolactin-CAT expression in addition to Elk-1 and Pit-1. It was possible that this factor was C/EBPα since C/EBPα binds to the prolactin promoter at a site overlapping the insulin response element (5Jacob K.K. Stanley F.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A physical interaction between Elk-1/Sap-1 and C/EBPα was established by the association of [35S]Elk-1 or [35S]Sap-1 translated in vitro with GST-C/EBPα (Fig. 4, top). Elk-1 (lane 2) binds to C/EBPα with an apparent lower affinity than Sap-1 (lane 5) since an equal number of counts/min of 35S-labeled protein was used in each case. However, binding of SRF (lane 8) used as a control, was not detected.Figure 4In vitro association of Elk-1, Sap-1, and C/EBPα. Top,35S-labeled Elk-1, Sap-1, or SRF were incubated with a GST-C/EBPα fusion protein or with GST that had been purified using GST-agarose (Sigma). The agarose beads were washed extensively and eluted in SDS sample buffer. The labeled proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The input lanes contain 10% of the total35S added in the incubations. Bottom,35S-labeled Elk-1, Sap-1, or SRF were incubated with GST-Elk-(105–350) or Sap-(95–340) fusion proteins or with GST that had been purified using glutathione-agarose. The samples were washed, resolved, and visualized as above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Elk-1 and Sap-1 also interact with each other (Fig. 4,bottom). 35S-Elk-1 and 35S-Sap-1 but not 35S-SRF associate with GST-Elk-(105–350) (Fig. 4,bottom, lanes 2, 6, and 10) and with GST-Sap-(95–340) (Fig. 4, bottom, lanes 3, 7, and11). None of the 35S-labeled proteins associated with the GST control (Fig. 4, bottom, lanes 4, 8, and12). Insulin did not increase prolactin-CAT expression in CHO cells electroporated with Elk-1 and Pit-1 (data not shown). This was unlike the response of Rat2 cells (Fig. 3) and suggested that at least one other transcription factor (in addition to basal factors) was required for insulin-increased prolactin-CAT expression. The interactions between Elk and Sap and C/EBPα suggested that C/EBPα might be the factor that is low or missing in CHO cells. Expression of the prolactin-CAT reporter plasmid was undetectable in CHO cells transfected with either C/EBPα or Pit-1 alone while co-transfection with both Pit-1 and C/EBPα resulted in high level expression from the prolactin promoter. However, insulin treatment had no effect unless Elk-1 was co-transfected with C/EBPα and Pit-1 (Fig.5). Insulin increased prolactin promoter activity was not restored using any of the other Ets-related transcription factors (the <2-fold increase seen in Sap-1 electroporated cultures was not significant). Thus, CHO cells can be transformed into an insulin-sensitive phenotype through co-expression of the transcription factors Elk-1 and C/EBPα. Knockdown experiments could confirm that Elk mediates insulin-increased prolactin gene expression. Twelve different Elk-1 antisense oligonucleotides were designed to the 5′ region of the mouse Elk-1 gene flanking the first ATG. One of these, CATCACTAGGGAAGCACTCACGCCATT, was able to consistently reduce levels of Elk-1 mRNA without affecting C/EBPα, Pit-1, or Sap-1 mRNA. This oligonucleotide was delivered into GH4 by scraping the cells from the dish in the presence of 1 μm antisense oligonucleotide. Pores open in adherent cells when they are scraped from the plastic dish and small molecules in the medium can enter the cell for a short period after scraping (28Partridge M. Vincent A. Matthews P. Puma J. Stein D. Summerton J. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1996; 6: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). GH4 cells were also scraped in the presence of a control antisense oligonucleotide and without any oligonucleotide. The cells were harvested after 24 h and electroporated as described above with the prolactin-CAT reporter plasmid in the presence of 1 μm antisense oligonucleotide. Six wells were set up from each electroporation. Two each for determination of CAT activity in control and insulin-treated cultures and two wells for preparation of mRNA for comparative determination of the level of mRNA for Elk-1 and other transcription factors. The cells were treated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Insulin-increased prolactin-CAT expression is reduced to 40% of control levels by treatment of GH4 cells with the antisense Elk-1 oligonucleotide (Fig.6) while the level of CAT expression in the cells treated with the control antisense oligonucleotide is not significantly different from the control. Antisense oligonucleotides can have many non-antisense effects (29Stein C. Nature Biotech. 1999; 17: 209Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was important to determine the levels of Elk-1 in antisense-treated GH4 cells. Parallel wells were harvested in lysis buffer and mRNA was prepared. RT-PCR was then performed using primers to C/EBPα, Elk-1, Pit-1, and Sap-1. Comparative mRNA levels for control cells and cells treated with antisense Elk and the control antisense oligonucleotide are shown (Fig.7). The antisense oligonucleotide to Elk-1 reduced Elk-1 mRNA levels to 30% of control (Fig. 7), while the control antisense oligonucleotide was without effect. The antisense oligonucleotides did not affect expression of C/EBPα, Sap-1, or Pit-1 mRNA. Fusion proteins containing the C terminus of either Elk-1 or Sap-1 mediated insulin increased prolactin-CAT expression (Figs. 1). These results were specific for Elk-1 and Sap-1 since LexA fusion proteins with other Ets-transcription factors, Elf-1, Ets-1, and GABPα (Fig. 1) did not mediate this response. This suggested that either Elk-1 or Sap-1 could mediate insulin-responsive gene transcription. Insulin-increased prolactin gene transcription is not observed in Rat-2 and CHO cells. The Rat-2 and CHO cells have endogenous Sap-1, but Elk-1 was not detectable in these cell lines. The expression of Elk-1 in Rat-2 and CHO cells, along with transcription factors necessary for establishing basal transcription of the prolactin gene, converts them into an insulin-sensitive phenotype. Finally, Elk-1 knockdown in GH4 cells reduced insulin-increased prolactin-CAT expression commensurate with reduced Elk-1 expression. These studies establish that Elk-1 is necessary for insulin-increased prolactin gene expression. Sap-1 alone is not able to mediate insulin-responsive gene transcription since Rat2 and CHO cells expressed Sap-1 (Fig. 2) and yet were not insulin responsive (Figs. 3 and 5). This was surprising since either Elk-1 or Sap-1 could function independently in the activation of the serum response element of the c-fos promoter (22Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 23Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 76: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (534) Google Scholar,27Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 30Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). It is possible that Sap-1 levels in Rat-2 and CHO cells were below some threshold necessary to mediate insulin responses. However, this appears unlikely as insulin-increased prolactin-CAT expression was not observed in Rat-2 or CHO cells even when Sap-1 was exogenously expressed (Figs. 3 and 5). Thus, the role of Sap-1 in insulin-increased prolactin gene expression remains unclear. Sap-1 might play no role in insulin-increased transcription. Alternatively, it is possible that Elk-1/Sap-1 heterodimerization might be required for insulin-increased transcription. The interaction between Elk-1 and Sap-1 in the GST pull-down experiments suggested that Elk-1 and Sap-1 might heterodimerize in vivo to mediate effects on gene transcription. Elk-1 and Sap-1 were not known to form dimers in solution, but the phosphorylation dependent formation of a dimer on the c-Fos serum response element was reported (31Gille H. Kortenhann M. Strahl T. Shaw P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since the c-Fos serum response element has only a single, weak Ets-response element, this is likely a protein-protein interaction. The GST pull-down experiments (Fig. 4) demonstrated physical association between Elk-1/Elk-1, Elk-1/Sap-1, and Sap-1/Sap-1. The associations observed in our GST pull-down experiments are clearly independent of phosphorylation. The prolactin promoter has two Ets-response sequences. The CGGAAA sequence at −96/−92 is the strongest while an AGGA sequence is at −76/−73. Thus, it appears likely that two Ets-related transcription factors can bind simultaneously to the prolactin promoter. Protein-protein interactions may stabilize this interaction and select for the heterodimer over the monomer. However, it has not yet proved possible to knockdown Sap-1 in GH4 cells. The use of antisense oligonucleotides designed against the sequence of human Sap-1 was unsuccessful. This is likely due to a substantial difference in the non-coding region of the Sap-1 gene from human and mouse. The sequences of the human Elk-1 and the mouse Elk-1 differ greatly in the 5′-untranslated region and the same is likely to be true of Sap-1. However, the sequence of the mouse and/or rat Sap-1 gene is unknown. Finally, no Sap-1 minus cell line has been identified. Insulin does not increase prolactin-CAT expression in CHO cells that transiently express Elk-1 (data not shown) although insulin-increased Lex6X-CAT transcription is observed in CHO cells expressing LexA-Elk-1 fusion proteins (data not shown). This suggested that the insulin-signaling pathway was intact in CHO cells but that some other transcription factor required for insulin-sensitive prolactin-CAT expression was not expressed. The observation that C/EBPα was a physiological regulator of prolactin gene expression whose binding site overlaps the insulin response element (5Jacob K.K. Stanley F.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that C/EBPα might be this required factor. C/EBPα associates with Elk-1/Sap-1 in vitro as indicated by association in GST pull-down assays (Fig. 4). However, the physiological significance of this observation is presently unclear. The C/EBPα binding element of the prolactin promoter is weak compared with the consensus C/EBP-response element. Thus, it is possible that interaction with Elk-1/Sap-1 stabilizes the weak association with the prolactin DNA. This seem unlikely since deletion of the Ets-binding element did not reduce basal prolactin gene expression as would be expected if this also weakened the association of C/EBPα with the prolactin promoter (3Jacob K.K. Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25515-25520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of C/EBPα along with Pit-1 and Elk-1 in CHO cells converted CHO cells to an insulin responsive phenotype. Previous experiments showed that insulin-increased prolactin-CAT expression was inhibited by expression of Chop 10/Gad 53. This factor binds to C/EBPα and inactivates it. Thus, both knock-in and knock-down experiments now establish that C/EBPα is an accessory factor required for insulin-increased prolactin-CAT expression. Several reports have suggested that C/EBP family members can mediate effects of cAMP (32Roesler W. Park E. McFie P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14950-14957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Park E. Song S. Vinson C. Roesler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 211-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is possible that C/EBPα may mediate cAMP-increased prolactin gene expression since mutation of the C/EBP response element eliminates cAMP responsiveness. However, C/EBPα expression in CHO cells does not make the prolactin promoter cAMP responsive in those cells. This could be due to failure of cAMP signaling pathways to link to C/EBP in CHO cells or to lack of a co-regulator recruited by C/EBPα. Finally, the cAMP response might be mediated by another factor that associates in the complex of transcription factors that bind to this element. It remains to be determined how the factors that interact in the promoter region of the prolactin gene increase transcription in response to insulin. The carboxyl terminus of Elk-1 contains numerous phosphorylation sites and experiments with LexA-Elk-1 fusion proteins indicated that this region of Elk-1 is essential for insulin-increased LexA-CAT expression mediated by these fusion proteins. 3A. Vulin, K. K. Jacob, and F. M. Stanley, manuscript in preparation. This modification of Elk-1 might be required to recruit a co-activator complex to the promoter. It was reported that Elk-1 can recruit CBP to the Fos promoter (34Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, experiments using expression of E1a mutants did not support a role for CBP in prolactin promoter activation by insulin. 4A. Vulin and F. M. Stanley, unpublished data. Alternatively, phosphorylated Elk-1 might interact with the basal transcription factors such as TFIIB to stabilize the initiation complex. Further research will attempt to further define how insulin-modified Elk-1 activates transcription. We thank D. Ron, J. Leiden, R. Maurer, S. L. McKnight, C. C. Thompson, R. Treisman, and J.

Recent crystallographic analysis revealed that dimerization is coupled with key changes at the ligand binding site with the distal histidine sterically restricting ligand binding in the deoxy dimer but with no significant structural rearrangements on the proximal side.

Here we present the 2.9-Å crystal structure of deoxygenated lamprey hemoglobin in an orthorhombic crystal form along with the structure of these crystals exposed to carbon monoxide. The hexameric assemblage in this crystal form is very similar to those observed in the previous deoxy structure. Whereas the hydrogen bonding network and packing contacts formed in the dimeric interface of lamprey hemoglobin are largely unaffected by ligand binding, the binding of carbon monoxide induces the distal histidine to swing to positions that would preclude the formation of a stabilizing hydrogen bond with the bound ligand.

In human hemoglobin, the binding and release of the ligand is associated with large quaternary structural changes in the tetrameric assemblage (1Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Luisi B. Shaanan B. Liddington R.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1987; 20: 309-321Crossref Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In the homodimeric hemoglobin from the blood clamScapharca, there is only a small change in quaternary structure with larger changes at the tertiary structural level upon ligand binding (2Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A very different allosteric mechanism is operative in the hemoglobins of the primitive sea lamprey in which ligation induces subunit dissociation. Efficient oxygen binding results from the coupling of proton binding with the equilibrium between low affinity oligomers and higher affinity monomers (3Riggs A. Hardisty M.W. Potter I.C. The Biology of Lampreys. Academic Press, Inc., London, UK1972: 261-286Google Scholar). The lamprey hemoglobin assemblage has been extensively studied to further our understanding of the nature of cooperative oxygen binding by hemoglobins. Recent crystallographic analysis of the deoxygenated dimeric form of lamprey hemoglobin (4Heaslet H.A. Royer W.E. Structure. 1999; 7: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) suggested a structural basis for its lowered oxygen affinity and the unusually large Bohr effect (5Wald G. Riggs A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1951; 35: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the deoxy dimer indicated that the Bohr effect was the result of formation of a pair of hydrogen bonds among glutamic acid residues across the subunit interface. A comparison of the deoxy dimer with the monomeric cyanide derivative (6Honzatko R.B. Hendrickson W.A. Love W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 147-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) demonstrated significant structural rearrangements near the ligand binding site (distal pocket). Dimerization is coupled with a movement of the distal histidine toward the heme iron, sterically restricting ligand binding. In contrast, there were no major structural changes on the opposite (proximal) side of the heme group. These results lead to the hypothesis that oxygen affinity in lamprey hemoglobin primarily is regulated distally (4Heaslet H.A. Royer W.E. Structure. 1999; 7: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The distal regulation of oxygen affinity in lamprey hemoglobin is far different from that believed to be operative in other cooperative hemoglobins such as human hemoglobin (1Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Luisi B. Shaanan B. Liddington R.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1987; 20: 309-321Crossref Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 7Barrick D. Ho N.T. Simplaceanu V. Dahlquist F.W. Ho C. Nat. Struct.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13171-13179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) in which proximal effects appear to play a central role. Examining ligand-linked structural transitions within crystals grown anaerobically in an oligomeric state permits the visualization of the stereochemistry of the low affinity binding mode. Among several different crystal forms of lamprey hemoglobin, the orthorhombic A-type crystals have been shown to be amenable for ligand transition experiments (9Hendrickson W.A. Love W.E. Murray G.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 829-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The binding of carbon monoxide (CO)1 to A-type crystals results in significant changes in diffraction intensities and, under certain solvent conditions, changes in cell axis lengths. In this paper, we present the crystal structure of deoxy lamprey hemoglobin in A-type crystals along with its structure when exposed to CO. The comparison of the CO-bound structure with that of the deoxy structure revealed transitions that suggest a dual role for the distal histidine in regulating oxygen affinity and strongly support the hypothesis that oxygen affinity is distally regulated. In contrast to rearrangements seen at the distal side of the heme group, no significant structural changes were observed at the proximal side or at the subunit interface upon CO binding. Lampreys were collected from the Connecticut River in Holyoke, MA during their spring spawning migration and transported to our laboratory. They were sacrificed by decapitation, and their whole blood was collected in beakers coated with 0.25m tripotassium citrate/50 mm EDTA and saturated with CO. The whole blood was washed three times with 150 mmNaCl by centrifugation at 4000 g to isolate the red blood cells and subsequently was stored as packed red cells at −80 °C. The frozen erythrocytes were thawed and resuspended in a 2-fold excess of 60 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The solution was centrifuged at 17,000 g for 20 min to pellet any debris and subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation at 4 °C. The precipitate at 35% saturation in ammonium sulfate, which contained little or no hemoglobin, was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 g. The supernatant was increased to 80% saturated ammonium sulfate to precipitate the hemoglobin and centrifuged at 12,000 g. The precipitated hemoglobin was resuspended in a minimum amount of 60 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, resaturated with CO, centrifuged at 14,500 g to pellet any precipitant or denatured hemoglobin, and dialyzed at 4 °C in a 100-fold excess volume of distilled water. The dialyzed hemoglobin was concentrated by centrifugation in centripreps (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) at 1000g to a concentration of ∼50 mg/ml. The components of the hemoglobin mixture were separated using a flatbed isoelectric focusing apparatus (FBE-3000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The major component (V) with an isoelectric point of 5.8 was isolated. The hemoglobin V was removed from the IEF-Sephadex gel by filtration through glass wool using 170 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The separated hemoglobin V was then reconcentrated by centrifugation in centricons (Amicon, Inc.) at 1500 g to a concentration of 40–70 mg/ml. The hemoglobin was oxidized to the (+3) ferric form by adding a 1.1-fold molar excess of potassium ferricyanide. The solution was then transferred into an anaerobic chamber (Bactron model, Anaerobic Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA). Once in the anaerobic environment, the hemoglobin was reduced to the (+2) ferrous state by the addition of a few grains of sodium hydrosulfite. Crystals were grown by batch method in the anaerobic chamber in 25% polyethylene glycol 4000 buffered in 170 mmphosphate buffer at pH 6.8. Crystals were mounted in thin-walled glass capillaries (Charles Supper Co., Natick, MA) in the anaerobic chamber and sealed with epoxy (Hardman, Inc., Bellevelle, NJ). Once out of the deoxygenated environment, the capillaries were permanently sealed with Cenco deKhotinsky cement (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ). Crystals were exposed to carbon monoxide by opening the sealed capillaries with a hot wire and flushing with carbon monoxide that had been bubbled through a 50% polyethylene glycol 4000 solution buffered in 170 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. After ∼2 min of flushing, the color of the deoxy crystals changed from deep purple to bright red, suggesting the successful binding of carbon monoxide. Flushing continued for 5 min, after which the capillary was resealed with epoxy (Hardman, Inc.). X-ray diffraction patterns from one deoxy crystal were collected on an R-Axis IV imaging plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator (Molecular Structure, The Woodlands, TX).

Data collection statistics are provided in Table I. The deoxy structure was determined by molecular replacement using the 2.7-Å deoxy dimer structure (4Heaslet H.A. Royer W.E. Structure. 1999; 7: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as a search molecule in the program AMoRe (11Collaborative Computing Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr.

Rotation and translation searches indicated the presence of three dimers per asymmetric unit with correlation coefficients of 17.5–24.3% for each individual solution. A combination of these three solutions resulted in a correlation coefficient of 54.5% andR-factor of 41.3%. Rigid body refinement of the three dimers improved the correlation coefficient to 62.8% andR-factor to 37.1%. The initial model for the deoxy structure was refined using the program CNS (13Brünger A.T. Adams P. Clore M. Gros P. Nilges M. Read R. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). 10% of randomly selected reflections were designated as test reflections for use in the Free-R cross validation method and used throughout the refinement (14Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 471-475Crossref Scopus (3839) Google Scholar). Simulated annealing, Powell minimization and group B-factor refinements were performed incorporating tight non-crystallographic symmetry restraints (weight − ncs = 300). 12 water positions were identified using CNS (13Brünger A.T. Adams P. Clore M. Gros P. Nilges M. Read R. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). The intermediate structures were fitted in the molecular visualization program O (15Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

The binding of the ligand in the CO-exposed crystals was confirmed by difference Fourier (F CO −F deoxy) maps showing large positive peaks at the ligand binding sites (Fig. 1 A). The CO-ligated dimer structure was refined with the program CNS (13Brünger A.T. Adams P. Clore M. Gros P. Nilges M. Read R. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

Nature. 1992; 355: 471-475Crossref Scopus (3839) Google Scholar). Simulated annealing, Powell minimization, group B-factor, and group occupancy refinements were performed incorporating tight non-crystallographic symmetry restraints (weight − ncs = 200) for the protein (excluding the distal histidine (His-73)). The intermediate structures were fitted in the molecular visualization program O (15Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) using F 0 − F c, 2F 0 − F c, and 6-fold averaged 2F 0 − F c maps (16Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Bailey S. Hubbard R. Waller D.A.

An examination of F 0 − F c, 2F 0 − F c, and simulated annealing omit maps clearly indicated the presence of alternate conformers for His-73. Alternate conformers were modeled into the 2F 0 − F cdensity around His-73 using the visualization program O (15Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Satisfactory modeling required only rotation about the Cα-Cβ and Cβ-Cγbonds among different conformers. The alternate conformations for His-73 were then refined using the program CNS (13Brünger A.T. Adams P. Clore M. Gros P. Nilges M. Read R. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). The crystals of deoxy lamprey hemoglobin V used in this study show the symmetry of the orthorhombic space group P212121. These A-type crystals had been reported previously to contain eight protomers per asymmetric unit (9Hendrickson W.A. Love W.E. Murray G.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 829-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the results of the molecular replacement calculations using the program AMoRe, (11Collaborative Computing Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar, 12Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) clearly indicated the presence of only six protomers. CO binding to the A-type crystals examined here alters the cell constants only slightly (Table I). Successful CO binding was immediately evident from a difference Fourier (F o − F o) map between the CO-exposed crystals and the deoxy crystals (Fig.1 A). The deoxy structure has been refined at 2.9-Å resolution to anR-factor of 19.2% (Free R = 23.4%) using group B-factors and non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. The CO-ligated structure has been refined at 2.9-Å resolution to anR-factor of 23.0% (Free R = 25.4%) using group B-factors and non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. The data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table I. A Ramachandran plot shows no residues in disallowed regions, 93.3% in most favored regions for the deoxy structure, and 92.5% in most favored regions for the CO-ligated structure (17Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The dimeric interface formed between the subunits of deoxy lamprey hemoglobin in the A-type orthorhombic crystals is essentially identical to that formed in the monoclinic (P21) crystals previously characterized (Fig.2). The interface is formed with the contacting regions among E-helices in adjacent subunits and between the E-helix of one subunit and the A/B corner of the adjacent subunit. The hydrogen-bonding network (Fig. 3) and packing contacts (Fig. 2) found in the dimeric interface are nearly identical in the two crystal forms.Figure 3Stereoview of the hydrogen-bonding network formed in the dimeric interface of deoxy lamprey hemoglobin V viewed along the 2-fold axis of symmetry. The first three turns of the E-helix are shown in light blue, whereas the A/B corner is shown in blue. The heme groups are shown inblack. Plausible hydrogen bonds (dashed lines) are formed between residues in the E-helix of one subunit and residues in the A/B corner of the adjacent subunit in a manner similar to a shoelace. Shown is the carbonyl oxygen of Ser-28 (not labeled), the side chain of Tyr-30 (Y30 and Y30′), the side chain of Glu-31 (E31 and E31′), the side chain of Arg-71 (R71 and R71′), the side chain of His-73 (H73 and H73′), and the side chain of Glu-75 (E75 and E75′).

Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The buried surface area in the deoxy monoclinic crystals was reported to be 478 ± 15 Å2/subunit (4Heaslet H.A. Royer W.E. Structure. 1999; 7: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The surface area buried in the dimeric interface of lamprey hemoglobin is calculated to be 482 ± 13 Å2 in the deoxy orthorhombic crystals and 483 ± 11 Å2 in the CO-ligated orthorhombic crystals, virtually identical to surface area buried in the dimeric interface of lamprey hemoglobin from the previous analysis. The contributions of individual residues to the surface area buried in the dimeric interface of lamprey hemoglobin in the monoclinic crystals closely resembles those found here with Trp-72 contributing the largest share. The six unique dimers in the monoclinic crystals formed two essentially indistinguishable hexamers arranged as one turn of an approximately 3-fold screw axis (4Heaslet H.A. Royer W.E. Structure. 1999; 7: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A nearly identical hexameric assemblage is also observed in the deoxy orthorhombic crystals. This suggests that the hexameric assemblages observed in the two crystal types might represent a structure formed in deoxy erythrocytes in vivo. The binding of carbon monoxide to deoxy A-type crystals of lamprey hemoglobin occurs in the absence of subunit dissociation that would occur under protein concentrations used in solution measurements. Apparently, the molecular interactions in the high concentration of the crystal lattice are sufficient to maintain the dimeric contacts upon CO binding. Difference maps (F CO −F deoxy) (Fig. 1 A) directly reveal structural transitions localized in the distal pocket with no significant differences observed on the proximal side. The major effect of CO binding is a movement of the distal histidine (His-73) away from the ligand binding site. This is required because the Nε of His-73 in the deoxy state is about 1.5 Å from the oxygen atom position and 2.4 Å from the carbon atom position of the CO ligand, blocking access to the heme iron. As is apparent from the electron density maps (Fig. 1, B andC), His-73 exhibits significant conformational flexibility following CO binding to lamprey hemoglobin dimers. In contrast, His-73 is well ordered in the structures of deoxy dimers and cyano-met monomer of lamprey hemoglobin. To account for the observed conformational flexibility, two alternate conformations were refined for each of the six monomers in the asymmetric unit. The 12 refined conformations ranged in position from being near the ligand, with the Nε of His-73 as close as 2.8 Å to the oxygen atom of bound ligand (O), to swinging well away from the ligand with this Nε to O distance as high as 7.2 Å. Most subunits were refined with one conformation relatively close to the ligand and one far removed. Even with His-73 in its closest approach to the ligand, the Nε of His-73 would be unable to form a strong stabilizing hydrogen bond with a bound oxygen as the best possible Nε-Hε-O angle would be about 120°. In sharp contrast with the monomer structure (6Honzatko R.B. Hendrickson W.A. Love W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 147-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the position of the E-helix in the dimeric form prevents His-73 from attaining a conformation that could form a strong hydrogen bond with a bound oxygen (Figs.4 and5). The 12 conformations of His-73 modeled in the CO-ligated structure differ by rotation around the Cα-Cβ and Cβ-Cγ bonds (Fig. 4 B). Although the resolution limit of our analysis precludes precise modeling of the alternate conformers for His-73, a comparison of the six subunits per asymmetric unit clearly indicates the mobility of this residue. Most importantly, in an intact dimer, His-73 cannot be oriented in a position that would permit optimal hydrogen bonding with bound oxygen.Figure 5Stereodiagram showing E/F helical superposition of lamprey hemoglobin in the cyano-met (cyan), deoxy (blue), and CO-ligated (purple) forms. Main-chain α-carbons of the three forms were superimposed with the exception of residues in the E-helices. Shown are backbone worms from residues 69 to 109. The side chains for His-73 (Distal His) and His-105 (Proximal His) are shown for the three forms. Only the most highly populated distal His position for the CO structure is shown. The heme groups for all three forms are shown with CO ligand, omitting the propionates for clarity. Note the disposition of the E-helix toward the ligand binding site in dimeric (deoxy and CO-ligated) forms. As a result, the distal histidine in the deoxy form sterically hinders binding, whereas in the dimeric CO form it moves away from the ligand but to a position that would preclude favorable hydrogen bond formation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The goal of these studies is to provide a structural foundation for understanding the functional regulation of ligand affinity in lamprey hemoglobin. With the results presented here, structures are now available for three alternate forms of lamprey hemoglobin. These include a high affinity ligated monomer (CN-met (6Honzatko R.B. Hendrickson W.A. Love W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 147-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)), two structures of the unligated low affinity dimer, and the structure of a CO-ligated low affinity dimer. A comparison of these three forms provides plausible structural explanations for the observed functional properties. Equilibrium and kinetic measurements of ligand binding along with ultracentrifugation experiments have shown that modulation of oxygen affinity results from the equilibrium between low affinity oligomers, stabilized by proton binding, and higher affinity monomers, stabilized by oxygen binding (18Briehl R.W.

Sugita Y. Yoneyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2354-2363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, ligand affinity is sharply dependent upon pH and protein concentration. The oxygen affinity of the monomeric state, estimated from measurements at a low concentration and higher pH, corresponds to a p50 of ∼5 torr for adult lamprey hemoglobins (19Andersen M.E. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4790-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dohi Y. Sugita Y. Yoneyama Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13517-13528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This indicates that lamprey hemoglobin has rather low oxygen affinity even in the monomeric form. This relatively low affinity of the monomer has been suggested to result from a suboptimal orientation of the proximal histidine relative to the heme with a possible contribution from tight packing of residues in the distal pocket (6Honzatko R.B. Hendrickson W.A. Love W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 147-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). At a higher concentration and low pH from which a much higher fraction will be oligomeric, very low oxygen affinities are observed with p50 values reported as high as 68 torr for hemoglobin from Petromyzon marinus (5Wald G. Riggs A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1951; 35: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and 350 torr for hemoglobin from a related lamprey, Entosphenus japonicus (20Dohi Y. Sugita Y. Yoneyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2354-2363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A comparison of the four known lamprey hemoglobin structures indicate that the difference in affinity between monomeric and oligomeric forms result from alterations in the distal pocket that occur upon dimerization. Each E-helix moves by ∼1 Å toward the ligand binding distal pocket upon dimerization, and the distal histidine crowds an already tight pocket, such that it sterically restricts access to the ligand binding site of the deoxy dimer. This restricted distal pocket provides an explanation for the very low oxygen (0.25 × 106m−1 sec−1) and CO (0.12 × 106m−1 sec−1) combination rate constants in the dimer (19Andersen M.E. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4790-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) among the lowest known combination rate constants for any hemoglobin. Dissociation into monomers results in a 40-fold increase in oxygen and 8-fold increase in CO combination rate constants. Structural comparisons indicate that dissociation results from the movement of the E-helix and His-73 away from the ligand binding site, permitting a more optimal stereochemistry for ligand binding. There is also evidence that oxygen dissociation rate constants are somewhat higher at a lower pH, although a firm estimate of the dissociation rate constant for a dimer has not been obtained (19Andersen M.E. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4790-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our structure of a CO-ligated dimer provides a rationale for these results as His-73 would be unable to form a stabilizing hydrogen bond with bound oxygen in the lamprey hemoglobin dimer but would be able to stabilize bound oxygen in the monomeric form. A comparison of the crystal structures of lamprey hemoglobin indicates that the key residue involved in regulating oxygen affinity in lamprey hemoglobin is His-73. By linking its conformation to oligomeric state, His-73 appears to play a dual role in modulating affinity between monomeric and dimeric forms. In the unligated dimer, its steric restriction of ligand access to the heme binding site acts to lower combination rates and thus oxygen affinity. In addition, the ability of His-73 to form a stabilizing hydrogen bond with bound oxygen in the monomer but not the dimer will enhance the affinity of the monomer relative to that of the dimer. Another residue previously suggested to be involved in the low affinity binding of the deoxy state was Ile-77 (4Heaslet H.A. Royer W.E. Structure. 1999; 7: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Upon CO binding to the dimer, this side chain can adopt the conformation observed in the monomeric form of lamprey hemoglobin, suggesting it is less important in the distal regulation of oxygen affinity (Fig. 4 A). The conformational flexibility that we observe for the distal histidine in these crystals is reminiscent of observed motions in mammalian myoglobins. In sperm whale myoglobin, the distal histidine has been shown to swing out of the distal pocket at pH 4.0, opening a direct channel from the solvent to ligand binding site (22Yang F. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 762-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Additionally, the time-averaged crystallographic refinement of a myoglobin mutant (F46V) indicates that the distal histidine undergoes a swinging motion between the heme pocket and solvent (23Romo T.D. Clarage J.B. Sorensen D.C. Phillips Jr., G.N. Proteins. 1995; 22: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recent near-atomic resolution structures of myoglobin also provide evidence of such distal histidine motion (24Vojtechovsky J. Chu K. Berendzen J. Sweet R.M. Schlichting I. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2153-2174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 25Kachalova G.S. Popov A.N. Bartunik H.D. Science. 1999; 284: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). These observed distal histidine movements represent a functionally important motion suggested to provide a kinetic pathway for ligand to travel into and out of the distal pocket (26Scott E.E. Gibson Q.H. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5177-5188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the stretching frequency of CO bound to myoglobin is very dependent on the environment of the CO, particularly the position of the distal histidine (27Li T. Quillin M.L. Phillips G.N. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This suggests that performing infrared spectra measurements on an assembled form of lamprey hemoglobin could test the multiple conformations of the distal histidine that we observe in these crystals upon CO-binding. As discussed above, a comparison of the four crystal structures of lamprey hemoglobin reveal key structural differences in the distal (ligand binding) pocket that provide plausible structural explanations for the observed functional differences between monomeric and dimeric forms. In contrast, there are no significant changes in the proximal region upon dimerization or upon binding of CO in the oligomeric state at the resolution of our analysis. These observations indicate that oxygen affinity in lamprey hemoglobin is distally regulated with His-73 playing key roles in the differences in ligand binding properties between the dimer and monomer forms. The distal control of ligand affinity in lamprey hemoglobin contrasts with other cooperative hemoglobins. For instance, in the homodimeric hemoglobin (HbI) from the blood clam Scapharca, the movement of the heme iron into the heme plane is restricted by the packing of Phe-97 against the proximal side of the heme (Fig.6, top panel) (2Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). When ligand binds, the side chain of Phe-97 is displaced from the heme pocket, allowing the proximal histidine to move toward the heme group and the heme iron to move into the heme plane. The changes at the distal side of HbI are small compared with to those observed in the proximal pocket. In contrast, lamprey hemoglobin V dimerization exhibits a more direct effect on the ligand binding site. There is a close coupling between the conformation of His-73 and that of Trp-72 from which side-chain conformation undergoes major rearrangement as it is buried in the dimer interface (Fig. 6, bottom panel). Our present work, in which deoxy crystals of lamprey hemoglobin are exposed to carbon monoxide, shows significant structural rearrangements at the distal side of the heme with no observable changes at the proximal side (Figs. 4 and 5). This work strongly supports the hypothesis that the oxygen affinity in lamprey hemoglobin is distally regulated. An important test of the proposed structural mechanism for regulation of lamprey hemoglobin has been mutagenesis carried out by Qui et al. (21Qiu Y. Maillett D.H. Knapp J. Olson J.S. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13517-13528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Nine mutants were expressed and subjected to sedimentation equilibrium and oxygen binding experiments to probe the role of individual residues in the assembly and regulation of oxygen affinity. The mutation of key residues at the dimeric interface, namely Tyr-30, Glu-31, Glu-75, and Asn-79, either decreased the stability of lamprey hemoglobin dimers or completely abolished dimerization. Consistent with the lower oxygen affinity of the dimer (18Briehl R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2361-2366Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), the dimer destabilizing mutants also showed higher oxygen affinity. Mutation of the distal His to Gln resulted in significantly increased oxygen affinity unlike the decreased affinity in the equivalent mutation in mammalian myoglobins and hemoglobins along with a decrease in dimer stability. Thus, the effects of this mutation could result from a combination of a removal of steric effects at the ligand binding site and disruption of the interface. It is also interesting to note that the mutation of Glu-75 to Gln decreased the number of protons released/heme by half, relative to the wild type and consistent with the involvement of this residue in the Bohr effect suggested by our structural results. Thus, these results strongly support the mechanism proposed earlier (4Heaslet H.A. Royer W.E. Structure. 1999; 7: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and extended here. These studies provide a structural basis for understanding an exquisite interface design that balances favorable and unfavorable interactions, such that binding of protons or oxygen can drive oligomerization or subunit dissociation.
