https://openalex.org/W1995417879,"Even granting our uncertainties about parts of our model of the sulfur cycle, we can draw some conclusions from it: 1) Man is now contributing about one half as much as nature to the total atmospheric burden of sulfur compounds, but by A.D. 2000 he will be contributing about as much, and in the Northern Hemisphere alone he will be more than matching nature. 2) In industrialized regions he is overwhelming natural processes, and the removal processes are slow enough (several days, at least) so that the increased concentration is marked for hundreds to thousands of kilometers downwind. 3) Our main areas of uncertainty, and ones that demand immediate attention because of their importance to the regional air pollution question, are: (i) the rates of conversion of H(2)S and SO(2) to sulfate particles in polluted as well as unpolluted atmospheres; (ii) the efficiency of removal of sulfur compounds by precipitation in polluted air. And for a better understanding of the global model we need to know: (i) the amount of biogenic H(2)S that enters the atmosphere over the continents and coastal areas; (ii) means of distinguishing man-made and biogenic contributions to excess sulfate in air and precipitation; (iii) the volcanic production of sulfur compounds, and their influence on the particle concentration in the stratosphere; (iv) the large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns that exchange air between stratosphere and troposphere (although absolute amounts of sulfate particles involved are small relative to the lower tropospheric burden); (v) the role of the oceans as sources or sinks for SO(2)."
https://openalex.org/W2004641590,"A peculiar distribution of esophageal cancer was observed in the Caspian littoral of Iran, where an ad hoc cancer registry has been in operation since 1968. A very high incidence, among the hghest recorded in the world, with a higher incidence in women than in men (male: 108.8 cases per 100,000 population; female: 174.1 per 100,000), was recorded in the northeastern corner of the region; this sparsely populated, semidesert area of the central Asian type, with predominantly saline soils, was settled by Turkomans. A lower incidence with a change in the male-to-female ratio was observed in the southeastern and central parts of the region, which are located in the piedmont area of the Elburz Mountains; these areas have more abundant rainfall and nonsaline soils, and are densely populated by Iranians. A steady decline in the incidence with an increase in the preponderance of male cases was observed toward the west, reaching the lowest figures (male: 17.2 cases per 100,000 population; female: 5.5 per 100,000) in the Caspian rain belt, with its heavily leached soils and somewhat subtropical characteristcs. Changes in the natural vegetation and in the agricultural practices parallel the changing features of the climate. A multidisciplinary, multidisease, and multifactorial study is in preparation. By plotting the detailed physical, biotic, and cultural characteristics of the selected ecological regions on the intrinsic characteristics of the population groups experiencing different esophageal cancer risk, new and profitable working hypotheses as to the etiology of esophageal cancer might be produced."
https://openalex.org/W2067159021,"The quantitative analyses and other applications described in this article indicate a useful future for the ionmicroprobe mass analyzer in many areas of the science of solid materials. It should be possible to analyze all the elements quantitatively, but detection sensitivities will vary depending on the matrix, the element, and the polarity of the sputtered ion being studied. Most elements will have optimum yields in the spectrum of positive sputtered ions, and will be detected in concentrations of parts per million in micrometer-sized sampling areas. Electronegative elements will be detected with similar sensitivities in the spectrum of negative sputtered ions, but inert gases, which are ionized with difficulty and have small electron affinities, will be detected with considerably poorer sensitivities. In general, it will be possible to measure isotope ratios without chemical separation of the constituent elemrents of the sample. The precision of an ion microprobe isotope ratio measurement depends basically on the counting rates involved, and its accuracy can approach its precision if auxiliary standards are used. The isotope ratios of different elements can be compared readily because of the small mass-discrimination effects of the system. Surface layers can be quantitatively analyzed in depth with a resolution of tens of angstroms; hence, it should be possible to study the migration of atoms."

The isolation was confirmed by recording no surround effect at bipolar cells under conditions that elicited a strong surround effect at ganglion cells. It appears that amacrine cell, which respond to spatiotemporal change at one retinal region, inhibit the response to change in on-off ganglion cells at adjacent sites."
https://openalex.org/W2081474179,A South American anuran (Phyllomedusa sauvagii) produced large amounts of semisolid urate when it was maintained on a diet of insects. Rates of evaporative water loss in Phyllomedusa sauvagii were only about 5 to 10 percent of those other anurans tested and were similar to those of lizards of comparable size.
https://openalex.org/W2029852505,"A technique obtaining a precise mapping of interactive effects in the pitch memory store is described. Subjects were required to compare two tones for pitch when these were separated by a 5-second interval during which six other tones were played. In the second serial position of the intervening sequence there was placed a tone whose pitch bore a critical relationship to the pitch of the first test tone. When the critical intervening tone was identical in pitch to the first test tone, memory facilitation was produced. As the separation in pitch between these two tones increased, errors rose progressively, peaked at a separation of 2/3 tone, and declined roughly to baseline at a whole tone separation. It is concluded that the pitch memory store is arranged logarithmically in a highly ordered and specific fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2084330808,"A transition metal compound that is bound in tissues by any appropriate cytochemical reaction may catalyze the generation of an insoluble osmiophilic polymer from organic monomers such as 3,3'-diaminobenzidine. When the polymers are treated with osmium tetroxide, electron-opaque, insoluble osmium blacks (coordination polymers of osmium) are formed at the sites of the particular macromolecule or enzyme permitting its light, and electron, microscopic localization. This approach represents a distinct advantage over earlier cytochemical methods because the shorter incubation time needed here results in less artifactual deposition of metal ions, and less tendency to crystallize the reaction product. In addition, the shorter incubation times permit longer fixation of tissues and hence less artifact due to enzyme diffusion."
https://openalex.org/W2036578554,Uranium concentrations in North American rivers are higher than those reported 20 years ago. The increase is attributed to applications to agricultural land of larger amounts of phosphate fertilizer containing appreciable concentrations of uranium. Experiments showing a constant phosphorous-uranium ratio for various types of fertilizers and for the easily solubilized fraction of 0-46-0 fertilizers support this view.

https://openalex.org/W2072136636,"The distribution of H-2 isoantigens on the plasma membrane of lymphocytes and thymocytes was studied with ferritin-conjugated alloantibody. The spatial arrangement of the membrane components which possess H-2 isoantigens is markedly altered by the attachment of a second antibody, directed toward mouse gamma globulin or ferritin; the second antibody appears to cause the aggregation of the sensitized H-2 antigens into discrete zones on the cell membrane. Other membrane antigens may be equally affected by indirect labeling techniques and, thus, topographic analysis of the antigenic structure should be done with antibody that is directly conjugated."
https://openalex.org/W1584310946,"Abstract Human phosphoglycerate kinase (ATP:3-phospho-d-glycerate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.2.3) was purified from red blood cells. The stepwise procedures are elimination of hemoglobin from the hemolysate by treatment with ethanol-chloroform, precipitation of the enzyme by ethanol, treatment with carboxymethyl-Sephadex, gel filtration on Sephadex G-75, treatment with diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex, and column chromatography with carboxymethyl-Sephadex. A crystalline preparation was obtained with an over-all yield of about 60%. The sedimentation patterns on analytical ultracentrifugation and the interference pattern of sedimentation equilibrium indicated a homogeneous preparation. The sedimentation constant (s20,w) was 3.35 S at a protein concentration of 0.6%. The molecular weight was estimated as 49,600 by the sedimentation equilibrium method. The enzyme could not be dissociated into smaller subunits by treatment with 5 m guanidine hydrochloride containing 2-mercaptoethanol, with maleic anhydride, or with sodium dodecylsulfate. The enzyme has N-acetylserine as NH2terminal and isoleucine as COOH-terminal. The specific activity of the crystalline preparation was 650 to 700 units per mg at pH 7.5 and at 25°. The enzyme required Mg2+ or Mn2+ for activity."
https://openalex.org/W1558610361,"Abstract The catalytic properties of two purified rabbit liver tRNA nucleotidyltransferases were examined and compared. Both enzymes incorporated AMP, CMP, and UMP into tRNA, but were inactive with GTP or dATP. The pH optima for the various nucleotides and for both enzymes were similar and were in the range of pH 9 to 10. Differences were observed in the response of the two enzymes to the assay temperature, such that the activation energies for phosphocellulose Peak II were about 50% higher than for Peak I. The apparent Km values for nucleoside triphosphates were essentially identical for both enzymes. For ATP with tRNApCpC as cosubstrate the Km values were 3 mm and 2 mm for enzymes I and II, respectively; using tRNApC as cosubstrate the apparent Km with Peak II was 2 mm. In the case of CTP, biphasic double reciprocal plots were found which suggested the existence of two CTP binding sites. The data for each enzyme could be fit to curves generated from Km values of 0.004 mm and 0.4 mm and appropriate Vmax values. Similar Km values for CTP were obtained with tRNApC or tRNApX as cosubstrate although the Vmax values differed. UTP, which acted as an analogue of CTP, gave apparent Km values of 0.06 mm and 0.05 mm with enzymes I and II using tRNApC as cosubstrate. Both tRNA nucleotidyltransferases could utilize Mg++, Mn++, and Co++ to satisfy the requirement for divalent cation, but the latter two ions were less effective than Mg++. The rate of nucleotide incorporation into tRNAs with defined termini, as well as into other nucleic acids, was examined. tRNApCpCpA, rRNA, calf thymus DNA, or poly(C) were inactive as acceptors for either AMP, CMP, or UMP. tRNApCpC was a substrate for AMP incorporation, but was inactive with CTP or UTP. tRNApC and tRNApX were substrates for both CMP and UMP incorporation, but displayed diminishing activity in the presence of ATP. The apparent Km values for the various tRNA substrates were in the range of 4 to 30 µm, and were increased by the incorrect triphosphate. Liver tRNA nucleotidyltransferase showed no species specificity for the source of tRNA, being equally active with material from rabbit liver, yeast, and Escherichia coli. The extents of AMP, CMP, and UMP incorporation into tRNApC catalyzed by each enzyme were essentially the same suggesting that both enzymes probably acted on the same tRNA population. Another difference between the two tRNA nucleotidyltransferases was their response to a variety of salts. AMP incorporation catalyzed by either enzyme was inhibited by all salts examined. On the other hand, CMP incorporation catalyzed by Peak I was relatively little affected by monovalent salts at ionic strengths below 0.25, and that catalyzed by Peak II was greatly stimulated. These results point out that although many of the properties of the two enzymes are quite similar, significant differences do exist. A possible model for tRNA nucleotidyltransferase action is also presented."
https://openalex.org/W1528035656,"Abstract To gain information about the properties of tyrosyl residues buried within proteins, the circular dichroism (CD) and absorption spectra of tyrosine derivatives have been investigated in nonpolar solvents. N-Stearyl-l-tyrosine n-hexyl ester dissolved in methylcyclohexane (O—O band at 283 nm) was used to measure the effects of hydrogen-bonding agents. Adding low concentrations of dioxane, N,N-dimethylacetamide, 1-butanol, or methanol causes a 1- to 4-nm red shift in the absorption spectrum and a 10 to 25% increase in the dipole strength. The results with N,N-dimethylacetamide suggest that a hydrogen bond between a tyrosyl hydroxy group and a carbonyl oxygen of the peptide backbone may be one mechanism for producing a large red shift in proteins. CD spectra were recorded after the hydroxy group of N-stearyl-l-tyrosine n-hexyl ester had been hydrogen bonded. Dioxane and N,N-dimethylacetamide cause the CD spectra to red shift and intensify to the same extent as do the absorption spectra. Evidently hydrogen bonding to these compounds does not alter the conformation of this tyrosine derivative. In contrast, hydrogen bonding of N-stearyl-l-tyrosine n-hexyl ester to butanol or methanol causes a 50% loss of rotatory strength, suggesting an altered conformation. The dependence upon alcohol concentration is the same for both the CD and absorption alterations (halfmaximal effect at 30 mm alcohol). Evidence is presented that a polymeric form of the alcohol may simultaneously hydrogen bond to both the hydroxy group and the amide oxygen atom of N-stearyl-l-tyrosine n-hexyl ester. At concentrations greater than 15 µm, N-stearyl-l-tyrosine n-hexyl ester is partially aggregated in methylcyclohexane, causing changes in the CD and absorption spectra. The aggregate is proposed to be mainly a dimer in which the hydroxy group of each tyrosine residue is hydrogen bonded to the amide oxygen of the other residue (K ≈ 1000 m-1). To minimize aggregation, N-acetyl-O-methyl-l-tyrosine ethyl ester (N-Ac-O-Me-l-Tyr ethyl ester) and N-stearyl-Omethyl-l-tyrosine n-hexyl ester were studied. O-Methyl tyrosine derivatives have the same vibronic structure as does tyrosine, but the wave length position is not much shifted by polar organic solvents (O—O band at 283.5 ± 0.5 nm). The rotatory strengths of O-methyl-l-tyrosine derivatives are nearly identical with those of l-tyrosine derivatives in corresponding solvents. For N-Ac-O-Me-l-Tyr ethyl ester dissolved in methylcyclohexane at 297 K, the rotatory strength is especially large (1.3 x 10-40 c.g.s. with Δe = 0.75 m-1 cm-1 at 277 nm). Upon cooling N-Ac-O-Me-l-Tyr ethyl ester (dissolved in ether-isopentane-ethanol solvent) from 297 to 140 K, the negative rotational strength is intensified 10-fold. These results are interpreted in terms of temperature shifting the equilibrium distribution of the various conformers of N-Ac-O-Me-l-Tyr ethyl ester. The variable temperature CD technique may provide a way to detect motility of the tyrosyl side chains in proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1486939229,"Abstract Rabbit liver tRNA nucleotidyltransferase was purified 25,000-fold to apparent homogeneity and a specific activity under optimal conditions of 2,000 µmoles of AMP incorporated into tRNA per hour per mg of protein. At the final step of purification the enzyme was fractionated into two species, both of which incorporated AMP, CMP, and UMP into tRNA, although with different relative rates. Both proteins had molecular weights of about 48,000 and s20,w values of about 4. Acrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate suggested that both proteins were single polypeptide chains. The purified enzymes were found to aggregate at elevated protein levels, but this could be prevented by high concentrations of phosphate. The amino acid compositions of both proteins were similar except for a difference in the half-cystine content. Furthermore, the species with the greater number of half-cystine residues was also more sensitive to a variety of sulfhydryl reagents. Neither protein contained any nucleotide material as determined by the ultraviolet absorption spectrum. Both enzymes were inhibited by dithiothreitol, and the AMP-, CMP-, and UMP-incorporating activities of both proteins were sensitive to incubation at temperatures between 42° and 50°. The molecular weight of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase changed during purification from about 80,000 in cruder fractions to about 48,000 after chromatography on DEAEcellulose. Evidence is presented which suggests that the molecular weight change was due to removal of bound tRNA. The formation of a tight complex between the purified enzyme and tRNA was also demonstrated."

https://openalex.org/W1512019646,"Abstract Preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has been used in the final stages of purification to prepare horse serum cholinesterase which was at least 95% pure, as judged by analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The starting material, already purified about 109-fold by the Strelitz method, was purified an additional 89-fold by the procedure. The method involved Sephadex G-200 and Sepharose 6B gel filtration followed by two successive preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis steps. The main problem involved a polyacrylamide gel contaminant. The molecular weight of cholinesterase by Sepharose 6B gel filtration was 315,000. The weight per active site of 143,500 was estimated from diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate titrations and dry weight determinations. The subunit weight of 77,300 was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A cholinesterase molecule consisting of two active sites and four subunits was indicated. Purified preparations were stable to dialysis, high dilutions, and during prolonged storage. The kinetic behavior of the purified material was complex, suggesting more than one form. With butyrylcholine a Km of 0.29 mm and a turnover number of 171,000 min-1 was obtained at 25°, pH 7.6. A Km of 0.53 mm and a turnover number of 61,020 min-1 was obtained with acetylthiocholine at 25°, pH 8.1."

https://openalex.org/W1601486726,"Abstract A human phosphoglycerate kinase variant, associated with faster anodal electrophoretic mobility in starch gel, was purified and crystallized from red blood cells of subjects in New Guinea. An apparently identical variant enzyme was also purified from a male in the Samoa Islands. The variant enzyme had the same molecular weight, 50,000, and the same specific enzyme activity, 700 units per mg, as the wild type enzyme. The isoelectric point of the variant enzyme, determined by the isoelectric focusing method, was pH 4.7 as compared with pH 7.9 for the normal enzyme. Although active variant enzyme moved toward the anode much faster than the normal enzyme in starch gel electrophoresis using a Tris-citrate buffer system at pH 7.5, no significant difference was found in electrophoretic mobility of the enzymes in other buffer systems without citrate. Lyophilized preparations of the normal and variant enzyme were enzymatically inactive, showed identical electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using Tris-citrate buffer at pH 7.5, and had identical isoelectric points. These findings suggest that the fast electrophoretic mobility and the acidic isoelectric point of the variant enzyme are not due to intrinsic charge differences caused by the amino acid substitution, but due to a secondary alteration of the protein charge presumably induced by association with citrate. In fact, an electrically neutral amino acid substitution, from threonine in the normal enzyme to asparagine in the variant enzyme, was suggested by peptide mapping of their tryptic digests. The phosphoglycerate kinase variant found in a male from the Samoa Islands was identical with the variant enzyme found in New Guinea."

Proportional thermoregulation stabilized the subcutaneous temperature of the foot pad to a precision of +/- 0.7 degrees C (largest deviations). Selective shunting of blood-borne body heat through a cutaneous vascular plexus in the foot pad accounted for more than 99 percent of measured heat loss from the pad surface. Maximum energetic efficiency is achieved because the unit of heat exchange is located in the pad surface which contacts the cold substrate rather than throughout the pad."

https://openalex.org/W1598232825,"Abstract The subcellular localization in rat liver of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase has been examined. The major portion of the activity in untreated subcellular fractions was present in the high speed supernatant fraction. Treatment of the liver homogenate with Triton X-100 or subjecting it to freezing and thawing increased tRNA nucleotidyltransferase activity about 50 to 70% suggesting that a substantial portion of the enzyme was present within organelles and unavailable for assay. Extraction of the various subcellular fractions revealed that mitochondria contained tRNA nucleotidyltransferase amounting to about one-third of the total activity in liver. Microsomes and nuclei were essentially devoid of activity. The activity in the mitochondrial fraction was shown not to be due to bacterial contamination. The distribution of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase upon isopycnic centrifugation in sucrose gradients was identical with the mitochondrial marker enzyme, cytochrome oxidase. Fractionation of mitochondria by digitonin treatment indicated that the enzyme was localized in the mitochondrial matrix. The catalytic properties of the tRNA nucleotidyltransferase activity in mitochondrial extracts were very similar to those of the homogeneous enzymes described previously in that it had an unusually alkaline pH optimum and was active with either ATP, CTP, or UTP. The enzyme required tRNA for activity and was essentially inactive with rRNA or in the absence of added RNA. These results suggest that mitochondria may contain a system for the maturation of tRNA molecules."

The time course of these t.. reshold changes indicates that the rod system has a longer latency than the cone system.
https://openalex.org/W1600473664,"Abstract The incorporation of l-[U-14C]lysine into the α and β chains of hemoglobin has been compared in acetylphenylhydrazine-induced rabbit reticulocytes and normal and acetylphenylhydrazine-induced rabbit marrow. Evidence for a pool of α chains and αβ dimers in both reticulocytes and marrow cells was found in (a) an α:β specific activity ratio of less than 1.0 in purified hemoglobin, (b) the relative losses of α and β chain radioactivity on purification of the hemoglobin, (c) the radioactivity elution profile observed on gel filtration of the ribosome-free hemolysate, and (d) the effects of hemin added to the postincubation hemolysate. However, the data also indicated that the pool of α chains is smaller in the marrow cell than in the reticulocyte. In both groups of cells, addition of hemin to the incubation medium was followed by greater synthesis of α and β chains than was observed in the control cells. In addition, in marrow cells it was associated with virtually complete disappearance of the α chain and αβ pools, as evidenced by an increase in the α:β specific activity ratio in purified hemoglobin to almost 1.0 and by the disappearance of the high specific activity minor peak from the gel elution profile. On the basis of pulse labeling and chase experiments it was confirmed that both the pool of α chains and αβ dimers exist as intermediates in the pathway of hemoglobin biosynthesis. However, in the reticulocyte the radioactive α chain pool could be chased into hemoglobin to only a limited extent, in contrast to the marrow where almost complete transfer of radioactivity into hemoglobin occurred during the chase period. It is suggested that in the developing erythroid cell heme serves to promote hemoglobin synthesis by (a) promoting the synthesis of α and β chains and (b) promoting the conversion of αβ dimers to the hemoglobin tetramer. In addition it also serves to coordinate the synthesis and assembly of α and β chains."
https://openalex.org/W1523548303,"Abstract The dialyzable fraction obtained after degradation of Micrococcus lysodeikticus cell wall with egg white lysozyme was fractionated on columns of Dowex 50 and Dowex 1 ion exchange resins. In addition to the di- and tetrasaccharides and disaccharide peptides previously reported, a new tetrasaccharide and a new disaccharide were isolated in low yields, about 3 to 4% and 2%, respectively, of the total carbohydrate chain of the peptidoglycan. The tetrasaccharide contains 2 residues of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucose (N-acetylglucosamine), 1 residue of N-acetylmuramic acid, and 1 residue of muramic acid, probably as the internal amide. The disaccharide contains 1 residue of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucose (1 → 4)-linked to 1 residue of manno-muramic acid. The latter component gave by drastic hydrolysis 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-mannose (d-mannosamine) and was found, by gasliquid chromatography of the per(trimethylsilyl) ether of the methyl ester methyl α-d-glycoside, to be identical with synthetic manno-muramic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1535674697,"Abstract Ultracentrifugation studies on hemolysates from the erythrocytes of the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, showed that in dilute solution oxygenated hemoglobins were in a monomeric form with a molecular weight of approximately 18,000. In deoxygenated hemolysates or in concentrated solutions of oxygenated hemolysates, an aggregate product appeared which was considered to be a tetramer, as judged from its sedimentation coefficient. Contrary to a previous report, the hemolysate of the hagfish showed weak but significant heme-heme interaction (n = 1.2) depending on its hemoglobin concentration and pH. In the hemolysate, four hemoglobin components were found by electrophoresis, and other hemoglobins, if any, were very small in amount. The four components were preparatively separated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite. Among them only one component, F3, aggregated slightly by itself, whereas the other three hemoglobins did not. No components in their isolated state showed significant heme-heme interaction. The hemoglobins of E. burgeri could be divided into two classes; one (F1 and probably F2) hardly aggregated with any other components, and the components of the other (F3 and F4) aggregated with each other, especially in the deoxygenated state, and formed a hybrid tetramer which showed heme-heme interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1623732412,"Abstract Sucrose phosphorylase is active in various alcohol-water mixtures and can catalyze the transfer of the glucosyl moiety of sucrose to the alcohols forming the corresponding glucosides. The efficiency of the glucosyl acceptor (Vmax/Km) decreases in the order: trans-1,2-cyclohexanediol (0.057) ≈ ethylene glycol (0.061) g methanol (0.017) ≈ cis-1,2-cyclohexanediol (0.015) g ethanol (0.002) g water (0.001). The dependence of the rates on the concentration of each of the alcohols yields kinetics which shows saturation suggesting that each of the alcohols binds to the enzyme. The apparent Vmax for most of the alcohols is similar to the hydrolytic rate. trans-1,2-Cyclohexanediol and ethylene glycol react with the glucosyl enzyme without reducing the rate of hydrolysis although the water concentration is significantly reduced as the concentration of the alcohol is varied (e.g. 0 to 30% ethylene glycol by volume). trans-1,2-Cyclohexanediol is competitive with phosphate and noncompetitive with sucrose. Ethylene glycol is noncompetitive with both phosphate and sucrose. cis-1,2-Cyclohexanediol and methanol reduce the rate of hydrolysis. The reaction with methanol yields α-methylglucoside, and its rate of formation is apparently not reduced by phosphate. It was concluded that two separate, independent binding sites exist. These were designated water site, at which water and probably methanol react, and acceptor site, at which phosphate and the sugar acceptors as well as trans-1,2-cyclohexanediol and ethylene glycol react. The site of interaction of cis-1,2-cyclohexanediol is uncertain. Two adjacent hydroxyl groups on the glucosyl acceptor molecule seems to be a necessary, but possibly not a sufficient property for interaction at the acceptor site."

Much of the motor cells' complex activity can be explained by the varying strengths of activation from these two rhythmic sources and by a cell-to-cell gradation in sensitivity to driving inputs, a property that is correlated with axon diameter."
https://openalex.org/W1546982810,"Abstract The synthesis of the d-manno analogue of muramic acid, 2-amino-3-O-(d-1-carboxyethyl)-2-deoxy-d-mannose, was started from methyl 2-acetamido-4,6-O-benzylidene-3-O-(methylsulfonyl)-α-d-altropyranoside, which was transformed into methyl 2-acetamido-4,6-O-benzylidene-2-deoxy-α-d-mannopyranoside. After condensation with l-2-chloropropionic acid and removal of the protective benzylidene group, hydrolysis gave the title compound in amorphous form. The N-acetyl derivative, also amorphous, could be easily identified from the d-gluco and d-galacto analogues by gas-liquid chromatography of the per(trimethylsilyl) derivatives of the N-acetyl derivatives. Separation of the d-gluco and d-manno analogues was also accomplished on the per-(trimethylsilyl) derivatives of the methyl N-acetyl-α-d-glycoside, methyl esters, and amides."
https://openalex.org/W1569152924,"The in vitro inhibition of hepatic acetyl-CoA carboxylase by lipid-lowering agents, reported previously, is also demonstrable in drug-treated rats. Levels of measurable acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity are significantly lower in the livers of rats treated with 2-methyl-2-[p-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl)-phenoxy]-propionic acid than those of controls animals. Male or female and different strains of rats exhibit this depression of enzyme activity on drug treatment under a variety of nutritional states, including pair feeding. The inhibition is reversible, as shown by annulment of the effect on dialysis of the enzyme preparations against a citrate-containing buffer. Treatment of rats with 14C-labeled drug and fractionation of the liver homogenate shows preferential association of the drug with the acetyl-CoA carboxylase-containing fraction. On dialysis the 14C activity of the drug is removed and the enzyme activity returns to control levels."

https://openalex.org/W2030351507,"The fibroblasts derived from the skin of a woman heterozygous for an X-linked deficiency of phosphoglycerate kinase represented a mosaic. Two of 22 clones with normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and hypoxanthine(guanine) phosphoribosyltransferase activity had no phosphoglycerate kinase activity detected by electrophoresis. Because the loci for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogeniase and hypoxanthine(guanine)phosphoribosyltransferase are already known to undergo inactivation and to be on the short arm of the X chromosome and the locus for phosphoglycerate kinase is on the long arm, these observations support the conclusion that the entire human X chromosome can be involved in X inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2084185621,"The radioactive emanation product lead-212 is useful in estimating rates of air exchange within the urban boundary layer. The concentration of lead-212 is negligible in air of oceanic origin as well as in air above continental areas under snow cover. On several days when conditions were such that one of these types of air mass approached New York City, measurements were made which show that the source strength of lead-212 within the city is relatively constant. On two such days vertical profiles of the concentration of lead-212 were measured from the Empire State Building, which served as a sampling tower. From the data of these profiles and a two-layer model of the urban boundary layer, we estimate the vertical eddy diffusivity to be of the order of tens of square meters per second and the residence time of air within the street layer to be of the order of S minutes. These results are consistent with the observed distribution of stable lead and with an independent estimate of the eddy viscosity from a wind profile. Under moderate wind conditions and with a mixing depth of hundreds of meters, virtually all the horizontal transport of lead-212 and other tracers with street-level sources takes place in the advective layer."
https://openalex.org/W1649140860,"Abstract The study describes an algorithm and specifies conditions for obtaining data by sedimentation equilibrium to study nonideal associating systems. The algorithm can analyze systems of up to four macromolecular components, and it returns values of their concentrations plus a single nonideality coefficient B. By appropriate mathematical manipulations the algorithm is made to solve by least squares for linear coefficients, rather than attempting the more cumbersome iterative fitting of nonlinear regression. Synthetic data with realistic errors, both random and systematic, were used to test the reliability of the answers obtained and to define the optimum experimental conditions which can yield data capable of analysis. Equations are derived which permit the simultaneous solution of data from two ultracentrifuge cells and thus extend the concentration range studied. Extension of the concentration range is essential for all systems with more than two macromolecular components. Synthetic systems of widely varying association constants, number of species, and degree of nonideality were analyzed successfully. The dissociation constants varied from 1.0 x 10-3 m to 3.74 x 10-6 m; the second virial coefficient was varied from 0 to 3.0 x 10-5 mole dl g-2. Statistical tests for constructing confidence regions are used in determining the reliability of the parameters obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2042068278,"The relation of cellular sex genotype to phenotype was examined in seminal vesicles of adult allophenic mice with cellular sex chromosome mosaicism. Each animal originated from conjoined blastomeres of an embryo of female (XX) and one of male (XY) constitution, from different inbred strains. Cells of both sexes were detected in bone marrow and certain other somatic tissues; cellular sex of seminal vesicles was deduced from strain-associated electrophoretic variants of proteins coded for at autosomal loci. Seminal vesicles composed partly or entirely of female cells were found in male and pseudohermaphrodite individuals. In a pseudohermaphrodite, both allelic variants of the tissue-specific normal male seminal vesicle protein (Svp-locus) were present, signifying that female as well as male cells were synthesizing the protein. Male-determining factors on the Y chromosome are thus not required in cells that differentiate into functional seminal vesicles."

Assembly is inhibited by several compounds containing the group N—CN. The effectiveness of such compounds in the inhibition of assembly is roughly parallel to their effectiveness as protein denaturants, but assembly is vastly more sensitive toward these compounds than is ordinary protein denaturation."
