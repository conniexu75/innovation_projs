https://openalex.org/W2103412200,"The advent of next generation sequencing has coincided with a growth in interest in using these approaches to better understand the role of the structure and function of the microbial communities in human, animal, and environmental health. Yet, use of next generation sequencing to perform 16S rRNA gene sequence surveys has resulted in considerable controversy surrounding the effects of sequencing errors on downstream analyses. We analyzed 2.7×106 reads distributed among 90 identical mock community samples, which were collections of genomic DNA from 21 different species with known 16S rRNA gene sequences; we observed an average error rate of 0.0060. To improve this error rate, we evaluated numerous methods of identifying bad sequence reads, identifying regions within reads of poor quality, and correcting base calls and were able to reduce the overall error rate to 0.0002. Implementation of the PyroNoise algorithm provided the best combination of error rate, sequence length, and number of sequences. Perhaps more problematic than sequencing errors was the presence of chimeras generated during PCR. Because we knew the true sequences within the mock community and the chimeras they could form, we identified 8% of the raw sequence reads as chimeric. After quality filtering the raw sequences and using the Uchime chimera detection program, the overall chimera rate decreased to 1%. The chimeras that could not be detected were largely responsible for the identification of spurious operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and genus-level phylotypes. The number of spurious OTUs and phylotypes increased with sequencing effort indicating that comparison of communities should be made using an equal number of sequences. Finally, we applied our improved quality-filtering pipeline to several benchmarking studies and observed that even with our stringent data curation pipeline, biases in the data generation pipeline and batch effects were observed that could potentially confound the interpretation of microbial community data."

Here, we investigated decorin during normoxic angiogenic signaling. An angiogenic PCR array revealed a profound decorin-evoked transcriptional inhibition of pro-angiogenic genes, such as HIF1A. Decorin evoked a reduction of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in MDA-231 breast carcinoma cells expressing constitutively-active HIF-1α. Suppression of Met with decorin or siRNA evoked a similar reduction of VEGFA by attenuating downstream β-catenin signaling. These data establish a noncanonical role for β-catenin in regulating VEGFA expression. We found that exogenous decorin induced expression of thrombospondin-1 and TIMP3, two powerful angiostatic agents. In contrast, decorin suppressed both the expression and enzymatic activity of matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-9 and MMP-2, two pro-angiogenic proteases. Our data establish a novel duality for decorin as a suppressor of tumor angiogenesis under normoxia by simultaneously down-regulating potent pro-angiogenic factors and inducing endogenous anti-angiogenic agents.

IntroductionA pertinent concept in the field of tumorigenesis is the critical role of the extracellular matrix as an active participant in the regulation of diverse cell processes and signaling events that form an environment signified by ever changing flux (1.Bissell M.J. Hines W.C. Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). These diverse cellular processes, permissive for tumor progression, are often modulated by matrix constituents that culminate to affect tumor invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis (2.Ferrara N. Kerbel R.S. Angiogenesis as a therapeutic target.Nature. 2005; 438: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar).Various members of the proteoglycan gene family are intimately involved in regulating tumor angiogenesis by directly affecting key downstream signaling pathways via interaction with ligands and their cognate receptors (3.Iozzo R.V.

The apparent dichotomous effects reported for decorin on endothelial cells and the perceived function on the tumor itself creates a scenario where decorin is able to differentially modulate angiogenesis. This is further substantiated by a recent report where the expression of decorin was evaluated as a function of tumor malignancy. Sarcomas exhibited almost a complete absence of decorin in contrast to hemangiomas, where decorin was predominantly detected in the surrounding stroma (74.Salomäki H.H. Sainio A.O. Söderström M.

Abella J.V. Park M. Cross-talk in Met receptor oncogenesis.Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 542-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the Met signaling axis is powerfully pro-angiogenic, specifically promoting VEGFA-mediated angiogenesis (76.Grant D.S.

These observations coupled to the discovery of rapid and sustained physical down-regulation of Met evoked by nanomolar concentrations of recombinant decorin (51.Goldoni S. Humphries A. Nyström A.

The angiostatic effects resulting in a marked inhibition of VEGFA occur at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels with upstream signaling occurring via Met, which is antagonized by decorin. Furthermore, our findings indicate a novel induction of thrombospondin-1 and TIMP3, coincident with the suppression of pro-angiogenic molecules. Thus, our data reinforce and extend the critical role for decorin as an antagonist of tumor angiogenesis.DISCUSSIONThe steps involved in tumor progression have been derived from multiple animal models and reflect discrete changes within the genome via activation of oncogenes or the silencing of tumor suppressor genes that drive a normal cell through transformation to a malignant phenotype (115.Hahn W.C. Weinberg R.A. Rules for making human tumor cells.N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 1593-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). A key milestone on the path to cancer progression is the development of a competent tumor vasculature to provide a blood supply as well as a conduit for metastasis. This event is mediated via a discrete step known as the angiogenic switch, which results in an imbalance of key pro-angiogenic cytokines and angiogenic inhibitors. Previous reports implicate decorin as a powerful inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis (73.Grant D.S. Yenisey C. Rose R.W. Tootell M. Santra M. Iozzo R.V. Decorin suppresses tumor cell-mediated angiogenesis.Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4765-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In our current working model (Fig. 7) stromal decorin engages and abrogates the HGF/Met signaling axis, acting as a potent suppressor of VEGFA-mediated tumor angiogenesis. Decorin binding to Met initiates receptor internalization via increased phosphorylation of Tyr1003, which is a recruitment site for the E3 ubquitin ligase c-Cbl. This mechanism triggers caveolar-mediated endocytosis of the receptor complex, culminating in the transcriptional repress"

Bushmeat consumption has been particularly poorly studied in Madagascar, one of the world's hottest biodiversity hotspots. Studying bushmeat consumption is challenging as many species are protected and researchers must consider the incentives faced by informants. Using interviews with 1154 households in 12 communes in eastern Madagascar, as well as local monitoring data, we investigated the importance of socio-economic variables, taste preference and traditional taboos on consumption of 50 wild and domestic species. The majority of meals contain no animal protein. However, respondents consume a wide range of wild species and 95% of respondents have eaten at least one protected species (and nearly 45% have eaten more than 10). The rural/urban divide and wealth are important predictors of bushmeat consumption, but the magnitude and direction of the effect varies between species. Bushmeat species are not preferred and are considered inferior to fish and domestic animals. Taboos have provided protection to some species, particularly the Endangered Indri, but we present evidence that this taboo is rapidly eroding. By considering a variety of potential influences on consumption in a single study we have improved understanding of who is eating bushmeat and why. Evidence that bushmeat species are not generally preferred meats suggest that projects which increase the availability of domestic meat and fish may have success at reducing demand. We also suggest that enforcement of existing wildlife and firearm laws should be a priority, particularly in areas undergoing rapid social change. The issue of hunting as an important threat to biodiversity in Madagascar is only now being fully recognised. Urgent action is required to ensure that heavily hunted species are adequately protected."
https://openalex.org/W2024078075,"Known therapies for influenza A virus infection are complicated by the frequent emergence of resistance. A therapeutic strategy that may escape viral resistance is targeting host cellular mechanisms involved in viral replication and pathogenesis. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, also known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), is a primitive, evolutionary conserved molecular signaling cascade that has been implicated in multiple biological phenomena including innate immunity and the pathogenesis of certain viral infections. We investigated the effect of influenza A viral infection on ER stress pathways in lung epithelial cells. Influenza A virus induced ER stress in a pathway-specific manner. We showed that the virus activates the IRE1 pathway with little or no concomitant activation of the PERK and the ATF6 pathways. When we examined the effects of modulating the ER stress response on the virus, we found that the molecular chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) significantly inhibits influenza A viral replication. In addition, a specific inhibitor of the IRE1 pathway also blocked viral replication. Our findings constitute the first evidence that ER stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of influenza A viral infection. Decreasing viral replication by modulating the host ER stress response is a novel strategy that has important therapeutic implications."

For Alzheimer's disease (AD), the focus is the amyloid beta peptide (Aß) that mediates familial Alzheimer's disease pathology. However, given that age is the greatest risk factor for AD, we explored an alternative drug discovery scheme that is based upon efficacy in multiple cell culture models of age-associated pathologies rather than exclusively amyloid metabolism. Using this approach, we identified an exceptionally potent, orally active, neurotrophic molecule that facilitates memory in normal rodents, and prevents the loss of synaptic proteins and cognitive decline in a transgenic AD mouse model."

SES was measured by education and income while diabetes was self-reported.Over 12.3 years of follow-up, 1,262 women developed diabetes. In age and race adjusted models, the relative risk of diabetes decreased with increasing education (<2 years of nursing, 2 to <4 years of nursing, bachelor's degree, master's degree, and doctorate: 1.0, 0.7 [95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.6-0.8], 0.6 (95% CI, 0.5-0.7), 0.5 (95% CI, 0.4-0.6), 0.4 (95% CI, 0.3-0.5); p(trend)<0.001). Adjustment for traditional and non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors attenuated this relationship (education: p(trend) = 0.96).

https://openalex.org/W2100132717,"l-Cysteine desulfurases provide sulfur to several metabolic pathways in the form of persulfides on specific cysteine residues of an acceptor protein for the eventual incorporation of sulfur into an end product. IscS is one of the three Escherichia coli l-cysteine desulfurases. It interacts with FdhD, a protein essential for the activity of formate dehydrogenases (FDHs), which are iron/molybdenum/selenium-containing enzymes. Here, we address the role played by this interaction in the activity of FDH-H (FdhF) in E. coli. The interaction of IscS with FdhD results in a sulfur transfer between IscS and FdhD in the form of persulfides. Substitution of the strictly conserved residue Cys-121 of FdhD impairs both sulfur transfer from IscS to FdhD and FdhF activity. Furthermore, inactive FdhF produced in the absence of FdhD contains both metal centers, albeit the molybdenum cofactor is at a reduced level. Finally, FdhF activity is sulfur-dependent, as it shows reversible sensitivity to cyanide treatment. Conclusively, FdhD is a sulfurtransferase between IscS and FdhF and is thereby essential to yield FDH activity. l-Cysteine desulfurases provide sulfur to several metabolic pathways in the form of persulfides on specific cysteine residues of an acceptor protein for the eventual incorporation of sulfur into an end product.

Conclusively, FdhD is a sulfurtransferase between IscS and FdhF and is thereby essential to yield FDH activity. l-Cysteine is the sulfur source for the biosynthesis of a variety of cofactors, such as iron-sulfur clusters, thiamine, molybdopterin, and biotin, and for the modification of tRNA (1Kessler D. Enzymatic activation of sulfur for incorporation into biomolecules in prokaryotes.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 30: 825-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Incorporation of sulfur into biomolecules involves pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent l-cysteine desulfurases. They catalyze the conversion of l-cysteine to l-alanine with the concomitant release of the sulfane sulfur atom that forms a protein-bound persulfide intermediate (R-S-SH) on a conserved cysteine residue. The persulfide sulfur atom is then transferred to conserved cysteine residues in acceptor proteins to form new persulfide groups for the eventual incorporation of sulfur into an end product (2Zheng L.

Bacterial cysteine desulfurases: their function and mechanisms.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Sulfur transfer requires interaction between the l-cysteine desulfurase and the acceptor protein, usually resulting in stimulation of the activity of the former (4Loiseau L. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S.

In contrast to SufS and CsdA, IscS appears to be the physiological sulfur source for the cell. IscS belongs to the Isc (iron-sulfur cluster) system, the housekeeping [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis system. In addition to providing sulfur for [Fe-S] assembly, IscS is involved in thiamine, biotin, and molybdopterin synthesis, selenium incorporation, and tRNA modifications (1Kessler D. Enzymatic activation of sulfur for incorporation into biomolecules in prokaryotes.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 30: 825-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To commit sulfur to all of these different metabolic pathways, IscS is able to interact with and to transfer sulfur to different acceptor proteins. They all bind close to the catalytic cysteine residue of IscS (6Shi R. Proteau A. Villarroya M. Moukadiri I. Zhang L. Trempe J.F. Matte A. Armengod M.E. Cygler M.

As IscS is a dimer, acceptor proteins bind on each side of IscS, as was shown with the heterotetramers IscS-TusA and IscS-IscU (6Shi R. Proteau A. Villarroya M. Moukadiri I. Zhang L. Trempe J.F.

Moreover, they all contain a [4Fe-4S] cluster and a molybdenum cofactor (Moco) in their catalytic subunit as revealed by x-ray structure analysis of FdhF and FdnGHI (12Jormakka M. Törnroth S.

Here, we address the role played by the interaction of IscS with FdhD in the activity of FdhF in E. coli. We show that FdhD stimulates the l-cysteine desulfurase activity of IscS and recruits sulfur as persulfides from IscS. Substitution of the strictly conserved residue Cys-121 of FdhD prevents sulfur transfer from IscS and impairs FdhF activity. FdhF activity is sensitive to cyanide treatment, with the activity being restored with an exogenous sulfur source. Overall, our data support a model in which sulfur transfer occurs between IscS and FdhF, the sulfur being ultimately transferred to FdhF, a step indispensable for activity. Protein interactions were detected using a bacterial two-hybrid approach as described previously (18Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F.

The expression and purification of a His6-tagged version of IscS, FdhF(SeC140C), FdhD, and its variants were performed by nickel affinity chromatography as described supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” l-Cysteine desulfurase activity was measured as described previously (21Lehrke M.

The basic principle of the identification of protein-bound persulfides by use of 1,5-I-AEDANS has been described by Zheng et al. (22Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Mechanism for the desulfurization of l-cysteine catalyzed by the nifS gene product.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Proteins were first treated with DTT to reduce the thiol groups and remove any persulfides. In a typical experiment, 20 μg of the IscS protein and 40 μg of the FdhD protein were incubated in 13.5 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.3) in the presence of l-cysteine. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature for persulfide formation. The excess of l-cysteine was removed by dialysis before 0.5 μl of 0.5 mm 1,5-I-AEDANS solution was added to the reaction mixture, followed by incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, unbound 1,5-I-AEDANS was allowed to react with l-cysteine (1 μl of 2 mm stock solution) during 30 min at room temperature to prevent reaction of 1,5-I-AEDANS in subsequent reaction steps. To release possibly bound persulfides, 1 μl of 100 mm DTT solution was added to the reaction mixture, resulting in the formation of N-(thioacetyl)-N′-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (i.e. 1,5-AEDANS-sulfide conjugate) issued from reductive cleavage of the disulfide adduct. Subsequently, the reaction was supplemented with 2 μl of native loading buffer (2 m sucrose and 1% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and electrophoresed for 45 min at 200 V on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels (adjusted to pH 9.5 with 4 m NaOH to improve separation). Upon exposure to UV light, 1,5-I-AEDANS reaction products such as 1,5-AEDANS-labeled proteins, 1,5-AEDANS-sulfide conjugate, and excess 1,5-AEDANS bound by l-cysteine were visualized. After exposure to UV light, proteins in the same gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to allow comparison of protein amounts in each lane. Equal amounts of total proteins from crude extracts of the WT strain, fdhF, or fdhD transformed with an empty plasmid, pFdhD, or pFdhD(C121A/C124A) were subjected to SDS-12% PAGE. Proteins were then electrotransferred to a sheet of nitrocellulose, and immunoanalysis was performed using the ECL procedure (Amersham Biosciences) with a rabbit anti-FdhF primary antibody, followed by a goat secondary antibody. Metal analysis of purified FdhF(SeC140C) was performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Protein samples were wet-ashed in a 1:5 mixture with 65% (v/v) nitric acid for 2 days. Samples were then diluted with 3 ml of ultrapure water (18 megohms). The solutions obtained were then analyzed in triplicate by ICP-MS using a Thermo Series II ICP-MS apparatus (Thermo Electron, Les Ulis, France). As a reference, a multi-element standard solution (SCP Science, Quebec, Canada) was used. Metal concentrations were finally determined using PlasmaLab software (Thermo Electron). FDH (FdhF) activity was measured at 37 °C in an anaerobic glove box (100% N2) by following the reduction of benzyl viologen spectrophotometrically at 600 nm coupled to the oxidation of sodium formate (23Wu L.F. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Genetic and physiological characterization of new Escherichia coli mutants impaired in hydrogenase activity.Biochimie. 1986; 68: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). FDH activity is expressed in micromoles of formate reduced per min/mg of protein. Nitrate reductase (NarGH) activity was measured anaerobically at 37 °C by following the oxidation of reduced benzyl viologen spectrophotometrically at 600 nm coupled to the reduction of potassium nitrate (24Jones R.W.

Nitrate reductase-specific activity is expressed in micromoles of nitrate reduced per min/mg of protein. Sodium sulfide solution at a concentration of 10 mm was prepared by dissolving crystals in deionized water. The treatment was carried out with crude extract (140 μg) or purified FdhF(SeC140C) enzyme (10 μg) in the presence of 1.5 mg/ml benzyl viologen and 720 μm sodium sulfide in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, allowing them to reach a plateau. After 60 min of incubation, substrate (sodium formate or potassium nitrate) was added to the sample, and oxidation or reduction of benzyl viologen was measured spectrophotometrically at 600 nm. All steps were done in an anaerobic glove box. 260 μg of sodium sulfide-treated FdhF(SeC140C) was incubated with 1.5 mg/ml benzyl viologen and 50 mm KCN in 200 μl of 50 mm MES (pH 6), 50 mm Na2SO4, 2 mm DTT, and 3 mm NaN3 overnight at 4 °C. Excess KCN was separated from the protein with a 10-kDa cut-off Vivaspin concentrator (Sartorius) equilibrated in 50 mm MES (pH 6), 50 mm Na2SO4, 2 mm DTT, and 3 mm NaN3. The concentration of the resulting protein was determined by the Lowry detection method (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. Protein measurement with the Folin phenol reagent.J. Biol.

IscS was confirmed to interact with FdhD. It is noteworthy that no interaction was detected between IscS and FdhE, a protein also required for the activity of the two periplasmic respiratory FDHs (9Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Couchoux-Luthaud G.

Such specific interaction between IscS and FdhD was further confirmed by co-purification of IscS with His6-FdhD from a cell-free extract (supplemental Fig. S1). Altogether, these results show that IscS specifically interacts with FdhD.

On the basis of the tight interaction of IscS with FdhD, we next tested if the l-cysteine desulfurase activity of IscS is enhanced by FdhD. The addition of a 2-fold molar excess of FdhD increased the desulfurase activity of IscS by nearly 2-fold (Fig. 1B). The enhancement of IscS activity was specific to FdhD, as BSA, used as a control, showed no effect. Furthermore, FdhD showed no l-cysteine desulfurase activity. Enhancement of the activity of l-cysteine desulfurases by their physiological partners is usually seen as the result of transfer of the sulfane sulfur generated by the l-cysteine desulfurase to surface-exposed thiol groups of the protein partner. To determine whether any of the seven cysteine residues of FdhD are involved in the stimulation of IscS activity, FdhD was pretreated with the thiol-specific alkylating reagent N-ethylmaleimide. No stimulation of l-cysteine desulfurase activity was found (Fig. 1B), indicating that surface-exposed thiol groups of FdhD are involved in this stimulation. Multiple sequence alignment analysis of FdhD showed that, of the seven cysteine residues, only Cys-121 is strictly conserved (supplemental Fig. S2). Note that this residue is part of a cysteine- and glycine-rich region. In the sequence of E. coli FdhD, a second cysteine residue, Cys-124, is found close to Cys-121. To assess the importance of these cysteine residues, single and double variants were thus produced and tested for their ability to stimulate IscS activity (Fig. 1B). Although the FdhD(C124A) variant showed an unaffected stimulatory activity, substitution of the conserved Cys-121 residue led to reduction in (FdhD(C121A)) or a complete loss of (FdhD(C121A/C124A)) stimulation of the IscS activity. Used as a control, two-hybrid experiments confirmed that all variants were able to interact with IscS (supplemental Fig. S3). Therefore, the integrity of the conserved Cys-121 residue of FdhD is required for stimulation of the IscS activity. To evaluate whether sulfur atoms are transferred from IscS to FdhD, the presence of persulfides on FdhD was assessed using the fluorescent sulfhydryl-reactive alkylating reagent 1,5-I-AEDANS. Without l-cysteine (Fig. 2, first lane), IscS was labeled with 1,5-I-AEDANS, supporting the existence of surface-exposed cysteine residues. In the presence of l-cysteine (second lane), IscS was not labeled due to the resolution of the persulfides resulting from the l-cysteine desulfurase activity under reducing conditions. The 1,5-AEDANS-sulfide conjugates thus produced were observed at the bottom of the gel. In contrast, in the presence of l-cysteine and FdhD (third lane), no 1,5-AEDANS-sulfide conjugate was produced at the bottom of the gel, and FdhD was strongly labeled. This confirms that FdhD by itself is devoid of l-cysteine desulfurase activity and that FdhD has surface-exposed cysteine residues. When both proteins were mixed in the presence of l-cysteine (fourth lane), a 1,5-AEDANS-sulfide conjugate was produced, IscS was no longer labeled, and only a low level of labeling was observed on FdhD. Sulfane sulfur atoms were thus deposited by IscS on surface-exposed cysteine residues of FdhD and later released by DTT treatment. This experiment demonstrates that FdhD accepts sulfur from IscS in the form of persulfides and explains why FdhD is able to stimulate IscS l-cysteine desulfurase activity. Furthermore, when the FdhD(C121A) variant was used instead of FdhD together with IscS (Fig. 2, fifth lane), 1,5-AEDANS remained bound to both proteins, indicating a reduced ability of FdhD(C121A) to bind persulfides generated by IscS. The same result was obtained with the double-substituted mutant FdhD(C121A/C124A) (seventh lane), whereas in the case of the Cys-124 substitution (sixth lane), IscS and FdhD(C124A) were no longer labeled, indicating that all of the sulfane sulfur atoms generated by IscS were transferred to FdhD(C124A) and further cleaved off by DTT treatment as 1,5-AEDANS-sulfide conjugates. This situation is comparable with the one obtained with FdhD (fourth lane). Altogether, these results show that Cys-121 is crucial for efficient sulfur transfer between IscS and FdhD, whereas Cys-124 is not required. To analyze the importance of the fdhD gene product for FDH activity, the production and metal content of FdhF were evaluated in the absence of fdhD. At first, immunoblot analysis of cell-free extracts issued from the WT or fdhD strain revealed no differences in terms of FdhF production (Fig. 3). Next, the iron and molybdenum content was quantified by ICP-MS and expressed in moles of metal ion/mol of purified FdhF(SeC140C) issued from WT and fdhD cells, respectively. The iron content was unchanged (4.1 versus 4.2) and is in accordance with the presence of a single [4Fe-4S] cluster/enzyme. The molybdenum content was lower in the absence of FdhD (1 versus 0.6). Thus, FdhD appears to be essential neither for metal center insertion within FdhF nor for its stability. As the strictly conserved Cys-121 residue is essential for efficient sulfur transfer between IscS and FdhD, we next tested the importance of this residue for FdhF activity (Table 1). The C121A substitution led to a total loss of activity, supporting an essential role of this residue in the ability of FdhD to yield active FDHs. As expected, the double cysteine variant gave the same result as the C121A variant. Unexpectedly, the C124A substitution led to a total loss of FdhF activity. Two-hybrid experiments confirmed that all FdhD variants interacted with FdhF (supplemental Fig. S3). Finally, metal content analysis of FdhF(SeC140C) produced in the presence of the double cysteine variant of FdhD showed no difference compared with the situation in which fdhD was absent: a wild type-like [4Fe-4S] content (4 mol/mol of FdhF) and a reduced level of molybdenum (0.6 mol/mol of FdhF). These results show that FdhD and the Cys-121 and Cys-124 residues are not essential for metal center insertion. In conclusion, the Cys-121 and Cys-124 are essential for the function of FdhD assessed through the FdhF activity.TABLE 1Cys-121 and Cys-124 are required for function of FdhDStrainFdhF activityunits/mg proteinWT0.32 ± 0.1fdhDEmpty vector0pFdhD0.24 ± 0.08pFdhD(C121A)0pFdhD(C121A/C124A)0pFdhD(C124A)0 Open table in a new tab The importance of Cys-121 of FdhD in both catalyzing efficient sulfur transfer from IscS to FdhD and promoting FdhF activity prompted us to investigate whether FDH activity is sulfur-dependent. To this end, a cell-free extract issued from an fdhD strain was treated in vitro with sodium sulfide as an exogenous sulfur source and further tested for activity. As shown in Table 2, sulfide treatment restored the activity of FdhF from an fdhD extract to a level equivalent to the one obtained with a WT extr"
https://openalex.org/W1989118552,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis possesses unique cell-surface lipids that have been implicated in virulence. One of the most abundant is sulfolipid-1 (SL-1), a tetraacyl-sulfotrehalose glycolipid. Although the early steps in SL-1 biosynthesis are known, the machinery underlying the final acylation reactions is not understood. We provide genetic and biochemical evidence for the activities of two proteins, Chp1 and Sap (corresponding to gene loci rv3822 and rv3821), that complete this pathway. The membrane-associated acyltransferase Chp1 accepts a synthetic diacyl sulfolipid and transfers an acyl group regioselectively from one donor substrate molecule to a second acceptor molecule in two successive reactions to yield a tetraacylated product. Chp1 is fully active in vitro, but in M. tuberculosis, its function is potentiated by the previously identified sulfolipid transporter MmpL8. We also show that the integral membrane protein Sap and MmpL8 are both essential for sulfolipid transport. Finally, the lipase inhibitor tetrahydrolipstatin disrupts Chp1 activity in M. tuberculosis, suggesting an avenue for perturbing SL-1 biosynthesis in vivo. These data complete the SL-1 biosynthetic pathway and corroborate a model in which lipid biosynthesis and transmembrane transport are coupled at the membrane-cytosol interface through the activity of multiple proteins, possibly as a macromolecular complex."

RanBP2 exhibits specificity for SUMO1 as RanGAP1-SUMO1/UBC9 forms a more stable complex with RanBP2 compared with RanGAP1-SUMO2 that results in greater protection of RanGAP-SUMO1 from proteases. The IR1-M-IR2 SUMO E3 ligase activity also shows a similar preference for SUMO1. We utilized deletions and domain swap constructs in protease protection assays and automodification assays to define RanBP2 domains responsible for RanGAP1-SUMO1 protection and SUMO1-specific E3 ligase activity. Our data suggest that elements in both IR1 and IR2 exhibit specificity for SUMO1. IR1 protects RanGAP1-SUMO1/UBC9 and functions as the primary E3 ligase of RanBP2, whereas IR2 retains the ability to interact with SUMO1 to promote SUMO1-specific E3 ligase activity. To determine the structural basis for SUMO1 specificity, a hybrid IR1 construct and IR1 were used to determine three new structures for complexes containing UBC9 with RanGAP1-SUMO1/2. These structures show more extensive contacts among SUMO, UBC9, and RanBP2 in complexes containing SUMO1 compared with SUMO2 and suggest that differences in SUMO specificity may be achieved through these subtle conformational differences."

Variables included in the model were derived from respondents' answers to the experience of IPVAW, attitudes towards wife beating and witnessing physical violence in childhood. We found that women that witnessed physical violence were more likely to have tolerant attitudes towards IPVAW and women with tolerant attitudes were more likely to have reported spousal IPVAW abuse. Women with husbands with tolerant attitudes towards IPVAW were more likely to have reported spousal abuse. We found that an increasing proportion of women in the community with tolerant attitudes was significantly positively associated with spousal sexual and emotional abuse, but not significantly associated with spousal physical abuse. In addition, we found that an increasing proportion of men in the community with tolerant attitudes and an increasing proportion of women who had witnessed physical violence in the community was significantly positively associated with spousal physical abuse, but not significantly associated with spousal sexual and emotional abuse. There was a positive correlation between all three types of IPVAW at individual- and community-level.We found that community tolerant attitudes context in which people live is associated with exposure to IPVAW even after taking into account individual tolerant attitudes. Public health interventions designed to reduce IPVAW must address people and the communities in which they live in order to be successful."

Incorporation into the enzyme of a thiol-reactive FRET probe, pyrene iodoacetamide, allowed us to monitor the binding by FRET from the pyrene donor to the F7GA acceptor. Cooperativity of the interactions detected by FRET indicates that the enzyme possesses at least two F7GA-binding sites that have different FRET efficiencies and are therefore widely separated. To probe spatial localization of these sites, we studied FRET in a series of mutants bearing pyrene iodoacetamide at different positions, and we measured the distances from each of the sites to the donor.

https://openalex.org/W2065890643,"New Caledonian crows were presented with Bird and Emery's (2009a) Aesop's fable paradigm, which requires stones to be dropped into a water-filled tube to bring floating food within reach. The crows did not spontaneously use stones as tools, but quickly learned to do so, and to choose objects and materials with functional properties. Some crows discarded both inefficient and non-functional objects before observing their effects on the water level. Interestingly, the crows did not learn to discriminate between functional and non-functional objects and materials when there was an arbitrary, rather than causal, link between object and reward. This finding suggests that the crows' performances were not based on associative learning alone. That is, learning was not guided solely by the covariation rate between stimuli and outcomes or the conditioned reinforcement properties acquired by functional objects. Our results, therefore, show that New Caledonian crows can process causal information not only when it is linked to sticks and stick-like tools but also when it concerns the functional properties of novel types of tool."

https://openalex.org/W1999437357,"Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1) expression limits rates of de novo dTMP synthesis in the nucleus. Here we report that SHMT1 is ubiquitinated at the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) consensus motif and that ubiquitination at that site is required for SHMT1 degradation. SHMT1 protein levels are cell cycle-regulated, and Ub-SHMT1 levels are lowest at S phase when SHMT1 undergoes SUMO modification and nuclear transport. Mutation of the SUMO consensus motif increases SHMT1 stability. SHMT1 interacts with components of the proteasome in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating that degradation occurs in both compartments. Ubc13-mediated ubiquitination is required for SHMT1 nuclear export and increases stability of SHMT1 within the nucleus, whereas Ubc9-mediated modification with Sumo2/3 is involved in nuclear degradation. These data demonstrate that SUMO and ubiquitin modification of SHMT1 occurs on the same lysine residue and determine the localization and accumulation of SHMT1 in the nucleus."

Here we show that UV irradiation induces fragmentation in sublethal doses, but the broken chromosomes are repaired or degraded by RecBCD; therefore, to observe full fragmentation, RecBCD enzyme needs to be inactivated. Using quantitative pulsed field gel electrophoresis and sensitive DNA synthesis measurements, we investigated the mechanisms of UV radiation-induced chromosomal fragmentation in recBC mutants, comparing five existing models of DNA damage-induced fragmentation. We found that fragmentation depends on active DNA synthesis before, but not after, UV irradiation. At low UV irradiation doses, fragmentation does not need excision repair or daughter strand gap repair. Fragmentation absolutely depends on both RecA-catalyzed homologous strand exchange and RuvABC-catalyzed Holliday junction resolution. Thus, chromosomes fragment when replication forks stall at UV lesions and regress, generating Holliday junctions. Remarkably, cells specifically utilize fork breakage to rescue stalled replication and avoid lethality."
https://openalex.org/W2083454315,"Adult neurogenesis is maintained by self-renewable neural stem cells (NSCs). Their activity is regulated by multiple signaling pathways and key transcription factors. However, it has been unclear whether these factors interplay with each other at the molecular level. Here we show that SRY-box-containing gene 2 (Sox2) and nuclear receptor tailless (TLX) form a molecular network in adult NSCs. We observed that both Sox2 and TLX proteins bind to the upstream region of Tlx gene. Sox2 positively regulates Tlx expression, whereas the binding of TLX to its own promoter suppresses its transcriptional activity in luciferase reporter assays. Such TLX-mediated suppression can be antagonized by overexpressing wild-type Sox2 but not a mutant lacking the transcriptional activation domain. Furthermore, through regions involved in DNA-binding activity, Sox2 and TLX physically interact to form a complex on DNAs that contain a consensus binding site for TLX. Finally, depletion of Sox2 revealed the potential negative feedback loop of TLX expression that is antagonized by Sox2 in adult NSCs. These data suggest that Sox2 plays an important role in Tlx transcription in cultured adult NSCs."

The islet area in the pancreases of the FTY720-treated db/db mice was more than 2-fold larger than that of the untreated mice after 6 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, BrdU incorporation assays and Ki67 staining demonstrated cell proliferation in the islets and pancreatic duct areas. Finally, islets from the treated mice exhibited a significant decrease in the level of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57(KIP2) and an increase in the level of cyclin D3 as compared with those of untreated mice, which could be reversed by the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Our findings reveal a novel network that controls β-cell regeneration in the obesity-diabetes setting by regulating cyclin D3 and p57(KIP2) expression through the S1P signaling pathway. Therapeutic strategies targeting this network may promote in vivo regeneration of β-cells in patients and prevent and/or cure type 2 diabetes."

In addition, heparanase enhances the phosphorylation of selected signaling molecules, including SRC and EGFR, in a manner that requires secretion but not enzymatic activity of heparanase and is mediated by its C-terminal domain. Clinically, heparanase staining is associated with larger tumors and increased EGFR phosphorylation in head and neck carcinoma. We hypothesized that signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins mediate the protumorigenic function of heparanase downstream of the EGFR. We provide evidence that heparanase enhances the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5b but not STAT5a. Moreover, enhanced proliferation of heparanase transfected cells was attenuated by STAT3 and STAT5b siRNA, but not STAT5a or STAT1 siRNA. Clinically, STAT3 phosphorylation was associated with head and neck cancer progression, EGFR phosphorylation, and heparanase expression and cellular localization. Notably, cytoplasmic rather than nuclear phospho-STAT3 correlated with increased tumor size (T-stage; p = 0.007), number of metastatic neck lymph nodes (p = 0.05), and reduced survival of patients (p = 0.04).

https://openalex.org/W1978860964,"Complement C3 is a pivotal component of three cascades of complement activation. C3 is expressed in human atherosclerotic lesions and is involved in atherogenesis. However, the mechanism of C3 accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions is not well elucidated. We show that acetylated low density lipoprotein and oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) increase C3 gene expression and protein secretion by human macrophages. Modified LDL (mLDL)-mediated activation of C3 expression mainly depends on liver X receptor (LXR) and partly on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), whereas C3 secretion is increased due to TLR4 activation by mLDL. LXR agonist TO901317 stimulates C3 gene expression in human monocyte-macrophage cells but not in human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. We find LXR-responsive element inside of the promoter region of the human C3 gene, which binds to LXRβ in macrophages but not in HepG2 cells. We show that C3 expression and secretion is decreased in IL-4-treated (M2) and increased in IFNγ/LPS-stimulated (M1) human macrophages as compared with resting macrophages. LXR agonist TO901317 potentiates LPS-induced C3 gene expression and protein secretion in macrophages, whereas oxLDL differently modulates LPS-mediated regulation of C3 in M1 or M2 macrophages. Treatment of human macrophages with anaphylatoxin C3a results in stimulation of C3 transcription and secretion as well as increased oxLDL accumulation and augmented oxLDL-mediated up-regulation of the C3 gene. These data provide a novel mechanism of C3 gene regulation in macrophages and suggest new aspects of cross-talk between mLDL, C3, C3a, and TLR4 during development of atherosclerotic lesions."

These lesions generally block replicative DNA polymerases and are repaired by nucleotide excision repair or bypassed by translesion polymerases in the nucleus. Mitochondria lack nucleotide excision repair, and therefore, it is important to understand how the sole mitochondrial DNA polymerase, pol γ, interacts with irreparable lesions such as T-T. We performed in vitro DNA polymerization assays to measure the kinetics of incorporation opposite the lesion and bypass of the lesion by pol γ with a dimer-containing template. Exonuclease-deficient pol γ bypassed thymine dimers with low relative efficiency; bypass was attenuated but still detectable when using exonuclease-proficient pol γ. When bypass did occur, pol γ misincorporated a guanine residue opposite the 3′-thymine of the dimer only 4-fold less efficiently than it incorporated an adenine. Surprisingly, the pol γ exonuclease-proficient enzyme excised the incorrectly incorporated guanine at similar rates irrespective of the nature of the thymines in the template. In the presence of all four dNTPs, pol γ extended the primer after incorporation of two adenines opposite the lesion with relatively higher efficiency compared with extension past either an adenine or a guanine incorporated opposite the 3′-thymine of the T-T.

How pol γ behaves when it encounters photodimers has never been tested. The human pol γ holoenzyme consists of a catalytic subunit (encoded by POLG at chromosomal locus 15q25) and a dimeric form of its accessory subunit (encoded by POLG2 at chromosomal locus 17q24.1). The catalytic subunit is a 140-kDa enzyme (p140) that has DNA polymerase, 3′ → 5′ exonuclease, and 5′-deoxyribose phosphate lyase activities (18.Graziewicz M.A. Longley M.J. Copeland W.C. DNA polymerase γ in mitochondrial DNA replication and repair.Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 383-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The accessory subunit is a 55-kDa protein (p55) required for tight DNA binding and processive DNA synthesis (24.Lim S.E. Longley M.J. Copeland W.C.

We performed in vitro DNA polymerization reactions using a synthetic template oligonucleotide containing a single thymine dimer to measure the efficiency of incorporation and extension by pol γ opposite this lesion. Pol γ exhibited both accurate and mutagenic bypass. The efficiency of bypass was low compared with synthesis with an undamaged template but relatively high compared with other bulky lesions previously tested. Pol γ also showed higher efficiency of thymine dimer bypass than previously reported for other Family A polymerases (25.McCulloch S.D. Kunkel T.A. Multiple solutions to inefficient lesion bypass by T7 DNA polymerase.DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1373-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that pol γ most often stalls at thymine dimers, but it occasionally bypasses the lesion either accurately or aberrantly. These investigations offer a potential mechanism for short term tolerance of UV-induced mtDNA damage and also for long term UV-induced mtDNA mutagenesis. A recombinant catalytic subunit of human DNA pol γ (exonuclease-proficient and exonuclease-deficient forms) containing a His6 affinity tag at its N terminus was overproduced in baculovirus-infected insect (Sf9) cells, and the protein was purified to homogeneity as described previously (26.Lim S.E.

The eluted protein samples were visualized with SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were frozen in small aliquots in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Thymine dimer amidite was purchased from Glen Research and incorporated by TriLink BioTechnologies as the 17th-18th oligonucleotides from the 5′-end of the desired 45-mer template sequence 5′-CCAGCTCGGTACCGGGT-TAGCCTTTGGAGTCGACCTGCAGAAATT-3′. The oligonucleotide containing the thymine dimer was purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and homogeneity and purity were confirmed by mass spectrometry and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, respectively, by TriLink BioTechnologies. A matching template with an undimerized thymine pair at the same site was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Five primers for incorporation, and extension assays were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies and labeled at their 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The sequences of these primers are 1) a 25-mer oligonucleotide, 5′-AATTTCTGCAGGTCGACTCCAAAGG-3′, 2) a 27-mer oligonucleotide, 5′-AATTTCTGCAGGTCGACTCCAAAGGCT-3′, 3) a 29-mer oligonucleotide containing two additional adenines at the 3′-end of the 27-mer primer, 4) a 28-mer oligonucleotide terminating with one additional adenine at the 3′-end of the 27-mer primer, and 5) a 28-mer oligonucleotide terminating with an additional guanine at the 3′-end of the 27-mer primer. The 5′-end-labeled primers were annealed to a 1.2-fold molar excess of each 45-mer template using standard protocols. Separate batches of the previously described 27- and 29-mer oligonucleotides containing a fluorescein covalently linked to their 5′-end were purchased from Sigma. These oligonucleotides served as primers in DNA binding reactions. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined using polyacrylamide gel-based single nucleotide incorporation/extension assays. Reactions mixtures (10 μl) contained 25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 nm radiolabeled substrate, 10 nm exonuclease-deficient pol γ, and 20 nm p55. The reactions were started by the addition of one of the four dNTPs (at various concentrations depending on the substrate and analysis). After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, reactions were terminated by the addition (10 μl) of 95% deionized formamide and 10 mm EDTA. Samples (3 μl) were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C and resolved by electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea and 25% deionized formamide. Gels were exposed to a phosphor screen, and the radioactive bands were detected with a Typhoon 9400 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) and quantified with NIH ImageJ software. Steady-state kinetic parameters, Km, and Vmax values were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten model using KaleidaGraph (Version 4.1, Synergy). Primer extension reactions were performed similar to the single nucleotide incorporation/extension assays but in the presence of all four dNTPs in the reaction mixture. The concentrations of dNTPs used for various extension analyses are summarized in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4. The rate of exonuclease activity was determined using a polyacrylamide gel-based assay. Reactions mixtures (150 μl) contained 25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 nm radiolabeled substrate, 10 nm exonuclease-proficient pol γ, and 20 nm p55. Reactions were started by the addition of 5 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C and terminated by removing 10 μl of the mixture at different time points and adding it to tubes containing 10 μl of 95% deionized formamide and 10 mm EDTA. Gel electrophoresis and quantitation of radioactive bands were performed as described in the previous section. The rate of excision (kexo) of the 3′-primer terminus from each substrate was determined by plotting the loss of substrate against time (seconds) and fitting the data to a single-exponential using KaleidaGraph (Version 4.1, Synergy). Fluorescent substrates were prepared by hybridizing fluorescein-tagged primers to templates with or without T-T dimers. Immediately before use, the substrates were warmed to 37 °C for 5 min and held at room temperature. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy was measured with an Olis RSM1000 spectrofluorometer (Bogart, GA) equipped with a 1.24-mm slit and a temperature-controlled cell set to 22 °C as previously described (30.Longley M.J. Humble M.M. Sharief F.S. Copeland W.C.

Briefly, incident light at a 480-nm excitation wavelength was vertically plane-polarized and passed through a T-format quartz fluorometer cell, and fluorescence was measured at 2 identical detectors fitted with 520-nm high pass filters and vertical or horizontal polarizing filters. Binding mixtures (200 μl) contained 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaCl, and 15 nm concentration of the specified fluorescein-conjugated oligonucleotide substrate. Changes in fluorescence polarization were measured in response to the stepwise addition of purified exonuclease-deficient pol γ. Anisotropy data were collected in triplicate with a 5-s integration time, after a 20-s equilibration period after each addition. Changes in anisotropy were plotted against the total concentration of protein. To correct for the ligand depletion effect caused by non-trivial concentrations of protein-DNA complex relative to the total protein concentration, binding isotherms were fit to a quadratic equation by non-linear regression analysis to calculate apparent Kd(DNA) values (31.Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Application of fluorescence energy transfer and polarization to monitor Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein and lac promoter interaction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Intrinsic fluorescence of buffer components was undetectable at wavelengths relevant to fluorescein. The ability of human pol γ holoenzyme to bypass T-T in template DNA was tested on two substrates, either a 5′-end-labeled 27-mer or a 25-mer primer annealed to a 45-mer template containing a single thymine dimer pair. The control substrates contained templates with undamaged thymines in an otherwise same sequence context. The resulting substrates contain two adjacent thymines either in dimeric or free form as the first two template bases (when annealed with the 27-mer primer) and as the 3rd and 4th bases (when annealed with the 25-mer primer) that pol γ will encounter after binding to the 3′-end of the primer terminus. Extension reactions were performed with both the exonuclease-deficient (Fig. 1, lanes 1–16) and exonuclease-proficient (Fig. 1, lanes 17–32) DNA pol γ holoenzyme as described in “Experimental Procedures” using various concentrations of dNTPs. The results suggested that the exonuclease-deficient DNA pol γ could bypass the T-T on the template and completely extend the primer strand with reduced efficiency compared with extension of an undamaged template with both substrates (Fig. 1, compare lanes 2–4, with lanes 6–8, and lanes 10–12 with lanes 14–16). The addition of an extra nucleotide at the end of the synthesis in the substrates containing the T-T dimer could be due to the 1000-fold higher concentrations of dNTPs used in these extension reactions compared with the control substrates (Fig. 1, Lanes 7, 8, 15, and 16). The exonuclease-proficient DNA pol γ barely bypassed the T-T dimer in the template even at high dNTP concentrations irrespective of the substrate (Fig. 1, compare lanes 18–20 with lanes 22–24 and lanes 26–28 with lanes 30–32). The high concentration of dNTPs used by pol γ to bypass dimers in the template suggests that the enzyme might misincorporate nucleotides opposite this lesion. To investigate the nucleotide specificity of this apparent bypass event, single nucleotide incorporation assays were performed with the exonuclease-deficient pol γ using the same substrate described in the previous section, but this time only one of the four dNTPs was used in each reaction. The analysis revealed that pol γ could incorporate all four nucleotides opposite the undamaged thymine (Fig. 2, lanes 1–5). Although cognate base pairing was preferred based on steady-state kinetic analysis, pol γ incorporated guanine, cytosine, and thymine 200-, 10,100-, and 3,200-fold less efficiently compared with adenine opposite undamaged thymine in the template (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). The incorporation of nucleotides opposite the thymine dimer was significantly reduced (Fig. 2, lanes 6–10). Pol γ incorporated two adenines opposite the T-T ∼800-fold less efficiently compared with control (Table 1), primarily due to a ∼650-fold reduction in Km for dATP binding (compare Km values of dA incorporation for ND and T-T-containing templates in Table 1). Surprisingly, guanine was incorporated only ∼4-fold less efficiently than adenine opposite the 3′ but not 5′-thymine of the dimer (Fig. 2, compare lane 7 and 8; compare kcat/Km and relative efficiency (frel) for adenine versus guanine incorporation opposite T-T in Table 1), suggesting a possible role of pol γ in UV-induced mtDNA mutagenesis. Pol γ also incorporated pyrimidines opposite the 3′-thymine of the dimer but much less efficiently (Fig. 2, lanes 9 and 10; Table 1, kcat values of dC and dT incorporation opposite T-T in the template; supplemental Fig. 1).TABLE 1Steady-state kinetic parameters for nucleotide incorporation by exonuclease-deficient human pol γ opposite thymine dimers in DNA templateThymine in templateIncoming nucleotideKmKcatKcat/KmfcatDFμmmin−1NDdATP0.039 ± 0.0010.34 ± 0.038.7411dGTP7.8 ± 0.10.33 ± 0.000.040.005200dCTP198 ± 310.17 ± 0.010.00090.000110,100dTTP52 ± 40.14 ± 0.010.0030.00033,200T-TdATP26 ± 10.298 ± 0.0050.0111800dGTP100 ± 110.299 ± 0.0040.0030.272,900dCTP195 ± 140.043 ± 0.0050.00020.0239,800dTTP101 ± 20.057 ± 0.0060.00060.0515,600 Open table in a new tab Because pol γ preferred to incorporate purines opposite to the thymine dimers, three possible primer termini could exist during the bypass event. The 3′-end of the primer termini could contain either two adenines opposite the T-T or an adenine or a guanine opposite the 3′-thymine of the dimer (See Table 2). To determine whether these three primer termini were more or less recognized and degraded by the exonuclease activity opposite T-T dimers compared with undamaged thymines in template, exonuclease assays were performed using exonuclease-proficient DNA pol γ. The results from the analysis revealed that the excision rates (kexo) of all three primer termini increased only 1.1- 2.8-fold for substrates containing the T-T compared with undamaged thymines, suggesting that the incorporated purines were only moderately selected for digestion opposite T-T dimers relative to undamaged thymines (Table 2).TABLE 2Excision rate of various 3′-primer terminus opposite to the thymine dimers by exonuclease-proficient human DNA pol γDNA substrateThymine statekexoDFs−15′–AAND0.015 ± 0.0011.03′–TTGGG–T-T0.042 ± 0.0012.85′–AND0.010 ± 0.0011.03′–TTGGG–T-T0.021 ± 0.0022.25′–GND0.019 ± 0.0011.03′–TTGGG–T-T0.021 ± 0.0021.1 Open table in a new tab Next, we tested whether pol γ could perform extension past the T-T efficiently after incorporation of purines opposite the dimer. To determine the efficiency of extension past the three primer termini (mentioned in the previous section), single nucleotide extension assays were performed with exonuclease-deficient pol γ (Fig. 3 and Table 3). Steady-state kinetic analyses revealed that in the presence of two adenines opposite the dimer, extension past the lesion with cytosines was only 50-fold less efficient compared with the control substrate (Table 3 and supplemental Fig. 2). However, pol γ was 1,840-fold less efficient at incorporating an adenine opposite the 5′-thymine with an adenine already opposite the 3′-thymine of the damaged template compared with the undamaged template (Table 3). The catalytic efficiency of the polymerase also decreased 210-fold when incorporating an adenine opposite the 5′-thymine of the T-T after a misincorporated guanine opposite the 3′-thymine of the dimer when compared with non-damaged thymines in the template.TABLE 3Steady-state kinetic parameters for extension opposite to or past the thymine dimers by exonuclease-deficient human DNA pol γDNA substrateThymine stateIncoming nucleotideKmKcatKcat/KmDFμmmin−15′–AANDdCTP0.018 ± 0.0060.33 ± 0.0518.313′–TTGGG–T-T0.79 ± 0.130.31 ± 0.020.39505′–ANDdATP0.041 ± 0.0040.60 ± 0.0414.713′–TTGGG–T-T38 ± 30.30 ± 0.010.0081,8405′—GNDdATP0.25 ± 0.020.43 ± 0.041.713′–TTGGG–T-T43 ± 50.34 ± 0.020.008210 Open table in a new tab We tested the ability of the exonuclease-deficient human pol γ to perform primer extension on various 3′-end terminated primers annealed to dimer-containing templates. As suggested by our single nucleotide incorporation analysis and steady-state kinetics, pol γ could perform complete extension of all four primers with different efficiencies at various nucleotide concentrations (Fig. 4). An ∼1000-fold excess of dNTPs was required to observe noticeable amounts of full-length products for all translesion synthesis past either one or two bases of thymine dimers in comparison to the control substrates (Fig. 4, compare lanes 2–4 to 6–8, lanes 18–20 to 22–24, and lanes 26–28 to 30–32). However, when the 3′-end of the primer termini contained two adenines annealed to the thymine dimers of the template strand, pol γ extended significant quantities of the primer to full-length products in the presence of only a 50-fold excess of nucleotides as compared with the reactions containing undamaged templates (Fig. 4, compare lanes 10–12 to 14–16). This result in addition to the primer extension and steady-state kinetic analysis suggested that the major rate-limiting step in bypassing the thymine dimer lesions in mtDNA is the incorporation of nucleotides"
https://openalex.org/W2014429302,"Phagocytosis occurs primarily through two main processes in macrophages: the Fcγ receptor- and the integrin αMβ2-mediated processes. Complement C3bi-opsonized particles are known to be engulfed through integrin αMβ2-mediated process, which is regulated by RhoA GTPase. C3 toxin fused with Tat-peptide (Tat-C3 toxin), an inhibitor of the Rho GTPases, was shown to markedly inhibit the phagocytosis of serum (C3bi)-opsonized zymosans (SOZs). However, 8CPT-2Me-cAMP, an activator of exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac, Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor), restored the phagocytosis of the SOZs that was previously inhibited by the Tat-C3 toxin. In addition, a constitutively active form of Rap1 GTPase (CA-Rap1) also restored the phagocytosis that was previously reduced by a dominant negative form of RhoA GTPase (DN-RhoA). This suggests that Rap1 can replace the function of RhoA in the phagocytosis. Inversely, CA-RhoA rescued the phagocytosis that was suppressed by DN-Rap1. These findings suggest that both RhoA and Rap1 GTPases collectively regulate the phagocytosis of SOZs. In addition, filamentous actin was reduced by the Tat-C3 toxin, which was again restored by 8CPT-2Me-cAMP. Small interfering profilin suppressed the phagocytosis, suggesting that profilin is essential for the phagocytosis of SOZs. Furthermore, 8CPT-2Me-cAMP increased the co-immunoprecipitation of profilin with Rap1, whereas Tat-C3 toxin decreased that of profilin with RhoA. Co-immunoprecipitations of profilin with actin, Rap1, and RhoA GTPases were augmented in the presence of GTPγS rather than GDP. Therefore, we propose that both Rap1 and RhoA GTPases regulate the formation of filamentous actin through the interaction between actin and profilin, thereby collectively inducing the phagocytosis of SOZs in macrophages."

Here we report that cellular exposure to UV irradiation, camptothecin, or hydroxyurea induces accumulation of HDHB on chromatin in a dose- and time-dependent manner, preferentially in S phase cells. Replication stress-induced recruitment of HDHB to chromatin is independent of checkpoint signaling but correlates with the level of replication protein A (RPA) recruited to chromatin. We show using purified proteins that HDHB physically interacts with the N-terminal domain of the RPA 70-kDa subunit (RPA70N).

https://openalex.org/W1986373774,"Animal translocations are human-induced colonizations that can represent opportunities to contribute to the knowledge on the behavioral and demographic processes involved in the establishment of animal populations. Habitat selection behaviors, such as social cueing, have strong implications on dispersal and affect the establishment success of translocations. Using modeling simulations with a two-population network model (a translocated population and a remnant population), we investigated the consequences of four habitat selection strategies on post-translocation establishment probabilities in short- and long-lived species. Two dispersal strategies using social cues (conspecific attraction and habitat copying) were compared to random and quality-based strategies. We measured the sensitivity of local extinctions to dispersal strategies, life cycles, release frequencies, remnant population and release group sizes, the proportion of breeders and the connectivity between populations. Our results indicate that social behaviors can compromise establishment as a result of post-release dispersal, particularly in long-lived species. This behavioral mechanism, the ""vacuum effect"", arises from increased emigration in populations that are small relative to neighboring populations, reducing their rate of population growth. The vacuum effect can drive small remnant populations to extinction when a translocated group is large. In addition, the magnitude of the vacuum effect varies non-linearly with connectivity. The vacuum effect represents a novel form of the behaviorally mediated Allee effect that can cause unexpected establishment failures or population extinctions in response to social cueing. Accounting for establishment probabilities as a conditional step to the persistence of populations would improve the accuracy of predicting the fates of translocated or natural (meta)populations."

Intramembrane-cleaving proteases.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13969-13973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). I-CLiPs trigger a variety of cellular pathways leading either to degradation of transmembrane domains or to the liberation of peptides, which in some cases are required for nuclear signaling (2Fluhrer R.

In most, but not all cases, I-CLiPs are part of a two-step proteolytic cascade known as regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). The first step of RIP, commonly known as shedding, removes a large part of the substrates' ectodomain, which is secreted. In a subsequent step the remaining membrane-bound substrate is cleaved within its transmembrane domain (TMD) to produce an intracellular domain (ICD) and low molecular weight secreted peptides (2Fluhrer R.

Because their peptide bonds are hardly accessible to proteases, α-helical TMDs are expected to be poor protease substrates. To make TMDs susceptible to intramembrane proteolysis their helical content may be reduced by helix-destabilizing amino acids (15Hubbard S.J.

In line with these findings so far unknown determinants within a short luminal juxtamembrane sequence of the Bri2 protein as well as in the intracellular domain and the TMD are required for efficient intramembrane proteolysis by signal peptide peptidase-like 2b (SPPL2b) (27Martin L. Fluhrer R. Reiss K. Kremmer E. Saftig P. Haass C. Regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Bri2 (Itm2b) by ADAM10 and SPPL2a/SPPL2b.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1644-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To specify these determinants in more detail, we now investigated whether helix destabilizing amino acids in the TMD of Bri2 affect the efficiency of intramembrane proteolysis. We demonstrate that a single glycine residue in the N-terminal part of the Bri2 TMD (G60) is essential for the destabilization of the α-helical structure of the TMD and thus for its cleavage by SPPL2b. In contrast, the GXXXG motif affects intramembrane cleavage of Bri2 only to a minor extent. Consistent with these findings, Gly-60 is a major determinant of the secondary structure of the Bri2 TMD in lipid vesicles, while other potentially helix destabilizing residues within the TMD of Bri2 do not influence secondary structure and cleavage efficiency of Bri2.

Bri2 wt lacks the propeptide and carries an N-terminal Flag tag (DYKDDDK) and a C-terminal V5 tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) to detect Bri2 ICD species and the BRICHOS domain, respectively. The indicated mutations have been introduced using site-directed mutagenesis. Sequences of the respective oligonucleotides are available upon request. All cDNA constructs were sequenced for verification. Transient transfections of cells were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen GmbH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To induce expression of the SPPL2b constructs, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (BD Biosciences, San Jose) added to the cell culture medium for at least 48 h. The anti-HA-peroxidase coupled 3F10 antibody was obtained from Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). The monoclonal anti-Flag M2 and the polyclonal HA 6908 antibody were obtained from Sigma, the poly- and monoclonal V5 antibodies were purchased from Chemicon (Schwalbach, Germany) and Invitrogen GmbH, respectively. Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Promega. Immunoprecipitation assays were carried out as described previously (29Fluhrer R. Capell A. Westmeyer G. Willem M.

To detect Bri2 species in the cell lysate or BRICHOS in the conditioned media samples were separated on Tris-Tricine gels or 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, respectively. Proteins were subsequently transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon, Millipore Corporation, Eschborn, Germany) and detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence technique (ECL) Western blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). For quantification, proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (ECL) Plus Western blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare). The chemiluminescence signals of at least six independent experiments were measured with a CCD camera-based imaging system (ImageQuant LAS-4000 Fuji Film). Intensities of individual gels were normalized to one control experiment. Mean and S.D. of all individual experiments were determined. The relative signal intensity of ICD compared with Bri2 + Bri2 ICD of the respective sample was measured for the constructs indicated and set to 100% for Bri2 wt. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. Statistical significant p values <0.05, <0.005, or <0.0005 are represented by *, ** or ***, respectively. HEK293-EBNA cells were grown on polylysine-coated glass coverslips to 50–80% confluence. After transient transfection with the indicated Bri2 constructs, cells were fixed for 20 min with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized for 20 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS (were indicated) and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Incubations with the monoclonal V5 antibody were performed for 1 h at room temperature in PBS followed by incubation with Alexa 488-coupled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes).

The mixture was chilled in liquid nitrogen and subsequently lyophilized. The phospholipid-peptide mixtures were hydrated in buffer (100 mm KCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) for 15 min at 30 °C resulting in a final peptide concentration of ∼80 μm. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) were prepared by sonication of the phospholipid-peptide suspensions for ∼20 min under argon at temperatures of ∼5 °C above the respective transition temperature tm of the lipids. A Branson sonifier equipped with a microtip was employed, using a duty cycle of 30%. CD spectra were measured with a Jasco J-810 Spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Gross-Umstadt, Germany) using a cuvette with a path length of 0.1 cm. Spectra of 11 scans were averaged. CD data are expressed as the mean residue ellipticity (Θ) in deg cm2 dmol−1 at the respective wave length in nm. The mean residue ellipticity was calculated from the measured ellipticity (θ, in mdeg) by dividing the molar ellipticity (θ × 100/([Protein] × d), d is the cuvette path length in cm) by the amount of residues (n = 39 for all Bri2 peptides). The molecular weights of the peptides are indicated above. Bri2 (itm2b), the protein genetically involved in familial British dementia (31Vidal R. Frangione B. Rostagno A. Mead S. Révész T. Plant G.

The shedding event significantly facilitates subsequent intramembrane cleavage by SPPL2b (35Martin L. Fluhrer R. Haass C. Substrate requirements for SPPL2b-dependent regulated intramembrane proteolysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5662-5670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which generates a low molecular weight intracellular peptide (Bri2 ICD) and a secreted C-terminal peptide (Bri2 C-peptide; (Ref. 27Martin L. Fluhrer R. Reiss K. Kremmer E. Saftig P. Haass C. Regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Bri2 (Itm2b) by ADAM10 and SPPL2a/SPPL2b.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1644-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar and Fig. 1A)). The efficiency of Bri2 intramembrane cleavage depends on so far unknown determinants within the intracellular domain, the TMD, and in the luminal juxtamembrane domain of Bri2 (35Martin L. Fluhrer R. Haass C. Substrate requirements for SPPL2b-dependent regulated intramembrane proteolysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5662-5670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To further specify these determinants we first investigated, whether mutation of potential helix-destabilizing residues within the TMD of Bri2 affect its intramembrane cleavage by SPPL2b, as it has been suggested for S2P, rhomboid, and SPP substrates (18Ye J. Davé U.P. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Asparagine-proline sequence within membrane-spanning segment of SREBP triggers intramembrane cleavage by site-2 protease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sequence features of substrates required for cleavage by GlpG, an Escherichia coli rhomboid protease.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 1028-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For this purpose a Bri2 variant lacking all four glycine residues in its TMD (Bri2 GallA) was generated (Fig. 1B). Because no other potential helix-destabilizing residues are present in the Bri2 TMD, Bri2 GallA reflects a mutant lacking all potential helix destabilizers. Compared with wt Bri2 ICD production was strongly reduced when Bri2 GallA was co-expressed with SPPL2b (Fig. 1C). As expected ICD production from both Bri2 variants was fully blocked in cells expressing the catalytically inactive SPPL2b D421A (Fig. 1C). Quantification of ICD production relative to total Bri2 revealed a significant reduction to 42.4% ± 17.3% in Bri2 GallA-expressing cells (Fig. 1D). To ensure that the reduced ICD level is neither due to an enhanced proteosomal degradation nor to missorting of the Bri2 GallA substrate we treated cells co-expressing SPPL2b and either Bri2 wt or Bri2 GallA with 10 μm MG132 (Fig. 1E) and determined the subcellular localization of Bri2 by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1G), respectively. Inhibition of proteosomal degradation stabilized all Bri2 species, including Bri2 ICDs to a similar extent regardless whether Bri2 wt or Bri2 GallA was expressed (Fig. 1E). Moreover, ICD levels generated from Bri2 GallA in cells treated with MG132 were reduced to a similar extent as in nontreated cells (42.9% ± 16.3%; Fig. 1F). Cell surface transport of the Bri2 protein was not affected by the removal of glycine residues from the TMD as shown by immunofluorescence staining of nonpermeabilized cells (Fig. 1G). These findings therefore demonstrate that removal of all potential helix destabilizing residues from the TMD of Bri2 significantly reduces its intramembrane cleavage by SPPL2b. Because the removal of all glycine residues also disrupts the GXXXG dimerization motif in the TMD of Bri2, we next investigated whether a single point mutation in the GXXXG motif would be sufficient to copy the effect of the Bri2 GallA mutation on Bri2 ICD production. An alanine mutation of the first glycine residue in the GXXXG motif (G67A) did not significantly affect generation of the Bri2 ICD (92.1 ± 23.4%; p < 0.54; Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that the effect on intramembrane proteolysis observed in the Bri2 GallA mutation (Fig. 1) is not caused by the potential disruption of the GXXXG motif. Because it has been shown that glycine to isoleucine mutations in the GXXXG motif of APP affect its cleavage by γ-secretase to a much greater extent than glycine to alanine mutations (26Munter L.M. Voigt P. Harmeier A. Kaden D. Gottschalk K.E. Weise C. Pipkorn R. Schaefer M. Langosch D. Multhaup G.

https://openalex.org/W1979004369,"Background The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), a major pay-for-performance programme, was introduced into United Kingdom primary care in April 2004. The impact of this programme on disparities in health care remains unclear. This study examines the following questions: has this pay for performance programme improved the quality of care for coronary heart disease, stroke and hypertension in white, black and south Asian patients? Has this programme reduced disparities in the quality of care between these ethnic groups? Did general practices with different baseline performance respond differently to this programme? Methodology/Principal Findings Retrospective cohort study of patients registered with family practices in Wandsworth, London during 2007. Segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series was used to take into account the previous time trend. Primary outcome measures were mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Our findings suggest that the implementation of QOF resulted in significant short term improvements in blood pressure control. The magnitude of benefit varied between ethnic groups with a statistically significant short term reduction in systolic BP in white and black but not in south Asian patients with hypertension. Disparities in risk factor control were attenuated only on few measures and largely remained intact at the end of the study period. Conclusions/Significance Pay for performance programmes such as the QOF in the UK should set challenging but achievable targets. Specific targets aimed at reducing ethnic disparities in health care may also be needed."

A new method for RApid Molecular Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing (RAMAST) that can be applied directly to positive blood cultures was developed and evaluated. Methodology/Principal Findings Growth curves and antibiotic susceptibility of blood culture isolates (Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci and (facultative) aerobic Gram-negative rods) were determined by incubating diluted blood cultures with and without antibiotics, followed by a quantitative universal 16S PCR to detect the presence or absence of growth. Testing 114 positive blood cultures, RAMAST showed an agreement with microbroth dilution of 96.7% for Gram-negative rods, with a minor error (false-susceptibility with a intermediate resistant strain) rate of 1.9%, a major error (false resistance) rate of 0.8% and a very major error (false susceptibility) rate of 0.6%. Agreement for S.aureus was 97.9%, with a very major error rate of 2.1%. Enterococcus species showed 95.0% agreement, with a major error rate of 5.0%. These agreements are comparable with those of the Phoenix system. Starting from a positive blood culture, the test was completed within 9 hours. Conclusions/Significance This new rapid method for antibiotic susceptibility testing can potentially provide accurate results for most relevant bacteria commonly isolated from positive blood cultures in less time than routine methods."

IntroductionApoptosis is the major pathway of regulated cell death that has evolved to efficiently eliminate aged and damaged cells without compromising tissue architecture and functions. Apoptosis is crucial for normal organismal homeostasis, and dysregulation of this cell death mechanism has profound pathophysiologic consequences by modulating inflammatory responses and tumor progression (1.Akdis C.A.

Furthermore, several cytotoxic agents can trigger apoptosis by yet to be defined mechanisms, depending on activation of vesicle fluxes to endosomes and lysosomes (14.Landry M.C. Sicotte A.

Biol. 2003; 19: 493-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). SNARE proteins are located on both vesicle and target membranes, and by participating in specific trans-interactions, they bring two membranes into close opposition and create a fusion pore (19.Hong W. SNAREs and traffic.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 120-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 20.Malsam J. Kreye S. Söllner T.H. Membrane fusion. SNAREs and regulation.Cell Mol.

Biol. 2003; 19: 493-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed unanticipated connections between the SNARE machinery and apoptosis. For example, expression of several SNARE components was found to be regulated by key apoptotic molecules, such as p53 (22.Zhang Y. Shu L. Chen X. Syntaxin 6, a regulator of the protein trafficking machinery and a target of the p53 family, is required for cell adhesion and survival.J. Biol.

On the other hand, SNARE proteins themselves can either suppress or accelerate apoptosis (22.Zhang Y. Shu L. Chen X.

Cytol. 2001; 207: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells ubiquitously express two SNAP isoforms, α and γ, whereas expression of the third isoform, βSNAP, is limited to the brain (27.Andreeva A.V. Kutuzov M.A. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. A ubiquitous membrane fusion protein αSNAP. A potential therapeutic target for cancer, diabetes, and neurological disorders?.Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2006; 10: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). αSNAP acts as an adaptor protein that physically links SNAREs to a hexameric ATPase, N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF), thereby mediating disassembly and recycling of SNARE complexes (28.Barnard R.J. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Stimulation of NSF ATPase activity by α-SNAP is required for SNARE complex disassembly and exocytosis.J.

Kutuzov M.A. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. A ubiquitous membrane fusion protein αSNAP. A potential therapeutic target for cancer, diabetes, and neurological disorders?.Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2006; 10: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which may explain pleiotropic biological functions of this membrane fusion protein. Interestingly, αSNAP was recently implicated in regulation of cell survival because its overexpression protected cells from apoptosis induced by cytotoxic drugs (30.Nakajima K. Hirose H. Taniguchi M. Kurashina H. Arasaki K. Nagahama M. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M.

Knockdown of NAPA using short hairpin RNA sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin. Implications to overcome chemoresistance.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2010; 80: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, mechanisms underlying such antiapoptotic activity of αSNAP remain unknown. The present study was designed to dissect molecular events that mediate a prosurvival role of αSNAP in model epithelia. We report that loss of αSNAP functions induces epithelial cell apoptosis by mechanisms involving decreased expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein, impaired ER-Golgi communications, and disintegration of the Golgi.DISCUSSIONαSNAP is a key component of intracellular vesicle trafficking that mediates turnover of SNARE complexes, thereby ensuring the continuity of vesicle fusion (17.Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Analysis of regulated exocytosis in adrenal chromaffin cells. Insights into NSF/SNAP/SNARE function.BioEssays. 1998; 20: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27.Andreeva A.V.

Targets. 2006; 10: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The present study has revealed a novel role of this protein, which acts as an important positive regulator of epithelial cell survival. Such prosurvival activity was uncovered by siRNA-mediated depletion of αSNAP or expression of its dominant negative mutant, which triggered a marked apoptosis in different types of cultured epithelial cells (Figs. 1, 2, and 4). This phenomenon is consistent with previous reports that αSNAP overexpression increased epithelial cell resistance to the cytotoxic drugs staurosporin (30.Nakajima K. Hirose H. Taniguchi M. Kurashina H. Arasaki K. Nagahama M. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. Involvement of BNIP1 in apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum membrane fusion.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3216-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and cisplatin (31.Wu Z.Z. Chao C.C. Knockdown of NAPA using short hairpin RNA sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin. Implications to overcome chemoresistance.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2010; 80: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) in vitro. Furthermore, some indirect evidence points to a possible prosurvival role of αSNAP in vivo. For example, genetic deletion of its homolog in Drosophila results in embryonic lethality (61.Babcock M. Macleod G.T. Leither J. Pallanck L. Genetic analysis of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein function in Drosophila reveals positive and negative secretory roles.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3964-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Additionally, αSNAP hypomorphic hyh mice (62.Chae T.H. Kim S. Marz K.E. Hanson P.I. Walsh C.A. The hyh mutation uncovers roles for α Snap in apical protein localization and control of neural cell fate.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) are characterized by a significant loss of neuroepithelial cells (63.Ferland R.J. Batiz L.F. Neal J. Lian G. Bundock E. Lu J. Hsiao Y.C. Diamond R. Mei D. Banham A.H. Brown P.J. Vanderburg C.R. Joseph J. Hecht J.L. Folkerth R. Guerrini R. Walsh C.A. Rodriguez E.M. Sheen V.L. Disruption of neural progenitors along the ventricular and subventricular zones in periventricular heterotopia.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 497-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), which can be a consequence of increased apoptosis.The life cycle of the cell depends on a delicate balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic mechanisms. Disruption of such balance by either increasing proapoptotic signaling or decreasing antiapoptotic defense results in cell death (64.Reed J.C. Bcl-2 family proteins.Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the former mechanism plays no role in the decreased viability of αSNAP-depleted epithelial cells. Indeed, αSNAP knockdown did not stimulate expression of major prodeath proteins (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3 and supplemental Fig. 2), and Bax null and p53 null HCT116 cells retained the ability to respond to αSNAP depletion with a robust apoptosis (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Interestingly, a recent study has found that loss of αSNAP sensitized HEK 293 cells to cisplatin cytotoxicity by increasing cellular levels of Bax and p53 (31.Wu Z.Z. Chao C.C. Knockdown of NAPA using short hairpin RNA sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin. Implications to overcome chemoresistance.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2010; 80: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This indicates that αSNAP can modulate proapoptotic signaling in response to some external stimuli, but it does not serve as an obligate suppressor of steady-state expression and functions of Bax or p53 proteins.By contrast, our results highlight the decreased prosurvival Bcl-2 signaling as a crucial mechanism of epithelial cell death triggered by αSNAP knockdown. First, loss of αSNAP significantly decreased expression of Bcl-2 protein at the onset of apoptosis (Fig. 4A). Second, Bcl-2 inhibition alone induced a pronounced caspase-dependent death of SK-CO15 cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Finally, Bcl-2 overexpression attenuated αSNAP depletion-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4, D–F). To our best knowledge, this is the first evidence that implicates vesicle trafficking machinery in regulating expression and antiapoptotic activity of Bcl-2. Interestingly, the progressive loss of Bcl-2 after αSNAP knockdown cannot be explained by its diminished mRNA transcription or accelerated protein degradation (supplemental Fig. 3). We believe that this phenomenon reflects inhibited translation of Bcl-2 protein. Indeed, depletion of epithelial αSNAP resulted in a dramatic down-regulation of protein translational machinery, which involved key regulators of both 5′-m7G-cap-dependent translation initiation and an alternative initiation from so-called internal ribosome entry sites (data not shown). On the other hand, functionally active internal ribosome entry sites were found in the 5′-untranslated region of the Bcl-2 transcript (65.Sherrill K.W. Byrd M.P. Van Eden M.E. Lloyd R.E. BCL-2 translation is mediated via internal ribosome entry during cell stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29066-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation of Bcl-2 was shown to be essential for cancer cell survival (66.Marash L. Liberman N. Henis-Korenblit S. Sivan G. Reem E. Elroy-Stein O. Kimchi A. DAP5 promotes cap-independent translation of Bcl-2 and CDK1 to facilitate cell survival during mitosis.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 447-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to shed light on the regulation of Bcl-2 translation in αSNAP-depleted cells.We also found that disruption of the ER-Golgi trafficking and Golgi fragmentation represent important upstream events that mediate the decreased Bcl-2 expression and apoptosis in αSNAP-depleted cells. Thus, knockdown of αSNAP impaired normal cycling of the KDEL-R between these organelles (Fig. 5A) and caused a profound loss of the compact Golgi structure that preceded the onset of apoptosis (supplemental Fig. 4). Furthermore, pharmacological interruption of the Golgi-ER vesicle cycling by either BFA or Eer1 phenocopied the effects of αSNAP depletion on cell survival and Bcl-2 expression (Fig. 5, B and C). Although our study provides the first evidence that αSNAP is essential for the Golgi integrity in living cells, it is consistent with several published reports implicating αSNAP in the regulation of the Golgi and ER homeostasis. Indeed, αSNAP was previously identified as a molecular constituent of two major SNARE complexes controlling the bidirectional vesicle trafficking between the Golgi and the ER (41.Aoki T. Kojima M.

Willmann M. Wenzel D. Winter U. von Mollard G.F. Söling H.D. Members of a mammalian SNARE complex interact in the endoplasmic reticulum in vivo and are found in COPI vesicles.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 87: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). One complex involving syntaxin-5 mediates the direct (anterograde) ER to Golgi transport, whereas the other complex involving syntaxin-18 regulates the opposite retrograde vesicle trafficking from the Golgi to the ER (67.Jahn R. Scheller R.H. SNAREs. Engines for membrane fusion.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). Moreover, αSNAP was shown to be essential for fusion of ER-derived vesicles with the Golgi in a cell-free system (68.Peter F. Wong S.H. Subramaniam V.N. Tang B.L. Hong W. α-SNAP but not γ-SNAP is required for ER-Golgi transport after vesicle budding and the Rab1-requiring step but before the EGTA-sensitive step.J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2625-2633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these data explain why the loss of αSNAP severely disrupts the vesicle cycling between these two organelles, thereby impairing structure and functions of both the Golgi and the ER.Surprisingly, the prosurvival activity of αSNAP appeared to be independent of its major binding partner, NSF, because down-regulation of NSF neither decreased Bcl-2 expression nor induced epithelial cell apoptosis (Fig. 6). These results are consistent with a recent report that siRNA-mediated knockdown of NSF does not affect survival of HeLa cells (69.Joshi A. Garg H. Ablan S.D. Freed E.O. Evidence of a role for soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) machinery in HIV-1 assembly and release.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 29861-29871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) but contradict earlier observations of the defective ER-Golgi trafficking and induction of cell death after overexpression of an ATP hydrolysis-deficient (E329Q) NSF mutant (52.Dalal S. Rosser M.F. Cyr D.M. Hanson P.I. Distinct roles for the AAA ATPases NSF and p97 in the secretory pathway.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 70.Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. N-Ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein. A trimeric ATPase whose hydrolysis of ATP is required for membrane fusion.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). However, the E329Q NSF mutant was shown to act as a “substrate trap” due to its tight binding to αSNAP (52.Dalal S. Rosser M.F. Cyr D.M. Hanson P.I. Distinct roles for the AAA ATPases NSF and p97 in the secretory pathway.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Hence, it is reasonable to suggest that overexpression of this dominant negative form of NSF induces cell death by sequestering and inactivating αSNAP rather than by inhibiting NSF activity per se.In contrast to NSF, our results implicate its homolog, p97 ATPase, in regulating Golgi integrity, Bcl-2 expression, and epithelial cell survival (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7). This opens a possibility that apoptosis in αSNAP-depleted cells can be dependent on p97 inactivation. Although this hypothesis lacks direct proof, it is supported by much indirect evidence. For example, αSNAP and p97 are known to have common binding partners, syntaxin-5 and syntaxin-18 (43.Rabouille C. Kondo H. Newman R. Hui N. Freemont P. Warren G. Syntaxin 5 is a common component of the NSF- and p97-mediated reassembly pathways of Golgi cisternae from mitotic Golgi fragments in vitro.Cell. 1998; 92: 603-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 71.Kano F. Kondo H. Yamamoto A. Kaneko Y. Uchiyama K. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. Murata M. NSF/SNAPs and p97/p47/VCIP135 are sequentially required for cell cycle-dependent reformation of the ER network.Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 989-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); therefore, they may modulate each other's activity by competing for these interactions. Interestingly, loss of αSNAP significantly affected expression of key p97-binding proteins and altered normal localization of this ATPase (supplemental Fig. 7), all of which is likely to affect p97 activity.Although the exact sequence of events that links disruption of the ER-Golgi vesicle cycling and activation of the proapoptotic program in αSNAP-depleted cells remains to be investigated, the decreased Bcl-2 synthesis is likely to be a key step of this process (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7). This notion is consistent with previous reports revealing the functional interplay between membrane trafficking and protein synthetic machinery. Thus, stimulation of exocytosis by overexpression of certain components of the SNARE or exocyst complexes resulted in increased protein synthesis (72.Lipschutz J.H. Lingappa V.R. Mostov K.E. The exocyst affects protein synthesis by acting on the translocation machinery of the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 912-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), whereas BFA-dependent disruption of the vesicle trafficking severely impaired this process (74.Ripley C.R. Fant J. Bienkowski R.S. Brefeldin A inhibits degradation as well as production and secretion of collagen in human lung fibroblasts.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3677-3682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulators of membrane trafficking can modulate several steps of polypeptide chain processing at the ER, including ribosomal attachments to the ER membrane, translation initiation, and polypeptide translocation into the ER lumen (72.Lipschutz J.H. Lingappa V.R. Mostov K.E. The exocyst affects protein synthesis by acting on the translocation machinery of the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20954-20960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 73.Pulvirenti T. Giannotta M. Capestrano M. Capitani M. Pisanu A. Polishchuk R.S. San Pietro E.

Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 912-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).It is noteworthy that besides down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression, other Golgi-dependent mechanisms may contribute to the diminished survival of αSNAP-depleted epithelial cells. Thus, these cells were characterized by the decreased expression of Golgi BFA-sensitive guanidine nucleotide exchange factors GBF1, BIG1, and BIG2, whereas selective depletion of GBF1 in SK-CO15 cells induced Bcl-2-independent apoptosis (data not shown). On the other hand, our study ruled out the role of several known mechanisms responsible for generation of the proapoptotic signaling from the ER and the Golgi. For example, a component of the Golgi-ER SNARE machinery, BNIP1, was previously identified as a proapoptotic protein, whose activity can be neutralized by αSNAP binding (30.Nakajima K. Hirose H. Taniguchi M. Kurashina H. Arasaki K. Nagahama M. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. Involvement of BNIP1 in apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum membrane fusion.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3216-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, our data argue against the involvement of BNIP1 in apoptosis triggered by knockdown of αSNAP (Fig. 8). Furthermore, ER-derived apoptotic events are usually associated with induction of the ER stress due to abnormal accumulation of unprocessed proteins in the ER (6.Viana R.J. Fonseca M.B. Ramalho R.M. Nunes A.F. Rodrigues C.M. Organelle stress sensors and cell death mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases.CNS Neurol. Disord. Drug Targets. 2010; 9: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 57.Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Caspase-12 mediates endoplasmic-reticulum-specific apoptosis and cytotoxicity by amyloid-β.Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar). Although αSNAP-depleted SK-CO15 cells demonstrated some signs of the ER stress (Fig. 9A), our experiments with the enhancement or inhibition of this stress response do not support its involvement in apoptosis following αSNAP knockdown (Fig. 9, B–E). Finally, we did not find any evidence that loss of αSNAP triggers cell death by some other known mechanisms, such as cleavage of Golgi proteins p115, golgin-160, or GRASP65, activation of Golgi-resident caspase-2, increase in cytosolic calcium concentration, or enhancement of ceramide signaling (data not shown).In summary, our study reveals a novel role of αSNAP in regulating epithelial cell survival. This role is based on the αSNAP-dependent vesicle cycling between the Golgi and the ER, which is critical for normal structure of these compartments and their ability to generate the antiapoptotic defense. Such a novel role for αSNAP can be essential for human diseases where loss or dysfunctions of this membrane fusion regulator may result in excessive cell death and disruption of normal tissue architecture. IntroductionApoptosis is the major pathway of regulated cell death that has evolved to efficiently eliminate aged and damaged cells without compromising tissue architecture and functions. Apoptosis is crucial for normal organismal homeostasis, and dysregulation of this cell death mechanism has profound pathophysiologic consequences by modulating inflammatory responses and tumor progression (1.Akdis C.A. Blaser K. Akdis M. Apoptosis in tissue inflammation and allergic disease.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 2.Cotter T.G. Apoptosis and cancer.

Apoptosis and caspases regulate death and inflammation in sepsis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Either external or internal signaling pathways activate the apoptotic cascade. The external pathway is triggered by death receptors at the plasma membrane (4.Guicciardi M.E. Gores G.J. Life and death by death receptors.FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1625-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), whereas the internal pathway is typically instigated from mitochondria or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 3The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumBFAbrefeldin AEer1eeyarestatin 1KDEL-RKDEL receptorNSFN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factorPARPpoly(ADP ribose) polymerasePIpropidium iodideSNAPsoluble NSF attachment proteinSNAREsoluble NSF attachment protein receptorJAM-Ajunctional adhesion molecule ApAbpolyclonal antibodyZbenzyloxycarbonylfmkfluoromethyl ketone.

In this study, we show that HIC1 is a direct transcriptional repressor of β-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2). Through promoter luciferase activity, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and sequential ChIP experiments, we demonstrate that ADRB2 is a direct target gene of HIC1, endogenously in WI-38 cells and following HIC1 re-expression in breast cancer cells. Agonist-mediated stimulation of ADRB2 increases the migration and invasion of highly malignant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells but these effects are abolished following HIC1 re-expression or specific down-regulation of ADRB2 by siRNA treatment. Our results suggest that early inactivation of HIC1 in breast carcinomas could predispose to stress-induced metastasis through up-regulation of the β-2 adrenergic receptor."

Here we present an extendible framework based on the open-source image analysis software ImageJ, which aims in particular at analyzing the expression of fluorescent reporters through cell divisions. The ability to track individual cell lineages is essential for the analysis of gene regulatory factors involved in the control of cell fate and identity decisions. In our approach, cell nuclei are identified using Hoechst, and a characteristic drop in Hoechst fluorescence helps to detect dividing cells. We first compare the efficiency and accuracy of different segmentation methods and then present a statistical scoring algorithm for cell tracking, which draws on the combination of various features, such as nuclear intensity, area or shape, and importantly, dynamic changes thereof. Principal component analysis is used to determine the most significant features, and a global parameter search is performed to determine the weighting of individual features. Our algorithm has been optimized to cope with large cell movements, and we were able to semi-automatically extract cell trajectories across three cell generations. Based on the MTrackJ plugin for ImageJ, we have developed tools to efficiently validate tracks and manually correct them by connecting broken trajectories and reassigning falsely connected cell positions. A gold standard consisting of two time-series with 15,000 validated positions will be released as a valuable resource for benchmarking. We demonstrate how our method can be applied to analyze fluorescence distributions generated from mouse stem cells transfected with reporter constructs containing transcriptional control elements of the Msx1 gene, a regulator of pluripotency, in mother and daughter cells. Furthermore, we show by tracking zebrafish PAC2 cells expressing FUCCI cell cycle markers, our framework can be easily adapted to different cell types and fluorescent markers."

While exploring signaling events that occur downstream of iPLA2β activation, we found that p38 MAPK is activated by phosphorylation in INS-1 insulinoma cells and mouse pancreatic islets, that this increases with iPLA2β expression level, and that it is stimulated by the iPLA2β reaction product arachidonic acid. The insulin secretagogue d-glucose also stimulates β-cell p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and this is prevented by the iPLA2β inhibitor bromoenol lactone.

https://openalex.org/W2063955614,"Background Psychological outcome measures are evolving into measures that depict progress over time. Interval measurement during therapy has not previously been reported for a patient-generated measure in primary care. We aimed to determine the sensitivity to change throughout therapy, using ‘PSYCHLOPS’ (Psychological Outcome Profiles), and to determine if new problems appearing during therapy diminish overall improvement. Methods Responses to PSYCHLOPS, pre-, during- and post-therapy were compared. Setting: patients offered brief cognitive behaviour therapy in primary care in Poland. Results 238 patients completed the pre-therapy questionnaire, 194 (81.5%) the during-therapy questionnaire and 142 the post-therapy questionnaire (59.7%). For those completing all three questionnaires (n = 135), improvement in total scores produced an overall Effect Size of 3.1 (2.7 to 3.4). We estimated change using three methods for dealing with missing values. Single and multiple imputation did not significantly change the Effect Size; ‘Last Value Carried Forward’, the most conservative method, produced an overall Effect Size of 2.3 (1.9 to 2.6). New problems during therapy were reported by 81 patients (60.0%): new problem and original problem scores were of similar magnitude and change scores were not significantly different when compared to patients who did not report new problems. Conclusion A large proportion of outcome data is lost when outcome measures depend upon completed end of therapy questionnaires. The use of a during-therapy measure increases data capture. Missing data still produce difficulties in interpreting overall effect sizes for change. We found no evidence that new problems appearing during therapy hampered overall recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2127119927,"Background Oral polymicrobial interactions and biofilm formation are associated with initiation and progression of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. Transcriptome studies of such interactions, allowing a first mechanistic insight, are hampered by current single-species array designs. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we used 385 K NimbleGene™ technology for design and evaluation of an array covering the full genomes of 5 important physiological-, cariogenic-, and periodontitis-associated microorganisms (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis). Array hybridization was done with cDNA from cultures grown for 24 h anaerobically. Single species experiments identified cross-species hybridizing array probes. These probes could be neglected in a mixed-species experimental setting without the need to exclude the whole genes from the analysis. Between 69% and almost 99% of the genomes were actively transcribed under the mono-species planktonic, monolayer, and biofilm conditions. The influence of Streptococcus mitis (not represented on the array) on S. mutans gene transcription was determined as a test for a dual-species mixed biofilm setup. Phenotypically, under the influence of S. mitis an increase in S. mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media pH-value were noticed, thereby confirming previously published data. Employing a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 S. mutans transcripts were identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance compared to a S. mutans mono-species biofilm. Several of these genes have previously been found differentially regulated under general and acid stress, thereby confirming the value of this array. Conclusions/Significance This new array allows transcriptome studies on multi-species oral biofilm interactions. It may become an important asset in future oral biofilm and inhibitor/therapy studies."
https://openalex.org/W2139807762,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that is elevated in a variety of human cancers. While FAK is implicated in many cellular processes that are perturbed in cancer, including proliferation, actin and adhesion dynamics, polarisation and invasion, there is only some limited information regarding the role of FAK in radiation survival. We have evaluated whether FAK is a general radio-sensitising target, as has been suggested by previous reports. We used a clean genetic system in which FAK was deleted from mouse squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells (FAK -/-), and reconstituted with exogenous FAK wild type (wt). Surprisingly, the absence of FAK was associated with increased radio-resistance in advanced SCC cells. FAK re-expression inhibited p53-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of p21, and a sub-set of other p53 target genes involved in DNA repair, after treatment with ionizing radiation. Moreover, p21 depletion promoted radio-sensitisation, implying that FAK-mediated inhibition of p21 induction is responsible for the relative radio-sensitivity of FAK-proficient SCC cells. Our work adds to a growing body of evidence that there is a close functional relationship between integrin/FAK signalling and the p53/p21 pathway, but demonstrates that FAK's role in survival after stress is context-dependent, at least in cancer cells. We suggest that there should be caution when considering inhibiting FAK in combination with radiation, as this may not always be clinically advantageous."
https://openalex.org/W2148149911,"Autoimmune uveitis is an intraocular inflammation that arises through autoreactive T-cells attacking the inner eye, eventually leading to blindness. However, the contributing molecular pathomechanisms within the affected tissues remain as yet elusive. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a highly dynamic structure that varies tremendously and influences the encompassing tissue. In order to assess ECM re-modeling in autoimmune uveitis, we investigated the expression of ECM molecules fibronectin and osteopontin in vitreous and retina samples. This was carried out in the only spontaneous animal model for human autoimmue uveitis, namely equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) that resembles the human disease in clinical as well as in immunopathological aspects. ERU is a naturally occurring autoimmune disease in horses that develops frequently and has already proved its value to study disease-related pathomechanisms. Western blot analysis of fibronectin and osteopontin in healthy and uveitic vitreous revealed significant reduction of both proteins in uveitis. Immunohistochemical expression of fibronectin in healthy retinas was restricted to the inner limiting membrane abutting vimentin positive Müller cell endfeet, while in uveitic sections, a disintegration of the ILM was observed changing the fibronectin expression to a dispersed pattern extending toward the vitreous. Retinal expression of osteopontin in control tissue was found in a characteristic Müller cell pattern illustrated by co-localization with vimentin. In uveitic retinas, the immunoreactivity of osteopontin in gliotic Müller cells was almost absent. The ability of Müller cells to express fibronectin and osteopontin was additionally shown by immunocytochemistry of primary cultured equine Müller cells and the equine Müller cell line eqMC-7. In conclusion, severe ECM re-modeling in autoimmune uveitis reported here, might affect the adhesive function of fibronectin and thus the anchoring of Müller cell endfeet to the ILM. Furthermore, the absence of osteopontin in gliotic Müller cells might represent reduced neuroprotection, an osteopontin attribute that is intensively discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2027555709,"Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy with a wide PrPres dissemination in many non-neural tissues and with high levels of transmissibility within susceptible populations. Mechanisms of transmission are incompletely understood. It is generally assumed that it is horizontally transmitted by direct contact between animals or indirectly through the environment, where scrapie can remain infectious for years. In contrast, in utero vertical transmission has never been demonstrated and has rarely been studied. Recently, the use of the protein misfolding cyclic amplification technique (PMCA) has allowed prion detection in various tissues and excretions in which PrPres levels have been undetectable by traditional assays. The main goal of this study was to detect PrPres in fetal tissues and the amniotic fluid from natural scrapie infected ewes using the PMCA technique. Six fetuses from three infected pregnant ewes in an advanced clinical stage of the disease were included in the study. From each fetus, amniotic fluid, brain, spleen, ileo-cecal valve and retropharyngeal lymph node samples were collected and analyzed using Western blotting and PMCA. Although all samples were negative using Western blotting, PrPres was detected after in vitro amplification. Our results represent the first time the biochemical detection of prions in fetal tissues, suggesting that the in utero transmission of scrapie in natural infected sheep might be possible."

In this study, we examined the effects, the structural determinants, and the underlying mechanisms of heparin-induced leukocytosis, a side effect occurring in 0.44% of patients receiving heparin. We observed that heparin induced both lymphocytosis and neutrophilia, and the effects required heparin to be 6-O-sulfated but did not require its anticoagulant activity. Cell mobilization studies revealed that the lymphocytosis was attributable to a combination of blockage of lymphocyte homing and the release of thymocytes from the thymus, whereas the neutrophilia was caused primarily by neutrophil release from the bone marrow and demargination in the vasculature. Mechanistic studies revealed that heparin inhibits L- and P-selectin, as well as the chemokine CXCL12, leading to leukocytosis. Heparin is known to require 6-O-sulfate to inhibit L- and P-selectin function, and in this study we observed that 6-O-sulfate is required for its interaction with CXCL12.

Fibbe W.E. Van Damme J. The molecular basis of leukocytosis.Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 182-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Based on the type of leukocyte that accumulates, leukocytosis is further subcategorized as neutrophilia, lymphocytosis, monocytosis, eosinophilia, and basophilia (1.Opdenakker G. Fibbe W.E. Van Damme J. The molecular basis of leukocytosis.Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 182-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Clinically, leukocytosis is most commonly caused by neutrophilia, less often caused by lymphocytosis, and rarely is a consequence of monocytosis, eosinophilia, or basophilia (1.Opdenakker G. Fibbe W.E. Van Damme J. The molecular basis of leukocytosis.Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 182-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 2.Abramson N. Melton B. Leukocytosis. Basics of clinical assessment.Am. Fam. Physician. 2000; 62: 2053-2060PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanistic studies have shown that leukocytosis can be attributed to an increase in cell production, an increase in cell release from storage pools, demargination in the vasculature, and/or decreased egress into target tissues. Many molecules that play key roles in inflammation have been implicated in leukocytosis, notably selectins, chemokines, integrins, and proteases (1.Opdenakker G. Fibbe W.E. Van Damme J. The molecular basis of leukocytosis.Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 182-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some medications also induce leukocytosis, including corticosteroids, lithium, β-agonists, and heparin (2.Abramson N. Melton B. Leukocytosis. Basics of clinical assessment.Am. Fam.

Heparin, a linear polysaccharide that belongs to the family of glycosaminoglycans, has been used clinically as an anticoagulant/antithrombotic for more than 70 years. It consists of repeating disaccharide units containing a uronic acid and a glucosamine residue that is either N-sulfated, N-acetylated, or occasionally unsubstituted (6.Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Order out of chaos. Assembly of ligand-binding sites in heparan sulfate.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). The disaccharides may be further O-sulfated at C6 or C3 of the glucosamine residues and C2 of the uronic acid residues. The potent antithrombotic activity of heparin depends on the specific arrangement of sulfated sugar units and uronic acid epimers, which form a binding site for antithrombin III (6.Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Order out of chaos. Assembly of ligand-binding sites in heparan sulfate.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Heparin also possesses a variety of non-anticoagulant functions such as inhibition of inflammation and tumor metastasis (7.Nelson R.M. Cecconi O. Roberts W.G. Aruffo A. Linhardt R.J. Bevilacqua M.P. Heparin oligosaccharides bind L- and P-selectin and inhibit acute inflammation.Blood. 1993; 82: 3253-3258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Borsig L. Wong R. Feramisco J. Nadeau D.R. Varki N.M.

Lymphocytosis produced by heparin and other sulfated polysaccharides in mice and rats.Cell. Immunol. 1974; 14: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4.Godlowski Z.Z.

Importantly, from a clinical perspective, 0.44% of patients develop leukocytosis when taking therapeutic doses of heparin. In the United States more than 12 million patients receive heparin every year (10.Fahey V.A. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.J. Vasc. Nurs. 1995; 13: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), resulting in over 50,000 cases per year and indicating that heparin-induced leukocytosis (HIL) 2The abbreviations used are:HILheparin-induced leukocytosisBMbone marrowBWbody weightN-desN-desulfateddes-hepdesulfated heparinCR-hepcarboxyl-reduced heparinCFSEcarboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl esterSPRsurface plasmon resonanceHPChematopoietic progenitor cell. is a frequently seen side effect of the drug in hospitals. However, the structural determinants of heparin that cause HIL and the mechanisms behind the effect remain unknown. heparin-induced leukocytosis bone marrow body weight N-desulfated desulfated heparin carboxyl-reduced heparin carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester surface plasmon resonance hematopoietic progenitor cell. In this study, we observed that heparin induced both lymphocytosis and neutrophilia, and the effect required 6-O-sulfation of the glucosamine residues but did not require its anticoagulant activity. Cell mobilization studies revealed that the lymphocytosis was attributable to the blockage of lymphocyte homing and release of thymocytes, whereas the neutrophilia was mainly caused by neutrophil release from bone marrow (BM) and demargination in the vasculature. Molecular mechanism studies revealed that heparin inhibits L- and P-selectin- and chemokine CXCL12-mediated leukocyte trafficking, resulting in HIL. Porcine intestinal heparin (average mass = 12,000–15,000 Da) was obtained from Scientific Protein Laboratories (Milwaukee, WI). Heparinoids were prepared as reported previously (9.Wang L. Brown J.R. Varki A. Esko J.D. Heparin's anti-inflammatory effects require glucosamine 6-O-sulfation and are mediated by blockade of L- and P-selectins.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), including N-desulfated/N-acetylated heparin (N-des), 2-O/3-O-desulfated heparin (2/3-des-hep), N-/2-O/3-O-desulfated heparin (N/2/3-des-hep), 6-O-desulfated heparin (6-des-hep), and carboxyl-reduced heparin (CR-hep) (Fig. 2A). The heparin had an anti-factor Xa activity of 149 units/mg, whereas all heparinoids had no detectable anti-factor Xa activity. The heparin and heparinoids were negative for endotoxin. Wild-type, P-selectin knock-out (P−/−), and L-selectin knock-out (L−/−) mice, and P- and L-selectin double knock-out (PL−/−) mice on a C57BL/6J background were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The α(1,3)-fucosyltransferase-IV and -VII double knock-out (FucT-IV/VII−/−) mice were kindly provided by Dr. John B. Lowe (11.Weninger W. Ulfman L.H. Cheng G. Souchkova N. Quackenbush E.J. Lowe J.B. von Andrian U.H.

Mice were housed at a specific pathogen-free facility, and the experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Georgia. Previous studies showed that a single bolus injection of sulfated polysaccharide fucoidan (i.v., 1.25–2.5 mg/25 g BW) induced robust leukocytosis in mice and that the leukocytosis peaked at 1.5 h after the fucoidan injection and coincided with reduced CXCL12 concentration in BM (12.Sweeney E.A. Lortat-Jacob H. Priestley G.V. Nakamoto B. Papayannopoulou T. Sulfated polysaccharides increase plasma levels of SDF-1 in monkeys and mice. Involvement in mobilization of stem/progenitor cells.Blood. 2002; 99: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycan mimetics injected intraperitoneally at 1.25 mg/25 g BW similarly induced leukocytosis (13.Albanese P. Caruelle D. Frescaline G. Delbé J. Petit-Cocault L. Huet E. Charnaux N. Uzan G. Papy-Garcia D. Courty J. Glycosaminoglycan mimetics-induced mobilization of hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells into mouse peripheral blood. Structure/function insights.Exp. Hematol. 2009; 37: 1072-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our pilot study showed that the CXCL12 concentration in BM bottomed out at 90 min after heparin injection (Fig. 6, B and C). Considering that heparin at 0.5–1.25 mg/25 g BW potently blocks selectin-mediated leukocyte trafficking in mice (9.Wang L. Brown J.R. Varki A. Esko J.D. Heparin's anti-inflammatory effects require glucosamine 6-O-sulfation and are mediated by blockade of L- and P-selectins.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and that disruption of CXCL12 signaling in BM and selectin functions may represent the major molecular mechanisms underlying HIL, we rationalized injecting i.v. heparin at 1 mg/25 g BM, a dose close to glycosaminoglycan mimetics and fucoidan administration (12.Sweeney E.A. Lortat-Jacob H. Priestley G.V. Nakamoto B. Papayannopoulou T. Sulfated polysaccharides increase plasma levels of SDF-1 in monkeys and mice.

Hematol. 2009; 37: 1072-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and we used 90 min post-heparin injection as the time point for HIL analysis in our studies. In brief, mice at 8–10 weeks old were injected i.v. via tail vein with the heparinoids at 1 mg/25 g BW. Blood samples were taken from the retroorbital plexus during isoflurane anesthesia 90 min after heparinoid injection. Total leukocytes were counted separately by two investigators using hemocytometers. The leukocyte subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry (9.Wang L. Brown J.R. Varki A. Esko J.D.

The percentage of lymphocyte in leukocyte population was quantified based on forward and right angle light scattering in the cytogram. B cells and NK cells were counted following staining with FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD45R/B220 and pan-NK antibodies, respectively. The subpopulations of T cells were determined by quantifying CD4+/CD8−, CD4−/CD8+, and CD4+/CD8+ cells. For some studies, the mice were preinjected with anti-CXC12-neutralizing antibody (12.Sweeney E.A. Lortat-Jacob H. Priestley G.V. Nakamoto B. Papayannopoulou T.

Lymphocyte suspensions from peripheral lymph nodes were prepared in DMEM, and erythrocytes were lysed with a 0.83% NH4Cl solution. After washing with PBS, the cells (5–10 × 106 cells/ml) were labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE, 5 μm) (9.Wang L. Brown J.R. Varki A. Esko J.D. Heparin's anti-inflammatory effects require glucosamine 6-O-sulfation and are mediated by blockade of L- and P-selectins.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Heparin at 1 mg/25 g BW in 100 μl of saline or only saline was injected into the tail vein of the recipient mice. Five min later, 7 × 106 CFSE-labeled cells in 100 μl of saline were similarly injected. Ninety minutes after heparin administration, the mice were sacrificed. Peripheral blood and single cell suspensions prepared from peripheral (cervical and axillary) and mesenteric lymph nodes were counted, and the percentage of CFSE+ cells was determined by flow cytometry. The chests of anesthetized mice were opened; 10 μl of FITC (Sigma) at 600 μg/ml in PBS was injected directly into each thymic lobe with a 28-gauge needle, and then the chests were closed with surgical clips in the overlying skin (15.Scollay R.G.

Immunol. 1980; 10: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). This method labeled 30% of the thymocytes in the thymus. Thirty minutes after intrathymic injection, mice received heparin at 1 mg/25 g BW or only PBS via tail vein injection. Ninety minutes later, the FITC+ cells in the circulation were quantified by flow cytometry. The total of thymocytes released from the thymus was calculated as the (number of FITC+ cells)/(30%). Mice were injected with 0.6 mg of BrdU i.p. twice, separated by 12 h (16.Horwitz B.H. Mizgerd J.P. Scott M.L. Doerschuk C.M.

At 24 h after the first injection, 35% Gr-1+-BM cells were labeled with BrdU, and the mice were injected with heparin at 1 mg/25 g BW in 100 μl of saline or saline only via tail vein. Ninety min later, blood was collected, and total leukocytes were counted. The Gr-1+/BrdU+ cells were quantified by flow cytometry, and the neutrophils released from the BM were calculated as (Gr-1+/BrdU+ cells)/35%. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.6 mg of BrdU daily for 7 days at which point all neutrophils in circulation were BrdU+ (19.Nakagawa M. Terashima T. D'yachkova Y. Bondy G.P.

Fresh blood was collected into citrate-containing tubes, washed with PBS, and then transfused to the recipient mice at 150 μl/mouse via tail vein. Thirty min after the transfusion, heparin at 1 mg/25 g BW in 100 μl of saline or saline only was injected similarly. Ninety min after the heparin/saline administration, the Gr-1+ and BrdU+/Gr-1+ cells in the peripheral blood were quantified by leukocyte count and flow cytometry. CXCL12α and CXCL12β levels in mouse plasma and BM were determined by ELISA using monoclonal antibodies specific for CXCL12β (BAF351) or CXCL12α (BAF310) with capture antibody MAB350 and recommended protocols from R&D Systems (12.Sweeney E.A. Lortat-Jacob H. Priestley G.V. Nakamoto B. Papayannopoulou T. Sulfated polysaccharides increase plasma levels of SDF-1 in monkeys and mice. Involvement in mobilization of stem/progenitor cells.Blood. 2002; 99: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). BM samples were prepared by flushing the content of two femurs directly into 0.4 ml of sample buffer (0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 in 20 mm Trizma (Tris base), 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3) and centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected and used for CXCL12 concentration determination. Transendothelial cell migration was performed using trans-wells containing 3-μm pore-polycarbonate filters to separate the upper and lower chambers in 24-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) (20.Netelenbos T. Zuijderduijn S. Van Den Born J. Kessler F.L. Zweegman S. Huijgens P.C. Dräger A.M. Proteoglycans guide SDF-1-induced migration of hematopoietic progenitor cells.J.

The integrity of the endothelium-covered trans-wells was controlled after each migration by May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining and followed by visualization by microscopy. BM cells were freshly prepared in single cell suspensions from mouse femurs and tibias by flushing in PBS. Red blood cells were lysed with 0.83% NH4Cl solution before rinsing. The BM cells were added at 1 × 105 cells per upper compartment. The migration was initiated by supplying CXCL12α (10 ng/ml) in the lower chamber to determine CXCL12-induced chemotaxis. Only the active migrating cells were able to get through the pores and into the lower chamber. After 4 h, cells that migrated into the lower chamber were counted. To determine whether heparin inhibits the CXCL12-induced transendothelial chemotaxis of BM cells, the experiment was similarly carried out with heparin added in the upper and lower chambers prior to initiation of cell migration. In additional experiments to determine the effect of immobilized CXCL12 on random migration of BM cells (chemokinesis), CXCL12α was preincubated at both apical and basal sides of endothelial cell-covered trans-wells for 30 min at RT. Nonbound CXCL12α was washed away by rinsing with PBS, and the transendothelial cell migration experiments were carried out as described above. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells plated at 104 cells/well in 96-well tissue culture plates were grown in EMB-2 media supplemented with growth factors and 2% FBS according to the supplier's recommendations (Lonza Inc., Walkersville, MD) until confluency. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT and washed in PBS. After fixation, some wells were incubated with a mixture of heparinases I–III (20–50 milliunits/ml of each enzyme) for 1 h at RT. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS, and the cells were then incubated with CXCL12α at 10 μg/ml in PBS with or without heparin, heparan sulfate, or heparinoid at 20 μg/ml each for 1.5 h at RT. Bound CXCL12α was detected by incubation with a mouse anti-CXCL12 IgG antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and then with an HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and finally with the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine chromogen (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The absorbance at 450 nm was read using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Inc., Menlo Park, CA) equipped with Softmax software. SPR analyses were conducted using a BIACORE T100 apparatus (Biacore AB, Piscataway, NJ) with biotinylated heparin immobilized on streptavidin-coated chips. Biotinylated heparin was prepared using a two-stage procedure with biotin coupled at the reducing end of heparin (24.Osmond R.I. Kett W.C. Skett S.E. Coombe D.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23916-23925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The biotinylated heparin carried 1.3 biotin/heparin and was immobilized on streptavidin-coated CM5 chip surface. Briefly, the surface of a CM5 chip was activated by injecting a freshly prepared mixture (1:1) of N-hydroxysuccinimide (50 mm in water) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (200 mm in water) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, followed by a 21-min injection of streptavidin (400 mg/ml). Any remaining activated carboxylic acid groups were blocked by incubation with 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.6, for 21 min. Approximately 1000 response units of streptavidin was coupled to the cell surface using this method. Heparin immobilization was achieved by injecting biotinylated heparin at 1 ml/min for 21 min over the streptavidin-coated surface and was optimized to give ∼500 response units. As a reference surface for refractive index and correction of nonspecific binding, a second flow cell was treated in the same manner as above, but without the injection of biotinylated heparin. To determine the interaction of CXCL12α with heparinoids, CXCL12α (125 nm) was premixed with heparin (1 μg/ml) or 6-des-hep (1 μg/ml) in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% v/v surfactant P20) at RT. The mixture was immediately injected at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. CXCL12α (125 nm) was used as a positive control, whereas HBS-EP buffer alone was background control. Data were collected with a contact time of 120 s and a dissociation time of 300 s. The response unit for binding was presented with the background response subtracted. Data were evaluated using BIAevaluation Software 3.1, Biacore. Heparin has been reported to cause rapid and transient lymphocytosis in humans, cows, rats, and mice after i.p or i.v. injection (3.Bradfield J.W. Born G.V. Lymphocytosis produced by heparin and other sulfated polysaccharides in mice and rats.Cell. Immunol. 1974; 14: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4.Godlowski Z.Z.

Inhibition of lymphocyte recirculation by heparin.Nature. 1969; 222: 1183-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); however, the effect on subpopulations of leukocytes has not been defined. We examined the subpopulation distribution of circulating leukocytes 90 min after heparin treatment in mice. Compared with saline, heparin increased all major subpopulations of leukocytes in the circulation, including neutrophils (4.27 × 106/ml, 4.4-fold), lymphocytes (6.47 × 106/ml, 2.7-fold), and monocytes (0.37 × 106/ml, 2.1-fold) (Fig. 1). An analysis of the lymphocyte subpopulations showed the same tendency with the following results: B lymphocytes (2.24 × 106/ml, 1.9-fold), CD4+/CD8− (2.91 × 106/ml, 4.6-fold), CD4−/CD8+ (1.53 × 106/ml, 3.9-fold), and CD4+/CD8+ (0.06 × 106/ml, 12.5-fold) (Fig. 1). Lymphocytes and neutrophils were the two major subpopulations of circulating leukocytes and accounted for ∼62 and 33% of HIL cell population, respectively. To determine the structure required for heparin to induce leukocytosis, we treated mice with structurally different heparins (Fig. 2A). Compared with heparin, N-des-hep and 2/3-des-hep induced attenuated responses, whereas N/2/3-des-hep was unable to induce leukocytosis, indicating that HIL depended on the degree of sulfation (Fig. 2, B–D). Intriguingly, 6-des-hep was also unable to induce leukocytosis (Fig. 2, B–D). Heparin carries more N-sulfate than 6-O-sulfate, implying that the inefficacy of 6-des-hep to induce leukocytosis was not due to a reduction in the overall degree of sulfation, but specifically to the lack of 6-O-sulfate, revealing that heparin uniquely requires 6-O-sulfation to induce leukocytosis. CR-hep induced attenuated HIL response too, showing that the presence of the carboxyl moiety is also required for heparin to induce leukocytosis (Fig. 2, B–D). Intriguingly, subpopulation analysis observed that CR-hep had a slightly reduced efficacy for inducing neutrophilia, but its ability to cause lymphocytosis was abrogated (Fig. 2, C and D), highlighting that heparin requires carboxyl moiety to induce lymphocytosis but not neutrophilia. Furthermore, N-des-hep, 2/3-des-hep. and CR-hep all were capable of inducing leukocytosis (Fig. 2, B–D), but they were devoid of anticoagulant activities, indicating that the anticoagulant activity of heparin is not required for HIL.

https://openalex.org/W2104537874,"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) hold great promise as models for understanding disease and as a source of cells for transplantation therapies. However, the lack of simple, robust and efficient culture methods remains a significant obstacle for realizing the utility of hPSCs. Here we describe a platform for the culture of hPSCs that 1) allows for dissociation and replating of single cells, 2) significantly increases viability and replating efficiency, 3) improves freeze/thaw viability 4) improves cloning efficiency and 5) colony size variation. When combined with standard methodologies for genetic manipulation, we found that the enhanced culture platform allowed for lentiviral transduction rates of up to 95% and electroporation efficiencies of up to 25%, with a significant increase in the total number of antibiotic-selected colonies for screening for homologous recombination. We further demonstrated the utility of the enhanced culture platform by successfully targeting the ISL1 locus. We conclude that many of the difficulties associated with culturing and genetic manipulation of hPSCs can be addressed with optimized culture conditions, and we suggest that the use of the enhanced culture platform could greatly improve the ease of handling and general utility of hPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2072662046,"A humanized monoclonal antibody raised against human ovarian cancer RMG-I cells and designated as HMOCC-1 (Suzuki, N., Aoki, D., Tamada, Y., Susumu, N., Orikawa, K., Tsukazaki, K., Sakayori, M., Suzuki, A., Fukuchi, T., Mukai, M., Kojima-Aikawa, K., Ishida, I., and Nozawa, S. (2004) Gynecol. Oncol. 95, 290-298) was characterized for its carbohydrate epitope structure. Specifically, a series of co-transfections was performed using mammalian expression vectors encoding specific glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases. These experiments identified one sulfotransferase, GAL3ST3, and one glycosyltransferase, B3GNT7, as required for HMOCC-1 antigen formation. They also suggested that the sulfotransferase CHST1 regulates the abundance and intensity of HMOCC-1 antigen. When HEK293T cells were co-transfected with GAL3ST3 and B3GNT7 expression vectors, transfected cells weakly expressed HMOCC-1 antigen. When cells were first co-transfected with GAL3ST3 and B3GNT7 and then with CHST1, the resulting cells strongly expressed HMOCC-1 antigen. However, when cells were transfected with a mixture of GAL3ST3 and CHST1 before or after transfection with B3GNT7, the number of antigen-positive cells decreased relative to the number seen with only GAL3ST3 and B3GNT7, suggesting that CHST1 plays a regulatory role in HMOCC-1 antigen formation. Because these results predicted that HMOCC-1 antigens are SO(3) → 3Galβ1 → 4GlcNAcβ1 → 3(±SO(3) → 6)Galβ1 → 4GlcNAc, we chemically synthesized mono- and disulfated and unsulfated oligosaccharides. Immunoassays using these oligosaccharides as inhibitors showed the strongest activity by disulfated tetrasaccharide, weak but positive activity by monosulfated tetrasaccharide at the terminal galactose, and no activity by nonsulfated tetrasaccharides. These results establish the HMOCC-1 epitope, which should serve as a useful reagent to further characterize ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1991120853,"Much research has focused on how the amygdala processes individual affects, yet little is known about how multiple types of positive and negative affects are encoded relative to one another at the single-cell level. In particular, it is unclear whether different negative affects, such as fear and disgust, are encoded more similarly than negative and positive affects, such as fear and pleasure. Here we test the hypothesis that the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA), a region known to be important for learned fear and other affects, encodes affective valence by comparing neuronal activity in the BLA during a conditioned fear stimulus (fear CS) with activity during intraoral delivery of an aversive fluid that induces a disgust response and a rewarding fluid that induces a hedonic response. Consistent with the hypothesis, neuronal activity during the fear CS and aversive fluid infusion, but not during the fear CS and rewarding fluid infusion, was more similar than expected by chance. We also found that the greater similarity in activity during the fear- and disgust-eliciting stimuli was specific to a subpopulation of cells and a limited window of time. Our results suggest that a subpopulation of BLA neurons encodes affective valence during learned fear, and furthermore, within this subpopulation, different negative affects are encoded more similarly than negative and positive affects in a time-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2067003511,"The random amino acid copolymer poly(Y,E,A,K)n (Copaxone®) is widely used in multiple sclerosis treatment and a second generation copolymer poly(Y,F,A,K)n with enhanced efficacy in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice has been described. A major mechanism through which copolymers function to ameliorate disease is the generation of immunosuppressive IL-10-secreting regulatory T cells entering the CNS. In addition, the antigen presenting cell to which these copolymers bind through MHC Class II proteins may have an important role. Here, both CCL22 (a Th2 cell chemoattractant) in large amounts and CXCL13 in much smaller amounts are shown to be secreted after administration of YFAK to mice and to a smaller extent by YEAK parallel to their serum concentrations. Moreover, bone marrow-derived macrophages secrete CCL22 in vitro in response to YFAK and to higher concentrations of YEAK. Strikingly, these chemokines are also secreted into serum of MHC Class II −/− mice, indicating that an innate immune receptor on these cells also has an important role. Thus, both the innate and the adaptive immune systems are involved in the mechanism of EAE amelioration by YFAK. The enhanced ability of YFAK to stimulate the innate immune system may account for its enhanced efficacy in EAE treatment."

A key element of the PfM2DH channel is the “mobile” Glu292, which was seen crystallographically to adopt distinct positions up and down the channel. It was suggested that the “down → up” conformational change of Glu292 could play a proton relay function in enzymatic catalysis, through direct proton shuttling by the Glu or because the channel is opened for water molecules forming a chain along which the protons flow. We report evidence from site-directed mutagenesis (Glu292 → Ala) substantiated by data from molecular dynamics simulations that support a role for Glu292 as a gate in a water chain (von Grotthuss-type) mechanism of proton translocation. Occupancy of the up and down position of Glu292 is influenced by the bonding and charge state of the catalytic acid base Lys295, suggesting that channel opening/closing motions of the Glu are synchronized to the reaction progress. Removal of gatekeeper control in the E292A mutant resulted in a selective, up to 120-fold slowing down of microscopic steps immediately preceding catalytic oxidation of mannitol, consistent with the notion that formation of the productive enzyme-NAD+-mannitol complex is promoted by a corresponding position change of Glu292, which at physiological pH is associated with obligatory deprotonation of Lys295 to solvent.

It contains a “mobile” carboxylic acid residue (Glu292) accommodated within an otherwise comparatively hydrophobic channel interior. The side chain of Glu292 was seen to adopt distinct conformations down (Fig. 1A) and up (Fig. 1B) the channel in the holoenzyme bound with NAD+ and a ternary complex of PfM2DH with NAD+ and mannitol, respectively. The down → up movement of Glu292 represents the largest (≈5 Å displacement) among a series of small structural rearrangements in and outside of the PfM2DH channel that occur in response to mannitol binding, as shown in Fig. 1 and supplemental Movie S1. Globally, the conformational change of PfM2DH can be characterized as a subtle domain-opening process in which the C-terminal substrate-binding domain rotates away by about ∼2° from the N-terminal NAD+-binding domain, using the loop region of residues 282–287 as the hinge region. At the top of the channel on the PfM2DH surface, two ionizable amino acids (His294, Glu293) are positioned opposite to each other within hydrogen bonding distance (Fig. 1A). The interaction between His294 and Glu293 becomes disrupted as a result of the down → up movement of Glu292 (Fig. 1B). We extrapolate from reported relationships between structure and function of proton channels (36.Wraight C.A. Chance and design, proton transfer in water, channels, and bioenergetic proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 886-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) that the particular arrangement of His294 and Glu293 might serve the role of a local proton reservoir, facilitating uptake and release of protons in each direction through adjustment of trans-channel proton gradient.

Of note, assistance from Glu292 to the removal of protons from the active site could provide internal “pull” to oxidation of the bound alcohol substrate. In an alternative scenario, Glu292 acts as a gate that opens as a result of the up-flip of the Glu side chain, thereby establishing a “water wire” along which protons can flow to solvent (Fig. 1C, II). In both mechanisms, proton translocation would be effectively discontinuous, and the essential time switch for the conformational change of Glu292 might be provided by events of the catalytic cycle. In marked contrast to PfM2DH, proton relays of other ADHs are typically built from hydrogen bond networks that seem to operate continuously and do not involve major conformational rearrangements to achieve the proton translocation (11.Klimacek M.

In this work, site-directed mutagenesis, kinetics, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation were used to interrogate the proposed dynamic function of Glu292 during proton transfer by PfM2DH. Replacement of the Glu by Ala was chosen to disrupt shuttling motions (Fig. 1C, I) or to prevent closing of the proton channel (Fig. 1C, II). The requirement to decrease steric bulk at position 292 in the channel explains the use of a small residue as compared with the approximately isosteric Gln. Catalysis to mannitol oxidation could thus be compared for situations in which protein control over proton translocation to solvent was present (wild-type enzyme) or absent (E292A). A dynamic mechanism of proton transfer is suggested in which, once mannitol has bound to the enzyme-NAD+ complex, a down → up conformational change of Glu292 results in positioning of Lys295 such that it connects the reactive C2 hydroxyl of substrate to a chain of water molecules in the now open proton conduit (Fig. 1C, II). The opposite up → down motion of Glu292 in the step post-catalysis results in release of Lys295 from being bonded with the carbonyl group of fructose, thereby promoting the product dissociation.

Wild-type PfM2DH was prepared by known procedures (43.Slatner M. Nidetzky B. Kulbe K.D.

The mismatched bases are underlined. The mutated gene was expressed in Escherichia coli JM109, and the E292A mutant was isolated according to protocol (43.Slatner M. Nidetzky B. Kulbe K.D.

CD spectra of wild-type PfM2DH and E292A were recorded as described elsewhere (38.Klimacek M. Nidetzky B. A catalytic consensus motif for d-mannitol 2-dehydrogenase, a member of a polyol-specific long-chain dehydrogenase family, revealed by kinetic characterization of site-directed mutants of the enzyme from Pseudomonas fluorescens.Biochem.

Molar enzyme concentrations were determined from absorbance (280 nm) using an extinction coefficient of 55.4 mm−1 cm−1 for wild-type enzyme and mutant (44.Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A.

Initial reaction rates were recorded spectrophotometrically at 25 °C, measuring the change in absorbance of NADH at 340 nm (ϵ340 = 6.22 mm−1 cm−1). A full steady-state kinetic analysis was performed at pH 7.1 (100 mm Tris-HCl) and pH 10.0 (100 mm glycine-NaOH). Kinetic data were collected with the concentrations of substrate and coenzyme being varied against one another, and parameters (kcat, KiC, KC, KS) were obtained by nonlinear regression, as described elsewhere (38.Klimacek M.

We use subscript O and R on kcat and the transient rate constant kobs (see later) to indicate the direction of mannitol oxidation (kcatO, kobsO) and fructose reduction (kcatR, kobsR), respectively. The pH dependences of kinetic parameters for E292A were determined in the pH range 7.1–10.5 for mannitol oxidation (kcatO, KC, and KS) and 7.1–10.0 for fructose reduction (kcatR, KS) as described previously in studies of other PfM2DH mutants (41.Klimacek M.

Buffers of constant ionic strength for studying pH-dependent processes.Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Kinetic isotope effects (KIE) resulting from deuteration of one of the reactants (2-[2H]mannitol; S-4-[2H]NADH) or solvent were determined using reported procedures (42.Klimacek M. Nidetzky B.

https://openalex.org/W2077537421,"Background Since circulating levels of TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) may be important in the physiopathology of pregnancy, we tested the hypothesis that TRAIL levels change at delivery in response to stressful conditions. Methods/Principal Findings We conducted a longitudinal study in a cohort of 73 women examined at week 12, week 16, delivery and in the corresponding cord blood (CB). Serum TRAIL was assessed in relationship with maternal characteristics and to biochemical parameters. TRAIL did not vary between 12 (67.6±27.6 pg/ml, means±SD) and 16 (64.0±16.2 pg/ml) weeks' gestation, while displaying a significant decline after partum (49.3±26.4 pg/ml). Using a cut-off decline >20 pg/ml between week 12 and delivery, the subset of women with the higher decline of circulating TRAIL (41.7%) showed the following characteristics: i) nullipara, ii) higher age, iii) operational vaginal delivery or urgent CS, iv) did not receive analgesia during labor, v) induced labor. CB TRAIL was significantly higher (131.6±52 pg/ml) with respect to the corresponding maternal TRAIL, and the variables significantly associated with the first quartile of CB TRAIL (<90 pg/ml) were higher pre-pregnancy BMI, induction of labor and fetal distress. With respect to the biochemical parameters, maternal TRAIL at delivery showed an inverse correlation with C-reactive protein (CRP), total cortisol, glycemia and insulin at bivariate analysis, but only with CRP at multivariate analysis. Conclusions Stressful partum conditions and elevated CRP levels are associated with a decrease of circulating TRAIL."
