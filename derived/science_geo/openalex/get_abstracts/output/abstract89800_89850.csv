https://openalex.org/W1487088904,"A rapid method for isolating highly purified rat liver plasma membrane vesicles using isotonic medium and Percoll self-forming gradient centrifugation is described. The vesicles were characterized by enzyme markers and electron microscopy. The method also yielded a fraction rich in nuclei. The vesicles transported Ca2+ in an ATP-dependent manner and this was enhanced by oxalate. The Vmax for Ca2+ uptake was 0.65 +/- 0.08 nmol/mg X min, which was approximately 18-fold higher than for other liver plasma membrane preparations, and the Km for Ca2+ was 5.2 +/- 0.4 nM. Calcium uptake was inhibited by 40-50% in vesicles isolated from rat livers perfused for 3 min with 10(-7)M vasopressin. The half-maximally effective concentration of vasopressin was 5 X 10(-10)M which correlates with that for raising cytosolic Ca2+ and phosphorylase a. Inhibition was not significant in vesicles from livers perfused with vasopressin for only 1 min, indicating that inhibition of the Ca2+ pump may not be involved in the rise in cytosolic Ca2+ observed at 1-2 s with this hormone. Epinephrine (10(-5)M) and angiotensin II (10(-7)M) inhibited Ca2+ uptake by 31 +/- 10 and 26 +/- 5%, respectively, at 3 min. Glucagon (10(-7)M) had no effect. It is proposed that the inhibitory action of the Ca2+-dependent hormones on the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump plays an important role in the actions of these hormones by prolonging the elevation in cytosolic Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1576143677,"Compound 58-035 (3-[decyldimethylsilyl]-N-[2-(4-methylphenyl)-1-phenylethyl]pro panamide) has been found to inhibit the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in both rat hepatoma (Fu5AH) cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in culture. To explore the specificity of 58-035, we have studied the esterification of cholesterol, retinol, and glycerides by the Fu5AH cell and by isolated membranes. Exposure of Fu5AH to cholesterol/phospholipid dispersions and 58-035 (greater than 100 ng/ml) for 24 h resulted in greater than 95% inhibition of cholesterol esterification while cellular free cholesterol increased slightly. Inhibition was also rapid; incorporation of [3H]oleate into cholesteryl [3H]oleate equaled only 12% of control value after 30 min with 58-035 at 5 micrograms/ml. In contrast, there was no decrease in [3H]oleate incorporation into phospholipids or diglycerides, nor was the esterification of [3H]retinol inhibited by 58-035. In microsomal fractions, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase could be inhibited completely by 58-035, while activities of acyl-CoA: retinol acyltransferase and triglyceride synthesis proceeded at 75-100% of control values. These observations that 58-035 is highly selective allow the inference that acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase is a separate microsomal enzyme whose activity can be modulated independently from acyl-CoA:retinol acyltransferase and other cellular acyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W1503403102,"We have employed Chinese hamster ovary cells synchronized by mitotic selection to study the replication and amplification of the dihydrofolate reductase gene. Using bromodeoxyuridine to differentially label newly replicated DNA, we show that the dihydrofolate reductase gene is replicated during the first 2 h of S phase, a time when, at most, 10% of the total genome has been replicated. We find that a 6-h inhibition of DNA synthesis by hydroxyurea beginning 2 h after the initiation of S phase markedly increases the frequency with which cells become resistant to a 100-fold increment in methotrexate. When DNA synthesis resumes following removal of the hydroxyurea, virtually all of the DNA replicated prior to inhibition, including the dihydrofolate reductase gene, is rereplicated. Analysis of the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme content of cells 24 h after treatment with hydroxyurea using the fluorescence-activated cell sorter reveals a subset of cells with elevated dihydrofolate reductase. It is this subset that contains additional copies of the dihydrofolate reductase gene and from which emerge highly methotrexate-resistant cells. We propose that the initial event of amplification is the rereplication of a variable, but relatively large, amount of the genome. As cells are subsequently placed under selection, a number of processes, including recombination events and loss of nonselected DNA sequences occur, resulting in what appears as differential gene amplification."
https://openalex.org/W1487826023,"A very highly purified fraction of KB cell DNA polymerase-alpha, prepared with a monoclonal antibody, contains DNA primase activity. The primase synthesizes oligonucleotide chains initiated with ATP in a reaction that is resistant to alpha-amanitin and strictly dependent on added template and ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs). In the presence of added dNTPs and M13 DNA template, the primase produces a uniform population of oligoribonucleotides, predominantly hexamers to decamers, that are extended by polymerase-alpha into DNA chains up to 3000 nucleotides long. There is no evidence for nucleotide preferences at RNA/DNA junctions. In the absence of added dNTPs, the oligomeric products are heterogeneous in size and composition and susceptible to cleavage by pancreatic DNase I due to their content of short oligodeoxynucleotide tracts synthesized by primase from trace contaminant dNTPs in the rNTP substrates. The primase and polymerase-alpha activities are distinguishable by several physical and chemical criteria, and the primase reaction is only partially sensitive to two potent, independent monoclonal antibodies that neutralize polymerase-alpha. Although the presence of both primase and polymerase-alpha activities in a highly purified immune complex prepared with a monoclonal antibody argues for their tight physical association, the chemical, physical, and immunological discriminations indicate the two catalytic entities are functionally and structurally distinct."
https://openalex.org/W1498775324,"Relationships between mevalonate and DNA synthesis were explored in quiescent human fibroblasts stimulated with human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Studies of others have indicated that mevalonate, or a product of mevalonate other than cholesterol, is essential for DNA replication. The present studies were designed to determine whether there was a critical time in the cell cycle when mevalonate was necessary for later DNA synthesis to occur. Compactin and mevinolin, inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase, were employed to block both the synthesis of mevalonate and of DNA. Compactin inhibited the sharp peak of DNA synthesis which occurs in cells 24 h after PDGF addition in a concentration-dependent manner. This suppression of DNA synthesis was not prevented by low density lipoprotein but was fully reversed by mevalonate. Compactin inhibited DNA synthesis when the inhibitor was present during the time interval 10-20 h after PDGF addition. Its presence only in the interval before 10 h or after 20 h had no effect. Conversely, mevalonate could fully overcome the compactin block in DNA synthesis when present during the period of from 10-20 h after PDGF addition. Mevalonate present only before 10 h or after 20 h had no effect. When mevalonate was added to mevinolin-blocked cells for the interval 10-15 h after PDGF, the mevinolin block of DNA synthesis was 68% overcome; in contrast, only 20% of the reversal of the mevinolin block was seen when mevalonate was added from 15-20 h. Addition of mevalonate for only the 2-h interval of from 10-12 h after PDGF overcame the mevinolin block of DNA synthesis (assayed at 24 h) by 50%. The results show that there is a critical time period, several h before S phase, when PDGF-stimulated cells require mevalonate in order for DNA synthesis to proceed at 24 h. This critical period comprised the interval of approximately 10-20 h after PDGF addition and especially the early part of this interval."
https://openalex.org/W1486748187,"Abstract Prothrombinase is a Ca2+-dependent, 1:1, enzymatic complex of Factor Xa and Factor Va that assembles on the surface of negatively charged phospholipid vesicles or platelets. It catalyzes the proteolytic conversion of prothrombin to the blood-clotting enzyme thrombin. Experimentally determined kinetic parameters, plus Kd and n values for the interaction of substrate, cofactor (Factor Va), and serine protease (Factor Xa) for both phospholipid and each other, were used to develop a model that simulates the functional properties of the enzymatic complex. Through the use of a desk-top computer and a program designated Clotspeed, the distribution of enzymatic components and substrate between the bulk fluid and phospholipid is determined for a given set of initial concentrations of reaction components. Simulated reaction rates are then calculated from the calculated distributions, fractional binding, and local and bulk concentration of reactants. Predicted behavior includes formal Michaelis-Mentenlike properties for the reaction, increasing apparent Km with increased levels of phospholipid, and apparent inhibition by excess substrate, enzyme, and phospholipid. Inhibition by excess enzyme and phospholipid was demonstrated experimentally in quantitative agreement with predicted results. The model is useful in that it rationalizes well the seemingly unusual properties of prothrombinase in straightforward physical terms, provides a means of rationally choosing experimental conditions to both further test and refine the model, and explores the properties not only of prothrombinase but also other blood-clotting or surface-bound enzymatic complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1541566881,"ADP-ribosylation in vivo of histone H1 was studied in hepatoma cells (Yoshida AH 7974) after treatment with the alkylating agent dimethyl sulfate for 30 min and compared with that of other polypeptides. In unstimulated cells, histone H1 was only a minor acceptor (less than 4%) of total monomeric and polymeric ADP-ribosyl residues. Induction of DNA repair by dimethyl sulfate treatment increased total mono(ADP-ribosyl) protein conjugates 1.6-fold whereas histone H1-linked mono(ADP-ribosyl) groups were elevated greater than 30-fold, thus accounting for nearly one-fourth of the net increase in monomeric ADP-ribosyl residues. In contrast, histone H1-associated poly(ADP-ribosyl) residues comprised only 2% of the total increase in poly(ADP-ribose). The extent to which the histone H1 population became ADP-ribosylated was low even in dimethyl sulfate-treated cells. Less than 2% of the histone H1 molecules were mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated and only 0.003% carried poly(ADP-ribosyl) chains when an average chain length of 10 is assumed. The principal polypeptide acceptors of alkylation-induced ADP-ribosylation were concentrated in two peaks, one migrating close to the position of core histones H3/H2B and accepting most of the induced mono(ADP-ribosyl) and poly(ADP-ribosyl) residues. The other (Mr = 110,000-160,000) resembled auto-modified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Our data demonstrate marked differences of alkylation-induced (ADP-ribosyl)n protein patterns to analyses performed in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1575500559,"Following tissue injury, the concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) is known to increase in plasma rapidly, while that of fibronectin often decreases. We now report that CRP immobilized onto polystyrene surfaces binds soluble plasma fibronectin (Kd = 1.5 X 10(-8) M). The binding of fibronectin by CRP was relatively sensitive to ionic conditions, being maximal at physiological NaCl concentrations. A decrease of pH from neutral to 5-6 greatly enhanced the binding of fibronectin by CRP. Ca2+ ions at greater than 1 mM inhibited binding. No binding was observed between fibronectin and CRP in soluble phase. CRP was found also to bind fibrinogen, which competed with fibronectin for CRP-binding sites. This was shown to explain why fibronectin was effectively bound from serum but not from plasma by immobilized CRP. The amount of CRP immobilized was critical in binding fibronectin; a too dense molecular layer of CRP inhibited the binding, as did the postsaturation of free surfaces with albumin, which itself was not bound by CRP. Soluble fibronectin agglutinated CRP-coated latex particles. Most or all of the CRP-binding activity in the fibronectin molecule was localized to the 120-140-kilodalton fragment, which also contains cell-binding and heparin-binding domains of fibronectin. The results provide a link between acute phase response and tissue repair."
https://openalex.org/W1662942466,"ADP-ribosyl protein lyase, formerly termed ADP-ribosyl histone-splitting enzyme (Okayama, H., Honda, M., and Hayaishi, O. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 75, 2254-2257), was purified approximately 4,000-fold from rat liver and characterized. The purified enzyme exhibited a single protein band at the position of Mr = 83,000 upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme split the bond between ADP-ribose and histone H2B or H1, and also acted on ADP-ribosyl pentapeptide (Pro-(ADP-ribosyl)Glu-Pro-Ala-Lys) of H2B but not its deadenylylated derivative, phosphoribosyl pentapeptide. The enzyme cleaved the bond between histone and mono(ADP-ribose), but hardly cleaved the bond with oligo- or poly(ADP-ribose). The enzymatic product was close to, but not identical with, ADP-ribose. The terminal ribose residue, obtained by hydrolysis of the split product by snake venom phosphodiesterase and alkaline phosphatase, was identified as 3-deoxy-D-glycero-pentos-2-ulose by the following gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analyses: 1) the reduced sugar was a mixture of 3-deoxy-threo- and 3-deoxy-erythro-pentitol, and 2) the deuterated reduced sugar was identical with that derived from synthetic 3-deoxy-D-glycero-pentos-2-ulose. This result indicated that the direct product was 5'-ADP-3-deoxypent-2-enofuranose, a dehydrated form of ADP-ribose, and that the enzyme is a lyase and not a hydrolase."
https://openalex.org/W1547893088,"The ability of rabbit alveolar macrophages to specifically recognize and adhere to surfaces derivatized with carbohydrates was examined. Otherwise inert polyacrylamide gels were derivatized with aminohexylglycosides as previously described (Guarnaccia, S. P., and Schnaar, R. L. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14288-14292). Intact viable rabbit alveolar macrophages, isolated by lung lavage, were placed in contact with surfaces derivatized with different glycosides. Only those surfaces derivatized with alpha-D-mannose residues were capable of supporting rabbit alveolar macrophage adhesion. Adhesion was rapid, obtaining maximal levels within 10 min, and occurred readily at either 0 or 37 degrees C. The carbohydrate specificity of the cell adhesion was investigated by the use of soluble carbohydrate inhibitors. The potency of various saccharides to block the adhesion correlated with that demonstrated for blocking the uptake or binding of radiolabeled soluble glycoproteins (Shepherd, V. L., Lee, Y. C., Schlesinger, P. H., and Stahl, P. D. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 1019-1022). Thus, the order of potency observed was: D-Man congruent to L-Fuc greater than D-GlcNAc congruent to D-Glc much greater than D-Gal congruent to D-GalNAc congruent to L-rhamnose. While soluble monosaccharides were capable of blocking adhesion when added in millimolar concentrations, polymannosylated neoglycoproteins were able to block adhesion in the nanomolar concentration range. Adhesion to the mannose-derivatized surfaces was a dynamic event even at 0 degrees C, since adhesion was less susceptible to monosaccharide inhibition at later incubation times. Surfaces derivatized with aminohexyl S-mannoside ligands were more effective in supporting adhesion than those derivatized with the corresponding O-mannosides. Soluble inhibitor studies suggest that this was due to a more favorable conformation of the S-glycoside for binding to the cell surface receptor. The results reported here demonstrate that the previously reported alveolar macrophage mannose/fucose receptor can mediate carbohydrate-specific cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1563110019,"A soluble enzyme preparation from immature sage (Salvia officinalis) leaves has been shown to catalyze the cation-dependent cyclization of geranyl pyrophosphate to the isomeric monoterpene olefins (+/-)-alpha-pinene and (-)-beta-pinene and to lesser amounts of camphene and limonene (Gambliel, H., and Croteau, R. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2335-2342). This preparation was fractionated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-150 to afford two regions of enzymic activity termed geranyl pyrophosphate:pinene cyclase I (Mr approximately equal to 96,000), which catalyzed the conversion of geranyl pyrophosphate to the bicyclic olefin (+)-alpha-pinene, and to smaller quantities of the rearranged olefin (+)-camphene and the monocyclic olefin (+)-limonene, and geranyl pyrophosphate:pinene cyclase II (Mr approximately equal to 55,000), which transformed the acyclic precursor to (-)-alpha-pinene and (-)-beta-pinene, as well as to (-)-camphene, (-)-limonene, and the acyclic olefin myrcene. The multiple olefin biosynthetic activities co-purified with pinene cyclase I on four subsequent chromatographic and electrophoretic steps, and the ability to cyclize geranyl pyrophosphate and the related allylic pyrophosphates neryl pyrophosphate and linalyl pyrophosphate was likewise coincident throughout purification. Fractionation of pinene cyclase II by an identical sequence showed that the activities for the synthesis of the stereochemically related (-)-olefins co-purified, as did the ability to utilize the three acyclic precursors. The general properties of cyclase I and cyclase II were determined, and a scheme for the biosynthesis of the pinenes and related monoterpene olefins was proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1574867324,"We have studied the kinetics, on time scales of minutes and seconds, of formation and interconversion of glucocorticoid-receptor complexes in rat thymus cells under physiological conditions. Nonactivated and activated complexes were measured by a minicolumn technique that permits rapid, multiple simultaneous assays. The rate-limiting step in formation of nuclear complexes was activation, which at 37 degrees C had a half-time of 30-60 s. Activation in cells at 25 degrees C followed first order kinetics. Nuclear binding at 37 degrees C was too fast to measure, and probably has a half-time below 10 s. Earlier findings suggesting that triamcinolone acetonide and dexamethasone give higher steady state ratios of activated to nonactivated complexes than cortisol and corticosterone have been supported by showing that these ratios are concentration-independent, and are unlikely to be due to degradation or dissociation of complexes after cell disruption. A simple cyclic model of receptor kinetics, in which each glucocorticoid is characterized by its dissociation rate constant, accounts quantitatively for these results and many others. The model is based on the assumptions that activation is irreversible, and that energy is required for regenerating functional receptors after each cycle. It yields steady state ratios of activated to nonactivated complexes in agreement with experiment without introducing steroid-specific allosteric influences on activation, and suggests a new mechanism for explaining agonist-antagonist relationships."
https://openalex.org/W1893052060,"In efforts to develop potent 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors without affinity for the androgen receptor, synthetic 3-oxo-5 alpha-steroids were tested for their ability to inhibit 5 alpha-reductase, using [14C]testosterone as the substrate, and for their ability to inhibit the binding of [3H]5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone to the androgen receptor of rat prostate cytosol. 2',3' alpha-Tetrahydrofuran-2'-spiro-17-(5 alpha-androstan-3-one) is not an inhibitor of 5 alpha-reductase and has a high affinity for the androgen receptor; substitution of the -CH2- at the 4-position with N-H resulted in a good inhibitor of 5 alpha-reductase. The 4-N-CH3 derivative is even more active, whereas the N-CH2-CH3 derivative is inactive. These 4-aza derivatives have much lower affinity for the androgen receptor than the parent compound. The 4-N-H derivatives of several 3-oxo-5 alpha-steroids were found to be 20-100% as potent as their corresponding 4-N-CH3 analogs as inhibitors of 5 alpha-reductase, whereas their androgen receptor affinities were at least 40-fold lower than their 4-N-CH3 analogs. Their 5 beta-isomers did not inhibit either 5 alpha-reductase or the androgen receptor binding of [3H]5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone. Two of these 4-N-H steroids, 17 beta-N,N-diethylcarbamoyl-4-aza-5 alpha-androstan-3-one and 17 beta-N, N-diisopropylcarbamoyl-4-aza-5 alpha-androstan-3-one, are potent 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors with Ki values equal to 29.2 +/- 1.7 and 12.6 +/- 0.8 nM, respectively, but have little affinity for the androgen receptor. The inhibition of 5 alpha-reductase by both compounds is competitive with testosterone. When [3H]testosterone was incubated with minced rat prostate in the presence of either of these two 4-azasteroids, the nuclear concentration of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone decreased and that of testosterone increased. The total nuclear uptake of testosterone plus 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone was not significantly affected. These 4-azasteroids should be useful for investigating the importance of 5 alpha-reductase in androgen action in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1557618885,"Rat liver microsomes devoid of free thiols were prepared in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer in the presence of 30 microM leupeptin. The activation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase by GSH and dithiothreitol (DTT) in these microsomes was studied and compared to the activation by these thiols of enzyme that was solubilized by freeze-thawing. An increase of Vmax was observed, for the two enzyme preparations, with increasing concentrations of the two activating thiols. Reactions of GSH-activated microsomal enzyme with increasing concentrations of NADPH show sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of 2.01 +/- 0.07 at 2-4 mM GSH. Increase of the activating GSH concentrations resulted in a gradual change towards Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and a Hill coefficient of 1.08 +/- 0.03 for NADPH was calculated at 25 mM GSH. Activation of the microsomal enzyme by DTT yielded similar results except that a Hill coefficient of 1.1 was observed already at 2.5 mM DTT. Normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed for HMG-CoA at all GSH concentrations. Solubilization of HMG-CoA reductase by the widely used freeze-thaw procedure abolished the cooperative pattern, and normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Hill coefficient of 1.0 was observed regardless of GSH concentration. These results are compatible with a model in which HMG-CoA reductase activity is GSH-dependent, allosterically modulated under physiological hepatic conditions. In addition, the widely used assay conditions, using high DTT concentrations or employment of highly purified soluble enzyme precluded the observation of sigmoidal kinetics and the suggested model."

N., and Sibley, C. C. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 824-826). The labeled protein was reduced and carboxymethylated and then cleaved with cyanogen bromide. The peptide containing the hydroxynitrobenzyl-labeled tryptophan was isolated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. Amino acid analysis of the labeled peptide indicates that it corresponds to residues 21 through 89 of human antithrombin III. The site of labeling corresponds to Trp 49, which is located within the disulfide-stabilized loops near the NH2-terminal end of the antithrombin III molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1517766790,"1-O-Alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl 3-phosphorylcholine or acetylglyceryl ether phosphorylcholine (AGEPC) stimulated glycogenolysis in perfused livers from fed rats at concentrations as low as 10(-11) M. At the lower AGEPC concentrations, e.g. 2 X 10(-10) M, a single transient phase of enhanced hepatic glucose output was elicited upon infusion of this agonist. At higher concentrations, e.g. 2 X 10(-8) M, a sharp transient spike of glucose output was observed, followed by a stable elevated steady state rate of glucose output until the AGEPC infusion was terminated. Increased rates of lactate and acetoacetate output and a diminished hepatic oxygen consumption were characteristic of the response of the livers to AGEPC at 2 X 10(-10) M. Neither alpha- nor beta-adrenergic antagonists blocked the glycogenolytic response of AGEPC. Repeated infusion of AGEPC led to homologous desensitization of the response, but the response of the liver to the alpha-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine, or to glucagon, subsequent to AGEPC stimulation, was unaffected. Increasing the period of perfusion between successive additions of AGEPC, from 7 to 30 min, resulted in an increased glycogenolytic response to this agonist. When the perfusate calcium concentration was reduced from 1.25 to 0.05 mM, the glycogenolytic response to AGEPC was markedly diminished; calcium efflux from the liver following stimulation with AGEPC was not observed. The data presented in this study illustrate a potent agonist effect of AGEPC on the glycogenolytic system in the rat liver."
https://openalex.org/W1488988363,"Retroendocytosis of low density lipoprotein (LDL) is a newly identified pathway of cellular LDL processing in which LDL that has been internalized via LDL receptors is subsequently re-excreted from the cell and not degraded in the lysosomes. In the present study, we examined several characteristics of the retroendocytosis process as well as some of the physical characteristics of the retroendocytosed LDL. Monkey skin fibroblasts were pulse labeled with 125I-LDL for 4 h at 37 degrees C and were then washed extensively to remove both surface and LDL receptor-bound 125I-LDL. Retroendocytosis of LDL was determined by measuring the release of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable 125I-material during a subsequent 2-h chase period. In the presence of the lysosomotropic agents, chloroquine and methylamine, the absolute amount of LDL retroendocytosed was increased up to 3-fold. Without the lysosomotropic agents, less than 10% of the cell-associated 125I-LDL was lost by retroendocytosis in a 2-h chase period; this value increased to as much as 30% in the presence of the lysosomotropic agents. In the presence of lysosomotropic agents, the amount of LDL processed by retroendocytosis was approximately equivalent to the amount of LDL that was degraded. This enhancement of retroendocytosis was seen at 37 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C and was observed only when the lysosomotropic agents were present during the pulse period. Thus, the enhanced retroendocytosis was not a direct effect of the lysosomotropic agents but, instead, was probably secondary to the buildup of undegraded LDL within the cell. As a result, under certain conditions, retroendocytosis of LDL may be a quantitatively important alternate pathway for the cellular processing of LDL. In the absence of lysosomal inhibitors, up to one-third of the retroendocytosed material could have come from 125I-LDL that had not been removed from the cell surface prior to the chase period. In the presence of the lysosomotropic agents, however, less than 10% could have come from the cell surface. The enhancement of retroendocytosis by the lysosomotropic agents was not the result of cytotoxic effects of these agents since release of [3H]leucine-labeled cell proteins was altered only slightly. Thus, the bulk of the retroendocytosed LDL resulted from an active metabolic process for the efflux of LDL that had previously been internalized by the cell.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1507835960,"Routes which contribute to the transport of methotrexate across the plasma membrane of L1210 cells have been evaluated. A single high affinity transport system was found to be the only route for methotrexate uptake. This conclusion was derived from the observations that influx at high substrate concentrations (up to 50 microM) both reaches a single maximum value and can be inhibited by greater than 98% either by treatment of the cells with an active ester of methotrexate or by the direct addition of excess amounts of competitive inhibitors. Efflux, conversely, could be separated into three components. One of these routes was dependent upon extracellular anions and could be blocked by active ester treatment and, therefore, appeared to be the same transport system which mediates methotrexate influx. A second route was identified by its sensitivity to bromosulfophthalein, while a third component was insensitive to both active ester treatment and to bromosulfophthalein. When these efflux routes were quantitated in a buffered saline medium, the methotrexate influx carrier was found to account for the major portion (71%) of total efflux. The inhibitor-insensitive component contributed an additional 23%, while the remaining 6% was attributable to the bromosulfophthalein-sensitive route. The addition of glucose increased total efflux by 3-fold and caused a substantial change in the proportion of efflux that occurred via each of the three components. The major portion of efflux (46%) now occurred via the bromosulfophthalein-sensitive route, while the influx carrier contributed only 29% of the total. The inhibitor-insensitive route accounted for the remaining 25%. The opposite result was obtained with metabolic inhibitors which decreased total efflux but increased the contribution by the influx carrier to greater than 80%. The demonstration of multiple routes for methotrexate efflux and their differential sensitivities to alterations in energy metabolism thus provides a basis for explaining previously described asymmetries between the influx and efflux of methotrexate in mouse leukemia cells."
https://openalex.org/W1486846195,"We have examined the 5'-and 3'-flanking sequence requirements for the wild type transcription properties of a Drosophila tRNA Arg gene through the use of transcription assays in cell-free extracts. Thirty-three base pairs of the 5' flank immediately adjacent to the sequence encoding the mature tRNA are necessary for efficient transcription in Drosophila Kc cell extract. Sequences affecting factor binding to form stable transcription complexes extend more than 60 base pairs into the 5' flank, and approximately 35 base pairs into the 3' flank. HeLa cell extract exhibits dependence, albeit reduced, on the same 5'-flanking sequence; it also has 3'-flanking sequence requirements for maximal stable complex formation. This requirement of in vitro transcription for flanking sequence is not dependent on the use of a homologous system, but is dependent on the cellular source of the extract."
https://openalex.org/W1596846507,"Thrombin causes a dose-dependent depolarization of the transmembrane potential of normal human platelets which can be continuously measured by the fluorescent probe, 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine, whose distribution across the plasma membrane has been shown to be dependent upon the membrane potential. The dose-dependent depolarization of the platelet's negative membrane potential by thrombin is in large part due to a rapid uptake of sodium. Both the membrane potential change and the rapid sodium influx can be inhibited by a fast acting analog of amiloride, a sodium channel blocker, while valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, has no effect on the potential change nor on the sodium uptake, suggesting that the transmembrane potassium gradient is not important in the thrombin-induced depolarization. Neither the secretion of serotonin nor that of lysosomal enzymes nor the secondary release of the fluorescent probe which correlates with the lysosomal enzyme secretion occur if treatment with valinomycin precedes activation by thrombin. It is thus apparent that: 1) the change in the membrane potential induced by thrombin is directly dependent upon the transmembrane sodium gradient and is primarily due to a dose-dependent sodium uptake by the platelets; and 2) the thrombin-induced secretory processes are dependent upon maintenance of the transmembrane potassium gradients."
https://openalex.org/W1521029725,"The views that catabolism of protein leads to net production of acid and that urinary excretion of ammonium ion represents an equimolar excretion of proton are not compatible with basic chemical relationships (Atkinson, D.E., and Camien, M.N. (1982) Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 21, 261-302). Metabolism of protein produces significant amounts of base (bicarbonate), which is disposed of in the synthesis of urea. In perfused rat liver and in isolated rat hepatocytes, the rate of urea synthesis increases with increase in pH but is not affected by change in the concentration of bicarbonate when pH is held constant. An increase in the concentration of ammonium ion in the suspending medium causes an increase in the rate of urea synthesis by hepatocytes when lactate is the energy source, as previously reported by others, but causes a decrease in the rate of urea synthesis during incubation with glucose or with no added energy source. The rate of urea synthesis decreases when glucose is added to lactate medium. All of these observations are consistent with the view that disposal of bicarbonate is a major function of urea synthesis, and that regulation of the rate of ureagenesis is an important factor in the maintenance of pH homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1605799604,"Abstract Band 3 (Mr = 95,000), the anion transport protein of human erythrocyte membranes exists primarily as a dimer in solutions of nonionic detergents such as octaethylene glycol mono-n-dodecyl ether (C12E8). The role of the oligomeric structure of Band 3 in the binding of [14C]4-benzamido-4'-aminostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (BADS), an inhibitor of anion transport (Ki = 1-2 microM), was studied by characterizing the interaction of BADS with dimers and monomers of Band 3 covalently attached to p-mercuribenzoate-Sepharose 4B. BADS bound to matrix-bound Band 3 dimers with an affinity of approximately 3 microM at a stoichiometry of 1 BADS molecule/Band 3 monomer, in agreement with the BADS binding characteristic of Band 3 in the membrane and in solutions of C12E8. Band 3 dimers could be attached to the matrix via one subunit by limiting the amount of p-chloromercuribenzoate on the Sepharose bead. Matrix-bound monomers were formed by dissociation of the dimers with dodecyl sulfate or guanidine hydrochloride. Complete removal of the denaturants allowed formation of refolded Band 3 monomers since the matrix-bound subunits could not reassociate. These refolded Band 3 monomers were unable to bind BADS. Release of the monomers from the matrix with 2-mercaptoethanol allowed reformation of dimers with recovery of the BADS binding sites. These results suggest that the dimeric structure of Band 3 is required for BADS binding and that the BADS binding sites may be at the interface between the two halves of the Band 3 dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1576953181,"The terminal hydroxylation in placental estrogen biosynthesis from androgens is at the 2 beta position. The 2 beta-hydroxy-19-oxoandrogen derivative collapses nonenzymatically to estrogen and is therefore the proximate precursor of the female hormone. To establish the role of this pathway in biological aromatization, an immunological approach was employed in which an antibody was obtained which recognizes 2 beta-hydroxy-19-oxygenated androgens but not intermediates oxygenated at C-19 only. Binding of the 2 beta-hydroxy-19-oxo intermediate by the antibody stabilizes it so that its nonenzymatic transformation to estrogen is delayed and results in slower estrogen formation. When placental microsomes were incubated with [1,2-3H]androstenedione in the presence of the antibody antiserum, a 50% decrease in [3H]estradiol formation and 3H2O release was observed when compared with identical incubations containing normal rabbit serum alone. This inhibition is blocked when the antibody is inactivated by presaturation with 2 beta, 19-dihydroxyandrostenedione. Precipitation of immunoglobulins from the incubations followed by heating liberated the 2 beta-hydroxy-19-oxo intermediate (30%) from the antibody, and resulted in its nonenzymatic collapse to estrogen with concomitant release of 3H2O. Control normal rabbit serum or blocked antibody incubations did not show a similar increase in [3H]estradiol or 3H2O yields in the precipitate. Heat treatment (90 degrees C) of the antibody but not normal rabbit serum incubations resulted in a similar increase in [3H]estradiol and 3H2O yields. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the final and rate-determining hydroxylation in aromatization of androgens is at the 2 beta position and that this pathway is the dominant, if not the sole, route of estrogen biosynthesis by placental aromatase. The antibody probe also permits the characterization of aromatization mechanisms in tissues other than the placenta."
https://openalex.org/W1511310156,"Glucocerebrosidase from normal human spleen, and spleen from cases of neurologic (types 2 and 3) and nonneurologic (type 1) Gaucher's disease, was delipidated and inactivated by extraction from membranes with sodium cholate and ice-cold 1-butanol. Control glucocerebrosidase was stimulated markedly by large quantities (20-30 micrograms/assay) of phosphatidylserine (PS), or by a combination of smaller amounts (1-2 micrograms) of PS and 3 micrograms of a heat-stable factor (HSF) derived from the spleen of a patient with Gaucher's disease. The residual glucocerebrosidase from a nonneurologic case, but not a neurologic case, was also responsive to PS and HSF. The combination of HSF and PS decreased the Km of the normal enzyme for 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside from 8.0 to 1.6 mM. These effectors also increased the reactivity of glucocerebrosidase to the inhibitor conduritol B epoxide; HSF alone had no effect (t1/2 = 19 +/- 0.5 min) whereas the maximum rate of inactivation (t1/2 = 4.0 min) by conduritol B epoxide was achieved in the presence of a mixture of PS (1 microgram) and HSF (3 micrograms). Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidic acid, also acidic phospholipids, were effective activators of glucocerebrosidase. Varying the fatty acid composition of PG had little effect on its ability to stimulate glucocerebrosidase activity. However, in the case of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a weaker activator than PG or PS, fatty acid composition had a significant impact on the ability of this neutral lipid to activate glucocerebrosidase; dilinoleoyl-PC and dicaproyl-PC were moderately effective activators, but distearoyl-PC and dioleoyl-PC were almost totally inactive. The mono-, and di-, and trisialogangliosides (GM1, GD1, and GT1 were less than half as effective as PS as activators of glucocerebrosidase. These results indicate that acidic phospholipids and the heat-stable factor may both play a role in explaining the genetic heterogeneity of Gaucher's disease."

In contrast, the (23S,25R)-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 26,23-lactol was converted to the lactone in kidney homogenates regardless of the vitamin D status of the animals used. A new metabolite was isolated in pure form from the incubation mixture of 23S,25R,26-trihydroxyvitamin D3 with kidney homogenates prepared from vitamin D-supplemented chicks. The metabolite was identified as (23S,25R)-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 26,23-lactol by its ultraviolet and mass spectra and by derivatization. The structure was confirmed by direct comparison with an authentic sample on high pressure liquid chromatography. The evidence suggests that the stereochemistries of the isolated lactol at the 23- and 25-positions are S and R, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1549166571,"Rabbit peritoneal neutrophils were reacted for 5-10 s with the chemotactic factors, fMet-Leu-Phe or (5S),(12R)-dihydroxy-6,8,11,14-(cis,trans,trans,cis)-eicosatetraenoic acid and then lysed with a solution of Triton X-100 and [gamma-32P]ATP. They showed an enhanced incorporation of 32P in Mr = 60,000- and 67,000-dalton polypeptides compared to control cells treated similarly. Another chemotactic factor, C5a, produced a similar but much lesser effect. The enhancement was not affected by the addition of the purified catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, the inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, or CaCl2, suggesting that the effect was not mediated by a cAMP-dependent or a Ca2+-dependent protein kinase. When analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the Mr = 60,000 phosphoprotein contained several phosphoproteins with different isoelectric points. The isoelectric point and molecular weight of one of them was similar to those of the intermediate filament protein, vimentin, purified from Chinese hamster ovary cells. Addition of the purified Chinese hamster ovary vimentin and [gamma-32P]ATP to the Triton X-100 lysate of fMet-Leu-Phe-treated neutrophils resulted as an enhanced incorporation of 32P into the vimentin. Addition of fMet-Leu-Phe to 32P-labeled intact neutrophils also enhanced incorporation of 32P into the vimentin of neutrophils. The results suggest that chemotactic factors stimulate vimentin phosphorylation in rabbit neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1572395605,"Alkaline phosphatase has been implicated in matrix vesicle-mediated calcification. We sought to clarify its role in this process by studying the effect of L-tetramisole, a strong uncompetitive inhibitor of this enzyme, and D-tetramisole, its inactive isomer, on the uptake of 32Pi and 45Ca by matrix vesicle-enriched microsomes obtained from chicken epiphyseal cartilage. Uptake of both 32Pi and 45Ca was inhibited in a dosage-dependent manner by the L-isomer; however, 32Pi uptake was selectively inhibited at low drug concentrations and at early time periods. With increasing incubation time, inhibition of uptake of both ions was lost. Apatite crystal growth was only weakly inhibited by both the D- and L-isomers of tetramisole. The kinetics of ion uptake by the vesicles was complex. 45Ca/32Pi uptake ratios, taken with the selective inhibiton of 32Pi uptake by L-tetramisole, indicated that early phases of vesicle ion uptake might be governed by alkaline phosphatase, a known Pi-binding protein. Later stages were clearly controlled by apatite formation. Although inhibition of vesicle uptake of 32Pi and 45Ca by graded levels of L-tetramisole paralleled inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity, surprisingly, D-tetramisole was almost as inhibitory of ion uptake as the L-isomer. This finding, coupled with the fact that alkaline phosphatase substrates were not required for vesicle ion uptake, indicates that alkaline phosphatase hydrolase activity is not directly involved in vesicle-mediated calcification under these experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1616749105,"Abstract A Mr = 32,000 membrane glycoprotein can be uniquely labeled by galactose oxidase/[3H]sodium borohydride on rat caudal, but not caput, epididymal sperm. It has been suggested that this protein is related to a Mr = 32,000 galactose oxidase-sensitive glycoprotein present in rat caudal epididymal fluid. The tritiated membrane glycoprotein was solubilized and its hydrodynamic properties were determined by conventional gel filtration, high performance gel filtration, sedimentation rate determination in linear sucrose gradients prepared in H2O and D2O, and equilibrium isopycnic centrifugations in CsCl. The Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient were 4.87 +/- 0.07 nm and 1.73 +/- 0.08 S, respectively. The sedimentation profile in CsCl gradients was asymmetric with a major peak occurring at a density of 1.081 g/cm3 (v = 0.92 cm3/g) and a shoulder at 1.108 g/cm3 (v = 0.90 cm3/g). The glycoprotein did not enter a 5 to 20% linear sucrose gradient prepared in D2O and could be extracted from the intact sperm into acidic chloroform:methanol solutions. These data are consistent with a protein which binds substantial amounts of detergent and/or lipid and has exposed hydrophobic regions. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis indicated that the membrane protein exhibits charge heterogeneity, with the major components having pI values of 5.4 and 4.9. The fluid glycoprotein was monodisperse on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis having a pI of 3.8. Binding studies failed to demonstrate specific binding of the Mr = 32,000 caudal fluid glycoprotein to caput cells. Moreover, Western blots of electrophoretically resolved caput and caudal fluid proteins, followed by immunolabeling with antibodies raised against unfractionated caudal fluid, demonstrated the presence of a Mr = 32,000 protein in caudal fluid which was absent from caput epididymal fluid. Using the same technique, it was shown that antibodies raised against caudal fluid proteins did not cross-react with a Mr = 32,000 caudal membrane glycoprotein. Our data do not support the view that the Mr = 32,000 fluid and membrane proteins are identical."
https://openalex.org/W1568047255,Genomic clones which link the goat preadult (beta C) and adult (beta A) beta-globin genes have been isolated. These overlapping clones contain a previously unidentified embryonic like globin gene (epsilon III) and establish the following linkage map of eight genes in the goat beta-globin locus: epsilon I-epsilon II-psi beta X-beta C-epsilon III-epsilon IV-psi beta Z-beta A. This linkage map and the nucleotide sequence of the eight genes document a relatively recent duplication of a four-gene set: epsilon-epsilon-psi beta-beta. This duplication produced two genes (beta C and beta A) which are now expressed differentially during development. An embryonic like globin gene located downstream from beta A has also been isolated. The embryonic nature of this gene as well as the adult beta-like sequence of the goat fetal globin gene (gamma) suggest that a duplication of the four-gene set also produced the globin gene now expressed during fetal development.
https://openalex.org/W1526860994,"The involvement of the COOH-terminal histidines of the beta chains of human hemoglobin in the allosteric mechanism of oxygen binding has been the topic of intensive discussion. Data presented here on the functional properties of native and chemically modified forms of Hb Cowtown (beta 146 His replaced by Leu) suggest that approximately half of the alkaline Bohr effect is attributable to the imidazole of His HC3(146) beta. The contribution of this residue to the alkaline Bohr effect has been estimated variably as 40-60% and 15% or less. Equilibrium and kinetic studies show that the amino acid substitution in Hb Cowtown decreases the stability of the low affinity conformation, resulting in an increased oxygen affinity and altered sensitivity to anionic effectors. Detailed analysis of Hill plots of oxygen binding according to the Adair scheme reveals that, under conditions of moderate ionic strength (chloride = 0.1 M), the K2 and K3 values for Hb A and Hb Cowtown differ, whereas the K1 and K4 values are closely similar over the physiological pH range. The decreased pH sensitivity of Hb Cowtown is associated with a decreased pH sensitivity of K1, the first Adair constant. In contrast to des-His(146 beta) hemoglobin, the cooperative interactions shown by Hb Cowtown under conditions of moderate ionic strength are not reduced in comparison to those of Hb A. This and the similarity of K1 and K4 values for Hb A and Hb Cowtown indicate that under these conditions the salt bridge formed by the COOH-terminal imidazole group does not significantly contribute to the free energy difference between T-state and R-state hemoglobin. It appears that the salt bridge formed by the COOH-terminal carboxyl group stabilizes the deoxy, T-state, conformation to a greater degree than previously appreciated. Chemical modification of the Cys(93 beta) residue of Hb Cowtown with N-ethylmaleimide causes a decrease in its oxygen affinity, in contrast to the increase in affinity exhibited by N-ethylmaleimide-modified Hb A. Hemoglobins A and Cowtown have remarkably similar oxygen binding properties after this modification and are shown to have K1 and K4 values distinctly different from those of unmodified Hb A. The properties of native and chemically modified forms of Hb Cowtown are indicative of a large contribution of the His HC3 (146) beta residue to the alkaline Bohr effect and also illustrate how chemical modifications or changes of strategic amino acid residues can result in pronounced differences in the conformational equilibrium of an allosteric protein."
https://openalex.org/W1518904592,"The differences in conformation in solution of fluorosulfonylbenzoyl nucleosides were analyzed by fluorescence and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The quantum yield of 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl-1,N6-ethenoadenosine (5'-FSB epsilon A) in aqueous solution is low (o = 0.01) as compared to that of its parent nucleoside, ethenoadenosine (o = 0.54), and increases approximately 5-fold when measured in a series of solvents of decreasing dielectric constant. The quantum yield of 5'-p-sulfonylbenzoyl-1,N6-ethenoadenosine covalently bound to glutamate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase is also 0.01, suggesting that the analogue may exist in the same conformation when enzyme-bound as when free in solution. In D2O, the resonances of the purine ring protons on 5'-FSB epsilon A, 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine (5'-FSBA), and 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl guanosine (5'-FSBG) are shifted upfield by about 0.1-0.3 ppm relative to the corresponding protons of their parent nucleosides. The calculated difference in chemical shift (delta delta) decreases as the dielectric constant of the solvent decreases. The delta delta decreases with increasing temperature. These data indicate that 5'-FSB epsilon A, 5'-FSBA, and 5'-FSBG exist in aqueous solution in a conformation in which the purine ring is intramolecularly stacked with the benzoyl moiety. From the magnitude of change in delta delta for 5'-FSB epsilon A, 5'-FSBA, and 5'-FSBG as a function of solvent, it appears that the three analogues differ in their sensitivity to disruption of stacking. The solution conformation of these three fluorosulfonylbenzoyl nucleoside analogues may be an important determinant of their reaction with various enzymes and may explain differences among the analogues in their reaction with a single enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1596169178,"Dimers of bovine pancreatic RNase A give nonhyperbolic saturation curves for the substrate of the second, rate-limiting step of the reaction. Under the same conditions, the monomeric native enzyme shows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Naturally dimeric bovine seminal RNase, which has been found to give nonhyperbolic saturation curves, loses this property upon monomerization. It is proposed that when RNase monomers are arranged in a quaternary structure, they assume a conformation which enables them to be modulated in their catalytic activities. A correlation is suggested between this effect and the quaternary structure proposed for both of these dimeric ribonucleases, in which composite active sites are generated by the mutual exchange of the NH2-terminal ends of the two monomers."
https://openalex.org/W1523762182,"Acylation of extracts of Photobacterium phosphoreum at different stages of growth with [3H]tetradecanoic acid (+ATP) has shown that two polypeptides found in the fatty acid reductase complex, the fatty acid activating enzyme (50K) and the 34K polypeptide, were specifically labeled during induction of the luminescent system. An alternate method for in vitro acylation of polypeptides in the luminescent system was developed using tetradecanoyl-CoA. Both the 34K polypeptide and, to a lesser extent, the acyl-CoA reductase component (58K) in the complex, were acylated with [3H]tetradecanoyl-CoA. In contrast, the fatty acid activating enzyme (50K) was not labeled. Labeling of both the 34K and 58K polypeptides with [3H]tetradecanoyl-CoA as well as the acyl-CoA reductase activity in extracts paralleled the induction of luciferase during growth. Differential labeling of P. phosphoreum cells with [35S]methionine before luminescence induction and with [3H]methionine after the onset of luminescence followed by purification of luciferase and the polypeptides in the fatty acid reductase complex demonstrated that the alpha and beta subunits of luciferase and the 34K, 50K, and 58K polypeptides of the complex had 3H/35S ratios at least 7-fold higher than the constitutive proteins. These results give evidence that the synthesis of the component polypeptides of the fatty acid reductase are induced during the development of bioluminescence and may be under the same control as luciferase. The experiments also showed that P. phosphoreum may have the highest content of luciferase of any luminescent bacterium, constituting approximately 20% of the total soluble protein in extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1540455329,"The rate of ATP hydrolysis in solutions of F-actin at steady state in 50 mM KC1, 0.1 mM CaC12 was inhibited by AMP and ADP. The inhibition was competitive with ATP (Km of about 600 microM) with Ki values of 9 microM for AMP and 44 microM for ADP. ATP hydrolysis was inhibited greater than 95% by 1 mM AMP. AMP had no effect on the time course of actin polymerization, ATP hydrolysis during polymerization, or the critical actin concentration. Simultaneous measurements of G-actin/F-actin subunit exchange and nucleotide exchange showed that nucleotide exchange occurred much more rapidly than subunit exchange; during the experiment over 50% of the F-actin-bound nucleotide was replaced when less than 1% of the F-actin subunits had exchanged. When AMP was present it was incorporated into the polymer, preventing incorporation of ADP from ATP in solution. F-actin with bound Mg2+ was much less sensitive to AMP than F-actin with bound Ca2+. These data provide evidence for an ATP hydrolysis cycle associated with direct exchange of F-actin-bound ADP for ATP free in solution independent of monomer-polymer end interactions. This exchange and hydrolysis of nucleotide may be enhanced when Ca2+ is bound to the F-actin protomers."
https://openalex.org/W1605364110,"The location and amino acid sequence surrounding a cysteine residue required for carbohydrate binding in the lima bean lectin (LBL) was determined. Following selective conversion of the sulfhydryl group to its S-cyano derivative, LBL was cleaved at the essential cysteine residue to give two fragments, estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in two buffer systems to have molecular masses of 16.5-19 kDa and 10.5-11 kDa. The larger fragment, which contained the glycosyl moiety of the lectin, was shown by sequence analysis to contain the NH2-terminal sequence of LBL. The smaller COOH-terminal fragment was found to contain the cysteine residue involved in the intersubunit disulfide bond of LBL. Digestion of LBL with pepsin and trypsin yielded four peptides containing the essential cysteine. Sequencing of the three major peptides gave a single consensus sequence, Val-Glu-Phe-Asp-Thr-Cys-His-Asn-Leu-Asp-, for the primary sequence surrounding the cysteine. The peptide sequence and site of cyanylation cleavage were used to predict alignment of the LBL peptide with the primary sequence of concanavalin A. Maximum homology was found with a sequence in concanavalin A beginning at valine 7. Implications of this alignment to the function of the cysteine in carbohydrate and metal ion binding of LBL, and for conservation of carbohydrate binding site residues in legume lectins are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1561353810,"Abstract Several colchicine-resistant (ColR) mutants of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line, PodRII6, which has earlier been shown to be affected in a microtubule-associated protein (referred to as P1 in these studies), have been isolated. Gel electrophoretic analyses show that one of the ColR mutants (ColR22) contains an additional new protein spot (designated as M2; Mr congruent to 70,000) that is derived by a mutational alteration in a neighboring more acidic protein P2 present in both PodRII6 and ColR22 cell lines. Studies on the relative amounts of the M2 and P2 proteins (and also the M1 and P1) in the ColR22 mutant and hybrid (i.e. ColR22 X PodS) cells are in accordance with the codominant behavior of the mutations and provide evidence that in the ColR22 mutant only one of the two copies of the genes for these proteins has been mutated. The two proteins which are affected in this mutant have been shown to constitute microtubule-associated proteins by a number of criteria. (i) These proteins along with tubulins are specifically released upon Ca2+ treatment of detergent-extracted cytoskeletons containing microtubules, but not if microtubules have been destroyed by prior treatment with colchicine. (ii) Cold treatment of a microtubule-containing fraction also releases the same set of proteins as in criterion i above. (iii) When the mutant cells are treated as in criterion i or ii, then along with the wild type forms, the mutant forms of the above proteins are also found in the microtubule-specific fractions. The cell extracts from PodRII6 and ColR22 mutants show reduced binding of both [3H] podophyllotoxin and [3H]colchicine, indicating that the above proteins are involved in the binding of these drugs to microtubules. It is suggested that the proteins P1 and P2, which are present in Chinese hamster ovary cells in nearly equimolar amounts with (alpha + beta)-tubulins, may comprise important microtubule structural components."
https://openalex.org/W1746360986,"NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase from bovine heart was activated by lower concentrations of citrate in the presence of ADP (apparent S0.5 citrate = 0.033 mM) than in its absence (apparent S0.5 citrate = 2.64 mM) at low magnesium DL-isocitrate (0.18 mM) and free DL-isocitrate3- (0.45 mM) concentrations. Under these conditions, citrate (0.3 mM) lowered the apparent S0.5 for ADP from 0.24 to 0.05 mM. The binding of NAD+ was unaffected by citrate; however, saturating concentrations of citrate lowered the apparent S0.5 for magnesium isocitrate from 0.63 to 0.19 mM in the presence of ADP. Citrate does not appear to bind to the regulatory or catalytic magnesium isocitrate-binding sites, since the Hill coefficient for magnesium isocitrate was not lowered by citrate nor did inhibition occur at high citrate concentrations. The data suggest that magnesium citrate was the activating species. Citrate activation occurred from pH 6.5 to 8.0. As with magnesium citrate, calcium citrate lowered the S0.5 for magnesium isocitrate (apparent S0.5 for calcium citrate = 0.26 mM), and it did not appear to bind to the regulatory or catalytic magnesium isocitrate-binding sites. However, in contrast to the substantial facilitation of magnesium citrate activation by ADP, no activation by calcium citrate occurred in the presence of ADP. Differences in the mechanism of activation of the enzyme by magnesium citrate and calcium citrate were also indicated by the finding that, whereas a number of tricarboxylates could replace citrate as an activator with Mg2+ as the sole divalent cation activator, only citrate was effective for the further enhancement of velocity by added calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1523831044,"In the presence of glycerol, the thionucleotide 2-amino-6-mercapto-9-ribofuranosyl purine 5'-triphosphate (S6-GTP) promotes the assembly of 6 S tubulin to form microtubules. Microtubules assembled with this analog show normal stability properties. In the absence of glycerol, few microtubules are formed with S6-GTP; however, many twisted ribbons are evident. Binding of S6-GTP to tubulin from which the associated proteins and exchangeable nucleotide have been removed (Tu(-] produces about a 16% quenching of intrinsic tubulin fluorescence. Fluorescence titrations indicate an apparent Kd for the tubulin S6-GTP complex of about 3 X 10(-8)M. Binding of S6-GTP to Tu(-) also produces a change in its absorption spectrum. The observed difference spectrum has a maximum at 350 nm and negative extrema at 323 and 338 nm. This suggests that the environment of the thioguanine ring is relatively hydrophobic. Competitive displacement studies yield apparent Kd values of about 1.7 X 10(-8)M for GTP and 8.3 X 10(-8) M for GDP. The changes in absorbance and fluorescence which accompany binding provide an excellent approach to the study of the kinetics and mechanisms of nucleotide binding as well as studies of the kinetics of displacement of GTP, GDP, and their analogs."

The products of these reactions were characterized and tested for toxicity in vitro and in vivo. All were toxic in vitro, but had lost almost all cytotoxic activity toward HeLa cells. It was possible to show from in vivo protection experiments that modification of the cysteine disulfide in the B-chain interfered with cell surface binding, while modification of the cysteine disulfide linking the A and B domains inhibits a step subsequent to binding in the intoxication process. The latter finding supports a functional role for this interdomain cysteine disulfide in the membrane transport process."
https://openalex.org/W1540978594,"A series of benzyl cyanide analogs have been studied as substrates and inhibitors of dopamine beta-hydroxylase to extend our initial report (Baldoni, J. M., and Villafranca, J. J. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8987-8990) which showed that p-hydroxybenzyl cyanide was a suicide substrate of dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Thus, the appVmax values for benzyl cyanide analogs decrease in the order p-OH greater than m-OH greater than H much greater than p-OCH3,m-OCH3; the m-OH, m-OCH3 and p-OCH3 analogs are competitive inhibitors versus tyramine in initial velocity studies. The Vmax values for tyramine and p-hydroxybenzyl cyanide are nearly identical at saturating O2 and ascorbate (pH 5.0, 37 degrees C) but the Km for O2 is 0.14 and 2.8 mM, respectively, with tyramine and p-hydroxybenzyl cyanide. Studies of the pH dependence of log V/K for tyramine show two pKa values of 5.2 and 5.8 while for m-hydroxybenzyl cyanide the values are 5.3 and 5.9. The log Vmax profile shows one pKa of 5.9 with tyramine as substrate. Thus, nearly identical enzymic groups are involved in binding and/or catalysis with these two substrates. All the benzyl cyanide analogs are suicide inactivators of dopamine beta-hydroxylase. With m-hydroxybenzyl cyanide, the partition between catalysis and inactivation (kcat/kinact) changed from approximately 600 to approximately 17 as the pH varied from 5.0 to 6.7. The log kinact versus pH profile shows one pKa value of 6.0, suggesting that an enzymic group must be deprotonated for maximal inactivation. Copper was essential for the suicide inactivation of dopamine beta-hydroxylase by benzyl cyanides and kinetic studies of partially inhibited dopamine beta-hydroxylase (approximately 50%) showed that inactive enzyme molecules were completely inactive. The following papers in this series discuss the partial reactivation of suicide-inhibited dopamine beta-hydroxylase and the stoichiometry of inactivation by benzyl cyanide analogs."

Localized ConA binding was achieved by the binding of ConA coupled to paraformaldehyde-fixed platelets to mouse spleen lymphocytes. The effect of the localized cross-linking of ConA receptors on the lateral mobility of specific membrane proteins at regions distal to the ConA platelets was investigated. The diffusion of surface immunoglobulins and ConA receptors was inhibited above a threshold coverage (12%) of the upper lymphocyte surface by ConA platelets. In contrast, no effect was observed on the diffusion and aggregation of mouse histocompatibility antigens (H-2Kk) labeled with a fluorescent monoclonal antibody. Since the ConA modulation was shown to propagate through the cytoskeleton, these results indicate specificity in the interactions of membrane proteins with the cytoskeleton.

In order to elucidate this phenomenon, r(C-G-C-G) and r(C-G-C-G-C-G) were synthesized chemically and their properties were examined by UV and CD, and 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy. These ribooligomers form a self-complementary duplex at low temperature, the CD spectrum of which shows a negative band at around 290 nm and a positive band at around 265 nm with almost equal magnitudes. The proton resonances in the 1H NMR spectra of the oligo[r(C-G)] duplexes were assigned by nuclear Overhauser effect experiments. The chemical shift-temperature profiles of the base proton signals and the sharp singlets observed for all H1' protons are consistent with a normal A-RNA structure but not with a Z-DNA like structure. Moreover, a 500-MHz two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect experiment recorded for r(C-G-C-G-C-G) shows that all guanine bases adopt the normal anti-conformation. CD-temperature profiles and 31P NMR spectra of oligo[r(C-G)]s support this conclusion. These results indicate that duplexes of oligo- and polyribonucleotides containing alternating C-G sequences can give an unusually large negative CD band in the long wavelength region despite their right-handed helical structure."
https://openalex.org/W1488110270,"When cultured Drosophila line S3 cells are incubated in the presence of the steroid hormone, ecdysterone, they flatten, elongate, and become motile. We show here that accompanying this morphological transformation there is a 5-fold increase in the rate of actin synthesis and a 2-fold increase in actin content. These increases, in turn, are primarily based on a 9-fold increase in the level of mRNA transcribed from the cytoplasmic actin A3 gene. We also find that during hormone treatment the cells go into proliferative arrest, accumulating in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. During this period the level of histone mRNA in the cells decreases significantly."
https://openalex.org/W1497759540,"The binding of two similar spin-labeled fatty acyl-CoA analogues, one short chain, 6-doxyloctanoyl-CoA (S-(2-(5-carboxybutyl)-2-ethyl-4, 4-dimethyl-3-oxazolidinyl-N-oxyl)-CoA) and one long chain, 6-doxylstearoyl-CoA (S-(2-(5-carboxybutyl)-2-dodecyl-4, 4-dimethyl-3-oxazolidinyl-N-oxyl)-CoA) to pig heart citrate synthase (citrate oxaloacetate-lyase (pro-3S-CH2COO- leads to acetyl-CoA) EC 4.1.3.7) has been compared. The binding of the short chain analogue could be satisfactorily fit by a classical treatment (independent, noninteracting sites) with well defined stoichiometry: 2 mol of spin label bound per mol of dimeric enzyme. Binding of the long chain analogue was complex and in excess of 2 mol/dimer. Competitive binding experiments using either analogue in the presence of various nucleotides and substrates revealed differences in the binding of the long and short chain analogues. These additional studies, together with kinetic measurements, implied isosteric binding of acyl-CoA, ATP, NADPH, NADH, NADP+, acetyl-CoA, and partial isosteric binding of the long chain acyl-CoA. Binding of NADPH and NADP+ to the same form of the enzyme, perhaps through overlapping sites, was kinetically verified even though these nucleotides had differing effects on the binding of the spin-labeled analogues. Oxalacetate was shown to decrease the binding of the long chain analogue but to have no effect on the binding of the short chain. This result was supported by kinetic measurements. The competitive binding experiments with the long chain analogue suggested that its complex isotherm resulted from binding in two classes of sites, i.e. two cooperative nucleotide sites and other sites. An empirical mathematical model employing this rationale provided a satisfactory fit for the binding of fatty acyl-CoA to citrate synthase. A spin-labeled fatty acid which was not bound by the native enzyme was appreciably bound in the presence of additional palmitoyl-CoA. This binding might be identified with one of the two sets of binding sites proposed in the model. These and previous results on acyl-CoA binding were correlated with the properties of the CoA binding site defined crystallographically (Remington, S., Wiegand, G., and Huber, R. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 158, 111-152)."

All of the expected 11 cyanogen bromide fragments of epoxide hydrolase were isolated by a combination of gel filtration and high pressure liquid chromatography. Each was characterized by its amino acid composition and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. The complete amino acid sequences of the eight small fragments, from 5-29 residues, were determined."
https://openalex.org/W1498679844,"Periodate-oxidized ppp(A2'p)3A was coupled in high yield to an acyl hydrazide derivative of bovine serum albumin and the conjugate was used to immunize rabbits. Several potent and specific antisera were obtained, and one was tested extensively. Fifty per cent of the bound probe ppp(A2'p)3A3'[32P]pCp was displaced by compounds containing the moiety -pA2'pA-at concentrations of 20-60 nM and by compounds containing the moiety -p(A2'p)2A- at 1 nM. The 3',5'-oligoadenylate (A3'p)3A was bound more than 10,000 times less tightly than (A2'p)3A. The antiserum can be used in competition assays in which the amount of an antibody-probe complex is measured after binding to Millipore filters or to polystyrene beads. These assays allow the clear detection of as little as 20 fmol (20 microliters of 1 nM) of 2',5'-oligoadenylates."
https://openalex.org/W1606089878,"The flavin prosthetic group (FAD) of the aromatic hydroxylases melilotate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.4) and phenol hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.7) was replaced by 1-deaza-FAD (carbon substituted for nitrogen at position 1). Neither modified enzyme could hydroxylate its substrate, both catalyzed the oxidation of NAD(P)H to NAD(P)+ and H2O2. The rate of the reduction of the enzymes by NAD(P)H was increased by the binding of substrate. Both enzymes formed a detectable flavin C(4a) hydroperoxide intermediate upon reaction of the reduced enzyme-substrate complex with oxygen. Reduced 1-deaza-FAD phenol hydroxylase also showed a detectable C(4a) hydroperoxide intermediate when reacted with oxygen in the absence of substrate. The C(4a) hydroperoxide of 1-deaza-FAD phenol hydroxylase, in the absence of phenol, decayed to an intermediate which showed a perturbed oxidized enzyme spectrum, Eox. This intermediate in turn decayed to give the original oxidized enzyme. In the presence of phenol, a second oxidized species with a perturbed spectrum, intermediate X, was apparent after formation of the flavin C(4a) hydroperoxide and before Eox formation. Steady state kinetic analysis of 1-deaza-FAD phenol hydroxylase demonstrated that the Eox to Eox conversion was not in the catalytic cycle. During turnover Eox was reduced by NADPH."
https://openalex.org/W1489369334,"Several ring-substituted benzyl cyanides lead to inactivation of dopamine beta-hydroxylase during catalysis. With m-hydroxybenzyl cyanide, maximal inactivation occurs when an enzyme group with a pK alpha of 6.0 +/- 0.2 is ionized (Colombo, G., Rajashekhar, B., Giedroc, D. P., and Villafranca, J.J. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 1593-1600). This paper reports studies conducted to determine the stability of inactivated dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Inactivation of the enzyme by m-hydroxybenzyl cyanide at pH 6.4 is halted by lowering the pH to approximately 5.0 with acetate, fumarate, pyridine, or phosphate buffer in the presence of tyramine. However, if tyramine is omitted, reactivation occurs. The extent of reactivation is dependent upon the final pH value and buffer used to adjust the pH. Reactivation is observed as the pH is lowered from 6.4 to below 5.7 with acetate, fumarate, or HCl. With phosphate, reactivation occurs at any pH value from 6.9 to 4.5 but is greater at lower pH values. Thus, inactivation and reactivation have opposite pH dependencies. Also, reactivation is dependent upon the elapsed time of inactivation. At early times, no reactivation is observed when phosphate is used to adjust the pH, but reactivation is observed later in the inactivation reaction. Reactivation to 100% of the original activity does not occur under these conditions. These data suggest at least two inactivation mechanisms by benzyl cyanides: 1) formation of a tightly bound or covalent adduct between dopamine beta-hydroxylase and enzyme-bound mandelonitrile (or a rearranged form of this molecule), and 2) reversible inhibition resulting from cyanide binding to enzyme-Cu2+. Studies with radiolabeled p-hydroxybenzyl cyanide as well as EPR studies of dopamine beta-hydroxylase-Cu2+ are reported in the following paper."
