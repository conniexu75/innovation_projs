https://openalex.org/W2109290881,"Pericytes play a key role in the development of cerebral microcirculation. The exact role of pericytes in the neurovascular unit in the adult brain and during brain aging remains, however, elusive. Using adult viable pericyte-deficient mice, we show that pericyte loss leads to brain vascular damage by two parallel pathways: (1) reduction in brain microcirculation causing diminished brain capillary perfusion, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral blood flow responses to brain activation that ultimately mediates chronic perfusion stress and hypoxia, and (2) blood-brain barrier breakdown associated with brain accumulation of serum proteins and several vasculotoxic and/or neurotoxic macromolecules ultimately leading to secondary neuronal degenerative changes. We show that age-dependent vascular damage in pericyte-deficient mice precedes neuronal degenerative changes, learning and memory impairment, and the neuroinflammatory response. Thus, pericytes control key neurovascular functions that are necessary for proper neuronal structure and function, and pericyte loss results in a progressive age-dependent vascular-mediated neurodegeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2094844506,"In situ hybridization methods enable the mapping of mRNA expression within intact biological samples. With current approaches, it is challenging to simultaneously map multiple target mRNAs within whole-mount vertebrate embryos, representing a significant limitation in attempting to study interacting regulatory elements in systems most relevant to human development and disease. Here, we report a multiplexed fluorescent in situ hybridization method based on orthogonal amplification with hybridization chain reactions (HCR). With this approach, RNA probes complementary to mRNA targets trigger chain reactions in which fluorophore-labeled RNA hairpins self-assemble into tethered fluorescent amplification polymers. The programmability and sequence specificity of these amplification cascades enable multiple HCR amplifiers to operate orthogonally at the same time in the same sample. Robust performance is achieved when imaging five target mRNAs simultaneously in fixed whole-mount and sectioned zebrafish embryos. HCR amplifiers exhibit deep sample penetration, high signal-to-background ratios and sharp signal localization."

Their phylogeographic analysis on a larger dataset of Y. pestis global isolates suggests historical routes of transmission. Plague is a pandemic human invasive disease caused by the bacterial agent Yersinia pestis. We here report a comparison of 17 whole genomes of Y. pestis isolates from global sources. We also screened a global collection of 286 Y. pestis isolates for 933 SNPs using Sequenom MassArray SNP typing. We conducted phylogenetic analyses on this sequence variation dataset, assigned isolates to populations based on maximum parsimony and, from these results, made inferences regarding historical transmission routes. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that Y. pestis evolved in or near China and spread through multiple radiations to Europe, South America, Africa and Southeast Asia, leading to country-specific lineages that can be traced by lineage-specific SNPs. All 626 current isolates from the United States reflect one radiation, and 82 isolates from Madagascar represent a second radiation. Subsequent local microevolution of Y. pestis is marked by sequential, geographically specific SNPs."
https://openalex.org/W2159796957,"Autophagy is often believed to be elevated in disease, contributing to pathogenesis. Paolo Bonaldo and his colleagues now show that it is actually too little autophagy that occurs in some forms of muscular dystrophy, resulting in the continued presence of defective mitochondria and thus myofiber degeneration. They also show that increasing autophagy via dietary or pharmacological means can ameliorate muscle pathology in a mouse model of human muscular dystrophy. Autophagy is crucial in the turnover of cell components, and clearance of damaged organelles by the autophagic-lysosomal pathway is essential for tissue homeostasis. Defects of this degradative system have a role in various diseases, but little is known about autophagy in muscular dystrophies. We have previously found that muscular dystrophies linked to collagen VI deficiency show dysfunctional mitochondria and spontaneous apoptosis, leading to myofiber degeneration. Here we demonstrate that this persistence of abnormal organelles and apoptosis are caused by defective autophagy. Skeletal muscles of collagen VI–knockout (Col6a1−/−) mice had impaired autophagic flux, which matched the lower induction of beclin-1 and BCL-2/adenovirus E1B–interacting protein-3 (Bnip3) and the lack of autophagosomes after starvation. Forced activation of autophagy by genetic, dietary and pharmacological approaches restored myofiber survival and ameliorated the dystrophic phenotype of Col6a1−/− mice. Furthermore, muscle biopsies from subjects with Bethlem myopathy or Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy had reduced protein amounts of beclin-1 and Bnip3. These findings indicate that defective activation of the autophagic machinery is pathogenic in some congenital muscular dystrophies."
https://openalex.org/W2034965090,"Activity of parvalbumin-positive hippocampal interneurons is critical for network synchronization but the receptors involved therein have remained largely unknown. Here we report network and behavioral deficits in mice with selective ablation of NMDA receptors in parvalbumin-positive interneurons (NR1(PVCre-/-)). Recordings of local field potentials and unitary neuronal activity in the hippocampal CA1 area revealed altered theta oscillations (5-10 Hz) in freely behaving NR1(PVCre-/-) mice. Moreover, in contrast to controls, in NR1(PVCre-/-) mice the remaining theta rhythm was abolished by the administration of atropine. Gamma oscillations (35-85 Hz) were increased and less modulated by the concurrent theta rhythm in the mutant. Positional firing of pyramidal cells in NR1(PVCre-/-) mice was less spatially and temporally precise. Finally, NR1(PVCre-/-) mice exhibited impaired spatial working as well as spatial short- and long-term recognition memory but showed no deficits in open field exploratory activity and spatial reference learning."
https://openalex.org/W2000186054,"The motor cortices are active during both movement and movement preparation. A common assumption is that preparatory activity constitutes a subthreshold form of movement activity: a neuron active during rightward movements becomes modestly active during preparation of a rightward movement. We asked whether this pattern of activity is, in fact, observed. We found that it was not: at the level of a single neuron, preparatory tuning was weakly correlated with movement-period tuning. Yet, somewhat paradoxically, preparatory tuning could be captured by a preferred direction in an abstract ""space"" that described the population-level pattern of movement activity. In fact, this relationship accounted for preparatory responses better than did traditional tuning models. These results are expected if preparatory activity provides the initial state of a dynamical system whose evolution produces movement activity. Our results thus suggest that preparatory activity may not represent specific factors, and may instead play a more mechanistic role."

https://openalex.org/W1991625887,"The entorhinal cortex (EC) is one of the earliest affected, most vulnerable brain regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is associated with amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in many brain areas. Selective overexpression of mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) predominantly in layer II/III neurons of the EC caused cognitive and behavioral abnormalities characteristic of mouse models with widespread neuronal APP overexpression, including hyperactivity, disinhibition, and spatial learning and memory deficits. APP/Aβ overexpression in the EC elicited abnormalities in synaptic functions and activity-related molecules in the dentate gyrus and CA1 and epileptiform activity in parietal cortex. Soluble Aβ was observed in the dentate gyrus, and Aβ deposits in the hippocampus were localized to perforant pathway terminal fields. Thus, APP/Aβ expression in EC neurons causes transsynaptic deficits that could initiate the cortical-hippocampal network dysfunction in mouse models and human patients with AD."
https://openalex.org/W1976665194,"It has been proposed that a single sniff generates a ""snapshot"" of the olfactory world. However, odor coding on this timescale is poorly understood, and it is not known whether coding is invariant to changes in respiration frequency. We investigated this by recording spike trains from the olfactory bulb in awake, behaving rats. During rapid sniffing, odor inhalation triggered rapid and reliable cell- and odor-specific temporal spike patterns. These fine temporal responses conveyed substantial odor information within the first ∼100 ms, and correlated with behavioral discrimination time on a trial-by-trial basis. Surprisingly, the initial transient portions of responses were highly conserved between rapid sniffing and slow breathing. Firing rates over the entire respiration cycle carried less odor information, did not correlate with behavior, and were poorly conserved across respiration frequency. These results suggest that inhalation-coupled transient activity forms a robust neural code that is invariant to changes in respiration behavior."

Motor neurons are grouped into motor neuron pools, the functional units innervating individual muscles. Here we establish an anatomical rabies virus-based connectivity assay in early postnatal mice.

First, motor neuron pools are connected to segmentally widely distributed yet stereotypic interneuron populations, differing for pools innervating functionally distinct muscles. Second, depending on subpopulation identity, interneurons take on local or segmentally distributed positions. Third, cholinergic partition cells involved in the regulation of motor neuron excitability segregate into ipsilaterally and bilaterally projecting populations, the latter exhibiting preferential connections to functionally equivalent motor neuron pools bilaterally.

The firing of an individual neuron within a neural circuit is dictated by the timed activity of its presynaptic neuronal population. Much progress has been made investigating the rules and properties of connections between identified neuronal pairs using electrophysiological and anatomical approaches (Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008Klausberger T. Somogyi P. Neuronal diversity and temporal dynamics: the unity of hippocampal circuit operations.Science. 2008; 321: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, Sakmann, 2006Sakmann B. Patch pipettes are more useful than initially thought: simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic recording from mammalian CNS synapses in vitro and in vivo.Pflugers Arch. 2006; 453: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), advancing our understanding of how specific synaptic connections contribute to circuit activity and function. However, the enormous diversity in distinct presynaptic neuronal subtypes and the fact that cell body location of interconnected neurons is often at a far distance make the comprehension of the overall connectivity scheme of large cohorts of neurons a challenging task. In the motor system, muscle contractions are controlled by the timed activation of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Coherent locomotor sequences are achieved by temporally appropriate recruitment of motor neurons through the activity of presynaptic neurons. In vertebrates, individual muscles are innervated by motor neuron pools, the cell bodies of which are clustered in stereotypic positions in the ventral horn of the spinal cord (McHanwell and Biscoe, 1981McHanwell S. Biscoe T.J. The localization of motoneurons supplying the hindlimb muscles of the mouse.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Brain Res. 1964; 11: 93-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The motor neuron pool is therefore a critical functional unit in the organization of the motor output system. Because its activity is controlled by the cohort of premotor neurons, the last-order neurons establishing direct synaptic connections, understanding the connectivity rules of defined premotor interneurons to functionally distinct motor neuron pools is essential for understanding the organization of the motor output system. Many different spinal interneuron populations with direct connections to motor neurons have been described, using electrophysiological, anatomical, and genetic approaches. Electrophysiological studies have categorized premotor interneurons on the basis of excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitter identity, ipsilateral versus contralateral cell body position, and presynaptic input from sensory, descending, or other sources, leading to models of connectivity diagrams encompassing the core circuits driving motor output (Grillner, 2006Grillner S.

Two prime examples of interneuron populations for which a high degree of synaptic specificity has been observed are the Renshaw cells establishing an inhibitory feedback loop to motor neurons (Alvarez and Fyffe, 2007Alvarez F.J.

In recent years, these studies were complemented by a systematic analysis of distinct spinal interneuron classes derived from four transcriptionally defined progenitor domains in the ventral spinal cord (Jessell, 2000Jessell T.M. Neuronal specification in the spinal cord: inductive signals and transcriptional codes.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). These studies have begun to assign functional roles to interneuron classes in locomotor output circuitry based on developmental ontogeny (Goulding, 2009Goulding M.

Nevertheless, and in part due to the extensive three-dimensional (3D) nature of the connectivity matrix, overall distribution patterns and connection specificity of premotor neurons to defined motor neuron pools are known for remarkably few of these either electrophysiologically or genetically defined premotor populations, prompting us to develop a connectivity-based anatomical assay to begin to address these questions. The use of a variety of retrogradely and anterogradely spreading transsynaptic viruses expressing fluorescent marker proteins or other transneuronally transported tracers has permitted anatomical visualization of connectivity within neuronal circuits (Ekstrand et al., 2008Ekstrand M.I.

Published online January 5, 2010)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2009.12.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Because these viruses cross multiple synapses, unambiguous identification of monosynaptically connected presynaptic neurons has remained difficult. To overcome this problem, a rabies virus-based transsynaptic system with exclusive retrograde direction has been developed recently, allowing the visualization of monosynaptically connected presynaptic neurons in the cortex (Marshel et al., 2010Marshel J.H.

Monosynaptic restriction of transsynaptic tracing from single, genetically targeted neurons.Neuron. 2007; 53: 639-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The system makes use of a modified rabies virus with a genomic substitution in the gene encoding the envelope glycoprotein (G protein) essential for transsynaptic spreading by a fluorescent marker protein. G protein deletion does not interfere with virus production in primarily infected neurons, but subsequent infection of presynaptic neurons can only be achieved by complementation with G protein expression (Marshel et al., 2010Marshel J.H.

One main goal of this study was to adapt this transsynaptic rabies virus technology to its application in the motor system by targeting primary infection and thus the source of retrograde spread to the motor neuron pool as a defined functional unit. In this study, we develop a method to visualize premotor interneuron populations connected to motor neuron pools using retrograde double-virus infection from defined target muscles in early postnatal mice. We employ this method (1) to determine and probe the reproducibility of 3D premotor interneuron distributions, (2) to visualize the local or distributed nature of defined premotor interneuron subpopulations, and (3) to determine distribution and connectivity rules of cholinergic premotor partition cells, known to regulate motor neuron excitability through C-bouton synapses with motor neurons (Conradi and Skoglund, 1969Conradi S.

A cluster of cholinergic premotor interneurons modulates mouse locomotor activity.Neuron. 2009; 64: 645-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We find that virally labeled premotor spinal interneurons exhibit highly reproducible and segmentally widespread distribution patterns, but these patterns can be distinct for premotor interneurons connecting to motor neuron pools with different functions. Within the cohort of premotor interneurons, defined populations (Renshaw cells, Lhx3- or Isl1-derived interneurons) display cell type-specific distribution patterns. Analysis of connectivity between cholinergic partition cells and motor neurons reveals the existence of ipsilaterally and bilaterally projecting populations, both with widespread rostro-caudal segmental origin, and the latter with preferential connectivity to equivalent motor neuron pools bilaterally. Our study establishes the use of monosynaptically restricted rabies viruses in the motor system, determines the connectivity matrix in the motor output system at high resolution, and makes use of this method to reveal rules of synaptic specificity of one defined premotor interneuron population. To determine whether glycoprotein-deficient rabies virus expressing mCherry (Rab-mCherry) can infect spinal motor neurons retrogradely, we targeted viral injections to identified limb muscles of mice and analyzed mCherry expression in the spinal cord several days after muscle injections (Figure 1A ). We focused our initial analysis on injections of the Quadriceps (Q) muscle, a dorsal thigh muscle of the hindlimb. Two to three days after injection, we observed retrogradely labeled motor neurons at lumbar (L) levels L3–L4 (Figures 1B and 1C) in the spinal cord, in agreement with the described Q motor neuron pool position (McHanwell and Biscoe, 1981McHanwell S. Biscoe T.J. The localization of motoneurons supplying the hindlimb muscles of the mouse.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1981; 293: 477-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Expression of mCherry remained confined to ChATon motor neurons and no interneurons were detected upon Q intramuscular Rab-mCherry injections (n = 6), but motoneuronal dendritic morphology was readily detected (Figure 1C). We found that spinal motor neurons persisted for at least 12 days after muscle injections, but thereafter started to degenerate, a time course similar to previous observations in cortical slice experiments (Wickersham et al., 2007bWickersham I.R. Lyon D.C. Barnard R.J. Mori T. Finke S. Conzelmann K.K. Young J.A. Callaway E.M. Monosynaptic restriction of transsynaptic tracing from single, genetically targeted neurons.Neuron. 2007; 53: 639-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). We only observed successful retrograde infection of motor neurons by intramuscular rabies injection from postnatal day (p) p0 to approximately p10, after which the efficiency of infection declined dramatically (data not shown). We therefore carried out further injections at p7, a stage >10 days after cessation of neuronal birth in the spinal cord and at which many local functional connections to motor neurons are established (Goulding, 2009Goulding M.

Early postnatal development of reciprocal Ia inhibition in the murine spinal cord.J. Neurophysiol. 2008; 100: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We next developed a strategy permitting us to restrict expression of G protein to motor neurons infected by Rab-mCherry, but avoiding G protein expression in spinal interneurons. To confine G protein expression to motor neurons innervating muscles injected by Rab-mCherry, we made use of the observation that the replication-incompetent adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 6 efficiently delivers transgenes to motor neurons through retrograde infection (Towne et al., 2010Towne C. Schneider B.L. Kieran D. Redmond Jr., D.E. Aebischer P. Efficient transduction of non-human primate motor neurons after intramuscular delivery of recombinant AAV serotype 6.Gene Ther. 2010; 17: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Using the same approach, we produced an AAV expressing G protein (AAV-G protein), coinjected it with Rab-mCherry virus into the same muscle (Figure 1D), and analyzed mCherry expression in the spinal cord 8 days after coinjection of the two viruses. We found that in addition to ChATon Q motor neurons, many interneurons were now fluorescently labeled, also several spinal segments away from the source motor neuron pool (Figures 1E–1G; n = 6). These findings indicate that the Rab-mCherry virus can be complemented successfully by the AAV-delivered G protein to acquire transsynaptic spreading activity. In animals coinjected with AAV-G protein and Rab-mCherry, the intensity of fluorescent protein expression in interneurons was similar to that of motor neurons in animals injected only with Rab-mCherry (Figure 1F), underscoring the transcriptional independence of the rabies virus system from host cells (Wickersham et al., 2007aWickersham I.R.

Transsynaptically marked premotor neurons form a dense network of axonal ramifications in the vicinity of labeled motor neurons (Figure 1H), consistent with their connectivity with motor neurons (Figure 1E). In a time course analysis, we found that the first interneurons were visible 6 days after coinjection, and peak numbers of labeled neurons were observed after 8 days. To avoid neuronal degeneration due to long-term rabies virus infection, we therefore carried out further experiments 8 days after intramuscular injections. To begin to probe the robustness and reliability of the method, we injected Q muscles bilaterally in individual mice with rabies viruses expressing fluorescent markers of different colors (Figure 2A ). Using Rab-mCherry (right side) and Rab-GFP (left side) viruses, each in combination with AAV-G protein injection, we found that in these doubly rabies virus-injected mice, spinal interneurons labeled by Rab-mCherry and Rab-eGFP were distributed in a bilaterally symmetrical pattern (Figures 2A and 2B). Artificial superimposition of images acquired from Rab-mCherry injections and mirrored images from Rab-eGFP injections displayed in distinct colors showed clustering of neurons in similar domains within the spinal cord (Figure 2C). In particular, the majority of ipsilateral interneurons were found in Rexed laminae VI, VII, and X, while contralateral interneurons were mainly confined to Rexed lamina VIII and ventro-medial lamina VII (Figures 2B and 2C). This contralateral population included both excitatory (vGlut2on) and inhibitory (GAD67on) interneurons (Figure 3L ), consistent with previous observations (Bannatyne et al., 2003Bannatyne B.A. Edgley S.A.

https://openalex.org/W2078187429,"Itch can be suppressed by painful stimuli, but the underlying neural basis is unknown. We generated conditional null mice in which vesicular glutamate transporter type 2 (VGLUT2)-dependent synaptic glutamate release from mainly Nav1.8-expressing nociceptors was abolished. These mice showed deficits in pain behaviors, including mechanical pain, heat pain, capsaicin-evoked pain, inflammatory pain, and neuropathic pain. The pain deficits were accompanied by greatly enhanced itching, as suggested by (1) sensitization of both histamine-dependent and histamine-independent itch pathways and (2) development of spontaneous scratching and skin lesions. Strikingly, intradermal capsaicin injection promotes itch responses in these mutant mice, as opposed to pain responses in control littermates. Consequently, coinjection of capsaicin was no longer able to mask itch evoked by pruritogenic compounds. Our studies suggest that synaptic glutamate release from a group of peripheral nociceptors is required to sense pain and suppress itch. Elimination of VGLUT2 in these nociceptors creates a mouse model of chronic neurogenic itch."
https://openalex.org/W1986627859,"Homeostatic processes have been proposed to explain the discrepancy between the dynamics of synaptic plasticity and the stability of brain function. Forms of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation alter synaptic activity in a synapse- and cell-specific fashion. Although network-wide excitation triggers compensatory homeostatic changes, it is unknown whether neurons initiate homeostatic synaptic changes in response to cell-autonomous increases in excitation. Here we employ optogenetic tools to cell-autonomously excite CA1 pyramidal neurons and find that a compensatory postsynaptic depression of both AMPAR and NMDAR function results. Elevated calcium influx through L-type calcium channels leads to activation of a pathway involving CaM kinase kinase and CaM kinase 4 that induces synaptic depression of AMPAR and NMDAR responses. The synaptic depression of AMPARs but not of NMDARs requires protein synthesis and the GluA2 AMPAR subunit, indicating that downstream of CaM kinase activation divergent pathways regulate homeostatic AMPAR and NMDAR depression."

Using functional imaging, we identified a topographically organized body part map within the occipitotemporal cortex (OTC), with distinct clusters of voxels showing clear preference for different visually presented body parts. This representation was consistent both across hemispheres and participants. Using converging methods, the preference for specific body parts was demonstrated to be robust and did not merely reflect shape differences between the categories. Finally, execution of (unseen) movements with different body parts resulted in a limited topographic representation of the limbs and trunk, which partially overlapped with the visual body part map. This motor-driven activation in the OTC could not be explained solely by visual or motor imagery of the body parts. This suggests that visual and motor-related information converge within the OTC in a body part specific manner.

Functional mapping of seen body parts in the ventral visual pathway Clusters of voxels showing preference for images of a specific body part category The body part selectivity was not largely determined by shape similarity Self-initiated actions elicit similar body part representations in the same regions One of the most robust organizational principles in the brain is the topographic mapping of the body in the somatosensory and motor systems. According to this principle, neighboring neurons encode functional properties of the same body part. In the primary somatosensory cortex, this local rule results in a fine-scale orderly map, in which the stimulated body part can be identified, based on the locus of the neuronal population activity (Marshall et al., 1937Marshall W.H.

Specifically, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have identified two separate regions which are specialized for representing the body: the extrastriate body area (EBA), and the fusiform body area (FBA). These two areas selectively respond to images of the whole body (as well as of nonfacial body parts) compared to other object categories (Downing et al., 2001Downing P.E. Jiang Y. Shuman M.

Recent evidence suggests that some specificity at the subordinate category level may also exist between nonfacial body parts (e.g., upper limbs and torso), both within EBA (Chan et al., 2010Chan A.W. Kravitz D.J. Truong S. Arizpe J. Baker C.I. Cortical representations of bodies and faces are strongest in commonly experienced configurations.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 417-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and across the OTC (Op de Beeck et al., 2010Op de Beeck H.P. Brants M. Baeck A. Wagemans J. Distributed subordinate specificity for bodies, faces, and buildings in human ventral visual cortex.Neuroimage. 2010; 49: 3414-3425Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This functional distinction naturally raises the possibility that different body parts may be mapped in the OTC in an orderly manner. We therefore looked for evidence for a systematic organization of body parts (i.e., an orderly map) in the visual cortex. To that end, participants viewed images of body parts during fMRI scans, using phase encoding and block design experiments. We found a consistent gross topographic representation of body parts in the OTC, with distinguishable clusters for separate body parts. Next, given that a likely organizing principle of higher-level visual cortex involves shape attributes (Tanaka, 1996Tanaka K. Inferotemporal cortex and object vision.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 109-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, Kourtzi and Kanwisher, 2001Kourtzi Z. Kanwisher N. Representation of perceived object shape by the human lateral occipital complex.Science. 2001; 293: 1506-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), we tested whether the shape of the different body parts may underlie selectivity in the body map. We found that the visual preference to particular body parts in OTC is not likely to be explained solely by shape differences between body parts. Finally, we examined whether this topographic organization is based exclusively on visual information. Recent fMRI studies show that unseen movements activate the OTC (Astafiev et al., 2004Astafiev S.V. Stanley C.M. Shulman G.L. Corbetta M.

Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 1077-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether this activation is body part specific. We found that unseen movements performed by different body parts activated different subregions within the visual body map in the OTC. The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses for the different body parts when presented visually were significantly correlated with the BOLD responses during the execution of movements with the same body parts. This suggests a shared topographic representation of seen and moved body parts in the OTC. To identify potential visual body maps, we used the phase encoding fMRI technique (Bandettini et al., 1993Bandettini P.A. Jesmanowicz A. Wong E.C. Hyde J.S.

Brain Mapp. 2003; 18: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Participants viewed a symmetric “double wedge,” rotating around the central fixation (completing a full cycle in 48 s). This double wedge contained pictures of five different body part categories (Figure 1A and see Figure S1A available online), presented sequentially in a fixed order, such that a cycle of all body parts was completed in 30 s (Figure 1B). In order to obtain a better signal-to-noise ratio and to eliminate biases resulting from presentation order, this experimental design was repeated in three to four runs, using either a reversed or a shuffled sequence of body part presentation, relative to the initial sequence. Figure 2A demonstrates the voxel-by-voxel cross-correlation analysis which was used to construct the individual body maps. A hemodynamically convolved reference function (HRF, predictor, blue) was systematically shifted along a run to identify the lag that produced the maximal cross-correlation coefficient (r value) with the raw BOLD signal (black) (Friston et al., 1998Friston K.J. Fletcher P. Josephs O. Holmes A. Rugg M.D. Turner R. Event-related fMRI: Characterizing differential responses.Neuroimage. 1998; 7: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). The resulting r values for each time lag within a body part cycle are presented in Figure 2B. Each row corresponds to a different voxel, shown here for illustration purposes (the upper row shows data from the voxel presented in Figure 2A). Each column corresponds to a different run, with a different body part presentation order, and their average (across runs; rightmost column). The preferred body part was then selected for each voxel, based on the corresponding lag with the highest mean r value (across all runs; a “winner-take-all” approach). (A) Cross-correlation analysis: The raw BOLD signal of each voxel (black line for an example voxel) was correlated with a cyclic ideal HRF (predictor, blue line). The predictor was systematically shifted in time (in regular steps of 2 s along the cycle) to identify the lag that produced the best match (maximal r value) with the voxel's raw BOLD signal (lag of 2 s in this example). The cyclic body part protocol is shown in the upper panel (blue, “lower face and neck”; green, “upper face”; yellow, “upper limbs”; red, “trunk”; and pink, “lower limbs”). (B) The resulting r values from the cross-correlation analysis in five example voxels with different body part preferences (positions are shown as black open squares in C) across three different runs (1, 2, 3) and their average (AV). The runs varied in their presentation order in the body part cycle (color code as in A). The black graph shows the resulting r value, as a function of the time lag within a body part cycle. Note that these data are presented for illustration purposes only and should not be interpreted as an indication of the consistency of the data across runs. (C) The resulting body part map in one example participant, from a posterior lateral view (top) and a ventral viewpoint (bottom). The color of each voxel in the map was assigned according to the body part in the cycle that yielded the highest r value in the cross-correlation analysis (taking into account the delay in the hemodynamic response). Only voxels whose best mean r value was above the threshold (r = 0.26, based on q(FDR) < 0.001, solid black line in AV column, B) were included in the map. Note that contiguous clusters of voxels on the map showed preference for the same body part. White solid lines indicate the borders of retinotopic areas (defined using the polar mapping data of this participant, from the same dataset). The white dashed lines depict the boundaries of EBA and FBA (from the separate EBA localizer scan, p < 0.001, cluster size corrected). (D) A body part preference-strength map. Here, the color scale for each voxel indicates the difference between the maximal r values for the preferred and the second-best category. Note that lower difference values (red) are often found at the borders between the clusters (denoted by black lines), indicating a smooth transition between the body part selectivity of neighboring clusters. LH and RH, left and right hemispheres, respectively; STS, superior temporal sulcus; CoS, collateral sulcus. For other body part individual maps, as well as non-body object maps, see Figure S2. Figure 2C shows the resulting body part map that was generated for an example participant, by coloring each voxel according to its preferred body part. The body part maps of all other participants are shown in Figure S2A (upper map of the two maps plotted for each participant). Only voxels in which the correlation coefficient (at the best lag) was greater than the threshold (false discovery rate (FDR), q < 0.001) were included in the individual maps (r value thresholds between 0.26 and 0.28 across participants). The resulting maps, with significant voxels located almost exclusively in the OTC, showed clear signs of patchiness at a coarse spatial scale, suggesting that voxels showing preference for a specific body part are not randomly distributed within the OTC. To visualize the strength of each voxel's body part preference, we plotted the difference between the r value (at the best lag) corresponding to the preferred category, and the r value corresponding to the second best category, using a continuous scale (Figure 2D, and lower maps in Figure S2A). Typically, this difference decreased toward the borders of each body part cluster, suggesting a smooth transition between body part preferences in neighboring clusters. To exclude the possibility that the mapping in the OTC could be generalized to nonbody objects, participants also viewed images of object parts (rather than body parts) in a separate, identical phase encoding design, (Figure S2B). No consistent representation was observed for each of the object parts, let alone a full object map. Next, to test whether the body part representation was consistent across participants, we calculated a group body part map. This was done by averaging (across participants) the individual r values for each lag in each standard-space voxel (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988Talairach J. Tournoux P. Co-Planar Stereotaxic Atlas of the Human Brain. Thieme, Stuttgart, Germany1988Google Scholar). We then chose voxels whose best group r value was greater than the threshold (r = 0.15; matching the FDR criterion used for the individual maps, q < 0.001). The resulting map is presented in Figure 3 (see also Figure S3 and Table 1), in which the color index shows the preferred body part on the basis of the maximal r value across participants. The group body part map demonstrates a consistent topographic organization, which was restricted to the OTC bilaterally, with separate clusters showing preference for each body part at the group level. To construct the group-averaged body part map, individual mean cross-correlation coefficients (as in column AV in Figure 2) were averaged across participants in standard space voxels. The resulting map (shown on the cortical surface of a representative participant) includes only statistically significant voxels (r > 0.15, q(FDR) < 0.001). Colors in the group map thus indicate the preference of each voxel for a certain body part across participants (see colored icons). These voxels were almost exclusively located in the OTC. The white dashed lines depict the boundaries of EBA and FBA across participants (as defined by an independent EBA localizer, random effects analysis, p < 0.05, cluster size corrected). For a masked group map, taking into account the comparison between intact and scrambled body part images, see Figure S3. Representations of the upper face (green clusters) resided in the well-known OFA and FFA bilaterally, with additional small clusters near the superior temporal sulcus. The coordinates of the center of mass of these clusters were similar to those described in other fMRI studies (Haxby et al., 2001Haxby J.V. Gobbini M.I. Furey M.L. Ishai A. Schouten J.L. Pietrini P. Distributed and overlapping representations of faces and objects in ventral temporal cortex.Science. 2001; 293: 2425-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar, Kanwisher et al., 1997Kanwisher N. McDermott J. Chun M.M. The fusiform face area: a module in human extrastriate cortex specialized for face perception.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4302-4311PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, we found adjacent but separate clusters (in blue) showing selective preference to images of the lower face and neck. These clusters were found bilaterally in the OFA and in the right FFA, mostly between the “upper face” clusters and the “upper limbs” or “trunk” clusters. The “upper limbs” representation (yellow clusters) was located in the dorsolateral OTC in both hemispheres (with the center of mass at the border between the medial occipital and inferior temporal gyri). A much smaller representation was also restricted to the occipitotemporal sulcus of the left hemisphere. The “trunk” and “lower limbs” clusters (in red and purple, respectively) were distributed between the dorsal and ventral aspects of the lateral OTC. In the dorsal OTC, these clusters adjoined the main “upper limbs” representation from both the ventral and dorsal sides. To verify the body part preference shown using the phase encoding paradigm, we ran an independent block design experiment, consisting of centrally presented images from the five body part categories in different blocks (Figures 1D and S1A) as well as their scrambled versions (serving as a “baseline” condition). For each of the eleven participants that took part in this experiment, we defined body part-selective ROIs within bilateral OTC, based on the voxels' preference in the phase encoding experiment (“winner-take-all” approach; Figures 2C and S2A, upper maps). These ROIs included any voxels that met the statistical criterion for significance in the phase encoding experiment (FDR, q < 0.001), including voxels in both the lateral and ventral surfaces of the OTC. We then examined the body part-related activation levels (beta values) derived from the block design experiment. The bars in Figures 4A and 4B show the activation levels for the example participant and the group mean (respectively), for each of the five body part categories within each ROI (left, y axis). The black line superimposed on the bars shows the individual and group mean r values, derived from the phase encoding experiment (right, y axis). Crucially, the activation levels from the independent block design experiment showed the same pattern of preference for each of the five ROIs. First, the mean activation level for the preferred body part in each ROI was significantly greater than the activation level for the second-best category (paired t test, p < 0.001 for the “upper limbs” ROI, p < 0.01 for the “upper face,” “trunk,” and “lower limbs” ROIs, and p < 0.05 for the “lower face and neck” ROI). Moreover, the general pattern of activation in the ROIs for the different body parts was highly consistent across the two experiments on a participant by participant basis, as reflected in a highly significant correlation between these two estimates (see Figure 4C; mean r values between 0.89–0.95, p < 0.001 for all ROIs, random coefficients model; for more detail, see Table S2A). Thus, the preference of individual clusters for specific body parts that we demonstrated using the phase encoding approach, was clearly replicated, both within and across participants, using the independent block design approach. Analysis of the activation pattern, derived from block design 1, in the body part selective ROIs of the example participant (A), presented in Figure 2 and mean group (B). Each body part ROI was defined for each participant based on the phase encoding experiment. Each row corresponds to a ROI with a different body part preference (as indicated by the icons). Graphs (black line, right y axis) show the resulting cross-correlation r value (averaged over all the voxels of each ROI) as a function of the body part cycle lag. Bars (left y axis) show the mean activation levels (beta values) of voxels within the same ROI, derived from the independent block design 1 experiment. Bar colors correspond to the different body parts (see index below the bottom graph in A). Note that the pattern of preference for the different body parts was remarkably similar across the two experiments. This was the case both for the example participant (A) and for the group average (B), in which the error bars indicate SEM. (C) Scatter plots depicting individual r values (averaged across the three lags for each of the body part categories, x axis) and beta values (y axis) in each ROI, in the two independent experiments. Different symbols correspond to different participants. Black lines indicate individual participants' regression slopes. Colored diamonds and the orange line correspond to the BOLD estimates and slope of the participant shown in (A). The two measures were highly correlated in each ROI (mean r values between 0.89-0.95, all p's < 0.001, random coefficients model). This strongly supports the notion of a topographic representation of different body parts in distinct clusters in the OTC. Next, we tested whether the preference for particular body parts within the body part map could simply be determined by differences in stimulus shape. In a separate block design experiment, each of the original body categories was further divided into two different and distinct subcategories (e.g., the upper limb was divided into “hand” and “elbow,” upper face into “eyes” and “nose,” etc.; Figure 1E and Figure S1B). In each of the previously defined body part ROIs, we assessed the activation levels elicited by each of these ten subcategories (Figure 5A , rows). In all ROIs, the highest level of activation occurred during viewing of the two subcategory parts that comprised its original preferred body part (e.g., the “upper limbs” ROI was activated most strongly by images of hands and elbows). We also examined, within each ROI and for each participant, the extent to which the activation elicited by each subcategory (e.g., “hands”) was correlated with the activation level to its paired subcategory (e.g., “elbows”). The analyses included all 16 combinations of pairing of the 5 subparts within each ROI. We found a highly significant correlation between the activation levels for the two subcategories in all ROIs, even though the subcategories that comprised the original category were often quite different in their shape characteristics (group mean r values between 0.67 and 0.93, p's < 0.001 for all possible combinations in all ROIs, random coefficients model; Table S2B; see details in Experimental Procedures). It is therefore reasonable to assume that the specificity for body parts is not merely due to shape differences between the various categories. (A) Analysis of the BOLD activation levels in the various body part selective ROIs for different body part subcategories (used in block design 2). Each row corresponds to a specific ROI with a different body part preference, defined according to the individual body part maps from the phase encoding experiment. Bars show the group mean activation levels (beta values) for ten new body part subcategories, two from each of the five original body part categories. Note that paired subcategories (of the same body part category) have distinctly different shapes. However, the activation profiles are very similar in the left and right columns, each including one subcategory of each of the five body parts. This can best be appreciated when comparing the activation level for each subcategory (e.g., hands) with the activation level to its paired subcategory (elbows) across participants. (B) Scatter plots depicting individual activation levels for one set of subcategories (set 1, lips [L], eyes [Ey], hands [H], chest [Ct], and feet [F]; x axis) versus the activation elicited by the complementary set of subcategories (set 2: chin [Cn], nose [N], elbows [El], buttocks [B], and knees [Kn], respectively; y axis). Notations are as in Figure 4C. The two measures were significantly correlated in each ROI (group mean r values between 0.67 and 0.93, p's < 0.001 for all possible combinations in all ROIs, random coefficients model). The body part-selective ROIs do not show obvious selectivity to particular shapes. Rather, they show selectivity to the body part category which is preserved at the subcategory level. For the dissociation between body parts and nonbody (objects or houses) categories in the OTC, see Figure S4. To delineate the boundaries of EBA (and FBA), we applied a standard localizer test using a block design experiment (Downing et al., 2001Downing P.E. Jiang Y. Shuman M. Kanwisher N. A cortical area selective for visual processing of the human body.Science. 2001; 293: 2470-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar, Downing et al., 2006Downing P.E. Chan A.W.-Y. Peelen M.V.

The regions delineated by the white dashed line in the group map (Figure 3) and in the individual maps (Figures 2C and S2A) indicate areas that were activated significantly more strongly during presentation of images of whole bodies or body parts as compared to objects. In general, the body maps extend well beyond the locus of EBA/FBA, with EBA largely overlapping with “upper limbs” selective clusters. In contrast, FBA mostly overlapped with the face representation in the average map (although this was less consistent in the individual results; Figure S2). We further characterized the degree to which voxels in the OTC showed preference to i"

Long GAA⋅TTC repeats cause heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing and loss of frataxin in affected individuals. We report the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from FRDA patient fibroblasts by transcription factor reprogramming. FXN gene repression is maintained in the iPSCs, as are the global gene expression signatures reflecting the human disease. GAA⋅TTC repeats uniquely in FXN in the iPSCs exhibit repeat instability similar to patient families, where they expand and/or contract with discrete changes in length between generations. The mismatch repair enzyme MSH2, implicated in repeat instability in other triplet repeat diseases, is highly expressed in pluripotent cells and occupies FXN intron 1, and shRNA silencing of MSH2 impedes repeat expansion, providing a possible molecular explanation for repeat expansion in FRDA."
https://openalex.org/W2028536961,"The natural response to itch sensation is to scratch, which relieves the itch through an unknown mechanism. Interaction between pain and itch has been frequently demonstrated, and the selectivity hypothesis of itch, based on data from electrophysiological and behavioral experiments, postulates the existence of primary pain afferents capable of repressing itch. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) 2 in a subpopulation of neurons partly overlapping with the vanilloid receptor (TRPV1) primary afferents resulted in a dramatic increase in itch behavior accompanied by a reduced responsiveness to thermal pain. The increased itch behavior was reduced by administration of antihistaminergic drugs and by genetic deletion of the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, demonstrating a dependence on VGLUT2 to maintain normal levels of both histaminergic and nonhistaminergic itch. This study establishes that VGLUT2 is a major player in TRPV1 thermal nociception and also serves to regulate a normal itch response."

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) pathway signaling promotes cell growth, proliferation, and survival by several mechanisms (see Figure S1 available online for a schematic; Wullschleger et al., 2006Wullschleger S.

PI3K pathway alterations in cancer: Variations on a theme.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5497-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). PIP3 activates Akt, which promotes cell growth, proliferation, and survival by phosphorylating diverse substrates (Manning and Cantley, 2007Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. AKT/PKB signaling: Navigating downstream.Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar), including the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (Inoki et al., 2002Inoki K.

Phosphorylation by Akt negatively regulates TSC, leading to the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase (Inoki et al., 2002Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L.

PI3-kinase signaling is attenuated by Pten, which dephosphorylates PIP3 (Maehama and Dixon, 1998Maehama T. Dixon J.E. The tumor suppressor, PTEN/MMAC1, dephosphorylates the lipid second messenger, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar), reducing the activation of Akt, mTORC1, and S6 kinase. As a result, Pten deficiency increases the growth, proliferation, and survival of many cells (Sun et al., 1999Sun H. Lesche R. Li D.-M. Liliental J. Zhang H. Gao J. Gavrilova N. Mueller B. Liu X. Wu H. PTEN modulates cell cycle progression and cell survival by regulating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate and Akt/protein kinase B signaling pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

PI3-kinase pathway signaling has divergent effects on stem cells. Conditional deletion of Pten from embryonic stem cells and neural stem cells increases cell cycle entry and self-renewal (Gregorian et al., 2009Gregorian C. Nakashima J. Le Belle J. Ohab J. Kim R.

USA. 1999; 96: 6199-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In contrast, Pten deletion from adult HSCs increases cell cycle entry but this leads to rapid HSC depletion (Yilmaz et al., 2006Yilmaz O.H. Valdez R. Theisen B.K. Guo W. Ferguson D.O. Wu H. Morrison S.J.

Wiedemann L.M. et al.PTEN maintains haematopoietic stem cells and acts in lineage choice and leukaemia prevention.Nature. 2006; 441: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). We showed that this depletion was mediated by mTOR activation as rapamycin blocked the depletion of Pten-deficient HSCs (Yilmaz et al., 2006Yilmaz O.H. Valdez R. Theisen B.K. Guo W. Ferguson D.O. Wu H. Morrison S.J. Pten dependence distinguishes haematopoietic stem cells from leukaemia-initiating cells.Nature. 2006; 441: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies of Tsc1-deficient HSCs confirmed that increased PI3-kinase pathway signaling can drive HSCs into cycle but that this leads to mTOR-mediated HSC depletion (Chen et al., 2008Chen C. Liu Y. Liu R. Ikenoue T. Guan K.L. Liu Y. Zheng P. TSC-mTOR maintains quiescence and function of hematopoietic stem cells by repressing mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive oxygen species.J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 2397-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, Gan et al., 2008Gan B. Sahin E. Jiang S. Sanchez-Aguilera A. Scott K.L. Chin L. Williams D.A. Kwiatkowski D.J.

USA. 2008; 105: 19384-19389Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Pml deletion also increased HSC cycling and led to mTOR-mediated HSC depletion (Ito et al., 2008Ito K. Bernardi R. Morotti A. Matsuoka S. Saglio G. Ikeda Y. Rosenblatt J. Avigan D.E. Teruya-Feldstein J. Pandolfi P.P. PML targeting eradicates quiescent leukaemia-initiating cells.Nature. 2008; 453: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). mTOR is thus a critical modulator of stem cell maintenance, raising the question of how mTOR activation leads to stem cell depletion. While Pten deletion leads to the depletion of normal HSCs, this leads to the generation and expansion of leukemia-initiating cells (Yilmaz et al., 2006Yilmaz O.H. Valdez R. Theisen B.K. Guo W. Ferguson D.O. Wu H. Morrison S.J. Pten dependence distinguishes haematopoietic stem cells from leukaemia-initiating cells.Nature. 2006; 441: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). This makes it possible to deplete leukemia-initiating cells while rescuing normal HSC function via rapamycin in mice that are deficient for Pten. A sophisticated understanding of PI3-kinase pathway signaling can therefore lead to therapies that eliminate cancer-initiating cells with limited toxicity to normal stem cells. One mechanism by which Pten deletion and PI3-kinase pathway activation could deplete stem cells involves a tumor suppressor response. Sustained oncogenic signals can induce tumor suppressors that cause cellular senescence (Lin et al., 1998Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Premature senescence involving p53 and p16 is activated in response to constitutive MEK/MAPK mitogenic signaling.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, Serrano et al., 1997Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Oncogenic ras provokes premature cell senescence associated with accumulation of p53 and p16INK4a.Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3708) Google Scholar). Conditional inactivation of Pten in prostate leads to the induction of p53-mediated senescence, impeding the development of prostate cancer (Chen et al., 2005Chen Z. Trotman L.C. Shaffer D. Lin H.K. Dotan Z.A. Niki M. Koutcher J.A. Scher H.I. Ludwig T. Gerald W. et al.Crucial role of p53-dependent cellular senescence in suppression of Pten-deficient tumorigenesis.Nature. 2005; 436: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). These studies raise the question of whether a similar tumor suppressor response occurs after Pten deletion in stem cells and whether this suppresses leukemogenesis or depletes HSCs. Another mechanism by which Pten deletion could deplete HSCs involves the inactivation of FoxO family transcription factors. When localized to the nucleus, FoxO transcription factors promote the expression of enzymes that eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, activated Akt phosphorylates FoxO proteins, leading to their retention in the cytoplasm (Biggs et al., 1999Biggs 3rd, W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C.

HSCs are particularly sensitive to the toxic effects of ROS (Ito et al., 2004Ito K. Hirao A. Arai F. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Hamaguchi I. Nomiyama K. Hosokawa K. Sakurada K.

Med. 2006; 12: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Deletion of FoxO1/3/4 or FoxO3a alone from adult HSCs leads to increased ROS levels and HSC depletion that can be at least partially rescued by the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) (Miyamoto et al., 2007Miyamoto K.

Chem. 2008; 283: 25692-25705Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The depletion of Tsc1-deficient HSCs is also partly rescued by NAC treatment (Chen et al., 2008Chen C. Liu Y. Liu R. Ikenoue T. Guan K.L. Liu Y. Zheng P. TSC-mTOR maintains quiescence and function of hematopoietic stem cells by repressing mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive oxygen species.J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 2397-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). On the other hand, constitutively active Akt did not increase ROS levels in HSCs and the depletion of these HSCs could not be rescued by NAC treatment (Kharas et al., 2010Kharas M.G. Okabe R. Ganis J.J. Gozo M. Khandan T. Paktinat M. Gilliland D.G. Gritsman K. Constitutively active AKT depletes hematopoietic stem cells and induces leukemia in mice.Blood. 2010; 115: 1406-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These results raise the question of whether Pten deficiency and FoxO deficiency deplete HSCs by similar or different mechanisms. We found that Pten deficiency and FoxO1/3/4 deficiency lead to HSC depletion by different mechanisms. We were unable to detect FoxO3a inactivation or a significant increase in ROS levels in HSCs after Pten deletion. We were not able to rescue the depletion of Pten-deficient HSCs by treating with NAC. Instead, Pten deletion induced the expression of p16Ink4a and p53 in HSCs and of p19Arf and p53 in other hematopoietic cells. Analysis of compound mutant mice revealed that deficiency for p19Arf, for p16Ink4a/p19Arf, or for p53 (but not p16Ink4a) accelerated leukemogenesis after Pten deletion. Moreover, deficiency for p16Ink4a, for p16Ink4a/p19Arf, or for p53 (but not p19Arf) autonomously prolonged the reconstituting capacity of HSCs after Pten deletion. Our results demonstrate that there are multiple mechanisms by which increased PI3-kinase pathway signaling can deplete HSCs, including an mTOR-mediated tumor suppressor response that occurs in HSCs after Pten deletion and that is attenuated by secondary mutations in leukemogenic clones. We conditionally deleted Pten from HSCs and other hematopoietic cells in young adult Ptenfl/fl;Mx-1-Cre+ mice and Pten+/fl;Mx-1-Cre+ littermate controls by administering seven doses of polyinosine-polycytidine (pIpC) over 14 days (Yilmaz et al., 2006Yilmaz O.H.

Pten-deleted mice and littermate controls were then treated for a week with daily injections of rapamycin or vehicle. Rapamycin treatment and Pten deletion both increased Akt activation in bone marrow cells and in HSCs based on western blots performed in c-kit+Flk-2−Lin−Sca-1+CD48− cells, a population highly enriched for HSCs (Figures 1A and 1B ; Christensen and Weissman, 2001Christensen J.L. Weissman I.L. Flk-2 is a marker in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation: a simple method to isolate long-term stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The increase in Akt phosphorylation after rapamycin treatment is consistent with the attenuation of a negative feedback loop from S6 kinase to IRS-1 as a result of reduced mTORC1 activation (Harrington et al., 2004Harrington L.S. Findlay G.M. Gray A. Tolkacheva T. Wigfield S. Rebholz H. Barnett J. Leslie N.R. Cheng S. Shepherd P.R. et al.The TSC1-2 tumor suppressor controls insulin-PI3K signaling via regulation of IRS proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Rapamycin does not, therefore, rescue the reconstituting activity of Pten-deficient HSCs by normalizing Akt activation. Pten deletion did not appear to deplete HSCs by negatively regulating FoxO expression. By western blot neither Pten deletion nor rapamycin treatment appeared to significantly affect total FoxO3a levels in c-kit+Flk-2−Lin−Sca-1+CD48− HSCs (Figure 1B), or phospho-FoxO3a levels, total FoxO1 levels, or phospho-H2AX levels in c-kit+Lin−Sca-1+ cells (Figure S2). In control experiments, when CD150+CD48−CD41−Lin−c-kit+Sca-1+ HSCs (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H. Iwashita T. Terhorst C. Morrison S.J. SLAM family receptors distinguish hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and reveal endothelial niches for stem cells.Cell. 2005; 121: 1109-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar) were sorted from control and Pten-deleted mice and stimulated with SCF and TPO in culture for 24 hr, they showed an overall decrease in FoxO3a staining as well as decreased nuclear staining and increased cytoplasmic staining (Figure S3). In contrast, when HSCs were stained immediately after isolation from mice, we detected no change in FoxO3a expression or subcellular localization after Pten deletion (Figures 1F–1H): FoxO3a continued to localize to the nucleus. mTORC1 activity was clearly elevated after Pten deletion based on increased phospho-S6 levels in freshly isolated bone marrow cells and HSCs (Figures 1A, 1B, 1D, 1E, and 1H). This increase in phospho-S6 levels was attenuated by rapamycin treatment (Figures 1A and 1B). These changes were further confirmed by increased phospho-4EBP1 levels in bone marrow cells after Pten deletion (Figure 1A). This increase in phospho-4EBP1 levels was also attenuated by rapamycin treatment (Figure 1A). Thus, Pten deletion increased mTORC1 and S6 kinase activation in a manner that was reversed by rapamycin, suggesting that the changes that lead to HSC depletion after Pten deletion are mediated by this branch of the PI3-kinase pathway. We assessed the intracellular levels of ROS in CD150+CD48−CD41−Lin−c-kit+Sca-1+ HSCs, CD150−CD48−CD41−Lin−c-kit+Sca-1+ transiently reconstituting multipotent progenitors (MPPs) (Kiel et al., 2008Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H. Morrison S.J. CD150- cells are transiently reconstituting multipotent progenitors with little or no stem cell activity.Blood. 2008; 111: 4413-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), bone marrow cells, and thymocytes from Pten-deleted mice and littermate controls 1 week after finishing pIpC treatment. After Pten deletion, we detected a significant increase in ROS levels in thymocytes (Figures 2C and 2E ; 2.8-fold, p < 0.05) but not in bone marrow cells, HSCs, or MPPs (Figures 2B and 2E). Three weeks after finishing pIpC treatment, we also did not detect an increase in ROS levels within unfractionated bone marrow cells, HSCs, or MPPs (Figures 2D and 2F). Only mice showing no signs of neoplasms were used in these experiments. The increase in ROS levels in the thymus after Pten deletion was attenuated by daily subcutaneous injection of the antioxidant NAC, but NAC did not affect ROS levels in bone marrow cells, HSCs, or MPPs (Figure 2F). It is unclear why Pten deletion increased ROS levels in thymocytes but not in HSCs or WBM cells, but ROS regulation is known to differ among hematopoietic cells (Ito et al., 2004Ito K. Hirao A.

We were also unable to detect significant effects of Pten deletion on the expression of FoxO target genes (Tothova et al., 2007Tothova Z. Kollipara R. Huntly B.J. Lee B.H. Castrillon D.H. Cullen D.E.

Consistent with the normal ROS levels in HSCs and most other hematopoietic cells, daily treatment with NAC for 3 weeks after pIpC treatment did not rescue the changes in spleen, thymus, or bone marrow cellularity after Pten deletion (Figures S4A and S4B). NAC treatment also did not rescue the depletion of bone marrow HSCs (Figures 2G and 2J). MPP frequency and number in the bone marrow and spleen were not significantly affected by Pten deletion or NAC treatment (Figures 2H, 2I, 2K, and 2L). The frequency and absolute number of HSCs and MPPs increased significantly in the spleen 3 weeks after pIpC treatment (Figures 2I and 2L), consistent with the extramedullary hematopoiesis that arises after Pten deletion (Yilmaz et al., 2006Yilmaz O.H. Valdez R. Theisen B.K. Guo W. Ferguson D.O. Wu H. Morrison S.J. Pten dependence distinguishes haematopoietic stem cells from leukaemia-initiating cells.Nature. 2006; 441: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). NAC attenuated the increase in splenic HSCs, though HSC frequency and number still increased significantly in the spleen (Figures 2I and 2L). NAC also had little effect on other changes in hematopoiesis after Pten deletion (Figures S5A–S5C). The inability of NAC to rescue hematopoietic defects after Pten deletion contrasts with the ability of rapamycin to do so (Yilmaz et al., 2006Yilmaz O.H. Valdez R. Theisen B.K. Guo W. Ferguson D.O. Wu H. Morrison S.J. Pten dependence distinguishes haematopoietic stem cells from leukaemia-initiating cells.Nature. 2006; 441: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). To test whether NAC rescues the function of Pten-deleted HSCs, we treated Ptenfl/fl;Mx-1-Cre+ and Pten+/fl;Mx-1-Cre+ mice with seven doses of pIpC over 14 days, then transplanted 10 donor CD150+CD48−CD41−Lin−c-kit+Sca-1+ HSCs along with a radioprotective dose of recipient bone marrow cells into irradiated recipients. Half of the recipients received daily subcutaneous injections of NAC, while the other half received daily saline injections, starting on the day after transplantation. In three independent experiments, all recipients of control HSCs, whether treated with NAC or vehicle, were long-term multilineage reconstituted by donor cells (Figures 3A–3E ). All of the recipients of Pten-deleted HSCs showed transient multilineage reconstitution, irrespective of whether they were treated with NAC (Figures 3A–3E). The inability of NAC to rescue Pten-deficient HSC frequency or function suggests that oxidative stress is unlikely to be the primary determinant of HSC depletion after Pten deletion. To assess whether NAC treatment reduces leukemogenesis after Pten deletion, we transplanted 1 × 106 bone marrow cells from untreated Ptenfl/fl;Mx-1-Cre+ mice or Pten+/fl;Mx-1-Cre+ controls along with 500,000 recipient bone marrow cells into irradiated recipients. Six weeks later, we treated the recipients with seven doses of pIpC over 14 days followed by daily NAC or saline injection. In two independent experiments, recipients of control cells all survived for 120 days and showed no signs of leukemogenesis (n = 20, Figure 3F). In contrast, all 20 recipients of Pten-deleted bone marrow died with myeloproliferative disease (MPD) and/or T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) 33 to 112 days after pIpC treatment, irrespective of whether they were treated with NAC (Figure 3F; Figures S5D–S5I). NAC treatment did not significantly affect the lifespan of mice after Pten deletion (Figure 3F) in contrast to rapamycin, which prevents leukemogenesis and extends the lifespan of Pten-deleted mice (Yilmaz et al., 2006Yilmaz O.H. Valdez R. Theisen B.K. Guo W. Ferguson D.O. Wu H. Morrison S.J. Pten dependence distinguishes haematopoietic stem cells from leukaemia-initiating cells.Nature. 2006; 441: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). We tested whether Pten deletion induced a tumor suppressor response by assessing the expression of p16Ink4a, p19Arf, p53, and p21Cip1 in splenocytes. We did not detect p16Ink4a protein expression in splenocytes with or without Pten deletion (Figure 4A ). We did detect very low levels of p16Ink4a transcript in splenocytes, but transcript levels were not significantly affected by Pten deletion or rapamycin treatment (Figure S6A). In contrast, we observed clear increases in p19Arf, p53, and p21Cip1 protein after Pten deletion (Figure 4A). These increases were attenuated or eliminated by rapamycin, suggesting that the expression of these tumor suppressors was elevated as a consequence of mTOR activation (Figure 4A). We confirmed significantly increased expression of p19Arf (Figure 4B) and p21Cip1 (Figure S6B) by qPCR in Pten-deficient splenocytes and that these increases were eliminated by rapamycin treatment. We observed no effect of Pten deletion or rapamycin treatment on p53 transcript levels (Figure S6C), consistent with the observation that p53 expression is mainly regulated posttranscriptionally (Olsson et al., 2007Olsson A. Manzl C. Strasser A. Villunger A. How important are post-translational modifications in p53 for selectivity in target-gene transcription and tumour suppression?.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1561-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this tumor suppressor response inhibited leukemogenesis but promoted the depletion of HSCs after Pten deletion and that rapamycin rescued HSC depletion by attenuating the tumor suppressor response in HSCs. Because p16Ink4a and p19Arf are expressed at extraordinarily low levels in primary somatic cells and only limited amounts of protein are available from rare HSCs, we sorted 2 × 106 Lin−c-kit+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, immunoprecipitated p16Ink4a, p19Arf, and p53, then performed western blots to assess the levels of p16Ink4a, p19Arf, and p53. We observed p16Ink4a and p53 expression in the Pten-deficient Lin−c-kit+ cells but not in wild-type cells or cells treated with rapamycin, but we did not detect p19Arf expression in wild-type or Pten-deficient Lin−c-kit+ cells (Figure 4C). p16Ink4a transcript levels also increased in CD150+CD48−CD41−Lin−c-kit+Sca-1+ HSCs after Pten deletion and this increase was attenuated by rapamycin treatment (Figure 4D). We were unable to detect a clear increase in p19Arf expression after Pten deletion (Figure 4D). We also stained CD150+CD48−CD41−Lin−c-kit+Sca-1+ HSCs with p53 antibody on sl"
https://openalex.org/W1996593977,"In contrast to its extensively studied intracellular roles, the molecular mechanisms by which extracellular Ca(2+) regulates the basal excitability of neurons are unclear. One mechanism is believed to be through Ca(2+)'s interaction with the negative charges on the cell membrane (the charge screening effect). Here we show that, in cultured hippocampal neurons, lowering [Ca(2+)](e) activates a NALCN channel-dependent Na(+)-leak current (I(L-Na)). The coupling between [Ca(2+)](e) and NALCN requires a Ca(2+)-sensing G protein-coupled receptor, an activation of G-proteins, an UNC80 protein that bridges NALCN to a large novel protein UNC79 in the same complex, and the last amino acid of NALCN's intracellular tail. In neurons from nalcn and unc79 knockout mice, I(L-Na) is insensitive to changes in [Ca(2+)](e), and reducing [Ca(2+)](e) fails to elicit the excitatory effects seen in the wild-type. Therefore, extracellular Ca(2+) influences neuronal excitability through the UNC79-UNC80-NALCN complex in a G protein-dependent fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2099161813,"Steroid hormones are known systemic regulators of multiple normal and cancerous tissues; however, whether or how they impact the fate and function of adult stem cells is unclear. In the Drosophila ovary, insulin signals modulate the proliferation and self-renewal of germline stem cells (GSCs), yet despite evidence that additional systemic factors control GSC activity, these have remained largely unknown. Here, we report that ecdysone, a steroid hormone structurally related to mammalian sex steroids, directly regulates adult GSC proliferation and self-renewal independently of insulin signaling. Ecdysone controls GSCs through a functional interaction with the chromatin remodeling factors ISWI, an intrinsic epigenetic factor required for GSC fate and activity, and Nurf301, the largest subunit of the ISWI-containing NURF chromatin remodeling complex. Our findings support a link between systemic steroid hormones and the intrinsic chromatin remodeling machinery as a potential mechanism to promote broad transcriptional programs required for adult stem cell self-renewal."
https://openalex.org/W2034126438,"The first intron of FTO contains common single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with body weight and adiposity in humans. In an effort to identify the molecular basis for this association, we discovered that FTO and RPGRIP1L (a ciliary gene located in close proximity to the transcriptional start site of FTO) are regulated by isoforms P200 and P110 of the transcription factor, CUX1. This regulation occurs via a single AATAAATA regulatory site (conserved in the mouse) within the FTO intronic region associated with adiposity in humans. Single nucleotide polymorphism rs8050136 (located in this regulatory site) affects binding affinities of P200 and P110. Promoter-probe analysis revealed that binding of P200 to this site represses FTO, whereas binding of P110 increases transcriptional activity from the FTO as well as RPGRIP1L minimal promoters. Reduced expression of Fto or Rpgrip1l affects leptin receptor isoform b trafficking and leptin signaling in N41 mouse hypothalamic or N2a neuroblastoma cells in vitro. Leptin receptor clusters in the vicinity of the cilium of arcuate hypothalamic neurons in C57BL/6J mice treated with leptin, but not in fasted mice, suggesting a potentially important role of the cilium in leptin signaling that is, in part, regulated by FTO and RPGRIP1L. Decreased Fto/Rpgrip1l expression in the arcuate hypothalamus coincides with decreased nuclear enzymatic activity of a protease (cathepsin L) that has been shown to cleave full-length CUX1 (P200) to P110.

Clustering of the receptor coincides with increased leptin signaling as reflected in protein levels of phosphorylated Stat3 (p-Stat3). Association of the FTO locus with adiposity in humans may reflect functional consequences of A/C alleles at rs8050136. The obesity-risk (A) allele shows reduced affinity for the FTO and RPGRIP1L transcriptional activator P110, leading to the following: 1) decreased FTO and RPGRIP1L mRNA levels; 2) reduced LEPR trafficking to the cilium; and, as a consequence, 3) a diminished cellular response to leptin.

Watts A.J. Roper V.C. Croyle M.J. van Groen T. Wyss J.M. Nagy T.R. Kesterson R.A. Yoder B.K. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1586-1594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Thus, RPGRIP1L, which is expressed in the hypothalamus (20Stratigopoulos G. Padilla S.L. LeDuc C.A. Watson E. Hattersley A.T. McCarthy M.I. Zeltser L.M. Chung W.K. Leibel R.L. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 294: R1185-R1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), could also account for some or all of the strong association signal for obesity coming from Chr16 (52.3–52.4 Mb), the interval in which FTO and RPGRIP1L are located. Our previous studies suggest that FTO and/or RPGRIP1L act in an anorexigenic pathway in the hypothalamus, as expression of these genes decreases upon fasting or cooling of mice (20Stratigopoulos G. Padilla S.L. LeDuc C.A. Watson E. Hattersley A.T. McCarthy M.I. Zeltser L.M. Chung W.K. Leibel R.L. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 294: R1185-R1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In this study, we confirm that FTO and RPGRIP1L mRNA levels decline specifically in the ventromedial and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei of fasted mice and that expression levels of these transcripts are restored by systemic leptin administration. In vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that FTO and RPGRIP1L are involved in leptin receptor trafficking as well as leptin signaling, processes that may account for their apparent influences on adiposity. Earlier, we found that the transcription factor cut-like homeobox 1 (CUX1), also known as “CUTL1,” binds DNA at SNP rs8050136 within the region of linkage disequilibrium in the first intron of FTO associated with adiposity phenotypes, and it regulates the expression of both FTO and RPGRIP1L in vitro (Fig. 1) (20Stratigopoulos G. Padilla S.L. LeDuc C.A. Watson E. Hattersley A.T. McCarthy M.I. Zeltser L.M. Chung W.K. Leibel R.L. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 294: R1185-R1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Originally characterized as the CCAAT-displacement transcriptional repressor, CUX1 is also processed to isoforms that act as transcriptional activators. Both of these regulatory functions have been implicated in cell cycle progression and cell motility (21Sansregret L. Nepveu A. Gene. 2008; 412: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We examined the role of CUX1 as a transcriptional regulator of FTO/RPGRIP1L by performing electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and promoter-analysis experiments. Based upon these studies, we propose that isoforms of CUX1 (P200 and P110) display allelic preferential binding at rs8050136 and act as a transcriptional repressor of FTO (P200) or transcriptional activator of FTO and RPGRIP1L (P110). In addition, in vivo and in vitro data presented here suggest that LEPR trafficking to the cilium is important for leptin signaling and that FTO and/or RPGRIP1L modulate LEPR trafficking and thereby leptin signaling. Based upon these data, we propose a molecular mechanism of FTO and RPGRIP1L regulation by CUX1 that mediates control of food intake in both rodents and humans and partly or entirely accounts for the genetic association signal in intron 1 of FTO with adiposity. Lepob (B6.V-Lepob/J) and wild-type (+/+; C57BL/6J) male mice were ordered from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were fed breeder chow (9% kcal from fat; Picolab 5058; Purina Mills) and sacrificed at 4–5 weeks of age. Fasted mice were food-deprived for 42 h, starting at 6 p.m. At 12-h intervals until sacrifice, they received intraperitoneal injections of a saline solution of leptin (purchased from A. F. Parlow, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health), at 1 μg/g of total body weight, or they were co-injected with leptin and with cathepsin L inhibitor I in corn oil (Calbiochem) at 15 μg/g of total body weight. Control mice were injected with saline and/or corn oil. For the thermal challenge experiments, mice were placed singly without bedding in a 4 °C cold room for 4 h. Room temperature was constant at 23 °C on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (lights were turned off at 7 p.m.), and mice had ad libitum access to food and water. All protocols were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Murine neuroblastoma N2a (ATCC ccl-131) and embryonic mouse hypothalamic N41 (mHypoE-N41; Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd., Burlington, NC) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. 2 days after transfection with p200- or p110-overexpressing vectors, N41 or N2a embryo hypothalamic cells were treated with 5 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen) prior to total RNA extraction. For the phosphorylated Stat3 assay or immunofluorescence studies, subconfluent N41 or N2a cells were made quiescent 36 h after transfection, by incubation in DMEM with 0.5% BSA overnight. Cells were then treated with leptin for 6 h prior to protein extraction. The hypothalami of ∼40, 3–4 week-old C57BL/6J male and female mice were dissected as described elsewhere (22Kamberi I.A. Kobayashi Y. J. Neurochem. 1970; 17: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The arcuate nucleus was micropunched and added directly to the papain solution provided by the papain dissociation system (Worthington). Cells were dissociated according to the manufacturer's instructions, plated in DMEM/F-12 + GlutaMAXTM-I (supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum; Invitrogen) on poly-d-lysine/laminin 2-well culture slides (BD Biosciences) for 7 days. Cells were treated with leptin (1 μg/ml) every 24 h for 2 days and/or cathepsin L inhibitor I (10 μm). Four-week-old C57BL/6J male mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissues were excised, dehydrated in 30% sucrose, frozen, and placed on slides as 10-μm medial coronal hypothalamic sections. Cultured cell slides were fixed with ice-cold methanol/acetone (1:1). Primary antibodies against LEPR (2 μg/ml for immunohistochemistry, 0.5 μg/ml for immunofluorescence; Mouse; catalog no. AF497, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), adenylyl cyclase III (AcIII; 1:500; mouse; catalog no. sc-588, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), pericentrin (1:500; rabbit; catalog no. ab4448, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and GFP (1:500; mouse; catalog no. 11814460001, Roche Applied Science) were used in conjunction with Alexa Fluor® 488, 555, and 647 secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). ProLong® Gold antifade reagent with either DAPI (Invitrogen) or DRAQ5 (Axxora, San Diego) was used for mounting and nuclear staining. All mice were sacrificed between 2 and 4 p.m. Within 2 min of decapitation, brains were submerged in O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and frozen in an isopentane/dry ice bath. Blocks were brought to −6 °C and sectioned into 0.3-mm-thick slices in a Microm HM 525 cryotome (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). ARH, VMH, PVN, and DMH were isolated by multiple micro-punches (23Palkovits M. Brain Res. 1973; 59: 449-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar) using the coordinates −0.7 to −2.4 (24.Slotnick, B. M., Leonard, C. M., (eds) (1975) A Stereotaxic Atlas of the Albino Mouse Forebrain, United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Public Health Service, Alcohol, Drug Abuse, Rockville, MD.Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted and DNase-treated using the RNAqueous® micro kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear protein extracts were isolated in the presence of Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Pierce) using the NE-PER® nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total protein levels were measured using the Bradford assay (Pierce). N41 or N2a cells were plated to 90% confluency and transfected with 20 ng of plasmid DNA (96-well tissue culture dish; BD Biosciences) or 2 μg of plasmid DNA (T25 tissue culture dish; BD Biosciences) using Lipofectamine 2000TM (Invitrogen), and cells were subsequently grown for 48 h. All cultured cells were washed with PBS, scraped off the surface of the Petri dish, and collected by centrifugation for 5 min at ∼500 × g. Total RNA extraction, DNase treatment, isolation of nuclear protein extracts, and total protein level measurement were performed as above. cDNA synthesis from 1.0 μg of total RNA was performed at 50 °C for 50 min utilizing the transcriptor first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science) with oligo(dT)20 primers. Quantitative PCR was performed as described elsewhere (20Stratigopoulos G. Padilla S.L. LeDuc C.A. Watson E. Hattersley A.T. McCarthy M.I. Zeltser L.M. Chung W.K. Leibel R.L. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 294: R1185-R1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The geometric mean of Gapdh and Actb expression levels was used as loading controls. Cux1-specific primers are described elsewhere (supplemental Table 1). Anti-CDP (p200 and p110) (1:500; mouse; catalog no. sc-6327X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for Western blotting and supershifting. Phospho-Stat3 (Tyr-705) antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (1:1000; catalog no. 9131, Danvers, MA) and utilized for Western blotting. β-Tubulin (1:2000; catalog no. 05-661; Millipore, Bedford, MA) and nucleolin (0.5 μg/ml; catalog no. ab50279; Abcam) were used as internal controls. The full-length human CUX1 (P200) cDNA overexpression construct was purchased from Open Biosystems (MHS1010-97228334; Huntsville, AL). The P110 cDNA was obtained by digesting the above construct with HindIII/NotI. The fragment was N-filled and cloned into pCMV-Sport6 (Open Biosystems) that had previously been digested with SalI/NotI, N-filled as above, and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biosystems, Ipswich, MA). The full-length mouse Cux1 (p200) cDNA was cloned by OriGene in pCMV6 (Rockville, MD). Mouse p110 was excised with ScaI/NotI, N-filled, and cloned in pENTRTM 4 (Invitrogen) at the N-filled EcoRI site. p110 was subsequently cloned downstream of the CMV promoter in the pLenti 6.3/V5-DEST Gateway® vector (Invitrogen) utilizing the Gateway® LR ClonaseTM II enzyme mix (Invitrogen). The mouse leptin receptor isoform b (Lepr-b) enhanced GFP translational fusion was amplified by PCR using as template a plasmid kindly provided by C. Bjorbaek (Harvard Medical School, Boston). The consensus ribosomal binding sequence (CACC) was introduced via PCR (for primer sequence see supplemental Table 1) upstream of the Lepr-b cDNA to improve expression efficiency and facilitate directional subcloning into pENTRTM/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) as a blunt-ended DNA fragment. The directionally cloned blunt-PCR product was then used as template for entry downstream of the CMV promoter into pLenti6.3/V5-DEST (Invitrogen). The FTO and RPGRIP1L minimal promoters (Fig. 1) were amplified utilizing genomic DNA from skin-derived human primary fibroblasts homozygous for the A or C allele of rs8050136, using primers described elsewhere (supplemental Table 1). The resulting fragments were cloned into pGL3 (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), at the respective restriction sites. The site containing rs8050136 was obtained by PCR from human DNA homozygous for A or C (supplemental Table 1) and cloned upstream of or the absence of the FTO or RPGRIP1L minimal promoters. pRL (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was also used as a transfection efficiency control. Assays were performed with the Dual-Luciferase reporter system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). All reagents were prepared as described by the manufacturer. N2a cells were transfected in a 96-well Petri dish with 20 ng of each plasmid (2 ng of Enh(C):FTO1p, Enh(C):FTO2p, and Enh(C):RPGRIP1Lp were used) at 50% confluency using the Lipofectamine 2000TM reagent 48 h before lysis in passive lysis buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Measurement of luciferase activity was conducted in a BD Monolight 3096 microplate luminometer (BD Biosciences). 100 μl of the firefly luciferase reagent (LARII) was added to the test sample, followed by addition of 100 μl of the Renilla luciferase reagent and firefly quenching (Stop & Glo). A 10-s equilibration time was allowed, and measurement of luminescence with a 10-s integration time was performed. The data are represented as the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activity (Fluc/Rluc). N2a cells at 75% confluency in a T25 flask were transfected with 2 μg of overexpression construct using Lipofectamine 2000TM reagent. Cells were collected, and nuclear protein extracts were isolated and quantified as described earlier. Oligonucleotides with the human CUX1-binding sequence containing the A, C, or mutated alleles as well as the mouse Cux1-binding sequence containing the native mouse (A) or human (C) alleles were synthesized by Invitrogen (supplemental Table 1). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were obtained by priming at 95 °C for 5 min in TE buffer containing 50 nm NaCl and cooled gradually for 2 h. Each lane of a 4–20% TBE gel (Invitrogen) was loaded with 20 ng of double-stranded oligonucleotide and/or 300 ng of total protein. Supershifting was achieved by loading 3 μg of antibody. DNA-protein binding and DNA staining with SYBR Green were performed using the nonradioactive EMSA kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Visualization of the DNA was performed in a Kodak Gel Logic 212 Imaging System using a SYBR Green filter. Band intensities were measured using ImageJ 1.36B (National Institutes of Health). Cathepsin L activity was measured in 50 μg of total nuclear extracts of the arcuate nucleus using the cathepsin L activity assay kit (Abcam) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence intensity was measured in a white flat-bottom Costar 96-well plate (catalog no. 3693; Corning, Lowell, MA) using an AnalystTM AD 96-384 plate reader (LJL Biosystems/Molecular Devices; Sunnyvale, CA) with a 360-nm excitation filter and 520-nm emission filter. Interval between flashes and delay after flash were set at 1000 and 10 ms, respectively. Lamp was set at flash. Background readings were subtracted from sample values. siRNA transfection has been described elsewhere (20Stratigopoulos G. Padilla S.L. LeDuc C.A. Watson E. Hattersley A.T. McCarthy M.I. Zeltser L.M. Chung W.K. Leibel R.L. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 294: R1185-R1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). siRNA was co-transfected with 0.5 μg/ml of the Lepr-b-overexpressing vector. For Fto or Rpgrip1l, a combination of three siRNA or scrambled species was used (supplemental Table 1). Data are expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test (StatView 5.0, SAS Institute Inc.). Levels of statistical significance were set at two-tailed pα <0.05. In all figures, error bars are S.D. We have previously reported that in whole hypothalami of mice exposed to 4 °C or fasted, there is a decrease of Fto and Rpgrip1l expression in Lepob versus +/+ mice (20Stratigopoulos G. Padilla S.L. LeDuc C.A. Watson E. Hattersley A.T. McCarthy M.I. Zeltser L.M. Chung W.K. Leibel R.L. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 294: R1185-R1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In this study, we used RT-PCR to examine Fto and Rpgrip1l transcript levels in isolated hypothalamic PVN, DMH, VMH, and ARH nuclei of lean and Lepob mice. Fto expression was ∼7-fold higher than Rpgrip1l expression in all nuclei (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2A). In the ARH, Fto and Rpgrip1l expression levels were, respectively, ∼30% (p < 0.001) and ∼25% (p < 0.001) higher than in any other nuclei tested (p < 0.001). In Lepob mice versus +/+ controls, Fto and Rpgrip1l expression was reduced in the VMH (∼55 and ∼25%, respectively; p < 0.001) and ARH (∼30 and ∼55%, respectively; p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). In contrast, Fto and Rpgrip1l transcript levels in the PVN and DMH were indistinguishable between +/+ lean and Lepob mice (p > 0.1), suggesting that Fto and Rpgrip1l may play specific roles regarding energy homeostasis in neurons of the VMH and ARH. In the ARH, food restriction and cold exposure increase expression of the orexigens NPY/AGRP and suppress the anorexigen pro-opiomelanocortin (25Overton J.M. Williams T.D. Physiol. Behav. 2004; 81: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Fto and Rpgrip1l expression were measured in hypothalamic nuclei of +/+ fasted mice and mice exposed to 4 °C for 4 h (summarized in Table in Fig. 2B). Fto and Rpgrip1l expression levels were decreased in the VMH (∼25 and ∼30% respectively; p < 0.001) and ARH (∼25 and ∼40%, respectively; p < 0.001) of fasted +/+ mice compared with fed +/+ mice, and expression was restored in fasted mice by peripheral administration of leptin. Moreover, Fto and Rpgrip1l expression levels in the VMH and ARH of Lepob mice were restored by peripheral administration of leptin. These results suggest that FTO and RPGRIP1L may act as tonic anorexigens, declining in response to fasting in neurons of the VMH and ARH that mediate leptin signals from the peripheral circulation. In mice exposed to 4 °C, Fto expression decreased in the PVN (∼60%; p < 0.001), DMH (∼60%; p < 0.001), VMH (∼60%; p < 0.001), and ARH (∼75%; p < 0.001) nuclei, whereas decreased Rpgrip1l expression was restricted to the VMH (∼20%; p < 0.001) and ARH (∼40%; p < 0.001) in these animals. The effect of ambient cooling on Fto expression in the PVN may implicate PVN neurons that receive inputs from the ARH and regulate the pituitary-thyroid axis in response to thermal challenge (26Herwig A. Ross A.W. Nilaweera K.N. Morgan P.J. Barrett P. Obes. Facts. 2008; 1: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have previously identified and confirmed by chromatin immunoprecip"
https://openalex.org/W1999706790,"Mdm2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for degradation. p53(515C) (encoding p53R172P) is a hypomorphic allele of p53 that rescues the embryonic lethality of Mdm2(-/-) mice. Mdm2(-/-) p53(515C/515C) mice, however, die by postnatal day 13 resulting from hematopoietic failure. Hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors of Mdm2(-/-) p53(515C/515C) mice were normal in fetal livers but were depleted in postnatal bone marrows. After birth, these mice had elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) thus activating p53R172P. In the absence of Mdm2, stable p53R172P induced ROS and cell cycle arrest, senescence, and cell death in the hematopoietic compartment. This phenotype was partially rescued with antioxidant treatment and upon culturing of hematopoietic cells in methycellulose at 3% oxygen. p16 was also stabilized because of ROS, and its loss increased cell cycling and partially rescued hematopoiesis and survival. Thus, Mdm2 is required to control ROS-induced p53 levels for sustainable hematopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2067903474,"The anabolic effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on bone formation are impaired by concurrent use of antiresorptive drugs. We found that the release of active transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 during osteoclastic bone resorption is inhibited by alendronate. We showed that mouse Sca-1-positive (Sca-1(+)) bone marrow stromal cells are a skeletal stem cell subset, which are recruited to bone remodeling sites by active TGF-β1 in response to bone resorption. Alendronate inhibits the release of active TGF-β1 and the recruitment of Sca-1(+) skeletal stem cells for the bone formation. The observation was validated in a Tgfb1(-/-) mouse model, in which the anabolic effects of PTH on bone formation are diminished. The PTH-stimulated recruitment of injected mouse Sca-1(+) cells to the resorptive sites was inhibited by alendronate. Thus, inhibition of active TGF-β1 release by alendronate reduces the recruitment of Sca-1(+) skeletal stem cells and impairs the anabolic action of PTH in bone."

https://openalex.org/W2119012949,"Memory and attention deficits are common after prefrontal cortex (PFC) damage, yet people generally recover some function over time. Recovery is thought to be dependent upon undamaged brain regions, but the temporal dynamics underlying cognitive recovery are poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that the intact PFC compensates for damage in the lesioned PFC on a trial-by-trial basis dependent on cognitive load. The extent of this rapid functional compensation is indexed by transient increases in electrophysiological measures of attention and memory in the intact PFC, detectable within a second after stimulus presentation and only when the lesioned hemisphere is challenged. These observations provide evidence supporting a dynamic and flexible model of compensatory neural plasticity."

Recently, we found that T- and R-type Ca2+ channels are concentrated in the AIS, where they contribute to local subthreshold membrane depolarization and thereby influence action potential initiation. While periods of high-frequency activity can alter availability of AIS voltage-gated channels, mechanisms for long-term modulation of AIS channel function remain unknown. Here, we examined the regulatory pathways that control AIS Ca2+ channel activity in brainstem interneurons. T-type Ca2+ channels were downregulated by dopamine receptor activation acting via protein kinase C, which in turn reduced neuronal output.

T-type Ca2+ channels, which are thought to contribute to the generation of AP bursts, inactivate as a neuron depolarizes, altering neuronal firing patterns (Kim and Trussell, 2007Kim Y. Trussell L.O.

These changes occur on the time scale of seconds; however, it remains unknown what mechanisms exist for long-term control of AIS excitability through second-messenger-dependent modification of constituent channels. Here, we examined regulatory mechanisms that control the excitability of dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) cartwheel interneurons. Cartwheel cells are ideal for studying mechanisms of AP initiation because they intrinsically fire APs in a variety of ways, including bursts and single spikes, and the underlying ion channels that determine AP output in both the somatodendritic compartment and the AIS are relatively well understood (Bender and Trussell, 2009Bender K.J. Trussell L.O. Axon initial segment Ca2+ channels influence action potential generation and timing.Neuron. 2009; 61: 259-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, Kim and Trussell, 2007Kim Y. Trussell L.O. Ion channels generating complex spikes in cartwheel cells of the dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 1705-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In these cells, we found that dopamine altered neuronal output by modification of T-type Ca2+ channels involved in AP initiation. Dopamine receptor activation, either by exogenous or endogenous agonists, activated protein kinase C (PKC), leading to inhibition of AIS T-type channels. This pathway was specific for AIS T-type channels; dopamine receptor activation had no effect on intrinsic cell properties, somatodendritic T-type Ca2+ channels, AIS Na+ influx, or whole-cell K+ and persistent Na+ currents. Similar to direct antagonist block of AIS Ca2+ channels (Bender and Trussell, 2009Bender K.J. Trussell L.O. Axon initial segment Ca2+ channels influence action potential generation and timing.Neuron. 2009; 61: 259-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), activation of this pathway ultimately reduced the AP output of these auditory interneurons. Thus, these data are the first direct evidence of ion channel modulation in the AIS and suggest that dopaminergic signaling mediates fine-scale adjustments of neuronal output by controlling the activity of AIS Ca2+ channels. Whole-cell recordings were made from DCN cartwheel cells in acute brain slices prepared from 16- to 24-day-old mice. Cells were filled via patch pipettes with the red volume marker Alexa 594 and the green Ca2+-sensitive fluorophore Fluo-5F. Morphology and Ca2+ activity were visualized with a two-photon microscope. To examine AIS Ca2+ channel modulation, we evoked AP trains with somatic current injection and imaged concomitant Ca2+ transients 14–18 μm from the axon hillock (Figure 1A ). Using these techniques, we showed previously that Ca2+ transients imaged at these locations were blocked by the T- and R-type Ca2+ channel antagonists mibefradil and SNX-482 (Bender and Trussell, 2009Bender K.J. Trussell L.O. Axon initial segment Ca2+ channels influence action potential generation and timing.Neuron. 2009; 61: 259-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). AIS Ca2+ transients were also reduced by 50 μM Ni2+, suggesting that the AIS contains the Ni2+-sensitive CaV3.2 T-channel subunit (Lee et al., 1999Lee J.H. Gomora J.C. Cribbs L.L. Perez-Reyes E. Nickel block of three cloned T-type calcium channels: low concentrations selectively block alpha1H.Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3034-3042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). These channels are common targets for modulation via dopaminergic pathways (Chemin et al., 2006Chemin J. Traboulsie A. Lory P.

Molecular physiology of low-voltage-activated t-type calcium channels.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 117-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar) and indeed we found that dopamine, applied at a concentration of 500 nM or 50 μM, decreased AIS Ca2+ transients by 27% ± 4% (n = 4) and 32% ± 4% (n = 8), respectively (Figures 1B and 1G). Dopamine can act through a variety of receptors, broadly grouped into dopamine receptor type 1 (D1R and D5R) and type 2 families (D2R, D3R, and D4R). Dopamine-mediated effects on AIS Ca2+ transients were blocked by the D2-family specific antagonist sulpiride (Figure 1G; 200 nM, normalized ΔG/R: 1.01 ± 0.02, n = 4, p < 0.0001) and mimicked by the D2-family agonist quinpirole (Figures 1C and 1G; 1 μM, normalized ΔG/R: 0.66 ± 0.03, n = 10), suggesting that AIS Ca2+ channels were regulated by D2, D3, or D4 receptors. In situ hybridization labeling for D2-family mRNA shows D3R mRNA in the DCN, but not D2R or D4R mRNA (Bouthenet et al., 1991Bouthenet M.L. Souil E. Martres M.P. Sokoloff P. Giros B. Schwartz J.C.

Consistent with these results, quinpirole did not reduce AIS Ca2+ transients in D3R knockout mice (Figures 1D and 1G; normalized ΔG/R: 0.96 ± 0.03, n = 6 cells, 3 animals, p < 0.001 versus wild-type). D3R heterozygotes displayed a wild-type phenotype (normalized ΔG/R: 0.59 ± 0.03, n = 5, p = 0.2 versus wild-type). Cartwheel cells express both T- and R-type Ca2+ channels in the AIS. These channels can be blocked by mibefradil, which acts on T- and R-type channels, and SNX-482, which acts on R-type channels. We observed previously that SNX-482-sensitive AIS Ca2+ transients persist in the presence of mibefradil, suggesting that mibefradil largely blocks T-type channels in the AIS (Bender and Trussell, 2009Bender K.J. Trussell L.O. Axon initial segment Ca2+ channels influence action potential generation and timing.Neuron. 2009; 61: 259-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether T- or R-type channels were modulated by dopamine, we isolated AIS Ca2+ influx through R-type channels by imaging in the presence of 3 μM mibefradil. Consistent with previous results, AIS Ca2+ transients were 50.2% smaller in mibefradil compared to Ca2+ transients imaged in other cells in control conditions (n = 8 in mibefradil, 28 control, p < 0.0001, unpaired t test). Quinpirole had a small effect on these Ca2+ transients (Figure 1G; normalized ΔG/R: 0.91 ± 0.04, p < 0.0001 versus quinpirole without mibefradil). This could be due to modulation of either R-type channels or a fraction of T-type channels that was not blocked by 3 μM mibefradil (McDonough and Bean, 1998McDonough S.I. Bean B.P. Mibefradil inhibition of T-type calcium channels in cerebellar purkinje neurons.Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1080-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Overall, these results suggest that dopamine primarily affected T-type channels. D3R signaling may decrease AIS Ca2+ influx by activating protein kinase pathways that phosphorylate AIS T-type Ca2+ channels (Perez-Reyes, 2003Perez-Reyes E. Molecular physiology of low-voltage-activated t-type calcium channels.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 117-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, Ron et al., 1999Ron D. Jiang Z. Yao L. Vagts A.

Fischbach P.S. McCleskey E.W. T-type calcium channels: heterogeneous expression in rat sensory neurons and selective modulation by phorbol esters.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 947-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the effects of quinpirole were mimicked by the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 10 μM, normalized ΔG/R: 0.55 ± 0.03, n = 6; Figures 1E and 1G), but not by the PKA activator forskolin (50 μM, normalized ΔG/R: 1.04 ± 0.06, n = 2). Further, quinpirole-mediated effects on AIS Ca2+ were blocked by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (1 μM) and the PKC inhibitor peptide PKC19–31 (5 μM, in pipette) (Figures 1F and 1G; quin. + GF: 0.95 ± 0.02, n = 6; quin. + PKC19–31: 0.98 ± 0.02, n = 3; PMA + PKC19–31: 0.92 ± 0.02, n = 6; p < 0.0001 for each blocker versus quinpirole). Thus, AIS Ca2+ channels were modulated by dopamine signaling via D3R-dependent activation of PKC. Pharmacological results suggest that D3R-PKC pathway modulates T-type channels in the AIS. To confirm these results, we isolated T-currents (IT) in voltage-clamp using a Cs+-based internal solution and an external solution containing TTX, Cs+, NBQX, strychnine, and SR95531. IT was isolated from other Ca2+ channel currents with voltage steps from −100 to −60 mV, and whole-cell IT was recorded while simultaneously imaging Ca2+ transients in the AIS and a neighboring dendritic branch (Figures 2A and 2B ). This voltage step protocol evoked −493 ± 46 pA IT in cartwheel cells (n = 28). Mibefradil blocked IT by 90.7% ± 1.1% and AIS and dendritic Ca2+ transients by 88.2% ± 1.1% and 86.5% ± 5.5%, respectively (n = 4 cells) (10 μM, required for block from −100 mV; McDonough and Bean, 1998McDonough S.I. Bean B.P. Mibefradil inhibition of T-type calcium channels in cerebellar purkinje neurons.Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1080-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Further, the CaV3.2 selective antagonist ascorbate (300 μM; Nelson et al., 2007Nelson M.T. Joksovic P.M. Su P. Kang H.W. Van Deusen A. Baumgart J.P. David L.S. Snutch T.P. Barrett P.Q. Lee J.H. et al.Molecular mechanisms of subtype-specific inhibition of neuronal T-type calcium channels by ascorbate.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12577-12583Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) decreased AIS and dendritic Ca2+ transients, as well as IT (Figures 2C and 2D; AIS normalized ΔG/R: 0.62 ± 0.06, dendrite: 0.75 ± 0.06; IT: 0.57 ± 0.07, n = 4). These data are consistent with previous results with 50 μM Ni2+ application (Bender and Trussell, 2009Bender K.J. Trussell L.O. Axon initial segment Ca2+ channels influence action potential generation and timing.Neuron. 2009; 61: 259-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and suggest that cartwheel cells express CaV3.2 channels in the AIS and dendrite. When the D3R-PKC pathway was activated with quinpirole or PMA, Ca2+ transients in the AIS were reduced, but surprisingly, Ca2+ transients in the dendrites were not (Figures 2B and 2D; e.g., quinpirole AIS normalized ΔG/R: 0.62 ± 0.06, dendrite: 0.96 ± 0.05, n = 5, p < 0.02, paired t test). IT was also unchanged (Figure 2C; quinpirole normalized IT: 1.03 ± 0.01, n = 5, PMA: 1.05 ± 0.03, n = 8; p > 0.5 versus control for each), probably because the contribution of dendritic T-type channels dominated the whole-cell IT; however, it was possible that the reduction in IT due to AIS Ca2+ channel block was small compared to the variance in IT observed over the course of an experiment. To test whether acute blockade of AIS Ca2+ channels could affect whole cell IT, we selectively blocked AIS Ca2+ channels with local Ni2+ iontophoresis (Bender and Trussell, 2009Bender K.J. Trussell L.O. Axon initial segment Ca2+ channels influence action potential generation and timing.Neuron. 2009; 61: 259-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In these experiments, control and Ni2+-paired currents were interleaved, eliminating time-dependent changes to IT. Local Ni2+ application reduced AIS Ca2+ transients more effectively than the D3R-PKC pathway (Figure 2D; normalized ΔG/R: 0.41 ± 0.08, n = 3, p < 0.01 versus quin. and PMA), but still whole-cell IT was unaffected (Figure 2C; normalized IT: 1.00 ± 0.002, p > 0.3 versus quinpirole or PMA). Similar results were obtained when the iontophoretic pipette was moved to an isolated dendritic branch (data not shown), confirming that local block of a small fraction of a cell's T-type channels cannot be resolved in whole-cell current recorded in the soma. Thus, dopamine regulates T-type Ca2+ channels localized to the AIS, not the dendrite. T-type channels contribute to neuronal excitation and are activated at relatively negative membrane potentials. As a result, partial blockade of T-type channels with local mibefradil or Ni2+ application results in elevation of AP thresholds. Indeed, APs evoked by a given synaptic input are either delayed or never initiated under these conditions (Bender and Trussell, 2009Bender K.J. Trussell L.O. Axon initial segment Ca2+ channels influence action potential generation and timing.Neuron. 2009; 61: 259-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Since the D3R-PKC pathway reduces AIS Ca2+ influx, its activation should have similar effects on neuronal output. To test this, we evoked APs with 30 ms current pulses just suprathreshold for bursts of 2–3 APs. Cartwheel cells reliably evoked bursts throughout whole-cell recordings (control recordings: 2.6 ± 0.3 APs/stim, 0–5 min; 2.5 ± 0.4 APs/stim, 15–20 min, n = 5), but when the D3R-PKC pathway was activated with either quinpirole or PMA, the number of APs evoked per stimulus was reduced by at least 50% (Figure 3; PMA: normalized APs/stim: 0.50 ± 0.18, n = 5; quin.: 0.35 ± 0.17, n = 5, p < 0.02 versus control for both). These effects were not due to changes in intrinsic membrane properties—resting membrane potential and input resistance were unaffected by PMA or quinpirole (Figure 3; e.g., baseline Vm: −80.1 ± 0.6 mV, PMA: −80.0 ± 0.6, p = 0.6; baseline Rin: 55.7 ± 8.3 MΩ, PMA: 54.1 ± 7.5, p = 0.36, paired t test). Rather, the reduced excitability was mediated by inhibition of T-type Ca2+ channels. When T-type channels were blocked with mibefradil (3 μM), cartwheel cells did not fire characteristic AP bursts (Kim and Trussell, 2007Kim Y. Trussell L.O. Ion channels generating complex spikes in cartwheel cells of the dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 1705-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When the stimulus intensity was then increased, the AIS could be depolarized enough to evoke 2 APs with a 30 ms current injection (Figure 3C; stim. intensity: PMA: 181 ± 21 pA; PMA + mibefradil: 327 ± 38 pA). Under these conditions, PMA did not affect AP output (normalized APs/stim: 0.92 ± 0.07, n = 4, p = 0.86 versus control), indicating that PMA reduced AP initiation through its actions on T-type channels. To quantify the elevation of spike threshold by the D3R-PKC pathway, we increased the stimulation intensity by 20 pA to ensure that the first AP in a burst would always be present, even in PMA or quinpirole. Relative to control experiments, AP threshold, as detected in phase plane plots, depolarized by 1.8 mV in quinpirole and by 1.5 mV in PMA (see Figure S1 available online; p < 0.05 for both). PMA did not affect threshold after blockade of T-type channels with mibefradil (relative depolarization: 0.2 ± 0.4 mV, p > 0.7 versus control), confirming that these effects were mediated by changes to T-type channel activity. These results indicate that AIS T-type channels are modulated by the D3R-PKC pathway; however, they do not exclude actions on other AIS ion channels. For example, dopaminergic suppression of Na+ channel function might have led to reduced activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the AIS. Indeed, dopaminergic signaling is reported to alter Na+ channel activity, although it is unclear if this modulation extends to AIS Na+ channels (Cantrell and Catterall, 2001Cantrell A.R.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10289-10301Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether quinpirole altered AIS Na+ channel activity by imaging Na+ with SBFI (1 mM). In these experiments, AIS Ca2+ channels were blocked with 100 μM Ni2+ to avoid indirect effects of Ca2+ channel modulation on Na+ influx. In many neurons, Na+ channel subtype expression varies with distance from the axon hillock. Typically, NaV1.1 or 1.2 channels are expressed in the proximal AIS, whereas NaV1.6 channels are more distal (Hu et al., 2009Hu W. Tian C. Li T. Yang M. Hou H. Shu Y.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 14329-14340Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). As these channels may be subject to different regulatory pathways, we imaged AP train-evoked Na+ transients at two locations (proximal: 9.7 ± 1.4 μm from the hillock; distal: 24.2 ± 2.2 μm, n = 5). Na+ transients from individual APs were clearly resolved with SBFI, and were not altered by 1 μM quinpirole (Figures 4A and 4C ; proximal normalized ΔF/F0: 1.01 ± 0.04, distal: 1.02 ± 0.02, n = 5, p > 0.5 for each location, one sample t test). To ensure that our imaging system could detect changes in Na+ influx that might underlie D3R-PKC pathway-mediated reductions in neuronal output, we first mimicked the effects of quinpirole and PMA by directly blocking Na+ channels with tetrodotoxin (TTX). We found that partial block of Na+ channels with 1 nM TTX was sufficient to reduce AP output to 47.1% ± 12.8% of baseline conditions (Figure S2; n = 7, p > 0.7 versus either quinpirole or PMA). Then, we again imaged Na+ transients in the proximal and distal AIS with SBFI. In contrast to quinpirole, 1 nM TTX reduced AP-evoked Na+ transients in both regions (Figures 4B and 4C; proximal normalized ΔF/F0: 0.76 ± 0.04, distal: 0.78 ± 0.03, n = 6, p < 0.01 for both, one-sample t test). This reduction in SBFI signal was comparable to the block of Na+ currents observed by voltage clamping NaV1.1, 1.2 and 1.6 channels in heterologous expression systems (Rosker et al., 2007Rosker C. Lohberger B. Hofer D. Steinecker B. Quasthoff S. Schreibmayer W. The TTX metabolite 4,9-anhydro-TTX is a highly specific blocker of the Na(v1.6) voltage-dependent sodium channel.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293: C783-C789Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and indicate that quinpirole had no effect on AIS Na+ influx. While transient Na+ currents cannot be clamped well in whole-cell recordings from dendritic neurons, subthreshold, persistent Na+ currents can. Both persistent and transient Na+ currents may originate from the same Na+ channel source in the AIS (Astman et al., 2006Astman N. Gutnick M.J. Fleidervish I.A.

Subthreshold sodium current from rapidly inactivating sodium channels drives spontaneous firing of tuberomammillary neurons.Neuron. 2002; 33: 587-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Therefore, whole-cell persistent Na+ currents provide a second, independent measure of whether quinpirole affects AIS Na+ channels. TTX-sensitive currents were isolated with voltage steps from −90 to −60 mV in the presence of K+ channel, Ca2+ channel, and ionotropic blockers (Figure 4D; see Experimental Procedures). Consistent with results obtained with SBFI, quinpirole did not alter persistent Na+ currents (normalized current: 0.99 ± 0.01, n = 6; p > 0.4, one-sample t test). Dopaminergic signaling did not alter Vm or Rin in current clamp recordings (Figure 3). This suggests that cartwheel cells lack dopamine-sensitive inward-rectifying K+ conductances; however, it was still unclear whether dopamine affected other K+ conductances. To address this, we examined K+ currents with voltage steps from −80 to +20 mV (10 mV increments), activating K+ conductances through the full AP voltage range (Figures 4E and 4F). As with Na+ currents, quinpirole had no effect (e.g., normalized curre"

Dysregulation of Treg function has been shown to be involved in different kinds of immunological diseases ranging from the digestive to the central nervous system (4.Sakaguchi S. Yamaguchi T.

A key role for CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4), a co-receptor expressed preferentially on Tregs, is implicated in the Treg suppression mechanism (1.Wing K. Sakaguchi S. Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 8.Miyara M. Sakaguchi S. Trends Mol.

Science. 2008; 322: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar). CTLA-4 interacts with CD80/CD86 (cluster of differentiation) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and transduces an intracellular inhibitory signal to APCs. Thus, one strategy for Treg-dependent immunosuppression is via down-regulation of APC function (1.Wing K. Sakaguchi S. Nat.

Med. 2000; 192: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation by T cells, DCs increase uptake of cystine via the xc− cystine transporter and, by a convoluted metabolic route involving the γ-glutamyl cycle, furnish Cysex, resulting in a relatively more reducing redox potential that is conducive to T cell proliferation (2.Yan Z. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9.Yan Z. Garg S.K. Kipnis J. Banerjee R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 721-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cysteine is needed by T cells for synthesis of GSH, which provides reducing power for DNA synthesis (14.Avval F.Z. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8233-8240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and for cell cycle progression from the G1 to S phase (15.Suthanthiran M.

Immunol. 1989; 143: 1974-1981PubMed Google Scholar). Although extracellular cystine is relatively abundant, naïve T cells are inefficient at transporting cystine, the oxidized form of the amino acid cysteine, and depend on DC-derived cysteine to meet their metabolic needs (17.Garg, S. K., Yan, Z., Vitvitsky, V., Banerjee, R., (2010) Antioxid. Redox Signal., in pressGoogle Scholar). By controlling the Cysex level, DCs are able to affect intracellular GSH levels and subsequent redox signaling pathways in T cells (2.Yan Z. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).The physiological relevance of redox remodeling is demonstrated by the dramatic increase in non-protein thiols in lymphoid tissues following immunization (18.Castellani P. Angelini G. Delfino L. Matucci A. Rubartelli A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2008; 38: 2419-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Additionally, Peyer's patches from the intestine show very low thiol staining because resident APCs from the lamina propria lack the xc− transporter for cystine. However, under inflammatory conditions as in inflammatory bowel diseases, infiltration of peripheral APCs with high xc− transporter expression allows Cysex accumulation, promoting activation and hyperreactivity of lamina propria T cells (19.Sido B. Lasitschka F. Giese T. Gassler N. Funke B. Schröder-Braunstein J. Brunnemer U. Meuer S.C. Autschbach F. Gastroenterology. 2008; 134: 179-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that Tregs suppress Cysex accumulation and that this is correlated with suppression of T cell activation and proliferation (9.Yan Z. Garg S.K. Kipnis J. Banerjee R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 721-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Tregs interfere with the redox signaling cross-talk between DCs and effector T cells (Teffs) is unknown.In this study, we demonstrate that Tregs decrease Cysex levels in an antigen-dependent but antigen-nonspecific and CTLA-4-dependent manner. We show that Tregs use multiple strategies for changing the extracellular redox potential, including modulation of DC and Teff GSH metabolism and competitive uptake of cysteine. This study provides the first mechanistic insights into how Tregs influence redox metabolism in DCs and, consequently, in Teffs.DISCUSSIONAlthough the requirement for a reducing microenvironment to support T cell activation and proliferation has been known for quite some time (12.Angelini G. Gardella S. Ardy M. Ciriolo M.R. Filomeni G. Di Trapani G. Clarke F. Sitia R. Rubartelli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 1491-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 31.Ishii T. Hishinuma I. Bannai S. Sugita Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1981; 107: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), redox modulation has emerged as an immunosuppressive strategy only recently (2.Yan Z. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9.Yan Z. Garg S.K. Kipnis J. Banerjee R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 721-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have previously described this novel suppression mechanism whereby Tregs cause an oxidative shift in the extracellular redox environment during DC-dependent T cell activation (9.Yan Z. Garg S.K. Kipnis J. Banerjee R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 721-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that Tregs deploy multiple strategies for inhibiting DC-dependent extracellular redox remodeling (Fig. 6).Activation of Teffs requires interaction between the TCR and a specific antigen presented by MHC class II molecules. However, the antigen specificity for the suppressive action of Tregs is controversial. Although several studies suggest that Tregs suppress in an antigen-restricted manner in vitro and in vivo (32.Corthay A. Scand J. Immunol. 2009; 70: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 33.Yu P. Gregg R.K. Bell J.J. Ellis J.S. Divekar R. Lee H.H. Jain R. Waldner H. Hardaway J.C. Collins M. Kuchroo V.K.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 4285-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), others report that Tregs do not require specific TCR-antigen interaction for suppression of Teff proliferation (35.Szymczak-Workman A.L. Workman C.J. Vignali D.A. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 5188-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 36.Homann D. Holz A. Bot A. Coon B. Wolfe T. Petersen J. Dyrberg T.P. Grusby M.J. von Herrath M.G. Immunity. 1999; 11: 463-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that although remodeling of the extracellular environment by Tregs is antigen-dependent, it is not antigen-specific. These results are consistent with the observations of Vignali and co-workers (35.Szymczak-Workman A.L. Workman C.J. Vignali D.A. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 5188-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), who have shown that Tregs can suppress Teffs derived from mouse strains with distinct antigen specificities. Hence, Tregs might harbor constitutive suppressive activity and mediate redox remodeling via a bystander suppression mechanism.Recent studies by Sakaguchi and co-workers (1.Wing K. Sakaguchi S. Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 10.Wing K. Onishi Y. Prieto-Martin P. Yamaguchi T. Miyara M. Fehervari Z. Nomura T. Sakaguchi S. Science. 2008; 322: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar) demonstrate an essential role for CTLA-4 in immunosuppression by Tregs. Foxp3, a transcription factor needed for Treg function, regulates CTLA-4 expression. The addition of anti-CTLA-4 antibody or disruption of the CTLA-4 gene in Tregs blocks Treg suppression and causes a variety of autoimmune diseases (10.Wing K. Onishi Y. Prieto-Martin P. Yamaguchi T. Miyara M. Fehervari Z. Nomura T. Sakaguchi S. Science. 2008; 322: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar, 37.Sakaguchi S. Wing K. Onishi Y. Prieto-Martin P. Yamaguchi T. Int. Immunol. 2009; 21: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that Treg-mediated redox remodeling is both contact- and CTLA-4-dependent. Administration of anti-CTLA-4 antibody blocked the Treg effect on Cysex, GSHex, GSHin, and γ-glutamyl synthetase expression, suggesting that CTLA-4 plays an important role in several aspects of redox remodeling by Tregs. By interacting with CD80/CD86 on DCs, Treg-derived CTLA-4 triggers several signaling pathways in DCs, including activation of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase expression and induction of the Foxo3 transcription factor (27.Grohmann U. Orabona C. Fallarino F. Vacca C. Calcinaro F. Falorni A. Candeloro P. Belladonna M.L. Bianchi R. Fioretti M.C. Puccetti P. Nat.

Immunol. 2009; 10: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Tregs are known to restrain the maturation and antigen-presenting capacity of DCs by down-regulating expression of CD80/CD86 co-stimulatory molecules on DCs (38.Cederbom L. Hall H. Ivars F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1538-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 39.Misra N. Bayry J. Lacroix-Desmazes S. Kazatchkine M.D. Kaveri S.V. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4676-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar).We found that GSH synthesis in LPS-stimulated DCs is down-regulated by Tregs, which is consistent with lower GSH extrusion by DCs and, consequently, lower Cysex generation via the γ-glutamyl cycle. The regulatory cross-talk between Tregs and APCs has been extensively investigated. Because Foxo3 is activated via CTLA-4 signaling and Foxo3 is a sensor and regulator of redox signaling (29.Dejean A.S. Beisner D.R. Ch'en I.L. Kerdiles Y.M. Babour A. Arden K.C. Castrillon D.H.

Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar), a potential link between this transcription factor and the γ-glutamyl cycle merits investigation.The maintenance of GSHin levels requires the availability and transport of cysteine, the amino acid that limits GSH synthesis. Because cysteine is easily oxidized to cystine in the oxidizing extracellular milieu, the concentration of cysteine in the plasma is much lower than of cystine (41.Eck H.P. Gmünder H. Hartmann M. Petzoldt D. Daniel V. Dröge W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, the cystine transporter activity in naïve T cells is very low compared with the cysteine transporter activity (42.Ishii T. Sugita Y. Bannai S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), making them dependent on APCs to meet their cysteine needs (2.Yan Z. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9.Yan Z. Garg S.K. Kipnis J. Banerjee R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 721-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12.Angelini G. Gardella S. Ardy M. Ciriolo M.R. Filomeni G. Di Trapani G. Clarke F. Sitia R. Rubartelli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 1491-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). DCs express the xc− cystine transporter and import cystine efficiently, stimulating Cysex accumulation during T cell activation (9.Yan Z. Garg S.K. Kipnis J. Banerjee R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 721-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12.Angelini G. Gardella S. Ardy M. Ciriolo M.R. Filomeni G. Di Trapani G. Clarke F. Sitia R. Rubartelli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 1491-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). This response is inhibited by Tregs at multiple levels, including consumption of cysteine and its preferential oxidation to sulfate. However, the in vivo significance of this competitive mechanism for diminishing Cysex is uncertain because Teffs outnumber Tregs, which represent only ∼5–10% of total CD4+ T cells (3.Sakaguchi S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 531-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar).GSH plays essential roles in T cell functions, including DNA synthesis (15.Suthanthiran M. Anderson M.E. Sharma V.K. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 3343-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 43.Pallardó F.V. Markovic J. García J.L. Viña J. Mol. Aspects Med. 2009; 30: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Perturbation of GSHin levels and the GSH/GSSG redox status dramatically affects T cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and cytotoxic T cell activity (44.Grimble R.F. J. Nutr. 2006; 136: 1660S-1665SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). GSHin levels also substantially influence T cell signal transduction pathways involving tyrosine phosphorylation, AP-1, and NFκB (45.Staal F.J. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 28: 194-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Bcl-2 (B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2) results in increased GSH levels by recruiting GSH to the nucleus to prevent apoptosis (46.Voehringer D.W. McConkey D.J. McDonnell T.J. Brisbay S. Meyn R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2956-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). GSH is concentrated in the nucleus during the early stage of cell proliferation and is distributed more evenly when cells reach confluency. GSH regulates nuclear protein functions via glutathionylation, which also protects protein thiols from further oxidation (24.Markovic J. Borrás C. Ortega A. Sastre J. Viña J. Pallardó F.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20416-20424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although our analysis of cytoplasmic versus nuclear GSH pools is limited by the technical challenges discussed above, at least qualitatively, the data suggest that GSH is concentrated in the nucleus in naïve T cells but is more diffusely distributed in T cells undergoing activation and proliferation. Progression through the cell cycle is correlated with metabolism-linked redox changes (47.Menon S.G. Goswami P.C. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and inhibition of GSH relocalization dynamics by Tregs might represent one mechanism of inhibition of Teff proliferation. Although the significance of GSH relocalization from the nuclear to the cytoplasmic compartment for Teff proliferation is not known, it is interesting that the inhibitory effect of Tregs on GSHin dynamics is alleviated by exogenous cysteine added at a concentration seen under DC/T cell co-culture conditions.In summary, our study reveals that Tregs deploy multiple strategies for perturbing the extracellular redox environment during T cell activation, affecting both DCs and Tn cells. Elucidation of the signaling pathways that connect Treg engagement and the redox metabolic responses uncovered in this study might allow identification of potentially novel therapeutic targets. IntroductionA fundamental property of the immune system is to distinguish self from non-self. During maturation of T cells in thymus, autoreactive T cells are recognized and eliminated. However, a small fraction of autoimmune T cells escape to the periphery and cause damage to host tissues. By mechanisms that are not well understood, regulatory T cells (Tregs) 2The abbreviations used are: Tregregulatory T cellDCdendritic cellCysexextracellular cysteineTnnaïve TAPCantigen-presenting cellTCRT cell receptorTeffeffector T cellOVA323–329ovalbumin-(323–329)GSHinintracellular GSHCMFDA5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate. are able to inhibit autoimmune T cells to maintain self-tolerance and immunosuppression (1.Wing K.

However, the mechanism by which Tregs interfere with the redox signaling cross-talk between DCs and effector T cells (Teffs) is unknown.In this study, we demonstrate that Tregs decrease Cysex levels in an antigen-dependent but antigen-nonspecific and CTLA-4-dependent manner. We show that Tregs use multiple strategies for changing the extracellular redox potential, including modulation of DC and Teff GSH metabolism and competitive uptake of cysteine. This study provides the first mechanistic insights into how Tregs influence redox metabolism in DCs and, consequently, in Teffs. A fundamental property of the immune system is to distinguish self from non-self. During maturation of T cells in thymus, autoreactive T cells are recognized and eliminated. However, a small fraction of autoimmune T cells escape to the periphery and cause damage to host tissues.

This plasticity is tightly regulated during embryonic development and mediated by the exquisitely coordinated activation and repression of groups of genes. Genes that become repressed are immersed in a condensed chromatin environment that renders them refractory to stimulation. This mechanism is responsible for both the loss of cell plasticity during differentiation and the preservation of cell identity. Understanding the molecular events involved in the establishment and maintenance of these restrictive domains will benefit the design of strategies for cellular reprogramming, differentiation, and cancer treatment."

IntroductionThe formation of bile by the liver depends on the transport functions of two complimentary cell types: hepatocytes and intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells, known as cholangiocytes. Although cholangiocytes account for only ∼2–5% of the nuclear mass of the liver (1Kumar U. Jordan T.W. Liver. 1986; 6: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), they have a prodigious capacity for secretion (2Preisig R. Cooper H.L. Wheeler H.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1962; 41: 1152-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 3Wheeler H.O. Ramos O.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1960; 39: 161-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may account for up to 40% of bile volume in humans through regulated ion and water transport (4Fitz J.G. Semin. Liver Dis. 2002; 22: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Opening of Cl− channels in the apical membrane of cholangiocytes represents the driving force for ductular secretion and at least two Cl− conductances contribute (5Fitz J.G. Basavappa S. McGill J. Melhus O. Cohn J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The best characterized pathway involves cAMP-stimulated opening of Cl− channels encoded by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 2The abbreviations used are: CFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorNRCnormal rat cholangiocyte(s)MLCmouse large cholangiocytesMSCmouse small cholangiocytesBDLbile duct-ligated.

Physiol. 1994; 266: G731-G736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, there is a separate Ca2+-activated Cl− channel (CaCC) that is involved, but the molecular identity of this channel has not been defined (5Fitz J.G. Basavappa S. McGill J. Melhus O. Cohn J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 7Schlenker T. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G304-G310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Increasing evidence suggests that the dominant mechanism for regulation of biliary secretion involves (i) autocrine/paracrine release of ATP into bile, (ii) activation by ATP of purinergic receptors, and (iii) mobilization of intracellular calcium and activation of CaCCs. The magnitude of the Cl− secretory response to ATP is greater than that to cAMP in single human biliary epithelial cells and polarized rat cholangiocyte monolayers (8Dutta A.K. Woo K. Doctor R.B. Fitz J.G. Feranchak A.P. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2008; 295: G1004-G1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many of the effects of cAMP on bile formation appear to be mediated by ATP release into the duct lumen and subsequent activation of apical P2 receptors (9Minagawa N. Nagata J. Shibao K. Masyuk A.I. Gomes D.A. Rodrigues M.A. Lesage G. Akiba Y. Kaunitz J.D. Ehrlich B.E. Larusso N.F. Nathanson M.H.

These general findings are consistent with the clinical observation that only 10–20% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) develop clinically significant liver disease despite absent or abnormal CFTR in biliary epithelium (11Colombo C.

Disease. 2001; 21: 471-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in cells with the CF phenotype, activation of P2 receptors still elicits potent secretory responses (13Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Clarke L.L. Harline M.C. Gawenis L.R. Walker N.M. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2000; 279: G132-G138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these findings challenge the conventional model that centers on the concept that cAMP-dependent opening of CFTR-related Cl− channels is the driving force for cholangiocyte secretion. Rather, the operative regulatory pathways appear to take place within the lumen of intrahepatic ducts, where release of ATP into bile is a final common pathway controlling ductular bile formation. Accordingly, molecular definition of the CaCC channel(s) involved has a high priority for future efforts to modulate the volume and composition of bile.Several candidate proteins have been proposed as CaCCs in other epithelia, including CLC and bestrophin family members (15Hartzell C. Putzier I. Arreola J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 719-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). However, the biophysical properties of the currents associated with these proteins are not consistent with the ATP-stimulated Cl− currents described in biliary epithelium (8Dutta A.K. Woo K. Doctor R.B. Fitz J.G. Feranchak A.P. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2008; 295: G1004-G1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). More recently, TMEM16A, a 114-kDa membrane protein with eight putative transmembrane domains, has been identified as a CaCC in other epithelium (16Caputo A. Caci E. Ferrera L. Pedemonte N.

Although TMEM16A is found in liver (19Ferrera L. Caputo A. Ubby I. Bussani E. Zegarra-Moran O. Ravazzolo R. Pagani F. Galietta L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 33360-33368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), its cellular localization and function are unknown.The aim of the present studies was to identify the molecular basis for Ca2+-activated Cl− currents stimulated by extracellular nucleotides in different biliary cell models. We have utilized single cells (human and mouse), polarized biliary monolayers (rat), and novel models of small and large cholangiocytes isolated from distinct areas of the intrahepatic bile ducts (mouse) to critically assess the potential role of TMEM16A in regulating membrane Cl− permeability and biliary secretion. Lastly, we have explored the potential role of IL-4 on TMEM16A channel expression and function, which may have important implications for Cl− secretion during cholestasis.DISCUSSIONIn these studies of human, rat, and mouse biliary epithelial cells, we have identified TMEM16A as the molecular basis for Ca2+-activated Cl− channels stimulated by extracellular nucleotides. Furthermore, we have identified the mechanism by which small cholangiocytes, which do not express CFTR (35Glaser S.S. Gaudio E. Rao A. Pierce L.M. Onori P. Franchitto A. Francis H.L. Dostal D.E. Venter J.K. DeMorrow S. Mancinelli R. Carpino G. Alvaro D. Kopriva S.E. Savage J.M. Alpini G.D. Lab. Invest. 2009; 89: 456-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), contribute to ductular secretion. Lastly, the finding that IL-4 up-regulates biliary TMEM16A expression and nucleotide-stimulated secretion may have important implications for cholestatic liver diseases associated with proinflammatory mediators. Accordingly, these studies represent the first molecular identification of a non-CFTR Cl− channel in biliary epithelium and therefore compliment and extend the original biophysical characterization of Cl− currents in biliary epithelial cells first published almost 20 years ago (5Fitz J.G. Basavappa S. McGill J. Melhus O. Cohn J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). As these are the first studies of TMEM16A in biliary epithelium, several points are in order.First, although these studies demonstrate a predominant role of TMEM16A in ATP-stimulated Cl− secretion, we cannot exclude contributions from other Cl− channels or TMEM16 isoforms. TMEM16A/ANO-1 is a 114-kDa membrane protein with 960 amino acids and eight transmembrane domains and is one of the 10 members of TMEM16/ANO family of proteins (16Caputo A. Caci E. Ferrera L. Pedemonte N. Barsanti C. Sondo E. Pfeffer U. Ravazzolo R. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J. Science. 2008; 322: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 17Yang Y.D. Cho H. Koo J.Y. Tak M.H.

Cell. 2008; 134: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) and TMEM16B/ANO2 (42Stephan A.B. Shum E.Y. Hirsh S. Cygnar K.D. Reisert J. Zhao H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 11776-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 43Stöhr H. Heisig J.B. Benz P.M. Schöberl S. Milenkovic V.M. Strauss O. Aartsen W.M. Wijnholds J. Weber B.H. Schulz H.L. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 6809-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) are associated with Ca2+-activated Cl− currents in other epithelia. In the current studies, TMEM16A was identified in all biliary models, whereas TMEM16B was not present in any models. Furthermore, TMEM16A gene silencing decreased protein expression by 75% which corresponded to a 75% decrease in the magnitude of Ca2+-activated Cl− current density as assessed by whole-cell patch clamp. The residual Cl− currents may be secondary to residual TMEM16A protein (due to the less than 100% efficiency of gene silencing), and the correlation between the decrease in TMEM16A protein expression and Cl− currents provides strong evidence that this is the predominant operative channel. However, the possibility that the other TMEM16 isoforms (f, j, and k) identified in biliary epithelium form novel Cl−-permeable heteromultimers cannot be excluded.Second, the studies in polarized NRC monolayers demonstrate that TMEM16A is activated through nucleotides binding P2 receptors on the apical membrane. This is in contrast to CFTR, which is activated by binding of secretin to basolateral receptors (6McGill J.M. Basavappa S. Gettys T.W. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G731-G736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, TMEM16A represents a critical member of the purinergic signaling pathway involved in hepatobiliary coupling, by which ATP released into bile by hepatocytes can stimulate P2 receptors on downstream cholangiocytes to increase ductular Cl− transport. Together with the recent findings demonstrating that fluid flow, or shear, at the cholangiocyte apical membrane is a potent stimulus for ATP release (44Woo K. Dutta A.K. Patel V. Kresge C. Feranchak A.P. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 2779-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), a model emerges in which increases in bile flow rate or viscosity is transmitted to mechanosensitive ATP release, autocrine/paracrine P2 receptor binding, and TMEM16A-mediated increases in membrane Cl− permeability, ultimately resulting in bile dilution.Third, these studies suggest that TMEM16A represents a potential target for regulation of secretion by cAMP-independent pathways and for pharmacological therapy of cystic fibrosis and other cholestatic liver diseases. In fact, in other secretory cells, the level of expression of Cl− channels other than CFTR is an important determinant of organ level disease in CF (45Clarke L.L. Grubb B.R. Yankaskas J.R. Cotton C.U. McKenzie A. Boucher R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In the CF mouse model for example, increased Ca2+-activated Cl− channel expression in respiratory epithelium is associated with mild pulmonary disease (45Clarke L.L. Grubb B.R. Yankaskas J.R. Cotton C.U. McKenzie A. Boucher R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Additionally, gallbladder epithelium from CF mice exhibits brisk secretory responses in response to UTP (14Clarke L.L. Harline M.C. Gawenis L.R. Walker N.M. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2000; 279: G132-G138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that nucleotide-stimulated secretion, via Ca2+-activated pathways, represents a viable strategy to increase secretion and bile flow in CF biliary epithelium.Fourth, these studies are the first to identify the molecular basis of secretion in small mouse cholangiocytes isolated from small “upstream” intrahepatic ducts (<15 μm in diameter) (27Ueno Y. Alpini G. Yahagi K. Kanno N. Moritoki Y. Fukushima K. Glaser S. LeSage G. Shimosegawa T. Liver Int. 2003; 23: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As far as we know, these are the first patch clamp studies to compare the biophysical properties of cholangiocytes isolated from distinct segments of the intrahepatic bile duct. Small cholangiocytes do not express CFTR and do not exhibit cAMP-stimulated Cl− secretion (35Glaser S.S. Gaudio E. Rao A. Pierce L.M. Onori P. Franchitto A. Francis H.L. Dostal D.E. Venter J.K. DeMorrow S. Mancinelli R. Carpino G. Alvaro D. Kopriva S.E. Savage J.M. Alpini G.D. Lab. Invest. 2009; 89: 456-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It seemed unusual that these small, cholangiocytes forming the smallest ducts, and the first to be exposed to canalicular bile rich in bile acids, did not possess the necessary secretory apparatus to increase fluid secretion and dilute bile. The identification of robust ATP-stimulated Ca2+-activated Cl− efflux via TMEM16A provides an answer.Lastly, cholestasis may have profound effects on cholangiocyte Cl− transport through down-regulation of IP3 receptors (46Shibao K. Hirata K. Robert M.E. Nathanson M.H. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1175-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and altered Ca2+ and cAMP signaling (46Shibao K. Hirata K. Robert M.E. Nathanson M.H. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1175-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These effects may be mediated in part by proinflammatory cytokines that are elevated during cholestasis. For example, IL-5 may have direct effects on CFTR expression and cAMP-stimulated Cl− transport (41McGill J.M. Yen M.S. Cummings O.W. Alpini G. LeSage G. Pollok K.E. Miller B. Engle S.K. Stansfield A.P. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2001; 280: G738-G745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, IL-4 appears to mediate an adaptive response through up-regulation of TMEM16A expression resulting in an increase in transepithelial secretion. Thus, interleukin-mediated effects on channel expression and/or function may be complex within the inflammatory milieu of the cholestatic liver with some interleukins increasing, and others decreasing, cellular transport. Defining the roles of interleukins in channel expression and regulation may have important implications during cholestasis.In summary, these studies have identified the molecular identity of the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel responsible for nucleotide-mediated secretion in biliary epithelium. Modulation of TMEM16A, or other components of the ATP-stimulated secretory apparatus, might provide novel strategies for the management of liver diseases characterized by impaired bile flow. IntroductionThe formation of bile by the liver depends on the transport functions of two complimentary cell types: hepatocytes and intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells, known as cholangiocytes.

After fusion, the ATPase NSF and its cofactors α- and βSNAP disassemble SNARE complexes, thereby recycling individual SNAREs for subsequent fusion reactions. We examined the effects of genetic perturbation of α- and βSNAP expression on synaptic vesicle exocytosis, employing a new Ca2+ uncaging protocol to study synaptic vesicle trafficking, priming, and fusion in small glutamatergic synapses of hippocampal neurons. By characterizing this protocol, we show that synchronous and asynchronous transmitter release involve different Ca2+ sensors and are not caused by distinct releasable vesicle pools, and that tonic transmitter release is due to ongoing priming and fusion of new synaptic vesicles during high synaptic activity. Our analysis of α- and βSNAP deletion mutant neurons shows that the two NSF cofactors support synaptic vesicle priming by determining the availability of free SNARE components, particularly during phases of high synaptic activity.

Neurons signal by releasing neurotransmitters at chemical synapses. The release process is mediated by the fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs), which is triggered by Ca2+ ions and executed by SNARE proteins. The latter reside on the SV (Synaptobrevin-2) and synaptic plasma membrane (Syntaxin-1, SNAP-25), and their zipper-like assembly into a tight complex drives the membrane fusion reaction (Jahn and Scheller, 2006Jahn R. Scheller R.H. SNAREs—engines for membrane fusion.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar). The fidelity of transmitter release in the brain is ensured by regulatory processes that control SV trafficking and SNARE complex function. At active synapses, SVs are continuously supplied to release sites where they undergo a Munc13/CAPS-dependent priming reaction that initiates SNARE complex formation and renders tethered SVs fusion-competent. Only such primed SVs, forming the pool of readily releasable SVs (RRP), can fuse with the plasma membrane upon arrival of an action potential (AP), the concomitant increase of the presynaptic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), and activation of the putative SV Ca2+ sensor Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt-1). After fusion, SNARE complex components are dissociated and recycled by an α/βSNAP-NSF complex, and SV membrane and protein components are recovered by endocytosis (Sudhof, 2004Sudhof T.C. The synaptic vesicle cycle.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar, Wojcik and Brose, 2007Wojcik S.M. Brose N.

Depending on the activity of a given synapse, different SV trafficking steps become rate limiting for synaptic signaling and kinetically different release mechanisms are employed. This causes short-term changes in synaptic transmission that determine many higher brain functions such as sound localization, sensory adaptation, or even working memory (Wojcik and Brose, 2007Wojcik S.M. Brose N. Regulation of membrane fusion in synaptic excitation-secretion coupling: Speed and accuracy matter.Neuron. 2007; 55: 11-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Munc13/CAPS-dependent SV priming, for example, regulates presynaptic depression, facilitation, and augmentation, depending on the synapse type and protein isoform involved (Wojcik and Brose, 2007Wojcik S.M.

At most synapses, two release processes are observed, i.e., synchronous or phasic release that is tightly coupled to incoming APs and asynchronous release that occurs with some delay. The two release processes were suggested to arise from distinct pools of fusion competent SVs (Goda and Stevens, 1994Goda Y. Stevens C.F.

Both phasic and tonic release modes are subject to short-term regulation, and in several cases they are differentially affected by synaptic activity or by genetic perturbation of key SV trafficking steps. In principle, α/βSNAP-dependent SNARE complex disassembly might influence both phasic and tonic transmitter release modes as well as their short-term plasticity. Indeed, functional inactivation of the α/βSNAP-dependent SNARE complex disassembly ATPase NSF in temperature-sensitive Drosophila mutants leads to a progressive defect in transmitter release and consequent paralysis (Littleton et al., 2001Littleton J.T. Barnard R.J. Titus S.A. Slind J. Chapman E.R. Ganetzky B. SNARE-complex disassembly by NSF follows synaptic-vesicle fusion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 12233-12238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Constitutive deletion of αSNAP in mice leads to embryonic lethality, and a 50% reduction of αSNAP expression in the hypomorphic “Hydrocephaly with Hop-gait” (HYH) mutant (Chae et al., 2004Chae T.H. Kim S. Marz K.E. Hanson P.I. Walsh C.A. The HYH mutation uncovers roles for alpha Snap in apical protein localization and control of neural cell fate.Nat.

USA. 2004; 101: 1748-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) causes complex and as yet poorly understood changes in apical protein localization and cell fate determination in neuroepithelial cells. A detailed genetic analysis of the function of α- and βSNAP in transmitter release from mammalian neurons has not been performed to date. Because of their interdependence, it has been very difficult to study individual SV trafficking steps, their molecular basis, their contribution to synchronous, asynchronous, and tonic release, and their role in presynaptic short-term plasticity, particularly in small glutamatergic synapses, which are the most abundant in the mammalian brain. We have circumvented this problem by stimulating transmitter release in autaptic mouse hippocampal glutamatergic neurons using UV-flash mediated Ca2+ uncaging (Sakaba, 2008Sakaba T. Two Ca2+-dependent steps controlling synaptic vesicle fusion and replenishment at the cerebellar basket cell terminal.Neuron. 2008; 57: 406-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, Schneggenburger and Neher, 2000Schneggenburger R. Neher E. Intracellular calcium dependence of transmitter release rates at a fast central synapse.Nature. 2000; 406: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). This bypasses Ca2+ channel activation and coupling to the release machinery, and allowed us to study individual steps of the SV cycle in hippocampal synapses at an unprecedented level of detail. We applied the Ca2+ uncaging method to determine SV dynamics in neurons of previously described mouse deletion mutants (CAPS-1/2, Munc13-1/2, Syt-1) and to study the functional role of α- and βSNAP in presynaptic function and short-term plasticity using novel mutant mice. Our study provides important new insights into the nature of synchronous, asynchronous, and tonic transmitter release, and the role of SNARE protein recycling in determining the fidelity of synaptic transmission during high synaptic activity. We chose cultured autaptic hippocampal neurons as our model system to establish a Ca2+ uncaging protocol for the study of small glutamatergic synapses. Synaptic transmission in this preparation has mainly been studied by inducing APs through a patch pipette while the RRP has been determined with hypertonic sucrose solution (HSS) (Jockusch et al., 2007Jockusch W.J. Speidel D. Sigler A. Sorensen J.B. Varoqueaux F. Rhee J.S. Brose N. CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 are essential synaptic vesicle priming proteins.Cell. 2007; 131: 796-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To test whether Ca2+ uncaging can be used to release the entire RRP, wild-type (WT) neurons were loaded with NP-EGTA, Mag-Fura-2, and Fura-4F (Figure 1B ). [Ca2+]i was measured in the distal dendrite (third order branches) as routine measurements of [Ca2+]i in axons or presynaptic terminals was not feasible. After 20 min of cell dialysis, a brief UV flash was delivered, which elevated [Ca2+]i to ∼30 μM. Longer dialysis times were only necessary in neurons that had been cultured for more than 10 days due to the higher axonal complexity. We therefore focused our study on neurons at days in vitro 7–10. Rapid elevation of [Ca2+]i to 20–30 μM triggered a fast postsynaptic current (EPSC) within ∼1 ms (Figures 1A–1C), followed by a long-lasting EPSC. The amplitude of the fast flash-evoked EPSC was three times larger than the AP-evoked EPSC amplitude. The EPSC induced by Ca2+ uncaging was abolished by AMPA receptor blockers and in Munc13-1/2 double KO (Munc13-DKO) neurons, which are deficient in transmitter release (Wojcik and Brose, 2007Wojcik S.M. Brose N. Regulation of membrane fusion in synaptic excitation-secretion coupling: Speed and accuracy matter.Neuron. 2007; 55: 11-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) (see Figure S1A available online). APs (Figure 1A) and HSS (Figure S1C) applied after the flash failed to trigger additional glutamate release. The lack of AP evoked release after Ca2+ uncaging was not due to a failure of AP propagation since AP-triggered EPSCs could be reliably evoked in earlier phases of cell perfusion, during which the caged Ca2+ had entered the axon but not all presynaptic terminals (Figure S1B). Likewise, the lack of AP-evoked release after Ca2+ uncaging is unlikely to be caused solely by Ca2+-dependent inactivation of presynaptic Ca2+ channels due to elevated postflash [Ca2+]i. We addressed this issue indirectly by examining changes in somatic voltage dependent Ca2+ currents of the N-, P/Q-, and R-types before and after Ca2+ uncaging in the presence of 5 μM nimodipine, an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker. For a postflash [Ca2+]i of ∼20 μM, we measured a reduction of somatic Ca2+ currents by ∼50% (data not shown). On the other hand, AP-evoked EPSCs after flash were reduced by more than 99% (i.e., to the noise level) as compared to preflash control values (Figure 1A). Elevated [Ca2+]i after Ca2+ uncaging reduces the number of Ca2+ channels available for opening during a presynaptic AP. The effect of a reduced number of open Ca2+ channels on transmitter release depends on the coupling between Ca2+ channels and the vesicle fusion machinery. If many Ca2+ channels control the fusion of a single SV, the cooperativity between Ca2+ current and transmitter release will be close to the biochemical cooperativity, i.e., ∼3, but if only very few Ca2+ channels control the fusion of a single SV, the cooperativity between Ca2+ current and transmitter release will approach 1. Thus, a relative reduction in Ca2+ currents by a factor of 0.5 (∼50%), as we observed, is expected to reduce the EPSC by a factor of 0.51–0.53 or 0.5–0.125. To explain the reduction of the postflash EPSC by a factor of 0.01 (99%) seen in our experiments (Figure 1A), one would need to assume a reduction of Ca2+ currents by a factor of 0.01–0.22, which was not the case. On aggregate, above findings show that under our assay conditions NP-EGTA had effectively diffused into all presynaptic terminals and that elevation of [Ca2+]i by Ca2+ uncaging induced the release of the entire RRP. Thus, EPSCs induced by Ca2+ uncaging are a novel readout of the Ca2+ dependent release of the entire RRP in hippocampal neurons. As RRP release by Ca2+ uncaging occludes HSS-induced RRP release (Figure S1C), we next tested the reverse by first triggering RRP release with HSS and then delivering an AP followed by a flash in the continuous presence of HSS. Although a single AP did not induce any release after RRP depletion by HSS, Ca2+ uncaging still evoked a prominent but slow EPSC, whose total charge was 63% of the HSS-triggered EPSC (Figures 1D and 1E). When compared to the flash-induced release in the absence of HSS (Figure 1A), the flash-induced release in the presence of HSS completely lacked the fast component. It showed much slower delay times (i.e., onset of release after flash) and rise times (delay time, 5.2 ± 0.7 ms; rise time, 95 ± 11 ms; Figure 1F) but had an identical decay time course (Figure 1G). Similarly, a high-frequency AP train applied after RRP depletion by HSS induced only slow release without a fast component (Figure S1D). The slower kinetics of release observed in the presence of HSS after RRP depletion are not due to adverse effects of the osmotic shock on the release machinery since Ca2+ uncaging in the presence of HSS, but before RRP depletion, induced SV fusion with very fast kinetics (Figure S1E). The experiments noted above show that after HSS-induced RRP depletion the elevation of [Ca2+]i by Ca2+ uncaging or by high-frequency stimuli can only induce additional “slow” release. The release triggered by Ca2+ uncaging thus consists of two release processes, a “fast” release that is selectively abolished by HSS application, and a slow release that is HSS insensitive. We subtracted the flash response obtained in the presence of HSS from the one obtained under normal conditions to estimate the HSS-sensitive component (Figure 1G). The kinetics of the slow component were calculated from independent experiments on WT neurons as run-down of synaptic responses usually prevented a systematic estimate of the kinetics of slow release from the same cells in which flash-evoked release was also assessed. These independent experiments were performed on cells with similar EPSC amplitudes, RRP sizes, and postuncaging Ca2+ levels as the ones in which flash-evoked responses were measured. In a set of cells, in which synaptic transmission after the first flash recovered to preflash levels, we were able to assess the slow release component from the same cell by applying a first flash followed by a second flash in the presence of HSS. The kinetics of the slow components obtained from independent experiments on different WT cells (Figure 1G) and from the same cells (delay time, 6.4 ± 0.74 ms, n = 7; rise time, 103.7 ± 19.52 ms, n = 7) did not differ and yielded similar results when a subtraction from total flash-evoked release was performed. The total charge of the isolated fast, HSS-sensitive component of the flash response matched the RRP size measured by HSS application in the same subset of neurons (HSS, 0.13 ± 0.23 nC; fast flash response, 0.10 ± 0.22 nC) (Figure 1H), indicating that the fast phase of the flash response reports total RRP release. To study the Ca2+ dependence of synaptic release and depletion of the RRP, we recorded EPSCs induced at varying flash intensities (Figures 1I–1K). We observed a striking [Ca2+]i dependence of the EPSCs and found that [Ca2+]i levels of ∼15-20 μM were sufficient to trigger maximal responses with regard to amplitude and kinetics of synchronous release (Figure 1I) and to RRP depletion (Figure 1J). We estimated peak release rates as a function of [Ca2+]i by deconvolution of flash evoked EPSCs using a measured miniature EPSC (mEPSC) waveform, and divided the corresponding values by the RRP size of the given cell to yield the peak release rate per SV (Figure 1K). A double-logarithmic plot of the latter values as a function of [Ca2+]i had a slope of ∼3 (Figure 1K), which is only slightly lower than corresponding data obtained in the calyx of Held (Young and Neher, 2009Young S.M. Neher E. Synaptotagmin has an essential function in synaptic vesicle positioning for synchronous release in addition to its role as a calcium sensor.Neuron. 2009; 63: 482-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, the threshold [Ca2+]i value at which release can be triggered in hippocampal autaptic neurons is slightly lower than corresponding values obtained in the calx of Held (Schneggenburger and Neher, 2000Schneggenburger R. Neher E. Intracellular calcium dependence of transmitter release rates at a fast central synapse.Nature. 2000; 406: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, Neher and Sakaba, 2008Neher E. Sakaba T. Multiple roles of calcium ions in the regulation of neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2008; 59: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). These differences likely arise from a slight underestimation of the actual [Ca2+]i at presynaptic terminals by measuring [Ca2+]i in distal dendrites because dendrites are compartmentalized and contain multiple Ca2+ buffers, but we cannot exclude that intrinsic differences exist between autaptic hippocampal neurons and the calyx of Held with regard to the [Ca2+]i dependence of transmitter release. In any case, our data show that [Ca2+]i levels of >20 μM, which we routinely triggered by Ca2+ uncaging, are sufficient to evoke maximal transmitter release in autaptic hippocampal neurons. Above findings show that rapid elevation of [Ca2+]i to >20 μM by Ca2+ uncaging induces the rapid discharge of the RRP within 200 ms and a much slower release process that decays with a slower time constant (τ = 1.34 s, n = 13). While this slower component might represent release from a “reluctantly” releasing SV pool, the fact that neither APs nor HSS triggered additional release after a Ca2+ uncaging stimulus (Figure 1A and Figure S1C) indicates that Ca2+ uncaging is sufficient to deplete all primed SVs in the autaptic preparation (see also Wadel et al., 2007Wadel K. Neher E. Sakaba T. The coupling between synaptic vesicles and Ca2+ channels determines fast neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2007; 53: 563-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Hence, the slow release phase observed by Ca2+ uncaging during HSS stimulation is most likely due to ongoing priming and fusion of incoming SVs and not to an already primed SV pool. Its time course can be explained by the initial release of the very small RRP that remains in the presence of HSS, followed by a strong Ca2+ dependent increase in SV priming, which determines the rising phase of the slow response, and the subsequent depletion of reserve SVs in the continued presence of high [Ca2+]i, which determines the decay kinetics of the slow response (Neher and Sakaba, 2008Neher E. Sakaba T. Multiple roles of calcium ions in the regulation of neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2008; 59: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Thus, the Ca2+ uncaging protocol allows to distinguish between the RRP itself, its replenishment by newly primed SVs, and the exhaustion of reserve SV pools. We next validated the Ca2+ uncaging protocol by examining two well characterized KO models, CAPS1/2 double KOs (CAPS-DKO) (Jockusch et al., 2007Jockusch W.J. Speidel D. Sigler A. Sorensen J.B. Varoqueaux F. Rhee J.S. Brose N. CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 are essential synaptic vesicle priming proteins.Cell. 2007; 131: 796-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and Syt-1-KOs (Geppert et al., 1994Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Sudhof T.C. Synaptotagmin I: A major Ca2+ sensor for transmitter release at a central synapse.Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). CAPS-DKO neurons are deficient in SV priming. Some 40% of CAPS-DKO neurons are “silent,” do not release any transmitter in response to single APs or HSS, and show only tonic release during high-frequency AP trains (Figure 2D ). This tonic release is also seen in WT cells, where it is superimposed with phasic AP-coupled release and attributed to a primed SV pool with a different Ca2+ sensitivity (Figure 2B) (Zucker and Lara-Estrella, 1983Zucker R.S. Lara-Estrella L.O. Post-tetanic decay of evoked and spontaneous transmitter release and a residual-calcium model of synaptic facilitation at crayfish neuromuscular junctions.J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To study the nature of tonic release, we applied the Ca2+ uncaging protocol to silent CAPS-DKO neurons. Ca2+ uncaging in CAPS-DKO cells induced only slow release (Figures 2A, 2C, 2E, and 2F). This slow release had similar kinetics as the slow release phase in WT neurons, and cumulative release had a similar single exponential time course (WT, τ = 1.34 s; CAPS-DKO, τ = 1.32 s; Figures S1F and S1G), indicating that the slow release observed in CAPS-DKO neurons upon Ca2+ uncaging and tonic release triggered by high-frequency AP trains originate from the continuous release of newly primed SVs and not from an already primed SV pool. Interestingly, the slow flash induced discharge of SVs in CAPS-DKO neurons was delayed by ∼180 ms as compared to Ctrl neurons (time to peak; Ctrl, 122 ms; CAPS-DKO 305 ms; Figures S1F and S1G), which is consistent with earlier data on calcimycin triggered release from CAPS-DKO cells (Jockusch et al., 2007Jockusch W.J. Speidel D. Sigler A. Sorensen J.B. Varoqueaux F. Rhee J.S. Brose N. CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 are essential synaptic vesicle priming proteins.Cell. 2007; 131: 796-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, 180 ms correspond to the average time required to build up newly primed SVs in CAPS-DKO synapses upon Ca2+ uncaging, which likely involves the Ca2+-dependent action of Munc13s (Jockusch et al., 2007Jockusch W.J. Speidel D. Sigler A. Sorensen J.B. Varoqueaux F. Rhee J.S. Brose N. CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 are essential synaptic vesicle priming proteins.Cell. 2007; 131: 796-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Shortly after a 40 Hz AP train silent CAPS-DKO neurons displayed phasic EPSCs, indicating that brief increases in [Ca2+]i can transiently restore and stabilize the RRP in these neurons (Figure 2D) (Jockusch et al., 2007Jockusch W.J. Speidel D. Sigler A. Sorensen J.B. Varoqueaux F. Rhee J.S. Brose N. CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 are essential synaptic vesicle priming proteins.Cell. 2007; 131: 796-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, Ca2+ uncaging after a 40 Hz AP train triggered a fast release phase in CAPS-DKO neurons, which showed similar kinetics as seen in WT cells (CAPS-DKO; delay time, 1.10 ± 0.07 ms; rise time, 1.02 ± 0.07 ms; n = 5), followed by slow release (Figure 2G). Size and kinetics of slow release from CAPS-DKO cells after a 40 Hz AP train were identical to those of resting CAPS-DKO cells (Figure 2H), supporting the notion that tonic release during high-frequency stimulation and slow release triggered by Ca2+ uncaging are due to the ongoing fusion of newly primed SVs. In the absence of the putative Ca2+ sensor Syt-1, hippocampal neurons display only asynchronous release in response to a single AP (Figure 3B ). To examine the Ca2+-sensor function of Syt-1 and to elucidate the nature of asynchronous release and its relationship with tonic release, we studied Syt-1-KO neurons using the Ca2+ uncaging protocol. Ca2+ uncaging elicited fast and slow release components in both Syt-1-KO and Ctrl neurons (Figures 3A and 3B). However, fast release was delayed in Syt-1-KO neurons (delay times; Ctrl, 0.98 ± 0.05 ms; Syt-1-KO, 2.63 ± 0.25 ms), and EPSC rise times were slower (Ctrl, 0.91 ± 0.14 ms; Syt-1-KO, 3.99 ± 0.38 ms) (Figures 3E–3G). To probe the Ca2+ dependence of release at Syt-1-KO synapses, we performed a titration of flash-evoked release as a function of [Ca2+]i by varying the levels of uncaged [Ca2+]i (Figures 3H and 3I). Syt-1-KO neurons showed a clear [Ca2+]i sensitivity of release, as indicated by the [Ca2+]i dependence of release kinetics and peak release rate per SV. However, compared to WT neurons (Figures 1I–1K), the Ca2+ sensitivity of release in Syt-1-KO neurons was drastically altered, as rise times and delay times were increased and the double-logarithmic plot of the peak release rate per SV as a function of [Ca2+]i had a reduced slope with higher release rates at low [Ca2+]i levels and lower release rates at higher [Ca2+]i levels (Figure 3H and 3I). These findings show that Syt-1 acts as a Ca2+ sensor of release in whose absence a more [Ca2+]i sensitive but less effective and as yet unidentified Ca2+ sensor is operational. The RRP size estimated by Ca2+ uncaging was not significantly reduced in Syt-1-KO cells (Ctrl, 0.069 ± 0.017 nC; Syt-1-KO, 0.052 ± 0.018 nC) (Figure 3C). While EPSC amplitudes were drastically reduced in Syt-1-KO neurons (Ctrl, 2.0 ± 0.17 nA, n = 39; Syt-1-KO, 0.19 ± 0.03 nA, n = 36), EPSC charges measured within 1 s after the APs were only reduced to ∼30% of control levels (Ctrl, 0.017 ± 0.0015 nC, n = 39; Syt-1-KO, 0.0054 ± 0.00049 nC, n = 36). Interestingly, the cumulative charge triggered by RRP release from Syt-1-KO cells upon Ca2+ uncaging still followed a double exponential time course (Figure 3D), and the time constants and relative contributions of the two phases were not statistically different from Ctrl values (Ctrl, τf = 7.8 ± 1.24 ms, 33%, τs = 43.0 ± 7.1 ms, 67%; Syt-1-KO, τf = 8.6 ± 1.1 ms, 43%, τs = 42.9 ± 5.2 ms, 57%). Thus, Syt-1-KO neurons exhibit the typical heterogeneity of primed SV pools, much like control cells. Previous studies indicated the existence of Syt-1-sensitive and Syt-1-insensitive primed SV pools, the latter of which was suggested to cause asynchronous and tonic transmitter release (Maximov and Sudhof, 2005Maximov A. Sudhof T.C. Autonomous function of synaptotagmin 1 in triggering synchronous release independent of asynchronous release.Neuron. 2005; 48: 547-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Our data show that even the slow release component measured by Ca2+ uncaging in the presence of HSS is delayed in Syt-1-KO cells (Ctrl, 4.2 ± 0.5 ms; Syt-1-KO, 9.9 ± 2.2 ms; Figure S1H). In view of this finding, which indicates that tonically released SVs are also sensitive to Syt-1 loss, and the fact that Syt-1-KO neurons have an RRP that is released quickly by Ca2+ uncaging, the asynchronous release triggered by single APs in Syt-1-KO neurons is most likely due to a change in Ca2+ sensing by a sensor other than Syt-1, rather than to a unique primed SV pool. α- and βSNAP are highly homologous to each other but distinct from the third SNAP family member, γSNAP (Clary et al., 1990Clary D.O.

https://openalex.org/W1986977142,"Polymeric immunoglobulin A (pIgA) transcytosis, mediated by the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), is a central component of mucosal immunity and a model for regulation of polarized epithelial membrane traffic. Binding of pIgA to pIgR stimulates transcytosis in a process requiring Yes, a Src family tyrosine kinase (SFK). We show that Yes directly phosphorylates EGF receptor (EGFR) on liver endosomes. Injection of pIgA into rats induced EGFR phosphorylation. Similarly, in MDCK cells, pIgA treatment significantly increased phosphorylation of EGFR on various sites, subsequently activating extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK). Furthermore, we find that the Rab11 effector Rab11-FIP5 is a substrate of ERK. Knocking down Yes or Rab11-FIP5, or inhibition of the Yes-EGFR-ERK cascade, decreased pIgA-pIgR transcytosis. Finally, we demonstrate that Rab11-FIP5 phosphorylation by ERK controls Rab11a endosome distribution and pIgA-pIgR transcytosis. Our results reveal a novel Yes-EGFR-ERK-FIP5 signalling network for regulation of pIgA-pIgR transcytosis."

Important structural similarities between the three protein families led to the initial hypothesis that pannexins form intercellular gap junctions. However, this concept has received little experimental support (3Zoidl G. Petrasch-Parwez E. Ray A. Meier C. Bunse S. Habbes H.W. Dahl G. Dermietzel R.

Opening of Panx1 channels has been induced by various experimental conditions, including activation of purinergic receptors, stretch, high intracellular calcium, and membrane depolarization (13Pelegrin P.

Panx1 channels lack sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+, an important property, as Panx1 channels are not excluded from opening under physiological ionic conditions, unlike most Cx hemichannels. In neurons and possibly astrocytes, Panx1 may contribute to novel forms of synaptic and nonsynaptic communication and Ca2+ wave propagation (16MacVicar B.A. Thompson R.J.

Furthermore, Panx1 activation is implicated in ischemic, excitotoxic, and ATP-dependent cell death, whereas Panx1 coupling with purinergic receptors triggers the inflammasome (18Silverman W.R. de Rivero Vaccari J.P.

Several studies have shown that cardiac myocytes from different species express a large conductance channel (LCC) with unknown physiological function (22Pott L. Mechmann S. J. Membr.

This channel responds to spontaneous or caffeine-induced Ca2+ release from internal stores and has the paradoxical feature that unitary current fluctuations can be resolved in the whole cell mode of the patch clamp technique, suggesting a very low density of functional channels. Previous attempts to identify the molecular identity of LCC, primarily based on pharmacological tools with limited specificity, were not conclusive. Interpretations as to its molecular nature included Cx hemichannels (22Pott L. Mechmann S. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 117: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), ryanodine receptors (23Kondo R.P. Weiss J.N. Goldhaber J.I.

Res. 2003; 58: 76-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). LCC activities investigated in the quoted studies share some common features beyond their large conductance as follows: they are nonselective cation channels, they can be activated by Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, particularly when synchronized by caffeine; and they appear to have a low density in the plasma membrane or a low open probability. Here, we demonstrate that the LCC, activated by Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac myocytes, shares key pharmacological properties previously used for identifying and characterizing Panx1 channels. These data are in support of the notion that Panx1 constitutes this LCC. Beyond the pharmacological analogies, we can demonstrate that Panx1 protein and LCC are lost within 4–5 days in vitro but can be rescued by adenoviral gene transfer of Panx1. Because sporadic openings of single Panx1 channels in the absence of caffeine can trigger action potentials, we suggest that Panx1 channels potentially promote arrhythmogenic activities. Experiments were performed in accordance with local ethics committee approval. Wistar-Kyoto rats of either sex (weight around 200 g) were anesthetized by intravenous injection of urethane (1g/kg). The chest was opened, and the heart was removed and mounted on the cannula of a Langendorff perfusion system for coronary perfusion at a constant flow. The method of enzymatic isolation of atrial myocytes has been described in detail previously (26Bechem M. Pott L. Rennebaum H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 31: 366-36929PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a low density (several hundred cells per dish) and cultured in fetal calf serum-free medium (M199, Invitrogen) containing 25 μg/ml gentamycin (Sigma) and 25 μg/ml kanamycin (Sigma). Medium was changed every 2nd day. Myocytes were used experimentally from day 1 until day 6 after isolation. The pAd-Easy-1 plasmid encoding for the adenovirus type 5 and pAd-Track-CMV were kindly provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore). A recombinant adenovirus was generated by subcloning the full-length mouse Panx1 coding sequence (amino acids 1–426; GI:86262134) into the pAd-Track-CMV shuttle vector to yield pAd-Panx1. The construct was sequence-verified. Generation of recombinant adenovirus encoding either for Panx1 and GFP or GFP only (mock control) was performed as described in detail previously (27He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). Briefly, adenoviral recombinant plasmids were generated by homologous recombination between pAd-Panx1 and pAd-Easy-1 in Escherichia coli. Recombinant viruses (Ad-Panx1) were propagated in HEK 293 cells and recovered after several freezing-thawing cycles. Virus titers were determined by serial dilution and infection of myocyte cultures. For infection, cells were incubated with 1 ml of culture medium containing 105 infectious particles (gene transforming units). Total RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed, and used in real time PCR as described previously (8Ray A. Zoidl G. Weickert S. Wahle P. Dermietzel R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 3277-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The primer pairs were as follows: Panx1 sense (5′-tgttctggcgctttgcggcggc-3′), Panx1 antisense (5′-ggtccaggtccatctctcagg-3′); 18 S sense (5′-catggtgaccacgggtgac-3′) and 18 S antisense (5′-ttccttggatgtggtagccg-3′) designed for rat Panx1 and 18 S rRNA amplification using VectorNTI software (Invitrogen). Amplification reactions were performed in triplicate using SYBR Green I reaction conditions as recommended by the manufacturer (Clontech) using the DNA Engine Opticon 2 real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The Ct values for the reference gene (18 S rRNA) were used to normalize mRNA levels of the samples. The changes of Panx1 mRNA expression levels were calculated as ratios relative to the Panx1 mRNA levels found in isolated newborn rat hippocampal neurons cultivated for 7 days (set to 1). All experiments represented three independent sets of samples analyzed in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using the relative expression software tool (REST) software (28Pfaffl M.W. Horgan G.W. Dempfle L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, total protein extracts from tissues of adult rats were isolated by direct homogenization in denaturing Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Protran BA83, Schleicher & Schüll), and processed as described previously (3Zoidl G. Petrasch-Parwez E. Ray A. Meier C. Bunse S. Habbes H.W. Dahl G. Dermietzel R. Neuroscience. 2007; 146: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were diluted 1:1,000 (chi-Panx1, gift by Dr. G. Dahl, Miami, FL (12Thompson R.J. Zhou N. MacVicar B.A. Science. 2006; 312: 924-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar)) and 1:15,000 (anti-GAPDH; Sigma). Secondary antibodies were IRDye680- (1:15,000) and IRDye800-coupled (1:20,000), and Western blot detection was performed using the Odyssey® infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). Sections (10 μm) from adult heart tissue of transcardially perfused rats (4% paraformaldehyde) were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked for 1 h with 3% normal horse serum, 1% BSA in PBS, pH 7.4. Isolated adult rat myocytes cultured on 35-mm μ-dishes (ibidi) were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked for 1 h with 3% normal horse serum, 1% BSA in PBS, pH 7.4. The chicken anti-Panx1 antibody was diluted 1:100. Secondary antibodies were Alexa 488 nm or Alexa 563 nm coupled (1:3,000). Specimen were finally stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) and mounted with Prolong Antifade Gold (Invitrogen). Confocal image analysis was performed using the LSM 510 meta system (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH,), equipped with argon and HeNe lasers, 63× (NA 1.4) oil objectives, and the LSM 510 META software as described previously (3Zoidl G. Petrasch-Parwez E. Ray A. Meier C. Bunse S. Habbes H.W. Dahl G. Dermietzel R. Neuroscience. 2007; 146: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For the patch clamp measurements, an extracellular solution of the following composition was used (in mm): 132 NaCl, 7 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, pH 7.4. The solution for filling the patch clamp pipettes contained (in mm) 65 Cs3citrate, 10 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 4 Na2ATP, 200 μm EGTA, pH 7.3. For investigating mechanosensitivity of single channel currents, cardiac myocytes were immersed in isotonic solution (composed of (in mm) the following: 100 NaCl, 30 mannitol, 1 MgCl2, 5 CaCl2, 7 CsCl, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, 300 mosmol/kg) and then in a hypotonic solution of the same composition, except that mannitol was omitted (∼270 mosmol/kg). For current clamp experiments the following solutions were used (in mm) were as follows: 132 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, pH 7.4. The patch pipette contained 100 potassium aspartate, 40 KCl, 5 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 EGTA, 20 HEPES, 0.025 Na2GTP, 5 Na2ATP, pH 7.3. Standard chemicals were from Merck. EGTA, HEPES, Na2ATP, 2-methylthioadenosine-5′-triphosphate (2Mes-ATP), Na2GTP, probenecid, carbenoxolone (CBX), and caffeine were from Sigma. Membrane currents were recorded using whole cell patch clamp. The DC resistance of the filled pipettes ranged from 4 to 6 megohms. Current measurements were performed with a patch clamp amplifier (List LM/EPC 7). Signals were analog-filtered (1 kHz), digitally sampled, and stored on a computer equipped with a hardware/software package (Iso2, MFK) for voltage control, data acquisition, and analysis. Experiments were performed at ambient temperature (22–24 °C). Membrane holding potential was −60 mV. Rapid superfusion of the cells for application and withdrawal of different solutions was performed by a custom-made solenoid-operated flow system that permitted switching between different solutions within less than 100 ms. Recordings of membrane potential were performed in the current clamp mode. Channel activity was expressed as nPo (i.e. number of channels multiplied by the individual channel open probability) from recordings that were at least 10 s in duration (during caffeine application) or 40 s in duration for with spontaneous LCC activity. For single channel current measurements, the paired t test was used to compare the means of LCC activity before and during drug application. Independent t test was used for evaluating the means of two different groups (e.g. nPo of LCCs in atrial cells measured on days 2 and 5). Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. In isolated rat myocytes, experimental conditions using citrate as a low affinity Ca2+ buffer favor spontaneous cyclic Ca2+ release, which activates an inward current carried by electrogenic Na+/Ca2+ exchange (NCX) (29Mechmann S. Pott L. Nature. 1986; 319: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The NCX current was superimposed by single channel current fluctuations with an amplitude of ∼15 pA at holding potential (Fig. 1A). Rapid exposure to caffeine, a common tool to discharge Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by opening of the ryanodine-receptor release channels (30Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. 1975; 249: 497-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), caused an increased and prolonged channel activity. In the recording shown, which was from a myocyte in culture for about 20 h, upon exposure to caffeine a maximum of four simultaneous openings was identified. In general, channel activity slowly decayed in the continuous presence of caffeine; as a rule, channel openings could be recorded for up to 10 min. Because experiments were facilitated by firm attachment of the myocytes, most measurements were performed after at least 24 h in vitro. In line with previous studies, LCC was not induced by short term culture but could be recorded also in freshly isolated atrial and ventricular myocytes, as shown in supplemental Fig. S1, A and B. Inhibition of caffeine-induced Ca2+ release using the local anesthetic tetracaine (1 mm), a common tool to block the ryanodine receptor release channel, abolished both the NCX current and LCC activity, as illustrated in supplemental Fig. S2. This clearly supports the notion that LCC is activated by caffeine-induced Ca2+ release rather than by caffeine itself (25Zhang Y.A. Tuft R.A. Lifshitz L.M. Fogarty K.E. Singer J.J. Zou H. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 293: H2448-H2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In line with previous studies, the unitary conductance of the LCC was determined as 298 ± 14 picosiemens (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1, B and D, activity of the channel was almost completely lost after 5 days in vitro, whereas spontaneous Ca2+ cycling and NCX current were not different from short term (48 h) cultured atrial myocytes. Expression of Panx1 has been previously demonstrated in the mouse heart and in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes on the transcriptional level (8Ray A. Zoidl G. Weickert S. Wahle P. Dermietzel R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 3277-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 38Nishida M. Sato Y. Uemura A. Narita Y. Tozaki-Saitoh H. Nakaya M. Ide T. Suzuki K. Inoue K. Nagao T. Kurose H.

Quantitative mRNA PCR analysis demonstrated that isolated rat atrial myocytes express Panx1 mRNA at levels comparable with isolated newborn hippocampal neurons or adult brain but at higher levels than in heart tissue (Fig. 2A). Western blots confirmed the presence of the differentially glycosylated Panx1 (GLY0–2; see Refs. 31Boassa D. Ambrosi C. Qiu F. Dahl G. Gaietta G. Sosinsky G. J. Biol.

Confocal imaging of isolated atrial and ventricular myocytes reveals a preferential localization to the surface membrane (Fig. 2D). In accordance with previous publications (26Bechem M. Pott L. Rennebaum H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 31: 366-36929PubMed Google Scholar, 29Mechmann S. Pott L. Nature. 1986; 319: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), adult atrial myocytes but not ventricular myocytes undergo a morphological change from spindle-shaped to spherical within several hours after isolation (supplemental Fig. S1C). Most importantly, in cultured cardiac myocytes Panx1 protein expression recapitulates the pattern observed for LCC activity. Panx1 is abundantly expressed on day 2 and lost by day 5 in vitro (Fig. 2E). Expression and localization of Panx1 in the heart and the parallel loss in expression of Panx1 (Fig. 2D) and LCC activity in isolated myocytes (Fig. 1) led us hypothesize that the large unitary current events were carried by Panx1. To challenge this hypothesis, myocytes were infected with Ad-Panx1 about 16 h after plating. Caffeine-induced channel activity was measured on day 5 in vitro and quantified as nPo for periods of 10 s starting at the peak of the NCX current. As illustrated in Fig. 3, in contrast to time-matched native or mock-infected myocytes, LCC activity in terms of nPo was not significantly different from short term (48 h) cultured myocytes, i.e. LCC activity was rescued by expression of Panx1 (compare Figs. 1D and 3B), demonstrating a direct link between Panx1 expression and LCC activity. Although to date highly selective inhibitors of Panx1 channels are not available, two compounds are suitable to distinguish Panx1-related currents from other charge-carrying mechanisms such as Cx hemichannels. Panx1 channels are sensitive to carbenoxolone, a naturally occurring 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor, commonly used as gap junction inhibitor (34Goldberg G.S. Moreno A.P. Bechberger J.F. Hearn S.S. Shivers R.R. MacPhee D.J. Zhang Y.C. Naus C.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Figs. 3C and 4, A and C, 20 μm CBX, a concentration that does not significantly affect Cx-related current (35Bruzzone R. Barbe M.T. Jakob N.J. Monyer H. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), reduced caffeine-induced channel activity in Ad-Panx1-infected and native atrial myocytes. Cyclic Ca2+ release and the resulting NCX current were not affected by this compound. Probenecid, a drug for the treatment of gout by virtue of its inhibitory effect on organic anion transporters (36Shitara Y. Sato H. Sugiyama Y. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 689-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), inhibits Panx1 without affecting Cx channels at concentrations up to 1 mm (37Silverman W. Locovei S. Dahl G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C761-C767Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Application of 200 μm probenecid on Ad-Panx1-infected atrial myocytes substantially reduced nPo of the caffeine-induced LCC activity, consistent with the effective concentration for inhibition of Panx1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 3C) (37Silverman W. Locovei S. Dahl G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C761-C767Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). An analogous pharmacological profile was observed for LCCs in native atrial myocytes cultured for 2 days. Under these conditions, caffeine-induced LCCs were inhibited by 200 μm probenecid (Fig. 4, B and D) by about 50% on average. Thus, both exogenously expressed channels related to Panx1 and endogenous LCC activity display analogous pharmacological properties. Evidence has been provided that Panx1 is involved in the release of ATP and UTP from cardiac myocytes under conditions of pressure overload (38Nishida M. Sato Y. Uemura A. Narita Y. Tozaki-Saitoh H. Nakaya M. Ide T. Suzuki K. Inoue K. Nagao T. Kurose H. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 3104-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). More recently, a complex of Panx1 and P2X7 receptors has been suggested to be responsible for the release of cardioprotectants induced by ischemic pre- and postconditioning (39Vessey D.A. Li L. Kelley M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. Ther. 2010; 15: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Evidence for a role of Panx1 as ATP-release channel, which is modulated by ATP via P2X and P2Y receptors, has been provided in different cellular systems (10Iglesias R. Dahl G. Qiu F. Spray D.C. Scemes E. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7092-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 11Locovei S. Bao L. Dahl G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Bustamante M. Casas M. López J. Riquelme M. Sáez J.C. Huidobro-Toro J.P. Jaimovich E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 34490-34505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a direct inhibition of Panx1 channels by extracellular ATP at concentrations in the millimolar range (up to 10 mm) has been demonstrated (41Ma W. Hui H. Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2009; 328: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 42Qiu F. Dahl G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 296: C250-C255Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), suggesting a self-regulatory feedback mechanism of channel activity. Therefore, we hypothesized that extracellular ATP might affect gating of LCC in cardiac myocytes via purinergic P2 receptors. This notion is supported by two facts as follows: (i) purinergic P2X and P2Y receptors are expressed in various regions of the rat heart, including atria and sinoatrial node (43Musa H. Tellez J.O. Chandler N.J. Greener I.D. Maczewski M. Mackiewicz U. Beresewicz A. Molenaar P. Boyett M.R. Dobrzynski H. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2009; 379: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and (ii) extracellular ATP is known to promote (patho)physiological functional changes in cardiac cells by stimulation of P2 purinoceptors, including induction of arrhythmic activity through activation of depolarizing membrane currents (44Gurung I.S. Kalin A. Grace A.A. Huang C.L. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2009; 47: 622-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Sporadic LCC openings with identical conductance as caffeine-induced LCC in native atrial myocytes could be identified in the absence of caffeine or cyclic Ca2+ release with a very low open probability (Fig. 5A). Extracellular application of 200 μm ATP gradually increased LCC activity (Fig. 5, A and C). Channel activity remained elevated in the presence of ATP and decreased within 1–3 min after removal of the purinergic agonist. The increase in LCC by ATP was sensitive to probenecid, as shown in supplemental Fig. S3. Modulation of LCC activity might reflect ATP-induced activation of P2Y receptors and subsequent inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. In line with this hypothesis, exposure to ATP caused a small but consistent inward shift of holding current. Presumably this reflects NCX. A clear identification of the charge-carrying mechanism, however, was impeded because of the low density of this current. Activation of LCC by ATP could be mimicked by 2Mes-ATP (10 μm), a P2X/P2Y1 agonist (Fig. 6). Consistent with a feedback inhibition of Panx1 channels suggested previously (37Silverman W. Locovei S. Dahl G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C761-C767Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), ATP at higher concentrations (2 mm) suppressed spontaneous LCC activity in atrial myocytes (Fig. 5, B and D).FIGURE 6Increase of LCC activity through activation of purinergic receptors by 10 μm 2Mes-ATP. A, recording of spontaneous LCC activity in atrial myocyte (2 days in culture) without caffeine. Application of the P2X and P2Y1 agonist 2Mes-ATP reversibly increased LCC openings. Channel activity increased after a short delay of about 30 s and slowly decreased after removal of the agonist within 60 s. B, summarized nPo (n = 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The open state probability of Panx1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes has been shown to be sensitive to stretch (15Bao L. Locovei S. Dahl G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Here, we induced mechanical strain by exposure of atrial cells to hypotonic solution causing cell swelling. Spontaneous LCC activity was recorded in an isotonic bath solution (300 mosmol/kg) (Fig. 7A), before switching to a hypotonic solution (270 mosmol/kg). Cells were allowed to stabilize in the hypotonic solution before channel activity was recorded again. Under these conditions, single channel activity gradually increased during the adaptation time and remained elevated in the presence of the hypotonic solution (Fig. 7B). Analogously, channels in Ad-Panx1-infected atrial cells (day 5) responded to hypotonic cell swelling with increased opening activity (Fig. 7C). Inward current through single LCCs in an intact cell gives rise to a depolarization, which might reach threshold for eliciting an action potential, as shown previously (25Zhang Y.A. Tuft R.A. Lifshitz L.M. Fogarty K.E. Singer J.J. Zou H. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 293: H2448-H2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In a fraction of about 70% of myocytes studied using a physiological K+ gradient ([K+]o = 5.4 mm) in whole cell recordings at high gain, we observed LCC openings without caffeine or a purinergic agonist with very low probability. Representative examples are illustrated in Fig. 8. Spontaneous irregular action potentials or action potential-like electrical activity were detected under this condition in both native (A–C) and Ad-panx1-infected myocytes (D and E). As shown on the expanded time scale (Fig. 8C), these action potentials were preceded by a slight depolarization that activated voltage-gated sodium channels resulting in a fast action potential upstroke. As one would expect, inhibition of spontaneous LCC activity by probenecid resulted in electrical quiescence under current clamp conditions (Fig. 8, D and E). This study provides substantial evidence that Panx1 represents the molecular equivalent of the large conductance cation channel first described more than 20 years ago (29Mechmann S. Pott L. Nature. 1986; 319: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The major finding is the full reconstitution of spontaneous and/or caffeine-induced LCC activity in 5-day cultured atrial myocytes by adenovirus-driven expression of Panx1. In contrast to Ad-Panx1-infected myocytes, time-matched native or empty virus-infected cells revealed negligible channel activity. The loss in LCC activity was paralleled by a loss in Panx1 immunoreactivity. Previous studies related cardiac LCC to polycystin-2-like channels (24Volk T. Schwoerer A.P. Thiessen S. Schultz J.H. Ehmke H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 58: 76-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), ryanodine receptors (23Kondo R.P. Weiss J.N. Goldhaber J.I. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 440: 125-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or Cx hemichannels (22Pott L. Mechmann S. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 117: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The inconsistent interpretations of the molecular nature of LCCs were solely based upon the pharmacological profile of channel inhibition, e.g. by tetracaine, ruthenium red, amiloride, or octanol. Although the channel specificity of CBX is rather low, it inhibits Panx1 channels at concentrations 5–20-fold less than required for inhibition of connexin hemichannels (37Silverman W. Locovei S. Dahl G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C761-C767Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Thus, 20 μm CBX used in this study acts on Panx1 rather than gap junctional channels. Probenecid inhibits current carried Panx1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes with an IC50 of 150 μm (37Silverman W. Locovei S. Dahl G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C761-C767Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In identical experimental conditions, this compound at a concentration of 5 mm did not affect currents carried by different connexin channels. In our experiments 200 μm probenecid caused substantial inhibition of LCC activity in native and Ad-Panx1-infected myocytes, which excludes connexins as conductance pathways of LCC currents. The spontaneous openings of LCCs at physiological extracellular Ca2+ concentrations further argue against connexin channels being the molecular LCC correlate, because connexons should be closed at physiological Ca2+ concentrations of 1–2 mm. The bidirectional modulation of LCCs by extracellular ATP, activation by submillimolar concentrations, and inhibition by millimolar concentrations appears to be another characteristic feature of Panx1 channels (41Ma W. Hui H. Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2009; 328: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 42Qiu F. Dahl G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 296: C250-C255Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), supporting our interpretation of Panx1 protein forming the cardiac LC channel. The modulation of LCC activity by extracellular ATP and membrane stretch and its sporadic spontaneous activity imply a considerable significance for cardiac (patho)physiology. Locally released ATP may affect cardiac excitability via activation of metabotropic purinergic receptors and subsequent openings of Panx1 channels. This notion is supported by the observation that in the mouse heart stretch-induced ATP release through Panx1 activates P2Y6 receptors in an auto-/paracrine way. This stimulates the heterotrimeric G12 family protein Gα12/13, which is suggested to trigger fibrosis via Rho activation under conditions of pressure overload (38Nishida M. Sato Y. Uemura A. Narita Y. Tozaki-Saitoh H. Nakaya M. Ide T. Suzuki K. Inoue K. Nagao T. Kurose H. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 3104-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The same study demonstrated that stretch-induced ATP release from neonatal cardiac myocytes was substantially reduced by siRNA targeting Panx1, confirming Panx1 channels as a major ATP-release pathway. Likewise, Panx1 was described to mediate the release of cardioprotectants induced by ischemic pre- and post-conditioning (39Vessey D.A. Li L. Kelley M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. Ther. 2010; 15: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Brief cycles of ischemia/reperfusion are supposed to induce the formation of Panx1-P2X7 complexes with concomitant release of ATP. Openings of LCC in rat cardiac myocytes are accompanied by Ca2+ influx and membrane depolarizations, which can trigger action potentials (25Zhang Y.A. Tuft R.A. Lifshitz L.M. Fogarty K.E. Singer J.J. Zou H. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 293: H2448-H2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the intact tissue, depolarizations resulting from brief spontaneous openings are likely to be dampened by the three-dimensional cable properties of the myocardial electrical syncytium. However, spontaneous LCC openings mediated by Panx1 might be potentially arrhythmogenic under certain pathological conditions that cause an increased opening activity or Panx1 expression (38Nishida M. Sato Y. Uemura A. Narita Y. Tozaki-Saitoh H. Nakaya M. Ide T. Suzuki K. Inoue K. Nagao T. Kurose H. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 3104-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) analogous to the involvement of Panx1 channels in the generation of aberrant bursting in the hippocampus, as described recently (17Thompson R.J. Jackson M.F. Olah M.E. Rungta R.L. Hines D.J. Beazely M.A. MacDonald J.F. MacVicar B.A. Science. 2008; 322: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We thank Drs. E.

https://openalex.org/W1665357608,"Thrombin is a potent modulator of endothelial function and, through stimulation of NF-κB, induces endothelial expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). These cell surface adhesion molecules recruit inflammatory cells to the vessel wall and thereby participate in the development of atherosclerosis, which is increasingly recognized as an inflammatory condition. The principal receptor for thrombin on endothelial cells is protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Although it is known that PAR-1 signaling to NF-κB depends on initial PKC activation, the subsequent steps leading to stimulation of the canonical NF-κB machinery have remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a complex of proteins containing CARMA3, Bcl10, and MALT1 links PAR-1 activation to stimulation of the IκB kinase complex. IκB kinase in turn phosphorylates IκB, leading to its degradation and the release of active NF-κB. Further, we find that although this CARMA3·Bcl10·MALT1 signalosome shares features with a CARMA1-containing signalosome found in lymphocytes, there are significant differences in how the signalosomes communicate with their cognate receptors. Specifically, whereas the CARMA1-containing lymphocyte complex relies on 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 for assembly and activation, the CARMA3-containing endothelial signalosome functions completely independent of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 and instead relies on β-arrestin 2 for assembly. Finally, we show that thrombin-dependent adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells requires an intact endothelial CARMA3·Bcl10·MALT1 signalosome, underscoring the importance of the signalosome in mediating one of the most significant pro-atherogenic effects of thrombin.

IntroductionThrombin is a serine protease produced during intravascular coagulation, typically as a consequence of vascular injury (1.Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). Although thrombin plays a central role in furthering the coagulation cascade by cleaving fibrinogen to produce fibrin, it also possesses the ability to act like a traditional hormone and elicit responses in a variety of cell types, including circulating platelets and endothelial cells (1.Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). These cellular responses are mediated by a small family of GPCRs 3The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorICAM-1intracellular adhesion molecule-1VCAM-1vascular cell adhesion molecule-1PARprotease activated receptorCARMACARD-containing MAGUK proteinMALTmucosa associated lymphoid tissueCBMCARMA-Bcl10-MALT1IKKIκB kinasePDK1phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1CARDcaspase recruitment domainEGFREGF receptorLPAlysophosphatidic acidMEFmouse embryonic fibroblast. that are activated by thrombin through an unusual mechanism. Specifically, thrombin-dependent cleavage removes the N-terminal sequence of a target receptor, unmasking a cryptic peptide ligand that is present within the extracellular domain of the receptor itself. This tethered ligand is then able to interact with the ligand-binding pocket of the receptor to stimulate intracellular signaling (1.Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). As a result, the receptors that are activated in this manner have been termed protease-activated receptors, or PARs. Currently, four members of the family have been identified, PAR-1 through PAR-4, although not all are directly acted upon by thrombin and instead represent targets of other proteases such as trypsin (2.Minami T. Sugiyama A. Wu S.Q. Abid R. Kodama T. Aird W.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 3.Major C.D. Santulli R.J. Derian C.K. Andrade-Gordon P.

Haemost. 2008; 99: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Because thrombin is short-lived in the circulation, most of its effects are exerted locally, near its site of generation. Consequently, endothelial cells adjacent to a site of tissue injury and coagulation represent a particularly important target of thrombin action. The predominant receptor for thrombin on endothelial cells appears to be PAR-1 (6.O'Brien P.J. Prevost N. Molino M. Hollinger M.K. Woolkalis M.J. Woulfe D.S. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13502-13509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and although many specific endothelial responses follow stimulation of PAR-1, most can be characterized as contributing to “endothelial dysfunction” (7.Croce K. Libby P. Curr. Opin Hematol. 2007; 14: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 8.Borissoff J.I. Spronk H.M. Heeneman S. ten Cate H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2009; 82: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This is defined as a breakdown in the ability of the endothelium to maintain appropriate vascular tone, permeability, metabolism, and production of biologically active substances (9.Le Brocq M. Leslie S.J. Milliken P. Megson I.L. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 1631-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Central to the phenomenon of endothelial dysfunction is the expression of adhesion molecules for recruitment of inflammatory cells and the production of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. All of these effects are key to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, in which early vascular injury caused by cholesterol deposition leads to thrombin-induced inflammation and propagation of vessel damage.Activation of the NF-κB transcription factor represents one of the foremost mechanisms responsible for thrombin-induced endothelial dysfunction. As for many activators of NF-κB, this occurs through the so-called canonical pathway, whereby activation depends upon stimulation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex (10.Fazal F. Bijli K.M.

IKK in turn directs the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB, a protein that sequesters NF-κB (particularly in the form of RelA/p65) in the cytoplasm (20.Ghosh S. Hayden M.S. Nat. Rev.

Upon IκB degradation, NF-κB is then free to translocate to the nucleus and stimulate transcription of various pro-inflammatory genes.Although considerable work has been carried out to demonstrate that thrombin induction of the canonical NF-κB pathway in endothelial cells requires prior stimulation of PKCδ (2.Minami T.

Much of our understanding of the complex, now referred to as the CBM signalosome, comes from earlier work in lymphocytes where an analogous signalosome containing the related CARMA1 protein mediates NF-κB activation downstream of the antigen receptor (34.Blonska M. Lin X. Immunol. Rev. 2009; 228: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 35.Rawlings D.J. Sommer K. Moreno-García M.E. Nat. Rev.

STKE. 2007; 2007: pe21Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the case of lymphocytes, antigen stimulation leads to activation of PKC, which in turn phosphorylates CARMA1, causing a conformational change that exposes the CARMA1 caspase recruitment domain (CARD), a region responsible for binding Bcl10 (38.Matsumoto R.

MALT1 is then recruited, and the intact signalosome interacts with and stimulates the IKK complex.Because thrombin-dependent NF-κB activation clearly requires PKC activation as an upstream event, we asked whether the CBM signalosome might function as an integral component of the thrombin-responsive signaling machinery. Here we show that all three proteins, CARMA3, Bcl10, and MALT1, are essential for thrombin to effectively stimulate the canonical NF-κB pathway in endothelial cells. Importantly, we also show that disrupting the CBM signalosome in endothelial cells has important pathophysiologic consequences, because it effectively blocks the ability of thrombin to induce expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 and reduces the thrombin-dependent adhesion of monocytes to these endothelial cells. As such, the thrombin receptor now joins a small number of GPCRs that utilize the CBM signalosome to signal to NF-κB. Several of these GPCRs share the property of causing endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation in the context of atherosclerosis. As a result, the CBM signalosome can be seen as an increasingly attractive target for pharmaceutical intervention in our attempts to combat multiple common instigators of atherogenesis.DISCUSSIONThrombin is now well recognized for exerting pro-inflammatory effects on the vasculature, particularly through its actions on endothelial cells. Whereas many of these effects are mediated by activation of the NF-κB transcription factor and downstream induction of NF-κB-responsive genes, the mechanisms linking thrombin receptors to the canonical NF-κB machinery are incompletely understood. In this study, we show that a signaling complex composed of the CARMA3, Bcl10, and MALT1 proteins (CBM signalosome) serves as a molecular bridge to link activated thrombin receptors to the IκB kinase. Further, we demonstrate that the CBM signalosome is essential for thrombin to activate transcription of key genes that underlie the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, particularly those that mediate recruitment of inflammatory cells to the vessel wall.To date, a select group of GPCRs have now been shown to utilize the CBM signalosome for activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway. In addition to the thrombin receptor (PAR-1), these GPCRs include the receptors for angiotensin II, LPA, endothelin-1, platelet activating factor, IL-8 (CXCL8), and SDF-1 (CXCL12) (25.Grabiner B.C.

PAR-1 is unique among these GPCRs in that it is not activated by a circulating ligand. Rather, PAR-1 utilizes a tethered ligand that is present within the extracellular domain of the receptor itself but is masked by an N-terminal sequence that can be removed via proteolytic cleavage by thrombin (1.Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). Once the N-terminal sequence is removed, the tethered ligand is free to interact with the ligand-binding pocket of the receptor and activate downstream signaling. Many other differences exist between these receptors, including their preferences for coupling to specific G protein families including Gαi, Gαq, and Gα12/13 (54.Ye R.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 839-848PubMed Google Scholar, 55.Hendriks-Balk M.C. Peters S.L. Michel M.C. Alewijnse A.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 585: 278-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Despite their differences, GPCRs in this group do share some common properties. In particular, all are capable of activating PKC isoforms through Gαq (54.Ye R.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 839-848PubMed Google Scholar, 55.Hendriks-Balk M.C. Peters S.L. Michel M.C. Alewijnse A.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 585: 278-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We speculate that the PKC isoforms activated by these receptors phosphorylate CARMA3, thereby exposing the CARMA3 CARD and allowing for CARD-dependent recruitment of Bcl10 and MALT1. As such, this mechanism for assembly of the CBM signalosome would be analogous to that which occurs in B- and T-lymphocytes, following stimulation of antigen receptor (34.Blonska M. Lin X. Immunol. Rev. 2009; 228: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 35.Rawlings D.J. Sommer K. Moreno-García M.E. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 799-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 36.Thome M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 348-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 37.Wegener E. Krappmann D. Sci. STKE. 2007; 2007: pe21Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Clearly, however, many GPCRs are capable of activating PKC, but not all of these GPCRs are effective at stimulating NF-κB, and perhaps even fewer will be found to utilize the CBM signalosome. What are the distinguishing features that identify the group of GPCRs that effectively communicate with the CBM signalosome? The answer to this question is completely unknown but may lie in discovering additional signaling intermediates, besides PKC, that bridge selected GPCRs with the CBM signalosome. To gain further insight, we looked for clues by studying the well characterized activation of the analogous CARMA1-containing CBM signalosome in lymphocytes. In T-cells, strong evidence implicates PDK1 as a scaffolding protein that brings together activated PKC and CARMA1 following CD3/CD28 stimulation (48.Lee K.Y. D'Acquisto F. Hayden M.S. Shim J.H. Ghosh S. Science. 2005; 308: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 49.Park S.G. Schulze-Luehrman J. Hayden M.S. Hashimoto N. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Ghosh S. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 50.Häcker H. Karin M. Sci. STKE. 2006; 2006: re13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). In this case, stimulation of CD3 activates PKCθ, whereas stimulation of the CD28 co-receptor activates PI3K and induces PDK1 membrane recruitment (Fig. 7). PDK1 then binds to both PKC and CARMA1, facilitating the ability of PKC to recognize CARMA1 as a substrate and induce its phosphorylation.Importantly, PAR-1 is known to activate PI3K in addition to PKC (1.Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). Thus, we wondered whether this single receptor might be capable of activating two separate signal transduction pathways that converge on CARMA3, a feat that in the lymphocyte requires stimulation of two distinct receptors, CD3 and CD28 (Fig. 7). We therefore tested whether PI3K and PDK1 might be similarly important for the ability of PAR-1 to communicate with the CARMA3-containing CBM signalosome. As such, this could represent an additional level of control and potentially provide insight into the mechanisms governing the use of the CBM signalosome by only selected GPCRs.However, despite evidence suggesting that a physical interaction can occur between PDK1 and CARMA3, we found that PDK1 knockdown by RNA interference had absolutely no impact on the thrombin-dependent NF-κB response, nor did expression of a PDK1 dominant negative mutant. PI3K inhibitors were also largely ineffective at blocking thrombin-induced p-IκB generation and p65 nuclear translocation. These results suggest that a significant difference exists between the mechanism utilized by PAR-1 for communication with the CARMA3-containing CBM signalosome and that utilized by CD3/CD28 for communication with the CARMA1-containing CBM signalosome.It is intriguing to speculate that the difference may extend to multiple GPCRs, besides PAR-1. In fact, recent work by Sun and Lin (51.Sun J. Lin X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17085-17090Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) provides an alternative explanation as to how GPCRs may communicate with the CBM signalosome. These researchers demonstrated that MEFs from β-arrestin 2 knock-out mice were unable to respond to LPA with phosphorylation of IκB. In addition, β-arrestin 2 was found not only to bind CARMA3 but also to mediate an indirect physical interaction between the LPA receptor and CARMA3. Thus, β-arrestin 2 is an essential mediator of LPA-induced NF-κB activation. We similarly found that thrombin induction of p-IκB is completely impaired in β-arrestin 2 knock-out MEFs, whereas wild-type MEFs maintain a robust response. The arrestins are a small family of proteins known for their complex roles in GPCR signaling, and although some family members function only in the retina, two others, β-arrestin 1 and 2, are expressed ubiquitously and impact GPCR-dependent signaling more broadly (56.Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar, 57.Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In some cases, the arrestins work to terminate GPCR signaling activity, but in other cases they function as critical positive mediators of signaling. Because of this complex, nuanced role in regulating GPCR activity, one might imagine that specific arrestins could dictate which GPCRs communicate with the CBM signalosome, possibly in a cell type-specific manner. Based on our work and that of Sun and Lin, we suggest that in certain nonhematopoietic cells, such as endothelial cells, β-arrestin 2 replaces PDK1 as a scaffold for assembly of CARMA3-containing CBM signalosomes, in response to ligation of specific GPCRs that include PAR-1 and the LPA receptor (Fig. 7).It is important to place our current work into the context of what is already known regarding thrombin induction of both ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. As noted earlier, NF-κB activation is a cornerstone in the regulation of these two genes, but other signal transduction events are also required to achieve optimal induction, some of which are specific to one gene or the other. Most relevant to our work is the fact that thrombin-induced PI3K activation is clearly crucial for the ultimate induction of both genes (2.Minami T. Sugiyama A. Wu S.Q. Abid R. Kodama T. Aird W.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 22.Rahman A. Fazal F. Antioxid.

Chem. 2003; 278: 6976-6984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), even though our studies indicate that PI3K activity is not particularly important for the proximal steps in the canonical NF-κB activation pathway, at least not for those leading to phosphorylation of IκB and p65 nuclear translocation.It is therefore likely that the crucial role of PI3K lies in its stimulation of parallel pathways regulating ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 transcription. For example, it is clear that VCAM-1 induction depends not only on NF-κB activation but also on simultaneous activation of the GATA-2 transcription factor, which is PI3K-dependent (Fig. 7) (2.Minami T. Sugiyama A. Wu S.Q. Abid R. Kodama T. Aird W.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24.Minami T. Abid M.R. Zhang J. King G. Kodama T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 47632-47641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Others have shown that Akt activation, following thrombin-induced PI3K stimulation, is important for induction of ICAM-1 gene expression (23.Rahman A. True A.L. Anwar K.N. Ye R.D. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, it remains uncertain as to precisely how Akt contributes. Although evidence exists that Akt can directly phosphorylate components of the IκB kinase complex, contributing to its activation, this action of Akt appears to mostly impact IKKα and the noncanonical NF-κB pathway (59.Gustin J.A. Korgaonkar C.K. Pincheira R. Li Q. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16473-16481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 60.Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R.

Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1490-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Thus, in the setting of thrombin stimulation, Akt-responsive IKKα activation may not be sufficient for robust stimulation of the canonical pathway, leading to IκB phosphorylation, without the contributions of the CBM signalosome. Another explanation for the role of Akt stems from the observation that Akt can phosphorylate the p65 subunit of NF-κB, an event that increases its transcriptional capacity (Fig. 7) (63.Madrid L.V. Mayo M.W. Reuther J.Y. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18934-18940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 64.Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3863-3869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Finally, PI3K activation can lead to stimulation of NADPH oxidase and generation of reactive oxygen species (66.Hawkins P.T. Davidson K. Stephens L.R. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2007; 74: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because NF-κB is a redox-sensitive transcription factor (67.Pantano C. Reynaert N.L. van der Vliet A. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 1791-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), this is yet another mechanism whereby PI3K may play a critical role in the downstream regulation of NF-κB-responsive gene transcription, without playing a dramatic role in CBM signalosome-dependent IκB phosphorylation and p65 nuclear translocation.In summary, we show here that the CBM signalosome plays a critical role in mediating an important pathophysiologic response to thrombin, namely the induction of adhesion molecules on the surface of endothelial cells exposed to thrombin. This is an important event in a variety of conditions because adhesion molecules mediate the recruitment of inflammatory cells to sites of injury. In the case of atherogenesis, injury may be initiated by the chronic deposition of cholesterol in the vessel wall, with subsequent plaque rupture and thrombus formation. Thrombin generated locally in response to this injury stimulates recruitment of a variety of leukocytes through induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, which may further exacerbate the problem. However, similar cycles of injury and thrombosis may occur at sites of trauma and/or infection, where thrombin induction of adhesion molecules is beneficial and necessary for the wound-healing response. Although further work will be required to understand how PAR-1 communicates with the CBM signalosome, there now exists potential for targeting the signalosome in treatment of vascular conditions, such as atherosclerosis, where thrombin-induced NF-κB activation plays a pathologic role. This goal is potentially within grasp because an inhibitor of the MALT1 protease, the enzymatically active component of the signalosome, has now been described (68.Rebeaud F. Hailfinger S. Posevitz-Fejfar A. Tapernoux M. Moser R. Rueda D. Gaide O. Guzzardi M. Iancu E.M. Rufer N. Fasel N. Thome M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus, the CBM signalosome is “drugable” and therefore represents an attractive target for pharmaceutical development. IntroductionThrombin is a serine protease produced during intravascular coagulation, typically as a consequence of vascular injury (1.Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). Although thrombin plays a central role in furthering the coagulation cascade by cleaving fibrinogen to produce fibrin, it also possesses the ability to act like a traditional hormone and elicit responses in a variety of cell types, including circulating platelets and endothelial cells (1.Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). These cellular responses are mediated by a small family of GPCRs 3The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorICAM-1intracellular adhesion molecule-1VCAM-1vascular cell adhesion molecule-1PARprotease activated receptorCARMACARD-containing MAGUK proteinMALTmucosa associated lymphoid tissueCBMCARMA-Bcl10-MALT1IKKIκB kinasePDK1phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1CARDcaspase recruitment domainEGFREGF receptorLPAlysophosphatidic acidMEFmouse embryonic fibroblast. that are activated by thrombin through an unusual mechanism. Specifically, thrombin-dependent cleavage removes the N-terminal sequence of a target receptor, unmasking a cryptic peptide ligand that is present within the extracellular domain of the receptor itself. This tethered ligand is then able to interact with the ligand-binding pocket of the receptor to stimulate intracellular signaling (1.Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). As a result, the receptors that are activated in this manner have been termed protease-activated receptors, or PARs. Currently, four members of the family have been identified, PAR-1 through PAR-4, although not all are directly acted upon by thrombin and instead represent targets of other proteases such as trypsin (2.Minami T. Sugiyama A. Wu S.Q. Abid R. Kodama T. Aird W.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 3.Major C.D. Santulli R.J. Derian C.K. Andrade-Gordon P.

Haemost. 2008; 99: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Because thrombin is short-lived in the circulation, most of its effects are exerted locally, near its site of generation. Consequently, endothelial cells adjacent to a site of tissue injury and coagulation represent a particularly important target of thrombin action. The predominant receptor for thrombin on endothelial cells appears to be PAR-1 (6.O'Brien P.J. Prevost N. Molino M. Hollinger M.K. Woolkalis M.J. Woulfe D.S. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13502-13509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and although many specific endothelial responses follow stimulation of PAR-1, most can be characterized as contributing to “endothelial dysfunction” (7.Croce K. Libby P. Curr. Opin Hematol. 2007; 14: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 8.Borissoff J.I. Spronk H.M. Heeneman S. ten Cate H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2009; 82: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This is defined as a breakdown in the ability of the endothelium to maintain appropriate vascular tone, permeability, metabolism, and production of biologically active substances (9.Le Brocq M. Leslie S.J. Milliken P. Megson I.L. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 1631-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Central to the phenomenon of endothelial dysfunction is the expression of adhesion molecules for recruitment of inflammatory cells and the production of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. All of these effects are key to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, in which early vascular injury caused by cholesterol deposition leads to thrombin-induced inflammation and propagation of vessel damage.Activation of the NF-κB transcription factor represents one of the foremost mechanisms responsible for thrombin-induced endothelial dysfunction. As for many activators of NF-κB, this occurs through the so-called canonical pathway, whereby activation depends upon stimulation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex (10.Fazal F. Bijli K.M.

IKK in turn directs the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB, a protein that sequesters NF-κB (particularly in the form of RelA/p65) in the cytoplasm (20.Ghosh S. Hayden M.S. Nat. Rev.

Much of our understanding of the complex, now referred to as the CBM signalosome, comes from earlier work in lymphocytes where an analogous signalosome containing the related CARMA1 protein mediates NF-κB activation downstream of the antigen receptor (34.Blonska M. Lin X. Immunol. Rev. 2009; 228: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 35.Rawlings D.J. Sommer K. Moreno-García M.E. Nat. Rev.

STKE. 2007; 2007: pe21Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the case of lymphocytes, antigen stimulation leads to activation of PKC, which in turn phosphorylates CARMA1, causing a conformational change that exposes the CARMA1 caspase recruitment domain (CARD), a region responsible for binding Bcl10 (38.Matsumoto R.

MALT1 is then recruited, and the intact signalosome interacts with and stimulates the IKK complex.Because thrombin-dependent NF-κB activation clearly requires PKC activation as an upstream event, we asked whether the CBM signalosome might function as an integral component of the thrombin-responsive signaling machinery. Here we show that all three proteins, CARMA3, Bcl10, and MALT1, are essential for thrombin to effectively stimulate the canonical NF-κB pathway in endothelial cells. Importantly, we also show that disrupting the CBM signalosome in endothelial cells has important pathophysiologic consequences, because it effectively blocks the ability of thrombin to induce expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 and reduces the thrombin-dependent adhesion of monocytes to these endothelial cells. As such, the thrombin receptor now joins a small number of GPCRs that utilize the CBM signalosome to signal to NF-κB. Several of these GPCRs share the property of causing endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation in the context of atherosclerosis. As a result, the CBM signalosome can be seen as an increasingly attractive target for pharmaceutical intervention in our attempts to combat multiple common instigators of atherogenesis."

Frassica F.J. Chen X. Wan M. Cao X. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7 (this issue): 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar demonstrate that this event is mediated by osteoclastic mobilization of active transforming growth factor β1, which is inhibited by a common antiosteoporosis drug. Osteoporosis is endemic in developed countries; approximately half of 65-year-old white or Asian women ultimately experience a spontaneous fracture. Regardless of cause, osteoporosis results from an imbalance of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, wherein the net activities of the former supersede the latter. Thus, osteoporosis therapy involves either suppression of bone resorption or stimulation of formation. The discovery that intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates bone formation yielded the first and only bone anabolic drug (Neer et al., 2001Neer R.M. Arnaud C.D. Zanchetta J.R. Prince R. Gaich G.A. Reginster J.Y. Hodsman A.B. Eriksen E.F. Ish-Shalom S. Genant H.K. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1434-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (3617) Google Scholar), but the most common approach to preventing and treating osteoporosis is osteoclast inhibition. Osteoclasts and osteoblasts have an interdependent relationship; the recruitment of each depends upon the other. Osteoclasts differentiate from macrophage precursors under the aegis of RANK ligand and M-CSF, produced by osteoblast lineage cells. On the other side of the equation, it is the bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts that attracts osteoblasts to the bone surface, a process known as skeletal remodeling. This ever-occurring event consists of focal removal and subsequent replacement of bone. Thus, bone remodeling is characterized by tethering of osteoclast and osteoblast recruitment and function. If remodeling is imbalanced and the magnitude of resorption surpasses formation, osteoporosis ensues. Patients lose bone by two general mechanisms that are dictated by remodeling kinetics. Estrogen deficiency, which represents the most common cause of osteoporosis, is a high turnover state in which both formation and resorption are accelerated, but the relative activity of the osteoclast is greater than that of the osteoblast. Consequently, suppression of the osteoclast by hormone replacement had been the standard of care for decades. With the realization that estrogens increase risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular complications in older women, bisphosphonates, which directly target osteoclasts, have become the most common treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Given the absolute increase in osteoclast activity in estrogen-deficient osteoporosis, the effectiveness of bisphosphonates is not surprising. These drugs are nonhydrolyzable pyrophosphate analogs that bind bone mineral with extremely high affinity and reside within the skeleton until mobilized by osteoclasts. Alendronate, the most commonly administered bisphosphonate, maintains bone mass and reduces fracture risk of postmenopausal, osteoporotic women for as long as a decade with minimal complications in the great majority of patients (Bone et al., 2004Bone H.G. Hosking D. Devogelaer J.P. Tucci J.R. Emkey R.D. Tonino R.P. Rodriguez-Portales J.A. Downs R.W. Gupta J. Santora A.C. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 1189-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). The capacity of bisphosphonates to enhance bone mass reflects the fact that it incapacitates osteoclasts and thus dampens remodeling. The most common secondary form of osteoporosis is that induced by glucocorticoids, but its skeletal dynamics are distinctly different than those resulting from estrogen deprivation. Whereas bone remodeling is accelerated with menopause, it is suppressed by prolonged administration of glucocorticoids. Thus, glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis represents a low remodeling form of the disease in which both formation and resorption are suppressed but the former is more so than the latter. Stimulation of bone formation by intermittent PTH administration represents the most effective current approach to this condition, but most patients are treated with bisphosphonates, which further suppress remodeling. Because osteogenesis is coupled to resorption in the remodeling process, alendronate's antiosteoclastic properties blunt the bone-forming capacity of simultaneously administered PTH (Black et al., 2003Black D.M. Greenspan S.L. Ensrud K.E. Palermo L. McGowan J.A. Lang T.F. Garnero P. Bouxsein M.L. Bilezikian J.P. Rosen C.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1207-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Because the principal role of remodeling is probably to replace effete bone with new, its prolonged suppression probably compromises the skeleton's biomechanical properties and evidence indicates such is the case with alendronate (Allen and Burr, 2007Allen M.R. Burr D.B. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2007; 22: 1759-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the specific mechanism by which bisphosphonates suppress osteoclast activity is central to developing antiresorptive strategies that spare bone formation. Although remodeling has been known for decades to be essential for skeletal integrity, the means by which osteoclasts recruit osteoblasts to the site of resorption is among the most important yet enigmatic issues regarding skeletal biology and treating osteoporosis. Last year Tang et al., 2009Tang Y. Wu X. Lei W. Pang L. Wan C. Shi Z. Zhao L. Nagy T.R. Peng X. Hu J. et al.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar demonstrated that active TGF-β1 is a likely molecule attracting osteoblasts to sites of prior osteoclast activity. In this scenario, the activated growth factor, mobilized from bone matrix by osteoclasts, establishes a gradient that attracts Sca1+CD29+CD45−CD11b− mesenchymal stem cells to sites of bone resorption where they putatively undergo osteoblast differentiation. In the current issue of Cell Stem Cell, the same group extends these observations to the practical issue of treating osteoporosis with bisphosphonates (Wu et al., 2010Wu X. Pang L. Lei W. Lu W. Li J. Li Z. Frassica F.J. Chen X. Wan M. Cao X. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7 (this issue): 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism by which alendronate blunts bone formation, Wu et al., 2010Wu X. Pang L. Lei W. Lu W. Li J. Li Z. Frassica F.J. Chen X. Wan M. Cao X. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7 (this issue): 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar first asked whether the drug arrests PTH-stimulated osteoblast differentiation. This model was not supported by their results, despite observing reduced osteogenesis and a decreased number of bone-forming cells, in vivo, a circumstance reminiscent of absence of active TGF-β1, which recruits osteoblast precursors to the bone surface (Tang et al., 2009Tang Y. Wu X. Lei W. Pang L. Wan C. Shi Z. Zhao L. Nagy T.R. Peng X. Hu J. et al.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). In fact, the authors found that although the abundance of total TGF-β1 in bone marrow is unaffected by treatment with PTH and alendronate, alone or in combination, the hormone increases the active state of the growth factor while the bisphosphonate reduces it. This outcome is mirrored by the number of cells expressing Smad2/3, which this group established mediates migration of osteogenic precursors to remodeling sites (Tang et al., 2009Tang Y. Wu X. Lei W. Pang L. Wan C. Shi Z. Zhao L. Nagy T.R. Peng X. Hu J. et al.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). The authors also find that absence of TGF-β1, in mice, prevents PTH-stimulated bone formation. Alendronate does not alter differentiation of TGF-β1−/− osteoblasts, in vitro, but reduces their PTH-stimulated abundance, in vivo. Thus, the bisphosphonate, whose sole established direct target in vivo is osteoclasts, probably inhibits bone formation by arresting active TGF-β1 mobilization from bone matrix, thereby preventing recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells to remodeling sites. Expanding upon their previous observations, the authors propose that the target osteoblast precursors cells are Sca1+CD29+CD45−CD11b−. To determine whether such is the case, they isolated and expanded multipotential mesenchymal cells with this phenotype. Confirming their osteogenic capacity, in vivo, these cells form bone when placed under the renal capsule. Finally, the authors demonstrate that TGF-β1−/− mice fail to normally recruit Sca1+CD29+CD45−CD11b− cells to the bone surface in response to PTH. These studies indicate that alendronate suppresses PTH-stimulated bone formation by inhibiting osteoclast-mediated mobilization of active TGF-β1, thereby reducing migration of osteoblast precursors to sites of remodeling (Figure 1). Currently, osteoporosis patients are limited to 2 year cycles of PTH treatment. Thus, a logical strategy to prevent loss of accumulated bone is to utilize an antiresorptive agent between episodes of PTH administration (Black et al., 2005Black D.M. Bilezikian J.P. Ensrud K.E. Greenspan S.L. Palermo L. Hue T. Lang T.F. McGowan J.A. Rosen C.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Wu et al., 2010Wu X. Pang L. Lei W. Lu W. Li J.

Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7 (this issue): 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar predict that unlike simultaneous administration of the two drugs, this sequential strategy will not suppress bone formation because osteoclast-mediated mobilization of TGF-β1 will be intact during PTH-only cycles (Tang et al., 2009Tang Y.

This hypothesis is challenged, however, by the decade-long persistence of bisphosphonates in the skeleton after cessation of their administration (Drake et al., 2008Drake M.T. Clarke B.L. Khosla S. Mayo Clin. Proc. 2008; 83: 1032-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The elegant experiments of the Cao laboratory underscore the necessity of developing short-acting antiresorptive agents that will permit recovery of osteoclast-mediated mobilization of the growth factor during the period of anabolic therapy (Wu et al., 2010Wu X.

We found that the release of active transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 during osteoclastic bone resorption is inhibited by alendronate. We showed that mouse Sca-1-positive (Sca-1+) bone marrow stromal cells are a skeletal stem cell subset, which are recruited to bone remodeling sites by active TGF-β1 in response to bone resorption.

It has been shown earlier that the member of the NF-κB family of inflammation-associated transcription factors, p65/RelA, is cleaved during chlamydial infection, and a chlamydial protease has been implicated. We here provide evidence that the chlamydial protease chlamydial protease-like activity factor (CPAF) is responsible for degradation of p65/RelA during infection. This degradation was seen in human and in mouse cells infected with either Chlamydia trachomatis or Chlamydia pneumoniae where it correlated with the expression of CPAF and CPAF activity. Isolated expression of active C. trachomatis or C. pneumoniae CPAF in human or mouse cells yielded a p65 fragment of indistinguishable size from the one generated during infection. Expression of active CPAF in human cells caused a mild reduction in IκBα phosphorylation but a strong reduction in NF-κB reporter activity in response to interleukin-1β. Infection with C. trachomatis likewise reduced this responsiveness. IL-1β-dependent secretion of IL-8 was further reduced by CPAF expression.

Chlamydia (Chlamydophila) pneumoniae is an extremely common agent of usually mild respiratory infection and may through infection of arteries play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (4.Belland R.J. Ouellette S.P. Gieffers J. Byrne G.I. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). One clinically relevant feature of chlamydial infections is the potential for chronicity. A considerable share of female infertility for instance is the result of chronic pelvic inflammatory disease caused by C. trachomatis (3.Belland R. Ojcius D.M. Byrne G.I. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 530-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Chlamydiae have a life style that is atypical for bacteria. Chlamydiae can only replicate inside human (or animal) cells where they reside in a membrane-bounded vacuole termed inclusion. From this site the bacteria are able to interact with metabolic and signaling pathways of the host cell. Chlamydial infection causes alterations in gene expression, redirects vesicle transport especially to achieve lipid acquisition by the vacuole, blocks apoptosis, and can induce non-apoptotic cell death in human cells (5.Moulder J.W.

Reed J.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1879-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The protease CT441 is not known to be secreted from the vacuole to the cytosol, and although a cytosolic function of the protease is not impossible, CT441 is likely to play a role in the processing of bacterial proteins within the inclusion, as has been proposed for other bacterial Tsp (17.Silber K.R. Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). CPAF on the other hand is secreted into the cytosol of infected cells, and its expression and secretion occur around mid-cycle of the chlamydial infection (about 20 h post-infection for C. trachomatis), which coincides with the reported cleavage of p65. We, therefore, undertook this study to test whether CPAF is able to cleave p65 and may be responsible for its cleavage during infection. Our results show that CPAF from both C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae can cleave both human and mouse p65 and can inhibit the activation of NF-κB that occurs in response to external IL-1β. Analysis of p65 cleavage during infection suggests that the observed cleavage of p65 during infection is mediated by CPAF. In addition to other known effects, CPAF may, therefore, contribute to chlamydial replication by subversion of the NF-κB-mediated host defense. The human embryonic kidney cell line T-REx-293, which stably expresses the tetracycline repressor (Invitrogen), was maintained in humidified air at 5% CO2 and 37 °C in Dulbecco modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, tetracycline negative; PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria) and 5 μg/μl blasticidin (PAA Laboratories). T-REx-293 clones stably expressing gyrB-CPAF (T-REx-293 CPAF K6) were generated by electroporation with the pcDNA4/TO/myc-His-gyrB-CPAF construct and antibiotic selection as described before (12.Paschen S.A. Christian J.G. Vier J. Schmidt F. Walch A. Ojcius D.M. Häcker G. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured as above but in the presence of zeocin (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that had been immortalized by SV40 large T antigen were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. CPAF expression was induced by the addition of 5 ng/μl anhydrotetracycline (AHT; IBA, Göttingen, Germany), and oligomerization was induced by adding 1 μm coumermycin (CM; Sigma). The proteasomal inhibitors epoxomicin (Calbiochem) and clastolactacystin β-lactone (Sigma) were added as indicated. The C. trachomatis strain serovar L2 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). To infect T-REx-293 or MEF cells, the culture medium was replaced with DMEM without FCS and antibiotics before the addition of the bacteria. Chlamydiae were added to a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of three unless otherwise indicated. After 2 h, 10% FCS was added. At indicated time points, cells were harvested and lysed by incubation with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate,1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). C. pneumoniae strain CM-1 was obtained from ATCC. Before infection, culture media was removed and changed to infection media consisting of DMEM, C. pneumoniae, and cycloheximide 1 μg/ml. The cells were then centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 35 min at 35 °C. Transient transfections of T-REx-293 and MEF cells with pcDNA4-CPAF and pcDNA3.1myc-HIS A-CT441 (a gift from Dr. Frank Hänel, Leibniz-Institute for Nature Products and Infection Biology, Hans-Knöll-Institute, Jena, Germany) were performed using FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. In T-REx-293 cells, CPAF expression was induced by the addition of AHT/CM. Both compounds were added 1 h after transfection. In MEF cells lacking the tet repressor, where induction of the CPAF was not necessary, 1 μm coumermycin was added 1 h after transfection to cluster gyrB-CPAF (12.Paschen S.A. Christian J.G. Vier J. Schmidt F. Walch A. Ojcius D.M. Häcker G. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). T-REx-293 CPAF K6 cells (12.Paschen S.A. Christian J.G. Vier J. Schmidt F. Walch A. Ojcius D.M. Häcker G. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β (Peprotech, Hamburg, Germany) for various times. Cells were harvested and washed with PBS. Cells were pelleted (7 min, 1500 rpm, 4 °C) and incubated in ice-cold hypotonic buffer A (10 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.9) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture on ice for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were lysed by passage through a 26-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml syringe. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 6,800 rpm at 4 °C. The cytosolic fraction was subjected to a second centrifugation step for 15 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The nuclear fraction was washed 8 times in the hypotonic buffer and then incubated in cold buffer B (20 mm Hepes, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, pH7.9) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C and 300 rpm. Finally the nuclear fractions were centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm, 4 °C. The supernatants were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Cells were harvested after infection or CPAF expression and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Cell extracts were separated using EZ-Run Gels (Fisher), and proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Equivalent amounts of protein were loaded, and equal loading was confirmed by detection of β-actin using a specific antibody (Sigma). Membranes were probed with anti-caspase 8, anti-IκB, anti-phospho-IκB, anti-p42/p44 Erk, anti-phospho-p42/p44 Erk, anti-IKK-α (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-IKK-β (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, CA), anti-histone deacetylase 1 (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany), anti-GAPDH (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), anti-vimentin (Acris, Herford, Germany), anti-p65/RelA (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany), and anti-CPAF (generated by immunization of rabbits with a peptide from the C-terminal fragment of C. trachomatis CPAF, Pineda, Berlin, Germany) antibodies. Proteins were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and a chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare). Cells stably expressing CPAF were lentivirally transduced with an NF-κB-luciferase reporter construct obtained from Dr. Hans Häcker (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). 2 × 105 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and either infected with C. trachomatis or treated with AHT/CM to induce and activate CPAF. For the times indicated, 10 ng/ml IL-1β was added. After various periods of time cells were lysed using luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), and firefly luciferase activity was assayed with a luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Pforzheim, Germany). Cell viability was tested by the MTT (Sigma) assay. After treatment of the cells with either C. trachomatis, AHT/CM, and/or IL-1β, MTT was added to cells at a concentration of 0.5 mg/μl and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The formazan crystals generated in viable cells were dissolved in DMSO, and the optical density at a wavelength of 570 nm was measured using a photometer (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany). T-REx-293 CPAF K6 cells were stimulated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) to activate NF-κB signaling. Simultaneously, AHT/CM was added to induce and activate CPAF. Supernatants were collected after 8 h, and commercially available ELISA (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden-Nordenstedt, Germany, OptEIA™ set from BD Biosciences) was used to determine the concentration of secreted IL-8. The assays were performed as instructed by the manufacturer. Human 293 cells (we used the variant T-REx-293 for better comparison with CPAF expressing cells; below) or MEFs were infected with C. trachomatis or C. pneumoniae, and p65 levels were followed over time by Western blotting. As reported earlier, p65 fragmentation was observed (13.Lad S.P. Li J. da Silva Correia J. Pan Q. Gadwal S. Ulevitch R.J. Li E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2933-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A fragment of ∼25 kDa appeared in human T-REx-293 cells between 16 and 18 h upon infection with C. trachomatis (Fig. 1A). As for the cleavage of other cellular substrates, the time course of cleavage varied with infectious dose (higher bacterial numbers caused earlier and stronger degradation; not shown). The time course of p65 cleavage correlated well with the appearance of active CPAF and with the cleavage of cellular vimentin, a well known CPAF substrate (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained when MEFs were used for infection with the exception that two fragments of similar size appeared (Fig. 1B). This latter finding is in contrast with the earlier report that found cleavage only in human but not mouse cells (13.Lad S.P. Li J. da Silva Correia J. Pan Q. Gadwal S. Ulevitch R.J. Li E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2933-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The discrepancy may be explained by the use of different chlamydial strains or different infectious doses. In our model, there was again a good correlation between the appearance of active CPAF and the degradation of both vimentin and p65 from mouse. Infection of either human or mouse cells with C. pneumoniae caused the appearance of similar fragments (Fig. 1C), suggesting that p65 is cleaved by a chlamydial protease that is conserved between the species. CPAF is in bacteria synthesized as an inactive precursor, and its activation requires its proteolytic autoprocessing. When expressed in human cells, CPAF is inactive, but its activation can be induced by clustering of the precursor (12.Paschen S.A. Christian J.G. Vier J. Schmidt F. Walch A. Ojcius D.M. Häcker G. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18.Huang Z. Feng Y. Chen D. Wu X. Huang S. Wang X. Xiao X. Li W. Huang N. Gu L. Zhong G. Chai J. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 4: 529-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We used a system of CPAF activation by induced dimerization in human cells. In this system a fusion protein of bacterial gyrase B and the CPAF precursor is expressed in T-REx-293 cells under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (“tet-on”). Dimerization of the fusion protein is induced by the compound coumermycin, which can bind two gyrase B-molecules and thereby dimerize gyrase B-CPAF; this process leads to autoprocessing and activation of CPAF (12.Paschen S.A. Christian J.G. Vier J. Schmidt F. Walch A. Ojcius D.M. Häcker G. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We expressed and activated CPAF in this way and again monitored p65 levels by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, active CPAF (visible as the C-terminal autoprocessing product) was detectable after 6–8 h of CPAF-induction/dimerization. This correlated with the known cleavage of vimentin but also with the appearance of a p65 fragment of the same size as during infection. Disappearance of p65 was blocked by lactacystin (an inhibitor of CPAF and the cellular proteasome) but not by epoxomicin (a specific proteasome inhibitor) (Fig. 2B). Transient transfection and activation of C. trachomatis CPAF caused the appearance of the same p65 fragment. In these experiments we also transfected CT441 for comparison. As shown in Fig. 3A, CT441 likewise induced degradation of p65 as reported. However, the fragment produced by CT441 was, although similar in size, appreciably bigger than the fragment generated by either CPAF transfection or by infection with C. trachomatis, suggesting that during infection it is CPAF that degrades p65. When transfected into MEFs, C. trachomatis CPAF also caused the appearance of a p65 fragment that ran slightly higher in the SDS-PAGE than the one in human T-REx-293 cells (Fig. 3B). Transfection of CPAF from C. pneumoniae (Cpn CPAF) produced a fragment of indistinguishable size (Fig. 3B). Cleavage of p65, therefore, appears to be conserved between by Ct and Cpn CPAF as well as between human and mouse cells. To test for the functional relevance of CPAF-mediated p65-cleavage, we analyzed key steps in the activation of NF-κB in cells expressing active CPAF. T-REx-293-CPAF cells were stimulated with IL-1β, which activates the classical NF-κB-pathway through the IL-1-receptor, its adapter MyD88, and the activation of the IκB kinase IKK-β. Phosphorylated IκB is then degraded, releasing active p65, which translocates to the nucleus and activates NF-κB-dependent promoters, typically together with the NF-κB family member NF-κB1/p50 (15.Häcker H. Karin M. Sci. STKE. 2006; 2006: re13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). In cells expressing active CPAF, phosphorylation and consecutive degradation of IκBα upon stimulation with IL-1β were reduced although still clearly detectable, whereas the IL-1β-dependent phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1/2 was normal (Fig. 4A). This may reflect a destabilization of the IκBα-p65 complex due to the detectable degradation of p65 (Fig. 4A). There was no reduction in the levels of the IκB kinases IKKα/β either upon expression of active CPAF or during infection with C. trachomatis (Fig. 4, B and C). This suggests that the upstream pathway of MyD88-dependent signaling to the activation of the IKK-complex is unaffected. This is in accordance with the interpretation that it is specifically p65 and p65-dependent transcriptional activity that is targeted by CPAF during infection. To test for this activity directly, we used T-REx-293-CPAF cells that had been transduced with a lentivirus carrying an NF-κB-luciferase reported plasmid. In these cells the expression of active CPAF was induced as above for 8 h, and IL-1β was added for various periods of time. As shown in Fig. 5A, in the absence of CPAF, IL-1β induced a strong NF-κB-response as expected. When active CPAF was present, IL-1β-dependent induction was substantially reduced. As prolonged expression of active CPAF can induce cell death under these conditions, we controlled viability of the cells in parallel and found only very minor effects on viability under these conditions (Fig. 5A, right panel). A similar reduction in IL-1β-dependent NF-κB activation was detectable at later time points (i.e. upon prolonged stimulation with IL-1β) (Fig. 5A). Treatment of T-REx-293 NF-κB-luciferase cells which do not carry the CPAF construct, with AHT and CM had no effect on reporter activity (Fig. 5C). When the T-REx-293-CPAF NF-κB-luciferase cells were infected with C. trachomatis simultaneously to the addition of IL-1β, there was no effect of Chlamydia at 6 h post-infection (Fig. 5B). However, when luciferase activity was measured 24 h after infection, the activation of NF-κB was again reduced (active CPAF is detectable after 16–18 h under these conditions; Fig. 1). Although it is difficult to gauge the possible effect of bacterial factors other than CPAF during infection (especially as the viability of the cells is also affected), the magnitude of the reduction during infection was not higher than during activation of CPAF in uninfected cells (compare Fig. 5, A and B). This is in accordance with the interpretation that CPAF is the main factor that Chlamydia uses to down-regulate the response to NF-κB-inducing stimuli. The p65 fragment generated by active CPAF (the antibody detects the C-terminal fragment) remained exclusively cytosolic during stimulation with IL-1β (Fig. 6). This fragment contains the NF-κB-activating domain but lacks the nuclear localization domain (19.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar). The observed effects (no nuclear translocation and lack of reporter activity) are in accordance with these structural features. As a functional test of the relevance of this reduction in NF-κB activation by CPAF, we determined its effect on the NF-κB-dependent secretion of IL-8 upon IL-1β stimulation (20.Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We treated T-REx-293-CPAF cells with IL-1β for 8 h and induced and activated CPAF at the same time. Supernatants were analyzed for secreted IL-8. Activation of CPAF led to a clear reduction in the amounts of secreted IL-8 (Fig. 7). Taken together, these data suggest that the CPAF-dependent degradation of p65 and the consecutive reduction in NF-κB activity during infection with human or mouse cells with Chlamydia inhibits a proinflammatory response of infected host cells. Many bacteria have the ability to interfere with host signaling pathways. Chlamydia is well known for its capacity to affect gene transcription in the host; it has a type III secretion system, which it can use to inject bacterial proteins into the host cell cytoplasm, and proteolysis of host cell proteins is a recognized way by which Chlamydia exerts effects on the host cell (21.Zhong G. Trends Microbiol. 2009; 17: 467-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The majority of these proteolytic events are mediated by CPAF, which translocates from the inclusion into the cytosol by an unknown mechanism (9.Zhong G. Fan P. Ji H. Dong F. Huang Y. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that p65 is cleaved during chlamydial infection and that p65 can be cleaved by the Tsp CT441. Expression of CT441 inhibited TNF-induced activation of NF-κB (13.Lad S.P. Li J. da Silva Correia J. Pan Q. Gadwal S. Ulevitch R.J. Li E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2933-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14.Lad S.P. Yang G. Scott D.A. Wang G. Nair P. Mathison J. Reddy V.S. Li E. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 6619-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our data show that both C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae CPAF can cleave p65 and suggest that CPAF is the protease that is responsible for this cleavage during infection. Although CPAF was tested in the earlier study and was found not to cleave p65 (13.Lad S.P. Li J. da Silva Correia J. Pan Q. Gadwal S. Ulevitch R.J. Li E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2933-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), this was done by transient expression of CPAF. It is now clear that CPAF is not active when expressed in that way but requires intermolecular clustering for its activation (12.Paschen S.A. Christian J.G. Vier J. Schmidt F. Walch A. Ojcius D.M. Häcker G. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18.Huang Z. Feng Y. Chen D. Wu X. Huang S. Wang X. Xiao X. Li W. Huang N. Gu L. Zhong G. Chai J. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 4: 529-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22.Dong F. Pirbhai M. Zhong Y. Zhong G. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This peculiarity explains the lack of activity of CPAF in those experiments. CT441 was further shown not to cleave mouse p65 (13.Lad S.P. Li J. da Silva Correia J. Pan Q. Gadwal S. Ulevitch R.J. Li E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2933-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14.Lad S.P. Yang G. Scott D.A. Wang G. Nair P. Mathison J. Reddy V.S. Li E. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 6619-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas CPAF did (this study). However, although the previous studies also failed to detect p65 cleavage during C. trachomatis infection of mouse cells, we did detect this cleavage. Infection and growth of Chlamydia in mammalian cells can vary strongly between host cells, and it is plausible that the lack of detectable p65 cleavage was the result of less efficient growth of C. trachomatis in the NIH 3T3 cells used (13.Lad S.P. Li J. da Silva Correia J. Pan Q. Gadwal S. Ulevitch R.J. Li E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2933-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We find clear, albeit somewhat weaker cleavage of mouse p65 compared with human p65; because recombinant CT441 can cleave human but not mouse p65, this profile, therefore, also argues for CPAF as the protease responsible. Furthermore, the p65 cleavage product generated during infection is indistinguishable on SDS-PAGE from the product generated by CPAF cleavage but was slightly smaller than the product generated by expression of CT441. Last, although CPAF is clearly secreted into the cytosol, there is no reported evidence that CT441 is released from the vacuole into the host cell. Together, we believe that this is strong evidence that the cleavage of p65 during chlamydial infection is mediated by CPAF. It is perhaps surprising that two chlamydial proteases, CPAF and CT441, have the ability to cleave at least human p65. However, both proteases have structural features of Tsp (although only CT441 has the typical PDZ-domain), and this may explain this related cleavage specificity. Tsp are a relatively little characterized group of bacterial proteases (23.Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 28-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 24.Liao D.I. Qian J. Chisholm D.A. Jordan D.B. Diner B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and are usually involved in processing steps of bacterial proteins (25.Hara H. Yamamoto Y. Higashitani A. Suzuki H. Nishimura Y. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4799-4813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Ostberg Y. Carroll J.A. Pinne M. Krum J.G. Rosa P. Bergström S. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2074-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). CT441 may, therefore, have important functions in growth and development of Chlamydia in the inclusion. Although this may also be the case for CPAF, a number of host cell substrates have been identified that are cleaved by active CPAF and that are cleaved during infection (21.Zhong G. Trends Microbiol. 2009; 17: 467-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The precise role of CPAF for chlamydial development is not clear. Effects of CPAF activity include impairment in antigen presentation (cleavage of transcription factors (9.Zhong G. Fan P. Ji H. Dong F. Huang Y. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and the major histocompatibility complex-like molecule CD1d (27.Kawana K. Quayle A.J. Ficarra M. Ibana J.A. Shen L. Kawana Y. Yang H. Marrero L. Yavagal S. Greene S.J. Zhang Y.X. Pyles R.B. Blumberg R.S. Schust D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7368-7375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)) and the cleavage of cytoskeletal proteins (vimentin, cytokeratin-8 (10.Dong F. Su H. Huang Y. Zhong Y. Zhong G. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 3863-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11.Kumar Y. Valdivia R.H. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 4: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar)). Any of these events may contribute to the success of Chlamydia in surviving and replicating in human cells. However, the phylum Chlamydiae does not only include the human-pathogenic chlamydiae such as C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae but also a large group of bacteria that have been found as symbionts in free-living amoebae (28.Horn M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 62: 113-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Notably, these “environmental chlamydiae” can also contain genes coding for CPAF (29.Horn M. Collingro A. Schmitz-Esser S. Beier C.L. Purkhold U. Fartmann B. Brandt P. Nyakatura G.J. Droege M. Frishman D. Rattei T. Mewes H.W. Wagner M. Science. 2004; 304: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It may, therefore, be speculated that CPAF is an enzyme that has already been required for replication of Chlamydia-like organisms (the evolutionary precursor of today's bacteria) in single-celled hosts. Some core CPAF functions may be conserved to all these Chlamydia-like organisms, and some may have been acquired for survival in metazoan hosts, and p65 cleavage would be an example of the latter category. NF-κB is an important transcription factor family in the immune response, and it is likely that impaired NF-κB signaling will be of benefit to Chlamydia. During the infection and the accompanying inflammation, a broad array of inflammatory mediators is produced that also signal to the infected cells. As in these cells, NF-κB activation will be impaired; this inhibition can be expected to limit the defense response of the infected cell and to enhance replication of Chlamydia. CPAF may, therefore, have adopted a new function in human pathogenic chlamydiae, which adds to the ability of this group of bacteria to survive for a sufficient time to replicate despite a functional immune system. This novel function may even contribute to the ability of the bacteria to survive the host response and to proceed into the chronic state of the infection. We thank Dr. Frank Hänel, Jena, Germany for providing the CT441-expression plasmid and Dr. Hans Häcker, Memphis, TN for help with the generation of the NF-κB-luciferase reporter cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2099584100,"Immunodominance is defined as restricted responsiveness of T cells to a few selected epitopes from complex antigens. Strategies currently used for elucidating CD4(+) T cell epitopes are inadequate. To understand the mechanism of epitope selection for helper T cells, we established a cell-free antigen processing system composed of defined proteins: human leukocyte antigen-DR1 (HLA-DR1), HLA-DM and cathepsins. Our reductionist system successfully identified the physiologically selected immunodominant epitopes of two model antigens: hemagglutinin-1 (HA1) from influenza virus (A/Texas/1/77) and type II collagen (CII). When applied for identification of new epitopes from a recombinant liver-stage antigen of malaria falciparum (LSA-NRC) or HA1 from H5N1 influenza virus ('avian flu'), the system selected single epitopes from each protein that were confirmed to be immunodominant by their capacity to activate CD4(+) T cells from H5N1-immunized HLA-DR1-transgenic mice and LSA-NRC-vaccinated HLA-DR1-positive human volunteers. Thus, we provide a new tool for the identification of physiologically relevant helper T cell epitopes from antigens."

Schmelz M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) is immediately familiar. Research in the field of pruritoception has added to our understanding of this area of sensory neurobiology as it pertains to both normal and pathological conditions. In particular, much progress has been made on the mechanisms and circuits of itch, which we review here."
https://openalex.org/W1982160073,"Angiogenesis is critically dependent on endothelial cell-specific transcriptional mechanisms. However, the molecular processes that regulate chromatin domains and thereby dictate transcription of key endothelial genes are poorly understood. Here, we report that, in endothelial cells, angiogenic signal-mediated transcriptional induction of Vegfr1 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1) is dependent on the histone chaperone, HIRA (histone cell cycle regulation-defective homolog A). Our molecular analyses revealed that, in response to angiogenic signals, HIRA is induced in endothelial cells and mediates incorporation of lysine 56 acetylated histone H3.3 (H3acK56) at the chromatin domain of Vegfr1. HIRA-mediated incorporation of H3acK56 is a general mechanism associated with transcriptional induction of several angiogenic genes in endothelial cells. Depletion of HIRA inhibits H3acK56 incorporation and transcriptional induction of Vegfr1 and other angiogenic genes. Our functional analyses revealed that depletion of HIRA abrogates endothelial network formation on Matrigel and inhibits angiogenesis in an in vivo Matrigel plug assay. Furthermore, analysis in a laser-induced choroidal neovascularization model showed that depletion of HIRA significantly inhibits neovascularization. Our results for the first time decipher a histone chaperone (HIRA)-dependent molecular mechanism in endothelial gene regulation and indicate that histone chaperones could be new targets for angiogenesis therapy.

Angiogenesis is a key event in many physiological processes like development, wound healing, and reproduction (1.Carmeliet P. Nature. 2005; 438: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2762) Google Scholar) and is also critical in certain pathological disorders like tumor growth (2.Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7153) Google Scholar, 3.Bergers G. Benjamin L.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (2791) Google Scholar) and in ocular pathologies involving neovascularization like age-related macular degeneration (4.Ferrara N. Mass R.D. Campa C. Kim R. Annu. Rev. Med. 2007; 58: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). During angiogenesis, signaling from angiogenic factors alters the gene expression pattern in quiescent endothelial cells. The altered gene expression pattern contributes to cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and cell-cell adhesion leading to tubulogenesis to form new vessels.

Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7667) Google Scholar). VEGFR1 expression is up-regulated in blood vessels that are growing and being remodeled (6.Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar, 7.Kappas N.C. Zeng G. Chappell J.C. Kearney J.B. Hazarika S. Kallianos K.G. Patterson C. Annex B.H. Bautch V.L. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 847-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Gene targeting studies demonstrated that VEGFR1−/− mice die in utero between days 8.5 and 9.0 (6.Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar) because of a lack of organized vasculature. Because deletion of the VEGFR1 tyrosine kinase domain is compatible with normal vascular development (8.Hiratsuka S. Minowa O. Kuno J. Noda T. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9349-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar), it appears that VEGFR1 functions as a “decoy receptor” for VEGFA during embryogenesis. However, several lines of evidence also suggest that function of VEGFR1 during angiogenesis is not limited to its VEGF trapping mechanism. Activation of VEGFR1 by VEGF induces migration of endothelial cells lacking VEGFR2 (9.Barleon B. Sozzani S. Zhou D. Weich H.A. Mantovani A. Marmé D. Blood. 1996; 87: 3336-3343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VEGFR1 loss is associated with decreased vascular sprout formation and vascular branching (10.Kearney J.B. Kappas N.C. Ellerstrom C. DiPaola F.W. Bautch V.L. Blood. 2004; 103: 4527-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This phenotype was also observed in vivo, because VEGFR1−/− embryos had defective sprouting from the dorsal aorta (10.Kearney J.B. Kappas N.C. Ellerstrom C. DiPaola F.W. Bautch V.L. Blood. 2004; 103: 4527-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In addition to VEGFA, placental growth factor and VEGFB are also known to bind VEGFR1 (11.Rahimi N. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 818-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It has been shown that, in pathological conditions, activation of VEGFR1 by placental growth factor contributes to angiogenesis (12.Carmeliet P. Moons L. Luttun A. Vincenti V. Compernolle V. De Mol M. Wu Y. Bono F. Devy L. Beck H. Scholz D. Acker T. DiPalma T. Dewerchin M. Noel A. Stalmans I. Barra A. Blacher S. Vandendriessche T. Ponten A. Eriksson U. Plate K.H. Foidart J.M. Schaper W. Charnock-Jones D.S. Hicklin D.J. Herbert J.M. Collen D. Persico M.G. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Thus, the biological outcome of VEGFR1 function might also be influenced through type of binding ligand. Other studies showed that bone marrow-derived, VEGFR1 expressing circulating endothelial progenitor cells can contribute to the angiogenesis and growth of certain tumors (13.Reyes M. Dudek A.

Although VEGFR1 is required for normal vascular development (6.Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar) and contributes to angiogenesis in pathological conditions (12.Carmeliet P. Moons L. Luttun A. Vincenti V. Compernolle V.

Med. 2001; 7: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar), transcriptional mechanisms that regulate Vegfr1 expression are largely unknown. Our earlier studies with mouse yolk sac endothelial cells (YSECs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) showed that Vegfr1 transcription is highly induced in endothelial cells in response to angiogenic signals mediated by a growth supplement containing FGF2 and EGF (15.Pal S. Wu J. Murray J.K. Gellman S.H. Wozniak M.A. Keely P.J. Boyer M.E. Gomez T.M. Hasso S.M. Fallon J.F. Bresnick E.H. J.

Chem. 2008; 283: 25404-25413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We also showed that transcription factors ETS1 and hypoxia-inducible factor 2α function in a combinatorial fashion to directly mediate the transcriptional induction of Vegfr1 in endothelial cells (16.Dutta D. Ray S. Vivian J.L. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25404-25413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the role of chromatin-associated mechanisms like the importance of a specific histone modification in the transcriptional regulation of Vegfr1 or other key angiogenic genes has never been addressed. Alteration of histone acetylation at chromatin domains is one of the key regulatory mechanisms associated with transcriptional activation (17.Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Changes in histone acetylation levels modulate higher order chromatin structure and transcription factor/cofactors recruitment at the chromatin domains, thereby altering the gene activity and cellular processes (18.Shahbazian M.D. Grunstein M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Whereas most of the known acetylation sites of histone H3 are at the N-terminal tail, the Lys-56 residue of histone H3 is located within the α-N helical region near the entry-exit sites of the DNA superhelix (19.Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Cell. 2005; 121: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 20.Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Thus, the acetylation of Lys-56 residue probably affects the nucleosome structure itself and unfolds the chromatin. Although most of the studies regarding Lys-56 acetylation have been done in yeast, recent studies showed that Lys-56 acetylation also exists in human cells (21.Xie W. Song C. Young N.L. Sperling A.S. Xu F. Sridharan R. Conway A.E. Garcia B.A. Plath K. Clark A.T. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 417-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and is highly induced in multiple cancers (22.Das C. Lucia M.S. Hansen K.C. Tyler J.K. Nature. 2009; 459: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis in human embryonic stem cells showed that Lys-56 acetylation is largely associated with transcriptionally active loci in embryonic stem cells and is highly induced at developmental regulator genes during embryonic stem cell differentiation (21.Xie W. Song C. Young N.L. Sperling A.S. Xu F. Sridharan R. Conway A.E. Garcia B.A. Plath K. Clark A.T. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 417-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In yeast, Lys-56 acetylation is mediated by histone transferases Rtt109 and Spt10 in global or promoter-specific manner, respectively (19.Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Cell. 2005; 121: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 23.Schneider J. Bajwa P. Johnson F.C. Bhaumik S.R. Shilatifard A. J. Biol.

However, in higher eukaryotes, histone acetyl transferase CBP is implicated in mediating H3K56 acetylation (22.Das C. Lucia M.S. Hansen K.C. Tyler J.K. Nature. 2009; 459: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). In addition, the function of histone chaperone anti-silencing function 1A (ASF1a) is also implicated in H3K56 acetylation in vivo (22.Das C. Lucia M.S. Hansen K.C. Tyler J.K. Nature. 2009; 459: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). It is also shown that, in human cells, along with ASF1a, function of another histone chaperone, chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF1), is important to incorporate H3acK56 into the chromatin following DNA damage (22.Das C. Lucia M.S. Hansen K.C. Tyler J.K. Nature. 2009; 459: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Histone chaperones are important during the process of histone transfer into the chromatin (26.De Koning L. Corpet A. Haber J.E. Almouzni G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In mammals, the function of histone chaperones ASF1a/b, CAF1, and HIRA are implicated in the exchange of histone H3. ASF1 is involved in both replication-dependent and -independent H3 exchange (27.Rufiange A. Jacques P.E. Bhat W. Robert F. Nourani A. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 393-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 28.English C.M. Adkins M.W. Carson J.J. Churchill M.E. Tyler J.K. Cell. 2006; 127: 495-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and CAF1 is involved in replication-dependent histone H3/H4 exchange (29.Li Q. Zhou H. Wurtele H. Davies B. Horazdovsky B. Verreault A. Zhang Z. Cell. 2008; 134: 244-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 30.Ransom M. Dennehey B.K. Tyler J.K. Cell. 2010; 140: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HIRA is involved only in the replication-independent histone H3/H4 exchange (31.Green E.M. Antczak A.J. Bailey A.O. Franco A.A. Wu K.J. Yates 3rd, J.R. Kaufman P.D. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2044-2049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 32.Ray-Gallet D. Quivy J.P. Scamps C. Martini E.M. Lipinski M. Almouzni G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Elegant molecular analysis showed that CAF1 and HIRA have specificity for different histone variants. CAF1 associates with histone H3 variant, H3.1, whereas HIRA interacts with histone H3.3, which is mainly associated with the transcriptionally active chromatin regions (33.Tagami H. Ray-Gallet D. Almouzni G. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2004; 116: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 34.Kim H.J. Seol J.H. Han J.W. Youn H.D. Cho E.J.

A genome-wide study in mouse embryonic stem cells indicated that HIRA is required for the enrichment of H3.3 at the transcriptional start site of active genes as well as repressed but transcriptionally poised developmental regulator genes (37.Goldberg A.D. Banaszynski L.A. Noh K.M. Lewis P.W. Elsaesser S.J. Stadler S. Dewell S. Law M. Guo X. Li X. Wen D. Chapgier A. DeKelver R.C. Miller J.C. Lee Y.L. Boydston E.A. Holmes M.C. Gregory P.D. Greally J.M.

Cell. 2010; 140: 678-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Interestingly recent studies also showed that at least two different proteins, death domain-associated protein DAXX and the chromatin remodeling factor ATRX, could mediate HIRA-independent histone H3.3 deposition in mammalian cells in a replication-independent manner (37.Goldberg A.D. Banaszynski L.A. Noh K.M. Lewis P.W. Elsaesser S.J. Stadler S. Dewell S. Law M. Guo X. Li X. Wen D. Chapgier A. DeKelver R.C. Miller J.C. Lee Y.L. Boydston E.A. Holmes M.C. Gregory P.D. Greally J.M.

Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 1253-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), indicating that multiple pathways are involved in the assembly of H3.3 nucleosomes. However, the importance of HIRA during mammalian development is evident from the targeted mutagenesis study in mouse (39.Roberts C. Sutherland H.F. Farmer H. Kimber W. Halford S. Carey A. Brickman J.M. Wynshaw-Boris A. Scambler P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2318-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Hira−/− mice die between embryonic days 10 and 11 and are characterized with wide range of phenotypes caused by defective mesendodermal development. However, endothelial cell-specific function of HIRA or the role of HIRA in postnatal angiogenesis has never been addressed. To understand the transcriptional mechanisms during angiogenesis, we asked whether H3K56 acetylation and the associated molecular mechanisms are involved in endothelial gene regulation. Here, we report that, in response to angiogenic signals, H3K56 acetylation is induced within endothelial cells, and H3acK56 is incorporated at the chromatin domains of Vegfr1 and other angiogenic genes that are transcriptionally induced by angiogenic signals. We show that chromatin incorporation of H3acK56 during transcriptional induction of several angiogenic genes occurs via a HIRA-mediated histone H3 exchange, in which HIRA incorporates Lys-56 acetylated H3.3 molecules at the chromatin domains. In addition, our functional analyses revealed that HIRA function is important for vascular network formation by endothelial cells and pathological angiogenesis. Our analyses unfold a novel HIRA-dependent transcriptional mechanism that is important for endothelial gene activation and angiogenesis. YSECs and HUVECs were maintained in medium 200 (M200; Invitrogen) as described earlier (15.Pal S. Wu J. Murray J.K. Gellman S.H. Wozniak M.A. Keely P.J. Boyer M.E. Gomez T.M. Hasso S.M. Fallon J.F.

Chem. 2008; 283: 25404-25413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For regular maintenance (used as control), the cells were cultured in M200, supplemented with an endothelial growth supplement (Invitrogen) containing FGF2 (3 ng/ml), EGF (10 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml), and heparin (10 μg/ml) along with FBS (final concentration, 2%). For starvation, the cells were cultured overnight in M200 without supplement. For experiments with FGF2/EGF condition, FGF2 (3 ng/ml) and EGF (10 ng/ml) were added to the starved endothelial cells. Bovine retinal microvascular endothelial cells (BRMVEC) were obtained from VEC Technologies, Inc. (Rensselaer, NY) and were maintained in MCDB-131 (Sigma-Aldrich; M8537) on fibronectin (Sigma; F1141). During experiments, starved BRMVECs were treated with FGF2/EGF containing M200. HEK-293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlas Biologicals, Fort Collins, CO). Plasmids containing FLAG-H3.1 or FLAG-H3.3 were transfected into YSECs by nucleofection using an Amaxa nucleofector. To isolate mouse choroidal endothelial cells, eyes from 4-week-old mice were enucleated, and all connective tissue, muscle, the cornea, lens, vitreous, and retina were removed. The remaining tissue was digested with collagenase type I, The cell suspension was centrifuged, washed, and incubated with magnetic beads (Invitrogen) precoated with anti-PECAM-1, as described previously (40.Su X. Sorenson C.M. Sheibani N. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 171-178PubMed Google Scholar). The choroidal endothelial cells were collected by using a magnet and cultured on a fibronectin-coated plate in DMEM containing 10% FBS, endothelial growth supplement 100 μg/ml (Sigma), and murine recombinant interferon-γ (R & D, Minneapolis, MN) at 44 units/ml. RNA was extracted from different cell samples with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared by annealing RNA (1 μg) with 250 ng of a 5:1 mixture of random and oligo(dT) primers heated at 68 °C for 10 min. This was followed by incubation with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (50 units) (Invitrogen) combined with 10 mm dithiothreitol, RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), and 0.5 mm dNTPs at 42 °C for 1 h. The reactions were diluted to a final volume of 100 μl and heat-inactivated at 97 °C for 5 min. 20-μl PCRs contained 2 μl of cDNA, 10 μl of SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and corresponding primer sets. Control reactions lacking RT yielded very low signals. Oligonucleotides used for of RT-PCR analyses are mentioned in supplemental Table S1. Cell lysates were prepared in SDS gel loading buffer and resolved by 8, 10, or 12% PAGE. Monoclonal anti-VEGFR1 (ab32152), HIRA (ab20655), and rabbit polyclonal to DDDk tag (anti-FLAG, ab1162) were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Anti-H3acK56 rabbit monoclonal antibody (2134-1) was purchased from Epitomics (Burlingame, CA). Anti-CAF-1p150 (sc-10772) and anti-CBP (sc-369) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Asf1A (#2990) and anti-histone H3 (9715) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, and monoclonal anti-β-actin (A5441) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used as secondary antibodies. Immunostaining of H3acK56 in YSECs was performed using standard protocols. Briefly, YSECs were fixed with 100% methanol washed three times with PBS (Ca/Mg free) at room temperature. Blocking of nonspecific binding sites in the cells was performed by adding goat serum (Invitrogen; 50-062Z) for 30 min. The cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody. After primary antibody incubation, each well was rinsed with blocking solution. Fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor® 488; Molecular Probes and Invitrogen) were used at 1:250 dilution in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Each well was washed thrice with PBS for 10 min. After adding anti-fade mounting medium, the images were captured using a Leica fluorescence microscope. In 96-well plate, YSECs and HIRA knocked down YSECs were seeded (5000 cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C for different time intervals in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. 20 μl of CellTiter 96AQueous One Solution Reagent (#G3582; Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h. The absorbance of soluble formazon produced by cellular reduction of MTS was recorded at 490 nm using a 96-well plate reader. Lentiviral vectors containing shRNAs targeting mouse Hira, Caf1p150 (Chaf1a), and CBP mRNAs were cloned in pLKO1 (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL). Lentiviral supernatants were produced in HEK-293T cells, and YSECs were transduced following methods described earlier (41.Home P. Ray S. Dutta D. Bronshteyn I. Larson M. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28729-28737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Constructs with five different target sequences for Hira (Open Biosystems; RMM4534-NM_010435) were used, and clone TRCN0000081954 (CAGCTTTCCACAGCTGTTAT) effectively knocked down the Hira mRNA levels by ∼65%. Clone TRCN0000081956 with Hira target sequence CCACTGCTCAGATCATCGAAA did not show any knockdown activity and used as an inactive Hira shRNA control for different experiments. Two different shRNA constructs with target sequences (GAGGCTGCAGACCACACGA, CBP shRNA1; and AATAGTAACTCTGGCCATAGC, CBP shRNA2) were used to knock down CBP expression in YSECs. The CBP shRNA1 and CBP shRNA2 reduced the CBP mRNA levels by ∼85 and ∼40%, respectively. shRNA construct with target sequence (AAAGACAGACCCGGGTTCCCA) effectively knocked down Chaf1a (CAF1 p150) mRNA expression. Real time PCR-based quantitative ChIP analysis was performed according to an earlier described protocol (41.Home P. Ray S. Dutta D. Bronshteyn I. Larson M. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28729-28737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The cells were trypsinized, cross-linked with formaldehyde (1%), and sonicated to generate chromatin fragments. Antibodies against H3acK56, histone H3, and FLAG epitope were used to immunoprecipitate protein-DNA cross-linked fragments. Precipitated complexes were eluted and reverse cross-linked except for those that are used for sequential ChIP. Enrichment of chromatin fragments was measured by quantitative PCR using SYBR green (Applied Biosystems) fluorescence relative to a standard curve of input chromatin. The primer sequences are included in supplemental Table S1. For sequential ChIP assay, chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated with anti-H3acK56 antibody, and after elution, samples were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody for 90 min at room temperature in the presence of 50 μg/ml yeast tRNA and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose following a protocol described previously (42.Geisberg J.V. Struhl K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e151Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). RT2Profiler™ PCR Array of mouse and human angiogenesis (PAMM-024A and PAHS-024A, respectively) were purchased from SA Biosciences (Frederick, MD). cDNAs were prepared from DNase I-treated RNA samples isolated from starved and supplement-treated YSECs and HUVECs. Fold change was calculated using Ct values and validated using specific RT primers. Three individual experiments were performed for both YSECs and HUVECs, and the average changes in the expression levels are shown in supplemental Table S2. Endothelial network assembly was assayed by formation of capillary like structures by YSECs on Matrigel (BD Biosciences; 354234). Matrigel was diluted 1:1 with supplement-free M200 medium, poured in 12-well plates, and allowed to solidify at 37 °C. Subconfluent control and HIRA knocked down (HIRAkd) YSECs were harvested and preincubated for 1 h in growth supplement-free M200 medium in microcentrifuge tubes. An equal volume of M200 medium containing FGF2/EGF were added. The cells were plated on Matrigel (1.5 × 105 cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C and photographed at different time intervals. For Matrigel plug assay, growth factor reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences; 356231) in combination with 500 ng/ml of FGF2 and lentiviral particles having shRNAs against HIRA were mixed. 300 μl of the Matrigel mix were injected subcutaneously into the abdominal region of female CD1 mice. Matrigel plugs were harvested after day 9, photographed, fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, and paraffin-embedded for hematoxylin and eosin staining. Approximately 5–6-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and kept for a few days before the start of the experiment. CNV was induced by laser photocoagulation-induced rupture of Bruch's membrane on day 0. The mice were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg), and the pupils were dilated. Laser photocoagulation (75-μm spot size, 0.1-s duration, 120 milliwatt) was performed in the 9, 12, and 3 o'clock positions of the posterior pole of each eye with the slit lamp delivery system of an OcuLight GL diode laser (Iridex, Mountain View, CA) and a handheld coverslip as a contact lens to view the retina (43.Umeda N.

Following lasering, the animals were divided into three groups. Group1 was untreated and used as controls. Groups 2 and 3 were subjected to intravitreous injections with lentiviral particles containing inactive and active HIRA shRNA, respectively. Intravitreous injections were done under dissecting microscope with a Harvard Pump Microinjection system and pulled glass micropipettes on the day of lasering and 3 days later, as described previously (44.Mori K.

Given the role of RGS6 as a G protein GAP, the link between G protein activation and cancer, and a reduction of cancer risk in humans expressing a RGS6 SNP leading to its increased translation, we hypothesized that RGS6 might function to inhibit growth of cancer cells. Here, we show a marked down-regulation of RGS6 in human mammary ductal epithelial cells that correlates with the progression of their transformation. RGS6 exhibited impressive antiproliferative actions in breast cancer cells, including inhibition of cell growth and colony formation and induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by mechanisms independent of p53. RGS6 activated the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis involving regulation of Bax/Bcl-2, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), cytochrome c release, activation of caspases-3 and -9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. RGS6 promoted loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS). RGS6-induced caspase activation and loss of ΔΨm was mediated by ROS, suggesting an amplification loop in which ROS provided a feed forward signal to induce MOMP, caspase activation, and cell death. Loss of RGS6 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts dramatically impaired doxorubicin-induced growth suppression and apoptosis. Surprisingly, RGS6-induced apoptosis in both breast cancer cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts does not require its GAP activity toward G proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2028113457,"Thrombomodulin (TM) is a cofactor for thrombin-mediated activation of protein C and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) and thereby helps coordinate coagulation, anticoagulation, fibrinolysis, and inflammation. Platelet factor 4 (PF4), a platelet α-granule protein and a soluble cofactor for TM-dependent protein C activation, stimulates protein C activation in vitro and in vivo. In contrast to stimulation of protein C activation, PF4 is shown here to inhibit activation of TAFI by thrombin-TM. Consequences of inhibition of TAFI activation by PF4 included loss of TM-dependent prolongation of clot lysis times in hemophilia A plasma and loss of TM-stimulated conversion of bradykinin (BK) to des-Arg(9)-BK by TAFIa in normal plasma. Thus, PF4 modulates the substrate specificity of the thrombin-TM complex by selectively enhancing protein C activation while inhibiting TAFI activation, thereby preventing the generation of the antifibrinolytic and anti-inflammatory activities of TAFIa. To block the inhibitory effects of PF4 on TAFI activation, heparin derivatives were tested for their ability to retain high affinity binding to PF4 despite having greatly diminished anticoagulant activity. N-acetylated heparin (NAc-Hep) lacked detectable anticoagulant activity in activated partial thromboplastin time clotting assays but retained high affinity binding to PF4 and effectively reversed PF4 binding to immobilized TM. NAc-Hep permitted BK conversion to des-Arg(9)-BK by TAFIa in the presence of PF4. In a clot lysis assay on TM-expressing cells using hemophilia A plasma, NAc-Hep prevented PF4-mediated inhibition of TAFI activation and the antifibrinolytic functions of TAFIa. Accordingly, NAc-Hep or similar heparin derivatives might provide therapeutic benefits by diminishing bleeding complications in hemophilia A via restoration of TAFIa-mediated protection of clots against premature lysis."

Recent findings demonstrate that the naive and primed pluripotent states are interconvertible, even in human cells, and hint that growth factor-mediated Nanog expression may be an important factor regulating the balance between them. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have been classified into two distinct states: a primitive, naive LIF-dependent state represented by murine ESCs, and a primed bFGF-dependent state observed in murine and rat epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs).

Recent findings demonstrate that the naive and primed pluripotent states are interconvertible, even in human cells, and hint that growth factor-mediated Nanog expression may be an important factor regulating the balance between them. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are pluripotent stem cells derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of the preimplantation blastocyst, which have the ability to generate all three germ layers, ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm (Yu and Thomson, 2008Yu J. Thomson J.A. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). ESCs have been derived from both murine and human blastocysts, but curiously, ESC lines from these two species display profound differences in colony morphology, proliferation rate, growth factor requirements, and epigenetic status (Table 1). Murine ESCs grow in three-dimensional, tightly packed colonies with a population doubling time of approximately 16 hr and require LIF and BMP4 growth factor signaling for their continued self-renewal. In contrast, human ESCs form flattened two-dimensional colonies and are maintained in a bFGF and ActivinA/TGF-β signaling-dependent manner. Human ESCs proliferate slowly, with a population doubling time averaging 36 hr. Epigenetically, human and murine ESCs display a different pattern of X chromosome inactivation and promoter occupancy by pluripotency transcription factors (Hanna et al., 2009Hanna J. Markoulaki S.

In addition, cultures of human ESCs are split by mechanical- or collagenase-mediated passaging as small clusters of cells, and unlike murine ESCs, most human ESC lines cannot be passaged as single cells by trypsin digest (Yu and Thomson, 2008Yu J. Thomson J.A. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).

This view was challenged by the derivation of so-called epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) from explanted murine or rat postimplantation epiblasts. EpiSCs demonstrate striking similarities to hESCs with regard to their molecular properties, growth factor requirements, colony morphology, X-inactivation status, and culture dynamics (Tesar et al., 2007Tesar P.J.

Development. 2009; 136: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that in the mouse, two functionally distinct pluripotent states exist: a “naive” LIF-dependent pluripotent stem cell (PSC) state that is compatible with the preimplantation ICM and a “primed” bFGF-dependent PSC state that is reminiscent of the postimplantation epiblast (Nichols and Smith, 2009Nichols J. Smith A. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 487-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). The naive pluripotent state represents a more primitive stem cell population than the primed PSCs, in that they are uniquely capable of integrating with the blastocyst ICM and contribute to chimera formation. In addition, naive PSCs exhibit a more open chromatin structure, as demonstrated by the lack of X-inactivation (Hanna et al., 2010Hanna J. Cheng A.W. Saha K. Kim J. Lengner C.J. Soldner F. Cassady J.P. Muffat J. Carey B.W. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 9222-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In accordance with this notion, EpiSCs fail to integrate into the preimplantation blastocyst and rarely contribute to chimera formation (Tesar et al., 2007Tesar P.J. Chenoweth J.G. Brook F.A. Davies T.J. Evans E.P. Mack D.L. Gardner R.L. McKay R.D.G. Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). The strong observed overlap of the key characteristics of EpiSCs and human ESCs suggest that despite their blastocyst origin, human ESCs exist in a primed pluripotent state. It has been argued that the blastocyst origin of human ESCs is evidenced by their expression of Rex1 (Zfp42), known to be a specific marker of the ICM in murine embryos. However, the ICM specificity of this marker has not been established for the human embryo. Molecular examination of blastocysts across different species, including humans, demonstrates that a wide variation exists in the developmental timing of the expression of early regulators of embryonic development such as Oct4 and Cdx2 (Kuijk et al., 2008Kuijk E.W. Du Puy L. Van Tol H.T.A. Oei C.H.Y. Haagsman H.P. Colenbrander B. Roelen B.A.J. Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 918-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, Pant and Keefer, 2009Pant D. Keefer C.L.

Eggan K. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 103-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is possible that in human development, Rex1 expression is similarly extended into the early postimplantation epiblast, explaining its expression in human ESCs and iPSCs. The naive murine PSC state is maintained by an intricate balance between LIF and BMP4 growth factor signals. LIF activates three distinct intracellular signaling pathways: the Jak/Stat3 and PI(3)K/Akt pathways that stimulate self renewal and the MEK/ERK pathway that drives mESC differentiation (Figure 1; Niwa et al., 2009Niwa H. Ogawa K. Shimosato D. Adachi K. Nature. 2009; 460: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, Hamazaki et al., 2006Hamazaki T. Kehoe S.M. Nakano T. Terada N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7539-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). BMP4 serves to inhibit this differentiation-inducing effect of the MEK/ERK pathway through upregulation of Inhibitor of Differentiation (Id) proteins (Ying et al., 2003Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that in naive murine PSCs, pluripotency is maintained by cross-inhibition of differentiation signals downstream of the LIF and BMP4 receptors. In line with this idea, Ying and colleagues demonstrated that mESCs can be maintained in the absence of ectopic signals when intracellular differentiation inducing signals are eliminated. Simultaneous inhibition of the FGF receptor tyrosine kinase, MEK/ERK signaling, and GSK3β, the so-called 3i culture regime, are able to sustain LIF-independent growth and self-renewal of mESCs (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2309) Google Scholar), demonstrating that in the absence of differentiation cues, mESC self-renewal prevails over differentiation. The primed pluripotent stem cell state is maintained by a combination of ActivinA/TGF-β and bFGF signaling. The ActivinA/TGF-β pathway leads to activation of SMAD2/3, which is a direct upstream inducer of NANOG expression (Figure 1; Xu et al., 2008Xu R.H. Sampsell-Barron T.L. Gu F. Root S. Peck R.M. Pan G. Yu J. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. Tian S. Stewart R. Thomson J.A. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 196-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, Vallier et al., 2009Vallier L. Mendjan S. Brown S. Chng Z. Teo A. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W.B. Cho C.H. Martinez A. Rugg-Gunn P. et al.Development. 2009; 136: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The function of the bFGF signaling pathway is less clear and may be divergent between hESCs and murine EpiSCs. In human ESCs, bFGF inhibits neural development and cooperates with SMAD2/3 to maintain NANOG expression, whereas in murine EpiSCs, bFGF was not observed to have a stimulatory effect on Nanog expression (Greber et al., 2010Greber B. Wu G. Bernemann C. Joo J.Y. Han D.W. Ko K. Tapia N. Sabour D. Sterneckert J. Tesar P. Schöler H.R. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 215-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Importantly, and in support of the model that naive and primed states represent different “flavors” of pluripotency, naive and primed cells are readily interconvertible. For example, naive mESCs adopt a primed EpiSC state upon a simple growth factor switch to bFGF/ActivinA (Guo et al., 2009Guo G. Yang J. Nichols J. Hall J.S. Eyres I. Mansfield W. Smith A. Development. 2009; 136: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The conversion of primed PSCs to the naive pluripotent state is less efficient but can be facilitated by the overexpression of Klf4, Klf2, Nanog, or Nr5a (Guo et al., 2009Guo G. Yang J. Nichols J. Hall J.S. Eyres I. Mansfield W. Smith A. Development. 2009; 136: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, Guo and Smith, 2010Guo G. Smith A.

Smith A. Cell. 2009; 138: 722-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). In addition, Bao and colleagues demonstrated that EpiSCs can also revert to ESC-like cells (rESCs) upon prolonged passaging of the stem cells in the presence of LIF and selection for cells that express the germ cell-specific marker Stella (Dppa3) (Bao et al., 2009Bao S. Tang F. Li X. Hayashi K. Gillich A. Lao K. Surani M.A. Nature. 2009; 461: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, this growth factor-mediated conversion of EpiSCs to rESCs may be indirect. With the same Stella-GFP reporter cell line, Hayashi and colleagues recently demonstrated that EpiSCs can form primordial germ cells (PGCs) in vitro (Hayashi and Surani, 2009Hayashi K. Surani M.A. Development. 2009; 136: 3549-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). PGCs can give rise to embryonic germ cells (EGCs) that are nearly indistinguishable from ESCs, so it is possible that the rESCs reported by Bao and colleagues are in fact EGCs derived from intermediate PGCs (Bao et al., 2009Bao S. Tang F. Li X. Hayashi K. Gillich A. Lao K. Surani M.A. Nature. 2009; 461: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, Guo and Smith, 2010Guo G. Smith A. Development. 2010; 137: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Whether indirect or not, it is clear that LIF signaling plays an active role in the EpiSC to rESC conversion. Whereas the 3i regime can support the maintenance of naive murine PSCs, the conversion of murine EpiSCs into rESCs is impaired in the absence of LIF signaling (Yang et al., 2010Yang J. van Oosten A.L. Theunissen T.W. Guo G. Silva J.C.R. Smith A. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 319-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of constitutively active Stat3 restored the EpiSC to rESC conversion, demonstrating that this pathway plays a critical role in establishing the naive pluripotent state (Yang et al., 2010Yang J. van Oosten A.L. Theunissen T.W. Guo G. Silva J.C.R. Smith A. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 319-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Curiously, the naive PSC state is only maintained in lines derived from a limited set of “permissive” inbred mouse strains. Until recently, naive PSC lines could not be derived from nonpermissive mouse strains such as the widely used nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. This limitation severely hampered the development of novel genetic models in these backgrounds. Hanna and colleagues demonstrated that in nonpermissive genetic backgrounds, the naive PSC state depends on the continued presence of exogenous factors, either the constitutive expression of ectopic reprogramming factors (Klf4 or cMyc) or the presence of small molecule inhibitors of the GSK3β and MEK/ERK signaling pathways (Hanna et al., 2009Hanna J. Markoulaki S. Mitalipova M. Cheng A.W. Cassady J.P. Staerk J. Carey B.W. Lengner C.J. Foreman R. Love J. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 513-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), so-called 2i+LIF conditions. Upon withdrawal of these exogenous factors, the nonpermissive naive PSCs rapidly differentiate. Similar strategies allowed the derivation of naive PSCs from the rat either by ectopic expression of all four reprogramming factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc (Liao et al., 2009Liao J. Cui C. Chen S. Ren J. Chen J. Gao Y. Li H. Jia N. Cheng L. Xiao H. Xiao L. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 11-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), or by using a chemical inhibitor cocktail in the form of 3i or 2i+LIF (Buehr et al., 2008Buehr M. Meek S. Blair K. Yang J. Ure J. Silva J. McLay R. Hall J. Ying Q.L. Smith A. Cell. 2008; 135: 1287-1298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Importantly, naive rat PSCs were shown to be amenable to homologous recombination and allowed the generation of knockout rats (Tong et al., 2010Tong C. Li P. Wu N.L. Yan Y. Ying Q.L. Nature. 2010; 467: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the naive PSC state offers functional advantages over primed PSCs. The results discussed above demonstrate that the naive pluripotent state is not restricted to murine PSCs but requires the stabilization by exogenous factors in order to be maintained in other species. Three recent reports suggest that alternative states exist for human PSCs as well. Li and colleagues demonstrated that human iPSCs could be derived in the presence of 2i+LIF (Li et al., 2009Li W. Wei W. Zhu S. Zhu J. Shi Y. Lin T. Hao E. Hayek A. Deng H. Ding S. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 16-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In these conditions, the human iPSCs adopt murine ESC-like colony morphology and are propagated as single cells by trypsin digest. However, the molecular and functional properties of the cells were not reported and their cell-surface marker profile suggests that the cells retain a degree of similarity to “traditional” primed human iPSCs. More recently, our lab demonstrated that reprogramming of somatic cells via Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, and Nanog under naive growth factor conditions results in cells termed hLR5 (human, LIF, and 5 reprogramming factors) that resemble murine ESCs with regard to their colony morphology, culture dynamics, and certain molecular properties (Buecker et al., 2010Buecker C. Chen H.H. Polo J.M. Daheron L. Bu L. Barakat T.S. Okwieka P. Porter A. Gribnau J. Hochedlinger K. Geijsen N. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 535-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Maintenance of the hLR5 state depends on the continued expression of ectopic reprogramming factors. Furthermore, hLR5 cells did not form differentiated derivatives and are therefore strictly speaking not pluripotent. However, hLR5 cells convert to a stable primed pluripotent state when switched to “standard” bFGF culture conditions. Importantly, hLR5 cells allow efficient homologous recombination-mediated gene targeting via standard protocols that are routinely used for murine ESCs and can thus serve as a powerful intermediate for the genetic manipulation of human PSCs. With a similar approach, Hanna and colleagues derived naive human PSCs by combining ectopic expression of Oct4 and Klf4 or Klf4 and Klf2 with small molecule inhibitors of GSK3β and MEK/ERK (Hanna et al., 2010Hanna J. Cheng A.W. Saha K. Kim J. Lengner C.J. Soldner F. Cassady J.P. Muffat J. Carey B.W. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 9222-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Importantly, the authors demonstrated that forskolin, an agonist of the Protein Kinase A pathway, can transiently replace the need for ectopic reprogramming factors. Interestingly, forskolin is also used for the derivation of embryonic germ cell lines from embryonic gonads, suggesting a close relationship between naive pluripotency and the germline. Indeed, the expression of germ cell-specific genes appears to be a hallmark property of naive PSCs (Chou et al., 2008Chou Y.F. Chen H.H. Eijpe M. Yabuuchi A. Chenoweth J.G. Tesar P. Lu J. McKay R.D.G. Geijsen N. Cell. 2008; 135: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, Tesar et al., 2007Tesar P.J. Chenoweth J.G. Brook F.A. Davies T.J. Evans E.P.

In the absence of ectopic reprogramming factors, the maintenance of human naive LIF-dependent PSCs is limited to approximately 15 passages. Taken together, these combined results suggest that a naive LIF-dependent pluripotent state can exist in multiple species, including humans. The specific growth factor conditions that maintain this state in the absence of ectopic reprogramming factors or small molecule inhibitors remain poorly understood. The transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog are at the heart of the stem cell transcriptional pluripotency network and together maintain pluripotency (reviewed in Barrero et al., 2010Barrero M.H. Boué S. Izpisúa Belmonte J.C. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7 (this issue): 565-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, Cole and Young, 2008Cole M.F. Young R.A.

Development. 2009; 136: 2311-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). So how can two distinct sets of growth factors (LIF and Bmp4 versus bFGF and ActivinA) signal to define and maintain two discrete pluripotent states via the same transcriptional regulators of pluripotency, Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog? Of the three core factors, only Nanog has been shown to be a downstream target of both sets of growth factor pathways and thus Nanog is an attractive candidate as a key regulator of the pluripotent stem cell state. Nanog was first described by two independent groups in a screen for genes that can bestow LIF-independent growth on mESCs (Chambers et al., 2003Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar, Mitsui et al., 2003Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2453) Google Scholar). Nanog knockout studies demonstrated that although Nanog is not required for maintaining pluripotency, Nanog−/− ESCs are more prone to differentiation (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). In addition, in the absence of Nanog, the derivation of naive PSCs is impaired, demonstrating that Nanog plays an important role in establishing a pluripotent state (Silva et al., 2009Silva J. Nichols J. Theunissen T.W. Guo G. van Oosten A.L. Barrandon O. Wray J. Yamanaka S. Chambers I. Smith A. Cell. 2009; 138: 722-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Several signaling pathways emanating from the LIF and ActivinA/TGF-β receptors were recently shown to regulate Nanog expression. Niwa et al. demonstrated that in mESCs, LIF-induced activation of PI(3)K/AKT induces T-Box 3 (Tbx3) expression, which in turn activates Nanog transcription (Figure 1; Niwa et al., 2009Niwa H. Ogawa K. Shimosato D. Adachi K. Nature. 2009; 460: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In addition, parallel activation of the Jak/Stat3 pathway induces Klf4 expression, which binds to the Nanog promotor and further simulates Nanog expression (Niwa et al., 2009Niwa H. Ogawa K. Shimosato D. Adachi K. Nature. 2009; 460: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2010Zhang P. Andrianakos R. Yang Y. Liu C. Lu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9180-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Xu and colleagues discovered SMAD2/3 binding sites in the human Nanog promotor, suggesting a direct effect of ActivinA/TGF-β signaling on Nanog expression in human ESCs. Indeed, ActivinA stimulation of human ESCs leads to enhanced activity of the Nanog promoter, whereas mutations of the SMAD2/3 binding sites abrogate this responsiveness (Figure 1; Xu et al., 2008Xu R.H. Sampsell-Barron T.L. Gu F. Root S. Peck R.M. Pan G. Yu J. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. Tian S. Stewart R. Thomson J.A. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 196-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Nanog expression levels are heterogeneous within a mESC colony and heterogeneity is reestablished when Nanog-GFP mESCs are sorted into Nanoghigh and Nanoglow subpopulations (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, Kalmar et al., 2009Kalmar T. Lim C. Hayward P. Muñoz-Descalzo S. Nichols J. Garcia-Ojalvo J. Martinez Arias A. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000149Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The percentage of Nanoghigh cells is greatly increased under 3i culture conditions, demonstrating that high Nanog expression levels are closely linked to the inhibitor-enforced naive ESC state (Wray et al., 2010Wray J. Kalkan T. Smith A.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2010; 38: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In contrast, Nanoglow cells within the ESC culture are more prone to differentiation, suggesting that low Nanog levels lead to a more primed pluripotent state (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpression of Nanog facilitates the LIF-mediated conversion of EpiSCs into mESCs (Silva et al., 2009Silva J. Nichols J. Theunissen T.W. Guo G. van Oosten A.L. Barrandon O. Wray J. Yamanaka S. Chambers I. Smith A. Cell. 2009; 138: 722-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). These combined data suggest that the different sets of exogenous growth factors that support naive and primed PSCs promote a particular pluripotent state by maintaining different levels of Nanog expression. The recent generation of Nanog-GFP knockin human ESCs demonstrates that Nanog exhibits heterogeneous expression in human ESCs as well, but it remains to be analyzed whether similar functional differences exist between NANOGlow and NANOGhigh human ESCs (Fischer et al., 2010Fischer Y. Ganic E. Ameri J. Xian X. Johannesson M. Semb H. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e12533Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The above data suggest that in nonpermissive species, the naive pluripotent state is stabilized by the induction of Nanog expression, either by ectopic reprogramming factors or by small molecule inhibitors of differentiation. Indeed, Klf4 and/or Klf2 are upstream regulators of Nanog and are required to induce the transition of primed human PSCs to a naive pluripotent state (Hanna et al., 2010Hanna J. Cheng A.W. Saha K. Kim J. Lengner C.J. Soldner F. Cassady J.P. Muffat J. Carey B.W. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 9222-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In human PSCs, the combined inhibition of GSK3β and MEK/ERK is still insufficient to maintain the naive PSC state in the absence of ectopic reprogramming factors. However, the addition of forskolin, a PKA activator, allows the maintenance of naive iPSCs for up to 15 passages. PKA is commonly activated as a result of G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activation and concomitant elevation of intracellular cAMP levels. The role of GPCR signaling in PSC maintenance is not well understood, but two reports suggest that elevation of intracellular cAMP levels stabilizes Oct4 and Nanog expression and can delay mESC differentiation upon LIF withdrawal (Faherty et al., 2007Faherty S. Fitzgerald A. Keohan M. Quinlan L.R. Dev. Biol. Anim. 2007; 43: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, Layden et al., 2010Layden B.T. Newman M. Chen F. Fisher A. Lowe Jr., W.L. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e9105Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Considering how growth factor signals, reprogramming factor activity, and/or small molecule inhibitors seem to converge on Nanog, it seems reasonable to propose that additional growth factor signals that enhance Nanog expression levels may stabilize the naive human PSC state. Further exploration of the PKA signaling pathway, the identification of the relevant GPCR receptor and ligand, and the link between PKA signaling and Nanog expression may identify additional growth factor signals that sustain the stable, long-term propagation of naive human iPSCs and perhaps allow the derivation of naive human ESCs from blastocyst embryos. The naive human pluripotent state offers several advantages over existing human ESC and iPSC lines. Homologous recombination-mediated gene targeting is much enhanced in naive pluripotent stem cells, perhaps because of the more open chromatin structure of these cells (Hanna et al., 2009Hanna J. Markoulaki S. Mitalipova M. Cheng A.W. Cassady J.P. Staerk J. Carey B.W. Lengner C.J. Foreman R. Love J. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 513-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, Buecker et al., 2010Buecker C. Chen H.H. Polo J.M. Daheron L. Bu L. Barakat T.S.

Yan Y. Ying Q.L. Nature. 2010; 467: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As such, naive PSCs can enable the generation of mutant or transgenic human cell lines to model disease and development. In addition, the targeted correction of mutations in patient-derived naive iPSCs would be an elegant way to restore normal organ function in future cell therapies. Moreover, maintaining human PSCs in the naive pluripotent state may help eliminate the large variation in developmental propensity observed among primed human PSC lines and even within a single, heterogeneous cell line (Osafune et al., 2008Osafune K.

Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 263-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), increasing consistency in the results generated by different labs. Finally, naive pluripotent stem cells are uniquely able to integrate into the blastocyst ICM and functionally contribute to the developing embryo. Although no responsible group would propose to apply blastocyst complementation to developing human embryos, there are both basic and applied experimental settings that could eventually benefit from the unique functional properties of naive human PSCs. For example, in a series of elegant experiments, Kobayashi and colleagues recently demonstrated that naive rat pluripotent stem cells can integrate across species boundaries into mouse blastocyst embryos and form viable chimeras (Kobayashi et al., 2010Kobayashi T. Yamaguchi T. Hamanaka S. Kato Itoh M. Yamazaki Y. Ibata M. Sato H. Lee Y. Usui I. Knisely A.S. et al.Cell. 2010; 142: 787-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Although the overall percentage of rat cells contributing to the hybrid embryo was low, the rat donor cells were able to form an entire pancreas in recipient mouse embryos in which the pancreas was genetically ablated. Human ESCs have been injected into murine blastocysts in the past but did not significantly contribute to the developing embryo (James et al., 2006James D. Noggle S.A. Swigut T. Brivanlou A.H. Dev. Biol. 2006; 295: 90-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The above experiments with naive rat PSCs suggest that in the naive state, human PSCs may be developmentally compatible with blastocysts of other species. Such experiments will undoubtedly raise justifiable concerns and debate over the moral implications of cross-species chimeras (discussed in Solter, 2010Solter D. Cell. 2010; 142: 676-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, in the right genetic background and perhaps in a larger animal host such as the pig, cross-species chimeras may serve as a feasible approach for the generation of autologous human tissues for organ transplantation. In basic research, naive human PSCs will provide a critical tool to model the earliest steps in human embryonic development, as they are expected to be more closely related to the blastocyst ICM than current human ESC lines. Their unique primitive state will allow the study of critical epigenetic processes during early differentiation, such as, for example, X-inactivation. However, although initial attempts at deriving naive human iPSCs are promising, the culture (growth factor) conditions that support the long-term maintenance of these cells remain elusive. Ultimately, naive human ESCs will need to be generated from blastocyst embryos as well. Such experiments will raise ethical challenges of their own that should be subject to strict oversight. Nonetheless, it is clear that comparison studies regarding the functional behavior of embryo- and reprogramming-derived pluripotent cells from different species has been, and will continue to be, a valuable area of experimental inquiry.

https://openalex.org/W2080112888,"Regulation of progenitor cell fate determines the numbers of neurons in the developing brain. While proliferation of neural progenitors predominates during early central nervous system (CNS) development, progenitor cell fate shifts toward differentiation as CNS circuits develop, suggesting that signals from developing circuits may regulate proliferation and differentiation. We tested whether activity regulates neurogenesis in vivo in the developing visual system of Xenopus tadpoles. Both cell proliferation and the number of musashi1-immunoreactive progenitors in the optic tectum decrease as visual system connections become stronger. Visual deprivation for 2 days increased proliferation of musashi1-immunoreactive radial glial progenitors, while visual experience increased neuronal differentiation. Morpholino-mediated knockdown and overexpression of musashi1 indicate that musashi1 is necessary and sufficient for neural progenitor proliferation in the CNS. These data demonstrate a mechanism by which increased brain activity in developing circuits decreases cell proliferation and increases neuronal differentiation through the downregulation of musashi1 in response to circuit activity."

Here we report that inactivation of one copy of Grk5 gene in transgenic mice overexpressing β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) carrying Swedish mutations (Tg2576 or APPsw) resulted in significantly increased β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation, including increased Aβ+ plaque burdens and soluble Aβ in brain lysates and interstitial fluid (ISF). In addition, secreted β-APP fragment (sAPPβ) also increased, whereas full-length APP level did not change, suggesting an alteration in favor of β-amyloidogenic APP processing in these animals. Reversely, perfusion of methoctramine, a selective M2 antagonist, fully corrected the difference between the control and GRK5-deficient APPsw mice for ISF Aβ. In contrast, a cholinesterase inhibitor, eserine, although significantly decreasing the ISF Aβ in both control and GRK5-deficient APPsw mice, failed to correct the difference between them. However, combining eserine with methoctramine additively reduced the ISF Aβ further in both animals. Altogether, these findings indicate that GRK5 deficiency accelerates β-amyloidogenic APP processing and Aβ accumulation in APPsw mice via impaired cholinergic activity and that presynaptic M2 hyperactivity is the specific target for eliminating the pathologic impact of GRK5 deficiency.

https://openalex.org/W2006793254,"Like most metalloproteases, matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP-2) is synthesized as a zymogen. MMP-2 propeptide plays a role in inhibition of catalytic activity through a cysteine-zinc ion pairing, disruption of which results in full enzyme activation. A variety of proteases have been shown to be involved in the activation of pro-MMP-2, including metalloproteases and serine proteases. In the previous study we showed that MMP-2 activation occurred via specific cleavages of the propeptide by thrombin followed by intermolecular autoproteolytic processing for full enzymatic activity. Thrombin also degraded MMP-2, but this degradation was reduced greatly under cell-associated conditions with a concomitant increase in activation, prompting us to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying thrombin-mediated MMP-2 activation. In the present study we demonstrate that heparan sulfate is essential for thrombin-mediated activation of pro-MMP-2. Binding of heparan sulfate to thrombin is primarily responsible for this activation process, presumably through conformational changes at the active site. Furthermore, interaction of MMP-2 with exosites 1 and 2 of thrombin is crucial for thrombin-mediated MMP-2 degradation, and inhibition of this interaction by heparan sulfate or hirudin fragment results in a decrease in MMP-2 degradation. Finally, we demonstrated interaction between exosite 1 and hemopexin-like domain of MMP-2, suggesting a regulatory role of hemopexin-like domain in MMP-2 degradation. Taken together, our experimental data suggest a novel regulatory mechanism of thrombin-dependent MMP-2 enzymatic activity by heparan sulfate proteoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W2087196180,"G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels are parasympathetic effectors in cardiac myocytes that act as points of integration of signals from diverse pathways. Neurotransmitters and hormones acting on the Gq protein regulate GIRK channels by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) depletion. In previous studies, we found that endothelin-1, but not bradykinin, inhibited GIRK channels, even though both of them hydrolyze PIP2 in cardiac myocytes, showing receptor specificity. The present study assessed whether the spatial organization of the PIP2 signal into caveolar microdomains underlies the specificity of PIP2-mediated signaling. Using biochemical analysis, we examined the localization of GIRK and Gq protein-coupled receptors (GqPCRs) in mouse atrial myocytes. Agonist stimulation induced a transient co-localization of GIRK channels with endothelin receptors in the caveolae, excluding bradykinin receptors. Such redistribution was eliminated by caveolar disruption with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD). Patch clamp studies showed that the specific response of GIRK channels to GqPCR agonists was abolished by MβCD, indicating the functional significance of the caveolae-dependent spatial organization. To assess whether low PIP2 mobility is essential for PIP2-mediated signaling, we blocked the cytoskeletal restriction of PIP2 diffusion by latrunculin B. This abolished the GIRK channel regulation by GqPCRs without affecting their targeting to caveolae. These data suggest that without the hindered diffusion of PIP2 from microdomains, PIP2 loses its signaling efficacy. Taken together, these data suggest that specific targeting combined with restricted diffusion of PIP2 allows the PIP2 signal to be compartmentalized to the targets localized closely to the GqPCRs, enabling cells to discriminate between identical PIP2 signaling that is triggered by different receptors. G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels are parasympathetic effectors in cardiac myocytes that act as points of integration of signals from diverse pathways. Neurotransmitters and hormones acting on the Gq protein regulate GIRK channels by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) depletion.

IntroductionSeveral lines of evidence suggest that neurohormonal imbalance plays a role in the generation of atrial fibrillation (1.Chen P.S. Tan A.Y. Heart Rhythm. 2007; 4: S61-S64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Simultaneous sympathetic and parasympathetic (sympathovagal) activation facilitates the onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (2.Sharifov O.F. Fedorov V.V. Beloshapko G.G. Glukhov A.V.

The cardiovascular actions of native peptides and receptors showed a wide range of variety. Unlike ET-1 and angiotensin II, myocardial bradykinin (BK) might be a mechanism to protect the heart during acute myocardial infarction (5.Kitakaze M. Node K. Takashima S. Minamino T. Kuzuya T.

Physiol. 2000; 278: H1571-H1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The neurohormonal imbalances have seldom been sufficiently characterized to study their pathophysiology.One possible candidate for cross-talk for sympathovagal interaction and neurohormonal interaction in cardiac myocytes is the acetylcholine activated K+ (GIRK) channel. Recently, we and others found that α1-adrenergic receptor agonist inhibits GIRK channels by depleting PIP2 in the plasma membrane, indicating a novel pathway for sympathetic-parasympathetic interaction (7.Cho H.

ET-1 and angiotensin II can also regulate GIRK channel activity via PIP2 signaling (8.Meyer T. Wellner-Kienitz M.C. Biewald A. Bender K. Eickel A. Pott L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5650-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 9.Cho H. Lee D. Lee S.H. Ho W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4643-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, GIRK channels might act as points to integrate hormonal and neurotransmitter signals from diverse pathways. However, although GIRK channels are regulated by PIP2, they do not respond to PIP2 hydrolysis from stimulation of all Gq-coupled receptors. We found that BK had no effect on GIRK channels, although being capable of hydrolyzing PIP2 in cardiac myocytes (9.Cho H. Lee D. Lee S.H. Ho W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4643-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is possible that these selective responses could discriminate the beneficial effect associated with BK from other Gq protein-coupled receptor (GqPCR) pathways. Until now, the molecular mechanisms underlying receptor specificity have been mostly unknown.Several mechanisms were suggested to explain the receptor-specific and target-specific PIP2 signaling. One of those mechanisms is the PIP2 microdomain (10.Gamper N. Shapiro M.S. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this scenario, PIP2 abundance can change independently within a restricted area, so that the activation of a given GqPCR affects only those targets that are partitioned in the same microdomain. However, it is unclear whether and how PIP2-sensitive targets are co-localized with specific GqPCRs in atrial myocytes.Recent data showed that caveolae are important for co-localization of receptors with their signaling partners (11.Razani B. Woodman S.E. Lisanti M.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 431-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Caveolae are small invaginations of the plasma membranes, and caveolins are the main structural components of caveolae (12.Balijepalli R.C. Kamp T.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2008; 98: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13.Cohen A.W. Hnasko R. Schubert W. Lisanti M.P. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1341-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that by selectively excluding or concentrating signaling proteins, caveolae confer a degree of spatial organization on signal transduction pathways (11.Razani B. Woodman S.E. Lisanti M.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 431-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 14.Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Some receptors and signaling proteins are not fixed in the membrane but are translocated into or out of caveolae upon receptor activation (11.Razani B. Woodman S.E. Lisanti M.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 431-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 15.Lasley R.D. Narayan P. Uittenbogaard A. Smart E.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41447-41457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar).The present study offers the direct evidence that agonist stimulation induces a transient co-localization of GIRK channels with ET A receptor (ETAR) in caveolae, excluding BK B2 receptor (B2R) in mouse atrial myocytes, and that such compartmentalization is essential for receptor specificity in PIP2 signaling. Thus, the PIP2 microdomain created by caveolae plays a key role in the spatiotemporal coding of PIP2 signals, ensuring specificity of GqPCRs in cardiac myocytes.DISCUSSIONThe results of the present study demonstrate that the agonist-induced association of GIRK channel and selective receptors to caveoale is necessary for receptor-specific regulation of GIRK channels. In contrast to B2Rs, ETARs are clustered with GIRK channels to form discrete signaling complexes during receptor stimulation. The low PIP2 mobility limits the propagation of the PIP2 signal and confines PIP2 depletion to ETARs and co-localized GIRK channels, ensuring specificity of the signaling pathway.Signaling Microdomains for PIP2The results show that agonist stimulation induced signaling complexes linking ETAR and GIRK channels, excluding B2Rs. The signaling pathway involved in GIRK channel regulation is illustrated schematically in Fig. 6. Immunoprecipitation analysis suggests that M2AChR stimulation can induce the targeting of the M2AChR-GIRK channel complex to Cav-3, most probably via their lateral redistribution along the cell surface (Fig. 2). Immunoprecipitation data for GqPCR localization suggest that agonist stimulation might also induce the targeting of ETAR to Cav-3 but diminish B2R binding to Cav-3 (Fig. 3). By binding GIRK channel and ETAR receptors in caveolae, Cav-3 might bring both GIRK channel and ETAR in close proximity to each other, enabling these proteins to interact. This notion is supported by the fact that co-precipitation of ETAR and GIRK channels was increased after simultaneous activation of both pathways. In contrast, B2R dissociated from Cav-3 during B2R stimulation. By losing the scaffolding network, they could not interact with GIRK channel complexes.Caveolar disruption eliminated the receptor specificity of PIP2-mediated GIRK channel regulation (Fig. 1), suggesting that compartmentalization of GIRK channels and GqPCRs by caveolae may be important for specificity of PIP2 signals. However, co-localization of GIRK channels with their signaling partners can be attributed to, but is not solely sufficient, to cause receptor-specific regulation of GIRK channels. The present results show that when PIP2 mobility was high, GqPCR-induced regulation of GIRK channel was abolished (Fig. 4), suggesting that low mobility of PIP2 may be necessary for GqPCR-mediated regulation of GIRK. Thus, it is conceivable that only when combined with low PIP2 mobility, can complexes of ETARs with GIRK channels induce changes in [PIP2] in close proximity to GIRK channels high enough to induce a strong inhibition of GIRK channels. In line with this, B2Rs, which are physically excluded and remote from GIRK channel domains, might fail to deplete PIP2 near GIRK channels. This could prevent B2R from inhibiting GIRK channels. Furthermore, the possibility that receptor specificity of PIP2 signaling could be induced by differential abilities of GqPCRs to induce a compensatory PIP2 synthesis during concurrent PIP2 depletion could be ruled out (Fig. 5). In summary, given a diffusion-limited PIP2 signal, the geometric relationship between GIRK channels and GqPCRs determines the precise nature of the physiological response to this signal.Caveolae as Organizer of GIRK Channel Signaling NetworkCaveolae are abundantly present in cardiac myocytes, including ventricular, atrial, and nodal cells (12.Balijepalli R.C. Kamp T.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2008; 98: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although the caveolae of ventricle modulate excitation-contraction coupling, β2-adrenergic signaling, and ATP-sensitive K+ channel regulation (21.Balijepalli R.C. Foell J.D. Hall D.D. Hell J.W. Kamp T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7500-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 22.Garg V. Jiao J. Hu K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2009; 82: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29.Calaghan S. White E. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 69: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the role of caveolae in the atria remains unclear. The current data showed that caveolae can act as signaling platforms linking GIRK channels and GqPCRs in mouse atrial myocytes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show the role of caveolae in the receptor specificity of PIP2 signaling in native cardiac myocytes.The ability of caveolae to coordinate signaling pathways is related to the ability of selectively recruiting a certain set of signaling molecules while excluding others. Still, the mechanism responsible for reversible caveolin-protein interaction is unclear. It is conceivable that GIRK channels might be passively recruited to Cav-3 together with M2AChR, based on the fact that GIRK channels were occupied in stable association with M2AChR (Fig. 2) (23.Lavine N. Ethier N. Oak J.N. Pei L. Liu F. Trieu P. Rebois R.V. Bouvier M. Hebert T.E. Van Tol H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46010-46019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), which is known to translocate into the caveolae upon stimulation (30.Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In the case of ETAR, it is possible that its palmitoylation after agonist stimulation increases the affinity of ETAR for the caveolar membrane (31.Horstmeyer A. Cramer H. Sauer T. Müller-Esterl W. Schroeder C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20811-20819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32.Feron O. Balligand J.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 69: 788-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast to these receptors, B2R seems to translocate out of, rather than into, caveolae with receptor activation. These data conflict with reports showing the translocation of B2Rs into caveolae upon agonist stimulation in A431 cells (33.Haasemann M. Cartaud J. Muller-Esterl W. Dunia I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 917-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and HEK293 cells (34.Sabourin T. Bastien L. Bachvarov D.R. Marceau F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This discrepancy implies that the redistribution of GPCR to stimulation differs depending on cell type (35.Ostrom R.S. Insel P.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 143: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Experimental manipulations such as exposure time to agonist also need to be considered; presently, the effects of acute stimulation (4 min) on the localization of receptor were observed, whereas others focused on the effects of prolonged simulation (10–30 min) (33.Haasemann M. Cartaud J. Muller-Esterl W. Dunia I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 917-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Sabourin T. Bastien L. Bachvarov D.R. Marceau F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Indeed, receptor trafficking out of caveolae is not uncommon. A1-adenosine receptors of cardiac myocytes (15.Lasley R.D. Narayan P. Uittenbogaard A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4417-4421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and adrenergic β2- receptors were reported to exit caveolae upon receptor stimulation. Thus, dynamic targeting of GPCRs and stimulus-dependent protein-protein associations could be the logical mechanisms to ensure specificity of signaling, at the same time permitting similar pathways to exist in different parts of the same cell (Fig. 6).Because caveolae contribute to the fine spatial control of PIP2 signaling, changes in the caveolae density/function will perturb the compartmentalization of PIP2 signals, thereby affecting the ability of cardiac cells to produce the receptor-specific GIRK channel responses. Given that changes in caveolin expression, location, and caveolae density are seen with age, in cardiovascular diseases including cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac failure, and diabetes and following the use of drugs such as statins for treatment of cardiovascular disease (36.Sbaa E. Frérart F. Feron O. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2005; 15: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), this has wide implications. It is possible that dysregulation of the caveolar organization could contribute to arrhythmia or heart failure by affecting GIRK signaling complexes and consequently resulting in sympathovagal imbalance (37.Pfaffinger P.J. Martin J.M. Hunter D.D. Nathanson N.M. Hille B. Nature. 1985; 317: 536-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 38.Sakmann B. Noma A. Trautwein W. Nature. 1983; 303: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is strongly supported by the previous study reporting the development of heart failure in Cav-3−/− mice (11.Razani B. Woodman S.E. Lisanti M.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 431-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar).

One possible candidate for cross-talk for sympathovagal interaction and neurohormonal interaction in cardiac myocytes is the acetylcholine activated K+ (GIRK) channel. Recently, we and others found that α1-adrenergic receptor agonist inhibits GIRK channels by depleting PIP2 in the plasma membrane, indicating a novel pathway for sympathetic-parasympathetic interaction (7.Cho H.

ET-1 and angiotensin II can also regulate GIRK channel activity via PIP2 signaling (8.Meyer T. Wellner-Kienitz M.C. Biewald A. Bender K. Eickel A. Pott L. J. Biol.

However, although GIRK channels are regulated by PIP2, they do not respond to PIP2 hydrolysis from stimulation of all Gq-coupled receptors. We found that BK had no effect on GIRK channels, although being capable of hydrolyzing PIP2 in cardiac myocytes (9.Cho H. Lee D. Lee S.H. Ho W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4643-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is possible that these selective responses could discriminate the beneficial effect associated with BK from other Gq protein-coupled receptor (GqPCR) pathways. Until now, the molecular mechanisms underlying receptor specificity have been mostly unknown. Several mechanisms were suggested to explain the receptor-speci"

We examined the effect of a 70-day enhanced cholesterol diet (ECD) on ENaC and renal Na(+) handling. Rats were fed a standard chow or one supplemented with 1% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid (ECD). ECD animals exhibited marked anti-diuresis and anti-natriuresis (40 and 47%), which peaked at 1-3 weeks. Secondary compensation returned urine output and urinary Na(+) excretion to control levels by week 10. During these initial changes, there were no accompanying effects on systolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, or urinary creatinine excretion, indicating that the these effects of ECD preceded those which modify renal filtration and blood pressure. The effects of ECD on ENaC were evaluated by measuring the relative protein content of α, β, and γ subunits. α and γ blots were further examined for subunit cleavage (a process that activates ENaC). No significant changes were observed in α and β levels throughout the study. However, levels of cleaved γ were elevated, suggesting that ENaC was activated. The changes of γ persisted at week 10 and were accompanied by additional subunit fragments, indicating potential changes of γ-cleaving proteases. Enhanced protease activity, and specifically that which could act on the second identified cleavage site in γ, was verified in a newly developed urinary protease assay. These results predict enhanced ENaC activity, an effect that was confirmed in patch clamp experiments of principal cells of split open collecting ducts, where ENaC open probability was increased by 40% in the ECD group. These data demonstrate a complex series of events and a new regulatory paradigm that is initiated by ECD prior to the onset of elevated blood pressure. These events lead to changes of renal Na(+) handling, which occur in part by effects on extracellular γ-ENaC cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2036231949,"In CHO cells, CDK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of Ubc2/Rad6 at Ser(120) stimulates its ubiquitin conjugating activity and can be replicated by a S120D point mutant (Sarcevic, B., Mawson, A., Baker, R. T., and Sutherland, R. L. (2002) EMBO J. 21, 2009-2018). In contrast, we find that ectopic expression of wild type Ubc2b but not Ubc2bS120D or Ubc2bS120A in T47D human breast cancer cells specifically stimulates N-end rule-dependent degradation but not the Ubc2-independent unfolded protein response pathway, indicating that the former is E2 limiting in vivo and likely down-regulated by Ser(120) phosphorylation, as modeled by the S120D point mutation. In vitro kinetic analysis shows the in vivo phenotype of Ubc2bS120D and Ubc2bS120A is not due to differences in activating enzyme-catalyzed E2 transthiolation. However, the Ser(120) mutants possess marked differences in their abilities to support in vitro conjugation by the N-end rule-specific E3α/Ubr1 ligase that presumably accounts for their in vivo effects. Initial rate kinetics of human E3α-catalyzed conjugation of the human α-lactalbumin N-end rule substrate shows Ubc2bS120D is 20-fold less active than wild type E2, resulting from an 8-fold increase in K(m) and a 2.5-fold decrease in V(max), the latter reflecting a decreased ability to support the initial step in target protein conjugation; Ubc2bS120A is 8-fold less active than wild type E2 due almost exclusively to a decrease in V(max), reflecting a defect in polyubiquitin chain elongation. These studies suggest a mechanism for the integrated regulation of diverse ubiquitin-dependent signaling pathways through E2 phosphorylation that yields differential effects on its cognate ligases."
https://openalex.org/W2002253351,"Although the function of protein kinase D1 (PKD) in cardiac cells has remained enigmatic, recent work has shown that PKD phosphorylates the nuclear regulators HDAC5/7 (histone deacetylase 5/7) and CREB, implicating this kinase in the development of dysfunction seen in heart failure. Additional studies have shown that PKD also phosphorylates multiple sarcomeric substrates to regulate myofilament function. Initial studies examined PKD through adenoviral vector expression of wild type PKD, constitutively active PKD (caPKD), or dominant negative PKD in cultured adult rat ventricular myocytes. Confocal immunofluorescent images of these cells reveal a predominant distribution of all PKD forms in a non-nuclear, Z-line localized, striated reticular pattern, suggesting the importance of PKD in Ca(2+) signaling in heart. Consistent with an established role of PKD in targeting cardiac troponin I (cTnI), caPKD expression led to a marked decrease in contractile myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity with an unexpected electrical stimulus dependence to this response. This desensitization was accompanied by stimulus-dependent increases in cTnI phosphorylation in control and caPKD cells with a more pronounced effect in the latter. Electrical stimulation also provoked phosphorylation of regulatory site Ser(916) on PKD. The functional importance of this phospho-Ser(916) event is demonstrated in experiments with a phosphorylation-defective mutant, caPKD-S916A, which is functionally inactive and blocks stimulus-dependent increases in cTnI phosphorylation. Dominant negative PKD expression resulted in sensitization of the myofilaments to Ca(2+) and blocked stimulus-dependent increases in cTnI phosphorylation. Taken together, these data reveal that localized PKD may play a role as a dynamic regulator of Ca(2+) sensitivity of contraction in cardiac myocytes."
