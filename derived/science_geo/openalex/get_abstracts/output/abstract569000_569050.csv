https://openalex.org/W2520601585,"Macrophages play critical, but opposite, roles in acute and chronic inflammation and cancer. In response to pathogens or injury, inflammatory macrophages express cytokines that stimulate cytotoxic T cells, whereas macrophages in neoplastic and parasitic diseases express anti-inflammatory cytokines that induce immune suppression and may promote resistance to T cell checkpoint inhibitors. Here we show that macrophage PI 3-kinase γ controls a critical switch between immune stimulation and suppression during inflammation and cancer. PI3Kγ signalling through Akt and mTor inhibits NFκB activation while stimulating C/EBPβ activation, thereby inducing a transcriptional program that promotes immune suppression during inflammation and tumour growth. By contrast, selective inactivation of macrophage PI3Kγ stimulates and prolongs NFκB activation and inhibits C/EBPβ activation, thus promoting an immunostimulatory transcriptional program that restores CD8+ T cell activation and cytotoxicity. PI3Kγ synergizes with checkpoint inhibitor therapy to promote tumour regression and increased survival in mouse models of cancer. In addition, PI3Kγ-directed, anti-inflammatory gene expression can predict survival probability in cancer patients. Our work thus demonstrates that therapeutic targeting of intracellular signalling pathways that regulate the switch between macrophage polarization states can control immune suppression in cancer and other disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2518696212,"The inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity of breast cancer needs to be adequately captured in pre-clinical models. We have created a large collection of breast cancer patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTXs), in which the morphological and molecular characteristics of the originating tumor are preserved through passaging in the mouse. An integrated platform combining in vivo maintenance of these PDTXs along with short-term cultures of PDTX-derived tumor cells (PDTCs) was optimized. Remarkably, the intra-tumor genomic clonal architecture present in the originating breast cancers was mostly preserved upon serial passaging in xenografts and in short-term cultured PDTCs. We assessed drug responses in PDTCs on a high-throughput platform and validated several ex vivo responses in vivo. The biobank represents a powerful resource for pre-clinical breast cancer pharmacogenomic studies (http://caldaslab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/bcape), including identification of biomarkers of response or resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2520159331,"While acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comprises many disparate genetic subtypes, one shared hallmark is the arrest of leukemic myeloblasts at an immature and self-renewing stage of development. Therapies that overcome differentiation arrest represent a powerful treatment strategy. We leveraged the observation that the majority of AML, despite their genetically heterogeneity, share in the expression of HoxA9, a gene normally downregulated during myeloid differentiation. Using a conditional HoxA9 model system, we performed a high-throughput phenotypic screen and defined compounds that overcame differentiation blockade. Target identification led to the unanticipated discovery that inhibition of the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) enables myeloid differentiation in human and mouse AML models. In vivo, DHODH inhibitors reduced leukemic cell burden, decreased levels of leukemia-initiating cells, and improved survival. These data demonstrate the role of DHODH as a metabolic regulator of differentiation and point to its inhibition as a strategy for overcoming differentiation blockade in AML."
https://openalex.org/W2520176593,"Many body surfaces harbor organ-specific γδ T cell compartments that contribute to tissue integrity. Thus, murine dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs) uniquely expressing T cell receptor (TCR)-Vγ5 chains protect from cutaneous carcinogens. The DETC repertoire is shaped by Skint1, a butyrophilin-like (Btnl) gene expressed specifically by thymic epithelial cells and suprabasal keratinocytes. However, the generality of this mechanism has remained opaque, since neither Skint1 nor DETCs are evolutionarily conserved. Here, Btnl1 expressed by murine enterocytes is shown to shape the local TCR-Vγ7(+) γδ compartment. Uninfluenced by microbial or food antigens, this activity evokes the developmental selection of TCRαβ(+) repertoires. Indeed, Btnl1 and Btnl6 jointly induce TCR-dependent responses specifically in intestinal Vγ7(+) cells. Likewise, human gut epithelial cells express BTNL3 and BTNL8 that jointly induce selective TCR-dependent responses of human colonic Vγ4(+) cells. Hence, a conserved mechanism emerges whereby epithelia use organ-specific BTNL/Btnl genes to shape local T cell compartments."
https://openalex.org/W2520264800,"A major determinant of mRNA half-life is the codon-dependent rate of translational elongation. How the processes of translational elongation and mRNA decay communicate is unclear. Here, we establish that the DEAD-box protein Dhh1p is a sensor of codon optimality that targets an mRNA for decay. First, we find mRNAs whose translation elongation rate is slowed by inclusion of non-optimal codons are specifically degraded in a Dhh1p-dependent manner. Biochemical experiments show Dhh1p is preferentially associated with mRNAs with suboptimal codon choice. We find these effects on mRNA decay are sensitive to the number of slow-moving ribosomes on an mRNA. Moreover, we find Dhh1p overexpression leads to the accumulation of ribosomes specifically on mRNAs (and even codons) of low codon optimality. Lastly, Dhh1p physically interacts with ribosomes in vivo. Together, these data argue that Dhh1p is a sensor for ribosome speed, targeting an mRNA for repression and subsequent decay."

Differentiated mammary gland, neuronal, and pancreatic exocrine cells, identified using a combination of cell sorting and lineage tracing approaches, efficiently convert to proliferating cells with properties of stem/progenitor cells of their respective tissues after YAP induction. YAP-induced mammary stem/progenitor cells show molecular and functional properties similar to endogenous MaSCs, including organoid formation and mammary gland reconstitution after transplantation.

Because YAP/TAZ function is also important for self-renewal of endogenous stem cells in culture, our findings have implications for understanding the molecular determinants of the somatic stem cell state. Stem cells (SCs) display the capacity to self-renew when they divide and to generate a differentiated progeny. Somatic SCs operate in multiple adult organs for continuous tissue renewal or repair after injury. However, these cells are still mainly defined by operational definitions and cell surface markers, rather than the molecular traits that govern their special status (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2014Blanpain C. Fuchs E. Stem cell plasticity. Plasticity of epithelial stem cells in tissue regeneration.Science. 2014; 344: 1242281Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Unlimited availability of normal, somatic SCs will be critical for effective organ repopulation in regenerative medicine applications to understand SC biology and for disease modeling in the Petri dish. However, these efforts remain limited by the fact that SCs are rare and difficult to purify or expand from native tissues. Direct conversion of terminally differentiated cells back into their corresponding tissue-specific SCs may represent an attractive approach to obtain somatic SCs. Indeed, several reports have recently highlighted a surprising plasticity in somatic cell fates because differentiated cells can return to a SC status under special conditions, such as tissue damage (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2014Blanpain C. Fuchs E. Stem cell plasticity. Plasticity of epithelial stem cells in tissue regeneration.Science. 2014; 344: 1242281Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the factors able to control the somatic SC status remains poorly understood, limiting the exploitation of such plasticity. Dysregulation of the Hippo signaling pathway has been recently associated with cell fate plasticity. In tumors, activation of the Hippo pathway transcriptional effectors YAP/TAZ can reprogram non-stem cancer cells into cancer SCs (Cordenonsi et al., 2011Cordenonsi M. Zanconato F. Azzolin L. Forcato M. Rosato A. Frasson C. Inui M. Montagner M. Parenti A.R.

Genetic inactivation of the Hippo cascade induces liver overgrowth, in part by influencing liver cell fate and zonation (Lee et al., 2016Lee D.H. Park J.O. Kim T.S. Kim S.K. Kim T.H. Kim M.C.

Deshpande V. et al.YAP Inhibition Restores Hepatocyte Differentiation in Advanced HCC, Leading to Tumor Regression.Cell Rep. 2015; 10: 1692-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Nuclear YAP/TAZ proteins are found in anatomical locations enriched in tissue SCs, possibly as a consequence of their regulation by structural and chemical signals associated with the SC niche (Piccolo et al., 2014Piccolo S. Dupont S. Cordenonsi M. The biology of YAP/TAZ: hippo signaling and beyond.Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). That said, genetic ablation of YAP and/or TAZ from several adult organs in mice, such as liver, pancreas, intestine, and mammary gland, revealed that these factors are surprisingly dispensable during normal tissue homeostasis. Strikingly, however, in those same tissues, YAP/TAZ become essential for organ regrowth after tissue damage or oncogenic transformation (Azzolin et al., 2014Azzolin L. Panciera T. Soligo S. Enzo E. Bicciato S. Dupont S. Bresolin S. Frasson C. Basso G.

Cordenonsi M. Piccolo S. YAP/TAZ at the Roots of Cancer.Cancer Cell. 2016; 29: 783-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). This suggests that YAP/TAZ remain latent—and, thus, apparently dispensable—in normal adult tissues but are called into action to generate new stem cells. With this background in mind, we considered the possibility that ectopic expression of YAP or TAZ may be instrumental to turn differentiated cells into somatic stem-like cells. Here we tested this hypothesis in vitro by using distinct paradigms of terminal differentiation; that is, luminal mammary gland cells, neurons, and pancreatic exocrine cells. We found that transient expression of YAP/TAZ indeed converts differentiated cells into cells displaying multiple features of their corresponding tissue-specific SCs. Notably, the ability of YAP/TAZ to impart an SC state pairs with their endogenous function in isolated native SCs, where they are essential for preserving organoid-forming potential. Our work therefore reveals that a single factor can induce somatic stem cell features in cells of different lineages. The mammary gland represents a classic model system for the study of epithelial SCs and tissue regeneration. Remarkably, implantation of mammary gland SCs (MaSCs) into the mammary fat pad is sufficient to regenerate an entire ductal tree, with MaSCs contributing to both the luminal and myoepithelial lineages (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2014Blanpain C. Fuchs E. Stem cell plasticity. Plasticity of epithelial stem cells in tissue regeneration.Science. 2014; 344: 1242281Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Given that YAP/TAZ can reprogram non-stem mammary tumor cells into their corresponding cancer stem cells (CSCs) (Cordenonsi et al., 2011Cordenonsi M. Zanconato F. Azzolin L. Forcato M. Rosato A. Frasson C. Inui M. Montagner M. Parenti A.R. Poletti A. et al.The Hippo transducer TAZ confers cancer stem cell-related traits on breast cancer cells.Cell. 2011; 147: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that expression of YAP/TAZ may bestow stem-like characteristics on normal mammary cells as well. To address this, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate terminally differentiated luminal cells (LD, EpCAMhighCD49flowCD61−) from dissected mouse mammary glands (Guo et al., 2012Guo W. Keckesova Z. Donaher J.L. Shibue T. Tischler V. Reinhardt F. Itzkovitz S. Noske A. Zürrer-Härdi U. Bell G. et al.Slug and Sox9 cooperatively determine the mammary stem cell state.Cell. 2012; 148: 1015-1028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar; Figure 1A). LD cells expressed markers of terminal differentiation and, in culture, were void of any proliferative potential and remained as single cells (Figures S1B–S1D). This differs from the MaSC-enriched or luminal progenitor (LP) fractions, which formed solid and cavitated colonies, respectively (Figure S1D). Endogenous YAP/TAZ proteins and their transcriptional targets Ctgf and Axl were highly expressed in the MaSC-containing population but at much lower levels in differentiated cells (Figures 1B and 1C). To investigate whether ectopic expression of YAP or TAZ in LD cells could impart MaSC-like properties, FACS-purified LD cells were plated on collagen-coated dishes and transduced with doxycycline (Doxy)-inducible lentiviral vectors encoding for wild-type (WT) YAP or the activated versions of YAP and TAZ (i.e., YAP5SA or TAZ4SA, lacking inhibitory phosphorylation sites) (see the diagram in Figure 1D). As a control, cells were infected with an inducible EGFP vector. Transduced cells were cultured for 7 days in doxycycline-containing medium and then plated at clonogenic density in three-dimensional 5% Matrigel cultures (Experimental Procedures). Strikingly, cells expressing either YAP or TAZ formed solid colonies indistinguishable from those generated by MaSCs (Figures 1E and 1F) and very distinct from the cysts generated by LP cells (Figure S1D). EGFP-expressing control cells invariably remained as single cells without ever originating even a single colony in 33 experiments. As a further control, the expression of transcriptionally deficient YAPS94A (i.e., unable to interact with its DNA-binding partner TEAD) also had no effect. We then asked whether YAP/TAZ expression converted luminal differentiated cells to a MaSC-like state. This includes the ability to form colonies that can be serially passaged. Indeed, YAP/TAZ-induced colonies, similarly to those generated from MaSCs, could form additional generations of colonies after single-cell dissociation (Figures 1G and 1H). Notably, colonies could be passaged even after expression of ectopic YAP had been turned off (by removing doxycycline) (Figures 1G, 1H and S3A). This suggests that transient expression of YAP/TAZ is sufficient to stably endow self-renewal potential to differentiated mammary cells. We thus designated the YAP/TAZ-induced “MaSC-like” cells as “yMaSCs.” To verify whether the switch from LD to yMaSC could be recapitulated at the single-cell level, individual LD cells were seeded in 96-well plates (visually verified) and induced to express YAP. By monitoring the resulting outgrowths, we found that these individual cells formed solid colonies with high frequency (Figure S1F; 18.5% on average in the three independent experiments). From this experiment, we also noticed that this frequency of conversion, combined with the lack of colony-forming cells in controls (0%), argues against the hypothesis that yMaSCs arise from rare, contaminating, pre-existing stem/progenitors in our LD preparations. Of note, we also found that overexpressing YAP in the endogenous MaSC-enriched cell population does not increase its colony-forming capacity (Figure S1G). In other words, even if rare contaminant MaSCs were present, then these would remain rare and not be expanded by YAP expression. To validate the notion that YAP expression converts differentiated cells to an SC fate, we carried out reprogramming of LD cells purified from K8-CreERT2; R26-LSL-YFP mice (Figure 2A), allowing for a lineage tracing strategy to genetically label luminal cells (Van Keymeulen et al., 2011Van Keymeulen A. Rocha A.S. Ousset M. Beck B. Bouvencourt G. Rock J. Sharma N. Dekoninck S. Blanpain C. Distinct stem cells contribute to mammary gland development and maintenance.Nature. 2011; 479: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). For this experiment, we first FACS-purified LD cells (as in Figure 1A). After plating, cells were exposed to a pulse of tamoxifen to activate the YFP tracer exclusively in K8-positive cells and then infected with empty or YAP-expressing vectors. Colonies generated by YAP reprogramming of LD cells were entirely YFP-positive, confirming their origin from the luminal lineage (Figures 2B and S2A). As a control, we validated that the K8-CreERT2 tracing was restricted to luminal cells. Tamoxifen-treated MaSCs from the K8-CreERT2; R26-LSL-YFP mammary gland formed colonies that were exclusively YFP-negative (n = 154, 0% YFP+) (Figure 2B). These results also argue against the possibility that YFP-labeled yMaSCs could emerge from contaminating endogenous MaSCs. The same conclusion was further validated by a complementary experiment in which we genetically labeled the basal/MaSC-enriched cell population by using K14-CreERT2; R26-LSL-YFP mice (Van Keymeulen et al., 2011Van Keymeulen A. Rocha A.S. Ousset M. Beck B. Bouvencourt G. Rock J. Sharma N. Dekoninck S. Blanpain C. Distinct stem cells contribute to mammary gland development and maintenance.Nature. 2011; 479: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar; Figure 2A). LD cells and MaSCs were sorted by FACS as above and then treated with a pulse of tamoxifen to label K14-positive cells. YAP-reprogrammed LD cells purified from this genetic setup generated yMaSC colonies that were invariably void of any YFP expression (0%, n = 122) (Figure 2C). As a positive control, endogenous MaSCs traced by K14-CreERT2 labeling formed YFP-positive colonies (Figure 2C). Collectively, several lines of evidence indicate that yMaSCs do not emerge from rare contaminating MaSCs pre-existing in our LD preparation. We conclude from these lineage-tracing experiments that YAP acts in differentiated cells to reprogram them into a MaSC-like state. We then examined whether yMaSCs are functionally equivalent to mammary SCs, as determined by additional characteristic properties of SCs, such as the ability to self-organize in vitro into mammary tissue-like structures, to differentiate along distinct lineages, and to regenerate a mammary tree in vivo after injection into a cleared mammary fat pad. For this, we sought to establish a long-term culture system that allows mammary SCs to form mammary gland-like structures in vitro. MaSC- and yMaSC-derived colonies were transferred and embedded into 100% Matrigel and overlaid with “organoid” medium (Sato et al., 2009Sato T. Vries R.G. Snippert H.J. van de Wetering M. Barker N. Stange D.E. van Es J.H. Abo A. Kujala P. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche.Nature. 2009; 459: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar) in the absence of doxycycline. Under these conditions, colonies underwent extensive budding and, by 2 weeks, grew into large epithelial organoids (Figure 3A; Figures S3B and S3C; see the legend of Figure 3A for quantification). Organoids derived from yMaSCs were indistinguishable in growth pattern, size, and frequency from those generated by natural MaSCs. yMaSC-derived organoids were dissociated, replated as single cells every 2 weeks, and cultured for at least 12 months (i.e., >25 passages) without changes in growth pattern, plating efficiency, and differentiation potential. By histological examination, both MaSC and yMaSC organoids were composed by a stratified epithelium reminiscent of the histology of the mammary gland (E-cadherin-positive; Figure S3C). Internal cells surrounding a lumen-like cavity expressed differentiated luminal markers such as K8 and K19 (Figures 3B and 3C). Outer cells (either at external surfaces or bordering inner folds) displayed expression of basal, myoepithelial, and SC markers (K14, α-smooth muscle actin [α-SMA], p63) (Figures 3B–3D). yMaSCs derived from K8-CreERT2; R26-LSL-YFP-traced LD cells (as in Figure 2B) generated organoids with YFP-positive and K14-positive basal cells (Figures 3E and S2A), attesting to their origin from reprogrammed LD cells. Furthermore, addition of a lactogenic stimulus triggered expression of α- and β-casein, indicative of alveolar (milk-producing) cell differentiation (Figures 3F and S3G). To molecularly characterize yMaSCs, we FACS-purified yMaSCs from organoids and evaluated the expression of luminal and basal and/or stem cell markers (Figure S3H). yMaSCs were remarkably similar to native MaSCs (freshly purified from the mammary gland) because they express basal markers (including myoepithelial markers such as α-Sma and Myh11) but not luminal markers (Claudin1, K8, K18, and K19). yMaSCs also express genes previously associated with various types of adult mammary SCs, including ΔNp63, Lgr4/5/6, and Procr, and all to levels comparable with MaSCs (Chakrabarti et al., 2014Chakrabarti R.

By unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles, organoids from MaSCs or yMaSCs could not be distinguished (Figure 3G). Taken together, the results indicate that, similar to authentic MaSCs, yMaSCs display self-renewal potential, generate self-organizing epithelial structures reminiscent of the normal mammary gland, and retain multilineage differentiation ability. Next we tested whether yMaSCs displayed mammary gland reconstituting activity. For this, FACS-purified LD cells were transduced with vectors encoding for EGFP and inducible wild-type YAP. Cells were treated with doxycycline for 7 days and then transplanted (103–104 cells) into the cleared mammary fat pads of non-obese diabetic (NOD)-severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Strikingly, cells that had experienced transient expression of wild-type YAP had also acquired the ability to regenerate the mammary gland (25%, n = 16) (Figures 3H and 3I). Ductal tree and terminal end buds were regenerated when as few as 100 YAP-reprogrammed LD cells were implanted (33%, n = 6). As a control, LD cells transduced with the sole EGFP vector did not display any reconstituting activity at any inoculum dose (0%, n = 28, 102–5 × 104) (Figure S3I). Histological analyses revealed that the epithelial outgrowths obtained from yMaSCs were EGFP-positive and morphologically indistinguishable from those generated by endogenous MaSCs and consisted of a bilayered epithelium composed of a basal and/or myoepithelial layer (positive for K14 and α-SMA) overlaid by luminal cells (positive for K8 and K19) (Figures 3J and S3J). To explore the reconstituting potential of a single yMaSC, we injected in the cleared fat pads single-cell derived organoids and found that these were also able to regenerate the mammary gland (33%, n = 6). Notably, when these mice were impregnated, reconstituted mammary glands generated a dense ductal system ending in clusters of milk-secreting alveoli, indicating that yMaSCs retain full differentiation potential in vivo (Figures 3K and 3L). We conclude from this collective set of experiments that transient expression of YAP/TAZ in differentiated cells of the mammary gland is able to convert them into bona fide MaSCs. YAP/TAZ are not only instrumental for reprogramming of differentiated mammary cells but also endogenously required in MaSCs for preserving their self-renewal potential. Indeed, we generated organoids from either endogenous MaSCs or yMaSCs obtained from Yapfl/fl; Tazfl/fl mice; deletion of endogenous YAP/TAZ by Adeno-Cre severely affected the ability of organoids to self-renew upon passaging (Figure S3K). Consistently, we also found that conversion to the ySC state was accompanied by activation of endogenous YAP/TAZ proteins. As shown in Figure S3L, induction of exogenous YAP in LD cells turned on expression of endogenous YAP and TAZ that remained expressed in ySC-derived organoids after ectopic YAP expression had been turned off (see Figure S3A for on-off control of exogenous YAP expression). We conclude that transient exposure to YAP/TAZ is sufficient to empower a self-sustaining loop of endogenous YAP/TAZ expression. Neurons are post-mitotic cells that have been long considered refractory to any cell fate change. Endogenous YAP and TAZ proteins are highly expressed and transcriptionally active in neural stem cells (NSCs) but absent in neurons (Figures S4A–S4E), prompting us to determine whether ectopic expression of YAP in neurons was sufficient to convert them into NSCs. Primary cultures enriched in post-mitotic neurons (Figures 5A and S5A; see below) were obtained from the hippocampus or cortex from late mouse embryos (embryonic day 19 [E19]) or newborns. Cells were cultured in serum-free neuronal differentiation medium (Neurobasal with B27 containing vitamin A) also containing cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC) for 7 days to support neuronal differentiation and eliminate proliferating cells (Figure 4A). To follow the fate of post-mitotic neurons during YAP reprogramming, we adopted redundant lineage tracing strategies to stably label post-mitotic neurons. For this we prepared primary neurons from the brain of Syn1-Cre or Thy1-Cre transgenic mice expressing the Cre recombinase exclusively in post-mitotic neurons under the control of a neuron-specific promoter (Zhu et al., 2001Zhu Y. Romero M.I. Ghosh P. Ye Z. Charnay P. Rushing E.J. Marth J.D. Parada L.F.

We validated that expression of the lineage tracer was restricted to cells displaying unambiguous neuronal morphology and markers, whereas none of these traced cells was ever positive for NSCs and/or progenitor markers, as detailed in Figures 4C, 4D, and 4H and Figures S4F–S4H. Primary cells were infected with lentiviral vectors encoding for reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) and inducible wild-type YAP (Experimental Procedures). After AraC, neurons were shifted to NSC medium in the presence of doxycycline (see experimental outline in Figure 4A). Remarkably, after 2 weeks, neurosphere-like structures emerged from YAP-expressing neurons (P0 spheres) but never from neurons transduced with rtTA alone or rtTA combined with empty vectors or transcriptionally inactive YAPS94A (Figure 4E). Lineage-traced neurons from Syn1-Cre; R26-CAG-LSL-tdTomato or Thy1-Cre; R26-LSL-LacZ transgenic mice gave rise to tdTomato-positive or β-galactosidase (β-gal)-positive neurospheres, respectively (Figures 4F and 4G). Similarly, infection with tetO-YAP lentiviruses of neurons from mice bearing Syn1-Cre or Thy1-Cre and the R26-LSL-rtTA-IRES-EGFP reporter generated EGFP-positive yNSCs (Figures 4H and S4G–S4I). In contrast, NSCs derived from the same strains were invariably unlabeled (Figures 4F, left panel, and 4G, left panel). This confirms that, as originally described (Zhu et al., 2001Zhu Y. Romero M.I. Ghosh P. Ye Z. Charnay P. Rushing E.J. Marth J.D. Parada L.F.

By monitoring the process more closely using lineage-traced neurons from Syn1-Cre; R26-CAG-LSL-tdTomato, we found that Doxy addition triggered YAP expression in about 30% of these neurons, and that, of these, 25% became positive for the NSC marker Nestin 2–3 days after switching them to the NSC medium (Figure S4J). This frequency of conversion, combined with the fact that no Nestin-positive neurons were present before YAP induction and no Nestin-positive neurons ever appeared in control cultures, argues against the possibility that yNSCs arose from rare pre-existing stem/progenitor cells in our neuronal preparations. This is in line with the above conclusions drawn from lineage tracing experiments. Of note, we also found that overexpressing YAP in endogenous NSCs does not increase neurosphere-forming capacity (Figure S4K). Thus, even if rare contaminant NSCs were present, then it seems these would remain rare and not be expanded by YAP expression. P0 spheres of yNSCs were transferred to new plates for further growth and could then be propagated for several passages as clonal outgrowths after single-cell dissociation, similarly to native NSCs (Figures 4I–4L). Lineage tracing was retained upon passaging (Figures 4F and 4G), indicating that YAP-reprogrammed neurons had acquired self-renewing properties. The propagation of yNSCs as neurospheres did not require addition of doxycycline, indicating that transient exposure to exogenous YAP is sufficient to induce self-renewal properties that are autonomously maintained. In line, as shown by experiments with a Cre-excisable tetO-YAP lentiviral vector, post-reprogramming deletion of the whole YAP-encoding viral cassette had no effects on yNSC maintenance (Figures S4L–S4N). Next we characterized yNSCs by marker gene expression using immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, and gene profiling. As shown in Figures 5A and 5B and Figures S5A and S5B, yNSCs completely lost expression of the terminal differentiation markers present in the original neurons (such as TUJ1, TAU, and NEUN) and, instead, expressed high levels of NSC markers (Nestin, SOX2, and Vimentin). Furthermore, we compared the transcriptome of parental neurons, yNSCs, and native NSCs and found that yNSCs completely lost their neuronal identity and acquired a gene expression profile closely similar to native NSCs (Figure 5C). Neural SCs are defined as tripotent, as attested to by their ability to differentiate in astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. We therefore examined the differentiation potential of yNSCs by placing them under appropriate culture conditions (Experimental Procedures). yNSCs could differentiate into astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes as defined by markers and morphology (Figures 5D–5F and S5C–S5E) and thus are indeed tripotent. To investigate the in vivo differentiation potential of yNSCs, we transplanted EGFP-labeled yNSCs in the brain of newborn mice (n = 5). Four weeks after transplantation, grafted yNSCs invariably lost Nestin positivity (Figure S5F) and mainly remained close to the injection site, where they primarily acquired expression of GFAP, indicative of astrocyte differentiation (Figures 5G and 5H). Injected yNSCs also differentiated into NEUN- and TUJ1-positive neurons or CNPase-positive oligodendrocytes (Figures 5I and 5J). Importantly, no tumor formation was ever observed after histological examination of the yNSCs-injected brain parenchyma. Thus, YAP induces conversion of neurons into cells that have functional properties similar to those of normal NSCs. As for MaSCs, endogenous YAP/TAZ are essential to sustain"

Gender-specific differences in the occurrence of social and emotional disorders are well documented. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is characterized by impaired social communication and restrictive, repetitive behaviors, is several-fold more prevalent in males than females (Rubenstein et al., 2015Rubenstein E.

It is released in response to a variety of social cues and acts through OXT receptors (OXTRs) that are widely dispersed in the brain and periphery (Owen et al., 2013Owen S.F. Tuncdemir S.N. Bader P.L. Tirko N.N. Fishell G. Tsien R.W. Oxytocin enhances hippocampal spike transmission by modulating fast-spiking interneurons.Nature. 2013; 500: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Studies of behaviors altered in response to systemic or local administration of OXT and analysis of behavioral phenotypes evident in knockout mice lacking Oxt or Oxtr have demonstrated definitively that this hormone system plays essential roles in maternal care, social cognition, and affiliative behaviors. Stressful and anxiogenic stimuli result in the release of OXT, which acts as a powerful modulator of anxiety- and stress-related behaviors. These studies have led to a great deal of interest in OXT as a potential treatment for human social disorders, resulting in a large number of clinical trials to assess its therapeutic efficacy. Although the results of these trials have been encouraging in the context of ASD and anxiety disorders, our understanding of the brain circuits engaged by endogenous or exogenously supplied OXT and their role in specific behaviors remains incomplete. We have recently identified a specific class of OXTR interneurons (OxtrINs) in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that express Oxtr and are activated in response to OXT (Nakajima et al., 2014Nakajima M. Görlich A. Heintz N. Oxytocin modulates female sociosexual behavior through a specific class of prefrontal cortical interneurons.Cell. 2014; 159: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Genetic and pharmacological studies of these neurons revealed that they modulate female social interactions with male mice during the sexually responsive, estrus phase of their cycle. Although the number of OxtrINs in the male mPFC is equivalent to that in the female mPFC, social behavior of male mice was not altered by the silencing of OxtrINs or blockade of OXT signaling in the mPFC. While it is possible that these neurons are dedicated to modulation of social behaviors in female mice, OXT administration can impact a wide range of behaviors in both males and females. Furthermore, human imaging studies have indicated that OXT elicits activity in cortical and subcortical sites in both sexes, although gender-specific differences in these responses have been noted (Bethlehem et al., 2013Bethlehem R.A. van Honk J. Auyeung B. Baron-Cohen S.

Feifel D. Oxytocin’s role in anxiety: a critical appraisal.Brain Res. 2014; 1580: 22-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It seems probable, therefore, that OxtrINs in the mPFC of male mice also modulate behavior in response to changing levels of OXT, but that gender-specific differences in physiology or circuitry result in sexually dimorphic behavioral outcomes. Here, we report that optogenetic activation of OxtrINs in male mice has a strong anxiolytic effect and no impact on social interaction, whereas activation of these neurons in female mice results in increased sociality and no change in anxiety-related behaviors. Postsynaptic responses to activation of OxtrINs in cortical pyramidal cells are primarily inhibitory. Layer 2/3 neurons respond more robustly in male mice, whereas postsynaptic responses in layer 5 are enhanced in females. TRAP (translational ribosome affinity purification) translational profiling (Heiman et al., 2008Heiman M. Schaefer A. Gong S. Peterson J.D. Day M. Ramsey K.E. Suarez-Farinas M. Schwarz C.

Surmeier D.J. et al.A translational profiling approach for the molecular characterization of CNS cell types.Cell. 2008; 135: 738-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) revealed that expression of the corticotropin-releasing-hormone (CHP)-binding protein (CRHBP) gene (Crhbp) (Van Den Eede et al., 2005Van Den Eede F. Van Broeckhoven C. Claes S.J. Corticotropin-releasing factor-binding protein, stress and major depression.Ageing Res. Rev. 2005; 4: 213-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of the stress hormone CRH (Laryea et al., 2012Laryea G. Arnett M.G. Muglia L.J. Behavioral studies and genetic alterations in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurocircuitry: insights into human psychiatric disorders.Behav. Sci. (Basel). 2012; 2: 135-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), is specifically enriched in OxtrINs. Upon CRH application, induced activity of male, but not female, layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in mPFC slice recordings was potentiated. This response to CRH was blocked by optogenetic stimulation of OxtrINs and enhanced by bath application of a CRHBP antagonist. Infusion of OXT into the mPFC resulted in a significant decrease of anxiety-related behavior in male mice. This anxiolytic effect was blocked by co-infusion of a CRHBP antagonist. Furthermore, short-hairpin-RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of Crhbp expression in OxtrINs of the mPFC resulted in increased anxiety-related behaviors only in male mice. Finally, CRH expression in female mice is strongly elevated. Taken together, these data identify a molecular mechanism regulating male-specific anxiety-related behaviors. They demonstrate that OXT acts through OxtrINs and CRHBP to moderate the anxiogenic effects of the stress hormone CRH in the mPFC. When taken together with our previous study of the role of OxtrINs in female sociosexual behavior, these results provide an important illustration of the concept that higher brain circuits regulating complex behaviors may be identical in males and females yet retain the ability to generate gender-specific behaviors based on differential sensitivity to sexually dimorphic hormones. They suggest that coordination of the local actions of OXT and CRH in the cerebral cortex by OxtrINs and CRHBP may be involved in the modulation of a wide variety of gender-specific cognitive and behavioral functions. To investigate the function of OxtrINs in male mice, we performed two types of genetic manipulations. First, we used Oxtr-Cre mice (Nakajima et al., 2014Nakajima M. Görlich A. Heintz N. Oxytocin modulates female sociosexual behavior through a specific class of prefrontal cortical interneurons.Cell. 2014; 159: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) for optogenetic activation of OxtrINs (Figures 1A–1I). For this purpose, the mPFC of male and female Oxtr-Cre mice were stereotactically injected with a Cre-dependent AAV virus expressing channelrhodopsin (ChR2-H134R), and fiber-optic cannulas were implanted in the prelimbic cortex (Figures 1A–1C; Figures S1A–S1D). Behavioral responses during blue-light (BL) on and off periods were scored in the three-chamber social interaction test, the open field (OF) test, and the elevated plus maze (EPM). Optogenetic activation of OxtrINs in the mPFC of female mice promoted social preference toward male mice (Figure 1D), consistent with the suppression of sociosexual preference observed by silencing these same neurons (Nakajima et al., 2014Nakajima M. Görlich A. Heintz N. Oxytocin modulates female sociosexual behavior through a specific class of prefrontal cortical interneurons.Cell. 2014; 159: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, male mice showed no significant changes in social interaction upon light activation of OxtrINs (Figure 1E). Given that the oxytocin system can also affect behavioral responses to stress (Neumann and Slattery, 2016Neumann I.D. Slattery D.A. Oxytocin in general anxiety and social fear: a translational approach.Biol. Psychiatry. 2016; 79: 213-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), we next examined whether OxtrINs can contribute to the regulation of anxiety-related behaviors in males. Avoidance of the open arms of the EPM and decreased exploration time in the center of the OF are established behavioral tests that are used to assess anxiety-like behavior in rodents. In female mice, activation of OxtrINs by BL had no impact on the behavior of the animals in either of these assays (Figures 1F and 1H). However, optogenetic activation of OxtrINs in the mPFC of male mice resulted in more exploration of the open arms of the EPM (Figure 1G) and increased time in the center area of the OF arena (Figure 1I) compared to the light-off phase. As expected, the strength of the anxiety phenotype in male mice correlated directly with the number of OxtrINs expressing ChR2 (Figures S1A–S1C). These data demonstrate that activation of OxtrINs in the mPFC results in the induction of distinct gender-specific behaviors. They confirm our previous studies demonstrating a role for OxtrINs in female sociosexual behavior (Nakajima et al., 2014Nakajima M. Görlich A. Heintz N. Oxytocin modulates female sociosexual behavior through a specific class of prefrontal cortical interneurons.Cell. 2014; 159: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and establish a role for these same neurons in the modulation of anxiety-related behaviors in male mice.Figure S1Efficacy of Viral Injections and Locomotor Activity in Oxtr-Cre and Oxtrf/f Mice, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A-B) Representative confocal images of Oxtr-Cre::ChR2 mice showing a low (A) or high (B) number of OtxrINs expressing ChR2-mCherry in the mPFC.

To determine whether the anxiolytic effect of OxtrINs in male mice requires OXT/OXTR signaling, as we have shown previously for sociosexual behavior in females (Nakajima et al., 2014Nakajima M. Görlich A. Heintz N. Oxytocin modulates female sociosexual behavior through a specific class of prefrontal cortical interneurons.Cell. 2014; 159: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we conducted a second set of experiments using Cre-expressing AAV viruses injected into mice carrying a conditional allele of the Oxtr gene (Oxtrflox/flox) (Lee et al., 2008Lee H.J. Caldwell H.K. Macbeth A.H. Tolu S.G. Young 3rd, W.S. A conditional knockout mouse line of the oxytocin receptor.Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 3256-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We bilaterally injected the mPFC of adult male and female Oxtrflox/flox mice with AAV-expressing Cre to delete the receptor (Oxtrf/f:Cre). As a control, we injected control Oxtrflox/flox mice with an AAV-expressing GFP (Oxtrf/f:GFP) that cannot result in deletion of Oxtr. As shown in Figures 1J and 1L, deletion of the Oxtr in female mice has no significant effect on performance in either the OF or EPM assays. However, in male mice, deletion of Oxtr resulted in a strong anxiogenic effect. Thus, male Oxtrf/f:Cre mice spent significantly less time in open arms of the EPM and in the center of the OF arena than did the control male Oxtrf/f:GFP mice (Figures 1K and 1M). There were no significant differences in anxiety levels between control males and females (Figures 1F–1M), and between females during estrus and diestrus (Figure S1E). There were also no major differences in total locomotor behavior as a consequence of optogenetic activation or Oxtr deletion, although a slight increase in female locomotion in the OF test was observed with Oxtr deletion (Figures S1F–S1I). We conclude that OXT action on OxtrINs in the mPFC regulates distinct, gender-specific behaviors. OxtrINs are regular spiking, GABAergic interneurons that increase their rate of firing in response to OXT (Nakajima et al., 2014Nakajima M. Görlich A. Heintz N. Oxytocin modulates female sociosexual behavior through a specific class of prefrontal cortical interneurons.Cell. 2014; 159: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism by which OxtrINs activation regulates local circuit activity, we performed whole-cell recordings of layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons in acute brain slices of the mPFC during photostimulation of ChR2-expressing OxtrINs (Figure 2). Brief light stimulation (470 nm) efficiently evoked action potentials in ChR2-mCherry expressing OxtrINs in slice preparations (Figures 2A–2C). We observed no differences in the response of male and female OxtrINs to BL at different frequencies (Figure 2C). To measure postsynaptic responses to OxtrINs activation, light-evoked responses of layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons (Figure 2D) were recorded at 0-mV and −60-mV holding potentials, allowing independent detection of both GABA- and AMPA-receptor-mediated currents (Figures S2A and S2B). OxtrINs synapse extensively with layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons in both genders. Thus, in males, 91.3% of layer 2/3 and 97% of layer 5 neurons responded to OxtrINs activation, whereas 95.2% of layer 2/3 and 95.6% of layer 5 pyramidal neurons responded in females (Figure 2E).Figure S2EPSCs and IPSCs Recorded in Layer 2/3 and Layer 5 upon BL Stimulation, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A, B) Representative responses of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells to blue light pulses elicited picrotoxin sensitive inhibitory (IPSC) responses at 0mV (blue) and CNQX and AP5 sensitive excitatory (EPSC) responses at −60mV (red).(C, D) Quantitation of IPSCs amplitudes in layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal cells at medium and low BL intensities indicates that the differences in IPSCs response sizes between male and females are detected at all laser intensities.

Two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. ∗p < 0.05. Analysis of the amplitudes of postsynaptic responses elicited by optogenetic activation of OxtrINs revealed that GABAergic responses to activation of OxtrINs differed between males and females (Figures 2F–2K). Inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) elicited in response of BL activation were significantly larger in male layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (Figures 2F and 2H), whereas IPSCs in layer 5 postsynaptic neurons were larger in females (Figures 2I and 2K). These differences in IPSCs between males and females were observed at different BL intensities (Figures S2C and S2D). Excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes were also larger in females in layer 5 (Figures 2J and 2K). No differences in EPSC amplitudes in layer 2/3 (Figures 2G and 2H) were observed between male and female neurons. Thus, the electrophysiological evidence presented here establishes that there is broad connectivity between OxtrINs and pyramidal cells in the mPFC of both sexes and that the strength of inhibition in male and female neurons in the mPFC is both laminar and gender specific. Although the differences in postsynaptic inhibitory responses we observed between male and female neurons may explain the gender-specific anxiolytic effect of OXT, the response differences between genders suggested that additional factors might be involved. To gain insight into signaling pathways that are active in OxtrINs and to elucidate candidate mechanisms that might play a role in the anxiolytic effects of OxtrINs activation, we used TRAP to identify proteins actively synthesized in these cells in the mPFC. This was accomplished using Oxtr-Cre mice (Nakajima et al., 2014Nakajima M. Görlich A. Heintz N.

Six replicate samples were collected from the mPFC of Oxtr-Cre/EGFP-L10a mice, and the resulting RNA was sequenced from each sample. Normalized values from each of the six replicates and their averages were obtained for both the INPUT and immunoprecipitation (IP) samples (Table S1). These data provided us with a more comprehensive and quantitative list of highly translated mRNAs than that available from our previous microarray analyses and allowed us to confirm the reported (Nakajima et al., 2014Nakajima M.

As shown in the scatterplot in Figure 3A, these markers are expressed at quite different levels, and each of them is significantly enriched in the OxtrINs IP data relative to the sample taken from the intact mPFC prior to IP (INPUT). To evaluate expressed genes as possible candidates for further analysis, we first removed genes whose mRNAs were present at low levels (base mean < 25.00) and then sorted for mRNAs that are highly enriched in the OxtrINs IP data (log2-fold change IP v INPUT). This resulted in the identification of a large number of known interneuron markers, and a variety of transcription factors, receptors, and signaling proteins that were not known previously to be enriched in OxtrINs (Table S1).Figure 3TRAP Profiling Reveals Cell-Specific Enrichment of CRHBP in OxtrINsShow full caption(A) Scatterplot of average TRAP IP samples (y axis) versus (v) INPUT samples (x axis) from the mPFC of Oxtr-EFGP-L10a mic"

Learning and memory are fundamental components of our personality and are significantly impaired in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). During learning and memory formation, many individual neurons change their activity, which ultimately leads to rewiring of neuronal networks. On the subcellular level, altered neuronal activity induces structural remodeling of synapses, supporting the concept that individual synapses may represent the smallest computational unit necessary for information storage (Caroni et al., 2014Caroni P.

Therefore, we sought to identify learning- and memory-dependent rewiring of inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus, the predominantly affected brain area in AD. Synapse loss correlates with cognitive decline and has been proposed as a potential cause for learning and memory deficits in AD (Huang and Mucke, 2012Huang Y. Mucke L. Alzheimer mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.Cell. 2012; 148: 1204-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar).

Fibrillar amyloid deposition leads to local synaptic abnormalities and breakage of neuronal branches.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1181-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). These structural plasticity impairments on the synapse level could be linked to increased action potential firing of pyramidal neurons (Šišková et al., 2014Šišková Z. Justus D. Kaneko H.

USA. 2012; 109: 8740-8745Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for the hyperactivity of excitatory neurons represents an imbalance between excitation and inhibition, which had been proposed as the basis for neuronal network dysfunction (Palop et al., 2007Palop J.J. Chin J. Roberson E.D. Wang J. Thwin M.T. Bien-Ly N. Yoo J. Ho K.O. Yu G.Q.

Indeed, restoring the function of parvalbumin (PV)-positive inhibitory neurons normalized network synchrony and rescued memory deficits in an AD model (Verret et al., 2012Verret L. Mann E.O. Hang G.B. Barth A.M. Cobos I. Ho K. Devidze N. Masliah E. Kreitzer A.C. Mody I. et al.Inhibitory interneuron deficit links altered network activity and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer model.Cell. 2012; 149: 708-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Besides PV, somatostatin (SST)-positive inhibitory neurons are another important class of hippocampal interneurons that have been shown to be critically involved in learning and memory processes (Lovett-Barron et al., 2014Lovett-Barron M. Kaifosh P. Kheirbek M.A. Danielson N. Zaremba J.D. Reardon T.R. Turi G.F. Hen R. Zemelman B.V. Losonczy A. Dendritic inhibition in the hippocampus supports fear learning.Science. 2014; 343: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Oriens lacunosum-moleculare (O-LM) interneurons, one type of SST-positive interneurons in the hippocampus, provide feedback inhibition to CA1 pyramidal neurons (Royer et al., 2012Royer S. Zemelman B.V. Losonczy A. Kim J. Chance F. Magee J.C. Buzsáki G. Control of timing, rate and bursts of hippocampal place cells by dendritic and somatic inhibition.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and receive long-range cholinergic projections from the medial septum (Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008Klausberger T. Somogyi P. Neuronal diversity and temporal dynamics: the unity of hippocampal circuit operations.Science. 2008; 321: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). The cholinergic projections have been described to be essential for aversive learning (Lovett-Barron et al., 2014Lovett-Barron M. Kaifosh P. Kheirbek M.A. Danielson N. Zaremba J.D. Reardon T.R. Turi G.F. Hen R. Zemelman B.V. Losonczy A. Dendritic inhibition in the hippocampus supports fear learning.Science. 2014; 343: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In AD and mouse models of AD, loss of cholinergic neurons is well documented (Davies and Maloney, 1976Davies P. Maloney A.J. Selective loss of central cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer’s disease.Lancet. 1976; 2: 1403Abstract PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar, Perez et al., 2007Perez S.E. Dar S. Ikonomovic M.D. DeKosky S.T. Mufson E.J. Cholinergic forebrain degeneration in the APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 transgenic mouse.Neurobiol. Dis. 2007; 28: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas the mechanism by which cholinergic degeneration impacts inhibitory interneuron function remains unknown. Therefore, we hypothesized that O-LM interneuron dysfunction contributes to learning and memory deficits in a mouse model with AD-like pathology. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether synapses of hippocampal O-LM interneurons exhibited beta-amyloidosis-dependent alterations of structural plasticity in diseased mice, and whether learning-evoked remodeling of synapses occurred in healthy animals and was altered as a consequence of the disease. Transgenic mice that express enhanced GFP (eGFP) under the glutamate decarboxylase 1 (Gad1) promoter in hippocampal inhibitory interneurons (Gad1-eGFP or GIN mice; Oliva et al., 2000Oliva Jr., A.A. Jiang M. Lam T. Smith K.L. Swann J.W. Novel hippocampal interneuronal subtypes identified using transgenic mice that express green fluorescent protein in GABAergic interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3354-3368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were crossbred with APP/PS1 transgenic mice that served as a model for AD (Jankowsky et al., 2004Jankowsky J.L. Fadale D.J. Anderson J. Xu G.M. Gonzales V. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Lee M.K. Younkin L.H. Wagner S.L. et al.Mutant presenilins specifically elevate the levels of the 42 residue beta-amyloid peptide in vivo: evidence for augmentation of a 42-specific gamma secretase.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). In Gad1-eGFP mice, the majority of eGFP-expressing inhibitory neurons were SST positive, but only rarely PV positive (Oliva et al., 2000Oliva Jr., A.A. Jiang M. Lam T. Smith K.L. Swann J.W. Novel hippocampal interneuronal subtypes identified using transgenic mice that express green fluorescent protein in GABAergic interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3354-3368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We carried out double immunofluorescence labeling and found a similar distribution (Figures S1A and S1B, available online). To monitor structural changes of eGFP-positive inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus, we carried out two-photon in vivo imaging through a cranial window that was surgically implanted above the right dorsal hippocampus (Figure 1; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). From 4 to 5 months of age, mice were imaged weekly and subsequently in monthly intervals up to the age of 11 months (Figure 1A). We visualized eGFP-positive inhibitory neurons and their dendrites and axons in different layers of the hippocampal CA1 region ranging from stratum oriens (SO) through stratum pyramidale (SP), and stratum radiatum (SR) to stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) (Figures 1B and 1C). Based on the SST expression, their cell body location in SO, their characteristic morphology with a horizontally oriented dendritic tree in SO, and axonal projections to SLM, the majority of eGFP-positive inhibitory neurons were putative O-LM interneurons (Figures 1C, 1D, S1A, and S1B). Although inhibitory neurons are generally aspiny, O-LM interneurons have been shown to carry spines on their dendrites (Freund and Buzsáki, 1996Freund T.F. Buzsáki G. Interneurons of the hippocampus.Hippocampus. 1996; 6: 347-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Guirado et al., 2014Guirado R. Perez-Rando M. Sanchez-Matarredona D. Castillo-Gómez E. Liberia T.

Novel hippocampal interneuronal subtypes identified using transgenic mice that express green fluorescent protein in GABAergic interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3354-3368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether the imaged axonal boutons and dendritic spines were structural correlates of synapses, we carried out immunofluorescence labeling with synaptic markers. We found that 82.4% ± 3.6% of boutons were positive for vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) and 69.1% ± 3.8% of spines localized with postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) (Figures S1C–S1E). Moreover, we retrieved dendritic spines after in vivo imaging in fixed brain slices (Supplemental Experimental Procedures) and labeled them with VGluT2 (Figure S1F). Indeed, the in vivo recorded dendritic spines were found in close proximity to VGluT2-positive excitatory pre-synapses. Next to eGFP-positive interneurons, depositions of fibrillar Aβ were stained with the dye MethoxyX04 (MeX04; Figure 1D), which was previously shown to label Aβ plaques in the cortex in vivo (Bittner et al., 2012Bittner T. Burgold S. Dorostkar M.M. Fuhrmann M. Wegenast-Braun B.M. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H. Herms J.

In vivo multiphoton imaging reveals gradual growth of newborn amyloid plaques over weeks.Acta Neuropathol. 2011; 121: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We found that Aβ plaque deposition in the hippocampal layers SO and SLM started at 4–6 months and increased with age (Figures 1D and 1E). Additionally, we analyzed the survival rate of eGFP-positive interneurons in wild-type and APP/PS1 mice. We found an age-dependent decrease of eGFP-positive interneurons that was independent of Aβ pathology (Figure S1G). These data confirm that in vivo imaged axonal boutons and dendritic spines are morphological correlates of pre- and post-synapses of eGFP-positive inhibitory neurons. Impaired structural plasticity of excitatory synapses has been described in different mouse models of AD (Bittner et al., 2010Bittner T. Fuhrmann M. Burgold S. Ochs S.M. Hoffmann N. Mitteregger G.

Fibrillar amyloid deposition leads to local synaptic abnormalities and breakage of neuronal branches.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1181-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Moreover, the kinetics of excitatory axonal bouton remodeling in relation to Aβ plaques have been analyzed (Liebscher et al., 2014Liebscher S. Page R.M. Käfer K. Winkler E. Quinn K. Goldbach E. Brigham E.F. Quincy D. Basi G.S. Schenk D.B. et al.Chronic γ-secretase inhibition reduces amyloid plaque-associated instability of pre- and postsynaptic structures.Mol. Psychiatry. 2014; 19: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Whereas these studies focused on excitatory neurons in the cortex, it remains unknown whether the structural plasticity of synapses on inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus is similarly affected in animal models of AD. Therefore, we next investigated synapse remodeling of hippocampal GABAergic interneurons and analyzed the effect of increased amyloidosis. We monitored GABAergic boutons in SLM monthly from 4 to 11 months of age by repetitively retrieving the same axons and boutons in wild-type and APP/PS1 mice (Figure 2). We identified the identical imaging position over time on the basis of individual branch patterns of eGFP-positive axons in SLM (Figure 2A). In wild-type mice, most axons persisted during the entire observation period, while in APP/PS1 mice, we detected a loss of axonal structures (Figures 2B and 2C). We found a significantly decreased axon survival rate in APP/PS1 compared with wild-type mice (Figures 2D and 2E). Only half of these lost axonal segments (47.4%) were in close proximity (<50 μm) to Aβ plaques (Figure 2F), indicating an Aβ plaque proximity-independent effect. The bouton density remained constant in wild-type (∼0.31 boutons/μm) as well as on persistently present axons in APP/PS1 mice (∼0.31 boutons/μm; Figure 2G). Axonal segments had a similar bouton density prior to loss, whereas the loss of an axonal segment was accompanied by removal of boutons belonging to the axon (Figures 2H and 2I). The density of gained and lost boutons was independent of age and similar between persistent axons of wild-type and APP/PS1 mice (Figures S2A–S2C). Since synapse loss represents one of the earliest signs in AD, we wondered whether deficits of GABAergic boutons were already present at young ages. Therefore, we carried out weekly imaging in 4-month-old mice (Figures S2D–S2K). Similar to aged mice, young APP/PS1 mice exhibited axon loss (Figure S2F), leading to a significantly decreased axon survival rate in APP/PS1 mice compared to wild-type mice (Figures S2G and S2H). Corresponding to the monthly intervals, persistent axons in young APP/PS1 mice showed equal numbers of gained and lost boutons similar to age-matched wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that structural plasticity of inhibitory axonal boutons in the hippocampus is well preserved with aging even in APP/PS1 mice. However, the similar loss of axonal segments close and distant to Aβ plaques, as well as the loss of axons in young mice, argues for an Aβ plaque proximity-independent effect. In summary, these data indicate structural impairment of O-LM interneuron axons in APP/PS1 mice. So far, we have shown structural plasticity of GABAergic boutons in the hippocampus and the progressive loss of axonal segments in APP/PS1 mice. The inhibitory output of GABAergic neurons depends on received input that is integrated on their dendrites. As described before, O-LM interneurons carry dendritic spines that are important for input integration and information processing. Altered remodeling of dendritic spines on O-LM interneurons might indicate impaired network rewiring contributing to network dysfunction. Therefore, we repetitively imaged individual dendritic elements of eGFP-positive O-LM interneurons in SO over a period of 7 months in wild-type and APP/PS1 mice. (Figures 3A and 3B ). In contrast to axons, we did not observe any loss of dendrites throughout the observation period. The spine density on O-LM interneurons increased by 12% with age in wild-type mice, but stayed constant in APP/PS1 transgenic mice (Figures 3C and 3D). Regardless of the genotype, the gained and lost spine densities declined from 5 to 11 months (Figures 3C and 3D). Aberrant structural plasticity of spines on dendrites of pyramidal cells has been shown to preferentially take place in proximity to Aβ plaques (Bittner et al., 2010Bittner T. Fuhrmann M. Burgold S. Ochs S.M. Hoffmann N. Mitteregger G. Kretzschmar H. LaFerla F.M. Herms J. Multiple events lead to dendritic spine loss in triple transgenic Alzheimer’s disease mice.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e15477Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, Bittner et al., 2012Bittner T. Burgold S. Dorostkar M.M. Fuhrmann M. Wegenast-Braun B.M. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H. Herms J. Amyloid plaque formation precedes dendritic spine loss.Acta Neuropathol. 2012; 124: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As Aβ deposition increases with age (Figure 1E), the average distance of analyzed dendrites to the closest plaque decreased from 80 μm at 7 months to 28 μm at 11 months (Figure S3A). Therefore, we analyzed whether there was a relationship between spine density and Aβ plaque proximity. Indeed, the spine density on dendrites closer than 50 μm to an Aβ plaque was decreased compared to dendrites farther than 50 μm and to wild-type mice (Figure 3E). When analyzing the structural plasticity, we found that it was dependent on age, with a significantly higher turnover rate, as well as density of gained, but not lost, spines in young (5–6 months) compared to old (7–11 months) wild-type animals (Figures 3F, 3G, S3B, and S3C). The turnover rate was likewise decreased with age in APP/PS1 mice (Figure 3G). In young mice, the turnover rate as well as densities of gained and lost spines were similar in wild-type and APP/PS1 mice, whereas the turnover rate and the density of lost spines were significantly increased in old APP/PS1 compared to old wild-type animals (Figures 3F, 3G, S3B, and S3C). While the synapse turnover on dendrites with a distance greater than 50 μm to an Aβ plaque was slightly, but not significantly, increased compared to wild-type, the turnover rate significantly increased with proximity (smaller than 50 μm) to Aβ depositions (Figure 3G). Corresponding to the turnover rate, the density of persistent spines increased significantly with age in wild-type mice (Figures S3D and S3E). Old APP/PS1 mice exhibited a significantly decreased density of persistent spines compared to wild-type animals, mainly due to a reduced density close to Aβ plaques (Figure S3E). We additionally carried out weekly imaging of dendritic spines over a period of 5 weeks in 4-month-old mice. Besides a minor genotype-independent increase in spine density, no significant differences were found between wild-type and APP/PS1 mice regarding density, loss, gain, and turnover of spines (Figures S3F–S3L). These data show that O-LM interneurons exhibit an age-dependent increase of dendritic spines that is absent in APP/PS1 mice and decreased spine density in proximity to Aβ plaques. Furthermore, the turnover rate of dendritic spines on O-LM interneurons decreases with age. Old APP/PS1 mice exhibit a significantly increased turnover compared to wild-type that further increases with proximity to Aβ plaques. Overall, this points to an impaired stability of afferent synapses on O-LM interneurons in APP/PS1 mice. Since we identified age- and Aβ plaque-dependent impairments of structural plasticity of dendritic spines on O-LM interneurons in APP/PS1 mice, we next investigated whether rewiring was affected during memory formation. To test hippocampus-dependent learning, we chose contextual fear conditioning (FC). We carried out two-photon in vivo imaging on three consecutive time points with 4-day intervals (Figure 4A). Between the imaging sessions, the mice were only exposed to their home cages. From this baseline period (BL), we acquired the baseline gain and loss of axonal boutons and dendritic spines of O-LM interneurons in the hippocampus. Subsequently, during the learning and memory phase (L&M), mice were exposed to FC 24 hr after the first imaging time point and re-exposed to the context for memory retrieval (RE) 24 hr after the second imaging time point (Figures 4A and 4B). As reported before (Kilgore et al., 2010Kilgore M. Miller C.A. Fass D.M. Hennig K.M. Haggarty S.J. Sweatt J.D. Rumbaugh G. Inhibitors of class 1 histone deacetylases reverse contextual memory deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2010; 35: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), APP/PS1 mice only partially recalled the context and exhibited significantly decreased freezing rates compared to wild-type mice (Figure 4B). On the synaptic level, we found significantly more gained spines after FC compared with BL in wild-type, but not APP/PS1, mice (Figures 4C, 4D, an"

This has led to the emerging idea that conformational dynamics are central to ligand recognition, activation, and signaling by GCPRs. However, little is known about the impact of oligomerization on GPCR conformational dynamics and whether or how this confers cooperativity onto signaling. Despite the interest in GPCR oligomerization, complexes have been difficult to observe and analyze structurally or biophysically within the class A and class B families of GPCRs (Vischer et al., 2015Vischer H.F.

Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are class C GPCRs that modulate synaptic strength and serve as drug targets for neurological disorders (Niswender and Conn, 2010Niswender C.M. Conn P.J. Metabotropic glutamate receptors: physiology, pharmacology, and disease.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2010; 50: 295-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). mGluRs consist of three domains: an N-terminal bi-lobed LBD, a seven-helix transmembrane domain (TMD), and a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that links the LBD to the TMD. Dimerization of full-length mGluRs is required for G protein activation (El Moustaine et al., 2012El Moustaine D. Granier S. Doumazane E. Scholler P. Rahmeh R. Bron P. Mouillac B. Banères J.L.

Biochemical and spectroscopic studies have shown that activation coincides with intersubunit reorientation of both the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the receptor (Doumazane et al., 2013Doumazane E.

Major ligand-induced rearrangement of the heptahelical domain interface in a GPCR dimer.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of dimerization and the role of dimer interfaces in activation, intersubunit communication, and mGluR function are not clear. In this study, we use quantitative subunit counting to find that mGluR homo- and heterodimerization depends primarily on interactions at a hydrophobic interface in the upper lobe of the LBD, with modest contributions from an intersubunit disulfide bridge and TMD interaction. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) enables us to quantify the contribution of interface hotspots to global conformational dynamics. An approach to targeted single-subunit activation, using photoswitchable tethered ligands (PTLs) in dimers of defined stoichiometry, enables us to unravel the mechanism of cooperativity in mGluR activation. We find that cooperativity in dimers gives rise to boosted activity and that heterodimerization gives rise to the emergence of unique biochemical properties. Our observations lead to a model of mGluR gating that accounts for cooperativity in basal activity in the absence of agonist, as well as partial and full activation across the concentration range of agonist in both homo- and heterodimers. Previous studies of mGluR oligomerization employed classical biochemical methods to assay denatured proteins in vitro (Ray and Hauschild, 2000Ray K. Hauschild B.C.

A new approach to analyze cell surface protein complexes reveals specific heterodimeric metabotropic glutamate receptors.FASEB J. 2011; 25: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To analyze mGluR stoichiometry, we used single-molecule subunit imaging of individual protein complexes to count photobleaching steps in GFP-tagged receptors. We expressed a C-terminally GFP-tagged mGluR2 (mGluR2-GFP) in Xenopus oocytes at low density to ensure that individual complexes would be spatially resolved as individual fluorescent spots (Figure 1A; Figure S1A). Using total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy to confine excitation to the plasma membrane, we observed GFP photobleaching (Figure 1B) and found that all spots bleached in one or two steps, with ∼60% bleaching in two steps (Figure 1C; Figure S1A). This is consistent with mGluR2 being a dimer, with a probability of ∼0.7 that its GFP is fluorescent (Figure S1A) due to 20%–30% of GFPs that either mis-fold or fail to undergo chromophore maturation (Nakajo et al., 2010Nakajo K. Ulbrich M.H. Kubo Y. Isacoff E.Y. Stoichiometry of the KCNQ1 - KCNE1 ion channel complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 18862-18867Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007Ulbrich M.H. Isacoff E.Y. Subunit counting in membrane-bound proteins.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Importantly, mGluR2-GFP proved to be functional, supporting glutamate-induced currents from co-expressed G protein-activated inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channels (Figure S1A). Similar photobleaching distributions were obtained with GFP-tagged versions of mGluR3 (group II), mGluR7 (group III), and mGluR1 and mGluR5 (group I), and each of these was also functional, producing glutamate-induced GIRK current (mGluR3 and mGluR7) or calcium-activated chloride current (mGluR1 and mGluR5) (Figures S1B–S1E). We next asked which domains mediate dimerization. We truncated mGluR2-GFP by removing only the LBD (ΔLBD-GFP) or the entire extracellular domain (ΔECD-GFP). In both cases, we observed a near-complete reduction in two-step photobleaching (Figure 1C; Figures S1F and S1G), indicating that the extracellular domain, particularly the LBD, is required for efficient dimerization. Subunit counting in Xenopus oocytes requires low expression levels in order to resolve single molecules in the plasma membrane. To analyze stoichiometry under high-density expression, we expressed mGluR2-GFP under the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in HEK293T cells (Figure S1H) and isolated receptors in detergent using the SimPull technique (Jain et al., 2011Jain A. Liu R. Ramani B. Arauz E. Ishitsuka Y. Ragunathan K. Park J. Chen J. Xiang Y.K. Ha T. Probing cellular protein complexes using single-molecule pull-down.Nature. 2011; 473: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) to obtain a low density of immune-purified protein on a passivated surface (Figure 1D) (Vafabakhsh et al., 2015Vafabakhsh R. Levitz J. Isacoff E.Y. Conformational dynamics of a class C G-protein-coupled receptor.Nature. 2015; 524: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Consistent with results from oocytes, ∼60% of mGluR2-GFP spots bleached in two steps in SimPull (Figure S1H). ΔECD-GFP expressed at lower levels and had poorer surface localization compared to mGluR2-GFP (Figure S1I). Interestingly, although deletion of the extracellular domain reduced two-step photobleaching (Figure 1F; Figure S1I), this reduction was less extreme than what was seen in Xenopus oocytes (Figure 1C). ΔECD-GFP constructs for both mGluR3 and mGluR1 showed a similar behavior (Figure S1J). These observations suggest that, at the high expression density obtained in HEK293T cells, parts of the protein other than the ECD contribute to dimerization. This interpretation was supported by the finding that SimPull from oocytes injected with 100-fold higher levels of RNA for ΔECD-GFP leads to an increase in the percentage of two-step photobleaching spots (∼30% versus <5%) (Figure S1K). To further probe the roles of the LBD and the TMD in dimerization, we examined the ability of truncated domains to co-assemble with full-length mGluR2. Co-expression of either “GFP-LBD” or “TMD-GFP” (ΔECD-mGluR2-GFP) with full-length hemagglutinin (HA)-mGluR2 followed by SimPull with anti-HA antibodies led to immobilization of GFP spots (Figures 1G and 1H) with more efficient co-assembly of mGluR2 with the isolated LBD than with the isolated TMD (Figure 1I). Most spots bleached in a single step, confirming that one full-length mGluR2 subunit co-assembles with a single isolated domain (92.4% ± 0.1% for GFP-LBD and 89.6% ± 0.8% for TMD-GFP). These experiments confirm that the primary dimer interface is the LBD, with the TMD representing a secondary interface. Given the primary role of the LBD in dimerization, we investigated the inter-LBD dimer interface by examining crystal structures of the isolated LBDs of mGluRs (Figure 2A) (Kunishima et al., 2000Kunishima N.

In both the relaxed and active states, a cluster of conserved hydrophobic residues in helices B and C lie at an interface between the upper LBD lobes (LB1) (Figure 2A; Figures S2A and S2B). In the active state, an additional interface is observed between conserved charged residues in the lower LBD lobes (LB2), where Gd3+ has been shown to bind in mGluR1 (Tsuchiya et al., 2002Tsuchiya D.

Furthermore, a conserved cysteine (C121 in mGluR2), located in the structurally unresolved loop between helices B and C, has been shown to be crucial for dimerization in denaturing gels (Ray and Hauschild, 2000Ray K.

Consistent with the weak effect of C121, application of DTT, to reduce a potential intersubunit disulfide bond, did not alter receptor stoichiometry in wild-type (WT) mGluR2-GFP (Figure S2E). However, in the background of the single mutation F158A to the hydrophobic LB1 interface, the additional mutation of C121A further reduced dimerization (Figure 2B). In contrast, LB2 mutants E218A and K240A did not significantly alter dimerization (Figure 2B). Under high-density expression in HEK293T cells, followed by SimPull purification, dimerization was only reduced when all three LB1 mutations (“3xLB1”) were combined with the C121A mutation (Figure 2C). We also analyzed expression and surface targeting of dimer interface mutants using confocal imaging. C-terminally GFP-tagged versions of mGluR2WT, 3xLB1, C121A, and 3xLB1/C121A showed clear membrane enrichment and similar levels of fluorescence (Figure S2F). We quantified surface targeting with membrane-impermeable dye conjugation to N-terminally SNAP-tagged variants and found similar levels for all variants tested (Figures S2G and S2H). Together, these experiments show that dimerization is mediated primarily by the hydrophobic LB1 interface, along with a weak contribution from a covalent intersubunit disulfide bridge and little contribution from the LB2 interface. We next asked how the LBD dimer interfaces affect receptor function by recording glutamate-evoked currents from HEK293T cells co-expressing WT or mutant versions of mGluR2 along with the GIRK channel. Interestingly, we found that the mGluR2-C121A mutation reduced apparent glutamate affinity (Figure S2I), whereas weakening of the LB1 interface with the triple mutant 3xLB1 increased apparent glutamate affinity (Figure S2I). To directly measure the activation-associated conformational changes of the LBDs, we performed an ensemble intersubunit FRET assay in HEK293T cells using mGluRs that were fused at their N terminus to SNAP- or CLIP-tags and conjugated to acceptor (Alexa 647) or donor (DY-547) fluorophores (Doumazane et al., 2013Doumazane E. Scholler P. Fabre L. Zwier J.M. Trinquet E. Pin J.P. Rondard P. Illuminating the activation mechanisms and allosteric properties of metabotropic glutamate receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E1416-E1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), respectively. As shown earlier, glutamate binding induces closure and reorientation of the LBD that increase distance between the fluorophores, thus reducing FRET (Doumazane et al., 2013Doumazane E. Scholler P. Fabre L. Zwier J.M. Trinquet E. Pin J.P. Rondard P. Illuminating the activation mechanisms and allosteric properties of metabotropic glutamate receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E1416-E1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Consistent with the GIRK assay, glutamate dose-response curves of the conformational changes associated with activation revealed that the C121A mutant reduces apparent affinity and the 3xLB1 triple mutant increases apparent affinity (Figures 2D and 2E; Figure S2J). Neutralization of charged residues on helix F in the LB2 interface also had an effect: K240A strongly decreased the apparent glutamate affinity, as recently reported (Vafabakhsh et al., 2015Vafabakhsh R. Levitz J. Isacoff E.Y. Conformational dynamics of a class C G-protein-coupled receptor.Nature. 2015; 524: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), while E213A, E218A, and E222A weakly increased apparent affinity (Figure 2E; Figures S2K and S2L) (unpaired t test with mGluR2; p = 0.0034 for E213A, p = 0.0037 for E218A, and p = 0.28 for E222A). To better understand the role of the dimer interfaces in activation, we turned to single-molecule FRET (smFRET), which recently revealed that group II mGluRs transition between three states with distinct FRET efficiencies: ∼0.45 (“high”), ∼0.35 (“medium”), and ∼0.2 (“low”), with the low FRET state corresponding to the active conformation (Vafabakhsh et al., 2015Vafabakhsh R. Levitz J. Isacoff E.Y. Conformational dynamics of a class C G-protein-coupled receptor.Nature. 2015; 524: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As seen before, in the absence of glutamate, mGluR2WT shows few transitions out of the high FRET state and, in saturating glutamate, few transitions out of the low FRET state, but at intermediate concentrations, it shows rapid dynamics (Figures S3A–S3C). In contrast, in the absence of glutamate, mGluR2-3xLB1 showed transitions from the inactive high FRET state to the intermediate and low FRET states (Figure 3A), with predominant occupancy of the activated state (Figure 3B). Glutamate application further increased occupancy of the low FRET state (Figure S3D), fully occupying it at saturating concentrations (Figure 3B) and, similar to mGluR2WT, abolishing dynamics, as measured by donor and acceptor cross-correlation (Figure S3E). Interestingly, this lowest FRET state of mGluR2(3xLB1) was lower in FRET than what was observed in mGluR2WT (Figure 3B; Figure S3F), suggesting that 3xLB1 stabilizes a state with increased degrees of LBD closure and/or dimer reorientation. These observations suggest that the hydrophobic LB1 interface provides energy to prevent spontaneous LBD closure and dimer reorientation in the absence of agonist. In contrast, in the absence of glutamate, mGluR2(C121A) displayed minimal dynamics and was shifted to a higher peak FRET of the inactive conformation (∼0.6 versus ∼0.45; Figures 3C and 3D). Application of glutamate increased the population of the low FRET conformation but with a lower apparent affinity than seen in WT mGluR2 (Figure 3D; Figures S3G and S3H). Even in saturating glutamate (10 mM), mGluR2(C121A) showed dynamics out of the low FRET state (Figure 3C, bottom; Figure S3I). These observations suggest that the intersubunit disulfide bridge primes the resting conformation for the activation rearrangement and stabilizes the active state. To further examine the differences between the hydrophobic LB1 (3xLB1) and covalent (“C121A”) interfaces, we performed smFRET experiments with the partial agonist DCG-IV, which we previously showed to have partial efficacy due to partial active state occupancy at saturating concentrations (Vafabakhsh et al., 2015Vafabakhsh R. Levitz J. Isacoff E.Y. Conformational dynamics of a class C G-protein-coupled receptor.Nature. 2015; 524: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Compared to mGluR2WT, at saturating DCG-IV, mGluR2(C121A) showed a much reduced occupancy of the low FRET state, while mGluR2(3xLB1) showed a greater low FRET state occupancy (Figures 3E and 3F). Consistent with this, dynamics at saturating DCG-IV were abolished in mGluR2(3xLB1) and increased in mGluR2(C121A) (Figures 3E and 3G). These results support the interpretation that the active state is stabilized by the 3xLB1 mutation and destabilized by the C121A mutation. We also measured smFRET from the mGluR2(3xLB1/C121A) quadruple mutant. Similar to mGluR2(3xLB1), the quadruple mutant showed spontaneous dynamics, including visits to the active state (Figures S3J and S3K), indicating that an intact disulfide bond is not required for the introduction of basal conformational dynamics by the 3xLB1 mutant. However, like mGluR2(C121A), the quadruple mutant showed an increase in FRET values associated with inactive states, as well as incomplete population of the active state in saturating glutamate (Figures S3J and S3K). In saturating DCG-IV, mGluR2(3xLB1/C121A) populated the low FRET state at a level intermediate between that of the 3xLB1 or C121A mutant alone (Figure S3M) and had a slight decrease in low FRET peak value, similar to 3xLB1 (Figure S3M). Together, these observations indicate that mutations to LB1 and the disulfide interface have effects that do not occlude one another, sug"

Our findings reveal molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms of NRG1/ErbB4 in regulating the initiation of critical period visual cortical plasticity. Synaptic plasticity of neural circuits is a required feature of learning, memory, and similar cognitive processes. Neural circuitry in the brain is shaped by experience, most profoundly during “critical periods” in early postnatal life. Experience-dependent critical period plasticity has been extensively studied in the visual cortex (Hensch, 2005Hensch T.K. Critical period plasticity in local cortical circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Adjustments of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strength are believed to be a major mechanism by which cortical networks adapt to sensory input over a range of timescales from seconds to days (D’amour and Froemke, 2015D’amour J.A.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3304-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Changes in cortical inhibition exerted by inhibitory interneurons are essential for regulating the critical period of visual development. Recently, fast-spiking, parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons (referred to as PV neurons) have been identified as the initial locus for critical period cortical plasticity (Kuhlman et al., 2013Kuhlman S.J. Olivas N.D. Tring E. Ikrar T. Xu X. Trachtenberg J.T. A disinhibitory microcircuit initiates critical-period plasticity in the visual cortex.Nature. 2013; 501: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). PV neurons are rapidly inhibited by visual deprivation via monocular eyelid suture during the critical period, which is attributed to a decrease in local excitatory circuit inputs onto these interneurons (Kuhlman et al., 2013Kuhlman S.J. Olivas N.D. Tring E. Ikrar T. Xu X. Trachtenberg J.T. A disinhibitory microcircuit initiates critical-period plasticity in the visual cortex.Nature. 2013; 501: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The initial and transient reduction of PV cell activity establishes the conditions necessary for the experience-dependent excitatory cortical plasticity (i.e., ocular dominance plasticity). While progress has been made to understand specific neuronal types in driving critical period plasticity, the molecular mechanisms that translate brief sensory deprivation into functional changes in circuit connections remain unresolved. Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) is essential for the normal development of the nervous system, and signaling through its tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB4 has been implicated in synaptic plasticity associated with long-term potentiation (LTP) and GABAergic circuit development (Fazzari et al., 2010Fazzari P. Paternain A.V. Valiente M. Pla R. Luján R. Lloyd K. Lerma J. Marín O. Rico B.

We tested whether NRG1/ErbB4 signaling regulates functional circuit connections of PV interneurons and excitatory neurons during the critical period of visual development. Here we show that NRG1/ErbB4 signaling rapidly controls excitatory synaptic inputs onto PV neurons and thus PV-cell-mediated cortical inhibition in response to visual deprivation. Our study establishes molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms of NRG1/ErbB4 in regulating the initiation of critical period visual cortical plasticity. To determine how sensory experience is transduced into a loss of excitatory inputs to PV interneurons, we examined developmental expression and experience-dependent regulation of NRG1/ErbB4 signaling. We focused on layer 2/3 (L2/3) PV neurons in the binocular zone of mouse primary visual cortex (V1), where a reduction in PV cell firing rates and disinhibition of upper layer excitatory neurons occurs during the initial stage of critical period ocular dominance plasticity. To genetically label PV neurons, we crossed PV-IRES-Cre mice (Hippenmeyer et al., 2005Hippenmeyer S. Vrieseling E. Sigrist M. Portmann T. Laengle C. Ladle D.R. Arber S. A developmental switch in the response of DRG neurons to ETS transcription factor signaling.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e159Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) with Ai9 tdTomato reporter mice (Madisen et al., 2010Madisen L. Zwingman T.A. Sunkin S.M. Oh S.W. Zariwala H.A. Gu H. Ng L.L. Palmiter R.D. Hawrylycz M.J. Jones A.R. et al.A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3867) Google Scholar). NRG1 and ErbB4 expression in PV neurons is developmentally regulated. ErbB4 expression in the visual cortex precedes PV expression (Figures 1A–1C). PV neurons show strong ErbB4 expression during the critical period of mouse visual development, as defined by ocular dominance plasticity. The ErbB4-expressing cells form a major subset of GABAergic neurons in visual cortex (Figure S1). NRG1 expression in the brain has been mapped using in situ hybridization (Liu et al., 2011Liu X. Bates R. Yin D.M. Shen C. Wang F. Su N. Kirov S.A. Luo Y. Wang J.Z. Xiong W.C. Mei L. Specific regulation of NRG1 isoform expression by neuronal activity.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 8491-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar); however, no studies have determined whether PV inhibitory neurons express NRG1. To determine this, we performed NRG1 immunostaining in visual cortical sections. PV neurons have strong and concentrated NRG1 expression revealed by immunostaining; this distinguishes them from surrounding putative excitatory neurons (Figure 1D). The stronger expression of NRG1 by PV neurons is confirmed with cell-specific fsTRAP analysis (Figure S2); the NRG1 mRNA expression in PV neurons is on average 170-fold higher as compared with excitatory neurons targeted by using Emx1-Cre mice. Importantly, the developmental expression of NRG1 in PV cells peaks at the critical period and correlates with the time course of critical period ocular dominance plasticity in mouse visual cortex (Figures 1A, 1B, 1D, and 1E). A great majority of PV neurons are immunopositive for NRG1. The average percentage of NRG1-expressing PV cells in L2/3 of mouse V1 is 92.5% during the critical period peak. The co-expression of the ligand NRG1 and its receptor ErbB4 in PV neurons may allow these neurons to regulate their synaptic plasticity through activity-dependent NRG1/ErbB4 signaling. Consistent with our previous finding that firing rates of PV neurons in binocular visual cortex are rapidly inhibited with 1-day monocular deprivation (Kuhlman et al., 2013Kuhlman S.J. Olivas N.D. Tring E. Ikrar T. Xu X. Trachtenberg J.T. A disinhibitory microcircuit initiates critical-period plasticity in the visual cortex.Nature. 2013; 501: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), visual deprivation reduces NRG1 expression for both mRNA (Figures 2A and 2B ) and protein levels (Figures 2C and 2D) in PV neurons. Monocular deprivation also decreases the levels of activated ErbB4 (as measured by phospho-specific ErbB4 immunostaining) and overall phosphotyrosine levels in PV neurons (Figures 2C, 2D, and 2G–2I). In contrast, brief visual deprivation has no effect on NRG1 expression in putative excitatory neurons (Figure 2J). Thus, the acute and selective downregulation of NRG1 signaling in PV neurons induced by sensory deprivation is a candidate for the molecular basis of the rapid retraction of excitatory inputs to these cells and their reduced spiking activity. To further address the activity-dependent control of NRG1 expression by PV neurons, we functionally mimicked monocular deprivation effects by using Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) (Sternson and Roth, 2014Sternson S.M. Roth B.L. Chemogenetic tools to interrogate brain functions.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 37: 387-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) to inhibit PV neuronal activity in vivo for 24 hr. We find that reduced PV neuronal activity evoked by 24 hr DREADDs treatment phenocopies the decreased NRG1 expression in the same targeted cells seen after 24 hr of monocular deprivation (Figures 2F and 2K). To determine whether ErbB4 activation is important for NRG1 expression in PV neurons, we acutely treated the mouse cortex with an ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 for less than 24 hr through intracerebroventricular injection. ErbB receptor inhibition decreases NRG1 expression in PV neurons in AG1478-treated animals (Figure 2L). We reasoned that exogenous NRG1 treatment should reverse the physiological impact of visual deprivation on PV cells. As shown in Figure 2, NRG1/ErbB4 signaling in deprived PV cells in visual cortex is upregulated through exogenous NRG1 treatment via subcutaneous administration of recombinant NRG1 containing only the EGF core domain of NRG1-β1. This form of NRG1 has been shown previously to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and functionally activate ErbB4 in the cortex (Abe et al., 2011Abe Y. Namba H. Kato T. Iwakura Y. Nawa H. Neuregulin-1 signals from the periphery regulate AMPA receptor sensitivity and expression in GABAergic interneurons in developing neocortex.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 5699-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Exogenous NRG1 treatment results in significantly increased immunostaining of NRG1 and increased phosphorylation of ErbB4 and protein tyrosine phosphorylation in PV cells in binocular visual cortex despite monocular deprivation (Figures 2E and 2G–2I). These findings indicate that systemic administration of NRG1 can be used to override the effects of monocular deprivation and independently manipulate NRG1 signaling in visual cortex to test functional outcomes in vivo. To examine the causal link between decreased NRG1 signaling and the loss of excitatory inputs to PV cells, we tested the effects of NRG1 treatment on PV cell inputs following visual monocular deprivation. We predicted that enhancing NRG1 signaling would enhance excitatory inputs to deprived PV cells in L2/3 of visual cortex. We measured the connectivity strength and laminar distribution of presynaptic excitatory inputs onto L2/3 PV neurons in brain slices taken from binocular visual cortex of critical period mice (postnatal days 27–30 [P27–P30]) using laser-scanning photo stimulation (LSPS) via glutamate uncaging (Kuhlman et al., 2013Kuhlman S.J. Olivas N.D. Tring E. Ikrar T. Xu X. Trachtenberg J.T. A disinhibitory microcircuit initiates critical-period plasticity in the visual cortex.Nature. 2013; 501: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, Xu et al., 2016Xu X. Olivas N.D. Ikrar T. Peng T. Holmes T.C. Nie Q. Shi Y. Primary visual cortex shows laminar-specific and balanced circuit organization of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connectivity.J. Physiol. 2016; 594: 1891-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A; Figure S3). The LSPS approach is effective for detailed local circuit mapping. It involves first recording from a single neuron, then sequentially stimulating at surrounding sites to evoke action potentials from neurons in those sites through spatially restricted optically evoked glutamate release; recording from the potential postsynaptic neuron allows one to determine whether there are actual synaptic inputs from those stimulation sites. Physiological mapping experiments were performed in both normal and deprived mouse V1 slices. Normal PV neurons receive strong local excitatory inputs from L4 and upper L5 and as well as from L2/3; their inputs are dramatically reduced following 1–2 day monocular visual deprivation (Kuhlman et al., 2013Kuhlman S.J. Olivas N.D. Tring E. Ikrar T. Xu X. Trachtenberg J.T. A disinhibitory microcircuit initiates critical-period plasticity in the visual cortex.Nature. 2013; 501: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) (Figures 3B and 3D). To test our prediction that enhancing NRG1 signaling specifically enhances excitatory inputs to deprived PV cells, we examined whether enhanced NRG1 signaling restores normal excitatory drive onto these PV cells. Exogenous NRG1 treatment does not alter resting membrane potential or intrinsic membrane excitability in PV cells under normal or monocular deprivation conditions (Figure S4; Table S1); thus, intrinsic neuronal properties are not the locus for NRG1 effects. Further, acute bath application of recombinant NRG1 does not significantly modulate local excitatory synaptic inputs or direct uncaging responses of control PV neurons in binocular V1 of normal, non-lid sutured PV-Cre; Ai9 mice (Figures 3B, 3C, and 3K). This suggests that NRG1 signaling is sufficiently high to maintain synaptic input to normal PV neurons during the critical period. In contrast, bath NRG1 rapidly increases the amplitude of excitatory synaptic input to 1–2 day deprived PV cells (Figures 3D–3G and 3J; Table S2). Bath-applied NRG1 greatly potentiates direct glutamate-evoked responses as measured by responses to uncaging at perisomatic regions of PV cells. The NRG1 effects on direct responses are similar with and without the co-application of tetrodotoxin (TTX) that blocks evoked synaptic inputs (Figure 3K; Figure S5). These NRG1-enhanced responses are supported by previous studies (Abe et al., 2011Abe Y. Namba H. Kato T. Iwakura Y. Nawa H. Neuregulin-1 signals from the periphery regulate AMPA receptor sensitivity and expression in GABAergic interneurons in developing neocortex.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 5699-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, Tamura et al., 2012Tamura H. Kawata M. Hamaguchi S. Ishikawa Y. Shiosaka S. Processing of neuregulin-1 by neuropsin regulates GABAergic neuron to control neural plasticity of the mouse hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 12657-12672Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and further confirmed by the finding that NRG1 treatment increases glutamate-evoked spiking in monocular-deprived PV neurons (Figure S6). Bath NRG1 effects are robust with a fast time course (Figure 3G). The response increases are clearly detectable within 10 min and reach a plateau around 20 min following NRG1 bath application. NRG1 potentiation persists with long duration in the continued presence of the peptide, but its effects are quickly and completely eliminated within 30 min of washout. The excitation-enhancing effects of NRG1 on deprived PV neurons are concentration dependent. We chose 5 nM bath NRG1 for slice mapping experiments based on a calibrated dose-response curve. This concentration is consistent with the physiological range of cortical NRG1 concentration (Liu et al., 2011Liu X. Bates R. Yin D.M. Shen C. Wang F. Su N. Kirov S.A. Luo Y. Wang J.Z. Xiong W.C. Mei L. Specific regulation of NRG1 isoform expression by neuronal activity.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 8491-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Desensitization of bath-applied NRG1 is not seen in recordings of longer duration; NRG1 potentiation is seen with repeated cycles of washout followed by NRG1 re-applications on the same deprived PV neurons. Thus, this indicates that NRG1 signaling strongly enhances glutamate-mediated responsiveness to restore excitatory synaptic transmission in an acute fashion rather than by initiating a long-lasting modulation process. The effects of bath-administered NRG1 on excitatory inputs to deprived PV neurons are also observed in recordings of brain slices from animals treated with subcutaneously administered recombinant NRG1 in vivo. Consistent with the fast time course of bath NRG1 effects, 1-day monocular-deprived PV neurons show clear enhancement of excitatory input after 1 hr of in vivo NRG1 treatment (1 μg NRG1 per mouse, note the larger dose for this rapid acute effect in vivo) (Figure 3H). Exogenous in vivo NRG1 treatment (0.5 μg NRG1 per mouse, three injections daily) during the duration of monocular deprivation prevents deprivation-induced excitatory input reduction in PV neurons (Figure 3I). There are temporal limits to these effects: NRG1 injection in vivo restricted to the first 24 hr period after eyelid suture does not prevent 48 hr-deprivation-induced excitatory input reduction (data not shown). Consistent with the physiological changes evoked by monocular deprivation, the in vivo suppression of PV cell activity by DREADDs for 24 hr during the critical period causes a large reduction in local excitatory inputs (Figures 4A–4C). The DREADDs treatment inhibited PV neuronal activity for the same duration as provided by 1 day monocular deprivation. We then measured local excitatory inputs to DREADDs-inhibited PV neurons in cortical slices. As it is seen in PV neurons following brief monocular deprivation, bath NRG1 rapidly enhances excitatory synaptic inputs and direct glutamate evoked responses of DREADDs-inhibited PV cells (Figures 4D–4G). Together with the finding that reduced PV neuronal activity evoked by DREADDs leads to decreased NRG1 expression (Figures 2F and 2K), the DREADDs experiments complement our experiments with monocular deprivation and support our hypothesis that NRG1/ErbB4 signaling regulates excitatory inputs to physiologically inhibited PV neurons within the critical period. To confirm the specificity of the effects of NRG1 on PV cells, we mapped the connectivity strength and laminar distribution of presynaptic excitatory inputs onto L2/3 excitatory pyramidal neurons in binocular visual cortex. NRG1 treatment does not modulate excitatory circuit inputs to pyramidal cells in normal or deprived animals as revealed by photostimulation mapping (Figure 5). This is consistent with the finding that ErbB4 is not expressed in excitatory neurons in visual cortex (Figure S1) (also see references Fazzari et al., 2010Fazzari P. Paternain A.V. Valiente M.

Further, NRG1 treatment has no effect on intrinsic membrane excitability in pyramidal cells from normal or deprived animals (data not shown). In addition, the intracellular blocking experiments (see below, Figure 6) further localize NRG1 effects to PV cells. NRG1-induced enhancement of the deprived PV neuron response does not require NMDA receptor activation, as the co-application of NRG1 and an NMDA receptor antagonist, CPP (3-((R)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid) has no effect of suppressing NRG1-enhanced PV neuronal responses (Figures 6A, 6B, 6I, and 6J ). As fast excitatory synaptic currents are mediated by postsynaptic AMPA receptors in PV neurons, this result also suggests that downstream NRG1 signaling modulates AMPA receptors. The observed enhancement of PV excitatory inputs when NRG1 is administered is specific to direct NRG1 signaling at ErbB4 receptors on PV neurons. In the presence of an acutely applied ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478, no significant NRG1 effects are observed for deprived PV cells (Figures 6C, 6D, 6I, and 6J). In PV-Cre; ErbB4flx/flx mice in which ErbB4 is ablated specifically in PV-positive interneurons (Long et al., 2003Long W. Wagner K.U. Lloyd K.C. Binart N. Shillingford J.M. Hennighausen L. Jones F.E. Impaired differentiation and lactational failure of Erbb4-deficient mammary glands identify ERBB4 as an obligate mediator of STAT5.Development. 2003; 130: 5257-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), bath NRG1 has no effect on excitatory synaptic inputs to monocular-deprived PV neurons (Figures S7A–S7C). In addition, the PV cells with ErbB4 genetic ablation show reduced excitatory inputs compared with normal, non-ErbB4 knockout PV cells (Figures S7D and S7E). This result is in agreement with the previous finding that postsynaptic ErbB4 expression is important for the formation of excitatory synapses on hippocampal GABAergic interneurons (Fazzari et al., 2010Fazzari P. Paternain A.V. Valiente M. Pla R. Luján R. Lloyd K. Lerma J. Marín O. Rico B. Control of cortical GABA circuitry development by Nrg1 and ErbB4 signalling.Nature. 2010; 464: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Protein kinases are necessary for ocular dominance shifts during monocular deprivation (Berardi et al., 2003Berardi N. Pizzorusso T. Ratto G.M. Maffei L. Molecular basis of plasticity in the visual cortex.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether NRG1-enhanced AMPA receptor responses by downstream NRG1/ErbB4 signaling require protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent activation. Protein phosphorylation of AMPA receptors is known to modulate AMPA receptor conductance, and the membrane trafficking and redistribution of AMPA receptors to the postsynaptic membranes (Lu et al., 2001Lu W. Man H. Ju W. Trimble W.S. MacDonald J.F. Wang Y.T. Activation of synaptic NMDA receptors induces membrane insertion of new AMPA receptors and LTP in cultured hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 2001; 29: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Canonical NRG1/ErbB signaling pathways often involve ERK and PI3K/Akt; many studies show that PI3K is an upstream regulator of protein kinase C (PKC) (Bekhite et al., 2011Bekhite M.M. Finkensieper A. Binas S. Müller J. Wetzker R. Figulla H.R. Sauer H. Wartenberg M. VEGF-mediated PI3K class IA and PKC signaling in cardiomyogenesis and vasculogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells.J.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gamma signaling through protein kinase Czeta induces NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidant generation and NF-kappaB activation in endothelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16128-16138Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It is also known that the downstream signals linked to ErbB include the phospholipase C-dependent PKC pathway (Mei and Xiong, 2008Mei L. Xiong W.C. Neuregulin 1 in neural development, synaptic plasticity and schizophrenia.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 437-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). To specifically restrict the inhibition of PKC activation in recorded PV neurons, we included a pseudosubstrate non-membrane-permeable peptide inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC 19-36) in recording glass pipettes (Chen et al., 2000Chen C. Xu R. Clarke I.J. Ruan M. Loneragan K. Roh S.G. Diverse intracellular signalling systems used by growth hormone-releasing hormone in regulating voltage-gated Ca2+ or K channels in pituitary somatotropes.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and measured the response to bath-applied NRG1. Cellular inhibition of PKC through intracellular application of the PKC inhibitor blocks NRG1-induced responses (Figures 6E, 6F, 6I, and 6J). Therefore, PKC activation is essential for NRG1/ErbB4 enhancement of AMPA receptor responses. The timing of NRG1 potentiation of glutamate-evoked responses is consistent with the rapid insertion of the intracellular pool of AMPA receptors and increased clustering of AMPA receptors (Lu et al., 2001Lu W. Man H. Ju W. Trimble W.S. MacDonald J.F. Wang Y.T. Activation of synaptic NMDA receptors induces membrane insertion of new AMPA receptors and LTP in cultured hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 2001; 29: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar) at the membrane surface of PV neurons. To determine whether membrane-fusion-dependent exocytosis of internal AMPA receptors is required for the NRG1 effects on deprived PV neurons, we included botulinum toxin light chains (BTX) in the recording pipette (Li et al., 2005Li Q. Roberts A.C. Glanzman D.L. Synaptic facilitation and behavioral dishabituation in Aplysia: dependence on release of Ca2+ from postsynaptic intracellular stores, postsynaptic exocytosis, and modulation of postsynaptic AMPA receptor efficacy.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5623-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). BTX blocks the exocytosis of postsynaptic vesicles that contain new AMPA receptors, thus preventing membrane insertion. Using this approach, we determined whether BTX treatment blocks the effects of bath applied NRG1. In support of our hypothesis, intracellular application of BTX prevents the NRG1-induced enhancement of glutamate responses (Figures 6G–6J). Thus, NRG1 enhancement of PV neuron excitatory inputs requires insertion of additional AMPA receptors in PV neuron postsynaptic membrane surface. To investigate the possible requirement of protein synthesis in NRG1-enhanced PV neuronal responses, we incubated cortical slices in a protein synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin (Huber et al., 2000Huber K.M. Kayser M.S. Bear M.F. Role for rapid dendritic protein synthesis in hippocampal mGluR-dependent long-term depression.Science. 2000; 288: 1254-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), before bath NRG1 experiments. Compared to control experiments, blocking new protein synthesis by the anisomycin treatment does not appear to affect the potentiation of NRG1 on excitatory inputs to deprived PV neurons (data not shown). This result indicates that acute effects of bath-administrated NRG1 do not require new protein synthesis. Previous work showed that NRG1 increases evoked GABA release and modestly enhances inhibition onto excitatory neurons in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (Tamura et al., 2012Tamura H. Kawata M.

Such markers would be powerful tools for studying satellite cell function during homeostasis and in pathogenesis of diseases such as muscular dystrophies. In this study, we show that the tetraspanin KAI/CD82 is an excellent marker for prospectively isolating stem cells from human fetal and adult skeletal muscle. Human CD82<sup>+</sup> muscle cells robustly engraft into a mouse model of muscular dystrophy. shRNA knockdown of CD82 in myogenic cells reduces myoblast proliferation, suggesting it is functionally involved in muscle homeostasis. CD82 physically interacts with alpha7beta1 integrin (α7β1-ITG) and with α-sarcoglycan, a member of the Dystrophin-Associated Glycoprotein Complex (DAPC), both of which have been linked to muscular dystrophies. Consistently, CD82 expression is decreased in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. Together, these findings suggest that CD82 function may be important for muscle stem cell function in muscular disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2521176179,"We previously demonstrated that fermitin family member 1 (FERMT1) was significantly overexpressed in colon cancer (CC) and associated with poor metastasis-free survival. This study aimed to investigate the precise role of FERMT1 in CC metastasis and the mechanism by which FERMT1 is involved in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Correlations between FERMT1 and EMT markers (E-cadherin, Slug, N-cadherin and β-catenin) were examined via immunohistochemistry in a cohort of CC tissues and adjacent normal colon mucosae. A series of in vitro and in vivo assays were performed to elucidate the function of FERMT1 in CC metastasis and underlying mechanisms. The upregulated expression of FERMT1 in CC tissues correlated positively with that of Slug, N-cadherin and β-catenin, but correlated inversely with E-cadherin expression. Altered FERMT1 expression led to marked changes in the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT markers of CC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Investigations of underlying mechanisms found that FERMT1 interacted directly with β-catenin and activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by decreasing the phosphorylation level of β-catenin, enhancing β-catenin nuclear translocation and increasing the transcriptional activity of β-catenin/TCF/LEF. Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by CHIR99021 reversed the effect of FERMT1 knockdown, whereas inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by XAV939 impaired the effect of FERMT1 overexpression on EMT and cell motility. In conclusion, findings of this study suggest that FERMT1 activates the β-catenin transcriptional activity to promote EMT in CC metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2520395051,"Elevated plasma concentration of the pro-atherogenic oxidized low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) triggers adverse effects in pancreatic beta-cells and is associated with type 2 diabetes. Here, we investigated whether the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a key player coupling oxidative stress to beta-cell dysfunction and death elicited by human oxidized LDL. We found that human oxidized LDL activates ER stress as evidenced by the activation of the inositol requiring 1α, and the elevated expression of both DDIT3 (also called CHOP) and DNAJC3 (also called P58IPK) ER stress markers in isolated human islets and the mouse insulin secreting MIN6 cells. Silencing of Chop and inhibition of ER stress markers by the chemical chaperone phenyl butyric acid (PBA) prevented cell death caused by oxidized LDL. Finally, we found that oxidative stress accounts for activation of ER stress markers induced by oxidized LDL. Induction of Chop/CHOP and p58IPK/P58IPK by oxidized LDL was mimicked by hydrogen peroxide and was blocked by co-treatment with the N-acetylcystein antioxidant. As a conclusion, the harmful effects of oxidized LDL in beta-cells requires ER stress activation in a manner that involves oxidative stress. This mechanism may account for impaired beta-cell function in diabetes and can be reversed by antioxidant treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2519747269,"In the three-dimensional extracellular matrix of the insect cuticle, horizontally aligned microfibrils composed of the polysaccharide chitin and associated proteins are stacked either parallel to each other or helicoidally. The underlying molecular mechanisms that implement differential chitin organization are largely unknown. To learn more about cuticle organization, we sought to study the role of chitin deacetylases (CDA) in this process. In the body cuticle of nymphs of the migratory locust Locusta migratoria, helicoidal chitin organization is changed to an organization with unidirectional microfibril orientation when LmCDA2 expression is knocked down by RNA interference. In addition, the LmCDA2-deficient cuticle is less compact suggesting that LmCDA2 is needed for chitin packaging. Animals with reduced LmCDA2 activity die at molting, underlining that correct chitin organization is essential for survival. Interestingly, we find that LmCDA2 localizes only to the initially produced chitin microfibrils that constitute the apical site of the chitin stack. Based on our data, we hypothesize that LmCDA2-mediated chitin deacetylation at the beginning of chitin production is a decisive reaction that triggers helicoidal arrangement of subsequently assembled chitin-protein microfibrils."

A substantial variation of HCR1 in regulating Lpr is observed at the Arabidopsis species level. Thus, by combinatorially integrating two soil signals, K+ and O2 availability, HCR1 modulates the resilience of plants to multiple flooding scenarios. The growth and survival of land plants critically depend on efficient soil water uptake. To achieve this, higher plants have evolved highly specialized root systems. While their sustained growth and branching allow optimal soil exploration, water permeability of roots (in other words, root hydraulic conductivity, Lpr) favors the radial transfer of water from the soil into the root stele for subsequent transport to the shoot. Aquaporins, water channel proteins that facilitate water transport across root cell membranes (Maurel et al., 2015Maurel C. Boursiac Y. Luu D.-T. Santoni V. Shahzad Z. Verdoucq L. Aquaporins in plants.Physiol. Rev. 2015; 95: 1321-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), are main effectors of radial water transport. They mediate the adjustment of root hydraulics in response to plant hormones or multiple edaphic or climatic factors (Aroca et al., 2012Aroca R. Porcel R. Ruiz-Lozano J.M. Regulation of root water uptake under abiotic stress conditions.J. Exp. Bot. 2012; 63: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, Maurel et al., 2015Maurel C. Boursiac Y. Luu D.-T. Santoni V.

Rev. 2015; 95: 1321-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), thereby contributing to maintenance of the plant water status under changing environmental conditions. Although they represent a key point for adaptation of wild plant species to diverse natural habitats and a major target for crop improvement, the signaling mechanisms that link soil properties to root hydraulics and aquaporin functions remain largely unknown. The lack of proper direct genetic screens using plant hydraulics as a trait has restricted advances in this field. Oxygen (O2), which supports respiratory energy production, is, besides water, another critical factor for plant performance. Yet, its availability can be reduced by flooding or soil compaction. Eukaryotic organisms survive limited O2 availability (hypoxia) by reprograming gene expression and producing energy through ethanolic fermentation (Gibbs et al., 2015Gibbs D.J. Conde J.V. Berckhan S. Prasad G. Mendiondo G.M. Holdsworth M.J.

Dupuis I. Kuhlemeier C. Ethanolic fermentation: New functions for an old pathway.Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 320-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Primary activation of hypoxia signaling is achieved by Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) transcription factors (TFs) in animals and ethylene-responsive factor group VII (ERF-VII) TFs in plants. The model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana possesses five ERF-VII TFs named Related to AP (RAP) 2.2, RAP2.3, RAP2.12, Hypoxia Responsive ERF (HRE) 1, and HRE2 (Nakano et al., 2006Nakano T. Suzuki K. Fujimura T. Shinshi H. Genome-wide analysis of the ERF gene family in Arabidopsis and rice.Plant Physiol. 2006; 140: 411-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). Whereas HRE1 and HRE2 are regulated in an O2-dependent manner at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (Gibbs et al., 2011Gibbs D.J. Lee S.C. Isa N.M. Gramuglia S. Fukao T. Bassel G.W.

Oxygen sensing in plants is mediated by an N-end rule pathway for protein destabilization.Nature. 2011; 479: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Under non-limiting O2 concentrations (normoxia), Arabidopsis ERF-VII proteins including RAP2.12 are oxidized and degraded via an evolutionary conserved N-end rule pathway. Conversely, their stabilization under hypoxia triggers anaerobic gene expression. However, additional, largely unknown posttranslational mechanisms are thought to contribute to the regulation of ERF-VII TFs (Gibbs et al., 2015Gibbs D.J. Conde J.V. Berckhan S. Prasad G. Mendiondo G.M. Holdsworth M.J. Group VII Ethylene Response Factors co-ordinate oxygen and nitric oxide signal transduction and stress responses in plants.Plant Physiol. 2015; 169: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Early adaptive responses of plants to O2 deficiency also include adjustments of their water and nutritional status. For instance, hypoxia caused by flooding can lead to downregulation of Lpr, leaf dehydration, and stomatal closure (Aroca et al., 2012Aroca R. Porcel R. Ruiz-Lozano J.M. Regulation of root water uptake under abiotic stress conditions.J. Exp. Bot. 2012; 63: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, the early root hydraulic response to hypoxia is caused by pH-dependent gating of Plasma membrane Intrinsic Proteins (PIPs) aquaporins (Tournaire-Roux et al., 2003Tournaire-Roux C. Sutka M. Javot H. Gout E. Gerbeau P. Luu D.-T. Bligny R. Maurel C. Cytosolic pH regulates root water transport during anoxic stress through gating of aquaporins.Nature. 2003; 425: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Uptake and partitioning of macronutrients such as nitrogen, phosphate, or potassium (K+) is also inhibited in plants during hypoxia (Shabala et al., 2014Shabala S. Shabala L. Barcelo J. Poschenrieder C. Membrane transporters mediating root signalling and adaptive responses to oxygen deprivation and soil flooding.Plant Cell Environ. 2014; 37: 2216-2233PubMed Google Scholar, Wiengweera and Greenway, 2004Wiengweera A. Greenway H. Performance of seminal and nodal roots of wheat in stagnant solution: K+ and P uptake and effects of increasing O2 partial pressures around the shoot on nodal root elongation.J. Exp. Bot. 2004; 55: 2121-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), possibly due to reduced cell energy status. In addition, each of these macronutrients exerts contrasting effects on Lpr through regulation of aquaporins (Maurel et al., 2015Maurel C. Boursiac Y. Luu D.-T. Santoni V. Shahzad Z. Verdoucq L. Aquaporins in plants.Physiol. Rev. 2015; 95: 1321-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). However, it is not known how plant roots can handle multiple soil signals simultaneously. In particular, cross-talks of hypoxia with other abiotic stresses and the impact of such integrated signaling on plant adaptation to low-O2 have not been explored. To identify genetic factors relevant to the regulation of root water transport and plant adaptation to natural habitats, we explored the variation of Lpr in wild isolates (accessions) of Arabidopsis. Multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling Lpr were detected in a recombinant population obtained from a cross between two accessions. Positional cloning of Hydraulic Conductivity of Root 1 (HCR1), one of these Lpr QTL genes, revealed a Raf-like MAPKKK (Rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma-like mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase) that negatively regulates root water transport in response to both K+ and O2 availability. Furthermore, we show that HCR1 controls a general K+-dependent molecular pathway for hypoxia signaling in plants. Thus, HCR1 links root hydraulics and whole-genome transcriptional responses to two fundamental soil parameters. We propose that its natural variations underlie distinct plant strategies for plant growth under O2-limiting conditions. We previously showed that the Col-0 and Bur-0 accessions have distinct root hydraulic profiles, the latter showing a relatively low contribution of aquaporins to Lpr (Sutka et al., 2011Sutka M. Li G. Boudet J. Boursiac Y. Doumas P. Maurel C. Natural variation of root hydraulics in Arabidopsis grown in normal and salt-stressed conditions.Plant Physiol. 2011; 155: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Here, we used a set of 123 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) obtained from a cross between these accessions and performed QTL mapping for Lpr. The RILs were also phenotyped for plant growth, to check for possible pleiotropic effects on plant hydraulics. Although all investigated traits are highly sensitive to environment, standardized plant growth and hydraulic phenotyping procedures yielded broad-sense heritabilities (h2) ≥0.45 (Table S1). Three QTLs for Lpr named Lprm120, Lprt320, and Lprm320 were detected on chromosomes 1, 3, and 3, respectively (Figure 1A; Table S2). Lprm320 explains 15% of total phenotypic variance (Table S2), does not co-localize with growth related QTLs (Figure 1A), and was selected for further studies. Its effects were confirmed using Nearly Isogenic Lines (NILs) of Heterogeneous Inbred Family (HIF)-type fixed for either Bur-0 or Col-0 allele. HIF289, which is heterozygous for a >4.2-Mb region encompassing Lprm320, recapitulated the positive versus negative effects of Col-0 and Bur-0 alleles on Lpr, with a 19.2% ± 2% difference between genotypes (Figure 1B; Table S2). After treatment with mercuric chloride (50 μM HgCl2; 40 min) or sodium azide (1 mM NaN3; 30 min), two pharmacological agents inhibiting root aquaporins through independent modes of action (Sutka et al., 2011Sutka M. Li G. Boudet J. Boursiac Y. Doumas P. Maurel C. Natural variation of root hydraulics in Arabidopsis grown in normal and salt-stressed conditions.Plant Physiol. 2011; 155: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the alternative genotypes of HIF289 exhibited similar, strongly reduced Lpr, indicating that their distinct Lpr under standard conditions are due to differences in aquaporin activity (Figure 1B). To restrain the QTL region, fine mapping was performed using recombinant HIFs (rHIFs) generated by selfing HIF289 and selecting progeny lines with recombination break points at different intervals (Figure S1A). In total, 16 rHIFs were tested for segregation of Lpr. Extensive characterization of two genotypically close rHIFs (289-40 and 289-57) that showed differential segregation for Lpr helped restrain the QTL region to ∼15 kb.Figure S1Positional Cloning of HCR1, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Fine map of Lprm320 using recombinant heterogeneous inbred families (rHIFs).

(D) Comparison of Col-0 and hcr1 plants for Lpr, before and after treatment with HgCl2 or NaN3. The graph shows average Lpr (±SE) of each line from the indicated number of plants in two to four independent plant cultures. The candidate interval harbored five open reading frames (Figure S1A). Phenotyping of knockout mutant lines of each of these (Key Resources Table) revealed that only two independent mutants of At3g24715 exhibited altered Lpr (>15% increase) as compared to Col-0 (Figure S1B), while no alteration in root growth (dry weight) was observed (Figure S1C). Moreover, HgCl2 and NaN3 inhibition experiments indicated that the difference in Lpr between Col-0 and At3g24715 mutants can be accounted for by a difference in aquaporin activity (Figure S1D). Because of such consistent root water transport phenotypes in two independent allelic knockout mutants, At3g24715 was named Hydraulic Conductivity of Root 1 (HCR1). To confirm that HCR1 is the gene underlying Lprm320, we first performed a quantitative complementation of the Lpr phenotype of one of knockout mutants (hcr1-2) in a cross with advanced rHIFs bringing either a Bur-0 or a Col-0 allele. The latter conferred on hcr1-2 a higher Lpr than the former, whereas the two alleles had indistinguishable effects in a cross with Col-0 (Figure S2A). Such an interaction between the QTL allele and mutant background is a strong indication that variation at HCR1 is responsible for Lprm320. Further, molecular complementation of the other knockout mutant (hcr1-1) was performed by introduction of genomic Bur-0 and Col-0 alleles through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. HCR1 mRNA abundance was analyzed using qRT-PCR in independent transgenic lines to confirm the expression of transgenes (Figure S2B). The two alleles reduced the Lpr of hcr1-1, independent of their expression level, but with distinct amplitude (Col-0: −13.3% ± 3.0%; Bur-0: −22.0% ± 2.8%) consistent with the QTL effects (Figures 1C and S2C). The overall data establish that HCR1 underlies Lprm320 and acts as a negative regulator of Lpr. HCR1 belongs to the B4 group of Raf-like MAPKKKs (Ichimaru and MAPK group, 2002Ichimaru K. MAPK group Protein kinase cascades in plants: MAPK Group.Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) with seven uncharacterized members in Arabidopsis. HCR1 harbors in its N-terminal region a Phox/Bem1p (PB1) domain for putative protein-protein interaction, and in its C-terminal region a protein kinase domain sharing similarity with Raf kinases (Figure 1D). Following discovery of HCR1 based on genetic differences between two wild accessions, we further characterized its natural variations. A worldwide collection of 72 Arabidopsis accessions (Table S3) could be classified into seven haplogroups (H1–H7), according to polymorphisms in HCR1 predicted protein sequence (Figure 1D). All accessions were phenotyped for Lpr, with average values showing significant differences between some haplogroups. Notably, H3 and H4 exhibited higher Lpr than H1 and H2, which comprise Col-0 and Bur-0, respectively. We chose Fei-0 and Zu-1 as representative accessions for haplogroups H3 and H4, respectively, and introduced their corresponding HCR1 genomic regions into hcr1-1. These transformations led to proper expression of the two HCR1 allelic forms (Figure S2B) but did not alter hcr1-1 for Lpr (Figures 1C and S2C), indicating that they are inactive in a Col-0 background. Thus, natural HCR1 forms fall in at least three functional groups and contribute to Lpr variation at the species-wide level. The enzymatic activity of the C-terminal kinase domain of Col-0 HCR1 (HCR1821–1117) was investigated using a fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and production from an Escherichia coli expression system. The generic substrate Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) could be phosphorylated in vitro by the recombinant protein (Figures 1E and 1F). Regarding the functional significance of polymorphisms among HCR1 haplogroups, we found that, in contrast to its Col-0, Bur-0, and Zu-1 counterparts, a HCR1 fragment (HCR1801–1117) encompassing the protein kinase domain and prepared from Fei-0 could not phosphorylate MBP (Figure S2D). This defect is related to the specific Pro-to-Leu substitution at position 1072 in the protein kinase domain of the Fei-0 form. It is consistent with the inability of the Fei-0 allele to complement the hcr1-1 mutant in a Col-0 background. Because it is a reference accession in Arabidopsis studies, the parental line Col-0 was selected for further functional characterization of HCR1. Transgenic expression of a promHCR1::β-glucuronidase (GUS) chimeric gene indicated a preferential promoter activity in the root stele, consistent with a general role in root hydraulics (Figures 2A and 2B ). Reporter gene expression was not detectable in leaves and plant reproductive parts (Figures S3A–S3C). The Raf-like MAPKKK structure of HCR1 is suggestive of a signaling function. We therefore hypothesized a role for HCR1 in Lpr response to some of endogenous or environmental cues acting in roots and present in our standard growth conditions. To investigate these, Col-0 and hcr1 plants were comparatively phenotyped for Lpr using various hormonal or abiotic treatments (Table S4), the latter including osmotic (salt) stress, changes in irradiance or relative humidity, and deficiencies or sufficiencies for various nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, K+, sulfur, iron) or O2. None of seven treatments found to decrease Lpr altered the phenotypic difference between Col-0 and hcr1 (Figure S3D). Among the other conditions tested, K+ starvation led to an ∼20% increase of Lpr in Col-0, consequently phenocopying hcr1 Lpr phenotype, while the mutant remained insensitive to this treatment (Figure S3E). Treatment with cesium chloride, a blocker of K+ channels (Broadley et al., 2001Broadley M.R. Escobar-Gutiérrez A.J. Bowen H.C. Willey N.J. White P.J. Influx and accumulation of Cs+ by the akt1 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. lacking a dominant K+ transport system.J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), recapitulated the differential K+ starvation response of Col-0 and hcr1 (Figure S3E). Col-0 and hcr1 showed similar K+ content in roots (Figure S3F) indicating that hcr1 has a genuine defect in external K+ perception, thereby lacking negative effects of K+ on Lpr observed in Arabidopsis (Col-0) and other plant species (Wang et al., 2013Wang M. Zheng Q. Shen Q. Guo S. The critical role of potassium in plant stress response.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2013; 14: 7370-7390Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). We also found that bubbling air into the root bathing solution, similar to K+ starvation, increased Lpr in Col-0, to values similar to those in hcr1, while having no effects on the latter genotype (Figures 2C and S3E). Air bubbling was not used in standard conditions, to avoid root mechanical disturbance and thereby achieve homogeneous plant growth, a prerequisite for accurate Lpr QTL mapping. However, positive effects of air bubbling on Lpr suggested that our standard conditions were somewhat O2 deficient. This was corroborated by a partial pressure for O2, which was significantly lower than that in air bubbling conditions (standard: pO2 = 11.1% ± 1.1%; bubbling: pO2 = 20.1% ± 0.3%). By convention, the two growth conditions are now referred as hypoxia and normoxia, respectively. Interestingly, coupling of K+ starvation with normoxia did not result in additive effect on Lpr (Figure 2C). Thus, K+ and O2 act oppositely on Lpr through common signaling pathways involving HCR1.Figure S3Tissue Localization of HCR1 Putative Promoter Activity and Phenotypes of a hcr1 Knockout Mutant under Various Plant Growth Conditions, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A–C) promHCR1::GUS expression was not detected in young leaves (A), inflorescences (B), or siliques (C).

(F) Mean concentration (± SE) of indicated cations in the roots of Col-0 and hcr1 plants grown under standard conditions (n = 8, N = 4). To gain further insights into the molecular function of HCR1, a comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed using Col-0 and hcr1 plants grown under conditions where HCR1 acts on Lpr i.e. K+-replete hypoxia. Genome-wide expression analysis based on gene chip hybridization uncovered deregulation of 112 genes in hcr1 mutants as compared to Col-0 (>1.5-fold change at p < 0.05 in at least one hcr1 allele) (Figure 3A; Table S5). These results were validated for a few selected genes using qRT-PCR (Figure S4). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that genes deregulated in hcr1 had significant enrichment in biological processes related to O2 levels (Table S6). Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that all of the genes related to GO term “oxygen” belonged to cluster 1, the most strongly downregulated mRNAs in hcr1 as compared to Col-0 (Figure 3A). This prompted us to compare the deregulated transcriptome of hcr1 to three transcriptomic datasets in Arabidopsis roots under hypoxia (Branco-Price et al., 2008Branco-Price C. Kaiser K.A. Jang C.J.H.

Interestingly, 44 (39%) and 21 (19%) of the 112 genes that are deregulated in hcr1 were responsive to hypoxia in at least one or all three studies, respectively. We next used qRT-PCR and investigated a core set of six typical hypoxia-responsive genes (HRGs) encoding TFs HRE1 and HRE2, sucrose synthetases (SUS1 and SUS4), and fermentative enzymes [alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1), pyruvate decarboxylase 1 (PDC1)] (Figures 3C and S4, upper panel). All showed a consistent downregulation in the two hcr1 alleles. Thus, hcr1 plants show a reduced molecular response to hypoxia indicating that HCR1 positively regulates the core anaerobic transcriptional response. Since Lpr of Col-0 is downregulated in response to O2 deficiency (Figure 2C), the enhanced Lpr of hcr1 with respect to Col-0 can also be interpreted as a reduced sensitivity to this stress. Surprisingly, the gene chip analysis did not reveal any deregulation in hcr1 of genes related to K+ homeostasis. To further investigate root response to K+, we used qRT-PCR and searched for a possible interplay between K+ and O2 availabilities during transcriptional response of typical HRGs. As shown in Figure 3C, HRE1, HRE2, and ADH1 were strongly induced by hypoxia, and 30%–60% of this induction was dependent upon the presence of K+ in the medium. With respect to Col-0, the latter component was lacking in hcr1 as the two genotypes showed similar transcriptional response under combined O2 and K+ deficiencies. Thus, hcr1 shows a transcriptional phenotype exclusively under K+-replete and O2-deficient conditions, thereby offering a striking parallel to its Lpr phenotype. These results uncover a link between K+ and O2 sensing in plants, which is fully dependent on HCR1.Figure S4mRNA Abundance of Representative Hypoxia-Responsive Genes in hcr1, Related to Figure 3Show full captionMicroarray experiments showed the indicated genes to be de-regulated in hcr1.

https://openalex.org/W2521892214,"Reprogrammed metabolism is one of the hallmarks of cancer. The dysregulation of glycolysis in cancer has been heavily studied. However, it remains largely unclear how other metabolic processes are regulated in cancer cells. Here we show that microRNA-182 (miR-182) suppresses pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase 4 (PDK4) and promotes lung tumorigenesis. miR-182 is dysregulated and inversely correlated with PDK4 in human lung adenocarcinomas. The miR-182-PDK4 axis regulates lung cancer cell growth by modulating the activity of PDH, the gatekeeping enzyme of pyruvate flux into acetyl-CoA, and subsequently de novo lipogenesis of cancer cells. Suppression of lipogenesis by silencing ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) or by chemical inhibitors diminishes the effects of miR-182-PDK4 in tumor growth. Alteration of de novo lipogenesis also affects reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the downstream JNK signaling pathway. Hence, our work suggests that the miR-182-PDK4 axis is a crucial regulator of cancer cell metabolism and a potential target for antitumor therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2520734749,"Most bacteria alternate between a free living planktonic lifestyle and the formation of structured surface-associated communities named biofilms. The transition between these two lifestyles requires a precise and timely regulation of the factors involved in each of the stages that has been likened to a developmental process. Here we characterize the involvement of the transcriptional regulator FleQ and the second messenger cyclic diguanylate in the coordinate regulation of multiple functions related to motility and surface colonization in Pseudomonas putida. Disruption of fleQ caused strong defects in flagellar motility, biofilm formation and surface attachment, and the ability of this mutation to suppress multiple biofilm-related phenotypes associated to cyclic diguanylate overproduction suggests that FleQ mediates cyclic diguanylate signaling critical to biofilm growth. We have constructed a library containing 94 promoters potentially involved in motility and biofilm development fused to gfp and lacZ, screened this library for FleQ and cyclic diguanylate regulation, and assessed the involvement of alternative σ factors σN and FliA in the transcription of FleQ-regulated promoters. Our results suggest a dual mode of action for FleQ. Low cyclic diguanylate levels favor FleQ interaction with σN-dependent promoters to activate the flagellar cascade, encompassing the flagellar cluster and additional genes involved in cyclic diguanylate metabolism, signal transduction and gene regulation. On the other hand, characterization of the FleQ-regulated σN- and FliA-independent PlapA and PbcsD promoters revealed two disparate regulatory mechanisms leading to a similar outcome: the synthesis of biofilm matrix components in response to increased cyclic diguanylate levels."
https://openalex.org/W2519480017,"Background Weak grip strength (GS) is a key component of sarcopenia and frailty and a powerful predictor of mortality, morbidity and disability. Despite increasing interest in understanding GS across the lifespan, little is known about GS decline in the very old (aged ≥85). We examined trajectories of GS in very old adults and identified the determinants. Methods GS (kg) was measured four times over 5 years in 319 men and 526 women participating in the Newcastle 85+ Study. A weak GS sub-cohort was identified as having strength of ≤27 kg (men), and ≤16 kg (women) at baseline and follow-up. Mixed models were used to establish trajectories of GS and associated factors in all participants, men and women, and in those with weak GS. Results Men’s mean grip strength was 24.42 (SD = 6.77) kg, and women’s 13.23 (4.42) kg (p<0.001) at baseline, with mean absolute change of -5.27 (4.90) kg and -3.14 (3.41), respectively (p<0.001) by 5-year follow-up. In the time-only mixed model, men experienced linear annual decline in GS of -1.13 (0.8) kg (β (SE), p<0.001), whilst women’s decline although slower, accelerated by -0.06 (0.02) kg (p = 0.01) over time. In the saturated model, higher baseline physical activity, height, fat-free mass, better self-rated health, and not having arthritis in hand(s) were associated with stronger GS initially in both sexes. Annual GS decline in men and participants with weak GS who were highly physically active was slower by 0.95 and 0.52 kg, respectively compared with inactive counterparts. Conclusion Grip strength decline in the very old followed linear (men) and curvilinear (women) trends. High levels of physical activity were protective of GS loss in men (but not in women) and in those with weak GS. Thus maintaining muscle strength in later life is important to reduce the morbidity and mortality in the very old."
https://openalex.org/W2521652730,"Long-term survival remains low for most patients with glioblastoma (GBM), which reveals the need for markers of disease outcome and novel therapeutic targets. We describe that ODZ1 (also known as TENM1), a type II transmembrane protein involved in fetal brain development, plays a crucial role in the invasion of GBM cells. Differentiation of glioblastoma stem-like cells drives the nuclear translocation of an intracellular fragment of ODZ1 through proteolytic cleavage by signal peptide peptidase-like 2a. The intracellular fragment of ODZ1 promotes cytoskeletal remodelling of GBM cells and invasion of the surrounding environment both in vitro and in vivo. Absence of ODZ1 by gene deletion or downregulation of ODZ1 by small interfering RNAs drastically reduces the invasive capacity of GBM cells. This activity is mediated by an ODZ1-triggered transcriptional pathway, through the E-box binding Myc protein, that promotes the expression and activation of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and subsequent activation of Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK). Overexpression of ODZ1 in GBM cells reduced survival of xenografted mice. Consistently, analysis of 122 GBM tumour samples revealed that the number of ODZ1-positive cells inversely correlated with overall and progression-free survival. Our findings establish a novel marker of invading GBM cells and consequently a potential marker of disease progression and a therapeutic target in GBM."

Here, we report that the d16HER2-positive mammary tumor cell lines MI6 and MI7, derived from spontaneous lesions of d16HER2 transgenic (tg) mice and resembling the aggressive features of primary lesions, are enriched in the expression of Wnt, Notch and epithelial–mesenchymal transition pathways related genes compared with full-length wild-type (WT) HER2-positive cells (WTHER2_1 and WTHER2_2) derived from spontaneous tumors arising in WTHER2 tg mice. MI6 cells exhibited increased resistance to anoikis and significantly higher mammosphere-forming efficiency (MFE) and self-renewal capability than the WTHER2-positive counterpart. Furthermore, d16HER2-positive tumor cells expressed a higher fraction of CD29High/CD24+/SCA1Low cells and displayed greater in vivo tumor engraftment in serial dilution conditions than WTHER2_1 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2523329479,"Environmental drug resistance constitutes a serious impediment for therapeutic intervention in multiple myeloma. Tumor-promoting cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), induce nuclear factor-κB (NFκB)- driven expression of pro-survival factors, which confer resistance in myeloma cells to apoptotic insults from TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and other chemotherapeutic drugs. It is thought that RelA:p50 dimer, activated from IκBα-inhibited complex in response to TNF-induced canonical NFκB signal, mediates the pro-survival NFκB function in cancerous cells. Myeloma cells additionally acquire gain-of-function mutations in the non-canonical NFκB module, which induces partial proteolysis of p100 into p52 to promote RelB:p52/NFκB activation from p100-inhibited complex during immune cell differentiation. However, role of non-canonical NFκB signaling in the drug resistance in multiple myeloma remains unclear. Here we report that myeloma-associated non-canonical aberrations reinforce pro-survival TNF signaling in producing a protracted TRAIL-refractory state. These mutations did not act through a typical p52 NFκB complex, but completely degraded p100 to reposition RelB under IκBα control, whose degradation during TNF signaling induced an early RelB:p50 containing NFκB activity. More so, autoregulatory RelB synthesis prolonged this TNF-induced RelB:p50 activity in myeloma cells harboring non-canonical mutations. Intriguingly, TNF-activated RelB:p50 dimer was both necessary and sufficient, and RelA was not required, for NFκB-dependent pro-survival gene expressions and suppression of apoptosis. Indeed, high RelB mRNA expressions in myeloma patients correlated with the augmented level of pro-survival factors and resistance to therapeutic intervention. In sum, we provide evidence that cancer-associated mutations perpetuate TNF-induced pro-survival NFκB activity through autoregulatory RelB control and thereby exacerbate environmental drug resistance in multiple myeloma."

Contrarily, bubbling the aquarium water with CO2 can be considered a ""partially successful"" anesthesia, because signal propagation is inhibited but before that the animals show discomfort. The procedure of ""electro-stunning"" induces epileptic-form seizures in the crustacean CNS (lobster, crayfish), which overlay but do not mitigate the response to external stimuli. After several minutes the activity declines before the nervous system starts to recover. A feasible way to sacrifice lobsters is to slowly raise the water temperature (1°C min-1), as all electrical activities in the CNS cease at temperatures above ~30°C, whereas below this temperature the animals do not show signs of stress or escape behavior (e.g. tail flips) in the warming water.CO2 is efficient to anaesthetize lobster and crayfish but due to low pH in water is stressful to the animals previous to anesthesia. Electrical stunning induces epileptiform seizures but paralyses the animals and leads to a reversible decline of nerve system activity after seizure.

https://openalex.org/W2522471034,"Epigenetic regulators are attractive targets for the development of new cancer therapies. Among them, the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes control the chromatin architecture and have important roles in gene regulation. They are often found to be mutated and de-regulated in cancers, but how they influence the cancer gene expression program during cancer initiation and progression is not fully understood. Here we show that the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex is required for oncogenic transcription and tumor growth in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Ino80, the SWI/SNF ATPase in the complex, is highly expressed in NSCLC cells compared with normal lung epithelia cells. Further, its expression, as well as that of another subunit Ino80B, negatively correlates with disease prognosis in lung cancer patients. Functionally, INO80 silencing inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumor formation in mouse xenografts. It occupies enhancer regions near lung cancer-associated genes, and its occupancy correlates with increased genome accessibility and enhanced expression of downstream genes. Together, our study defines a critical role of INO80 in promoting oncogenic transcription and NSCLC tumorigenesis, and reveals a potential treatment strategy for inhibiting the cancer transcription network by targeting the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex."

To explore p53 structural dynamics, here we developed a series of atomistic integrative models with available crystal structures of the full-length p53 (fl-p53) tetramer bound to three different DNA sequences: a p21 response element, a puma response element and a nonspecific DNA sequence. Explicitly solvated, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the three complexes (totaling nearly 1 μs of aggregate simulation time) yield final structures consistent with electron microscopy maps and, for the first time, show the direct interactions of the p53 C-terminal with DNA. Through a collective principal component analysis, we identify sequence-dependent differential quaternary binding modes of the p53 tetramer interfacing with DNA. Additionally, L1 loop dynamics of fl-p53 in the presence of DNA is revealed, and druggable pockets of p53 are identified via solvent mapping to aid future drug discovery studies."
https://openalex.org/W2523076667,"Restoration of tumor suppression is an attractive onco-therapeutic approach. It is particularly relevant when a tumor suppressor is excessively degraded by an overactive oncogenic E3 ligase. We previously discovered that the E6-associated protein (E6AP; as classified in the human papilloma virus context) is an E3 ligase that has an important role in the cellular stress response, and it directly targets the tumor-suppressor promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) for proteasomal degradation. In this study, we have examined the role of the E6AP–PML axis in prostate cancer (PC). We show that knockdown (KD) of E6AP expression attenuates growth of PC cell lines in vitro. We validated this finding in vivo using cell line xenografts, patient-derived xenografts and mouse genetics. We found that KD of E6AP attenuates cancer cell growth by promoting cellular senescence in vivo, which correlates with restoration of tumor suppression by PML. In addition, we show that KD of E6AP sensitizes cells to radiation-induced death. Overall, our findings demonstrate a role for E6AP in the promotion of PC and support E6AP targeting as a novel approach for PC treatment, either alone or in combination with radiation."

In this study, we report the isolation of bacteria resistant to the third-generation cephalosporin cefotaxime from cattle with no previous cefotaxime antibiotic exposure. The prevalence of cefotaxime-resistant bacteria was examined by a combination of culture based and molecular typing methods in beef cattle (n = 1341) from 8 herds located in North Central Florida. The overall prevalence of cefotaxime-resistant bacteria was 15.8% (95% CI: 13.9, 17.8), varied between farms, and ranged from 5.2% to 100%. A subset of isolates (n = 23) was further characterized for the cefotaxime minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and antibiotic susceptibility against 10 different antibiotics, sequencing of nine β- lactamase genes, and species identification by 16S rRNA sequencing. Most of the bacterial isolates were resistant to cefotaxime (concentrations, > 64 μg/mL) and showed high levels of multi-drug resistance. Full length 16S rRNA sequences (~1300 bp) revealed that most of the isolates were not primary human or animal pathogens; rather were more typical of commensal, soil, or other environmental origin. Six extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes identical to those in clinical human isolates were identified. Our study highlights the potential for carriage of cefotaxime resistance (including “human” ESBL genes) by the bacterial flora of food animals with no history of cefotaxime antibiotic exposure. A better understanding of the origin and transmission of resistance genes in these pre-harvest settings will be critical to development of strategies to prevent the spread of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms to hospitals and communities."
https://openalex.org/W2519311038,"To evaluate the performance and treatment profile of advanced EML4-ALK positive Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in a developing country with potentially restricted access to Crizotinib.A retrospective analysis of advanced ALK positive NSCLC patients who were treated from June 2012 to September 2015 was conducted. The primary goal was to evaluate outcomes of advanced ALK positive NSCLC in our practice and examine the logistic constraints in procuring Crizotinib.94 patients were available for analysis. 21 (22.3%) patients were started on Crizotinib upfront, 60 (63.8%) on chemotherapy, 10 (10.6%) on Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (in view of poor PS) and 3 (3.2%) patients were offered best supportive care. Reasons for not starting Crizotinib upfront included symptomatic patients needing early initiation of therapy (23.3%), ALK not tested upfront (23.3%) and financial constraints (21.9%). 69 patients (73.4%) received Crizotinib at some stage during treatment. Dose interruptions (> 1 week) with Crizotinib were seen in 20 patients (29%), with drug toxicity being the commonest reason (85%). Median Progression free survival (PFS) on first line therapy for the entire cohort was 10 months, with a significant difference between patients receiving Crizotinib and those who did not ever receive Crizotinib (10 months vs. 2 months, p = 0.028). Median Overall Survival (OS) was not reached for the entire cohort, with 1 year survival being 81.2%. Patients with an ECOG Performance Status (PS) of >2 had a significantly reduced PFS compared to patients with PS < = 2 (1.5 months vs. 11 months, p< 0.001). 47 patients with financial constraints (68.1%) received Crizotinib completely free via various extramural support schemes.A majority of our ALK positive NSCLC patients were exposed to Crizotinib through the help of various support mechanisms and these patients had similar outcomes to that reported from previously published literature."
https://openalex.org/W2519071938,"It has been argued that the alcohol industry uses corporate social responsibility activities to influence policy and undermine public health, and that every opportunity should be taken to scrutinise such activities. This study analyses a controversial Diageo-funded 'responsible drinking' campaign (""Stop out of Control Drinking"", or SOOCD) in Ireland. The study aims to identify how the campaign and its advisory board members frame and define (i) alcohol-related harms, and their causes, and (ii) possible solutions.Documentary analysis of SOOCD campaign material. This includes newspaper articles (n = 9), media interviews (n = 11), Facebook posts (n = 92), and Tweets (n = 340) produced by the campaign and by board members. All material was coded inductively, and a thematic analysis undertaken, with codes aggregated into sub-themes.The SOOCD campaign utilises vague or self-defined concepts of 'out of control' and 'moderate' drinking, tending to present alcohol problems as behavioural rather than health issues. These are also unquantified with respect to actual drinking levels. It emphasises alcohol-related antisocial behaviour among young people, particularly young women. In discussing solutions to alcohol-related problems, it focuses on public opinion rather than on scientific evidence, and on educational approaches and information provision, misrepresenting these as effective. ""Moderate drinking"" is presented as a behavioural issue (""negative drinking behaviours""), rather than as a health issue.The 'Stop Out of Control Drinking' campaign frames alcohol problems and solutions in ways unfavourable to public health, and closely reflects other Diageo Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activity, as well as alcohol and tobacco industry strategies more generally. This framing, and in particular the framing of alcohol harms as a behavioural issue, with the implication that consumption should be guided only by self-defined limits, may not have been recognised by all board members. It suggests a need for awareness-raising efforts among the public, third sector and policymakers about alcohol industry strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2520932348,"The approximate number system (ANS) was proposed to be a building block for later mathematical abilities. Several measures have been used interchangeably to assess ANS acuity. Some of these measures were based on accuracy data, whereas others relied on response time (RT) data or combined accuracy and RT data. Previous studies challenged the view that all these measures can be used interchangeably, because low correlations between some of the measures had been observed. These low correlations might be due to poor reliability of some of the measures, since the majority of these measures are mathematically related. Here we systematically investigated the relationship between common ANS measures while avoiding the potential confound of poor reliability. Our first experiment revealed high correlations between all accuracy based measures supporting the assumption that all of them can be used interchangeably. In contrast, not all RT based measures were highly correlated. Additionally, our results revealed a speed-accuracy trade-off. Thus, accuracy and RT based measures provided conflicting conclusions regarding ANS acuity. Therefore, we investigated in two further experiments which type of measure (accuracy or RT) is more informative about the underlying ANS acuity, depending on participants' preferences for accuracy or speed. To this end, we manipulated participants' preferences for accuracy or speed both explicitly using different task instructions and implicitly varying presentation duration. Accuracy based measures were more informative about the underlying ANS acuity than RT based measures. Moreover, the influence of the underlying representations on accuracy data was more pronounced when participants preferred accuracy over speed after the accuracy instruction as well as for long or unlimited presentation durations. Implications regarding the diffusion model as a theoretical framework of dot comparison as well as regarding the relationship between ANS acuity and math performance are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2519651264,"In plants, several cellular and metabolic pathways interact with each other to regulate processes that are vital for their growth and development. Carbon (C) and Nitrogen (N) are two main nutrients for plants and coordination of C and N pathways is an important factor for maintaining plant growth and development. In the present work, influence of nitrogen and sucrose (C source) on growth parameters and expression of genes involved in nitrogen transport and assimilatory pathways was studied in B. juncea seedlings. For this, B. juncea seedlings were treated with four combinations of C and N source viz., N source alone (-Suc+N), C source alone (+Suc-N), with N and C source (+Suc+N) or without N and C source (-Suc-N). Cotyledon size and shoot length were found to be increased in seedlings, when nitrogen alone was present in the medium. Distinct expression pattern of genes in both, root and shoot tissues was observed in response to exogenously supplied N and C. The presence or depletion of nitrogen alone in the medium leads to severe up- or down-regulation of key genes involved in N-uptake and transport (BjNRT1.1, BjNRT1.8) in root tissue and genes involved in nitrate reduction (BjNR1 and BjNR2) in shoot tissue. Moreover, expression of several genes, like BjAMT1.2, BjAMT2 and BjPK in root and two genes BjAMT2 and BjGS1.1 in shoot were found to be regulated only when C source was present in the medium. Majority of genes were found to respond in root and shoot tissues, when both C and N source were present in the medium, thus reflecting their importance as a signal in regulating expression of genes involved in N-uptake and assimilation. The present work provides insight into the regulation of genes of N-uptake and assimilatory pathway in B. juncea by interaction of both carbon and nitrogen."

In this study, we revealed a molecular mechanism by which a stress-inducible, liver-enriched transcription factor, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein hepatic-specific (CREBH), modulates lipid profiles to protect the liver from injuries upon the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS challenge can activate CREBH in mouse liver tissues in a toll-like receptor (TLR)/MyD88-dependent manner. Upon LPS challenge, CREBH interacts with TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that functions as a key mediator of TLR signaling, and this interaction relies on MyD88. Further analysis demonstrated that TRAF6 mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of CREBH to facilitate CREBH cleavage and activation. CREBH directly activates expression of the gene encoding Apolipoprotein A4 (ApoA4) under LPS challenge, leading to modulation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in animals. CREBH deficiency led to reduced production of circulating HDL and increased liver damage upon high-dose LPS challenge.

Here, we show that PRG-2, a phospholipid-interacting molecule, is important for thalamocortical axon guidance. Developing thalamocortical fibers both in PRG-2 full knockout (KO) and in thalamus-specific KO mice prematurely entered the cortical plate, eventually innervating non-corresponding barrels. This misrouting relied on lost axonal sensitivity toward lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which failed to repel PRG-2-deficient thalamocortical fibers. PRG-2 electroporation in the PRG-2−/− thalamus restored the aberrant cortical innervation. We identified radixin as a PRG-2 interaction partner and showed that radixin accumulation in growth cones and its LPA-dependent phosphorylation depend on its binding to specific regions within the C-terminal region of PRG-2. In vivo recordings and whisker-specific behavioral tests demonstrated sensory discrimination deficits in PRG-2−/− animals. Our data show that bioactive phospholipids and PRG-2 are critical for guiding thalamic axons to their proper cortical targets."

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of storage period on the level of odorous compounds in pig slurry and on its bacterial community. A slurry sample (15 L) was taken from the pit of a finisher pig building and incubated in acryl chambers for six- weeks. Slurry for analysis was sampled every two-week. Levels of odorous compounds in the slurry sample were drastically changed after two weeks of storage period; levels of phenols and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were decreased (P<0.05), whereas indoles and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) were increased (P<0.05). Among dominant bacteria, Bacteroides and Porphyromonadacese_uc_g revealed a strong positive correlation with the levels of phenols and SCFAs. Populations of AC160630_g, Acholeplasmatales_uc_g, Mollicutes_uc_g and Cloacamonas_f_uc_g positively correlated with indole and BCFAs content. Taken together, levels of odorous compounds were increased after two weeks of storage, possibly because of changes in the predominant bacterial groups to those that use protein as a carbon source in the hypo-carbohydrate conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2519106847,"Background Tissue Angiotensin II (Ang-II), produced through local non ACE-dependent pathways, stimulates liver fibrogenesis, renal vasoconstriction and sodium retention. Aim To highlight chymase-dependent pathway of Ang-II production in liver and kidney during cirrhosis development. Methods Liver histology, portal pressure, liver and kidney function, and hormonal status were investigated in rat liver cirrhosis induced through 13 weeks of CCl4, with or without chymase inhibitor SF2809E, administered between 4th and 13th CCl4 weeks; liver and kidney chymase immunolocation and Ang-II content were assessed. Chymase immunohistochemistry was also assessed in normal and cirrhotic human liver, and chymase mRNA transcripts were measured in human HepG2 cells and activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC/MFs) in vitro. Results Rats receiving both CCl4 and SF2809E showed liver fibrotic septa focally linking portal tracts but no cirrhosis, as compared to ascitic cirrhotic rats receiving CCl4. SF2809E reduced portal pressure, plasma bilirubin, tissue content of Ang-II, plasma renin activity, norepinephrine and vasopressin, and increased glomerular filtration rate, water clearance, urinary sodium excretion. Chymase tissue content was increased and detected in α-SMA-positive liver myofibroblasts and in kidney tubular cells of cirrhotic rats. In human cirrhosis, chymase was located in hepatocytes of regenerative nodules. Human HepG2 cells and HSC/MFs responded to TGF-β1 by up-regulating chymase mRNA transcription. Conclusions Chymase, through synthesis of Ang-II and other mediators, plays a role in the derangement of liver and kidney function in chronic liver diseases. In human cirrhosis, chymase is well-represented and apt to become a future target of pharmacological treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2522558972,"Enzymes have evolved with highly specific values of their catalytic parameters kcat and KM. This poses fundamental biological questions about the selection pressures responsible for evolutionary tuning of these parameters. Here we are address these questions for the enzyme adenylate kinase (Adk) in eukaryotic yeast cells. A plasmid shuffling system was developed to allow quantification of relative fitness (calculated from growth rates) of yeast in response to perturbations of Adk activity introduced through mutations. Biophysical characterization verified that all variants studied were properly folded and that the mutations did not cause any substantial differences to thermal stability. We found that cytosolic Adk is essential for yeast viability in our strain background and that viability could not be restored with a catalytically dead, although properly folded Adk variant. There exist a massive overcapacity of Adk catalytic activity and only 12% of the wild type kcat is required for optimal growth at the stress condition 20°C. In summary, the approach developed here has provided new insights into the evolutionary tuning of kcat for Adk in a eukaryotic organism. The developed methodology may also become useful for uncovering new aspects of active site dynamics and also in enzyme design since a large library of enzyme variants can be screened rapidly by identifying viable colonies."
https://openalex.org/W2520630135,"Storage proteins are the major protein synthesized in the fat body, released into hemolymph and re-sequestered into the fat body before pupation in most insect species. Storage proteins are important amino acid and nutrition resources during the non-feeding pupal period and play essential roles for the metamorphosis and oogenesis of insects. The sequestration of storage protein is a selective, specific receptor-mediated process. However, to date, the potential receptor mediating the sequestration of storage protein has not been determined in Bombyx mori. In this study, we expressed and purified the first ligand binding domain of Bombyx mori vitellogenin receptor (BmVgR), LBD1, and found LBD1 could bind with an unknown protein from the hemolymph of the ultimate silkworm larval instar via pull-down assay. This unknown protein was subsequently identified to be the female-specific storage protein SP1 by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, far western blotting assay, immunoprecipitation and isothermal titration calorimetry analysis demonstrated LBD1 specifically bound with the female-specific SP1, rather than another unisex storage protein SP2. The specific binding of LBD1 with SP1 was dependent on the presence of Ca2+ as it was essential for the proper conformation of LBD1. Deletion mutagenesis and ITC analysis revealed the first and third ligand binding repeats LBR1 and LBR3 were indispensable for the binding of LBD1 with SP1, and LBR2 and LBR4 also had a certain contribution to the specific binding. Our results implied BmVgR may mediate the sequestration of SP1 from hemolymph into the fat body during the larval-pupal transformation of Bombyx mori."

In this study, the function of Ape1/Ref-1 in Th cell activation was analyzed using an Ape1/Ref-1 redox-specific inhibitor, E3330. When splenocytes from OT-II mice, which are ovalbumin (OVA)-specific T-cell receptor transgenic mice, were activated with OVA in the presence of E3330, the induction of IFN-γ-producing OT-II T cells was significantly increased. In contrast, E3330 did not enhance IFN-γ production from plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody-stimulated CD4+ T cells in the absence of antigen presenting cells (APCs). Furthermore, E3330-pretreated and OVA-pulsed APCs also enhanced the IFN-γ production from OT-II T cells. These results suggested that E3330 enhances Th1 responses by modifying APC function.

E3330 binds Ape1/Ref-1 directly to inhibit its redox activity (11.Kelley M.R. Luo M. Reed A. Su D. Delaplane S. Borch R.F. Nyland 2nd, R.L. Gross M.L. Georgiadis M.M. Functional analysis of novel analogues of E3330 that block the redox signaling activity of the multifunctional AP endonuclease/redox signaling enzyme APE1/Ref-1.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 1387-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but does not impede its DNA repair function (12.Zou G.M. Luo M.H. Reed A. Kelley M.R. Yoder M.C. Ape1 regulates hematopoietic differentiation of embryonic stem cells through its redox functional domain.Blood. 2007; 109: 1917-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We found that E3330 significantly increased the differentiation of IFN-γ-producing antigen-specific Th1 cells by up-regulating the IL-12 gene expression and IL-12 cell surface retention, but not the IL-12 secretion from bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs). These results were confirmed using Ape1/Ref-1 knock-down BMDCs. Taken together, these findings indicated that the redox function of Ape1/Ref-1 down-regulates Th1 responses through APCs. The mechanism by which the redox activity of Ape1/Ref-1 modulates IL-12 gene activation and cell surface retention is also discussed. To determine the role of the redox function of Ape1/Ref-1 in naïve helper T cell activation and differentiation, splenocytes from OT-II mice were stimulated with OVA and/or Pam3 CSK4 (Pam3) for 3 days in the presence or absence of E3330, and then analyzed by intracellular IFN-γ staining and flow cytometry. Notably, E3330 significantly increased the induction of IFN-γ-producing OT-II T cells upon OVA, or OVA and Pam3 stimulation (Fig. 1, A and B). Secreted IFN-γ in the culture medium, determined by cytometric bead array (CBA) analysis, was also up-regulated in E3330-treated splenocytes stimulated with OVA or OVA/Pam3 (data not shown). These results suggested that the redox function of Ape1/Ref-1 suppresses Th1 immune responses. The above findings prompted us to investigate whether E3330 acts directly on T cells. To address this question, we used anti-CD3 antibodies to stimulate CD4+ T cells in the absence of APCs. Purified CD4+ T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 antibodies and soluble anti-CD28 antibodies, and then cultured in the presence or absence of E3330. E3330 had no significant effect on the induction of IFN-γ-producing T cells in the absence of APCs (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that E3330 may affect APCs, but not T cells, during Th1 cell differentiation. To test the hypothesis that E3330 modulates OT-II T cell differentiation through effects on APCs, splenic DCs or BMDCs were pretreated with E3330 and pulsed with OVA or OVA-(323–339) peptide, respectively. The E3330 was then washed away, and the pretreated DCs were co-cultured with the OT-II T cells. The E3330-pretreated OVA- or OVA peptide-pulsed DCs induced more IFN-γ-producing CD4+ OT-II T cells than did the control OVA or OVA peptide-pulsed DCs (Fig. 3, A and B). These results further suggested that E3330 enhances Th1 responses by altering APC function. Next, we explored the mechanism by which E3330 modulated the APC function. In addition to the MHC-II-presented antigenic peptide, the B7 co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 expressed on APCs provide indispensable activation signals to naïve CD4+ T cells (13.Lenschow D.J. Walunas T.L. Bluestone J.A. CD28/B7 system of T cell costimulation.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). The treatment of BMDCs with E3330 alone had no significant effect on the cell surface expression of these molecules (Fig. 4). Although the TLR ligand LPS or Pam3 clearly up-regulated the expression of CD80 and CD86, and up-regulated MHC-II to a lesser extent, the addition of E3330 had no further effect on the expression of these molecules (Fig. 4). Next, we examined the effect of E3330 on the TLR ligand-stimulated expression of cytokines in BMDCs. Although treating BMDCs with LPS or Pam3 increased the secretion of IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α, the addition of E3330 did not further enhance the secretion of these cytokines. On the contrary, E3330 had a mild, but statistically significant inhibitory effect on the LPS-induced IL-12 level (Fig. 5). Because IL-12 plays a key role in Th1 differentiation, we further investigated the effect of E3330 on IL-12 expression. Notably, we found that E3330 significantly enhanced the Pam3-induced mRNA expression of Il12a and Il12b, which, respectively, encode the p35 and p40 subunits of IL-12 (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results suggested that E3330 enhances the IL-12 mRNA expression, but suppresses the IL-12 protein secretion. IL-12p70 is reported to be localized to the cell surface membrane before its secretion (14.Fan X. Sibalic V. Niederer E. Wüthrich R.P.

As expected, E3330 significantly up-regulated the surface expression of IL-12 on BMDCs (Fig. 7, A and B).FIGURE 6.E3330 enhances the Pam3-stimulated IL-12 gene expression in BMDCs.

Gene Med. 2004; 6: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17.Chakrabarti R. Chang Y. Song K. Prud'homme G.J. Plasmids encoding membrane-bound IL-4 or IL-12 strongly costimulate DNA vaccination against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).Vaccine. 2004; 22: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To confirm that the membrane-bound IL-12 retains its cytokine function, we stimulated splenic CD4+ T cells with various concentrations of plate-bound IL-12 and plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. The solid-phase IL-12 promoted the differentiation of CD4+ T cells to IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8). These results strongly suggested that instead of secreted, soluble IL-12, the IL-12 expressed on the APC surface enhanced Th1 differentiation. To gain insight into the intracellular signaling mechanisms that mediate the E3330-enhanced activation of IL-12 genes in BMDCs, we focused on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, one of the most conserved signaling pathways in mammalian cells. MAPKs consist of three major subgroups: the p38 MAPKs, extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs), and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs). The MAPKs play various roles in regulating Th1/Th2 balance (18.Re F. Strominger J.L. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 differentially activate human dendritic cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37692-37699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), and p38 MAPK is specifically involved in the regulation of IL-12 gene expression (19.Feng G.J. Goodridge H.S. Harnett M.M. Wei X.Q. Nikolaev A.V. Higson A.P. Liew F.Y. Extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases differentially regulate the lipopolysaccharide-mediated induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase and IL-12 in macrophages: Leishmania phosphoglycans subvert macrophage IL-12 production by targeting ERK MAP kinase.J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6403-6412PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of E3330 on p38 MAPK phosphorylation in BMDCs, and found that E3330-pretreated BMDCs exhibited enhanced p38 MAPK phosphorylation after Pam3 stimulation (Fig. 9A). This finding indicated that the redox function of Ape1/Ref-1 might inhibit the TLR ligand-induced p38 MAPK activation and IL-12 gene expression in APCs. To confirm the function of Ape1/Ref-1 in APCs, we performed Ape1/Ref-1 knockdown experiments with lentiviral vectors expressing Ape1/Ref-1-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA). First, we examined the knockdown efficiency of the Ape1/Ref-1 shRNA by monitoring the Ape1/Ref-1 protein levels in the virally infected BMDCs with an immunoblot assay. BMDCs infected with the Ape1/Ref-1 shRNA-encoding virus expressed lower levels of Ape1/Ref-1 protein on days 5 to 8 after infection, whereas BMDCs infected with control shRNA virus expressed similar levels of Ape1/Ref-1 as the uninfected control cells (Fig. 10A). The same membrane probed with an anti-actin antibody showed a similar expression of actin in each sample. The Ape1/Ref-1 knockdown BMDCs also expressed enhanced membrane-associated IL-12 (Fig. 10, B and C) and IL-12 transcript levels after Pam3 stimulation (Fig. 10D). To confirm the inhibitory effect of the redox function of Ape1/Ref-1 on p38 MAPK signaling in BMDCs, we analyzed the p38 MAPK activation in Ape1/Ref-1 knockdown BMDCs. Similar to the results obtained with the E3330-pretreated BMDCs, the p38 MAPK activation was enhanced in the Ape1/Ref-1 knockdown BMDCs upon Pam3 stimulation (Fig. 9B). Here we demonstrated that Ape1/Ref-1 modulated the helper T cell activation and differentiation through the modification of APC functions. The redox activity of Ape1/Ref-1 may regulate IL-12 production in BMDCs by two different mechanisms, one of which involves the transcriptional inhibition of both Il12a and Il12b, possibly through the inhibition of p38 MAPK activity, whereas the other involves the activation of IL-12 release from the cell surface. E3330, a specific inhibitor of the redox activity of Ape1/Ref-1, or the knockdown of Ape1/Ref-1 enhanced the TLR ligand-induced p38 MAPK activity and both IL-12 gene expressions. Inhibition of p38 MAPK activity using its specific inhibitor SB203580 reduced the E3330-enhanced IL-12 gene activations. 3A. Nasrin and H. Asao, unpublished observations. This result further supports the idea that inhibiting the redox activity of Ape1/Ref-1 enhanced the p38 MAPK activation, thereby enhancing the IL-12 gene activations. Because Ape1/Ref-1 is a multifunctional protein, it may regulate TLR signaling through molecules other than the p38 MAPK. For example, Ape1/Ref-1 is known to be required for AP-1 activity. Interestingly, TLR signaling-induced c-Fos expression and AP-1 activity appear to negatively regulate both IL-12 gene activations (20.Liu J. Cao S. Kim S. Chung E.Y. Homma Y. Guan X. Jimenez V. Ma X. Interleukin-12: an update on its immunological activities, signaling and regulation of gene expression.Curr. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 1: 119-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the TLR ligand stimulation-induced activity of ERK1/2, which are upstream signaling molecules of c-Fos and AP-1. However, E3330 had no effect on this ERK1/2 activity (data not shown), suggesting that the inhibition of Ape1/Ref-1 by E3330 mainly affects the p38 MAPK signaling in the BMDCs. IL-12 has both secreted and membrane-bound forms (14.Fan X. Sibalic V. Niederer E. Wüthrich R.P. The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 occurs as a cell membrane-bound form on macrophages.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1063-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15.Quinones M. Ahuja S.K. Melby P.C. Pate L. Reddick R.L. Ahuja S.S.

Med. 2000; 192: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Given the divergent effects of E3330 on cell surface retention and secretion of IL-12 from BMDCs, we hypothesized that the inactivation of the redox activity of Ape1/Ref-1 may inhibit shedding of IL-12 from the cell surface. IL-6 receptor, which shares sequence homology with IL-12p40 (21.Gearing D.P. Cosman D. Homology of the p40 subunit of natural killer cell stimulatory factor (NKSF) with the extracellular domain of the interleukin-6 receptor.Cell. 1991; 66: 9-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), is shed from the cell surface by a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), a member of the ADAM metalloprotease family that was originally identified as TACE (TNF-α converting enzyme), or ADAM10 (22.Althoff K. Reddy P. Voltz N. Rose-John S. Müllberg J. Shedding of interleukin-6 receptor and tumor necrosis factor α: contribution of the stalk sequence to the cleavage pattern of transmembrane proteins.Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2624-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 23.Matthews V. Schuster B. Schütze S. Bussmeyer I. Ludwig A. Hundhausen C. Sadowski T. Saftig P. Hartmann D. Kallen K.J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38829-38839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Therefore, a similar mechanism may be involved in IL-12 shedding from the cell surface. Thus, the inactivation of the redox activity of Ape1/Ref-1 may inhibit extracellular proteases, such as ADAM family enzymes, resulting in the accumulation of IL-12 on the cell surface. Further studies will be required to clarify the mechanism by which Ape1/Ref-1 controls the release of IL-12 from the cell surface. Cell surface-expressed IL-12 appears to be active, given that a genetically engineered membrane-bound form of IL-12 is biologically active (16.Ji J. Li J. Holmes L.M. Burgin K.E. Yu X. Wagner T.E. Wei Y. Synergistic anti-tumor effect of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored IL-2 and IL-12.J. Gene Med. 2004; 6: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17.Chakrabarti R. Chang Y.

Plasmids encoding membrane-bound IL-4 or IL-12 strongly costimulate DNA vaccination against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).Vaccine. 2004; 22: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and naïve Th cell activation requires cell-cell interaction with APCs via an immunological synapse. Furthermore, our finding that plate-bound IL-12 functions as a Th1-inducing cytokine strongly supports this possibility. Although we do not know whether the cell surface-expressed IL-12 is more effective for promoting the differentiation of Th1 cells than secreted IL-12, it is likely to be responsible for Th1 cell differentiation under physiological conditions. The Ape1/Ref-1 redox function-specific inhibitor E3330 has therapeutic potential for many tumors (24.Fishel M.L. Kelley M.R. The DNA base excision repair protein Ape1/Ref-1 as a therapeutic and chemopreventive target.Mol. Aspects Med. 2007; 28: 375-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Our finding that the inhibition of the redox function of Ape1/Ref-1 enhances the IFN-γ-producing Th1 response may reveal one of the mechanisms behind the E3330-induced anti-tumor activity in vivo. Ape1/Ref-1 redox suppression by small molecule inhibitors, such as E3330, may be a useful therapeutic approach for inducing anti-tumor immunity. C57BL/6J mice were purchased from CLEA Japan. OT-II transgenic mice (OT-II mice) (25.Barnden M.J. Allison J. Heath W.R. Carbone F.R.

Heath (WEHI, Melbourne, Australia). The mice were bred at the animal facilities of Yamagata University, Faculty of Medicine, under specific pathogen-free conditions and were used for experiments at 6–12 weeks of age. All of the animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of Yamagata University, Faculty of Medicine. E3330 was prepared as described previously (26.Luo M. Delaplane S. Jiang A.

The following reagents were used in this study: the synthetic OVA-(323–339) peptide (ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR, AnaSpec), synthetic triacylated lipoprotein-TLR1/2 ligand, Pam3CSK4 (InvivoGen), recombinant murine GM-CSF, recombinant murine IL-12 and recombinant human IL-2 (PeproTech), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Escherichia coli serotype 0127:B8), ionomycin calcium salt from Streptomycin conglobates, protease inhibitor mixture, phosphatase inhibitor mixture II, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture III (Sigma), and BD GolgiPlugTM Protein Transport Inhibitor (brefeldin A, BD Biosciences). Mouse spleen was homogenized with a glass homogenizer. The cell suspensions were passed through nylon mesh, and the cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing l-glutamine and 25 mm HEPES and supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (complete RPMI 1640 medium). CD4+ T cells were isolated using BDTM IMag anti-mouse CD4 particles (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To activate CD4+ T cells with Abs, purified CD4+ T cells were treated with anti-CD3ϵ (plate-bound, 10 μg/ml; catalog number 100314, lot number B133074, BioLegend) and anti-CD28 (2 μg/ml; catalog number 16-0281-85, lot number E06391-1637, eBioscience) Abs. To investigate whether solid-phase IL-12 functions as a cytokine, we pre-treated culture plates with recombinant murine IL-12 for 2 h at 37 °C. The IL-12 was washed out completely, and the plates were further coated with anti-CD3ϵ and anti-CD28 Abs. After rinsing these Abs, purified splenic CD4+ T cells were cultured in the pretreated plates in the presence of IL-2 (10 units/ml). BMDCs were prepared as previously described (27.Zhu W.

Briefly, bone marrow cells were isolated from the femurs and tibias of 5–10-week-old mice by flushing with PBS. The red blood cells were lysed using ACK buffer, and the cells were cultured in bacterial dishes in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 ng/ml of murine GM-CSF. The medium was replaced every 2 or 3 days, and the BMDCs that were generated after 6–8 days of culture were used in experiments. Intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry analysis of T cells were performed as described previously (28.Onoda T. Rahman M. Nara H. Araki A. Makabe K. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. Kudo T. Ishii N.

These cells were washed and resuspended in 3% (v/v) FCS-0.2 mg/ml NaN3-PBS. Cells were analyzed using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The data were analyzed with FlowJo software (version 7.6.1, Tree Star). Cytokines in the cell culture supernatants were analyzed by CBA (BD Biosciences) as described previously (29.Takeda Y.

A customized set of fluorescent anti-cytokine multiplex microbeads was obtained together with recombinant standards with which to prepare a standard curve for each cytokine. The assays were performed on a FACSCanto II flow cytometer, and the data were analyzed using FCAP Array software (version 1.0, BD Bioscience).

Thermo-cycling was performed using a LightCycler (Roche Molecular Systems). The IL-12 p35 and p40 mRNA levels were expressed relative to the corresponding β-actin mRNA level. The primer sets used in the real-time RT-PCR were as follows: mouse IL-12 p35 sense, 5′-ATGTGTCAATCACGCTACCTCC-3′ and antisense, 5′-GAAGAAGTCTCTCTAGTAGCCAGG-3′; mouse IL-12 p40 sense, 5′-GGGACATCATCAAACCAGACCC-3′ and antisense, 5′-GCCTTTGCATTGGACTTCGG-3′; mouse β-actin sense, 5′-TGACAGGATGCAGAAGGAGA-3′ and antisense, 5′-GCTGGAAGGTGGACAGTGAG-3′. The cell extraction and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously with some modifications (31.Asao H. Fu X.Y.

The cells were suspended in whole cell extraction buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture, 1% (v/v) phosphatase inhibitor mixture II and III, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF) and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. The extracted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Immun-blot PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in TBS supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20, and then incubated with anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182, 1:1,000; catalog number 9211, lot number 6, Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-APE-1 (1:20,000; catalog number NB100–116, lot number C-3, Novus Biologicals) Abs, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:2,000; catalog number 7074, Cell Signaling Technology) or HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000; catalog number 7076, Cell Signaling Technology) secondary Abs, respectively. To reprobe the membranes, they were soaked in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 2% (w/v) SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated for 30 min at 55 °C.

The signals were visualized using the ECL Prime detection system (Amersham Biosciences). An Ape1/Ref-1-shRNA-containing plasmid pLKO.1-puro-Ape1/Ref-1 shRNA (NM_009687.1–1033s1c1) and pLKO.1-puro-Non-Mammalian shRNA control plasmid (shc002) were purchased from Sigma. The lentiviral packaging plasmids pRSV-Rev, pMD.G, and pMDLg/pRRE were kindly provided by Dr. N. Tanaka (Division of Immunology, Miyagi Cancer Center Research Institute, Natori, Japan). The three viral packaging plasmids and the Ape1/Ref-1 shRNA or shRNA control plasmid were transfected into 293T cells using the calcium-phosphate method. The culture supernatants were recovered, and the viral titers were assessed. BMDCs were incubated with the viral supernatants at an multiplicity of infection of 2 with 8 μg/ml of Polybrene for 8 h. Thirty-two hours after infection, 2 μg/ml of puromycin (Sigma) was added to the culture medium and the cells were further cultured for 7 days to select the virally infected BMDCs. The statistical analysis of pairwise comparisons between two or more samples was performed by Student's t test using the R software (version 3.2.2). p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. N. Akhter conducted most of the experiments, analyzed the results, and wrote most of the paper. Y. T. conducted experiments on the flow cytometry analysis. H. N. and A. A. conducted cell culture experiments and BMDCs establishment. N. I. conducted experiments using OTII mice. N. Asao prepared E3330 and H. A. conceived the idea for the project, conducted the knockdown experiments, and wrote the paper with N. Akhter. We thank Dr. N. Tanaka for the gifts of the retrovirus packaging plasmids."
https://openalex.org/W2520979825,"Mammalian KIF3AB is an N-terminal processive kinesin-2 that is best known for its roles in intracellular transport. There has been significant interest in KIF3AB to define the key principles that underlie its processivity but also to define the mechanistic basis of its sensitivity to force. In this study, the kinetics for entry into the processive run were quantified. The results show for KIF3AB that the kinetics of microtubule association at 7 μm−1 s−1 is less than the rates observed for KIF3AA at 13 μm−1 s−1 or KIF3BB at 11.9 μm−1 s−1. ADP release after microtubule association for KIF3AB is 33 s−1 and is significantly slower than ADP release from homodimeric KIF3AA and KIF3BB, which reach 80–90 s−1. To explore the interhead communication implied by the rate differences at these first steps, we compared the kinetics of KIF3AB microtubule association followed by ADP release with the kinetics for mixtures of KIF3AA plus KIF3BB. Surprisingly, the kinetics of KIF3AB are not equivalent to any of the mixtures of KIF3AA + KIF3BB. In fact, the transients for each of the mixtures overlay the transients for KIF3AA and KIF3BB. These results reveal that intermolecular communication within the KIF3AB heterodimer modulates entry into the processive run, and the results suggest that it is the high rate of microtubule association that drives rebinding to the microtubule after force-dependent motor detachment.

These nodal cilia are crucial for the proper mesodermal patterning during embryogenesis to establish the left-right body asymmetry. Other studies have linked KIF3AB-KAP to cilia-dependent signal transduction cascades including the Hedgehog signaling pathway (26.Huangfu D. Liu A. Rakeman A.S. Murcia N.S. Niswander L. Anderson K.V.

The role of intraflagellar transport in ciliogenesis is considered the basis for KIF3AB-KAP to be an essential protein for development. KIF3AB-KAP is also implicated in a variety of cytoplasmic transport events including organelles, melanosomes, mRNA granules, and membrane-bound vesicles (2.Hirokawa N. Niwa S. Tanaka Y.

Kinesin-2 KIF3AB is clearly implicated in diverse but specific transport events as is conventional kinesin-1, suggesting that the mechanochemical properties of these two kinesins are in some way tuned differently and specifically for their cellular roles because one is not redundant for the other. One distinctive characteristic of KIF3AB and its orthologs is their response to hindering loads (18.Brunnbauer M. Mueller-Planitz F. Kösem S. Ho T.H. Dombi R. Gebhardt J.C. Rief M. Okten Z.

More recently, Andreasson et al. (34.Andreasson J.O. Shastry S. Hancock W.O. Block S.M. The mechanochemical cycle of mammalian kinesin-2 KIF3A/B under load.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 1166-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reported that the processivity of murine KIF3AB is strongly force-dependent and dropped precipitously when hindering force was applied such that runs consisted of less than 25 steps at 4 pN. However, the other property observed for each of these kinesin-2 motors regardless of species was that upon detachment they were able to rebind the microtubule quickly and initiate another processive run. These observations have resulted in the hypothesis that kinesin-2 motors are tuned specifically to navigate microtubule (MT) roadblocks such as microtubule-associated proteins like tau in neurons (40.Hoeprich G.J. Thompson A.R. McVicker D.P. Hancock W.O. Berger C.L. Kinesin's neck-linker determines its ability to navigate obstacles on the microtubule surface.Biophys.

Cell Biol. 2015; 17: 1536-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A presteady-state ATPase kinetics analysis of the steps for entry into the processive run was pursued to ask whether there are intrinsic characteristics within KIF3AB that account for its rapid rebinding to the microtubule after detachment. For these studies, we used motors that were co-expressed from mouse KIF3A and KIF3B constructs that included the native sequence for the motor domain and native helix α7 to initiate coiled coil formation followed by a synthetic heterodimerization domain (SHD) as an extension of the native helix to stabilize the native dimer (42.Albracht C.D.

Our recent single molecule studies (43.Guzik-Lendrum S. Rank K.C. Bensel B.M. Taylor K.C. Rayment I. Gilbert S.P.

The run lengths of KIF3AA and KIF3BB showed that both were highly processive, although the run length of KIF3BB at 1.51 μm is greater than KIF3AA at 1 μm and more similar to the run length of KIF3AB (Table 1). Homodimers of KIF3AA and KIF3BB do not appear to occur in vivo, but they provide a tool to assess the motor properties of KIF3A and KIF3B separately. Therefore, we engineered similarly designed constructs for their expression (43.Guzik-Lendrum S. Rank K.C. Bensel B.M. Taylor K.C. Rayment I. Gilbert S.P.

The experiments presented here include an analysis of KIF3AB, KIF3AA, and KIF3BB to ask specifically whether heterodimerization alters the intrinsic properties of KIF3A and KIF3B and to define the characteristics of KIF3AB that enable this kinesin to rebind the microtubule so quickly after detachment.TABLE 1KIF3AB, KIF3AA, and KIF3BB experimentally determined constantsKIF3ABKIF3AAKIF3BBMicrotubule associationk+1 = 7.0 ± 0.4 μm−1 s−1k+1 = 13.0 ± 0.5 μm−1 s−1k+1 = 11.9 ± 0.1 μm−1 s−1k−1 = 0.8 ± 0.4 s−1k−1 = not observedk−1 = not observedADP releasek+2 = 33.5 ± 0.6 s−1k+2 = 89.9 ± 3.4 s−1k+2 = 80.2 ± 2.5 s−1K1/2,MT = 3.1 ± 0.2 μmK1/2,MT = 5.3 ± 0.5 μmK1/2,MT = 4.0 ± 0.4 μmMantATP bindingaConstants reported previously (42, 43).k+3 = 7.5 ± 0.5 μm−1 s−1NDNDk−3 = 46.1 ± 5.5 s−1Steady-state parametersaConstants reported previously (42, 43).kcat = 14.8 ± 0.8 s−1kcat = 34.7 ± 0.5 s−1kcat = 32.1 ± 0.4 s−1Km,ATP = 118 ± 7.7 μmKm,ATP = 47.7 ± 0.1 μmKm,ATP = 71.4 ± 4.0 μmK1/2,MT = 0.12 ± 0.1 μmK1/2,MT = 0.19 ± 0.002 μmK1/2,MT = 0.14 ± 0.005 μmVelocitybSingle molecule motility parameters reported in Ref. 43.246.2 ± 11.1 nm/s239.2 ± 4.2 nm/s327.6 ± 7.2 nm/sRun lengthbSingle molecule motility parameters reported in Ref. 43.1.62 ± 0.11 μm0.98 ± 0.05 μm1.51 ± 0.16 μma Constants reported previously (42.Albracht C.D.

Open table in a new tab Scheme 1 represents the KIF3AB ATPase cycle, and Fig. 1 presents the proposed steps for entry into the processive run. These were used to design the presteady-state experiments presented. In Table 1, the experimentally determined kinetic and equilibrium constants are reported for heterodimeric KIF3AB and homodimeric KIF3AA and KIF3BB. Albracht et al. (42.Albracht C.D. Rank K.C.

Therefore, we wanted to take a fresh look at the ATPase cycle and design different experiments to explore entry into the processive run. The first experiments tested the hypothesis of whether there is an intrinsic bias resulting from heterodimerization of KIF3A and KIF3B that will lead to one head preferentially starting the processive run. We began by measuring the presteady-state kinetics of MT collision followed by mantADP release for homodimeric KIF3AA and KIF3BB in comparison with results for KIF3AB (42.Albracht C.D. Rank K.C.

For these experiments ADP at the active site was exchanged with mantADP (1:6 ratio of KIF3 nucleotide sites to mantADP). The KIF3-mantADP complex was rapidly mixed in the stopped-flow instrument with varying concentrations of MTs plus 2 mm MgATP. The transients in Fig. 2A show a biphasic decrease in fluorescence as a function of time due to fluorescence quenching when mantADP is released from the active site to the aqueous buffer. The observed rates of the initial fast exponential phase were plotted as a function of MT concentration, and the results in Fig. 2B reveal that the maximum rate constant for mantADP from KIF3BB at 21.3 s−1 is faster than this rate constant for KIF3AA at 14.4 s−1 with mantADP release for KIF3AB reported at 12.8 s−1 (42.Albracht C.D. Rank K.C. Obrzut S. Rayment I. Gilbert S.P. Kinesin-2 KIF3AB exhibits novel ATPase characteristics.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 27836-27848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). At low MT concentrations, mantADP release is limited by MT collision; therefore, the observed rates plotted as a function of increasing MT concentrations can provide the second-order rate constant for MT association. Fig. 2C shows that the MT association constant for KIF3BB at 12.7 μm−1 s−1 is faster than this constant observed for KIF3AA at 8.3 μm−1 s−1 in comparison with 5.7 μm−1 s−1 observed for KIF3AB using the same experimental approach (42.Albracht C.D.

Therefore, we designed a new experiment to test the hypothesis that mantADP may not capture the kinetics of native ADP release from KIFAB, KIF3AA, and KIF3BB. A similar experimental design was"
https://openalex.org/W2521001620,"The ability of a pathogenic bacterium to scavenge iron from its host is important for its growth and survival during an infection. Our studies on C. perfringens gas gangrene strain JIR325, a derivative of strain 13, showed that it is capable of utilizing both human hemoglobin and ferric chloride, but not human holo-transferrin, as an iron source for in vitro growth. Analysis of the C. perfringens strain 13 genome sequence identified a putative heme acquisition system encoded by an iron-regulated surface gene region that we have named the Cht (Clostridium perfringens heme transport) locus. This locus comprises eight genes that are co-transcribed and includes genes that encode NEAT domain-containing proteins (ChtD and ChtE) and a putative sortase (Srt). The ChtD, ChtE and Srt proteins were shown to be expressed in JIR325 cells grown under iron-limited conditions and were localized to the cell envelope. Moreover, the NEAT proteins, ChtD and ChtE, were found to bind heme. Both chtDE and srt mutants were constructed, but these mutants were not defective in hemoglobin or ferric chloride utilization. They were, however, attenuated for virulence when tested in a mouse myonecrosis model, although the virulence phenotype could not be restored via complementation and, as is common with such systems, secondary mutations were identified in these strains. In summary, this study provides evidence for the functional redundancies that occur in the heme transport pathways of this life threatening pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2519881587,"The NHE1 isoform of the mammalian Na+/H+ exchanger is a ubiquitous plasma membrane protein that regulates intracellular pH in mammalian cells by removing one intracellular proton in exchange for one extracellular sodium. Deletion of the NHE1 gene (SLC9A1) affects the growth and motor ability of mice and humans but mutations and polymorphisms of the gene are only beginning to be characterized. NHE1 has a cytosolic C-terminal regulatory tail of approximately 315 amino acids and a 500 amino acid membrane domain. We examined the functional effects of three human stop codon mutations at amino acids 321, 449 and 735 in comparison with a mutant that had a shortened tail region (543 stop codon). The short mutants, 321, 449 and 543 stop codon mutant proteins, lost NHE1 activity and expression, and did not target to the plasma membrane. Protein for these short mutants was more rapidly degraded than the wild type and 735 ending proteins. The 735 terminating mutant, with the membrane domain and much of the cytosolic tail, had reduced protein expression and activity. The results demonstrate that early stop codon polymorphisms have significant and deleterious effects on the activity of the SLC9A1 protein product. The 735-NHE1 mutant, without the last 80 amino acids, had more minor defects. Surprisingly, retention of a proximal 43 amino acids adjacent to the membrane domain did little to maintain NHE1 expression, targeting and activity."
https://openalex.org/W2519370175,"Ingenol mebutate (IngMeb) is an effective treatment for actinic keratosis. In this study, we hypothesized that repeated treatments with IngMeb may prevent progression of UV-induced photodamage, and that concurrent application of a corticosteroid may reduce IngMeb-induced local skin responses (LSR).Hairless mice (n = 60; 3 groups of 20 mice) were irradiated with solar simulated ultraviolet radiation (UVR) throughout the study. Five single treatments with IngMeb were given at 4-week intervals (Days 21, 49, 77, 105, and 133). Clobetasol propionate (CP) was applied once daily for 5 days prior to each IngMeb application, as well as 6 h and 1 day post treatment. One week after IngMeb treatment No. 1, 3, and 5 (Days 28, 84, and 140), biopsies from four mice in each group were collected for histological evaluation of UV-damage on a standardized UV-damage scale (0-12). LSR (0-24) were assessed once daily (Days 1-7) after each IngMeb treatment.IngMeb prevented progression of photodamage in terms of keratosis grade, epidermal hypertrophy, dysplasia, and dermal actinic damage with a lower composite UV-damage score on day 140 (UVR 10.25 vs. UVR+IngMeb 6.00, p = 0.002) compared to UVR alone. IngMeb induced LSR, including erythema, flaking, crusting, bleeding, vesiculation, and ulceration. Concurrent CP increased LSR (max LSR Tx 1-5: UVR+IngMeb+CP 3.6-5.5 vs. UVR+IngMeb 2.6-4.3) and provided better prevention of photodamage compared to IngMeb alone (Day 140: UVR+IngMeb 6.00 vs. UVR+IngMeb+CP 3.00 p < 0.001).Repeated field-directed treatments with IngMeb prevent progression of cutaneous photodamage in hairless mice, while CP cannot be used to alleviate IngMeb-induced LSR. The findings suggest that IngMeb may potentially serve as a prophylactic treatment for UV-induced tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2519431192,"Actin nucleation is the key rate limiting step in the process of actin polymerization, and tight regulation of this process is critical to ensure actin filaments form only at specific times and at defined regions of the cell. Arp2/3 is a well-characterised protein complex that can promote nucleation of new filaments, though its activity requires additional nucleation promotion factors (NPFs). The best recognized of these factors are the WASP family of proteins that contain binding motifs for both monomeric actin and for Arp2/3. Previously we demonstrated that the yeast WASP homologue, Las17, in addition to activating Arp2/3 can also nucleate actin filaments de novo, independently of Arp2/3. This activity is dependent on its polyproline rich region. Through biochemical and in vivo analysis we have now identified key motifs within the polyproline region that are required for nucleation and elongation of actin filaments, and have addressed the role of the WH2 domain in the context of actin nucleation without Arp2/3. We have also demonstrated that full length Las17 is able to bind liposomes giving rise to the possibility of direct linkage of nascent actin filaments to specific membrane sites to which Las17 has been recruited. Overall, we propose that Las17 functions as the key initiator of de novo actin filament formation at endocytic sites by nucleating, elongating and tethering nascent filaments which then serve as a platform for Arp2/3 recruitment and function."
https://openalex.org/W2520749604,"The discovery of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) is a challenging problem in computational biology. Limited by the difficulty of using an HMM to model dependent features in transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRSs), the probabilistic modeling methods based on HMMs cannot accurately represent the distance between regulatory elements in TRSs and are cumbersome to model the prevailing dependencies between motifs within CRMs. We propose a probabilistic modeling algorithm called SMCis, which builds a more powerful CRM discovery model based on a hidden semi-Markov model. Our model characterizes the regulatory structure of CRMs and effectively models dependencies between motifs at a higher level of abstraction based on segments rather than nucleotides. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets indicate that our method performs better than the compared algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2522827953,"Lumen formation and maintenance are important for the development and function of essential organs such as the lung, kidney and vasculature. In the Drosophila embryonic trachea, lumena form de novo to connect the different tracheal branches into an interconnected network of tubes. Here, we identify a novel role for the receptor type guanylyl cyclase at 76C (Gyc76C) in de novo lumen formation in the Drosophila trachea. We show that in embryos mutant for gyc76C or its downsteam effector protein kinase G (PKG) 1, tracheal lumena are disconnected. Dorsal trunk (DT) cells of gyc76C mutant embryos migrate to contact each other and complete the initial steps of lumen formation, such as the accumulation of E-cadherin (E-cad) and formation of an actin track at the site of lumen formation. However, the actin track and E-cad contact site of gyc76C mutant embryos did not mature to become a new lumen and DT lumena did not fuse. We also observed failure of the luminal protein Vermiform to be secreted into the site of new lumen formation in gyc76C mutant trachea. These DT lumen formation defects were accompanied by altered localization of the Arf-like 3 GTPase (Arl3), a known regulator of vesicle-vesicle and vesicle-membrane fusion. In addition to the DT lumen defect, lumena of gyc76C mutant terminal cells were shorter compared to wild-type cells. These studies show that Gyc76C and downstream PKG-dependent signaling regulate de novo lumen formation in the tracheal DT and terminal cells, most likely by affecting Arl3-mediated luminal secretion."
