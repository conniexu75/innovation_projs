https://openalex.org/W4309233139,"The mixtures of cations and anions used in hybrid halide perovskites for high-performance solar cells often undergo element and phase segregation, which limits device lifetime. We adapted Schelling’s model of segregation to study individual cation migration and found that the initial film inhomogeneity accelerates materials degradation. We fabricated perovskite films (FA 1–x Cs x PbI 3 ; where FA is formamidinium) through the addition of selenophene, which led to homogeneous cation distribution that retarded cation aggregation during materials processing and device operation. The resultant devices achieved enhanced efficiency and retained &gt;91% of their initial efficiency after 3190 hours at the maximum power point under 1 sun illumination. We also observe prolonged operational lifetime in devices with initially homogeneous FACsPb(Br 0.13 I 0.87 ) 3 absorbers."
https://openalex.org/W4309233014,"The observation of genetic correlations between disparate human traits has been interpreted as evidence of widespread pleiotropy. Here, we introduce cross-trait assortative mating (xAM) as an alternative explanation. We observe that xAM affects many phenotypes and that phenotypic cross-mate correlation estimates are strongly associated with genetic correlation estimates ( R 2 = 74%). We demonstrate that existing xAM plausibly accounts for substantial fractions of genetic correlation estimates and that previously reported genetic correlation estimates between some pairs of psychiatric disorders are congruent with xAM alone. Finally, we provide evidence for a history of xAM at the genetic level using cross-trait even/odd chromosome polygenic score correlations. Together, our results demonstrate that previous reports have likely overestimated the true genetic similarity between many phenotypes."

Because of the inherent electronic properties of pyridines, selective meta-C-H functionalization is challenging. Here, we present a protocol for highly regioselective meta-C-H trifluoromethylation, perfluoroalkylation, chlorination, bromination, iodination, nitration, sulfanylation, and selenylation of pyridines through a redox-neutral dearomatization-rearomatization process. The introduced dearomative activation mode provides a diversification platform for meta-selective reactions on pyridines and other azaarenes through radical as well as ionic pathways. The broad scope and high selectivity of these catalyst-free reactions render these processes applicable for late-stage functionalization of drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4309232842,"Plant roots exhibit plasticity in their branching patterns to forage efficiently for heterogeneously distributed resources, such as soil water. The xerobranching response represses lateral root formation when roots lose contact with water. Here, we show that xerobranching is regulated by radial movement of the phloem-derived hormone abscisic acid, which disrupts intercellular communication between inner and outer cell layers through plasmodesmata. Closure of these intercellular pores disrupts the inward movement of the hormone signal auxin, blocking lateral root branching. Once root tips regain contact with moisture, the abscisic acid response rapidly attenuates. Our study reveals how roots adapt their branching pattern to heterogeneous soil water conditions by linking changes in hydraulic flux with dynamic hormone redistribution."

https://openalex.org/W4309232851,"Pyridine halogenation reactions are crucial for obtaining the vast array of derivatives required for drug and agrochemical development. However, despite more than a century of synthetic endeavors, halogenation processes that selectively functionalize the carbon-hydrogen bond in the 3-position of a broad range of pyridine precursors remain largely elusive. We report a reaction sequence of pyridyl ring opening, halogenation, and ring closing whereby the acyclic Zincke imine intermediates undergo highly regioselective halogenation reactions under mild conditions. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that the nature of the halogen electrophile can modify the selectivity-determining step. Using this method, we produced a diverse set of 3-halopyridines and demonstrated late-stage halogenation of complex pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals."
https://openalex.org/W4309232845,"Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between molecular vibrations and microcavity photons yields a few polaritons (light-matter modes) and many dark modes (with negligible photonic character). Although VSC is reported to alter thermally activated chemical reactions, its mechanisms remain opaque. To elucidate this problem, we followed ultrafast dynamics of a simple unimolecular vibrational energy exchange in iron pentacarbonyl [Fe(CO) 5 ] under VSC, which showed two competing channels: pseudorotation and intramolecular vibrational-energy redistribution (IVR). We found that under polariton excitation, energy exchange was overall accelerated, with IVR becoming faster and pseudorotation being slowed down. However, dark-mode excitation revealed unchanged dynamics compared with those outside of the cavity, with pseudorotation dominating. Thus, despite controversies around thermally activated VSC modified chemistry, our work shows that VSC can indeed alter chemistry through a nonequilibrium preparation of polaritons."
https://openalex.org/W4309233013,"Inherent symmetry of a quantum system may protect its otherwise fragile states. Leveraging such protection requires testing its robustness against uncontrolled environmental interactions. Using 47 superconducting qubits, we implement the one-dimensional kicked Ising model, which exhibits nonlocal Majorana edge modes (MEMs) with [Formula: see text] parity symmetry. We find that any multiqubit Pauli operator overlapping with the MEMs exhibits a uniform late-time decay rate comparable to single-qubit relaxation rates, irrespective of its size or composition. This characteristic allows us to accurately reconstruct the exponentially localized spatial profiles of the MEMs. Furthermore, the MEMs are found to be resilient against certain symmetry-breaking noise owing to a prethermalization mechanism. Our work elucidates the complex interplay between noise and symmetry-protected edge modes in a solid-state environment."
https://openalex.org/W4309233024,"The Hippo signaling pathway is widely considered a master regulator of organ growth because of the prominent overgrowth phenotypes caused by experimental manipulation of its activity. Contrary to this model, we show here that removing Hippo transcriptional output did not impair the ability of the mouse liver and Drosophila eyes to grow to their normal size. Moreover, the transcriptional activity of the Hippo pathway effectors Yap/Taz/Yki did not correlate with cell proliferation, and hyperactivation of these effectors induced gene expression programs that did not recapitulate normal development. Concordantly, a functional screen in Drosophila identified several Hippo pathway target genes that were required for ectopic overgrowth but not normal growth. Thus, Hippo signaling does not instruct normal growth, and the Hippo-induced overgrowth phenotypes are caused by the activation of abnormal genetic programs."

https://openalex.org/W4309232846,"Natural materials exhibit emergent mechanical properties as a result of their nanoarchitected, nanocomposite structures with optimized hierarchy, anisotropy, and nanoporosity. Fabrication of such complex systems is currently challenging because high-quality three-dimensional (3D) nanoprinting is mostly limited to simple, homogeneous materials. We report a strategy for the rapid nanoprinting of complex structural nanocomposites using metal nanoclusters. These ultrasmall, quantum-confined nanoclusters function as highly sensitive two-photon activators and simultaneously serve as precursors for mechanical reinforcements and nanoscale porogens. Nanocomposites with complex 3D architectures are printed, as well as structures with tunable, hierarchical, and anisotropic nanoporosity. Nanocluster-polymer nanolattices exhibit high specific strength, energy absorption, deformability, and recoverability. This framework provides a generalizable, versatile approach for the use of photoactive nanomaterials in additive manufacturing of complex systems with emergent mechanical properties."
https://openalex.org/W4309233026,"Meiotic spindle assembly ensures proper chromosome segregation in oocytes. However, the mechanisms behind spindle assembly in human oocytes remain largely unknown. We used three-dimensional high-resolution imaging of more than 2000 human oocytes to identify a structure that we named the human oocyte microtubule organizing center (huoMTOC). The proteins TACC3, CCP110, CKAP5, and DISC1 were found to be essential components of the huoMTOC. The huoMTOC arises beneath the oocyte cortex and migrates adjacent to the nuclear envelope before nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD). After NEBD, the huoMTOC fragments and relocates on the kinetochores to initiate microtubule nucleation and spindle assembly. Disrupting the huoMTOC led to spindle assembly defects and oocyte maturation arrest. These results reveal a physiological mechanism of huoMTOC-regulated spindle assembly in human oocytes."

https://openalex.org/W4309263956,"Many human cancers manifest the capability to circumvent attack by the adaptive immune system. In this work, we identified a component of immune evasion that involves frequent up-regulation of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in solid tumors. FMRP represses immune attack, as revealed by cancer cells engineered to lack its expression. FMRP-deficient tumors were infiltrated by activated T cells that impaired tumor growth and enhanced survival in mice. Mechanistically, FMRP’s immunosuppression was multifactorial, involving repression of the chemoattractant C-C motif chemokine ligand 7 (CCL7) concomitant with up-regulation of three immunomodulators—interleukin-33 (IL-33), tumor-secreted protein S (PROS1), and extracellular vesicles. Gene signatures associate FMRP’s cancer network with poor prognosis and response to therapy in cancer patients. Collectively, FMRP is implicated as a regulator that orchestrates a multifaceted barrier to antitumor immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W4309264169,"China is in a critical period of economic restructuring and optimization, and the vigorous development of the digital economy plays a vital role in the transformation and upgrading of the industrial structure. Using the panel data of 249 prefecture-level cities from 2011 to 2018, this study empirically investigates the relationship and mechanism between digital economy and industrial structure upgrading. The results show that the digital economy significantly promotes the upgrading of the industrial structure, and this conclusion is still valid after robustness tests such as selecting historical data as instrumental variables. The analysis of the mechanism of action shows that the improvement of labor efficiency and the promotion of technology spillover are the important mechanisms of the digital economy to promote industrial structure upgrading. Finally, the study of regional differences shows that the eastern region has the most obvious promotion effect of digital economy development, the central region is the second, and the western region has the least impact. The research here promotes the understanding of the motivation of industrial structure upgrading and the effect, mechanism, and regional differences of the digital economy enabling the development of a modern industrial system."

https://openalex.org/W4309263967,"Holins are bacteriophage-encoded transmembrane proteins that function to control the timing of bacterial lysis event, assist with the destabilization of the membrane proton motive force and in some models, generate large “pores” in the cell membrane to allow the exit of the phage-encoded endolysin so they can access the peptidoglycan components of the cell wall. The lysis mechanism has been rigorously evaluated through biochemical and genetic studies in very few phages, and the results indicate that phages utilize endolysins, holins and accessory proteins to the outer membrane to achieve cell lysis through several distinct operational models. This observation suggests the possibility that phages may evolve novel variations of how the lysis proteins functionally interact in an effort to improve fitness or evade host defenses. To begin to address this hypothesis, the current study utilized a comprehensive bioinformatic approach to systematically identify the proteins encoded by the genes within the lysis cassettes in 16 genetically diverse phages that infect the Gram-positive Gordonia rubripertincta NRLL B-16540 strain. The results show that there is a high level of diversity of the various lysis genes and 16 different genome organizations of the putative lysis cassette, many which have never been described. Thirty-four different genes encoding holin-like proteins were identified as well as a potential holin-major capsid fusion protein. The holin-like proteins contained between 1–4 transmembrane helices, were not shared to a high degree amongst the different phages and are present in the lysis cassette in a wide range of combinations of up to 4 genes in which none are duplicated. Detailed evaluation of the transmembrane domains and predicted membrane topologies of the holin-like proteins show that many have novel structures that have not been previously characterized. These results provide compelling support that there are novel operational lysis models yet to be discovered."

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate risk factors for fear of falling among Palestinian older adults in Hebron district.A cross-sectional study was conducted among Palestinians > 60 years living in Hebron, West Bank. The Falls Efficacy Scale-International was used to predict falls among Palestinian older adults. Moreover, socio-demographic data, medical history, lifestyle habits, body composition, nutritional status, cognitive status (using the Montreal cognitive assessment tool), and functional status (using activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living scale), the presence of depressive symptoms (using geriatric depression scale), and physical fitness performance (using senior fitness test) were collected through an interview-based questionnaire. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate approach.A total of 200 participants were included in the study; 137 (68.5%) females and 63 (31.5%) males. Mean age was 70.5 ± 5.7 years, ranged from 65 to 98 years old. Fear of falling was significantly higher among older adults with advanced aged, living in villages or camps, low educational level, and being married (p < 0.05). Functional status (ADL and IADL), physical fitness status (timed up and go), and depression symptoms were significantly related to fear of falling (p < 0.05).High concern of falling is significantly associated with advanced age, low education level, being married, and living in villages or camps. ADLs were among the factors that had a significant relationship with increased fear of falling. Predictors of fear of falling among Palestinian older adults were IADL scores, body fat percentage, rapid gait speed, timed up and go test. Future studies could investigate further correlates of fear of falling among older adults."
https://openalex.org/W4309264117,"Badminton is a racket sport that requires a wide variety of proficient postural changes and moves including jumps, lunges, quick changes in direction, and rapid arm movements. Efficient movement in badminton court entails reaching the shuttlecock in as few steps as possible while maintaining good balance. Balance training is an unexplored component in badminton training protocol, though balance is important in injury prevention and performance enhancement. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of balance training on sport-specific footwork performance of school-level competitive badminton players. We conducted a controlled trial involving 20 male badminton players (age 12.85±0.67 years). Participants were stratified according to their level of performance in the game, and payers from each stratum were randomly assigned to control and intervention groups. The control group (n = 8) engaged in 2 hours of ordinary badminton training, whereas the intervention group (n = 12) underwent 30 minutes of balance training followed by 1 hour and 30 minutes of ordinary badminton training, 2 days per week for 8 weeks. We tested the participants at baseline and after 8 weeks for static balance (Unipedal Stance Test), dynamic balance (Star Excursion Balance Test) and sport-specific footwork performance (shuttle run time and push-off times during stroke-play). On pre- vs. post-intervention comparisons, both groups improved in static balance (eyes opened) (p<0.05), but only the intervention group improved in dynamic balance (p = 0.036) and shuttle-run time (p = 0.020). The intervention group also improved push-off times for front forehand (p = 0.045), side forehand (p = 0.029) and rear around-the-head shots (p = 0.041). These improvements in push-off times varied between 19-36% of the baseline. None of the footwork performance measures significantly improved in the control group. Our findings indicate that incorporating a 30-minute balance training program into a regular training schedule improves dynamic balance, and on-court sport-specific footwork performance in adolescent competitive badminton players, after 8 weeks of training."
https://openalex.org/W4309218544,"Obstetricians describe feeling shocked and isolated following stillbirth. Few receive adequate training in how to care for bereaved parents or themselves. We developed a novel workshop for trainee obstetricians using applied drama techniques-in collaboration with the National Theatre of Ireland, the national training body for obstetricians and gynaecologists, and patient support groups-to teach obstetricians skills in communication and self-care around the time of stillbirth.Five workshops, delivered January-May 2018, are the focus of this evaluation. Senior trainees in Obstetrics attended and completed a post-workshop evaluation questionnaire. Five-point Likert scales were used to assess participants' communication and support skills pre- and post- the workshop, and their views on pre-specified attributes needed when caring for families experiencing stillbirth and aspects of the workshop. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis, respectively.39/59 (66%) workshop participants completed the questionnaires. Most had received no prior training in caring for families experiencing antenatal (31/39, 80%) or intrapartum (34/39, 87%) stillbirth. Following the workshop there was a significant improvement in trainee's level of confidence in breaking bad news, communicating clearly with the family when breaking bad news, recognising the emotional needs of the family, recognising their own emotional responses, and supporting their colleagues. Trainees were positive about the workshop content and delivery; 90% stated they would recommend it to a colleague.Adequate, appropriate, and stimulating education and training in stillbirth care and self-care is clearly needed to improve patient care. Our findings demonstrate that this novel educational workshop using applied drama techniques-developed in collaboration with diverse stakeholders and underpinned by the views of parents and obstetricians who had experience of stillbirth-is an acceptable and appropriate way of training obstetricians in how to care for bereaved parents and/or to engage in self-care."

Surprisingly, about 2.5 million occur in women under the age of 20 years. Aim of this study is to measure the level of contraceptive utilization and associated factors among youths in Hosanna town administration.Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted in Hossana town administration, Hadiya zone, Southern Ethiopia. A multistage sampling procedure was employed by clustering health facilities into reproductive health clubs and health facilities to select 781 study participants. Data was collected by using structured pre-tested, self-administered questionnaires. All coded and cleaned data were entered into EPI-info version 3.5.1 and it was exported to SPSS version 16.0 for recoding and further analysis.Among youths who had been sexually active within the last 12 months, 67.6% had used contraceptives prior to the survey. Multivariate analysis was found statistically significant association between contraceptive utilization and education status of mothers who attained university AOR = 4.57 [95% CI (1.29, 16.19)], utilization of sexual and reproductive health services within last 12 months AOR = 2.26 [(95% CI: 1.33, 3.86)], age initiation of first sex between 15-19 year OR = 2.63 [(95% CI 1.48,4.64)], discussion with sexual partner AOR = 1.99 [(95% CI: 1.27, 3.13)], good knowledge on contraceptive advantage AOR = [1.89 (95%CI: 1.07, 3.32)]. Whereas educational status: being secondary level decrease utilization of contraceptives by 51% AOR = 0.49 [95% CI (0.27, 0.94)].The findings of our study imply that level of contraceptive utilization is higher than as compared to the previous studies. Discussion with a sexual partner as well as with a spouse, having awareness on contraceptive advantages, early age initiation of sexual intercourse, maternal educational status and getting sexual and reproductive health services recently were identified as predictors of contraceptive utilization."
https://openalex.org/W4309264168,"Background and aim Multidrug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is associated with nosocomial infections in both outbreak and non-outbreak situations. The study intends to evaluate the potential of enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus- polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR), a genomic based typing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) proteomic-based typing techniques for clonal relatedness among multidrug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. Methodology Multidrug resistant clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae ( n = 137) were collected from March 2019 to February 2020. Identification and protein-based phylogenetic analysis were performed by MALDI-TOF MS. Genomic typing was done by ERIC-PCR and analyzed by an online data analysis service (PyElph). Dice method with unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) program was used to compare the ERIC profiles. The samples were also evaluated by PCR for the presence of genes encoding carbapenemases, extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs) and mobile colistin resistance-1 ( mcr1 ). Result and conclusion The study presents ERIC-PCR as more robust and better discriminatory typing tool in comparison to MALDI-TOF for clonal relatedness in multidrug resistant K . pneumoniae clinical isolates. Isolates were typed into 40 ERIC types, and six groups by MALDI-TOF-MS. PCR-based analysis revealed that all the strains harbored two or more ESBL and carbapenemase genes. None of the isolates revealed the presence of the plasmid mediated mcr-1 gene for colistin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4309218234,"Osteoclasts are the only multinucleated cells in vivo responsible for bone resorption and are vital for regulating bone remodeling and maintaining bone mass. The RAW264.7 cell line is widely used to study osteoclastic differentiation and biological molecular mechanism. However, protocols for inducing osteoclast formation in RAW264.7 cells vary considerably between laboratories, hindering the replication of results. Therefore, we tested the influence of culture conditions on osteoclast differentiation, including cell density and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) concentrations with or without macrophage colony-stimulating factors (M-CSF). Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining was used to detect the morphology of osteoclasts. qPCR was used to detect gene expression of osteoclast-specific gene marker cathepsin K (CTSK), osteoclast transcription factors c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). The bone resorption function was evaluated by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). RANKL treatment increased multinucleated osteoclasts formation and increased CTSK, c-Fos and NFATc1 gene expression. Compared with RANKL treatment, M-CSF significantly decreased multinucleated osteoclasts formation, reduced CTSK gene expression and had little effect on c-Fos and NFATc1 gene expression. Concerning bone resorption activity, RANKL treatment increased bone resorption pits on bovine bone slices. Significantly higher levels of osteoclastogenesis were observed with RAW264.7-cell density of 2×104 cells/well in 24-well plates. Our results suggest that the addition of 50 ng/ml M-CSF has no positive effect on osteoclastogenesis. RANKL treatment and cell density contribute to osteoclast formation, and the optimal conditions are beneficial when exploring osteoclast function and mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W4309218366,"The UK Biobank genotyped about 500k participants using Applied Biosystems Axiom microarrays. Participants were subsequently sequenced by the UK Biobank Exome Sequencing Consortium. Axiom genotyping was highly accurate in comparison to sequencing results, for almost 100,000 variants both directly genotyped on the UK Biobank Axiom array and via whole exome sequencing. However, in a study using the exome sequencing results of the first 50k individuals as reference (truth), it was observed that the positive predictive value (PPV) decreased along with the number of heterozygous array calls per variant. We developed a novel addition to the genotyping algorithm, Rare Heterozygous Adjusted (RHA), to significantly improve PPV in variants with minor allele frequency below 0.01%. The improvement in PPV was roughly equal when comparing to the exome sequencing of 50k individuals, or to the more recent ~200k individuals. Sensitivity was higher in the 200k data. The improved calling algorithm, along with enhanced quality control of array probesets, significantly improved the positive predictive value and the sensitivity of array data, making it suitable for the detection of ultra-rare variants."

Understanding the factors which contribute to career success for clinical academics is critical for supporting this workforce. Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) provides a conceptual framework for career success, incorporating personal and environmental factors.The aim of this study is to explore clinical academics' construal of successful clinical academic practice and to contribute to a holistic view of the professional identity of the clinical academic.Using a constructivist technique, repertory grid, the authors interviewed ten clinical academics at different career stages in one-to-one structured interviews conducted virtually between November 2020 and April 2021. Data from the interviews were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. Common themes were identified, analysed, and ranked according to importance with respect to successful clinical academic practice. Using SCCT as a framework, constructs were categorised as personal factors, organisational factors, competencies and person-environment fit. A differential analysis between established/trainee and female/male participants was carried out.One hundred and thirty-three constructs were elicited and categorised into 20 themes (constructs). There was consensus among participants that 6 were of high importance with respect to successful clinical academic practice, 8 of intermediate and 4 of low importance, with no consensus on 2 constructs. Personal factors of high importance include innovation and integrity. Competencies including research and teaching skills are highly important, and ability to collaborate is also considered central to successful clinical academic practice. Female participants expressed greater concerns about the impact of familial responsibilities on career progression.This study highlights the importance of interactions between the person and environment, and characterises the important attributes of successful clinical academics including personal factors such as integrity and innovation."
https://openalex.org/W4309263960,"We present a phylogeographic study of the tree species Eucalyptus baueriana Schauer, which occurs in disjunct areas on the near coastal plains and ranges of the south-east Australian mainland. DArTseq data are used to build a phylogeny including E . baueriana and closely related taxa to test its monophyly, test the genetic distinctness of the three subspecies of E . baueriana , and investigate relationships between its disjunct populations. Additionally, we use population structure analysis to investigate the genetic distinctness of populations, and MaxEnt to investigate the environmental factors potentially influencing the species’ distribution. We show E . baueriana is monophyletic and most closely related to three other Blue Box eucalypt species: E . conica H.Deane &amp; Maiden, E . dalveenica T.L.Collins, R.L.Andrew &amp; J.J.Bruhl and E . magnificata L.A.S.Johnson &amp; K.D.Hill, with some evidence for genetic introgression between these taxa. Within E . baueriana , the deepest genetic breaks do not correspond with the subspecies classification as the two geographically restricted subspecies, together with samples of the more widespread E . baueriana subsp. baueriana from west of the Gippsland lowlands, form a south-western clade with that is sister to other populations of subsp. baueriana . The oldest genetic break in the species occurs in far eastern Gippsland (Victoria), corresponding to one of the shortest geographic disjunctions in the species’ distribution. Genetic breaks in other species have been observed in this region which is broadly referred to as the southern transition zone. Both total annual rainfall and the seasonality of this rainfall are hypothesised to affect the species’ distribution; gaps in its distribution are in areas of higher rainfall that support closed forest and in regions with more winter dominated rainfall."

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections and to identify their determinants among students and staff during February to June in the academic year 2020–2021. We performed two complementary studies, a cross-sectional and a longitudinal component, using a questionnaire to collect nominal data and testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We describe the results and perform a univariate and multivariate analysis. The initial crude seroprevalence was 14.8% (95% CI: 13.1–16.5) and 22% (95% CI: 18.3–25.8) for students and staff respectively, and the active infection prevalence was 0.7% (95% CI: 0.3–1) and 1.1% (95% CI: 0.1–2). The overall incidence for persons at risk was 2.73 per 100 person-month and 2.89 and 2.34 per 100 person-month for students and staff, respectively. Socioeconomic, self-reported knowledge, risk perceptions and contact pattern variables were positively associated with the outcome while sanitary measure compliance was negatively associated, the same significance trend was observed in multivariate analysis. In the longitudinal component, epidemiological close contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection was a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection while the highest socioeconomic status level was protective as was compliance with sanitary measures. The small number of active cases detected in these schools suggests a low transmission among children in school and the efficacy of public health measures implemented, at least in the epidemiological scenario of the study period. The major contribution of this study was to provide results and evidence that help analyze the transmission dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 and evaluate the associations between sanitary protocols implemented, and measures to avoid SARS-CoV-2 spread in schools."
https://openalex.org/W4309264101,"The COVID-19 pandemic elicited a substantial hike in journal submissions and a global push to get medical evidence quickly through the review process. Editorial decisions and peer-assessments were made under intensified time constraints, which may have amplified social disparities in the outcomes of peer-reviewing, especially for COVID-19 related research. This study quantifies the differential impact of the pandemic on the duration of the peer-review process for women and men and for scientists at different strata of the institutional-prestige hierarchy. Using mixed-effects regression models with observations clustered at the journal level, we analysed newly available data on the submission and acceptance dates of 78,085 medical research articles published in 2019 and 2020. We found that institution-related disparities in the average time from manuscript submission to acceptance increased marginally in 2020, although half of the observed change was driven by speedy reviews of COVID-19 research. For COVID-19 papers, we found more substantial institution-related disparities in review times in favour of authors from highly-ranked institutions. Descriptive survival plots also indicated that scientists with prestigious affiliations benefitted more from fast-track peer reviewing than did colleagues from less reputed institutions. This difference was more pronounced for journals with a single-blind review procedure compared to journals with a double-blind review procedure. Gender-related changes in the duration of the peer-review process were small and inconsistent, although we observed a minor difference in the average review time of COVID-19 papers first authored by women and men."
https://openalex.org/W4309264127,"Various cueing strategies (internal and external) have been used to alleviate gait deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it remains unclear which type of cueing strategy is most effective at different disease stages or with more severe walking impairment, such as freezing of gait (FOG). The underlying neural mechanisms of response to cueing are also unknown. This trial aims to: (i) determine brain activity response to cue stimulus (internal, visual, auditory or tactile) when walking in PD and; (ii) examine changes in brain activity to cues at different stages of PD. This ongoing single-site study uses an exploratory observational design, with laboratory application of cues for gait deficit. A total of 80 people with PD who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled. Participants are split into groups dependent on their disease stage (classified with the Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) scale); n = 20 H&amp;YI; n = 30 H&amp;YII; n = 30 H&amp;YIII. Within the H&amp;Y stage II and III groups, we will also ensure recruitment of a sub-group of 15 individuals with FOG within each group. Participants perform walking tasks under several conditions: baseline walking without cues; randomized cued walking conditions [internal and external (visual, auditory and tactile) cues]. A combined functional near-infrared spectroscopy and electroencephalography system quantifies cortical brain activity while walking. Inertial sensors are used to assess gait. Primary outcome measures are cue-related changes in cortical brain activity while walking, including the relative change in cortical HbO2 and the power spectral densities at alpha (8-13Hz), beta (13-30Hz), delta (0.5-4Hz), theta (4-8Hz) and gamma (30-40Hz) frequency bandwidths. Secondary outcome measures are cue-related changes in spatiotemporal gait characteristics. Findings will enhance our understanding about the cortical responses to different cueing strategies and how they are influenced by PD progression and FOG status.

https://openalex.org/W4309218264,"Purpose Brain perfusion imaging is of enormous importance for various neurological diseases. Fast gradient-echo sequences offering flow-related enhancement (FREE) could present a basis to generate perfusion-weighted maps. In this study, we obtained perfusion-weighted maps without contrast media by a previously described postprocessing algorithm from the field of functional lung MRI. At first, the perfusion signal was analyzed in fast low-angle shot (FLASH) and balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) sequences. Secondly, perfusion maps were compared to pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) MRI in a healthy cohort. Thirdly, the feasibility of the new technique was demonstrated in a small selected group of patients with metastases and acute stroke. Methods One participant was examined with bSSFP and FLASH sequences at 1.5T and 3T, different flip angles and slice thicknesses. Twenty-five volunteers had bSSFP imaging and pCASL MRI. Three patients with cerebral metastases and one with acute ischemic stroke had bSSFP imaging and were compared to T1 post-contrast images and CT perfusion. Frequency analyses, SNR and perfusion contrast were compared at different flip angles and slice thicknesses. Regional correlations and Sorensen-Dice overlap were calculated in the healthy cohort. Dice overlap of the pathologies in the patient cohort were calculated. Results The bSSFP sequence presented detectable perfusion signal within brain vessel and parenchyma together with superior SNR compared to FLASH. Perfusion contrast and its corticomedullary differentiation increased with flip angle. Mean regional correlation was 0.36 and highly significant between FREE maps and pCASL and grey and white matter Dice match were 72% and 60% in the healthy cohort. Pathologies presented good overlap between FREE perfusion-weighted and T1 post-contrast images. Conclusion The feasibility of FREE brain perfusion imaging has been shown in a healthy cohort and selected patient cases with brain metastases and acute stroke. The study demonstrates a new approach for non-contrast brain perfusion imaging."
https://openalex.org/W4309218792,"Background Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder which induces endothelial dysfunction and platelet activation. Eicosanoids produced from arachidonic acid regulate cellular and vascular functions. Sigma-1 receptors (S1R) are expressed in platelets and endothelial cells and S1R expression is protective in diabetes. Objectives Our aim was to examine the influence of sub-chronic, in vivo administered S1R ligands PRE-084, (S) -L1 (a new compound) and NE-100 on the ex vivo arachidonic acid metabolism of platelets and aorta in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Methods The serum level of the S1R ligands was detected by LC-MS/MS before the ex vivo analysis. Sigma-1 receptor and cyclooxygenase gene expression in platelets were determined by RT-qPCR. The eicosanoid synthesis was examined with a radiolabelled arachidonic acid substrate and ELISA. Results One month after the onset of STZ-induced diabetes, in vehicle-treated, diabetic rat platelet TxB 2 and aortic 6-k-PGF 1α production dropped. Sub-chronic in vivo treatment of STZ-induced diabetes in rats for one week with PRE-084 enhanced vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregator and reduced vasodilator and anti-aggregator cyclooxygenase product formation. (S) -L1 reduced the synthesis of vasodilator and anti-aggregator cyclooxygenase metabolites and promoted the recovery of physiological platelet function in diabetic rats. The S1R antagonist NE-100 produced no significant changes in platelet arachidonic acid metabolism. (S) -L1 decreased the synthesis of vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregator cyclooxygenase metabolites, whereas NE-100 increased the quantity of aortic vasodilator and anti-aggregator cyclooxygenase products and promoted the recovery of diabetic endothelial dysfunction in the aorta. The novel S1R ligand, (S) -L1 had similar effects on eicosanoid synthesis in platelets as the agonist PRE-084 and in aortas as the antagonist NE-100. Conclusions S1R ligands regulate cellular functions and local blood circulation by influencing arachidonic acid metabolism. In diabetes mellitus, the cell-specific effects of S1R ligands have a compensatory role and aid in restoring physiological balance between the platelet and vessel."
https://openalex.org/W4309232028,"Performance on auditory change detection tasks can be improved by training. We examined the stimulus specificity of these training effects in behavior and ERPs. A flicker change detection task was employed in which spatialized auditory scenes were alternated until a ""change"" or ""same"" response was made. For half of the trials, scenes were identical. The other half contained changes in the spatial locations of objects from scene to scene. On Day 1, participants were either trained on this auditory change detection task (trained group), or trained on a non-auditory change detection task (control group). On Day 2, all participants were tested on the flicker task while EEG was recorded. The trained group showed greater change detection accuracy than the control group. They were less biased to respond ""same"" and showed full generalization of learning from trained to novel auditory objects. ERPs for ""change"" compared to ""same"" trials showed more negative going P1, N1, and P2 amplitudes, as well as a larger P3b amplitude. The P3b amplitude also differed between the trained and control group, with larger amplitudes for the trained group. Analysis of ERPs to scenes viewed prior to a decision revealed build-up of a difference between ""change"" and ""same"" trials in N1 and P2. Results demonstrate that training has an impact early in the ""same"" versus ""change"" decision-making process, and that the flicker paradigm combined with the ERP method can be used to study the build-up of change detection in auditory scenes."
https://openalex.org/W4309232214,"Objectives Respiratory tract infection (RTI) incidence varies between people, but little is known about why. The aim of this study is therefore to identify risk factors for acquiring RTIs. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of 16,908 participants in the PRIMIT study, a pre-pandemic randomised trial showing handwashing reduced incidence of RTIs in the community. Data was analysed using multivariable logistic regression analyses of self-reported RTI acquisition. Results After controlling for handwashing, RTI in the previous year (1 to 2 RTIs: adjusted OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.13, p&lt;0.001; 3 to 5 RTIs: aOR 3.89, 95% CI 3.49 to 4.33, p&lt;0.001; ≥6 RTIs: OR 5.52, 95% CI 4.37 to 6.97, p&lt;0.001); skin conditions that prevent handwashing (aOR 1.39, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.55, p&lt;0.001); children under 16 years in the household (aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.12, 1.43, p&lt;0.001); chronic lung condition (aOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.32, p = 0.026); female sex (aOR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.18, p = 0.005), and post-secondary education (aOR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17, p = 0.01) increased the likelihood of RTI. Those over the age of 65 years were less likely to develop an infection (aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97, p = 0.009). Household crowding and influenza vaccination do not influence RTI acquisition. A post-hoc exploratory analysis found no evidence these subgroups differentially benefited from handwashing. Conclusions Previous RTIs, chronic lung conditions, skin conditions that prevent handwashing, and the presence of household children predispose to RTI acquisition. Further research is needed to understand how host and microbial factors explain the relationship between previous and future RTIs."
https://openalex.org/W4309232433,"The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of selective immunoglobulin A deficiency (SIgAD) among children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) in Ternopil region (western Ukraine). Serum IgA levels were measured in 240 patients aged 4–17 years with DM and in 324 children of a control group of the same age. Normal IgA level was observed in 210 (87.5%) patients, increased—in 18 (7.5%), decreased (lower than the age reference value)—in 12 (5.0%) patients with DM. The mean IgA level in patients with DM was 152.11±73.78 mg/dL. SIgAD criteria were met by 7 (2.9%) children with DM, but none of the children of the control group met the SIgAD criteria. Female / male ratio among the patients with SIgAD was 1/6. There was no history of recurrent infections in these patients. No correlation between IgA and HbA1c levels was detected. Autoimmune thyroiditis was observed in 42.9% of patients with DM and SIgAD, and in 3.5% of patients with DM and normal or increased IgA levels. Thus, the prevalence of selective IgA deficiency in children with DM in Ternopil region (Ukraine) is 2.9% (1:34). This study shows that patients with low IgA levels need further re-examination of IgA levels to exclude SIgAD. Children with SIgAD and DM should be monitored for autoimmune manifestations that may affect the course and consequences of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W4309232450,"We investigate liquidity spillovers among industry sectors in the S&P 500 index to explain the interconnection dynamics in the US stock market. To do so, we define a sectoral liquidity measure based on the Amihud liquidity measure. Employing the spillover model, we further examine US sectors' liquidity spillovers during the global financial crisis (GFC) and the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the relationship between liquidity in financial markets and business cycles, our findings show that (i) liquidity connections became stronger during both crises, (ii) in the GFC period, the material sector was the primary transmitter of total liquidity spillovers, whereas in the COVID-19 pandemic period, the consumer discretionary sector was the main conveyor of total liquidity spillovers and the real estate sector was the dominant recipient of total liquidity spillovers, and (iii) net liquidity spillovers between all sectors fluctuated notably during the GFC, while the industrial, consumer staples, and healthcare sectors had the largest net liquidity spillovers during the COVID-19 crisis. These findings have important implications for portfolio managers and policymakers."

https://openalex.org/W4309263866,"Background Infant sunlight exposure in their early infancy is essential for the cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent due to inadequate exposure to sunlight. In Ethiopia, one in thirteen children had rickets, which could be prevented by sunlight exposure or supplementation. This study aimed to identify the practice of infants’ sunlight exposure and associated factors among mothers attending the Expanded program immunization unit of Wolkite University Specialized Hospital. Method This study employed an institutional-based cross-sectional study design to collect data. Data were collected from 220 mothers using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The study employed a systematic random sampling technique to reach the study participants. The collected data were entered into a computer using the software Epidata 3.1 version and exported to SPSS version 23 for statistical analysis. Descriptive and inferential analysis was conducted. Logistic regression analysis was done, and a statistical association was declared at a p-value &lt; 5% and a 95% confidence interval(CI). Then the results were presented using a frequency table, figures, and description. Result A total of 220 infant-coupled mothers who visited the Expanded program immunization unit were included in the study. According to the current study, 67.3% of mothers had good practice with infants’ sunlight exposure. Mothers’ practice of infant sunlight exposure was affected by age of mothers 30–34 years, [AOR = 3.10, 95%CI (1.13, 8.51)], and age ≥35 years, [AOR = 4.49, 95%CI (1.20, 16.86)], and living in urban, [AOR = 1.94, 95%CI (1.053, 3.57)]. Conclusion The current study showed that two-thirds (67.3%) of mothers had good practice of sunlight exposure to their infants. Factors that affect mothers’ practice of infants’ sunlight exposure are age and place of residence. Health professionals should provide health education for mothers on the benefits of infants’ sunlight exposure."
https://openalex.org/W4309263937,"We estimated the magnitude of the HIV epidemic among children and youth living with HIV (CYHIV) aged 0-25 years in Thailand, projecting forward from 2005 to 2025, and identified underreported input parameters that influence epidemic projections, in order to inform future public health and research priorities.We developed a focused multi-state transition model incorporating perinatally-acquired HIV and non-perinatally-acquired HIV, stratified by population, including men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSW), people who inject drugs (PWID), and the remainder of the population (""other""). We populated the model with published and programmatic data from the Thai national AIDS program when available. We projected the period from 2005-2025 and compared model results to programmatic data and projections from other models. In a scenario analysis, we projected the potential impact of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for MSM from 2018-2025.The initial 2005 cohort was comprised of 66,900 CYHIV; 8% CYHIV were &lt;5 years, 21% were 5-14 years, and 71% were 15-25 years of age. By 2020, 94% were projected to be &gt;15 years and infections among MSM constituted 83% of all new HIV infections. The numbers of CYHIV decreased over time, projected to reach 30,760 by 2020 (-54%) and 22,640 by 2025 (-66%). The proportion of all CYHIV aged 0-25 who were diagnosed and on ART increased from 37 to 60% over the 2005-2025 period. Projections were sensitive to variations in assumptions about initial HIV prevalence and incidence among MSM, PWID, and ""other"" youth.More data on incidence rates among sexual and gender minority youth and PWID are needed to characterize the role of specific exposures and key populations in the adolescent HIV epidemic. More accurate estimates will project shifts in population and inform more targeted interventions to prevent and care for Thai CYHIV."
https://openalex.org/W4309263972,"Throughout the world, wetlands have experienced degradation and declines in areal coverage. Fortunately, recognition of the value of wetlands has generated interest in preserving and restoring them. Post-restoration monitoring is necessary to analyze success or failure, thereby informing subsequent management decisions. Restoration of oxbow wetlands has become the focus of targeted restoration efforts to promote recovery of biodiversity and sensitive species, and to enhance ecosystem services. The fish communities of oxbows have been the subject of many monitoring studies. However, a recommended sampling methodology for monitoring the fish communities of oxbows has not been described, thereby limiting our capacity to effectively monitor these ecosystems. We compared four sampling methodologies (backpack electrofishing, fyke netting, minnow trapping, and seining) for fish community data collection with a primary objective of determining an effective method for sampling fish communities in small oxbow wetlands. Seining and fyke netting were determined to be effective methods for sampling oxbow fish communities. Backpack electrofishing and minnow trapping produced low taxonomic richness values and sampled a smaller proportion of species present than seining and fyke netting. Although seining and fyke netting produced similar taxonomic diversity and abundance values, these two gears differ in their ease of implementation and potential habitat disturbance generated by sampling. Therefore, consideration must be given to how species present (especially sensitive species) within the wetland could be impacted by sampling disturbance when choosing between seining and fyke netting."
https://openalex.org/W4309263984,"Cost collection using UB-04 forms for economic evaluation is challenging, as UB-04 collection is time and effort intensive and compliance is imperfect. Alternative data sources could overcome those challenges. The objective of this study is to determine the usefulness of UB-04 data in estimating hospital costs compared to clinical case report form (CRF) data. Health care utilization costs were compared from financial information in UB-04s and from an assignment process using CRF data, from the WRAP-IT (23 infections) and the Micra IDE trials (61 adverse events and 108 implants). Charge-based costs were calculated by multiplying charges in UB-04s and hospital-specific Cost-to-Charge ratios from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services cost reports. The cost assignment process used clinical information to find comparable encounters in real world data and assigned an average cost. Paired difference tests evaluated whether both methods yield similar results. The mean difference in total infection related costs between methods in the WRAP-IT trial was $152 +/-$22,565. In the Micra IDE trial, the mean difference in total adverse event related costs between methods was -$355 +/-$8,298 while the mean difference in total implant related costs between methods was $-3,488 +/-$13,859. Wilcoxon tests and generalized linear models could not reject the difference in costs between methods in the first two cases. Cost assignment methods achieve results similar to costs obtained through UB-04s, without the additional investment in time and effort. The use of UB-04 information for services that are not mature in a health care system may present unexpected challenges, necessitating a tradeoff with other methods of cost assignment."

The perceived quality of IT services is complex and is often measured by multi-dimensional constructs, which requires designing a sufficiently valid scale. Drawing upon literature and expert input, this study has identified 5 dimensions of IT service quality. Using an empirical study, we prove that perception of IT Service Quality (ITSQ) has a dimensional structure and can be measured using a 44-item scale which has been satisfactorily validated. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is applied to confirm the relationship between the items and dimensions. The findings of this study present a scale for measuring ITSQ within higher education."
https://openalex.org/W4309264055,"Brownfields are an important part of urban land resources. Strengthening the governance and redevelopment of brownfields is significant to environmental protection, high-quality urban development and sustainable development. However, due to the complexity and harmfulness of brownfield pollution, the hasty, untimely, and blind development can cause serious consequences. It is infeasible to pay more attention to development than governance or vice versa. In this paper, aiming at brownfield redevelopment evaluation, we introduced the Wuli-Shili-Renli (WSR) system methodology, an oriental system thought combining qualitative and quantitative analyses, comprehensively analyzed the influencing factors of brownfields from three dimensions of Wuli, Shili and Renli, and constructed the evaluation index system of brownfield redevelopment. To avoid much subjectivity in the evaluation process, we established the evaluation model of brownfield redevelopment using the catastrophe progression method. Taking the renovation project of Shanghai Xintiandi in 1999–2001 as a reference, the evaluation index system and evaluation model were applied to the renovation project of Wenjia Street in Qingyang District, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China in 2022, and the results provided a good basis for the decision-making process."
https://openalex.org/W4309264061,"Introduction Management of severe COVID-19 patients with persistent respiratory failure after acute phase treatment is not only challenging, but evidence for treatment is scarce, despite some authors reporting favourable clinical responses to corticosteroid therapy in histologically proven secondary organising pneumonia (OP). This study aimed to report the course of the disease, radiological pattern and clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients with persistent respiratory failure. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of severe COVID-19 patients who were admitted to a single tertiary centre from 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2021. The clinical data of the patients during admission and clinic follow-up, including radiological images, were traced using electronic medical records. Results In our cohort, the mortality rate for those with severe COVID-19 was 23.1% (173/749). Among the survivors, 46.2% (266/576) had persistent respiratory failure (PRF) after 14 days of illness. Of them, 70.3% (187/266) were followed up, and 68% (128/187) received oral corticosteroid (prednisolone) maintenance treatment. OP pattern made up the majority (81%) of the radiological pattern with a mean severity CT score of 10 (SD±3). The mean prednisolone dose was 0.68mg/kg/day with a mean treatment duration of 47 days (SD±18). About one-third of patients (67/187) had respiratory symptoms at 4 weeks (SD±3). Among 78.1% (146/187) who had a repeated CXR during follow-up, only 12 patients (8.2%, SD±3) had radiological improvement of less than 50% at 6 weeks (SD±3), with 2 of them later diagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis. Functional assessments, such as the 6-minute walk test and the spirometry, were only performed in 52.4% and 15.5% of the patients, respectively. Conclusion Almost half of the patients with severe COVID-19 had PRF, with a predominant radiological OP pattern. More than two-thirds of the PRF patients required prolonged oral corticosteroid treatment. Familiarising clinicians with the disease course, radiological patterns, and potential outcomes of this group of patients may better equip them to manage their patients."
https://openalex.org/W4309264153,"The term circa situm has been used to describe different conservation strategies within agricultural landscapes. Circa situm conserves planted or remnant species in farmlands, where natural vegetation has been modified through anthropogenic intervention. It has been proposed that trees planted or retained under circa situm conditions may contribute to maintaining genetic diversity, however information on the role of this strategy in preserving genetic diversity is scarce. The aim of this study was to determine the levels of genetic diversity and structure, and mating patterns in planted and unmanaged stands of the tropical fruit tree Spondias purpurea L. in north western Costa Rica. In three localities, we used seven polymorphic microsatellite loci and genotyped 201 adults and 648 seeds from planted and wild stands. We found no differences in genetic diversity among planted and wild stands. Genetic structure analysis revealed that gene flow occurs among planted and wild stands within localities. Clones were present and their diversity and evenness were both high and similar between planted and wild stands. The number of pollen donors per progeny array was low (N ep = 1.01) which resulted in high levels of correlated paternity (r p = 0.9). Asexual seeds were found in 4.6% of the progeny arrays, which had multilocus genotypes that were identical to the maternal trees. Our results show that although planted stands under circa situm conditions can maintain similar levels of genetic diversity than wild stands, the low number of sires and asexual seed formation could threaten the long term persistence of populations."
https://openalex.org/W4309264170,"Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is a urease-producing bacteria which is a major cause of magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) urolithiasis in canine. A positive urolith culture is an important risk factor for MAP urolithiasis in canine. The mechanism underlying the metabolic changes of S . pseudintermedius after crystallization in artificial urine (AU) needs more defined baseline metabolic information. Therefore, we extensively investigated the metabolic changes of S . pseudintermedius extensively after crystallization in AU. A high urease activity and positive biofilm formation strain, entitled the S . pseudintermedius (SPMAP09) strain, was isolated from canine MAP uroliths, and analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based metabolomics. The molecular mechanism-specific metabolic phenotypes were clearly observed after crystallization in AU at day 3. The crystals induced by SPMAP09 were also confirmed and the major chemical composition identified as struvite. Interestingly, our findings demonstrated that a total of 11 identified metabolites were significantly changed. The levels of formate, homocarnosine, tyrosine, cis-aconitate, glycolate, ethyl malonate, valine and acetate level were significantly higher, accompanied with decreased levels of inosine, glucose, and threonine at day 3 compared with the initial time-point (day 0). In addition, our results exhibited that the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism was significantly related to the SPMAP09 strain at day 3 in AU. Thus, metabolic changes of the SPMAP09 strain after crystallization in AU potentially helps to explain the preliminary molecular mechanism for the crystals induced by S . pseudintermedius ."
