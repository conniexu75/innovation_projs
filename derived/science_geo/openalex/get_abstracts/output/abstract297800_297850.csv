https://openalex.org/W1979552292,"In a central New Hampshire forest, three co-occurring tree species were found to occupy different positions on a reproductive strategy gradient. These reproductive strategy differences, in part, described separate niches for the species. The three-species complex is hypothesized to form a dynamic climax overstory characterized by cyclical replacement of one dominant species by another."

Trace elements at concentrations as low as 1 part per million can be detected. Some preliminary results based on the use of this simple method are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2054393601,"Considering the unique morphology (purposefully shaped polished bar with a groove) and composition (magnetic mineral with magnetic moment vector in the floating plane) of M-160, and acknowledging that the Olmec were a sophisticated people who possessed advanced knowledge and skill in working iron ore minerals, I would suggest for consideration that the Early Formative artifact M-160 was probably manufactured and used as what I have called a zeroth-order compass, if not a first-order compass. The data I have presented in this article support this hypothesis, although they are not sufficient to prove it. That M-160 could be used today as a geomagnetically directed pointer is undeniable. The original whole bar may indeed have pointed close to magnetic north-south. The groove functions well as a sighting mark, and the slight angle it makes with the axis of the bar appears to be the result of calibration rather than accident. A negative supporting argument is that M-160 looks utilitarian rather than decorative, and no function for the object other than that of a compass pointer has been suggested by anyone who has examined it critically. Whether such a pointer would have been used to point to something astronomical (zeroth-order compass) or to geomagnetic north-south (first-order compass) is entirely open to speculation."
https://openalex.org/W2136804653,The stress distribution on the lithospheric plate due to excess magma pressure is obtained from an exact solution of the three-dimensional theory of elasticity. The analysis indicates that rift valley formation and associated structural and geophysical characteristics can be suitably explained by dike-like intrusions of magma or igneous mush into the lithospheric plate.

(2) The administration of benzoic acid to a patient on an unrestricted diet Ilay double the penicillin blood level during similar treatment. (3) The combination of these two procedures results in a four- to eight-fold increase in penicillin blood level with a prolonged effective blood concentration."

The work demonstrates the feasibility and efficiency of the simplex design and suggests its application and usefulness in other syntheses."

https://openalex.org/W1986471109,"One hundred and fifty organisms, comprising bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes, were isolated from straw-compost, manure, soil, drainage material and soil enriched with virus concentrates, and were tested for antiviral activity in vitro. Three of these organisms gave indications of possible inactivation of some of the fowl pox virus, and, in one case, of the laryngotracheitis virus. The active principle of one of these organisms was actinomycin A, an antibacterial substance known to be highly toxic to animals. The other two organisms were less extensively studied, and no claims regarding their antiviral potentialities can be made at present."

https://openalex.org/W2076362611,"Flash heating of Illinois coal (to 700°C in 1 second) in flowing hydrogen at 100 atmospheres, limiting the vapor residence time at 700°C to 3 seconds, converts 14 percent of the coal's carbon to methane, 7 percent to ethane, and 10 percent to benzene, toluene, and xylenes. The remainder is coke; the carbon balance shows that heavy tar, if any exists, is less than 3 percent."
