https://openalex.org/W2157725602,"Swine Flu Benchmark The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on 29 April 2009, a level-5 pandemic alert for a strain of H1N1 influenza originating in pigs in Mexico and transmitting from human to human in several countries. Fraser et al. (p. 1557 , published online 11 May; see the cover) amassed a team of experts in Mexico and WHO to make an initial assessment of the outbreak with a view to guiding future policy. The outbreak appears to have originated in mid-February in the village of La Gloria, Veracruz, where over half the population suffered acute respiratory illness, affecting more than 61% of children under 15 years old in the community. The basic reproduction number (the number of people infected per patient) is in the range of 1.5—similar or less than that of the pandemics of 1918, 1957, and 1968. There remain significant uncertainties about the severity of this outbreak, which makes it difficult to compare the economic and societal costs of intervention with lives saved and the risks of generating antiviral resistance."

We have previously shown that the G protein–coupled receptor GPR30 (also known as GPER), in addition to classical nuclear estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ), activates cellular signaling pathways in response to estrogen. In order to distinguish between the actions of classical estrogen receptors and GPR30, we have previously characterized G-1 (1), a selective agonist of GPR30. To complement the pharmacological properties of G-1, we sought to identify an antagonist of GPR30 that displays similar selectivity against the classical estrogen receptors. Here we describe the identification and characterization of G15 (2), a G-1 analog that binds to GPR30 with high affinity and acts as an antagonist of estrogen signaling through GPR30. In vivo administration of G15 revealed that GPR30 contributes to both uterine and neurological responses initiated by estrogen. The identification of this antagonist will accelerate the evaluation of the roles of GPR30 in human physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2132076028,"The pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms involves inflammatory cell recruitment and increased levels of reactive oxygen species and matrix metalloproteases. Kimio Satoh et al. now mechanistically link the protein cyclophilin A—expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells—to these known mediators of aortic aneurysm formation and provide evidence in both mice and humans for the importance of cyclophilin A in aortic aneurysm formation. Inflammation and oxidative stress are pathogenic mediators of many diseases, but molecules that could be therapeutic targets remain elusive. Inflammation and matrix degradation in the vasculature are crucial for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation. Cyclophilin A (CypA, encoded by Ppia) is highly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), is secreted in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promotes inflammation. Using the angiotensin II (AngII)-induced AAA model in Apoe−/− mice, we show that Apoe−/−Ppia−/− mice are completely protected from AngII–induced AAA formation, in contrast to Apoe−/−Ppia+/+ mice. Apoe−/−Ppia−/− mice show decreased inflammatory cytokine expression, elastic lamina degradation and aortic expansion. These features were not altered by reconstitution of bone marrow cells from Ppia+/+ mice. Mechanistic studies showed that VSMC-derived intracellular and extracellular CypA are required for ROS generation and matrix metalloproteinase-2 activation. These data define a previously undescribed role for CypA in AAA formation and suggest CypA as a new target for treating cardiovascular disease."

https://openalex.org/W2016878687,"Recent changes to South Africa's prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) guidelines have raised hope that the national goal of reducing perinatal HIV transmission rates to less than 5% can be attained. While programmatic efforts to reach this target are underway, obtaining complete and accurate data from clinical sites to track progress presents a major challenge. We assessed the completeness and accuracy of routine PMTCT data submitted to the district health information system (DHIS) in three districts of Kwazulu-Natal province, South Africa.We surveyed the completeness and accuracy of data reported for six key PMTCT data elements between January and December 2007 from all 316 clinics and hospitals in three districts. Through visits to randomly selected sites, we reconstructed reports for the same six PMTCT data elements from clinic registers and assessed accuracy of the monthly reports previously submitted to the DHIS. Data elements were reported only 50.3% of the time and were ""accurate"" (i.e. within 10% of reconstructed values) 12.8% of the time. The data element ""Antenatal Clients Tested for HIV"" was the most accurate data element (i.e. consistent with the reconstructed value) 19.8% of the time, while ""HIV PCR testing of baby born to HIV positive mother"" was the least accurate with only 5.3% of clinics meeting the definition of accuracy.Data collected and reported in the public health system across three large, high HIV-prevalence Districts was neither complete nor accurate enough to track process performance or outcomes for PMTCT care. Systematic data evaluation can determine the magnitude of the data reporting failure and guide site-specific improvements in data management. Solutions are currently being developed and tested to improve data quality."
https://openalex.org/W2070018025,"Lipolysis is the catabolic pathway by which triglycerides are hydrolyzed into fatty acids. Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) have the capacity to hydrolyze in vitro the first ester bond of triglycerides, but their respective contributions to whole cell lipolysis in human adipocytes is unclear. Here, we have investigated the roles of HSL, ATGL, and its coactivator CGI-58 in basal and forskolin-stimulated lipolysis in a human white adipocyte model, the hMADS cells. The hMADS adipocytes express the various components of fatty acid metabolism and show lipolytic capacity similar to primary cultured adipocytes. We show that lipolysis and fatty acid esterification are tightly coupled except in conditions of stimulated lipolysis. Immunocytochemistry experiments revealed that acute forskolin treatment promotes HSL translocation from the cytosol to small lipid droplets and redistribution of ATGL from the cytosol and large lipid droplets to small lipid droplets, resulting in enriched colocalization of the two lipases. HSL or ATGL overexpression resulted in increased triglyceride-specific hydrolase capacity, but only ATGL overexpression increased whole cell lipolysis. HSL silencing had no effect on basal lipolysis and only partially reduced forskolin-stimulated lipolysis. Conversely, silencing of ATGL or CGI-58 significantly reduced basal lipolysis and essentially abolished forskolin-stimulated lipolysis. Altogether, these results suggest that ATGL/CGI-58 acts independently of HSL and precedes its action in the sequential hydrolysis of triglycerides in human hMADS adipocytes."

Determination of SirT1 function in tumor cells is important for its targeting in cancer therapy. We found that SirT1 knockdown by short hairpin RNA accelerates tumor xenograft formation by HCT116 cells, whereas SirT1 overexpression inhibits tumor formation. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of SirT1 stimulates cell proliferation under conditions of growth factor deprivation. Paradoxically, SirT1 inhibition also sensitizes cells to apoptosis by chemotherapy drugs. Immunohistochemical staining revealed high level SirT1 in normal colon mucosa and benign adenomas. SirT1 overexpression was observed in ∼25% of stage I/II/III colorectal adenocarcinomas but rarely found in advanced stage IV tumors. Furthermore, ∼30% of carcinomas showed lower than normal SirT1 expression. This pattern is consistent with SirT1 having pleiotropic effects during cancer development (anti-proliferation and anti-apoptotic). These results suggest a rationale for the use of SirT1 activators and inhibitors in the prevention and treatment of colon cancer.

Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar). Increased Sir2 gene dosage results in the extension of life span in yeast (2.Guarante L.P. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1055: 222Crossref Google Scholar). Sir2 is activated by multiple stress signals such as starvation, osmotic stress, and heat shock. In both yeast and C elegans, caloric restriction-induced life span extension is dependent on Sir2 (3.Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L.

Therefore, Sir2 is a key regulator of cellular homeostasis and survival by connecting stress signals to regulation of gene expression in invertebrate organisms.In addition to its role in extending the lifespan of lower organisms under stressful conditions, mammalian homolog of Sir2 (SirT1) has been shown to regulate glucose homeostasis in mice by deacetylating and activating the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (5.Rodgers J.T.

More recently, a potent activator of SirT1 has shown therapeutic potential in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in animal models by improving insulin sensitivity and lowering plasma glucose level (11.Milne J.C.

In general, transient knockdown of SirT1 leads to increased apoptotic response to DNA damage or oxidative stress treatments. SirT1 deacetylates and inhibits the activities of p53, NF-κB, Forkhead, Ku, and E2F1 that are critical factors in stress response and apoptosis regulation (12.Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D.

The tumor suppressor HIC1 has also been shown to inhibit SirT1 expression by forming a repressive complex with SirT1 on its own promoter and sensitizing p53 response to DNA damage (18.Chen W.Y.

SirT1 also promotes cell survival by regulating the DNA damage signaling pathway via deacetylation of NBS1 (19.Yuan Z. Zhang X. Sengupta N. Lane W.S. Seto E. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 149-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Treatment with small molecule SirT1 inhibitors such as sirtinol, splitomycin, and cambinol induces growth arrest, senescence, or apoptosis in tumor cells (20.Heltweg B. Gatbonton T. Schuler A.D.

However, it is difficult to rule out off-target effects due to the limited potency and specificity of these compounds. Nonetheless, these findings suggest a rationale for inhibiting SirT1 as a therapeutic strategy for cancer.Interestingly, several studies suggest that SirT1 may act as a tumor suppressor. MEFs derived from SirT1-null mice are prone to spontaneous immortalization, suggesting that SirT1 behaves as a growth-suppressive gene in culture (22.Chua K.F. Mostoslavsky R. Lombard D.B. Pang W.W.

Furthermore, hematopoietic stem cells from SirT1-null mice have increased proliferation potential, and shRNA knockdown of SirT1 in human fibroblasts accelerates cell proliferation (23.Narala S.R. Allsopp R.C. Wells T.B. Zhang G. Prasad P. Coussens M.J. Rossi D.J. Weissman I.L. Vaziri H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1210-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24.Abdelmohsen K.

SirT1 has also been shown to inhibit androgen receptor-dependent cell proliferation in prostate tumor cells (25.Fu M. Liu M. Sauve A.A. Jiao X. Zhang X. Wu X. Powell M.J. Yang T. Gu W. Avantaggiati M.L. Pattabiraman N. Pestell T.G. Wang F. Quong A.A. Wang C. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 8122-8135Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Recent publications also showed that transgenic overexpression of SirT1 in the intestine inhibited polyp formation in the ApcMin mice (26.Firestein R. Blander G. Michan S. Oberdoerffer P. Ogino S. Campbell J. Bhimavarapu A. Luikenhuis S. de Cabo R. Fuchs C. Hahn W.C. Guarente L.P. Sinclair D.A. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), whereas SirT1 deficiency led to increased tumor formation in p53-null mice (27.Wang R.H. Sengupta K. Li C. Kim H.S. Cao L. Xiao C. Kim S. Xu X. Zheng Y. Chilton B. Jia R. Zheng Z.M. Appella E. Wang X.W. Ried T. Deng C.X. Cancer Cell. 2008; 14: 312-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that SirT1 may suppress tumor growth under certain conditions, and that SirT1 activators could be used for cancer treatment or prevention (28.Saunders L.R. Verdin E. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5489-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar).In this report, we show that SirT1 inhibition in human colon tumor cells promotes tumor xenograft formation in nude mice, whereas SirT1 overexpression inhibits tumor formation. Furthermore, SirT1 inhibition promotes cell proliferation in culture under conditions of growth factor deprivation but sensitizes the same cells to chemotherapy drugs. We show that SirT1 is expressed at high levels in normal colon epithelial cells and in pre-malignant adenomas, but its expression is reduced in a subset of malignant colon carcinomas. Furthermore, SirT1 overexpression is rarely observed in advanced Stage IV tumors. These results suggest that SirT1 may function as a tumor suppressor during certain stages of tumor development, but may also promote chemo-resistance upon treatment with DNA-damaging drugs.DiscussionThe results described above show that SirT1 has properties of a growth suppressor. Experiments using cell lines suggest that endogenous SirT1 in colon tumor cells limits proliferation in culture and inhibits tumor xenograft formation. Knockdown of SirT1 increases the rate of tumor growth, whereas overexpression of SirT1 reduces tumor formation in nude mice. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of SirT1 increases the rate of cell proliferation in culture. These results together suggest that SirT1 has properties of a context-dependent tumor suppressor.Our results lend further support to an emerging and unexpected tumor-suppressive function of SirT1. SirT1 has well established anti-apoptotic activity and is presumed to act as an oncogene. However, a recent study showed that transgenic mice overexpressing SirT1 in the intestine reduced the development of neoplasia caused by ApcMin mutation (26.Firestein R. Blander G. Michan S. Oberdoerffer P. Ogino S. Campbell J. Bhimavarapu A. Luikenhuis S. de Cabo R. Fuchs C. Hahn W.C. Guarente L.P. Sinclair D.A. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). SirT1+/− mice showed increased tumor incidence when crossed to a p53+/− background (27.Wang R.H. Sengupta K. Li C. Kim H.S. Cao L. Xiao C. Kim S. Xu X. Zheng Y. Chilton B. Jia R. Zheng Z.M. Appella E. Wang X.W. Ried T. Deng C.X. Cancer Cell. 2008; 14: 312-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). MEFs derived from SirT1-null mice undergo spontaneous immortalization with higher frequency, which is a classic phenotype of a tumor suppressor (22.Chua K.F. Mostoslavsky R. Lombard D.B. Pang W.W.

Therefore, different genetic models strongly suggest that SirT1 has properties of an atypical tumor suppressor.It is noteworthy that our results appear to contradict those of the anti-apoptotic function of SirT1. Several publications reported tumor cell apoptosis or growth arrest after transient knockdown of SirT1 or treatment with SirT1 inhibitors such as sirtinol, splitomycin, and cambinol (20.Heltweg B. Gatbonton T. Schuler A.D. Posakony J. Li H. Goehle S. Kollipara R. Depinho R.A. Gu Y. Simon J.A. Bedalov A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4368-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 21.Ota H.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10457-10463Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, these discrepancies can be reconciled if one takes into consideration that SirT1 inhibition sensitizes cells to apoptosis by stress. Therefore, tumor cells treated with SirT1 siRNA may undergo apoptosis due to additional transfection-associated stress. The off-target toxicity of the first-generation small molecule SirT1 inhibitors may also be responsible for the cell death or growth arrest responses. In fact, recent development of the nanomolar SirT1 inhibitor EX-527 demonstrated that specific inhibition of SirT1 alone does not cause apoptosis in tumor cell lines (29.Solomon J.M. Pasupuleti R. Xu L. McDonagh T. Curtis R. DiStefano P.S. Huber L.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar).Several studies suggested that SirT1 may act as an oncogene based on the detection of high levels of SirT1 in certain tumors (34.Huffman D.M. Grizzle W.E. Bamman M.M. Kim J.S. Eltoum I.A. Elgavish A. Nagy T.R. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6612-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 35.Hida Y. Kubo Y. Murao K. Arase S. Arch. Dermatol.

J. 2007; 2: 1360-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Here, our analysis of the SirT1 expression profile in colon cancer suggests that SirT1 is both overexpressed and down-regulated in different subsets of tumors. Such a staining pattern can be interpreted as SirT1 having both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive properties. It is consistent with the pleiotropic effects of SirT1, i.e. anti-apoptotic and growth suppressive depending on cellular context. A subset of tumors may down-regulate SirT1 to obtain a proliferation advantage, whereas some may increase SirT1 expression to benefit from its anti-apoptotic function. However, interpretation of the tumor staining results is subjective and should not be taken as definitive evidence. Further examination of a large patient cohort is needed to determine the association between SirT1 expression and clinical parameters such as survival and treatment response.Although the mechanism by which SirT1 inhibits cell proliferation remains to be further investigated, our previous study and this report suggest that inhibition of E2F1 is partly responsible. SirT1 interacts with E2F1, inhibits E2F1 acetylation, and is recruited by E2F1 to target promoters (16.Wang C. Chen L. Hou X. Li Z. Kabra N. Ma Y. Nemoto S. Finkel T. Gu W. Cress W.D. Chen J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). When expressed at high levels, SirT1 is a potent inducer of G1 arrest. Our results show that inhibition of SirT1 results in pRb hyper-phosphorylation. This may be an indirect result of E2F1 activation, which can induce cyclinD/cdk4 activity and promote pRb phosphorylation. It may also be a direct effect, because SirT1 interacts with pRb (37.Wong S. Weber J.D. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).In summary, our results suggest that both activators and inhibitors of SirT1 have therapeutic potential as anti-tumor agents. A simple scenario is that SirT1 activators may impart cancer prevention effects by enhancing the growth-inhibitory effect of SirT1 in benign tumors. Its effect on advanced stage tumors may be heterogeneous, depending on whether a tumor has evolved to rely on SirT1 for survival. However, when tumors are being treated with chemotherapy, SirT1 inhibitors may be useful for enhancing apoptotic response. Further investigation of SirT1 expression and its association with patient survival and treatment response is critical for the application of SirT1-targeted drugs.

Transgenic mice overexpressing SirT1 in pancreatic β cells showed improved glucose tolerance and increased insulin secretion in response to glucose (6.Moynihan K.A. Grimm A.A. Plueger M.M.

Furthermore, pharmacological activators of SirT1 such as resveratrol can mimic the anti-aging effects of calorie restriction in lower organisms, reduce insulin resistance in mice fed with high fat diet, and prolong survival (8.Howitz K.T.

Puigserver P. Ingram D.K. de Cabo R. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2006; 444: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (3617) Google Scholar). More recently, a potent activator of SirT1 has shown therapeutic potential in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in animal models by improving insulin sensitivity and lowering plasma glucose level (11.Milne J.C. Lambert P.D. Schenk S. Carney D.P. Smith J.J. Gagne D.J. Jin L. Boss O. Perni R.B. Vu C.B. Bemis J.E. Xie R. Disch J.S. Ng P.Y. Nunes J.J. Lynch A.V. Yang H. Galonek H. Israelian K. Choy W.

Numerous studies have also suggested a role of SirT1 in tumorigenesis. In general, transient knockdown of SirT1 leads to increased apoptotic response to DNA damage or oxidative stress treatments. SirT1 deacetylates and inhibits the activities of p53, NF-κB, Forkhead, Ku, and E2F1 that are critical factors in stress response and apoptosis regulation (12.Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D.

Cell. 2001; 107: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor HIC1 has also been shown to inhibit SirT1 expression by forming a repressive complex with SirT1 on its own promoter and sensitizing p53 response to DNA damage (18.Chen W.Y. Wang D.H. Yen R.C. Luo J. Gu W. Baylin S.B. Cell. 2005; 123: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). SirT1 also promotes cell survival by regulating the DNA damage signaling pathway via deacetylation of NBS1 (19.Yuan Z. Zhang X. Sengupta N. Lane W.S. Seto E. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 149-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Treatment with small molecule SirT1 inhibitors such as sirtinol, splitomycin, and cambinol induces growth arrest, senescence, or apoptosis in tumor cells (20.Heltweg B. Gatbonton T. Schuler A.D. Posakony J. Li H. Goehle S. Kollipara R. Depinho R.A. Gu Y. Simon J.A. Bedalov A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4368-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 21.Ota H. Tokunaga E. Chang K. Hikasa M.

However, it is difficult to rule out off-target effects due to the limited potency and specificity of these compounds. Nonetheless, these findings suggest a rationale for inhibiting SirT1 as a therapeutic strategy for cancer. Interestingly, several studies suggest that SirT1 may act as a tumor suppressor. MEFs derived from SirT1-null mice are prone to spontaneous immortalization, suggesting that SirT1 behaves as a growth-suppressive gene in culture (22.Chua K.F. Mostoslavsky R. Lombard D.B. Pang W.W.

Furthermore, hematopoietic stem cells from SirT1-null mice have increased proliferation potential, and shRNA knockdown of SirT1 in human fibroblasts accelerates cell proliferation (23.Narala S.R. Allsopp R.C. Wells T.B. Zhang G. Prasad P. Coussens M.J. Rossi D.J. Weissman I.L. Vaziri H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1210-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24.Abdelmohsen K.

SirT1 has also been shown to inhibit androgen receptor-dependent cell proliferation in prostate tumor cells (25.Fu M. Liu M. Sauve A.A. Jiao X. Zhang X. Wu X. Powell M.J. Yang T. Gu W. Avantaggiati M.L. Pattabiraman N. Pestell T.G. Wang F. Quong A.A. Wang C. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 8122-8135Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Recent publications also showed that transgenic overexpression of SirT1 in the intestine inhibited polyp formation in the ApcMin mice (26.Firestein R. Blander G. Michan S. Oberdoerffer P. Ogino S. Campbell J. Bhimavarapu A. Luikenhuis S. de Cabo R. Fuchs C. Hahn W.C. Guarente L.P. Sinclair D.A. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), whereas SirT1 deficiency led to increased tumor formation in p53-null mice (27.Wang R.H. Sengupta K. Li C. Kim H.S. Cao L. Xiao C. Kim S. Xu X. Zheng Y. Chilton B. Jia R. Zheng Z.M. Appella E. Wang X.W. Ried T. Deng C.X. Cancer Cell. 2008; 14: 312-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that SirT1 may suppress tumor growth under certain conditions, and that SirT1 activators could be used for cancer treatment or prevention (28.Saunders L.R. Verdin E. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5489-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that SirT1 inhibition in human colon tumor cells promotes tumor xenograft formation in nude mice, whereas SirT1 overexpression inhibits tumor formation. Furthermore, SirT1 inhibition promotes cell proliferation in culture under conditions of growth factor deprivation but sensitizes the same cells to chemotherapy drugs. We show that SirT1 is expressed at high levels in normal colon epithelial cells and in pre-malignant adenomas, but its expression is reduced in a subset of malignant colon carcinomas. Furthermore, SirT1 overexpression is rarely observed in advanced Stage IV tumors. These results suggest that SirT1 may function as a tumor suppressor during certain stages of tumor development, but may also promote chemo-resistance upon treatment with DNA-damaging drugs. DiscussionThe results described above show that SirT1 has properties of a growth suppressor. Experiments using cell lines suggest that endogenous SirT1 in colon tumor cells limits proliferation in culture and inhibits tumor xenograft formation. Knockdown of SirT1 increases the rate of tumor growth, whereas overexpression of SirT1 reduces tumor formation in nude mice. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of SirT1 increases the rate of cell proliferation in culture. These results together suggest that SirT1 has properties of a context-dependent tumor suppressor.Our results lend further support to an emerging and unexpected tumor-suppressive function of SirT1. SirT1 has well established anti-apoptotic activity and is presumed to act as an oncogene. However, a recent study showed that transgenic mice overexpressing SirT1 in the intestine reduced the development of neoplasia caused by ApcMin mutation (26.Firestein R. Blander G. Michan S. Oberdoerffer P. Ogino S. Campbell J. Bhimavarapu A. Luikenhuis S. de Cabo R. Fuchs C. Hahn W.C. Guarente L.P. Sinclair D.A. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). SirT1+/− mice showed increased tumor incidence when crossed to a p53+/− background (27.Wang R.H. Sengupta K. Li C. Kim H.S. Cao L. Xiao C. Kim S. Xu X. Zheng Y. Chilton B. Jia R. Zheng Z.M. Appella E. Wang X.W. Ried T. Deng C.X. Cancer Cell. 2008; 14: 312-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). MEFs derived from SirT1-null mice undergo spontaneous immortalization with higher frequency, which is a classic phenotype of a tumor suppressor (22.Chua K.F. Mostoslavsky R. Lombard D.B. Pang W.W.

Therefore, different genetic models strongly suggest that SirT1 has properties of an atypical tumor suppressor.It is noteworthy that our results appear to contradict those of the anti-apoptotic function of SirT1. Several publications reported tumor cell apoptosis or growth arrest after transient knockdown of SirT1 or treatment with SirT1 inhibitors such as sirtinol, splitomycin, and cambinol (20.Heltweg B. Gatbonton T. Schuler A.D. Posakony J. Li H. Goehle S. Kollipara R. Depinho R.A. Gu Y. Simon J.A. Bedalov A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4368-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 21.Ota H.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10457-10463Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, these discrepancies can be reconciled if one takes into consideration that SirT1 inhibition sensitizes cells to apoptosis by stress. Therefore, tumor cells treated with SirT1 siRNA may undergo apoptosis due to additional transfection-associated stress. The off-target toxicity of the first-generation small molecule SirT1 inhibitors may also be responsible for the cell death or growth arrest responses. In fact, recent development of the nanomolar SirT1 inhibitor EX-527 demonstrated that specific inhibition of SirT1 alone does not cause apoptosis in tumor cell lines (29.Solomon J.M. Pasupuleti R. Xu L. McDonagh T. Curtis R. DiStefano P.S. Huber L.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar).Several studies suggested that SirT1 may act as an oncogene based on the detection of high levels of SirT1 in certain tumors (34.Huffman D.M. Grizzle W.E. Bamman M.M. Kim J.S. Eltoum I.A. Elgavish A. Nagy T.R. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6612-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 35.Hida Y. Kubo Y. Murao K. Arase S. Arch. Dermatol.

J. 2007; 2: 1360-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Here, our analysis of the SirT1 expression profile in colon cancer suggests that SirT1 is both overexpressed and down-regulated in different subsets of tumors. Such a staining pattern can be interpreted as SirT1 having both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive properties. It is consistent with the pleiotropic effects of SirT1, i.e. anti-apoptotic and growth suppressive depending on cellular context. A subset of tumors may down-regulate SirT1 to obtain a proliferation advantage, whereas some may increase SirT1 expression to benefit from its anti-apoptotic function. However, interpretation of the tumor staining results is subjective and should not be taken as definitive evidence. Further examination of a large patient cohort is needed to determine the association between SirT1 expression and clinical parameters such as survival and treatment response.Although the mechanism by which SirT1 inhibits cell proliferation remains to be further investigated, our previous study and this report suggest that inhibition of E2F1 is partly responsible. SirT1 interacts with E2F1, inhibits E2F1 acetylation, and is recruited by E2F1 to target promoters (16.Wang C. Chen L. Hou X. Li Z. Kabra N. Ma Y. Nemoto S. Finkel T. Gu W. Cress W.D. Chen J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). When expressed at high levels, SirT1 is a potent inducer of G1 arrest. Our results show that inhibition of SirT1 results in pRb hyper-phosphorylation. This may be an indirect result of E2F1 activation, which can induce cyclinD/cdk4 activity and promote pRb phosphorylation. It may also be a direct effect, because SirT1 interacts with pRb (37.Wong S. Weber J.D. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).In summary, our results suggest that both activators and inhibitors of SirT1 have therapeutic potential as anti-tumor agents. A simple scenario is that SirT1 activators may impart cancer prevention effects by enhancing the growth-inhibitory effect of SirT1 in benign tumors. Its effect on advanced stage tumors may be heterogeneous, depending on whether a tumor has evolved to rely on SirT1 for survival. However, when tumors are being treated with chemotherapy, SirT1 inhibitors may be useful for enhancing apoptotic response. Further investigation of SirT1 expression and its association with patient survival and treatment response is critical for the application of SirT1-targeted drugs.

Wheeler V.C. Vrbanac V. Lebel L.A. Teed A. Mysore J.S. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Persichetti F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed Rrs1 (regulator of ribosome synthesis), which was differentially detected in homozygous HdhQ111 mice at very early ages. By RT-qPCR, Rrs1 mRNA regulation was validated and found to fulfill the HD criteria of dominance, striatal specificity, and polyglutamine dependence (8.Fossale E. Wheeler V.C. Vrbanac V. Lebel L.A. Teed A. Mysore J.S. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Persichetti F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Most importantly, Rrs1 mRNA expression was found significantly increased in HD postmortem brains compared with age-matched controls indicating that the increase in gene expression is a consequence of mutant Huntingtin in the human disease (8.Fossale E. Wheeler V.C. Vrbanac V. Lebel L.A. Teed A. Mysore J.S. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Persichetti F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). So far Rrs1 has been studied only in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where it encodes for a nucleolar protein that is involved in the maturation, nuclear export, and assembly of ribosomes (9.Miyoshi K.

Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2580-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rrs1 was found to be central in inhibiting transcription of both rRNA and ribosomal protein genes in response to a secretory defect (12.Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because in yeast a regulatory network links membrane functionality with ribosome synthesis, these data may suggest that Rrs1 may be involved in sensing a flaw in the secretory pathway, including alterations of Golgi and ER (14.Mizuta K. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2493-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Loss of Huntingtin profoundly affects embryonic stem cells that display a plethora of cellular dysfunctions, including an abnormal ER and reduced Golgi-ER trafficking (15.Hilditch-Maguire P. Trettel F. Passani L.A. Auerbach A. Persichetti F. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2789-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Interestingly, STHdhQ111 striatal cell lines expressing full-length mutant Huntingtin present clear evidence of ER stress response (16.Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). This has been recently shown to also occur in yeast as well as in PC12 cells where the pathologically expanded polyglutamines (poly(Q)) trigger a drastic inhibition of ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) (17.Reijonen S. Putkonen N. Nørremølle A. Lindholm D. Korhonen L. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 950-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 18.Duennwald M.L. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3308-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These data have led to the hypothesis that ER stress may be involved in HD pathogenesis. Here we show that mammalian Rrs1, as well as its newly identified interactor 3D3/lyric, is localized to the ER and is involved in the ER stress response in neuronal cells. Furthermore, we show for the first time that ER stress is an early event in a genetically precise mouse model of HD, which precedes the formation of amyloid intranuclear or cytoplasmic inclusions. We then confirmed ER stress in HD postmortem brains. Striatal cell lines from wild-type (STHdhQ7/Q7) and homozygous Hdh (STHdhQ111/Q111) knock-in mice were cultured as described previously (16.Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). HEK 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Tunicamycin (Sigma) treatment (1 μm) was for 3–6-12 h. Transfection of expression plasmids was performed by calcium phosphate precipitation. Expression plasmids were as follows: mouse Rrs1 cDNA (full-length RIKEN clone 5330427D04) subcloned (BamHI-XhoI) into pcDNA3.0 vector; mouse 3D3/lyric cDNA (full-length RIKEN clone 4931440A01) subcloned (EcoRI-XhoI) into pcDNA3.0-HA vector. Proteins from striatal cells were extracted in Tris, pH 8.0, lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, transfected HEK 293T cells were lysed in Hepes, pH 7.6 buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100), supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 10 nm okadaic acid). Protein extracts (2 mg) were incubated with primary antibody (anti-HA) and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Washes were performed in Hepes, pH 7.6 buffer. For Western blot analysis, protein extracts were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence following incubation with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). A cDNA encoding for the N-terminal region of Rrs1 (nucleotides 83–664; GenBankTM accession number NM_021511) was isolated by RT-PCR from mouse striatum. The PCR product was cloned (BamHI-XhoI) into pGEX-4T-3 vector and expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in BL21 cells. Following purification and separation on a SDS-PAGE, the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein band was cut out from the gel and used for the generation of a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (BioSource International). The immune serum was called FUN for FUsion of N-terminal region of Rrs1. Purification of the immune serum was performed by affinity elution from GST-Rrs1 fusion protein immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane. Preimmune serum was obtained before the immunization protocol was initiated. Other primary antibodies were as follows: sheep anti-3D3/lyric (SS) (kindly provided by Dr. H. Sutherland, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK); rabbit anti-3D3/lyric (Zymed Laboratories Inc.); mouse anti-calnexin (Chemicon); mouse anti-fibrillarin 72B9 (kindly provided by Dr. R. Terns, University of Georgia, Athens); and mouse anti-nucleophosmin (Invitrogen). For immunostaining phosphate-buffered saline washed cells were treated as described previously (16.Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry was performed on 40 μm of free-floating coronal sections of 2% periodate/lysine/paraformaldehyde (PLP) perfused and post-fixed brain. For detection, sections were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline, 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 1% fish gelatin for 1 h at room temperature. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% fish gelatin, 0.1% Triton X-100. Incubation with primary antibodies was performed for 16 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies were Alexa-594 anti-rabbit and Alexa-488 anti-mouse (Invitrogen). Images were captured using Leica confocal microscope (TCS SP2). Generation, maintenance on a C57BL/6 background, and genotyping of HdhQ111 knock-in mice were performed as described (4.White J.K. Auerbach W. Duyao M.P. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Joyner A.L. MacDonald M.E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 19.Lloret A. Dragileva E. Teed A. Espinola J. Fossale E. Gillis T. Lopez E. Myers R.H. MacDonald M.E. Wheeler V.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Striata were dissected from mouse brains, snap-frozen on liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Control and HD postmortem brain tissues used in this study were described previously (8.Fossale E. Wheeler V.C. Vrbanac V. Lebel L.A. Teed A. Mysore J.S. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Persichetti F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Brains were collected by the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center, McLean Hospital (Belmont, MA), and used according to the guidelines of the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board for discarded human tissue. HD brains were assigned Vonsattel grade 3 pathology (3.Vonsattel J.P. Myers R.H. Stevens T.J. Ferrante R.J. Bird E.D. Richardson Jr., E.P. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1985; 44: 559-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar). Postmortem intervals were from 12 to 32 h for controls and from 8 to 30 h for HD brains. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, quantified by NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific), and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Single strand cDNA was obtained from 1 μg of DNase-treated RNA using iSCRIPT cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative PCRs were performed with an iCycler iQ instrument (Bio-Rad), using the iQ Custom Syber Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Each reaction was performed in duplicate. Cycle parameters were 3 min at 95 °C, 10 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 58 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for 40 cycles. Specificity of amplicon was determined by melt curve analysis and gel electrophoresis. Specific forward and reverse primers (supplemental Table 1) were designed using Beacon Design 5.0 software (Premier Biosoft International). Normalized expression values were calculated using β-actin as endogenous control. Yeast host was EGY48 (MATα, his3, trp1, ura3, 6LexAop-LEU2). The bait was full-length Rrs1 cDNA (RIKEN clone 5330427D04) fused to LexA DNA binding domain into pEG202. The bait was used to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library cloned into pJG4-5 vector. Approximately 2.2 × 104 transformants were screened. Positive interaction between bait and fish protein resulted in transcription of Leu2 and lacZ reporters (PJK103), thus allowing growth in the absence of leucine and blue staining on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) plates. Strength of interaction was evaluated by rate of growth and β-galactosidase staining. Two hundred positive blue colonies with potential stronger interaction were further analyzed; plasmid DNA was extracted and examined by restriction enzyme digestion. Unique cDNA plasmids (∼130) were then sequenced and blasted against the NCBI human nucleotide data base. Among them we isolated five independent clones encoding for 3D3/lyric. The interaction between Rrs1 and 3D3/lyric was further validated in yeast by co-transformation of the rescued plasmid and pEG202-Rrs1 in the original yeast strain containing the lacZ reporter plasmid. In addition, 3D3/lyric plasmid was co-transformed with an unrelated bait, pLexA-DJ-1, and with the empty LexA plasmid as control. Statistical analyses were Student's t test (Microsoft Excel software), choosing p < 0.05 as significant. Calculated means and standard deviations were plotted using the graph tool of Microsoft Excel. To generate reagents for studying Rrs1 in mammalian cells, we developed a rabbit polyclonal antiserum, named FUN, raised against the N-terminal region of the mouse Rrs1 protein. The affinity-purified and the crude immune sera were tested by Western blot for their ability to reveal endogenous or ectopically expressed Rrs1 in wild-type striatum-derived STHdhQ7/7 cells expressing endogenous 7-glutamine Huntingtin (16.Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). A band of ∼40 kDa, consistent with the predicted molecular weight of mouse Rrs1 protein, was detected both in untransfected and in transfected cells (Fig. 1A), proving that the reagent recognized both endogenous as well as overexpressed Rrs1 protein. Specificity was confirmed by the lack of signal with the corresponding preimmune serum. The intracellular localization of endogenous Rrs1 was studied in STHdhQ7/7 cells by immunofluorescence. Confocal analysis revealed a nucleolar distribution of Rrs1 protein, which was found to co-stain with fibrillarin, a marker of the dense fibrillar component (DFC) of the nucleolus (Fig. 1B, top panels). Surprisingly, Rrs1 staining was also observed in the cytoplasm, with a distribution pattern reminiscent of a protein that localizes to the ER. By immunofluorescence analysis, we confirmed that Rrs1 antibody decorates the ER compartment by co-staining with calnexin, an integral membrane protein of ER (Fig. 1B, bottom panels). A similar intracellular distribution pattern of Rrs1 was observed in mouse brain sections by co-staining with the nucleolar protein nucleophosmin and with the ER protein calnexin (Fig. 1C). Pre-absorption of FUN antiserum with Rrs1 fusion protein specifically eliminated Rrs1 signal in brain sections (data not shown), proving the specificity of detection of endogenous Rrs1. To gain a better understanding of the cellular function of Rrs1 in mammals, a small scale yeast two-hybrid screening was performed to identify Rrs1-binding proteins in human brain. Mouse full-length Rrs1 was used as bait to screen ∼2.2 × 104 transformants of a human fetal brain cDNA library. Selected primary transformants (∼200 positive clones) were characterized by restriction enzyme digestion and sequenced. Sequence blast in NCBI data base revealed, among others, five independent clones encoding for 3D3/lyric. 3D3/lyric, alternatively known as metadherin and astrocyte elevated gene-1, is a transmembrane protein that resides in the ER and in the nuclear envelope (20.Sutherland H.G. Lam Y.W. Briers S. Lamond A.I. Bickmore W.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21.Kang D.C. Su Z.Z. Sarkar D. Emdad L. Volsky D.J. Fisher P.B. Gene. 2005; 353: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) that also co-localizes with fibrillarin in the DFC of the nucleolus (20.Sutherland H.G. Lam Y.W. Briers S. Lamond A.I. Bickmore W.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For its dual subcellular localization, 3D3/lyric has been suggested to coordinate ER function with ribosome biosynthesis in response to ER stress (20.Sutherland H.G. Lam Y.W. Briers S. Lamond A.I. Bickmore W.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because Rrs1 has been shown to be involved in the very same regulatory pathway in yeast, we have then focused our attention on 3D3/lyric. The interaction between Rrs1 and 3D3/lyric was validated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with full-length Rrs1 and 3D3/lyric HA-tagged cDNAs or with Rrs1 and an empty vector as control. Protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and analyzed by Western blot with anti-Rrs1 antiserum. As shown in Fig. 2A, Rrs1 was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with 3D3/lyric. The subcellular distribution of 3D3/lyric in wild-type murine STHdhQ7/7 striatal cells was detected by immunofluorescence with anti-3D3/lyric antibody (SS), kindly provided by Dr. Sutherland (Fig. 2B). As shown previously in fibroblasts (20.Sutherland H.G. Lam Y.W. Briers S. Lamond A.I. Bickmore W.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), 3D3/lyric was observed both in the ER membrane and in the nucleoli of the striatum-derived cells. Importantly, double immunofluorescence showed that 3D3/lyric and Rrs1 had a similar subcellular distribution in STHdhQ7/7 cells (Fig. 2B). We next investigated whether these two genes are involved in the mammalian response to ER stress. STHdhQ7/7 striatal cells were treated at different times (3, 6, and 12 h) with tunicamycin, a well known inducer of ER stress. Total RNA was extracted, and expression of Rrs1 and 3D3/lyric was measured by RT-qPCR both in tunicamycin- and DMSO-treated cells as control. As markers of ER stress response, we monitored the expression of BiP, CHOP, and Herpud1 mRNAs. Although BiP and CHOP are considered the canonical markers for this biological event, the less studied Herpud1 was chosen for its interaction with the ERAD system, recently proved to be a target of poly(Q) dysfunction (18.Duennwald M.L. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3308-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, ER stress response markers were induced as expected. Interestingly, a significant progressive induction of Rrs1 mRNA levels was observed starting at the earliest time point (3 h) and throughout the entire experiment (12 h) (Fig. 3B), whereas a significant up-regulation of 3D3/lyric mRNA was reached only after 6 h of tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that Rrs1 and 3D3/lyric are, respectively, an immediate-early and a later target of the ER stress response in cultured mammalian striatal cells. The knowledge that Rrs1 and 3D3/lyric may be partners in different phases of the ER stress response suggests that elevated Rrs1 mRNA in the HdhQ111 striatum in vivo may represent an early response to a perturbation of the ER homeostasis triggered by mutant Huntingtin that entails Rrs1 and 3D3/lyric function. Therefore, we monitored in HdhQ111 knock-in mice whether ER stress-related mRNA expressions were altered at 15 weeks and 1 year of age. These ages predate and directly follow, respectively, the formation of N-terminal Huntingtin inclusions (19.Lloret A. Dragileva E. Teed A. Espinola J. Fossale E. Gillis T. Lopez E. Myers R.H. MacDonald M.E. Wheeler V.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Real time RT-PCR assays were performed for BiP, CHOP, and Herpud1 from single mouse striata at both ages. A significant up-regulation of the chaperones BiP (1.5-fold) and Herpud1 (1.2-fold) mRNAs was observed in HdhQ111 striata compared with wild-type at 15 weeks of age (Fig. 4A) and 1 year of age (1.3- and 1.2-fold, respectively) (Fig. 4B). Notably, no significant difference in the level of CHOP mRNA was detectable at either age (Fig. 4, A and B). As expected, Rrs1 mRNA was significantly increased in the mutant striatal tissue, compared with wild-type striatum, both at 15 weeks and at 1 year of age, confirming that Rrs1 mRNA level is elevated along with ER stress-related mRNAs (Fig. 4, C and D). Intriguingly, 3D3/lyric mRNA was not significantly changed at 15 weeks or at 1 year of age in HdhQ111 striatum (Fig. 4, C and D). This may suggest that the ER stress induced by endogenous mutant Huntingtin is relatively subtle failing to elevate CHOP and 3D3/lyric mRNAs. Thus, 1-year-old Hdh mice may still present an early ER stress phase that does not involve late response CHOP and 3D3/lyric induction (22.Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar, 23.Okada T. Yoshida H. Akazawa R. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Importantly, these data reveal for the first time that in a presymptomatic HD mouse model, mutant Huntingtin leads to persistent ER stress in striatal tissue, including altered expression of a subset of canonical ER stress genes. To determine whether increased expression of ER stress genes occurs in human, we measured BiP, CHOP, and Herpud1 mRNAs in parietal cortex of control and HD postmortem brains (Vonsattel grade 3 neuropathology). Real time RT-PCR carried out on these tissues proved a significant up-regulation of BiP, CHOP, and Herpud1 mRNAs in HD compared with control of 2.2-, 2.0-, and 2.1-fold, respectively, as shown in the scattergraphs of Fig. 5, A–C. We then performed quantitative RT-PCR analysis to measure Rrs1 and 3D3/lyric expression. As expected, Rrs1 mRNA levels were found increased in disease compared with normal samples of 2.2-fold (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, we observed a significant 1.7-fold up-regulation of 3D3/lyric mRNA expression in HD compared with control brain tissue (Fig. 5E). These results show that mutant Huntingtin induces the expression of ER stress genes in human brain. Moreover, in contrast to presymptomatic mouse striata, the late ER stress response marker CHOP and 3D3/lyric are increased in HD postmortem brains, suggesting a lifetime impact of mutant Huntingtin on the ER stress pathway. In eukaryotic cells, the ER is the primary organelle in the secretory pathway where proteins are synthesized, folded, and post-translationally modified prior to be delivered to other secretory compartments. In addition, the ER is also the place where intracellular Ca2+ is stored and where lipids and sterols are synthesized. The ER is very susceptible to perturbation of homeostasis that disrupts its functions. When a threshold of damage is reached, ER stress occurs, and a specific cellular response is triggered. Signals are then transduced from the ER to the cytoplasm and to the nucleus to induce the expression of genes encoding mediators of cell defense. This response changes the expression of specific chaperones, enhances degradation of misfolded proteins, and inhibits protein synthesis to decrease the load within the ER (24.Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggests that alteration of ER homeostasis plays an important role in the pathology of several protein-misfolding neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases (25.Lindholm D. Wootz H. Korhonen L. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Importantly, several lines of evidence connect the ER compartment with Huntingtin activities. The analysis of embryonic stem cells derived from Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4/5 knock-out mice has led to the initial observation that a functional Huntingtin is essential for ER structure and for a correct Golgi/ER trafficking (15.Hilditch-Maguire P. Trettel F. Passani L.A. Auerbach A. Persichetti F. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2789-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Huntingtin is indeed associated to the ER through a membrane targeting domain in the first 18 amino acids, and it may translocate to the nucleus in response to ER stress (26.Atwal R.S. Truant R. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A comparison of striatal cell lines from homozygous (STHdhQ111/Q111) mutant knock-in versus wild-type (STHdhQ7/Q7) mice identified ER dysfunction as one of the phenotypes triggered by full-length mutant Huntingtin, including an excess of ER membranes (16.Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). More recently, clear evidence of ER stress has been reported in yeast and in cell lines overexpressing N-terminal mutant Huntingtin fragments (17.Reijonen S. Putkonen N. Nørremølle A. Lindholm D. Korhonen L. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 950-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 18.Duennwald M.L. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3308-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Importantly, the presence of a toxic poly(Q) expansion in yeast and PC12 cells led to a specific and drastic defect in ERAD through the entrapment of essential ERAD components like Npl4, Ufd1, and p97 into poly(Q) aggregates (18.Duennwald M.L. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3308-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Here we show for the first time that ER stress is a very early event in HD pathogenesis in vivo because it is detected in the striatum of Hdh knock-in mice before the formation of visible aggregates. Furthermore, ER stress is persistent because it is present throughout the entire life span of the mouse. Then we showed for the first time that ER stress markers are elevated in postmortem brains of HD patients. This work stems from the observation that the increase of Rrs1 expression is a pre-symptomatic event in the HD neurodegenerative cascade that is maintained through the life of an HD mouse model and confirmed in postmortem brains of HD patients. Surprisingly, mammalian Rrs1 is localized both to the ER and to the nucleolus. By scanning Rrs1 primary sequence, two motifs for ER membrane retention are indeed found both at its N and C termini, XXRR (EGQR) and KKXX (GKRR), providing a potential molecular mechanism for its subcellular distribution. By yeast two-hybrid we identified 3D3/lyric as Rrs1 interactor that shares its dual subcellular localization in the ER and nucleolus. Its association to the ER is probably mediated by a transmembrane sequence. Here we unveiled that Rrs1 and 3D3/lyric are targets of ER stress in vitro although with a different temporal pattern; Rrs1 is first induced, and the 3D3/lyric increases at late time points. Under the hypothesis that Rrs1 induction in HD mice was a manifestation of an ER stress response, we monitored the temporal development of ER stress in presymptomatic HD mice as well as its presence in postmortem HD brain looking at the expression of Rrs1, 3D3/lyric, Bip, Herpud1, and CHOP. Although Bip is a well known marker of ER overload and dysfunction, Herpud1 is an essential ERAD component, and CHOP is a well known effector of cell death when cellular homeostatic response to ER stress becomes unsustainable (27.Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar). ER stress has been detected in HD mice as up-regulation of BiP and Herpud1 mRNAs at 15 weeks and at 1 year of age. Interestingly, CHOP mRNA levels remained unchanged. This may not be surprising considering the protective activities of both chaperones BiP and Herpud1. By contrast, increased expression of CHOP did not occur in a presymptomatic HD model because it may be associated later in the disease cascade with an irreversible cellular death through apoptosis due to inability to overcome ER stress. Lack of induction was also observed for 3D3/lyric, the expression of which seemed to be part of a late ER stress response in vitro. Importantly, all three ER stress markers as well as Rrs1 and 3D3/lyric were induced in human HD postmortem brains as cell death became prominent proving the relevance of ER stress in HD pathogenesis. Both Rrs1 and 3D3/lyric have been suggested to play a role in coordinating some ER activities with the nucleolus (20.Sutherland H.G. Lam Y.W. Briers S. Lamond A.I. Bickmore W.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For Rrs1 this function has actually been proved in yeast because it was identified as a protein required for the transcriptional repression of both ribosomal protein and rRNA genes in response to a secretory defect (12.Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14.Mizuta K. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2493-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In recent proteomic analysis of the nucleolus, molecules that were previously considered exclusively resident in the ER membrane were found in both compartments, such as the signal recognition particle 68 (SRP68) (28.Politz J.C. Yarovoi S. Kilroy S.M. Gowda K. Zwieb C. Pederson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The assembly of the pre-signal recognition particle actually seems to occur in the nucleolus before being targeted to the nuclear pores. The ER membranes are indeed contiguous with the nuclear envelope, and some invaginations of the nuclear membrane have been reported to come in close contact with the nucleolus (29.Fricker M. Hollinshead M. White N. Vaux D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of the nucleolar protein Nopp140 induces the formation of intranuclear endoplasmic reticulum membranes (30.Isaac C. Pollard J.W. Meier U.T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4253-4264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the relationship between the ER and the nucleolus seems to be more complex than supposed and worthy of future investigation. In the nucleolus Rrs1 and 3D3/lyric co-localize with fibrillarin that is a DFC marker. This subnucleolar compartment contains actively transcribing rDNA along with nascent rRNA, and it is the site of maturation of pre-rRNA transcripts. These data are in full agreement with Rrs1 expression and function in yeast, where it was found to be a component of the yeast ribosome and rRNA biosynthesis regulon, a co-regulated cluster of genes that function in various aspects of ribosome biosynthesis (31.Wade C. Shea K.A. Jensen R.V. McAlear M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8638-8650Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because dysregulation of ribosome synthesis has been previously reported in HD (16.Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 32.Wyttenbach A. Swartz J. Kita H. Thykjaer T. Carmichael J. Bradley J. Brown R. Maxwell M. Schapira A. Orntoft T.F. Kato K.

Genet. 2001; 10: 1829-1845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our data lead us to the hypothesis that Rrs1 and 3D3/lyric might function as an ER stress sensor in HD and participate in transducing these signals to the nucleolus. Further work is clearly needed to validate this hypothesis. We thank Dr. H Sutherland for 3D3/lyric (SS) antibody; Dr. R.

PPARδ transgenic and knock-out mice indicate an involvement of PPARδ in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity; however, the precise mechanisms by which PPARδ regulates these pathways in skeletal muscle remain unclear. In this study, we determined the effect of selective PPARδ agonism with the synthetic ligand, GW501516, on FAO and mitochondrial gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that activation of PPARδ by GW501516 led to a robust increase in mRNA levels of key lipid metabolism genes. Mitochondrial gene expression and function were not induced under the same conditions. Additionally, the activation of Pdk4 transcription by PPARδ was coactivated by PGC-1α. PGC-1α, but not PGC-1β, was essential for full activation of Cpt-1b and Pdk4 gene expression via PPARδ agonism. Furthermore, the induction of FAO by PPARδ agonism was completely abolished in the absence of both PGC-1α and PGC-1β. Conversely, PGC-1α-driven FAO was independent of PPARδ. Neither GW501516 treatment nor knockdown of PPARδ affects PGC-1α-induced mitochondrial gene expression in primary myotubes. These results demonstrate that pharmacological activation of PPARδ induces FAO via PGC-1α. However, PPARδ agonism does not induce mitochondrial gene expression and function.

Tanaka T. Sakai J. Endocr. J. 2007; 54: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Certain PPARs regulate transcription in response to fatty acids and are potential therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders (1.Takahashi S. Tanaka T. Sakai J. Endocr. J. 2007; 54: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Three PPAR family members have been identified. PPARα is primarily expressed in the liver but also in heart, kidney, and brown fat, where it regulates fatty acid catabolism. PPARγ is highly expressed in adipose tissue and is a key regulator of adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity. The expression of PPARδ is more ubiquitous, with relatively high levels in metabolically active tissues, such as muscle, liver, and adipose tissue (2.Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauça M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Selective activation of PPARδ by agonists has been shown to improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in mouse models of obesity and insulin resistance. These effects are mainly attributed to the agonists' capacity to activate fatty acid transport and oxidation (1.Takahashi S. Tanaka T. Sakai J. Endocr. J. 2007; 54: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, recent reports suggest that activation of PPARδ increases mitochondrial gene expression and function. The strongest evidence stems from the muscle-specific VP16-PPARδ transgenic mice, in which a constitutively active fusion protein is overexpressed specifically in the muscle using the skeletal α-actin promoter (3.Wang Y.X. Zhang C.L. Yu R.T. Cho H.K. Nelson M.C. Bayuga-Ocampo C.R. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e294Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). These mice exhibit enhanced mitochondrial gene expression in association with a fiber type switch from fast glycolytic type II fibers to slow oxidative type I fibers. Type I fibers utilize fatty acids as their main fuel and are more fatigue resistant. Concordantly, PPARδ transgenic mice display enhanced exercise endurance when compared with the wild-type mice. However, these studies were done with a PPARδ fusion protein, so it is not yet clear to what extent those results represent the physiological function of the native PPARδ protein.A mouse model overexpressing the native PPARδ in muscle was also reported (4.Luquet S. Lopez-Soriano J. Holst D. Fredenrich A. Melki J. Rassoulzadegan M. Grimaldi P.A. FASEB J. 2003; (03–0269fje)PubMed Google Scholar). These mice exhibit a much milder phenotype with respect to mitochondrial oxidative capacity when compared with the VP16-PPARδ mice. Nevertheless, overexpression of the native PPARδ increased the percentage of oxidative fibers that are succinate dehydrogenase-positive in tibialis anterior muscle, correlating with an increase in citrate synthase (CS) and β-hydroxy-CoA dehydrogenase activities.PGC-1α (PPARγ coactivator-1α) and PGC-1β are important physiological transcriptional regulators of oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC-1α is induced in a tissue-specific manner under conditions such as cold, fasting, and exercise. It promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative capacity, and FAO by increasing the expression and activation of various transcription factors, including mitochondrial transcription factor A, nuclear respiration factor 1 and 2, PPARs, and ERRα (estrogen-related receptor α) (5.Handschin C. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2006; 27: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 6.Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S. Lowell B. Scarpulla R.C.

The PGC-1α knock-out (KO) mice display reduced mitochondrial function and oxidative capacity (7.Lin J. Wu P.H. Tarr P.T. Lindenberg K.S. St-Pierre J. Zhang C.Y. Mootha V.K. Jäger S. Vianna C.R.

Interestingly, PGC-1α expression was not increased in muscle from either the VP16-PPARδ transgenic mice or the native PPARδ transgenic mice, leading to the assumption that PPARδ might act downstream or independent of PGC-1α (3.Wang Y.X. Zhang C.L. Yu R.T. Cho H.K. Nelson M.C. Bayuga-Ocampo C.R. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e294Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 4.Luquet S. Lopez-Soriano J. Holst D. Fredenrich A. Melki J. Rassoulzadegan M. Grimaldi P.A. FASEB J. 2003; (03–0269fje)PubMed Google Scholar).Recently, Schuler et al. (9.Schuler M. Ali F. Chambon C. Duteil D. Bornert J.M. Tardivel A. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Chambon P. Metzger D. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 407-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) reported that the muscle-specific PPARδ KO mice have reduced oxidative capacity and mitochondrial gene expression in muscle. In contrast to the findings in the PPARδ transgenic mouse models, the expression levels of PGC-1α and mitochondrial transcription factor A were reduced in the PPARδ KO muscles. Thus, the authors suggested that PPARδ acts upstream of PGC-1α and induces PGC-1α expression in muscle.Genetic mouse models are very useful but have their limitations with respect to the prediction of pharmacological effects. Although activation of PPARδ by agonists, such as GW501516, has been shown to improve glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, the impact on mitochondrial biogenesis and function is not well characterized (3.Wang Y.X. Zhang C.L. Yu R.T. Cho H.K. Nelson M.C. Bayuga-Ocampo C.R. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e294Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 16.Tanaka T. Yamamoto J. Iwasaki S. Asaba H.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15924-15929Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). In addition, the underlying molecular mechanisms of PPARδ activation on lipid metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative capacity are not fully understood based on the phenotyping results obtained from the PPARδ transgenic and KO mouse models (3.Wang Y.X. Zhang C.L. Yu R.T. Cho H.K. Nelson M.C. Bayuga-Ocampo C.R. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e294Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 9.Schuler M. Ali F. Chambon C. Duteil D.

Given the mitochondrial phenotypes of the PPARδ mouse models, it is tempting to speculate that pharmacological activation of PPARδ exerts beneficial effects on obesity and insulin resistance in a way that mimics what is happening during physical exercise. We therefore investigated first whether pharmacological activation of the endogenous PPARδ induces mitochondrial biogenesis and enhances mitochondrial function in muscle. Second, we used genetic tools to investigate the mechanisms of PPARδ in regulating energy metabolism, specifically the interdependence of PPARδ and PGC-1 transcriptional coactivators in the regulation of FAO and mitochondrial gene expression and function.DISCUSSIONIn this study, the effects of pharmacological activation of PPARδ on lipid metabolism and mitochondrial gene expression were examined in vitro and in vivo. As expected, activation of PPARδ with GW501516 resulted in a robust activation of genes involved in lipid metabolism (CPT-1b, PDK4, and UCP3) in vivo and in vitro as well as increased FAO rate in primary muscle cells. However, PPARδ agonism failed to increase mitochondrial gene expression and function in vitro and in vivo (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Therefore, the effects of pharmacological activation of the endogenous PPARδ do not fully recapitulate the effects observed in the VP16-PPARδ transgenic mouse or the muscle-specific PPARδ KO mouse model, in which mitochondrial biogenesis was strongly induced or decreased, respectively (3.Wang Y.X. Zhang C.L. Yu R.T. Cho H.K. Nelson M.C. Bayuga-Ocampo C.R. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e294Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). In addition, GW501516 treatment did not cause a fiber type switch, as it has been seen in the VP16-PPARδ transgenic and muscle-specific PPARδ mouse model and could be developmentally regulated. Despite the lack of increased mitochondrial function, activation of PPARδ improved glucose homeostasis in the obese and insulin-resistant ob/ob mice (Fig. 2), confirming its potency in ameliorating metabolic disorders (1.Takahashi S. Tanaka T. Sakai J. Endocr. J. 2007; 54: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the effects of PPARδ activity on glucose homeostasis are most likely mediated by increased lipid oxidation rates or other not yet known PPARδ effects, which are not dependent on an increase in muscle mitochondrial gene expression.We also investigated the molecular mechanisms by which activation of PPARδ regulates lipid metabolism. PGC-1α has been shown to enhance the transcriptional activity of PPARs in luciferase assays (18.Dressel U. Allen T.L. Pippal J.B. Rohde P.R. Lau P. Muscat G.E.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2477-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 20.Wang Y.X. Lee C.H. Tiep S. Yu R.T. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M. Cell. 2003; 113: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). However, it was not known to what extent this coactivation is essential for the action of PPARδ on endogenous target gene expression. Our data revealed that PGC-1α, but not PGC-1β, was required for the full activation of Cpt-1b and Pdk4 by PPARδ (). Since PPARδ mRNA levels were not altered in the PGC-1α KO primary myotubes or in the muscle of either the PGC-1α KO mice or the MCK-PGC-1α transgenic mice, 3S. Kleiner, V. Nguyen-Tran, O. Baré, X. Huang, B. Spiegelman, and Z. Wu, unpublished data. it is unlikely that PGC-1α regulates PPARδ expression directly. Thus, the impact of PGC-1α on PPARδ-mediated effects is most likely through coactivation of this receptor. This is supported by the synergistic action of PGC-1α and GW501516 on these genes (Fig. 5C). In addition, our data show that PGC-1α directly coactivates the Pdk4 promoter via PPARδ in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Others had reported a similar effect of PGC-1α on the Cpt-1b promoter (18.Dressel U. Allen T.L. Pippal J.B. Rohde P.R. Lau P. Muscat G.E.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2477-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Interestingly, UCP3 appears to be a PPARδ-specific target gene whose expression was induced by PPARδ agonism in a PGC-1α-independent manner (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5).We further investigated the roles of PGC-1 coactivators in mediating FAO induced by GW501516. Deletion of PGC-1α, but not PGC-1β, significantly reduced the induction of FAO rate induced by GW501516 (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). Surprisingly, GW-induced fat oxidation was completed abolished in the absence of both PGC-1α and PGC-1β proteins despite an induction of Cpt-1b, Pdk4, and Ucp3 expression comparable with the PGC-1α KO cells (Fig. 7). We believe that a strong reduction of mitochondrial function in the absence of both PGC-1 coactivators might contribute to this. Under normal conditions where PGC-1 proteins are expressed, activation of PPARδ triggers an increase in fatty acid β-oxidation through up-regulation of the key FAO target genes. PGC-1α enhances the action of PPARδ on Cpt-1b and Pdk4 in a PPARδ ligand-dependent manner. In addition, PGC-1 proteins are essential to maintain mitochondrial gene expression, including genes involved in lipid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and tricarboxylic acid cycle to ensure the proper function of mitochondria. The final product of β-oxidation is metabolized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which yields reducing agents that are subsequently oxidized in the ETC to generate ATP in the functional mitochondria (Fig. 9A). In the absence of PGC-1 proteins, PPARδ activation can still increase the expression of its target genes to a certain extent. However, mitochondrial oxidative capacity, such as tricarboxylic acid cycle and ETC activities, is discordantly reduced, which in turn hinders an increase in fatty acid β-oxidation (Fig. 9B). Similarly, Koves et al. (21.Koves T.R. Li P. An J. Akimoto T. Slentz D. Ilkayeva O. Dohm G.L. Yan Z. Newgard C.B. Muoio D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33588-33598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) suggested that high lipid supply, under conditions of low PGC-1α, could provoke a disconnection between mitochondrial β-oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which might contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Our data support the hypothesis that PGC-1α furnishes the mitochondria to cope with high lipid load by coordinately regulating fatty acid β-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and electron transport chain activity (21.Koves T.R. Li P. An J. Akimoto T. Slentz D. Ilkayeva O. Dohm G.L. Yan Z. Newgard C.B. Muoio D.M. J. Biol.

Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 45-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar).Although PGC-1α is able to coactivate PPARδ on the Cpt-1b and Pdk4 genes, PPARδ does not seem to be essential for PGC-1α-mediated gene expression, including Cpt-1b, Pdk4, and mitochondrial genes. Knockdown of PPARδ did not affect the transcriptional program induced by PGC-1α; nor did it reduce PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial function in primary myotubes. Our results indicate that PGC-1α does not require the presence of PPARδ to activate mitochondrial biogenesis, which is most likely mediated through ERRα (19.Huss J.M. Torra I.P. Staels B. Giguère V. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9079-9091Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar).In summary, our study shows that activation of the endogenous PPARδ using a synthetic ligand increased lipid oxidation and improved glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. However, PPARδ agonism failed to induce mitochondrial gene expression and function in vitro and in vivo, which was confirmed by another study (25.Narkar V.A. Downes M. Yu R.T. Embler E. Wang Y.X.

Cell. 2008; 134: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) published during the revision of this paper. In addition, PGC-1α coactivates PDK4 transcription via PPARδ in a ligand-dependent manner. PGC-1α is required for full activation of FAO by PPARδ in muscle cells. Furthermore, both PGC-1α and PGC-1β are essential for PPARδ-driven fat oxidation. We hypothesize that PGC-1α and PGC-1β provide a functional mitochondrial environment to allow an increased FAO rate through activation of PPARδ (Fig. 9). Conversely, PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty oxidation appear to be independent of PPARδ.

Certain PPARs regulate transcription in response to fatty acids and are potential therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders (1.Takahashi S. Tanaka T. Sakai J. Endocr. J. 2007; 54: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Three PPAR family members have been identified. PPARα is primarily expressed in the liver but also in heart, kidney, and brown fat, where it regulates fatty acid catabolism. PPARγ is highly expressed in adipose tissue and is a key regulator of adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity. The expression of PPARδ is more ubiquitous, with relatively high levels in metabolically active tissues, such as muscle, liver, and adipose tissue (2.Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauça M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Selective activation of PPARδ by agonists has been shown to improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in mouse models of obesity and insulin resistance. These effects are mainly attributed to the agonists' capacity to activate fatty acid transport and oxidation (1.Takahashi S. Tanaka T. Sakai J. Endocr. J. 2007; 54: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, recent reports suggest that activation of PPARδ increases mitochondrial gene expression and function. The strongest evidence stems from the muscle-specific VP16-PPARδ transgenic mice, in which a constitutively active fusion protein is overexpressed specifically in the muscle using the skeletal α-actin promoter (3.Wang Y.X.

A mouse model overexpressing the native PPARδ in muscle was also reported (4.Luquet S. Lopez-Soriano J. Holst D. Fredenrich A. Melki J. Rassoulzadegan M. Grimaldi P.A. FASEB J. 2003; (03–0269fje)PubMed Google Scholar). These mice exhibit a much milder phenotype with respect to mitochondrial oxidative capacity when compared with the VP16-PPARδ mice. Nevertheless, overexpression of the native PPARδ increased the percentage of oxidative fibers that are succinate dehydrogenase-positive in tibialis anterior muscle, correlating with an increase in citrate synthase (CS) and β-hydroxy-CoA dehydrogenase activities. PGC-1α (PPARγ coactivator-1α) and PGC-1β are important physiological transcriptional regulators of oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC-1α is induced in a tissue-specific manner under conditions such as cold, fasting, and exercise. It promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative capacity, and FAO by increasing the expression and activation of various transcription factors, including mitochondrial transcription factor A, nuclear respiration factor 1 and 2, PPARs, and ERRα (estrogen-related receptor α) (5.Handschin C.

Interestingly, PGC-1α expression was not increased in muscle from either the VP16-PPARδ transgenic mice or the native PPARδ transgenic mice, leading to the assumption that PPARδ might act downstream or independent of PGC-1α (3.Wang Y.X.

In contrast to the findings in the PPARδ transgenic mouse models, the expression levels of PGC-1α and mitochondrial transcription factor A were reduced in the PPARδ KO muscles. Thus, the authors suggested that PPARδ acts upstream of PGC-1α and induces PGC-1α expression in muscle. Genetic mouse models are very useful but have their limitations with respect to the prediction of pharmacological effects. Although activation of PPARδ by agonists, such as GW501516, has been shown to improve glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, the impact on mitochondrial biogenesis and function is not well characterized (3.Wang Y.X.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15924-15929Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). In addition, the underlying molecular mechanisms of PPARδ activation on lipid metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative capacity are not fully understood based on the phenotyping results obtained from the PPARδ transgenic and KO mouse models (3.Wang Y.X. Zhang C.L. Yu R.T. Cho H.K. Nelson M.C. Bayuga-Ocampo C.R. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e294Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 9.Schuler M. Ali F. Chambon C. Duteil D.

Given the mitochondrial phenotypes of the PPARδ mouse models, it is tempting to speculate that pharmacological activation of PPARδ exerts beneficial effects on obesity and insulin resistance in a way that mimics what is happening during physical exercise. We therefore investigated first whether pharmacological activation of the endogenous PPARδ induces mitochondrial biogenesis and enhances mitochondrial function in muscle. Second, we used genetic tools to investigate the mechanisms of PPARδ in regulating energy metabolism, specifically the interdependence of PPARδ and PGC-1 transcriptional coactivators in the regulation of FAO and mitochondrial gene expression and function. DISCUSSIONIn this study, the effects of pharmacological activation of PPARδ on lipid metabolism and mitochondrial gene expression were examined in vitro and in vivo. As expected, activation of PPARδ with GW501516 resulted in a robust activation of genes involved in lipid metabolism (CPT-1b, PDK4, and UCP3) in vivo and in vitro as well as increased FAO rate in primary muscle cells. However, PPARδ agonism failed to increase mitochondrial gene expression and function in vitro and in vivo (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Therefore, the effects of pharmacological activation of the endogenous PPARδ do not fully recapitulate the effects observed in the VP16-PPARδ transgenic mouse or the muscle-specific PPARδ KO mouse model, in which mitochondrial biogenesis was strongly induced or decreased, respectively (3.Wang Y.X. Zhang C.L. Yu R.T. Cho H.K. Nelson M.C. Bayuga-Ocampo C.R. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e294Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). In addition, GW501516 treatment did not cause a fiber type switch, as it has been seen in the VP16-PPARδ transgenic and muscle-specific PPARδ mouse model and could be developmentally regulated. Despite the lack of increased mitochondrial function, activation of PPARδ improved glucose homeostasis in the obese and insulin-resistant ob/ob mice (Fig. 2), confirming its potency in ameliorating metabolic disorders (1.Takahashi S. Tanaka T. Sakai J. Endocr. J. 2007; 54: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the effects of PPARδ activity on glucose homeostasis are most likely mediated by increased lipid oxidation rates or other not yet known PPARδ effects, which are not dependent on an increase in muscle mitochondrial gene expression.We also investigated the molecular mechanisms by which activation of PPARδ regulates lipid metabolism. PGC-1α has been shown to enhance the transcriptional activity of PPARs in luciferase assays (18.Dressel U. Allen T.L. Pippal J.B. Rohde P.R. Lau P. Muscat G.E.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2477-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 20.Wang Y.X. Lee C.H. Tiep S. Yu R.T. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M. Cell. 2003; 113: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). However, it was not known to what extent this coactivation is essential for the action of PPARδ on endogenous target gene expression. Our data revealed that PGC-1α, but not PGC-1β, was required for the full activation of Cpt-1b and Pdk4 by PPARδ (). Since PPARδ mRNA levels were not altered in the PGC-1α KO primary myotubes or in the muscle of either the PGC-1α KO mice or the MCK-PGC-1α transgenic mice, 3S. Kleiner, V. Nguyen-Tran, O. Baré, X. Huang, B. Spiegelman, and Z. Wu, unpublished data. it is unlikely that PGC-1α regulates PPARδ expression directly. Thus, the impact of PGC-1α on PPARδ-mediated effects is most likely through coactivation of this receptor. This is supported by the synergistic action of PGC-1α and GW501516 on these genes (Fig. 5C). In addition, our data show that PGC-1α directly coactivates the Pdk4 promoter via PPARδ in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Others had reported a similar effect of PGC-1α on the Cpt-1b promoter (18.Dressel U. Allen T.L. Pippal J.B. Rohde P.R. Lau P. Muscat G.E.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2477-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Interestingly, UCP3 appears to be a PPARδ-specific target gene whose expression was induced by PPARδ agonism in a PGC-1α-independent manner (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5).We further investigated the roles of PGC-1 coactivators in mediating FAO induced by GW501516. Deletion of PGC-1α, but not PGC-1β, significantly reduced the induction of FAO rate induced by GW501516 (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). Surprisingly, GW-induced fat oxidation was completed abolished in the absence of both PGC-1α and PGC-1β proteins despite an induction of Cpt-1b, Pdk4, and Ucp3 expression comparable with the PGC-1α KO cells (Fig. 7). We believe that a strong reduction of mitochondrial function in the absence of both PGC-1 coactivators might contribute to this. Under normal conditions where PGC-1 proteins are expressed, activation of PPARδ triggers an increase in fatty acid β-oxidation through up-regulation of the key FAO target genes. PGC-1α enhances the action of PPARδ on Cpt-1b and Pdk4 in a PPARδ ligand-dependent manner. In addition, PGC-1 proteins are essential to maintain mitochondrial gene expression, including genes involved in lipid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and tricarboxylic acid cycle to ensure the proper function of mitochondria. The final product of β-oxidation is metabolized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which yields reducing agents that are subsequently oxidized in the ETC to generate ATP in the functional mitochondria (Fig. 9A). In the absence of PGC-1 proteins, PPARδ activation can still increase the expression of its target genes to a certain extent. However, mitochondrial oxidative capacity, such as tricarboxylic acid cycle and ETC activities, is discordantly reduced, which in turn hinders an increase in fatty acid β-oxidation (Fig. 9B). Similarly, Koves et al. (21.Koves T.R. Li P. An J. Akimoto T. Slentz D. Ilkayeva O. Dohm G.L. Yan Z. Newgard C.B. Muoio D.M. J. Biol.

Our data support the hypothesis that PGC-1α furnishes the mitochondria to cope with high lipid load by coordinately regulating fatty acid β-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and electron transport chain activity (21.Koves T.R. Li P. An J. Akimoto T. Slentz D. Ilkayeva O. Dohm G.L. Yan Z. Newgard C.B. Muoio D.M. J. Biol.

Knockdown of PPARδ did not affect the transcriptional program induced by PGC-1α; nor did it reduce PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial function in primary myotubes. Our results indicate that PGC-1α does not require the presence of PPARδ to activate mitochondrial biogenesis, which is most likely mediated through ERRα (19.Huss J.M. Torra I.P. Staels B. Giguère V. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9079-9091Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar).In summary, our study shows that activation of the endogenous PPARδ using a synthetic ligand increased lipid oxidation and improved glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. However, PPARδ agonism failed to induce mitochondrial gene expression and function in vitro and in vivo, which was confirmed by another study (25.Narkar V.A. Downes M. Yu R.T. Embler E. Wang Y.X.

In addition, PGC-1α coactivates PDK4 transcription via PPARδ in a ligand-dependent manner. PGC-1α is required for full activation of FAO by PPARδ in muscle cells. Furthermore, both PGC-1α and PGC-1β are essential for PPARδ-driven fat oxidation. We hypothesize that PGC-1α and PGC-1β provide a functional mitochondrial environment to allow an increased FAO rate through activation of PPARδ (Fig. 9). Conversely, PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty oxidation appear to be independent of PPARδ. In this study, the effects of pharmacological activation of PPARδ on lipid metabolism and mitochondrial gene expression were examined in vitro and in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2012209428,"Background CD133 (Prominin) is widely used as a marker for the identification and isolation of neural precursor cells from normal brain or tumor tissue. However, the assumption that CD133 is expressed constitutively in neural precursor cells has not been examined. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we demonstrate that CD133 and a second marker CD15 are expressed heterogeneously in uniformly undifferentiated human neural stem (NS) cell cultures. After fractionation by flow cytometry, clonogenic tripotent cells are found in populations negative or positive for either marker. We further show that CD133 is down-regulated at the mRNA level in cells lacking CD133 immunoreactivity. Cell cycle profiling reveals that CD133 negative cells largely reside in G1/G0, while CD133 positive cells are predominantly in S, G2, or M phase. A similar pattern is apparent in mouse NS cell lines. Compared to mouse NS cells, however, human NS cell cultures harbour an increased proportion of CD133 negative cells and display a longer doubling time. This may in part reflect a sub-population of slow- or non-cycling cells amongst human NS cells because we find that around 5% of cells do not take up BrdU over a 14-day labelling period. Non-proliferating NS cells remain undifferentiated and at least some of them are capable of re-entry into the cell cycle and subsequent continuous expansion. Conclusions The finding that a significant fraction of clonogenic neural stem cells lack the established markers CD133 and CD15, and that some of these cells may be dormant or slow-cycling, has implications for approaches to identify and isolate neural stem cells and brain cancer stem cells. Our data also suggest the possibility that CD133 may be specifically down-regulated during G0/G1, and this should be considered when this marker is used to identify and isolate other tissue and cancer stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W1980564720,"Hemoglobin (Hb) uniquely associates with proinflammatory HDL in atherogenic mice and coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. In this paper, we report that Hb and its scavenger proteins, haptoglobin (Hp) and hemopexin (Hx) are significantly increased in apoA-1-containing particles of HDL both in mouse models of hyperlipidemia and in CHD patients, when compared with wild type mice and healthy donors, respectively. We further demonstrate that the association of Hb, Hp, and Hx proteins with HDL positively correlates with inflammatory properties of HDL and systemic inflammation in CHD patients. Interestingly, HDL from Hp<sup>−/−</sup> mice under atherogenic conditions does not accumulate Hb and is anti-inflammatory, suggesting that (i) Hp is required for the association of Hb with HDL and (ii) Hb·Hp complexes regulate the inflammatory properties of HDL. Moreover, treatment of apoE<sup>−/−</sup> mice with an apoA-1 mimetic peptide resulted in significant dissociation of Hb·Hp complexes from HDL and improvement of HDL inflammatory properties. Our data strongly suggest that HDL can become proinflammatory via the Hb·Hp pathway in mice and humans, and dissociation of Hb·Hp·Hx complexes from apoA-1-containing particles of HDL may be a novel target for the treatment of CHD."

Mycolic acids, α-branched and β-hydroxylated fatty acids of unusual chain length (C30-C90), are the hallmark of the Corynebacterineae suborder that includes the causative agents of tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and leprosy (Mycobacterium leprae). Members of each genus biosynthesize mycolic acids of specific chain lengths, a feature used in taxonomy. For example, Corynebacterium holds the simplest prototypes (C32-C36), called “corynomycolic acids,” which result from an enzymatic condensation between two regular size fatty acids (C16–C18). In contrast, the longest mycolates (C60-C90) are the products of condensation between a very long meromycolic chain (C40-C60) and a shorter α-chain (C22-C26) (1.Marrakchi H. Bardou F. Lanéelle M.A. Daffé M. Daffé M. Reyrat J.-M. The Mycobacterial Cell Envelope. ASM Press, Washington, DC2008: 41-62Google Scholar). These so-called “eumycolic acids” are found in mycobacteria and display various structural features present on the meromycolic chain. Eumycolic acids are major and essential components of the mycobacterial envelope where they contribute to the formation of the outer membrane (2.Zuber B. Chami M. Houssin C. Dubochet J. Griffiths G.

They also impact on the pathogenicity of some mycobacterial species (4.Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb.

Yet, any attempt to fractionate these extracts to identify the proteins involved has ended in failure.

Furthermore, FadD32, predicted to belong to a new class of long-chain acyl-AMP ligases (FAAL) (12.Trivedi O.A. Arora P. Sridharan V. Tickoo R. Mohanty D. Gokhale R.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), is most likely required for the activation of the meromycolic chain prior to the condensation reaction. At last, the cmrA gene controls the reduction of the β-keto function to yield the final mycolic motif (13.Lea-Smith D.J. Pyke J.S. Tull D. McConville M.J. Coppel R.L. Crellin P.K. J. Biol.

Pks13 is a type I polyketide synthase (PKS) made of a minimal module holding ketosynthase (KS), acyltransferase (AT), and acyl carrier protein (ACP) domains, and additional N-terminal ACP and C-terminal thioesterase domains (Fig. 1). Its ACP domains are naturally activated by the 4′-phosphopantetheinyl (P-pant) transferase PptT (14.Chalut C. Botella L. de Sousa-D'Auria C. Houssin C. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 8511-8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The P-pant arm has the general function of carrying the substrate acyl chain via a thioester bond involving its terminal thiol group. In the present article we report the purification of a soluble activated form of the large Pks13 protein. For the first time, the loading mechanisms of both types of substrates on specific domains of the PKS were investigated. We describe a unique catalytic mechanism of the Pks13-FadD32 enzymatic couple and the development of an in vitro condensation assay that generates the formation of α-alkyl β-ketoacids, the precursors of mycolic acids.DiscussionThe present work demonstrated that the activated Pks13 enzyme of M. tuberculosis, in adequate experimental conditions, has a condensing activity in vitro and is able to synthesize, in coupled reaction with FadD32, the biosynthetic precursors of mycolic acids, α-alkyl β-ketoacids, from a fatty acyl-AMP and a 2-carboxyacyl-CoA (Fig. 8). For a matter of both solubility and availability of radiolabeled molecules, the function of Pks13 was studied in the presence of substrates shorter than its presumed natural substrates (C24-C26 carboxyacyl-CoAs and C40-C60 meromycoloyl-AMP) within mycobacteria. Nevertheless, the fact that Pks13 of M. tuberculosis is able to condense relatively short chain substrates (C12, C16), equivalent to those used by the condensing enzyme from Corynebacterium, correlates with the production of C32-C34 corynomycolates upon heterologous complementation of a C. glutamicum pks13 mutant strain by the M. tuberculosis pks13 gene. 4C. de Sousa d'Auria and C. Houssin, personal communication. If the Pks13 enzyme from M. tuberculosis presents a large specificity toward the chain length of its substrates, the length of the mero and branch chains of mycolic acids might be controlled by the enzymes that activate Pks13 substrates, i.e. FadD32 and the acyl-CoA carboxylase complex AccA3-AccD4 (Fig. 1). Consistently, it has been recently shown that AccA3-AccD4 from M. tuberculosis exhibits no activity in the presence acyl-CoA shorter than C24-C26, which perfectly matches with the required size of the extender unit during mycolic condensation in this bacterial species (Fig. 1) (11.Oh T.J.

To simplify, C16 acyl chains were drawn. FadD32 synthesizes meromycoloyl-AMPs from the meromycolic acids and ATP (1). The meromycoloyl chain of these intermediates is then specifically loaded by FadD32 onto the P-pant arm of the N-ACP domain of Pks13 (2). This is an acyl-AMP/ACP transacylation. The meromycoloyl chain is then transferred onto the KS domain (3). The extender unit carboxyacyl-CoA is specifically loaded onto the AT domain, which catalyzes the covalent attachment of the carboxyacyl chain to its active site (1′) and its subsequent transfer specifically onto the C-ACP domain (2′). The KS domain catalyzes the Claisen-type condensation between the meromycoloyl and the carboxyacyl chains to produce a α-alkyl β-ketothioester linked to the C-ACP domain (3′). Then, it is likely that the thioesterase domain catalyzes the release of the α-alkyl β-ketoacyl chain and its transfer onto an unknown acceptor (X1) (4′). Thus, FadD32 constitutes one of the two domains of the loading module of the polyketide synthase formed by both FadD32 and Pks13 polypeptides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Investigation of the different steps involved in condensation resulted in the determination of the general catalytic scheme leading to the formation of the α-alkyl β-ketoacids (Fig. 8). The carboxyacyl-CoA unit is loaded onto Pks13 via its AT domain. The latter has a predilection for both long chain and carboxylated molecules. Pks13 is an unprecedented polyketide synthase because its extender units do not correspond to the short classical units, malonyl-CoA or methyl-malonyl-CoA, used by the other PKSs. The predilection of this enzyme for carboxyacyl-CoAs of unusual chain length is reflected in the primary structure of its AT domain. Indeed, the latter is relatively distant from the primary structure of the AT domain of other PKSs and fatty acid synthases, as displayed by the distance tree obtained by Blast alignment (supplementary Fig. S6).Our data showed that the acyl chain of the acyl-AMPs produced by the FadD32 enzyme in the presence of a fatty acid and ATP are specifically transferred onto the N-ACP domain of Pks13 (Fig. 8). There are two possible mechanisms of acylation in trans: (i) release of the acyl-AMPs by FadD32 and adventitious acylation of the reactive –SH group of the P-pant arm of N-ACPPks13 and (ii) enzyme-dependent transfer of the acyl chain from AMP to Pks13. The present work demonstrated that the transfer cannot be undertaken by the AT domain of Pks13 in vitro, but is dependent upon the presence of active FadD32 that catalyzes a reaction of acyl-AMP/N-ACPPks13 transacylation (Fig. 8). Moreover, using Pks13 mutant proteins, we showed that FadD32 is unable to load an acyl chain onto the C-ACPPks13 domain. The selectivity of FadD32 for the N-ACP domain of Pks13 might be facilitated by the substantial sequence divergence (24% identity) between the two ACP-like domains of Pks13. The specificity between an adenylation enzyme and an ACP protein has been described for PKS and NRPS (24.Revill W.P. Bibb M.J. Hopwood D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5660-5667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Schmoock G. Pfennig F. Jewiarz J. Schlumbohm W. Laubinger W. Schauwecker F. Keller U. J. Biol.

However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an enzyme-dependent loading mechanism in the case of PKSs. Interestingly, we have observed that FadD32 could not be replaced by FadD26, a mycobacterial FAAL, during the condensation reaction, although FadD26 was able to load the acyl chain of its acyl-AMP products onto Pks13 in vitro. A privileged interaction between FadD32 and Pks13 might be required for proper folding of the PKS necessary to the subsequent steps of transfer and catalysis. The fact that the fadD32 gene is essential in mycobacteria (8.Portevin D. de Sousa-D'Auria C. Montrozier H. Houssin C. Stella A. Lanéelle M.A. Bardou F. Guilhot C. Daffé M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8862-8874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) is consistent with our data and proves that none of the FadD enzymes display a redundant activity in vivo. One can reasonably propose that, in vivo, FadD32 activates the very long meromycolic acids into meromycoloyl-AMPs and transfers the meromycolic acyl chains onto N-ACPPks13. This is reminiscent of the double function of adenylation and transfer described for some so-called “adenylation domains” found in NRPS or NRPS-PKS enzymes (26.Quadri L.E. Sello J. Keating T.A. Weinreb P.H. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). As in the case of these enzymes, one can propose that FadD32 together with N-ACPPks13 correspond to the “loading module” of a PKS formed by both FadD32 and Pks13 (Fig. 8). The discrete FadD32 enzyme is reminiscent of the lone standing salicyl-AMP ligase domains MbtA and YbtE found in the hybrid NRPS-PKSs involved in mycobactin and yersiniabactin biosyntheses, respectively (26.Quadri L.E.

The knowledge of Pks13 enzymatic properties as well as of the experimental conditions for in vitro activity assays will now serve as fundamental tools for screening for inhibitors of this very original condensing enzyme that, because of its essentiality in mycobacteria (7.Portevin D. De Sousa-D'Auria C. Houssin C. Grimaldi C. Chami M. Daffé M. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and its characteristic features, represents an excellent target for novel antimycobacterial drug design. Mycolic acids, α-branched and β-hydroxylated fatty acids of unusual chain length (C30-C90), are the hallmark of the Corynebacterineae suborder that includes the causative agents of tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and leprosy (Mycobacterium leprae). Members of each genus biosynthesize mycolic acids of specific chain lengths, a feature used in taxonomy. For example, Corynebacterium holds the simplest prototypes (C32-C36), called “corynomycolic acids,” which result from an enzymatic condensation between two regular size fatty acids (C16–C18). In contrast, the longest mycolates (C60-C90) are the products of condensation between a very long meromycolic chain (C40-C60) and a shorter α-chain (C22-C26) (1.Marrakchi H. Bardou F. Lanéelle M.A. Daffé M. Daffé M. Reyrat J.-M. The Mycobacterial Cell Envelope. ASM Press, Washington, DC2008: 41-62Google Scholar). These so-called “eumycolic acids” are found in mycobacteria and display various structural features present on the meromycolic chain. Eumycolic acids are major and essential components of the mycobacterial envelope where they contribute to the formation of the outer membrane (2.Zuber B. Chami M. Houssin C. Dubochet J. Griffiths G.

They also impact on the pathogenicity of some mycobacterial species (4.Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first in vitro mycolate biosynthesis assays have been developed using Corynebacterium cell-wall extracts in the presence of a radioactive precursor (5.Walker R.W. Prome J.C. Lacave C.S. Biochim.

As in the case of these enzymes, one can propose that FadD32 together with N-ACPPks13 correspond to the “loading module” of a PKS formed by both FadD32 and Pks13 (Fig. 8). The discrete FadD32 enzyme is reminiscent of the lone standing salicyl-AMP ligase domains MbtA and YbtE found in the hybrid NRPS-PKSs involved in mycobactin and yersiniabactin biosyntheses, respectively (26.Quadri L.E.

The knowledge of Pks13 enzymatic properties as well as of the experimental conditions for in vitro activity assays will now serve as fundamental tools for screening for inhibitors of this very original condensing enzyme that, because of its essentiality in mycobacteria (7.Portevin D. De Sousa-D'Auria C. Houssin C. Grimaldi C. Chami M. Daffé M. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and its characteristic features, represents an excellent target for novel antimycobacterial drug design. The present work demonstrated that the activated Pks13 enzyme of M. tuberculosis, in adequate experimental conditions, has a condensing activity in vitro and is able to synthesize, in coupled reaction with FadD32, the biosynthetic precursors of mycolic acids, α-alkyl β-ketoacids, from a fatty acyl-AMP and a 2-carboxyacyl-CoA (Fig. 8). For a matter of both solubility and availability of radiolabeled molecules, the function of Pks13 was studied in the presence of substrates shorter than its presumed natural substrates (C24-C26 carboxyacyl-CoAs and C40-C60 meromycoloyl-AMP) within mycobacteria. Nevertheless, the fact that Pks13 of M. tuberculosis is able to condense relatively short chain substrates (C12, C16), equivalent to those used by the condensing enzyme from Corynebacterium, correlates with the production of C32-C34 corynomycolates upon heterologous complementation of a C. glutamicum pks13 mutant strain by the M. tuberculosis pks13 gene. 4C. de Sousa d'Auria and C. Houssin, personal communication. If the Pks13 enzyme from M. tuberculosis presents a large specificity toward the chain length of its substrates, the length of the mero and branch chains of mycolic acids might be controlled by the enzymes that activate Pks13 substrates, i.e. FadD32 and the acyl-CoA carboxylase complex AccA3-AccD4 (Fig. 1). Consistently, it has been recently shown that AccA3-AccD4 from M. tuberculosis exhibits no activity in the presence acyl-CoA shorter than C24-C26, which perfectly matches with the required size of the extender unit during mycolic condensation in this bacterial species (Fig. 1) (11.Oh T.J. Daniel J. Kim H.J. Sirakova T.D. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3899-3908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Investigation of the different steps involved in condensation resulted in the determination of the general catalytic scheme leading to the formation of the α-alkyl β-ketoacids (Fig. 8). The carboxyacyl-CoA unit is loaded onto Pks13 via its AT domain. The latter has a predilection for both long chain and carboxylated molecules. Pks13 is an unprecedented polyketide synthase because its extender units do not correspond to the short classical units, malonyl-CoA or methyl-malonyl-CoA, used by the other PKSs. The predilection of this enzyme for carboxyacyl-CoAs of unusual chain length is reflected in the primary structure of its AT domain. Indeed, the latter is relatively distant from the primary structure of the AT domain of other PKSs and fatty acid synthases, as displayed by the distance tree obtained by Blast alignment (supplementary Fig. S6). Our data showed that the acyl chain of the acyl-AMPs produced by the FadD32 enzyme in the presence of a fatty acid and ATP are specifically transferred onto the N-ACP domain of Pks13 (Fig. 8). There are two possible mechanisms of acylation in trans: (i) release of the acyl-AMPs by FadD32 and adventitious acylation of the reactive –SH group of the P-pant arm of N-ACPPks13 and (ii) enzyme-dependent transfer of the acyl chain from AMP to Pks13. The present work demonstrated that the transfer cannot be undertaken by the AT domain of Pks13 in vitro, but is dependent upon the presence of active FadD32 that catalyzes a reaction of acyl-AMP/N-ACPPks13 transacylation (Fig. 8). Moreover, using Pks13 mutant proteins, we showed that FadD32 is unable to load an acyl chain onto the C-ACPPks13 domain. The selectivity of FadD32 for the N-ACP domain of Pks13 might be facilitated by the substantial sequence divergence (24% identity) between the two ACP-like domains of Pks13. The specificity between an adenylation enzyme and an ACP protein has been described for PKS and NRPS (24.Revill W.P. Bibb M.J. Hopwood D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5660-5667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Schmoock G. Pfennig F. Jewiarz J. Schlumbohm W. Laubinger W. Schauwecker F. Keller U. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4339-4349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an enzyme-dependent loading mechanism in the case of PKSs. Interestingly, we have observed that FadD32 could not be replaced by FadD26, a mycobacterial FAAL, during the condensation reaction, although FadD26 was able to load the acyl chain of its acyl-AMP products onto Pks13 in vitro. A privileged interaction between FadD32 and Pks13 might be required for proper folding of the PKS necessary to the subsequent steps of transfer and catalysis. The fact that the fadD32 gene is essential in mycobacteria (8.Portevin D. de Sousa-D'Auria C. Montrozier H. Houssin C. Stella A. Lanéelle M.A. Bardou F. Guilhot C. Daffé M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8862-8874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) is consistent with our data and proves that none of the FadD enzymes display a redundant activity in vivo. One can reasonably propose that, in vivo, FadD32 activates the very long meromycolic acids into meromycoloyl-AMPs and transfers the meromycolic acyl chains onto N-ACPPks13.

https://openalex.org/W2081654383,"The expression of the NKG2D ligands on cancer cells leads to their recognition and elimination by host immune responses mediated by natural killer and T cells. UL16-binding proteins (ULBPs) are NKG2D ligands, which are scarcely expressed in epithelial tumours, favouring their evasion from the immune system. Herein, we investigated the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the repression of ULBPs in epithelial cancer cells. We show that ULBP1-3 expression is increased in tumour cells after exposure to the inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs) trichostatin A (TSA), which enhances the natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity of HeLa cells. Our experiments showed that the transcription factor Sp3 is crucial in the activation of the ULBP1 promoter by TSA. Furthermore, by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown and overexpression of HDAC1-3, we showed that HDAC3 is a repressor of ULBPs expression in epithelial cancer cells. Remarkably, TSA treatment caused the complete release of HDAC3 from the ULBP1-3 promoters. HDAC3 is recruited to the ULBP1 promoter through its interaction with Sp3 and TSA treatment interfered with this association. Together, we describe a new mechanism by which cancer cells may evade the immune response through the epigenetic modulation of the ULBPs expression and provide a model in which HDAC inhibitors may favour the elimination of transformed cells by increasing the immunogenicity of epithelial tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2091774132,"Aberrant mitochondrial function appears to play a central role in dopaminergic neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease (PD). 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP(+)), the active metabolite of N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), is a selective inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I and is widely used in rodent and cell models to elicit neurochemical alterations associated with PD. Recent findings suggest that Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), a critical activator of neuronal apoptosis, is involved in the dopaminergic cell death. In this study, the role of GSK-3beta in modulating MPP(+)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death was examined in vivo, and in two neuronal cell models namely primary cultured and immortalized neurons. In both cell models, MPTP/MPP(+) treatment caused cell death associated with time- and concentration-dependent activation of GSK-3beta, evidenced by the increased level of the active form of the kinase, i.e. GSK-3beta phosphorylated at tyrosine 216 residue. Using immunocytochemistry and subcellular fractionation techniques, we showed that GSK-3beta partially localized within mitochondria in both neuronal cell models. Moreover, MPP(+) treatment induced a significant decrease of the specific phospho-Tyr216-GSK-3beta labeling in mitochondria concomitantly with an increase into the cytosol. Using two distinct fluorescent probes, we showed that MPP(+) induced cell death through the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. Inhibition of GSK-3beta activity using well-characterized inhibitors, LiCl and kenpaullone, and RNA interference, prevented MPP(+)-induced cell death by blocking mitochondrial membrane potential changes and subsequent caspase-9 and -3 activation. These results indicate that GSK-3beta is a critical mediator of MPTP/MPP(+)-induced neurotoxicity through its ability to regulate mitochondrial functions. Inhibition of GSK-3beta activity might provide protection against mitochondrial stress-induced cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2110909120,"Since first described, acoels were considered members of the flatworms (Platyhelminthes). However, no clear synapomorphies among the three large flatworm taxa - the Catenulida, the Acoelomorpha and the Rhabditophora - have been characterized to date. Molecular phylogenies, on the other hand, commonly positioned acoels separate from other flatworms. Accordingly, our own multi-locus phylogenetic analysis using 43 genes and 23 animal species places the acoel flatworm Isodiametra pulchra at the base of all Bilateria, distant from other flatworms. By contrast, novel data on the distribution and proliferation of stem cells and the specific mode of epidermal replacement constitute a strong synapomorphy for the Acoela plus the major group of flatworms, the Rhabditophora. The expression of a piwi-like gene not only in gonadal, but also in adult somatic stem cells is another unique feature among bilaterians. These two independent stem-cell-related characters put the Acoela into the Platyhelminthes-Lophotrochozoa clade and account for the most parsimonious evolutionary explanation of epidermal cell renewal in the Bilateria. Most available multigene analyses produce conflicting results regarding the position of the acoels in the tree of life. Given these phylogenomic conflicts and the contradiction of developmental and morphological data with phylogenomic results, the monophyly of the phylum Platyhelminthes and the position of the Acoela remain unresolved. By these data, both the inclusion of Acoela within Platyhelminthes, and their separation from flatworms as basal bilaterians are well-supported alternatives."

While structural and functional alterations in mitochondria (mt) and their metabolites have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic neurodegenerative and vascular diseases, the relationship of inherited variants in the mitochondrial genome and mt haplogroup subtypes with advanced AMD has not been reported in large prospective cohorts.We examined the relationship of inherited mtDNA variants with advanced AMD in 1168 people using a three-stage design on samples from 12-year and 10-year prospective studies on the natural history of age-related eye disease. In Stage I we resequenced the entire genome in 99 elderly AMD-free controls and 215 people with advanced AMD from the 12-year study. A consistent association with AMD in 14 of 17 SNPs characterizing the mtDNA T haplogroup emerged. Further analysis revealed these associations were driven entirely by the T2 haplogroup, and characterized by two variants in Complex I genes (A11812G of MT-ND4 and A14233G of MT-ND6). We genotyped T haplogroups in an independent sample of 490 cases and 61 controls from the same study (Stage II) and in 56 cases and 246 controls from the 10-year study (Stage III). People in the T2 haplogroup were approximately 2.5 times more likely to have advanced AMD than their peers (odds ratio [OR] = 2.54, 95%CI 1.36-4.80, P<or=0.004) after considering the totality of evidence. Findings persisted after considering the impact of AMD-associated variants A69S and Y402H (OR = 5.19, 95%CI 1.19-22.69, P<or=0.029).Loci defining the mtDNA T2 haplogroup and Complex I are reasonable targets for novel functional analyses and therapeutic research in AMD."
https://openalex.org/W2094162382,"Background Multi-drug resistant (MDR) infections have become a major concern in hospitals worldwide. This study investigates membrane translocation, which is the first step required for drug action on internal bacterial targets. β-lactams, a major antibiotic class, use porins to pass through the outer membrane barrier of Gram-negative bacteria. Clinical reports have linked the MDR phenotype to altered membrane permeability including porin modification and efflux pump expression. Methodology/Principal Findings Here influx of β-lactams through the major Enterobacter aerogenes porin Omp36 is characterized. Conductance measurements through a single Omp36 trimer reconstituted into a planar lipid bilayer allowed us to count the passage of single β-lactam molecules. Statistical analysis of each transport event yielded the kinetic parameters of antibiotic travel through Omp36 and distinguishable translocation properties of β-lactams were quantified for ertapenem and cefepime. Expression of Omp36 in an otherwise porin-null bacterial strain is shown to confer increases in the killing rate of these antibiotics and in the corresponding bacterial susceptibility. Conclusions/Significance We propose the idea of a molecular “passport” that allows rapid transport of substrates through porins. Deciphering antibiotic translocation provides new insights for the design of novel drugs that may be highly effective at passing through the porin constriction zone. Such data may hold the key for the next generation of antibiotics capable of rapid intracellular accumulation to circumvent the further development MDR infections."
https://openalex.org/W1980571647,"Background Reelin is a large secreted protein of the extracellular matrix that has been proposed to participate to the etiology of schizophrenia. During development, reelin is crucial for the correct cytoarchitecture of laminated brain structures and is produced by a subset of neurons named Cajal-Retzius. After birth, most of these cells degenerate and reelin expression persists in postnatal and adult brain. The phenotype of neurons that bind secreted reelin and whether the continuous secretion of reelin is required for physiological functions at postnatal stages remain unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Combining immunocytochemical and pharmacological approaches, we first report that two distinct patterns of reelin expression are present in cultured hippocampal neurons. We show that in hippocampal cultures, reelin is secreted by GABAergic neurons displaying an intense reelin immunoreactivity (IR). We demonstrate that secreted reelin binds to receptors of the lipoprotein family on neurons with a punctate reelin IR. Secondly, using calcium imaging techniques, we examined the physiological consequences of reelin secretion blockade. Blocking protein secretion rapidly and reversibly changes the subunit composition of N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors (NMDARs) to a predominance of NR2B-containing NMDARs. Addition of recombinant or endogenously secreted reelin rescues the effects of protein secretion blockade and reverts the fraction of NR2B-containing NMDARs to control levels. Therefore, the continuous secretion of reelin is necessary to control the subunit composition of NMDARs in hippocampal neurons. Conclusions/Significance Our data show that the heterogeneity of reelin immunoreactivity correlates with distinct functional populations: neurons synthesizing and secreting reelin and/or neurons binding reelin. Furthermore, we show that continuous reelin secretion is a strict requirement to maintain the composition of NMDARs. We propose that reelin is a trans-neuronal messenger secreted by GABAergic neurons that regulates NMDARs homeostasis in postnatal hippocampus. Defects in reelin secretion could play a major role in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly those associated with deregulation of NMDARs such as schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2049621216,"Protein ubiquitylation is essential for many events linked to intracellular protein trafficking. Despite the significance of this process, the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of ubiquitylation remain largely unknown. Plasma membrane transporters are subjected to tightly regulated endocytosis, and ubiquitylation is a key signal at several stages of the endocytic pathway. The yeast monocarboxylate transporter Jen1 displays glucose-regulated endocytosis. We show here that casein kinase 1-dependent phosphorylation and HECT-ubiquitin ligase Rsp5-dependent ubiquitylation are required for Jen1 endocytosis. Ubiquitylation and endocytosis of Jen1 are induced within minutes in response to glucose addition. Jen1 is modified at the cell surface by oligo-ubiquitylation with ubiquitin-Lys(63) linked chain(s), and Jen1-Lys(338) is one of the target residues. Ubiquitin-Lys(63)-linked chain(s) are also required directly or indirectly to sort Jen1 into multivesicular bodies. Jen1 is one of the few examples for which ubiquitin-Lys(63)-linked chain(s) was shown to be required for correct trafficking at two stages of endocytosis: endocytic internalization and sorting at multivesicular bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2031304569,"To understand the link between peripheral immune activation and neuronal precursor biology, we investigated the effect of T-cell activation on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in female C57Bl/6 mice. A peripheral adaptive immune response triggered by adjuvant-induced rheumatoid arthritis (2 microg/microl methylated BSA) or staphylococcus enterotoxin B (EC(50) of 0.25 microg/ml per 20 g body weight) was associated with a transient increase in hippocampal precursor cell proliferation and neurogenesis as assessed by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Both treatments were paralleled by an increase in corticosterone levels in the hippocampus 1- to 2-fold over the physiological amount measured by quantitative radioimmunoassay. In contrast, intraperitoneal administration of the innate immune response activator lipopolysaccaride (EC(50) of 0.5 microg/ml per 20 g body weight) led to a chronic 5-fold increase of hippocampal glucocorticoid levels and a decrease of adult neurogenesis. In vitro exposure of murine neuronal progenitor cells to corticosterone triggered either cell death at high (1.5 nM) or proliferation at low (0.25 nM) concentrations. This effect could be blocked using a viral vector system expressing a transdomain of the glucocorticoid receptor. We suggest an evolutionary relevant communication route for the brain to respond to environmental stressors like inflammation mediated by glucocorticoid levels in the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2040415055,"Ubiquitination is essential for the endocytic sorting of various G protein-coupled receptors to lysosomes. Here we identify a distinct function of this covalent modification in controlling the later proteolytic processing of receptors. Mutation of all cytoplasmic lysine residues in the murine delta-opioid receptor blocked receptor ubiquitination without preventing ligand-induced endocytosis of receptors or their subsequent delivery to lysosomes, as verified by proteolysis of extramembrane epitope tags and down-regulation of radioligand binding to the transmembrane helices. Surprisingly, a functional screen revealed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4 specifically controls down-regulation of wild type receptors measured by radioligand binding without detectably affecting receptor delivery to lysosomes defined both immunochemically and biochemically. This specific AIP4-dependent regulation required direct ubiquitination of receptors and was also regulated by two deubiquitinating enzymes, AMSH and UBPY, which localized to late endosome/lysosome membranes containing internalized delta-opioid receptor. These results identify a distinct function of AIP4-dependent ubiquitination in controlling the later proteolytic processing of G protein-coupled receptors, without detectably affecting their endocytic sorting to lysosomes. We propose that ubiquitination or ubiquitination/deubiquitination cycling specifically regulates later proteolytic processing events required for destruction of the receptor's hydrophobic core."

Mattevi A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9.Joosten V. van Berkel W.J. Curr. Opin. Chem.

However, its role in reductive dehalogenation is quite unusual and not yet characterized. Flavin has also been implicated in just one bacterial reductive dehalogenation, although little information is available on this additional system other than its use of flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD) rather than FMN (12.Suzuki T. Kasia N. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2003; 15: 329-349Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Structural characterization of IYD is critical for identifying the active site properties that support its unique catalytic ability and substrate selectivity. Moreover this information contributes a molecular understanding of how mutations in IYD can disrupt function to cause iodide deficiency and hypothyroidism. Such mutants are particularly tragic because their detection often occurs only after developmental damage to patients has occurred (1.Moreno J.C. Klootwijk W. van Toor H. Pinto G. D'Alessandro M. Lèger A. Goudie D. Polak M. Grüters A. Visser T.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 1811-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Studies on IYD to date have been limited by its membrane association and transient expression in mammalian cells (3.Gnidehou S. Caillou B. Talbot M. Ohayon R. Kaniewski J. Noël-Hudson M.S. Morand S. Agnangji D. Sezan A. Courtin F. Virion A. Dupuy C. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1574-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4.Friedman J.E. Watson Jr., J.A. Lam D.W. Rokita S.E. J. Biol.

However, deletion of its N-terminal membrane anchor yields a soluble and active enzyme (6.Watson Jr., J.A. McTamney P.M. Adler J.M. Rokita S.E. ChemBioChem. 2008; 9: 504-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) that has been expressed in Sf9 cells in sufficient quantities to support the crystallographic analysis reported here. Wild-type Mus musculus IYD cDNA (I.M.A.G.E. clone 5061638) was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and amplified with primers 5′-AAGCTTAAGCTTGGATCCGCCACCATGGCTCAAGTTCAGCCC-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGCTCGAGCTAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGTACTGTCACCATGATC-3′ to generate a derivative lacking codons for amino acids 2–33 and gaining codons for a C-terminal His6 tag. The amplified product and pFASTBAC1 (Invitrogen) were digested with BamHI and XhoI, ligated together, and transformed into One Shot Top10 cells. DNA was isolated from colonies resistant to ampicillin and sequenced to verify the desired gene sequence (IYD(ΔTM)His6). Bacmid containing IYD(ΔTM)His6 was generated through transposition of pFASTBAC1-IYD(ΔTM)His6 into the baculovirus shuttle vector bMON14272 according to the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system protocols provided by Invitrogen. Sf9 cells adapted to SF-900 II SFM (Invitrogen) were transfected with the pFASTBAC1-IYD(ΔTM)His6 recombinant bacmid DNA and Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen). The resulting recombinant baculovirus was collected from the growth medium 72 h after transfection. The virus was then amplified with a multiplicity of infection of 0.05 (plaque-forming unit/cell) as directed by the Bac-to-Bac protocols, and virus concentration was determined by standard end point dilution analysis (13.O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: a Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, Inc., New York1994: 130-134Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were infected by pFASTBAC1-IYD(ΔTM)His6 recombinant baculovirus stock in SF-900 II SFM with a multiplicity of infection of 1 (plaque-forming unit/cell). Cells were incubated at 27 °C for 72 h and then harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min (room temperature). The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0 and lysed by three freezing and thawing cycles followed by three passages through a 20-gauge needle. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h (4 °C). The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane and then loaded onto a HisTrap HP column (1 ml) with chelated Ni2+. The column was washed with 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0 (5 ml) and then eluted with a linear gradient of increasing imidazole (20–300 mm; 20 ml). Fractions containing the desired protein were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4 (4 °C). Protein solutions were stored at 4 °C without loss of catalytic activity for at least 4 weeks. Initial crystallization was explored with sparse matrix screening (WizardTM I, II, and III (Emerald Biosciences); PEGSuiteTM and CryoSuiteTM (Qiagen); and NatrixTM and IndexTM (Hampton Research)) using an Art Robbins Phoenix high throughput liquid handler. Ultimately IYD was crystallized at 20 °C in three different crystal forms by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using two parts IYD (16 mg/ml; 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4) to one part reservoir solution. IYD crystals were obtained using a reservoir solution containing 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000, and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5. IYD·MIT co-crystals were obtained by supplementing the enzyme solution with 2 mm MIT prior to addition of the reservoir solution containing 0.2 m magnesium chloride, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. IYD·DIT co-crystals were obtained by supplementing the enzyme solution with 2 mm DIT prior to addition of the reservoir solution containing 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 45% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.1 m BisTris, pH 5.5. In each case, yellow crystals appeared within 24 h. Initial crystals were screened for diffraction and cryo conditions using a Bruker Microstar H2 generator with Proteum Pt135 CCD detector at 100 K. Diffraction data sets were then collected at the Northeastern Collaborative Access Team Beamline 24-ID, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratories. Diffraction data for IYD(ΔTM)His6 was collected at a wavelength of 1.653 Å for single anomalous diffraction phasing using sulfur atoms. Diffraction data of co-crystals containing MIT and DIT alternatively were collected at 0.9795 Å. All collected data were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (14.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). All nine sulfur positions within IYD(ΔTM)His6 were found using HKL2MAP (15.Pape T. Schneider T.R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 843-844Crossref Google Scholar). Heavy atom positions were refined, and initial phases were determined using the AUTOSHARP program set (16.Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). Initial model building was performed by WARP within AUTOSHARP. Because of the complexity of the monomeric fold, nearly half of the residues were not built and required manual building. Several rounds of model building and refinement were needed for IYD(ΔTM)His6 using Refmac5 with TLS refinement and COOT for molecular visualization and rebuilding (17.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar, 18.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). A monomer of IYD(ΔTM)His6 was used as a model for molecular replacement to solve the structure of the co-crystal containing MIT. One dimer of this co-crystal was used in turn as the model for molecular replacement to solve the co-crystal containing DIT. Molecular replacement was performed by PHASER within the CCP4 program suite (19.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14771) Google Scholar, 20.Collaborative Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). These structures were also rebuilt and refined by iterations of Refmac5 and COOT.

Open table in a new tab In the absence of the N-terminal membrane anchor, IYD becomes a soluble enzyme (6.Watson Jr., J.A. McTamney P.M. Adler J.M. Rokita S.E. ChemBioChem. 2008; 9: 504-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A suitably truncated form of the IYD gene (M. musculus) encoding residues 33–285 (IYD(ΔTM)His6) was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified by nickel-based affinity chromatography. The resulting protein was screened for crystallization, and crystals were obtained for IYD alone and IYD containing its substrates MIT and DIT alternatively. In the absence of substrate, IYD crystallized with one monomer per asymmetric unit. However, analysis of the crystal packing interactions revealed an extensive interface with a symmetry-related molecule (2490 Å2 per monomer) indicating that the enzyme forms a domain-swapped dimer as observed in related proteins within the same structural superfamily (4.Friedman J.E. Watson Jr., J.A. Lam D.W. Rokita S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2812-2819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21.Tu S.C. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 881-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The IYD·MIT complex crystallized with two monomers per asymmetric unit, and the IYD·DIT complex crystallized with eight monomers per asymmetric unit. All three structures were solved from distinct crystal forms (Table 1). Electron density for the first 34 amino acids of the truncated enzyme IYD(ΔTM)His6 was not observed for any of the three crystals. These residues in the native protein likely provide a flexible linker between the soluble domain and the N-terminal anchor embedded in the membrane. IYD contains the characteristic α-β fold that is common to all proteins of the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase superfamily (Fig. 2). The closest structural neighbor to IYD as determined by DaliLite (22.Holm L. Park J. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 566-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) is BluB (Protein Data Bank code 2ISK) (23.Taga M.E. Larsen N.A. Howard-Jones A.R. Walsh C.T. Walker G.C. Nature. 2007; 446: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) with an root mean square deviation of 3.1 Å for 198 structurally equivalent residues of 219 possible residues. Despite the structural similarities, their sequence identity is quite low (19%). The net catalytic turnover of BluB appears to be very different from IYD, and BluB has been recently identified as the source of the lower ligand of vitamin B12 by sacrificing its bound FMN cofactor to oxidation (23.Taga M.E. Larsen N.A. Howard-Jones A.R. Walsh C.T. Walker G.C. Nature. 2007; 446: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Still IYD and BluB form similar dimer interfaces at their core with criss-crossing helices and similar domain swaps with their extended N- and C-terminal fingers. Neither enzyme conforms well to the existing subcategories within their superfamily (21.Tu S.C. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 881-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), although they do retain many protein-FMN interactions common to the superfamily and additionally share a few unique interactions as discussed below. The dimer interface is highly conserved among the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase superfamily. One helix of the α-β fold of each monomer assembles together to form the central interface of IYD. Domain swapping within IYD is also consistent with the superfamily. For IYD, N- and C-terminal extensions of each polypeptide wrap around the other. These extensions span distances of greater than 37 Å and comprise a minimum of 26 amino acids near the N terminus and 18 amino acids at the C-terminus. Two equivalent active sites are located within the dimer interface, and each active site is comprised of residues from both subunits. Accordingly subunit association is essential for FMN binding and catalytic activity. Because the IYD structure was solved as a monomer per asymmetric unit, its dimer was generated by crystallographic symmetry, and consequently no differences between the two monomers were observed. Differences observed between the monomeric units of IYD·MIT and IYD·DIT were minimal as evident from their root mean square deviation values of 0.196 and 0.254 Å, respectively. Two unstructured regions were identified within substrate-free IYD by the lack of electron density corresponding to residues 156–177 and 195–208. Even in the substrate-bound co-crystals, the regions containing residues 195–208 exhibit relatively weak electron density compared with other regions of the molecule. Only portions of this region, some with higher than average B-factors, could be built for IYD bound to substrate. In contrast, residues 156–177 gain detectable structure based on the additional electron density observed for the co-crystals IYD·MIT and IYD·DIT. Substrate binding appears to induce the extension of one helix (αC) and the formation of another short helix (αD) in this region to cover the active site and protect substrate and flavin from solvent (Fig. 2, B and D). This active site lid is stabilized in part by numerous interactions with the bound substrate that is in turn anchored by aromatic stacking with the isoalloxazine ring of FMN as well as by polar contacts with FMN and Ala-126 (described below) (Fig. 2E). Eight residues of the lid assemble within 4 Å of the substrate, and three of these form polar contacts (Glu-153, Tyr-157, and Lys-178). Noncovalent recognition of halogen substituents has recently been featured in a review describing halogen bonds in analogy to hydrogen bonds (24.Metrangolo P. Meyer F. Pilati T. Resnati G. Terraneo G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2008; 47: 6114-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). Such bonding typically involves electron donation from a lone pair of electrons contributed by an oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur atom to a halogen and, in particular, to highly polarizable iodine. The environment surrounding the iodine of MIT by 4 Å is primarily nonpolar and consists of the β-carbon of Tyr-207, α-carbon of Gly-125, and two aromatic carbons of Tyr-208. The aromatic ring of Tyr-208 interacts edge-on with the iodine and precludes interaction with its aromatic π-electrons (25.Matter H. Nazaré M. Güssregen S. Will D.W. Schreuder H. Bauer A. Urmann M. Ritter K. Wagner M. Wehner V. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2009; 48: 2911-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In contrast, the π-system of the isoalloxazine ring defines one surface of the substrate binding pocket. Potential donors for a halogen bond are present but remain slightly out of range (farther than 3.5 Å) and not optimally oriented for the most favorable C–I···N/O angle of 130–180° (26.Auffinger P. Hays F.A. Westhof E. Ho P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 16789-16794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 27.Cody V. Murray-Rust P. J. Mol. Struct. 1984; 112: 189-199Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The amide nitrogen of Ala-126 and indole nitrogen of Trp-165 are 3.57 and 3.99 Å from the iodine, respectively, and form angles with the C–I bond of 93° and 81°. Still the distances are at least consistent with those observed by crystallography to surround the iodine substituent of a thyroxine mimic bound to transthyretin (28.Gales L. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Arsequell G. Valencia G. Saraiva M.J. Damas A.M. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The next closest polar atoms, the N-5 of the isoalloxazine ring and the amide nitrogen of Tyr-208, are even farther from the iodine at 4.10 and 5.82 Å, respectively. Perhaps most importantly, the C-4a of the isoalloxazine ring closely approaches the carbon bearing the iodine (3.65 Å; Fig. 2F) and provides a likely path for electron transfer during reductive deiodination. Many of the contacts between the phosphoribose component of FMN and IYD are relatively common to flavoproteins in general and especially representative of the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase superfamily (29.Parkinson G.N. Skelly J.V. Neidle S. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 3624-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For example, the phosphate group is coordinated within the protein interior by multiple arginines, which in the case of IYD are Arg-96, Arg-97, and Arg-275. Additionally a variety of serine hydroxyl groups provide hydrogen bonding to the ribityl hydroxyl groups as evident with Ser-98 and Ser-124 of IYD. The pyrimidine ring of the isoalloxazine system typically associates with a number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors of the protein active site. Such interactions are crucial for modulating the chemistry of the cofactor and optimizing catalysis (30.Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 31.Legrand Y.M. Gray M. Cooke G. Rotello V.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 15789-15795Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32.Lyubimov A.Y. Lario P.I. Moustafa I. Vrielink A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The role of substrate coordination to the pyrimidine ring of FMN is unique to IYD. Both the α-ammonium and carboxylate groups of MIT interact with the N-3 and O4 of isoalloxazine (Fig. 2E). The zwitterionic nature of the substrate is thus essential for controlling the chemistry of the flavin cofactor as well as securing the active site lid. Close association between the phenolic hydroxyl group of MIT and a ribityl hydroxyl group of FMN (2.55 Å; Fig. 2F) adds an additional contact to the considerable interplay between substrate and cofactor and is also likely essential for catalysis as presented in the discussion section. The phenolic hydroxyl group additionally interacts with the backbone nitrogen of Ala-126 providing yet another substrate-mediated bridge between protein and FMN. Flavoproteins collectively catalyze a highly diverse set of reactions. Even within structural subfamilies, the diversity of catalysis can be broad. Flavoproteins of the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase superfamily are characterized by an α-β fold and subunit dimerization stabilized by an extensive protein-protein interface and domain swapping (Fig. 2, A and B). Most representatives of this superfamily promote oxidation of NAD(P)H (29.Parkinson G.N. Skelly J.V. Neidle S. J. Med.

Biol. 2001; 309: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The ultimate acceptors of the reducing equivalents are far more varied and in many cases not yet defined in vivo. Some representatives such as flavin reductase P (FRP) generate reduced flavin required for bioluminescence (33.Tanner J.J. Lei B. Tu S.C. Krause K.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13531-13539Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Other representatives reduce nitroaromatic compounds and quinones that may play a critical role in activation and deactivation of drugs and pollutants (29.Parkinson G.N. Skelly J.V. Neidle S. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 3624-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 34.Haynes C.A. Koder R.L. Miller A.F. Rodgers D.W. J. Biol.

These nitroreductases are oxygen-insensitive suggesting an obligate two-electron transfer from the reduced flavoprotein to the nitroaromatic substrate. Until recently, all representatives of this structural superfamily belonged to one of two subclasses represented here by NADH oxidase from Thermus thermophilus (35.Hecht H.J. Erdmann H. Park H.J. Sprinzl M. Schmid R.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1109-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and FRP from Vibrio harveyi (33.Tanner J.J. Lei B. Tu S.C. Krause K.L.

https://openalex.org/W1983328847,"Background Norepinephrine (NE) modulates the responsiveness of macrophages to proinflammatory stimuli through the activation of adrenergic receptors (ARs). Being part of the stress response, early increases of NE in sepsis sustain adverse systemic inflammatory responses. The intestine is an important source of NE release in the early stage of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis in rats, which then stimulates TNF-α production in Kupffer cells (KCs) through the activation of the α2-AR. It is important to know which of the three α2-AR subtypes (i.e., α2A, α2B or α2C) is responsible for the upregulation of TNF-α production. The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of α2A-AR in this process. Methodology/Principal Findings Adult male rats underwent CLP and KCs were isolated 2 h later. Gene expression of α2A-AR was determined. In additional experiments, cultured KCs were incubated with NE with or without BRL-44408 maleate, a specific α2A-AR antagonist, and intraportal infusion of NE for 2 h with or without BRL-44408 maleate was carried out in normal animals. Finally, the impact of α2A-AR activation by NE was investigated under inflammatory conditions (i.e., endotoxemia and CLP). Gene expression of the α2A-AR subtype was significantly upregulated after CLP. NE increased the release of TNF-α in cultured KCs, which was specifically inhibited by the α2A-AR antagonist BRL-44408. Equally, intraportal NE infusion increased TNF-α gene expression in KCs and plasma TNF-α which was also abrogated by co-administration of BRL-44408. NE also potentiated LPS-induced TNF-α release via the α2A-AR in vitro and in vivo. This potentiation of TNF-α release by NE was mediated through the α2A-AR coupled Gαi protein and the activation of the p38 MAP kinase. Treatment of septic animals with BRL-44408 suppressed TNF-α, prevented multiple organ injury and significantly improved survival from 45% to 75%. Conclusions/Significance Our novel finding is that hyperresponsiveness to α2-AR stimulation observed in sepsis is primarily due to an increase in α2A-AR expression in KCs. This appears to be in part responsible for the increased proinflammatory response and ensuing organ injury in sepsis. These findings provide important feasibility information for further developing the α2A-AR antagonist as a new therapy for sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2056818511,"Overexpression and/or amplification of the ErbB-2 oncogene as well as inactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor are two important genetic events in human breast carcinogenesis. To address the biological impact of conditional inactivation of PTEN on ErbB-2-induced mammary tumorigenesis, we generated a novel transgenic mouse model that utilizes the murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter to directly couple expression of activated ErbB-2 and Cre recombinase to the same mammary epithelial cell (MMTV-NIC). Disruption of PTEN in the mammary epithelium of the MMTV-NIC model system dramatically accelerated the formation of multifocal and highly metastatic mammary tumors, which exhibited homogenous pathology. PTEN-deficient/NIC-induced tumorigenesis was associated with an increase in angiogenesis. Moreover, inactivation of PTEN in the MMTV-NIC mouse model resulted in hyperactivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. However, like the parental strain, tumors obtained from PTEN-deficient/NIC mice displayed histopathological and molecular features of the luminal subtype of primary human breast cancer. Taken together, our findings provide important implications in understanding the molecular determinants of mammary tumorigenesis driven by PTEN deficiency and ErbB-2 activation and could provide a valuable tool for testing the efficacy of therapeutic strategies that target these critical signaling pathways. Overexpression and/or amplification of the ErbB-2 oncogene as well as inactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor are two important genetic events in human breast carcinogenesis. To address the biological impact of conditional inactivation of PTEN on ErbB-2-induced mammary tumorigenesis, we generated a novel transgenic mouse model that utilizes the murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter to directly couple expression of activated ErbB-2 and Cre recombinase to the same mammary epithelial cell (MMTV-NIC). Disruption of PTEN in the mammary epithelium of the MMTV-NIC model system dramatically accelerated the formation of multifocal and highly metastatic mammary tumors, which exhibited homogenous pathology. PTEN-deficient/NIC-induced tumorigenesis was associated with an increase in angiogenesis. Moreover, inactivation of PTEN in the MMTV-NIC mouse model resulted in hyperactivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. However, like the parental strain, tumors obtained from PTEN-deficient/NIC mice displayed histopathological and molecular features of the luminal subtype of primary human breast cancer. Taken together, our findings provide important implications in understanding the molecular determinants of mammary tumorigenesis driven by PTEN deficiency and ErbB-2 activation and could provide a valuable tool for testing the efficacy of therapeutic strategies that target these critical signaling pathways. Genetic alterations in the normal mammary epithelium, including the activation of oncogenes and the loss of function of tumor suppressor genes, have been implicated in the induction of mammary tumors.

Amplification/overexpression of ErbB-2 has been observed in 20–30% of human breast cancers, correlating with poor patient prognosis (2.Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A.

Schade B. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), where engagement of the ErbB-2 receptor results in the recruitment of adaptor proteins, activating primarily the Ras pathway (5.Dankort D.L.

ErbB-3 mediates activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway by recruiting the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (7.Prigent S.A. Gullick W.J.

Additionally, the ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimer is thought to be the most biologically active and pro-tumorigenic receptor complex (9.Alimandi M. Romano A. Curia M.C. Muraro R. Fedi P. Aaronson S.A.

These findings suggest that the concerted activation of both Ras and PI3K signaling through this EGFR family heterodimer plays a critical role in mammary tumorigenesis (9.Alimandi M. Romano A.

Growth and survival pathways can also become oncogenic through the disruption of tumor suppressors. Loss of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) due to mutation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and epigenetic down-modulation has been reported in about 50% of human cancers, including breast cancer (11.Salmena L. Carracedo A. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2008; 133: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). PTEN, a lipid phosphatase, directly antagonizes the proto-oncogenic PI3K/Akt pathway by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate to generate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to attenuate Akt activation (12.Maehama T.

Collectively, these observations suggest that cross-talk between ErbB-2 and PTEN disruption may play a critical role in ErbB-2-induced tumorigenesis. To directly assess the role of PTEN in ErbB-2-induced mammary tumorigenesis, we recently interbred conditional PTEN mice to a mouse model expressing a Cre-inducible activated ErbB-2 allele under the transcriptional control of the endogenous ErbB-2 promoter (ErbB-2KI) (20.Dourdin N. Schade B. Lesurf R. Hallett M. Munn R.J. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 2122-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PTEN deficiency dramatically accelerated ErbB-2-mediated tumorigenesis. About 50% of PTEN-heterozygous/ErbB-2KI tumors displayed LOH at the PTEN locus. PTEN-deficient/ErbB-2KI tumors displayed elevated ErbB-2 protein levels, like the parental strain, but this was not due to genomic amplification or dramatically increased ErbB-2 transcription (20.Dourdin N. Schade B. Lesurf R. Hallett M. Munn R.J. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 2122-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Strikingly, PTEN-deficient/ErbB-2KI tumors showed morphological heterogeneity with molecular and pathological features of the basal-like and HER2 subtypes of human breast cancer. One limitation of the PTEN-deficient/ErbB-2KI model is that ErbB-2 expression is driven by the endogenous ErbB-2 promoter (21.Andrechek E.R. Hardy W.R. Siegel P.M. Rudnicki M.A. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3444-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, initial ErbB-2 transcription in these mammary epithelial cells is low, and therefore, PTEN inactivation occurs before elevated ErbB-2 levels. To directly evaluate the functional consequences of PTEN disruption in a mouse model that places ErbB-2 under transcriptional control of the strong viral MMTV promoter, we have generated mice co-expressing activated ErbB-2 (6.Siegel P.M. Ryan E.D. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Embo J. 1999; 18: 2149-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and Cre recombinase from the same bicistronic transcript, due to an internal ribosome entry sequence placed between the two cDNA sequences (MMTV-NIC) (22.Ursini-Siegel J. Hardy W.R. Zuo D. Lam S.H. Sanguin-Gendreau V. Cardiff R.D. Pawson T. Muller W.J. Embo J. 2008; 27: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This system couples ErbB-2 and Cre recombinase expression within the same mammary epithelial cell (supplemental Fig. 1A). Using this approach we demonstrate that homozygous inactivation of PTEN in the presence of constitutive ErbB-2 expression results in a dramatic acceleration of mammary tumor onset in MMTV-NIC mice. PTEN-deficient/NIC tumor cells exhibit increased capacity to colonize the lung, correlating with elevated angiogenesis in the primary tumors. Furthermore, over 50% of PTEN heterozygous/NIC tumors displayed LOH at the PTEN locus. In contrast to the morphological heterogeneity of the PTEN-deficient/ErbB-2KI tumors, PTEN loss in MMTV-NIC mice results in mammary tumors with a homogenous morphology resembling the parental strain. Unlike the PTEN-deficient/ErbB-2KI model, PTEN-deficient/NIC mammary tumorigenesis is associated with the loss of basal/myoepithelial markers, leading to rapid formation of invasive tumors with histopathological and molecular characteristics of the luminal subtype. Biochemical analysis revealed that loss of PTEN in MMTV-NIC tumors results in hyperactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Consequently, this novel ErbB-2 mouse model may provide valuable insights toward understanding the molecular determinants in mammary tumor progression and represents an attractive tool for testing the efficacy of therapeutic strategies directed against the PI3K/Akt network in combination with receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Mice harboring a bicistronic transcript expressing an oncogenic Neu allele (6.Siegel P.M. Ryan E.D. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Embo J. 1999; 18: 2149-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) followed by an internal ribosome entry sequence element and Cre recombinase under the control of the MMTV promoter have been described (22.Ursini-Siegel J.

Paraffin sections of 5 μm were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Step sections of lungs (4 × 50 μm) were scanned using a Scanscope XT Digital Slide Scanner (Aperio) and analyzed at 5× magnification using Imagescope software (Aperio) to quantify the total number of lesions per lung. The data are shown as the average number of lesions per lung lobe. Immunohistochemical staining was performed as described (24.White D.E. Kurpios N.A. Zuo D. Hassell J.A. Blaess S. Mueller U.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10000) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. DNA was obtained from tumors and examined for LOH at the PTEN locus as described (21.Andrechek E.R. Hardy W.R. Siegel P.M. Rudnicki M.A. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Two RNA pools containing equal amounts of total RNA from five individual MMTV-NIC tumors were generated and functioned as a biological repeat. Labeled aRNA (750 ng) was hybridized against a Universal Mouse Reference RNA (Stratagene) onto Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarrays (G4122A; 44K). Duplicate hybridizations were done for all samples using reverse-dye labeling.

Overrepresented GO and KEGG categories were computed by means of a standard hypergeometric test on the set of genes overexpressed in a group of samples and was carried out using the GOstats package (30.Falcon S. Gentleman R. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 257-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). For the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), genes were ranked using the program's built-in algorithm, with 1000 permutations (31.Mootha V.K. Lindgren C.M. Eriksson K.F. Subramanian A. Sihag S.

Symbols in all gene sets were translated from human to mouse using biomaRt (33.Durinck S. Moreau Y. Kasprzyk A. Davis S. De Moor B. Brazma A. Huber W. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3439-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). All unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed using the Pearson correlation as a distance measure and with Ward's minimum variance agglomeration method. Integration of separate datasets was made by subtracting log2 ratios from normal tissue and scaling each gene to ∼N (0,1) within and across all samples within the dataset. We recently generated a mouse model where expression of activated ErbB-2 and Cre recombinase are coupled within the same mammary epithelial cell (22.Ursini-Siegel J. Hardy W.R. Zuo D. Lam S.H. Sanguin-Gendreau V. Cardiff R.D. Pawson T. Muller W.J. Embo J. 2008; 27: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To determine the biological significance of heterozygous or homozygous PTEN loss in MMTV-NIC-induced mammary tumorigenesis, we interbred MMTV-NIC animals with mice carrying one or two floxed PTEN alleles (PTEN−/−, PTEN+/−). Thus, both ErbB-2 expression and loss of PTEN will occur simultaneously in each mammary epithelial cell in these bigenic animals. Cohorts of PTEN−/−/NIC, PTEN+/−/NIC, and MMTV-NIC virgin females were generated and monitored for mammary tumor formation by weekly palpation. Homozygous inactivation of PTEN resulted in dramatic acceleration of tumor onset with an average latency of 43 days, whereas heterozygous PTEN loss exhibited a moderate acceleration (126 days) compared with that of 198 days obtained for the parental strain (Fig. 1A, left panel; Table 1). All genotypes developed multifocal mammary tumors with 100% penetrance (Table 1). Four weeks after initial tumor detection, all tumor-bearing animals were sacrificed, the total tumor volume was determined, and lungs were harvested. The average total tumor burden was not significantly elevated in the PTEN-deficient/NIC mice relative to the MMTV-NIC (Fig. 1A, right panel). Conversely, the average tumor volume per tumor was greater in the parental strain compared with the PTEN−/−/NIC (supplemental Fig. 1B). These observations are reflective of the fact that the PTEN−/−/NIC mice developed on average more individual but smaller tumor nodules relative to the MMTV-NIC mice.TABLE 1Phenotypic characteristics of the PTEN-deficient/ErbB-2 mouse modelsStrainPromoter (activated ErbB-2)Average age of mammary tumor formationaValues represent the average age of onset in days of first palpable mammary tumor.Penetrance of tumorsbPercentage of animals that developed mammary tumors.Mammary tumor morphology% of animals with lung lesionscPercentage of tumor-bearing animals that possessed lung lesions; parentheses indicate the numbers of animals with lung lesions over the number of examined animals.% of mammary tumors with PTEN lossdPercentage of tumor-bearing animals showing a reduced amount of PTEN by Southern blot analysis.Days%PTEN+/−/NICMMTV126 (±36)100Multifocal, solid nodular53 (10/19)80PTEN−/−/NICMMTV43 (±12)100Multifocal, solid nodular87.5 (14/16)100MMTV-NICMMTV198 (±43)100Multifocal, solid nodular56 (5/9)NDPTEN+/−/ErbB-2KI (20)Endogenous212 (±92)10050% focal, 50% multifocal heterogeneous morphology35 (6/17)56PTEN−/−/ErbB-2KI (20)Endogenous138 (±125)10060% focal, 40% multifocal heterogeneous morphology0 (0/6)100ErbB-2KI (21)Endogenous419 (±137)83Focal comedo adenocarcinoma6 (2/35)0PTEN+/− (20)NA410 (±101)7560% focal, 40% multifocal heterogeneous morphology18 (2/11)17PTEN−/− (20)NANA0NANANAa Values represent the average age of onset in days of first palpable mammary tumor.b Percentage of animals that developed mammary tumors.c Percentage of tumor-bearing animals that possessed lung lesions; parentheses indicate the numbers of animals with lung lesions over the number of examined animals.d Percentage of tumor-bearing animals showing a reduced amount of PTEN by Southern blot analysis. Open table in a new tab To assess whether PTEN loss affects the ability of tumor cells to colonize the lung in MMTV-NIC mice, lungs from tumor-bearing females were subjected to histological analyses to detect the presence of lung lesions. Overall, the percentage of mice with lung metastases was increased in the PTEN−/−/NIC (87.5%) compared with PTEN+/−/NIC mice (53%) and the parental strain (56%) (Fig. 1B, left panel). Interestingly, we found a significant increase in the average number of lung lesions in the PTEN-deficient/NIC mice (2 metastases/lung lobe) relative to the parental strain (0.6 metastases/lung lobe) (Fig. 1B, right panel). Histological assessment of PTEN-deficient/NIC-derived mammary tumors revealed a morphology similar to that observed in MMTV-NIC tumors. Unlike the morphological heterogeneity observed in the PTEN-deficient/ErbB-2KI mouse model (20.Dourdin N. Schade B. Lesurf R. Hallett M. Munn R.J. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 2122-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the PTEN-deficient/NIC-derived tumors are composed of large nodular nests with central necrosis that resemble the parental tumors (Fig. 1C). Moreover, a histological survey of adjacent mammary glands from tumor-bearing mice revealed that 81% of the MMTV-NIC adjacent mammary gland structures represent relatively normal ducts/acini, whereas 1% categorize as early mammary intraepithelial neoplasms (MINs), 8% as hyperplasia and 10% as ectasia (supplemental Fig. 1C). In comparison, PTEN-deficient/NIC adjacent mammary glands contained only 38% relatively normal ducts/acini, 8% early MINs, 20% hyperplasia, and 34% ectasia, suggesting that PTEN inactivation may result in increased numbers of pre-neoplastic structures associated with early stages of tumorigenesis (supplemental Fig. 1C). Collectively, these observations suggest that impairment of PTEN has a dramatic impact on both tumor initiation and metastatic potential in ErbB-2-mediated mammary tumorigenesis. Given that PTEN inactivation in our MMTV-driven ErbB-2 mouse model has a significant impact on mammary tumor initiation (Fig. 1A), we next determined whether tumor cell proliferation was affected. Serial tumor sections were subjected to immunohistochemical staining with the proliferative marker Ki67. This survey revealed that PTEN-deficient tumors possessed similar proliferative levels compared with their wild type counterparts (Fig. 2A). However, analysis of adjacent mammary glands from both genotypes displayed a moderate increase in Ki67-positive nuclei within early MINs and hyperplasia of the PTEN-deficient/NIC mice when compared with the parental strain (Fig. 2A). One interesting feature of PTEN-deficient mammary tumors is their increased capacity to metastasize to the lung (Fig. 1B, right panel). To determine whether the enhanced metastatic phenotype was related to increased angiogenesis, we performed CD31 immunohistochemical staining to score for blood vessels on mammary tumors from each genotype. Microvessel density is reflected by the percentage of CD31-positive endothelium per area of tumor epithelium and can be used as an indicator of increased angiogenesis. Immunohistochemical examination of CD31 staining revealed that tumors obtained from PTEN-deficient/NIC females displayed significantly increased angiogenesis relative to MMTV-NIC-derived tumors (Fig. 2B). Our findings suggest that the dramatic effect of PTEN inactivation on ErbB-2-mediated mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis may be due to increased tumor angiogenesis. Histopathological surveys of PTEN-deficient/NIC and MMTV-NIC adjacent mammary glands revealed that early MINs, hyperplasia, and relatively normal ducts/acini, stained intensely for basal/myoepithelial markers including smooth muscle actin, Krt5, Krt14 (34.Lazard D.

https://openalex.org/W2080309793,"PIK3CA, which codes for the p110α catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), is implicated as an oncogene. Despite importance of PIK3CA in cancer, little is known about what drives up its expression in tumor cells. We recently characterized the PIK3CA promoter and reported that it is transcriptionally silenced by the tumor suppressor protein p53. In the present study, we demonstrate that PIK3CA can be induced by the oncogenic transcription factor Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1). Three YB-1-responsive elements were identified on the PIK3CA promoter using chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Interestingly, silencing YB-1 with siRNA in models of basal-like breast cancer decreased p110α protein levels regardless of whether PIK3CA was wild type, amplified or mutated. This decrease in p110α led to a reduction in PI3K activity and the downstream signaling primarily through p90 ribosomal S6 kinase and S6 ribosomal protein. Disruption in PIK3CA-dependent signaling suppressed cellular invasion correlative with loss of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). Similarly, silencing YB-1 suppressed invasion and uPA production however this was reversible through the introduction of constitutively active PIK3CA. In conclusion, YB-1 is the first reported oncogene to induce the expression of PIK3CA through transcriptional control of its promoter."

We created mice with a targeted deletion of IP6K2; these mice display normal embryogenesis, development, growth and fertility. Chronic exposure to the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO, a UV-mimetic compound) in drinking water resulted in fourfold increased incidence of invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) formation in the oral cavity and esophagus of the knockout (KO) mice compared to the wild-type (WT) littermates. Paradoxically, KO mice displayed relative resistance to ionizing radiation and exhibit enhanced survival following 8-10 Gy total body irradiation. Primary KO fibroblasts displayed resistance to antiproliferative effects of interferon-beta and increased colony forming units following ionizing radiation. Radioresistance of KO fibroblasts was associated with accelerated DNA repair measured by comet assay. Direct microinjection of 5-PP-Ins(1,2,3,4,6)P(5) (the enzymatic product of IP6K2), but not InsP(6) (the substrate of IP6K2) induced cell death in SCC22A squamous carcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2082559655,"Canonical Wnt signaling regulates many aspects of cellular physiology and tissue homeostasis during development and in adult organisms. In molecular terms, stimulation by Wnt ligands leads to the stabilization of beta-catenin, its translocation to the nucleus, and stimulation of TCF (T-cell factor)-dependent transcription of target genes. This process is controlled at various stages by a number of regulatory proteins, including transcriptional activators and repressors. Here we demonstrate that the endosomal proteins APPL1 and APPL2 are novel activators of beta-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription. APPL proteins are multifunctional adaptors and effectors of the small GTPase Rab5, which localize to a subpopulation of early endosomes but are also capable of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Overexpression of APPL1 or APPL2 protein stimulates the activity of beta-catenin/TCF-dependent reporter construct, whereas silencing of APPL1 reduces it. Both APPL proteins interact directly with Reptin, a transcriptional repressor binding to beta-catenin and HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1), and this interaction was mapped to the pleckstrin homology domain of APPL1. Moreover, APPL proteins are present in an endogenous complex containing Reptin, beta-catenin, HDAC1, and HDAC2. Overexpression of either APPL protein relieves Reptin-dependent transcriptional repression and correlates with the reduced amounts of HDACs and beta-catenin associated with Reptin as well as with the lower levels of Reptin and HDAC1 on the promoters of beta-catenin target genes. We propose that APPL proteins exert their stimulatory effects on beta-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription by decreasing the activity of a Reptin-containing repressive complex."
https://openalex.org/W2140942543,"Mutations in the ELG1 gene of yeast lead to genomic instability, manifested in high levels of genetic recombination, chromosome loss, and gross chromosomal rearrangements. Elg1 shows similarity to the large subunit of the Replication Factor C clamp loader, and forms a RFC-like (RLC) complex in conjunction with the 4 small RFC subunits. Two additional RLCs exist in yeast: in one of them the large subunit is Ctf18, and in the other, Rad24. Ctf18 has been characterized as the RLC that functions in sister chromatid cohesion. Here we present evidence that the Elg1 RLC (but not Rad24) also plays an important role in this process. A genetic screen identified the cohesin subunit Mcd1/Scc1 and its loader Scc2 as suppressors of the synthetic lethality between elg1 and ctf4. We describe genetic interactions between ELG1 and genes encoding cohesin subunits and their accessory proteins. We also show that defects in Elg1 lead to higher precocious sister chromatid separation, and that Ctf18 and Elg1 affect cohesion via a joint pathway. Finally, we localize both Ctf18 and Elg1 to chromatin and show that Elg1 plays a role in the recruitment of Ctf18. Our results suggest that Elg1, Ctf4, and Ctf18 may coordinate the relative movement of the replication fork with respect to the cohesin ring."
https://openalex.org/W2106083621,"Mouse models have shown the importance of acidic mammalian chitinase activity in settings of chitin exposure and allergic inflammation. However, little is known regarding genetic regulation of AMCase enzymatic activity in human allergic diseases. Resequencing the AMCase gene exons we identified 8 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms including three novel variants (A290G, G296A, G339T) near the gene area coding for the enzyme active site, all in linkage disequilibrium. AMCase protein isoforms, encoded by two gene-wide haplotypes, and differentiated by these three single nucleotide polymorphisms, were recombinantly expressed and purified. Biochemical analysis revealed the isoform encoded by the variant haplotype displayed a distinct pH profile exhibiting greater retention of chitinase activity at acidic and basic pH values. Determination of absolute kinetic activity found the variant isoform encoded by the variant haplotype was 4-, 2.5-, and 10-fold more active than the wild type AMCase isoform at pH 2.2, 4.6, and 7.0, respectively. Modeling of the AMCase isoforms revealed positional changes in amino acids critical for both pH specificity and substrate binding. Genetic association analyses of AMCase haplotypes for asthma revealed significant protective associations between the variant haplotype in several asthma cohorts. The structural, kinetic, and genetic data regarding the AMCase isoforms are consistent with the Th2-priming effects of environmental chitin and a role for AMCase in negatively regulating this stimulus."

Actin microfilaments are formed from polymerization of actin monomers and are a major component of the cytoskeleton. In plant cells, actin microfilaments are arranged in longitudinal arrays of thick actin bundles with randomly oriented thin actin filaments extending from the bundles (1.Higaki T. Sano T. Hasezawa S. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2007; 10: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts are either aligned along the actin bundles or closely associated with the fine filaments and are surrounded by baskets of actin microfilaments (1.Higaki T. Sano T. Hasezawa S. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2007; 10: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 2.Kandasamy M.K. Meagher R.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A direct interaction of chloroplasts with the actin cytoskeleton has been postulated to anchor chloroplasts at appropriate intracellular positions (3.Kumatani T. Sakurai-Ozato N. Miyawaki N. Yokota E. Shimmen T. Terashima I. Takagi S. Protoplasma. 2006; 229: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Chloroplast movement depends on cytosolic actin filaments and is stimulated by high light intensity (4.Suetsugu N. Wada M. Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A chloroplast envelope protein involved in blue light-dependent chloroplast repositioning has been identified by the analysis of the Arabidopsis chup1 (chloroplast unusual positioning 1) mutant, which was unable to relocate its chloroplasts under high light stimulation (5.Oikawa K. Kasahara M. Kiyosue T. Kagawa T. Suetsugu N. Takahashi F. Kanegae T. Niwa Y. Kadota A. Wada M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2805-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). CHUP1 is a protein exclusively targeted to the chloroplast outer envelope membrane that is essential for chloroplast anchorage to the plasma membrane (6.Oikawa K. Yamasato A. Kong S.G. Kasahara M. Nakai M. Takahashi F. Ogura Y. Kagawa T. Wada M. Plant Physiol. 2008; 148: 829-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). CHUP1 interacts with actin and profilin, a modulator of actin polymerization, and it may play a regulatory role in actin polymerization during chloroplast photo-relocation (7.Schmidt von Braun S. Schleiff E. Planta. 2008; 227: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The interaction of amyloplasts with the actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in gravity perception and signal transduction. Several models for the role of the actin cytoskeleton have been proposed (8.Boonsirichai K. Guan C. Chen R. Masson P.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 421-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), but the nature of the interaction is not known. However, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton enhanced sedimentation of amyloplasts and promoted gravitropism (9.Hou G. Mohamalawari D.R. Blancaflor E.B. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1360-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 10.Yamamoto K. Kiss J.Z. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and a role for myosin has been proposed on the basis of inhibitor experiments (11.Palmieri M. Schwind M.A. Steves M.H.H. Edelmann R.E. Kiss J.Z. Physiol. Plant. 2007; 130: 613-626Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton and myosin have also been implicated in plastid stromule movement. Stromules (stroma-filled tubules) are highly dynamic tubular structures extending from the surface of all plastid types (12.Natesan S.K. Sullivan J.A. Gray J.C. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 787-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 13.Hanson M.R. Sattarzadeh A. Plant Cell Environ. 2008; 31: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Stromules are delimited by the inner and outer plastid envelope membranes, which are closely associated (for a review, see Refs. 12.Natesan S.K. Sullivan J.A. Gray J.C. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 787-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar and 13.Hanson M.R. Sattarzadeh A. Plant Cell Environ. 2008; 31: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Experiments with inhibitors of microfilament- and microtubule-based movement suggested that stromules move along actin microfilaments powered by the ATPase activity of myosin motors (14.Gray J.C. Sullivan J.A. Hibberd J.M. Hansen M.R. Plant Biol. 2001; 3: 223-233Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Physical connection between the envelope membranes seems likely to be required to provide a means of coordinating the movement of the inner envelope membrane with the microfilament-associated outer envelope membrane. There is evidence for direct connection of the inner and outer envelope membranes at contact sites, which support protein translocation through the protein import apparatus (15.Schnell D.J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16.Kessler F. Schnell D.J. Traffic. 2006; 7: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This apparatus consists of two membrane protein complexes that associate to allow translocation of nucleus-encoded proteins from the cytoplasm to the interior stromal compartment (for a review, see 17.Jarvis P.

The translocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts (TIC complex) physically associates with the TOC complex and provides the membrane translocation channel for the inner membrane. In addition, the TOC and TIC complexes interact with a set of molecular chaperones, which assist the transfer of imported proteins (19.Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Components of the TOC-TIC protein import apparatus have been identified by mass spectrometry and Western blotting, and a direct interaction of Escherichia coli-expressed Toc159 with actin was demonstrated by co-sedimentation. This interaction may have a so far unrecognized physiological role in chloroplast protein import. Pea seeds (Pisum sativum Progress no. 9) were obtained from King and Co. Ltd (Kelvedon, Essex, UK) and grown on vermiculite for 13 days at 22 °C in a greenhouse with supplemental lighting giving 275 μmol of photons m−2 s−1. Human platelet non-muscle actin was obtained from Cytoskeleton, Inc. (Denver, CO), and filaments were prepared by incubation for 1 h in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP. Mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against chicken actin (clone C4) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were obtained from GE Healthcare. Antibodies raised against pea chloroplast OEP21 and VIPP1 were provided by Dr. Bölter (Department Biologie I, München, Germany), antibodies against spinach chloroplast IEP37 were provided by Dr. Block (Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique, Grenoble, France), antibodies against pea chloroplast Tic110, AtToc159, and AtToc33 were provided by Dr. Kessler (Université de Neuchâtel, Neuchâtel, Switzerland), and antibodies against pea Toc159, Toc75, and Toc34 were provided by Dr. Schnell (University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA). Plasmids encoding AtToc159, AtToc33G, and AtToc159G fused to GST for expression in E. coli were gifts from Dr. Kessler (Université de Neuchâtel). Intact chloroplasts and chloroplast envelope membranes were isolated from 13-day-old pea seedlings. All operations were carried out at 4 °C. Pea leaves (3 kg) were ground in a Waring blender in 2 liters of grinding buffer (0.3 m sorbitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm α-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.8). The homogenate was filtered through four layers of muslin, and chloroplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 15 min. The chloroplasts were washed twice by resuspension in 400 ml of washing buffer (0.3 m sorbitol, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm α-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 20 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.8) and centrifugation at 3800 × g for 5 min. Intact chloroplasts were isolated by centrifugation through 30-ml Percoll gradients, as described by Cline et al. (22.Cline K. Andrews J. Mersey B. Newcomb E.H. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 3595-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For the isolation of envelope membranes, chloroplasts were resuspended in 90 ml of breaking buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm α-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 10 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.8), and 15 ml were layered on top of a 22-ml two-layered sucrose gradient (0.6 m sucrose and 0.93 m sucrose in 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm α-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 10 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.8). After centrifugation at 53,000 × g for 1 h, chloroplast envelope membranes were isolated from the 0.6/0.93 m sucrose interface. To remove sucrose, the envelope membranes were centrifuged in dilution buffer (1 mm PMSF, 5 mm α-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 10 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.8) at 83,000 × g for 1 h. The envelope pellet was resuspended in a minimum volume of dilution buffer and used immediately for immunoprecipitation or actin co-sedimentation assays without any freezing step. Antibodies raised against chloroplast envelope proteins or actin were used to examine the agglutination of isolated intact chloroplasts. For agglutination assays, 10 μl of chloroplast suspension containing 18 μg of chlorophyll were incubated for 10 min on a glass slide with 5 μl of washing buffer and 5 μl of antibodies. The slides were examined at room temperature by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a TCS-SP2 operating system (Leica) using an immersion 40× objective. Chloroplasts were visualized by transmission and chlorophyll fluorescence. Chlorophyll was excited using the 543-nm line of a He-Ne laser, and fluorescence was collected between 630 and 750 nm. The plasmids encoding AtToc159, AtToc33G, and AtToc159G fused to GST were introduced into E. coli BL21. The strains were cultured overnight in 5 ml of L-broth medium containing carbenicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C and transferred into 100 ml of L-broth medium containing carbenicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C. After incubation for 4 h, expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1 mm final concentration. After induction for 4 h at 37 °C, the cells were recovered by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 2 ml of Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 155 mm NaCl). The cells were broken by sonication (6 × 10-s pulses at 24 kHz) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatants were used for actin co-sedimentation assays. Proteins were solubilized in SDS-loading buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (23.Broglie R.M. Hunter C.N. Delepelaire P. Niederman R.A. Chua N.H. Clayton R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980; 77: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were fixed in isopropanol/acetic acid (3:1, v/v) for 30 min before staining with colloidal Coomassie Blue (24.Neuhoff V. Stamm R. Eibl H. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 427-448Crossref Scopus (542) Google Scholar) or silver (25.Switzer 3rd, R.C. Merril C.R. Shifrin S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Proteins were stained overnight in colloidal blue (1.3 m ammonium sulfate, 34% methanol, 0.5% acetic acid, 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250; Sigma-Aldrich) and destained in distilled water until the desired contrast was achieved. For silver staining, the gel was washed twice for 10 min in distilled water followed by a 1-min incubation in 1.8 mm sodium hydrosulfite, two 1-min washes in distilled water, 30–60 min of incubation in 12 mm silver nitrate, a 10-s wash in distilled water, incubation in 0.19 m sodium carbonate, 40 mm sodium thiosulfate, and 0.25% (v/v) formaldehyde until the desired contrast was achieved, and fixing for 30 min in 0.33 m Tris-HCl, 2% (v/v) acetic acid. For Western blotting, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) (26.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). The proteins were visualized with rabbit or mouse primary antibody against a specific protein and anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Protein quantification was done by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Pea chloroplast envelope membranes (5 μg of proteins per μl) were solubilized in 0.5% (w/v) n-dodecylmaltoside by mixing for 30 min on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by Bradford protein assay. An aliquot with 1 mg of protein was incubated overnight with 40 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) conjugated with monoclonal actin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 500 μl of Tris-buffered saline, 0.5% n-dodecylmaltoside at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Beads were pelleted by a 30-s centrifugation at 3000 × g and washed 5 times with 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20. Proteins remaining on the beads were solubilized in 20 μl of SDS-loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE for colloidal blue staining and mass spectrometry analysis, silver staining, or Western blot analysis. The protein samples (lysed bacterial suspension or 1% (w/v) Lubrol (Sigma-Aldrich)-solubilized pea chloroplast envelope membranes) were precleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was used for the actin co-sedimentation assay. The proteins (30 or 50 μg) were mixed with various amounts (0–1.6 μg) of human non-muscle actin (Cytoskeleton Inc.) in a total volume of 100 μl of Tris-buffered saline. The samples were incubated on a rotating wheel for 1 h at room temperature and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The pellets were suspended in 40 μl of SDS-loading buffer, vortexed, and heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and 15-μl samples were loaded on two SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels for silver staining and Western blot analysis. After SDS-PAGE and colloidal blue staining of chloroplast envelope proteins co-immunoprecipitated with actin, the gel was cut into 17 bands between the top of the gel and the immunoglobulin heavy chain and 15 bands between the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. Proteins present in the two bands containing the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains and proteins with a higher mobility than the light chain, i.e. with molecular mass <26 kDa, were not analyzed. Each gel slice was processed individually to allow comparison of the identified proteins with their electrophoretic mobilities. All analyses were carried out at the Cambridge Centre for Proteomics (Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge). Proteins within the gel slices were reduced, carboxyamidomethylated, and then digested with trypsin on a MassPrepStation (Waters, Manchester, UK). The resulting peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Reverse-phase liquid chromatographic separation of peptides was achieved with a PepMap C18 reverse phase, 75-μm inner diameter, 15-cm column (LC Packings, Amsterdam) on a capillary liquid chromatography system (Waters) attached to a Dionex Dual Gradient liquid chromatography system attached to a QSTAR XL mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation data were used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Viridiplantae protein data base and a pea cDNA data base containing 70,007 contigs generated by massively parallel pyrosequencing (27.Bräutigam A. Shrestha R.P. Whitten D. Wilkerson C. G Carr K.M. Froehlich J.E. Weber A.P.M. J. Biotechnol. 2008; 136: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using the MASCOT search engine. Probability-based MASCOT scores were used to evaluate identifications. Only matches with p < 0.05 for random occurrence were considered significant. Preliminary experiments were carried out to examine whether actin was present at the surface of isolated intact chloroplasts by agglutination with antibodies to actin. Chloroplasts were isolated under low salt conditions to decrease contamination by cytosolic actin filaments and carefully washed to remove unbound actin monomers. The chloroplast suspension was incubated on a glass slide with antibodies to actin, to the chloroplast outer envelope protein OEP21 (28.Bölter B. Soll J. Hill K. Hemmler R. Wagner R. Embo J. 1999; 18: 5505-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), or to the chloroplast inner envelope protein IEP37 (29.Teyssier E. Block M.A. Douce R. Joyard J. Plant J. 1996; 10: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and examined by bright field and fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1A). In the absence of antibodies, the chloroplasts were uniformly distributed on the slide, and incubation with antibodies to IEP37 had little effect on the distribution of the chloroplasts, confirming that the chloroplasts were intact. However, incubations with antibodies to OEP21 and to actin resulted in marked aggregation and clumping of the chloroplasts, suggesting that these proteins were accessible at the chloroplast surface. Western blot analysis was then carried out to determine whether actin was detectable in purified pea chloroplast envelope membranes. Samples of pea leaf extract, isolated intact chloroplasts, and purified chloroplast envelope membranes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). The protein profile of the envelope membrane was similar to those previously published, with three bands at 97, 86, and 75 kDa, a predominant band at 29 kDa corresponding to the phosphate translocator, and some contamination with the large subunit of the Rubisco (30.Werner-Washburne M. Cline K. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1983; 73: 569-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis with antibodies against IEP37 and OEP21 demonstrated a strong enrichment of these chloroplast inner and outer membrane proteins in the envelope fraction (Fig. 1C). The presence of actin in the pea leaf fractions was examined with a monoclonal antibody against chicken actin. A strong reaction to a 42-kDa protein was obtained with the pea leaf extract, indicating that the monoclonal antibody recognized pea actin. This protein was barely detectable in the intact chloroplast fraction, although it was present at a detectable level in the chloroplast envelope fraction. This represents a clear enrichment of actin in the envelope fraction by comparison with the chloroplast fraction, confirming an association of actin with the envelope membrane. In an attempt to identify envelope membrane proteins interacting with actin, antibodies to actin were incubated with detergent-solubilized envelope membranes, and the co-immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Pea chloroplast envelope membranes were solubilized with 0.5% (w/v) dodecylmaltoside, a mild non-ionic detergent, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The solubilized envelope membrane proteins were incubated with protein G-agarose beads in the presence or absence of antibodies to chicken actin, and proteins bound to the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE. Silver staining was used to visualize the immunoprecipitated polypeptides, because colloidal blue staining was not sufficiently sensitive to detect polypeptides other than the immunoglobulin chains. A lane containing proteins eluted from protein G-agarose beads incubated in the presence of anti-actin antibodies but in the absence of envelope proteins was used to detect proteins from the antibody preparation. Major bands of 50 and 25 kDa, corresponding to immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, were present in the lanes from incubations with actin antibodies (Fig. 2A). Several discrete envelope membrane proteins, particularly those of 110, 86, 75, and 33–34 kDa, were specifically immunoprecipitated by the anti-actin antibodies and were not present in the lane of envelope proteins bound to protein G-agarose beads in the absence of anti-actin antibodies. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of this gel with anti-actin antibodies detected a strong band at 42 kDa in the lane containing immunoprecipitated envelope membrane proteins (marked by a red arrow in Fig. 2B). The immunoglobulin heavy and light chains and a contaminating band at 41 kDa, seen as stained bands in Fig. 2A, were also detected by the secondary anti-mouse IgG antibodies in lanes from incubations containing anti-actin antibodies. The band at 41 kDa, which has a slightly faster electrophoretic mobility than the 42-kDa actin protein, is dependent on the presence of the anti-actin antibodies and not on the presence of the envelope proteins. This suggests it is a contaminant from the anti-actin antibodies retained on the agarose beads. Because this band is detected by the anti-actin antibodies (Fig. 2B), it is probably an actin contaminant present within the antibody preparation. This experiment provides further evidence for the presence of actin in the chloroplast envelope preparation and indicates that specific envelope proteins were co-immunoprecipitated by anti-actin antibodies. In an attempt to identify envelope proteins co-immunoprecipitated with actin, the experiment described above was repeated, and the SDS-polyacrylamide gel was stained with colloidal blue to allow mass spectrometric analysis of immunoprecipitated proteins. The gel was cut into 17 slices above the immunoglobulin heavy chain and into 15 slices between the heavy and light chains, and the proteins were digested in the gel with trypsin. Each gel slice was processed individually to allow comparison of the identified proteins with their electrophoretic mobilities. Proteins migrating with the same mobility as the two immunoglobulin chains or migrating more rapidly than the light chain, i.e. with a molecular mass <26 kDa, were not analyzed. The tryptic peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and the mass data were compared with the NCBI Viridiplantae protein data base using MASCOT software. Only proteins with a MASCOT score above 100 with more than 2 distinct peptides identified and with a molecular mass corresponding to the migration position on the SDS-PAGE gel are shown in Table 1. All the proteins identified showed matches with previously known pea sequences. None of the unidentified peptides matched with plant proteins from other species in the NCBI Viridiplantae data base. The importance of species-specific comparisons for stringent identification of proteins from peptide mass data has recently been emphasized (27.Bräutigam A. Shrestha R.P. Whitten D. Wilkerson C. G Carr K.M. Froehlich J.E. Weber A.P.M. J. Biotechnol. 2008; 136: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), so the mass data were compared with a six-frame translation of a pea cDNA data base generated by massively parallel pyrosequencing (27.Bräutigam A. Shrestha R.P. Whitten D. Wilkerson C. G Carr K.M. Froehlich J.E. Weber A.P.M. J. Biotechnol. 2008; 136: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This confirmed the identification of all the proteins in Table 1 but failed to identify any additional proteins.TABLE 1Identification of chloroplast envelope proteins co-immunoprecipitated with actinIdentified pea proteinMassBandPeptidesScorekDaActin421910585TOC75751113801Malate dehydrogenase382/2211617Glycolate oxidase402/209520ClpC = hsp9393912506TOC34342410483TIC11011047403TIC40401811481VIPP13025/267/5418/286ATP synthase α chain531/166333Ferredoxin NADP+ reductase35245329TOC159159 or 862/107/5305/265Rubisco activase462/197297Cytochrome f351/246250EF-Tu482/183239TIC3232264232Phosphate translocator291/294207PSII D2382/214204Lipoxygenase9796200GAPDH442/194151Ferredoxin sulfite reductase701/134128TIC5555163114 Open table in a new tab The presence of actin was confirmed by the mass identification of 10 different peptides and a high MASCOT score of 585. Many of the other proteins identified as co-immunoprecipitating with actin are components of the TOC-TIC complex. Three components of the TOC complex (Toc159, Toc75, and Toc34) and five components of the TIC complex (Tic110, Tic55, Tic40, Tic32, and ClpC) were identified. Ferredoxin NADP+ reductase, which has been reported to associate with the TIC complex (31.Balsera M. Stengel A. Soll J. Bölter B. BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), was also detected, but Tic62, with which ferredoxin NADP+ reductase is reported to interact (31.Balsera M. Stengel A. Soll J. Bölter B. BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), was not identified in the immunoprecipitated material. Many of the proteins identified as migrating in the gel at the expected size were also detected in material running at the top of the gel (bands 1 and 2). These proteins may represent aggregated material precipitated on the agarose beads rather than proteins specifically immunoprecipitated with actin. They include cytochrome f, the D2 subunit of photosystem II, the α subunit of ATP synthase, malate dehydrogenase, glycolate oxidase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ferredoxin-sulfite reductase, and the phosphate translocator. All of the other proteins, including the components of the TOC-TIC complex, were found at the expected size and were not detected in the top bands of the gel.

https://openalex.org/W2165790078,"The Cul4A gene, which encodes a core component of a cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, is overexpressed in breast and hepatocellular cancers. In breast cancers, overexpression of Cul4A strongly correlates with poor prognosis. In addition, Cul4A is required for early embryonic development. The early lethality of mouse embryos prevented a detailed analysis of the functions of Cul4A. Here, we used a strain of mice carrying floxed alleles of Cul4A to study its role in cell division, in vitro and in vivo. Embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) show a severe deficiency in cell proliferation after deletion of Cul4A. We observed that the Cul4A protein is abundantly expressed in the brain, liver and the mammary tissue of pregnant mice. Deletion of Cul4A in the liver impairs hepatocyte proliferation during regeneration after carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced injury. The Cul4A-deleted cells are slow in entering the S phase, and are deficient in progressing through the early M phase. Several cell-cycle regulators, including p53 and p27Kip1, are deregulated in the Cul4A-deleted cells. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of p53 causes significant reversal of the proliferation defects in Cul4A-deleted cells. The Cul4A-deleted cells show an aberrant number of centrosome, multipolar spindles and micronuclei formation. Furthermore, those cells are sensitive to UV irradiation and show reduced levels of unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS). Together, our observations indicate that Cul4A is required for efficient cell proliferation, control of centrosome amplification and genome stability."
https://openalex.org/W2021455495,"In this study, we investigated the metabolic phenotype of the NF-kappaB p50 knock-out (p50-KO) mice. Compared with wild type mice, the p50-KO mice had an increase in food intake, but a decrease in body fat content. On chow diet, their blood glucose dropped much more than the wild type (WT) mice in the insulin tolerance test. Their glucose infusion rate was 30% higher than that of the WT mice in the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Their hepatic glucose production was suppressed more actively by insulin, and their insulin-induced glucose uptake was not altered in skeletal muscle or adipose tissue. In the liver, their p70S6K (S6K1) protein was significantly lower, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression was much higher. Their S6K1 protein was reduced by TNF-alpha treatment in the primary culture of hepatocytes. S6K1 reduction was blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. In their livers, IKK2 (IKKbeta) activity was reduced together with IKKgamma. Their S6K1 degradation was dependent on IKK2 deficiency. Reconstitution of the S6K1 protein in their liver blocked the increase in insulin sensitivity. S6K1 degradation was not observed in hepatocytes of the WT mice. The data suggest that inactivation of NF-kappaB p50 leads to suppression of IKK2 activity in the liver. IKK2 deficiency leads to S6K1 inhibition through TNF-induced protein degradation. The S6K1 reduction may contribute to insulin sensitivity in p50-KO mice. This study suggests that hepatic S6K1 may be a drug target in the treatment of insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2075149831,"Lipoic acid (LA) is a dithiol-containing cofactor that is essential for the function of alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes. LA acts as a reversible acyl group acceptor and 'swinging arm' during acyl-coenzyme A formation. The cofactor is post-translationally attached to the acyl-transferase subunits of the multienzyme complexes through the action of octanoyl (lipoyl): N-octanoyl (lipoyl) transferase (LipB) or lipoic acid protein ligases (LplA). Remarkably, apicomplexan parasites possess LA biosynthesis as well as scavenging pathways and the two pathways are distributed between mitochondrion and a vestigial organelle, the apicoplast. The apicoplast-specific LipB is dispensable for parasite growth due to functional redundancy of the parasite's lipoic acid/octanoic acid ligases/transferases. In this study, we show that LplA1 plays a pivotal role during the development of the erythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite. Gene disruptions in the human malaria parasite P. falciparum consistently were unsuccessful while in the rodent malaria model parasite P. berghei the LplA1 gene locus was targeted by knock-in and knockout constructs. However, the LplA1((-)) mutant could not be cloned suggesting a critical role of LplA1 for asexual parasite growth in vitro and in vivo. These experimental genetics data suggest that lipoylation during expansion in red blood cells largely occurs through salvage from the host erythrocytes and subsequent ligation of LA to the target proteins of the malaria parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2002661196,"Recently, we reported the identification of a novel gene named RBEL1 (Rab-like protein 1) and characterized its two encoded isoforms, RBEL1A and RBEL1B, that function as novel GTPases of Ras superfamily. Here we report the identification of two additional splice variants of RBEL1 that we have named RBEL1C and -D. All four RBEL1 isoforms (A, B, C, and D) have identical N termini harboring the Rab-like GTPase domains but contain variable C termini. Although all isoforms can be detected in both cytoplasm and nucleus, RBEL1A is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas RBEL1B is mostly nuclear. RBEL1C and -D, by contrast, are evenly distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, all four RBEL1 proteins are also capable of associating with cellular membrane. The RBEL1 proteins also exhibit a unique nucleotide-binding potential and, whereas the larger A and B isoforms are mainly GTP-bound, the smaller C and D variants bind to both GTP and GDP. Furthermore, a regulatory region at amino acid position 236-302 immediately adjacent to the GTP-binding domain is important for GTP-binding potential of RBEL1A, because deletion of this region converts RBEL1A from predominantly GTP-bound to GDP-bound. RBEL1 knockdown via RNA interference results in marked cell growth suppression, which is associated with morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis as well as inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. Taken together, our results indicate that RBEL1 proteins are linked to cell growth and survival and possess unique biochemical, cellular, and functional characteristics and, therefore, appear to form a novel subfamily of GTPases within the Ras superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W2091258426,"Keeping pandemic influenza at bay is a global health priority. Of particular concern is the continued spread of the influenza subtype H5N1 in avian populations and the increasing frequency of transmission to humans. To decrease this threat, mass culling is the principal strategy for eradicating influenza in avian populations. Although culling has a crucial short-term epidemiological benefit, evolutionary repercussions on reservoir hosts and on the viral population have not been considered.To explore the epidemiological and evolutionary repercussions of mass avian culling, we combine population genetics and epidemiological influenza dynamics in a mathematical model parameterized by clinical, epidemiological, and poultry data. We model the virulence level of influenza and the selection on a dominant allele that confers resistance against influenza [1, 2] in a poultry population. Our findings indicate that culling impedes the evolution of avian host resistance against influenza. On the pathogen side of the coevolutionary race between pathogen and host, culling selects for heightened virulence and transmissibility of influenza.Mass culling achieves a short-term benefit at the expense of long-term detriments: a more genetically susceptible host population, ultimately greater mortality, and elevated influenza virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2031821917,"Magnesium deficiency is suggested to contribute to many age-related diseases. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) is known to be a master regulator of hypoxic response. Here we show that hypomagnesemia suppresses reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced HIF-1α activity in paraganglion cells of the adrenal medulla and carotid body. In PC12 cells cultured in the low magnesium medium and treated with cobalt chloride (CoCl<sub>2</sub>) or exposed to intermittent hypoxia, ROS-mediated HIF-1α activity was suppressed. This suppression was due to up-regulation of inhibitory PAS (Per/Arnt/Sim) domain protein (IPAS) that was caused by NF-κB activation, which resulted from ROS and calcium influx mainly through the T-type calcium channels. Induction of tyrosine hydroxylase, a target of HIF-1, by CoCl<sub>2</sub> injection was suppressed in the adrenal medulla of magnesium-deficient mice because of up-regulation of IPAS. Also in the carotid body of magnesium-deficient mice, CoCl<sub>2</sub> and chronic intermittent hypoxia failed to enhance the tyrosine hydroxylase expression. These results demonstrate that serum magnesium levels are a key determinant for ROS-induced hypoxic responses."
https://openalex.org/W2020314417,"Interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family members have been implicated as critical transcription factors that function in immune response, hematopoietic differentiation and cell growth regulation. Activation of IRF-5 results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFalpha, IL6 and IL12p40, as well as type I interferons.In this study, we identify a G202C (position relative to translation start codon) missense-mutation transcript of IRF-5 in transformed B and T cell lines, which were either infected or non-infected by viruses, and peripheral blood from ATL or CLL patients. The mutated transcript encodes a novel protein in which the sixty-eighth amino acid, Alanine, is substituted by Proline (IRF-5P68) in the DNA binding domain of IRF-5. IRF-5P68 phenotype results in a complete loss of its DNA-binding activity and functions as a dominant negative molecule through interacting with wild type IRF-5. Co-expression of IRF-5P68 inhibits MyD88-mediated IRF-5 transactivation. Moreover, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent IL6 and IL12P40 production induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), R837 or CpG ODN 1826 was reduced in IRF-5 (P68) expressing cells as compared to the control cells.IRF-5P68 acts as a dominant negative regulator that interferes with IRF-5-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The functional characterization of the novel IRF-5 mutant in transformed B and T cell lines and in ATL and CLL patients may lead to a better understanding of the role of these transcriptional regulators in hematopoietic malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2052761326,"The neuropeptide somatostatin has been suggested to play an important role during neuronal development in addition to its established modulatory impact on neuroendocrine, motor and cognitive functions in adults. Although six somatostatin G protein-coupled receptors have been discovered, little is known about their distribution and function in the developing mammalian brain. In this study, we have first characterized the developmental expression of the somatostatin receptor sst2A, the subtype found most prominently in the adult rat and human nervous system. In the rat, the sst2A receptor expression appears as early as E12 and is restricted to post-mitotic neuronal populations leaving the ventricular zone. From E12 on, migrating neuronal populations immunopositive for the receptor were observed in numerous developing regions including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and ganglionic eminences. Intense but transient immunoreactive signals were detected in the deep part of the external granular layer of the cerebellum, the rostral migratory stream and in tyrosine hydroxylase- and serotonin- positive neurons and axons. Activation of the sst2A receptor in vitro in rat cerebellar microexplants and primary hippocampal neurons revealed stimulatory effects on neuronal migration and axonal growth, respectively. In the human cortex, receptor immunoreactivity was located in the preplate at early development stages (8 gestational weeks) and was enriched to the outer part of the germinal zone at later stages. In the cerebellum, the deep part of the external granular layer was strongly immunoreactive at 19 gestational weeks, similar to the finding in rodents. In addition, migrating granule cells in the internal granular layer were also receptor-positive. Together, theses results strongly suggest that the somatostatin sst2A receptor participates in the development and maturation of specific neuronal populations during rat and human brain ontogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2072657266,"The amount of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a pivotal enzyme for the biosynthesis of the guanosine tri-phosphate (GTP), is frequently increased in tumor cells. The anti-viral agent ribavirin and the immunosuppressant mycophenolic acid (MPA) are potent inhibitors of IMPDH. We recently showed that IMPDH inhibition led to a necrotic signal requiring the activation of Cdc42.Herein, we strengthened the essential role played by this small GTPase in the necrotic signal by silencing Cdc42 and by the ectopic expression of a constitutive active mutant of Cdc42. Since resistance to apoptosis is an essential step for the tumorigenesis process, we next examined the effect of the MPA-mediated necrotic signal on different tumor cells demonstrating various mechanisms of resistance to apoptosis (Bcl2-, HSP70-, Lyn-, BCR-ABL-overexpressing cells). All tested cells remained sensitive to MPA-mediated necrotic signal. Furthermore, inhibition of IMPDH activity in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia cells was significantly more efficient at eliminating malignant cells than apoptotic inducers.These findings indicate that necrosis and apoptosis are split signals that share few if any common hub of signaling. In addition, the necrotic signaling pathway induced by depletion of the cellular amount of GTP/GDP would be of great interest to eliminate apoptotic-resistant tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2162809655,"Targeted deletion of IA-2 and IA-2beta, major autoantigens in type 1 diabetes and transmembrane secretory vesicle proteins, results in impaired secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of these deletions on daily rhythms in blood pressure, heart rate, core body temperature, and spontaneous physical and neuronal activity. We found that deletion of both IA-2 and IA-2beta profoundly disrupts the usual diurnal variation of each of these parameters, whereas the deletion of either IA-2 or IA-2beta alone did not produce a major change. In situ hybridization revealed that IA-2 and IA-2beta transcripts are highly but nonrhythmically expressed in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the site of the brain's master circadian oscillator. Electrophysiological studies on tissue slices from the suprachiasmatic nuclei showed that disruption of both IA-2 and IA-2beta results in significant alterations in neuronal firing. From these studies, we concluded that deletion of IA-2 and IA-2beta, structural proteins of secretory vesicles and modulators of neuroendocrine secretion, has a profound effect on the circadian system."
https://openalex.org/W2022887707,"The redox sensor protein HSCARG translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to decreased cellular NADPH or increased nitric oxide, and is involved in protein regulation. However, the regulatory mechanism of HSCARG has remained elusive. In this report, through a yeast two-hybrid screen, HSCARG was found to associate with the copper metabolism gene MURR1 domain containing protein 1 (COMMD1), an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, and negatively regulate COMMD1 by accelerating its ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. Interestingly, we observed that HSCARG also blocked basal and stimulus-coupled NF-kappaB activation by promoting ubiquitination and degradation of the NF-kappaB subunit RelA. Further analyses showed that in cells under normal conditions, HSCARG localized mainly in the cytoplasm and acted as a negative regulator of COMMD1, and was distributed in the nucleus in small quantities to inhibit NF-kappaB. Although in response to intracellular redox changes by dehydroepiandrosterone or S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine treatment, a large amount of HSCARG translocated to the nucleus, which terminated NF-kappaB activation. Meanwhile, COMMD1 was restored due to decreased cytoplasmic HSCARG levels and negatively regulated NF-kappaB as well. Thus, NF-kappaB activation was terminated efficiently. Our results indicate that HSCARG plays critical roles in regulation of NF-kappaB in response to cellular redox changes by promoting ubiquitination and proteolysis of RelA or COMMD1."
https://openalex.org/W2092084255,"The gaseous signalling molecule nitric oxide (NO) is involved in various physiological processes including regulation of blood pressure, immunocytotoxicity and neurotransmission. In the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB), NO plays a role in the formation of olfactory memory evoked by pheromones as well as conventional odorants. While NO generated by the neuronal isoform of NO synthase (nNOS) regulates neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium, NO has not been implicated in olfactory signal transduction. We now show the expression and function of the endothelial isoform of NO synthase (eNOS) in mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of adult mice. Using NO-sensitive micro electrodes, we show that stimulation liberates NO from isolated wild-type OSNs, but not from OSNs of eNOS deficient mice. Integrated electrophysiological recordings (electro-olfactograms or EOGs) from the olfactory epithelium of these mice show that NO plays a significant role in modulating adaptation. Evidence for the presence of eNOS in mature mammalian OSNs and its involvement in odorant adaptation implicates NO as an important new element involved in olfactory signal transduction. As a diffusible messenger, NO could also have additional functions related to cross adaptation, regeneration, and maintenance of MOE homeostasis."

In the absence of universal definition, immune function in such HIV controllers remains an indication of non-progression. Methodology/Principal Findings CD4 T-cell responses to a number of HIV-1 proteins and peptide pools were assessed by IFN-γ ELISpot and lymphoproliferative assays in HIV controllers and chronic progressors. Thymic output was assessed by sjTRECs levels. Follow-up of 41 HIV-1+ individuals originally identified as “Long-term non-progressors” in 1996 according to clinical criteria, and longitudinal analysis of two HIV controllers over 22 years, was also performed. HIV controllers exhibited substantial IFN-γ producing and proliferative HIV-1-specific CD4 T-cell responses to both recombinant proteins and peptide pools of Tat, Rev, Nef, Gag and Env, demonstrating functional processing and presentation. Conversely, HIV-specific T-cell responses were limited to IFN-γ production in chronic progressors. Additionally, thymic output was approximately 19 fold higher in HIV controllers than in age-matched chronic progressors. Follow-up of 41 HIV-1+ patients identified as LTNP in 1996 revealed the transitory characteristics of this status. IFN-γ production and proliferative T-cell function also declines in 2 HIV controllers over 22 years. Conclusions Although increased thymic output and anti-HIV-1 T-cell responses are observed in HIV controllers compared to chronic progressors, the nature of nonprogressor/controller status appears to be transitory."
https://openalex.org/W2054774877,"Fragile X syndrome is caused by a lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) due to silencing of the FMR1 gene. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the central nervous system contribute to higher brain functions including learning/memory, persistent pain, and mental disorders. Our recent study has shown that activation of Group I mGluR up-regulated FMRP in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a key region for brain cognitive and executive functions; Ca2+ signaling pathways could be involved in the regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs. In this study we demonstrate that stimulating Group I mGluRs activates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) in ACC neurons. In ACC neurons of adult mice overexpressing CaMKIV, the up-regulation of FMRP by stimulating Group I mGluR is enhanced. The enhancement occurs at the transcriptional level as the Fmr1 mRNA level was further elevated compared with wild-type mice. Using pharmacological approaches, we found that inhibition of CaMKIV could attenuate the up-regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs. CaMKIV contribute to the regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs probably through cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) activation, as manipulation of CaMKIV could simultaneously cause the change of CREB phosphorylation induced by Group I mGluR activation. Our study has provided strong evidence for CaMKIV as a molecular link between Group I mGluRs and FMRP in ACC neurons and may help us to elucidate the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome.

Fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited form of human mental retardation, is caused by mutations of the FMR1 gene that encodes the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) 4The abbreviations used are: FMRPfragile X mental retardation proteinmGluRmetabotropic glutamate receptorCaMKIVCa2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IVKOknock outACCanterior cingulate cortexDHPG(R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycineACDPP3-amino-6-chloro-5-dimethylamino-N-2-pyridinylpyrazine carboxamide hydrochlorideCPAcyclopiazonic acidL-VDCCsL-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channelCREBcyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding proteinpCREBphosphorylated CREBBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolRTreverse transcriptionWTwild type.4The abbreviations used are: FMRPfragile X mental retardation proteinmGluRmetabotropic glutamate receptorCaMKIVCa2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IVKOknock outACCanterior cingulate cortexDHPG(R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycineACDPP3-amino-6-chloro-5-dimethylamino-N-2-pyridinylpyrazine carboxamide hydrochlorideCPAcyclopiazonic acidL-VDCCsL-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channelCREBcyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding proteinpCREBphosphorylated CREBBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolRTreverse transcriptionWTwild type.

These findings suggest that the dysfunction of ACC due to lack of FMRP may be responsible for certain types of mental disorders in fragile X syndrome.

Stimulating Group I mGluRs with DHPG, an agonist of Group I mGluRs, activates CaMKIV in cingulate cortex. Using transgenic mice overexpressing CaMKIV (35.Fukushima H. Maeda R. Suzuki R. Suzuki A. Nomoto M. Toyoda H. Wu L.J. Xu H. Zhao M.G. Ueda K. Kitamoto A. Mamiya N. Yoshida T. Homma S. Masushige S. Zhuo M. Kida S. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 9910-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we found that CaMKIV contributes to the up-regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs. By measuring Fmr1 mRNA, we found that overexpression of CaMKIV enhanced the transcription of Fmr1 gene. In addition, we provided evidence that CaMKIV is involved in regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs through activation of cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB). These findings were further confirmed by pharmacological inhibition of CaMKIV. We propose that CaMKIV is a key molecule in regulation of FMRP Group I mGluRs through the Ca2+-stimulated CREB signaling pathway. CaMKIV may play an isoform-specific role in regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs in ACC neurons, as the CaMK inhibitor did not show effect in CaMKIV KO mice.DISCUSSIONOur previous studies suggest that FMRP is required for the physiological function of ACC (21.Wang H. Wu L.J. Kim S.S. Lee F.J. Gong B. Toyoda H. Ren M. Shang Y.Z. Xu H. Liu F. Zhao M.G. Zhuo M. Neuron. 2008; 59: 634-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 25.Zhao M.G.

Recently, we provided the direct biochemical evidence that activation of Group I mGluRs up-regulates FMRP in the ACC neurons of adult mice. The up-regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs occurs at the transcriptional level. Activation of Group I mGluRs induced the phosphorylation of CREB in ACC neurons (31.Wang H. Wu L.J. Zhang F. Zhuo M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4385-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study we provided novel evidence that stimulating Group I mGluRs activates CaMKIV in ACC neurons. CaMKIV contributes to the up-regulation of FMRP and the phosphorylation of CREB induced by stimulating Group I mGluRs. Our results indicate that CaMKIV acts as a key intracellular messenger for signaling pathways between Group I mGluRs and FMRP in cingulate cortex.Group I mGluRs, Ca2+, and CaMKIV ActivationThe Ca2+ signaling pathways are believed to play a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity (45.Colomer J.

CaMKIV, a key Ca2+ signaling molecule in Ca2+ signaling pathways, can be activated by the increase of intracellular Ca2+ (32.Ho N. Liauw J.A. Blaeser F. Wei F. Hanissian S. Muglia L.M. Wozniak D.F.

These data provide novel evidence that CaMKIV can be activated by stimulating Group I mGluRs.Ca2+ is released from trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular stores upon Group I mGluR activation (41.Heinke B. Sandkühler J. Neuropharmacology. 2007; 52: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 53.Rae M.G. Martin D.J. Collingridge G.L. Irving A.J. J.

We found that application of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+/ATPase pump inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid before and during Group I mGluR activation partially blocked the phosphorylation of CaMKIV due to Group I mGluR activation. Another possible source for intracellular Ca2+ is Ca2+ influx through L-VDCCs. Previous studies have shown that membrane depolarization by DHPG treatment can trigger the opening of L-VDCCs (38.Bianchi R. Young S.R. Wong R.K. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 81: 2903-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 40.Mao L. Wang J.Q. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 42.Heinke B. Sandkühler J. Pain. 2005; 118: 145-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we found that application of l-VDCC blocker nifedipine also partially blocked the phosphorylation of CaMKIV caused by Group I mGluR activation. When the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+/ATPase pump inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid was co-applied with nifedipine to ACC slices, the phosphorylation of CaMKIV was almost completely blocked. It indicates that both Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and Ca2+ influx from L-VDCCs are required for the activation of CaMKIV by Group I mGluRs in ACC neurons.CaMKIV and the Regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRsIt is well known that CaMKIV transduces Ca2+ signaling and functions as a transcriptional activator in synaptic plasticity (33.Wei F. Qiu C.S. Liauw J. Robinson D.A. Ho N. Chatila T. Zhuo M. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 34.Wayman G.A. Lee Y.S. Tokumitsu H. Silva A. Soderling T.R.

It is likely that CaMKIV might be involved in the signaling pathway downstream of Group I mGluRs. By using mice overexpressing CaMKIV, we confirmed that CaMKIV acts downstream of Group I mGluRs and contributes to the regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs in ACC neurons.In addition, genetic deletion of CaMKIV or inhibiting CaMKs could partially block the increase of FMRP induced by stimulating Group I mGluRs in ACC slices. This result further support the conclusion that CaMKIV is required for the up-regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs in ACC neurons. Pharmacological inhibition of CaMKs did not affect regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs in ACC slices from CaMKIV KO mice. It suggests that CaMKIV may play an isoform-specific role in regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs in cingulate cortex.In this study we also found that raising intracellular calcium by application of calcium ionophore A23187 did not affect the expression of FMRP, although it could activate CaMKIV and enhance the phosphorylation of CaMKIV and the up-regulation of FMRP by stimulating Group I mGluRs in ACC slices. These results suggest that intracellular calcium and CaMKIV, which can be shared by many different signaling pathways, may specifically contribute to the regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs.CaMKIV and CREB Activation by Group I mGluRsThe CREB is a transcriptional factor that plays an important role in synaptic plasticity (62.Bito H.

Previous studies have shown that there is the CRE site in FMR1 promoter and implicated CREB in the regulation of the FMR1 gene transcription in neural cells (65.Hwu W.L. Wang T.R. Lee Y.M.

Our recent study found that the Group I mGluR-dependent regulation of FMRP in ACC neurons occurs at the transcriptional level, as new Fmr1 mRNA is transcribed, as shown by RT-PCR; the up-regulation of FMRP is accompanied by the phosphorylation of CREB (Ser-133) (31.Wang H. Wu L.J. Zhang F. Zhuo M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4385-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These results supported that CREB acts as a transcriptional factor for Group I mGluR-dependent regulation of FMRP in the neurons.There are several signaling pathways that lead to the activation of CREB. Ca2+ and CaMKIV is implicated in various aspects of the neuronal Ca2+ signaling pathways, inducing the phosphorylation of CREB and the gene expression in response to excitatory neurotransmission (32.Ho N.

The phosphorylation of CREB induced by the Group I mGluR agonist DHPG was partially blocked in ACC slices from CaMKIV KO mice, suggesting CaMKIV could be involved in the activation of CREB induced by stimulating Group I mGluRs (31.Wang H. Wu L.J. Zhang F. Zhuo M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4385-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study we have shown that the phosphorylation of CREB induced by DHPG was enhanced in ACC slices from mice overexpressing CaMKIV. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of CaMKIV also partially blocked phosphorylation of CREB induced by DHPG. These novel findings further confirm that CaMKIV is critical for phosphorylation of CREB induced by stimulating Group I mGluRs, and CaMKIV contributes to regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs probably through CREB activation.In summary, we have demonstrated that the CaMKIV is critical for regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs in ACC neurons by using genetic and pharmacological approaches. CaMKIV is activated by stimulating Group I mGluRs and contributes to the up-regulation of FMRP probably through the activation of CREB. Our study has provided strong evidence for CaMKIV as the key signaling molecule for regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs in cingulate cortex and may help to further elucidate the cellular mechanisms underlying fragile X syndrome. Fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited form of human mental retardation, is caused by mutations of the FMR1 gene that encodes the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) 4The abbreviations used are: FMRPfragile X mental retardation proteinmGluRmetabotropic glutamate receptorCaMKIVCa2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IVKOknock outACCanterior cingulate cortexDHPG(R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycineACDPP3-amino-6-chloro-5-dimethylamino-N-2-pyridinylpyrazine carboxamide hydrochlorideCPAcyclopiazonic acidL-VDCCsL-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channelCREBcyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding proteinpCREBphosphorylated CREBBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolRTreverse transcriptionWTwild type.4The abbreviations used are: FMRPfragile X mental retardation proteinmGluRmetabotropic glutamate receptorCaMKIVCa2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IVKOknock outACCanterior cingulate cortexDHPG(R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycineACDPP3-amino-6-chloro-5-dimethylamino-N-2-pyridinylpyrazine carboxamide hydrochlorideCPAcyclopiazonic acidL-VDCCsL-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channelCREBcyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding proteinpCREBphosphorylated CREBBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolRTre"
https://openalex.org/W2056130506,"Cell lineage studies in mollusk embryos have documented numerous variations on the lophotrochozoan theme of spiral cleavage. In the experimentally tractable embryo of the mud snail Ilyanassa, cell lineage has previously been described only up to the 29-cell stage. Here I provide a chronology of cell divisions in Ilyanassa to the stage of 84 cells (about 16 hours after first cleavage at 23°C), and show spatial arrangements of identified nuclei at stages ranging from 27 to 84 cells. During this period the spiral cleavage pattern gives way to a bilaterally symmetric, dorsoventrally polarized pattern of mitotic timing and geometry. At the same time, the mesentoblast cell 4d rapidly proliferates to form twelve cells lying deep to the dorsal ectoderm. The onset of epiboly coincides with a period of mitotic quiescence throughout the ectoderm. As in other gastropod embryos, cell cycle lengths vary widely and predictably according to cell identity, and many of the longest cell cycles occur in small daughters of highly asymmetric divisions. While Ilyanassa shares many features of embryonic cell lineage with two other caenogastropod genera, Crepidula and Bithynia, it is distinguished by a general tendency toward earlier and more pronounced diversification of cell division pattern along axes of later differential growth."
https://openalex.org/W2146378358,"SGK3, which previously has been shown to play a key role in hair follicle development in mice, is a member of the AGC family of serine-threonine kinases. Mice lacking SGK3 have abnormal follicle cycling, which begins shortly after birth and ameliorates substantially with age. However, this developmental abnormality is not recapitulated in mice lacking closely related kinases Akt1, Akt2, or Akt3. To examine whether Akt2 interacts with SGK3 in postnatal hair development, we have generated and characterized Akt2/SGK3 double knockouts (DKOs). We find that the DKO mice have a defect in hair growth that is markedly worse than that of SGK3(-/-) mice and does not ameliorate with age. Morphologically, this defect is characterized by accelerated entry into catagen and through anagen, irregular hair follicle orientation, and increased expression of sebaceous glands. The defect is preceded by a profound failure to increase follicle matrix cell nuclear beta-catenin accumulation and proliferation at the onset of morphogenesis. Furthermore, in cultured keratinocytes, transfected Akt2 and SGK3 both stimulate transcription of a beta-catenin-LEF1-dependent reporter gene. Thus, SGK3 and Akt2 both appear to play important roles in postnatal hair follicle morphogenesis, likely because of their redundant regulation of beta-catenin-dependent transcriptional processes, which control hair follicle cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2157753697,"In eukaryotic genomes, it is challenging to accurately determine target sites of transcription factors (TFs) by only using sequence information. Previous efforts were made to tackle this task by considering the fact that TF binding sites tend to be more conserved than other functional sites and the binding sites of several TFs are often clustered. Recently, ChIP-chip and ChIP-sequencing experiments have been accumulated to identify TF binding sites as well as survey the chromatin modification patterns at the regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers. We propose here a hidden Markov model (HMM) to incorporate sequence motif information, TF-DNA interaction data and chromatin modification patterns to precisely identify cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). We conducted ChIP-chip experiments on four TFs, CREB, E2F1, MAX, and YY1 in 1% of the human genome. We then trained a hidden Markov model (HMM) to identify the labels of the CRMs by incorporating the sequence motifs recognized by these TFs and the ChIP-chip ratio. Chromatin modification data was used to predict the functional sites and to further remove false positives. Cross-validation showed that our integrated HMM had a performance superior to other existing methods on predicting CRMs. Incorporating histone signature information successfully penalized false prediction and improved the whole performance. The dataset we used and the software are available at http://nash.ucsd.edu/CIS/."
https://openalex.org/W1971900812,"The ubiquitin interaction motif-containing protein RAP80 plays a key role in DNA damage response signaling. Using genomic and functional analysis, we established that the expression of the RAP80 gene is regulated in a DNA damage-responsive manner by the master regulator p53. This regulation occurs at the transcriptional level through a noncanonical p53 response element in the RAP80 promoter. Although it is inducible by p53, RAP80 is also able to regulate p53 through an association with both p53 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2, providing HDM2-dependent enhancement of p53 polyubiquitination. Depletion of RAP80 by small interfering RNA stabilizes p53, which, following DNA damage, results in an increased transactivation of several p53 target genes as well as greater apoptosis. Consistent with these observations, exogenous expression of RAP80 selectively inhibits p53-dependent transactivation of target genes in an mdm2-dependent manner in MEF cells. Thus, we identify a new DNA damage-associated role for RAP80. It can function in an autoregulatory loop consisting of RAP80, HDM2, and the p53 master regulatory network, implying an important role for this loop in genome stability and oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2026435880,"Background Recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) is usually administered by injection, and its oral administration in a clinical setting has been not yet reported. Here we demonstrate the bioavailability of orally administered rhGM-CSF in healthy volunteers. The rhGM-CSF was expressed in Bombyx mori expression system (BmrhGM-CSF). Methods and Findings Using a single-dose, randomized, open-label, two-period crossover clinical trial design, 19 healthy volunteers were orally administered with BmrhGM-CSF (8 µg/kg) and subcutaneously injected with rhGM-CSF (3.75 µg/kg) respectively. Serum samples were drawn at 0.0h, 0.5h ,0.75h,1.0h,1.5h,2.0h ,3.0h,4.0h,5.0h,6.0h,8.0h,10.0h and 12.0h after administrations. The hGM-CSF serum concentrations were determined by ELISA. The AUC was calculated using the trapezoid method. The relative bioavailability of BmrhGM-CSF was determined according to the AUC ratio of both orally administered and subcutaneously injected rhGM-CSF. Three volunteers were randomly selected from 15 orally administrated subjects with ELISA detectable values. Their serum samples at the 0.0h, 1.0h, 2.0h, 3.0h and 4.0h after the administrations were analyzed by Q-Trap MS/MS TOF. The different peaks were revealed by the spectrogram profile comparison of the 1.0h, 2.0h, 3.0h and 4.0h samples with that of the 0.0h sample, and further analyzed using both Enhanced Product Ion (EPI) scanning and Peptide Mass Fingerprinting Analysis. The rhGM-CSF was detected in the serum samples from 15 of 19 volunteers administrated with BmrhGM-CSF. Its bioavailability was observed at an average of 1.0%, with the highest of 3.1%. The rhGM-CSF peptide sequences in the serum samples were detected by MS analysis, and their sizes ranging from 2,039 to 7,336 Da. Conclusions The results demonstrated that the oral administered BmrhGM-CSF was absorbed into the blood. This study provides an approach for an oral administration of rhGM-CSF protein in clinical settings. Trial Registration www.chictr.org ChiCTR-TRC-00000107"
