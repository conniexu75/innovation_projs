Isocitric lyase, which catalyzes the reversible cleavage of L,-isocitrate to glyoxylate and succinate, has been identified in a number of molds, and has been purified 70-fold from yeast autolysates. 2. The purified yeast enzyme acts only on n.-isocitric acid and requires magnesium and cysteine for activity. Manganous ions are 40 per cent as active as magnesium, and reduced glu- tathione can replace cysteine. The enzyme is inhibited by low concentrations of copper, cadmium, zinc, p-chloromercuriben- zoate, and o-iodosobenzoate. 3. The biological function of isocitric lyase is discussed, and a possible mechanism for the cleavage of isocitrate involving chelation with magnesium is presented. Acknowledgments-The author appreciates the able assistance of Mr. Joseph Gonzalez in purifying the enzyme and in studying its characteristics, and the courtesy of Dr. Alfred Ritchie in carrying out electrophoretic analyses. He is also indebted to Professor E. B. Chain and Professor Domenico Marotta of the Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy, for encouragement during the initiation of this work. REFERENCES"

The enzyme system catalyzing the condensation of ATP and methionine to form AMe’ has been found in a variety of tissues and organisms, and has been purified from two sources and investigated in detail (7, 8). The broad distribution of these enzymes suggests that AMe likewise has widespread distribution and lends importance to a study of its further metabolism. The present paper reports the presence of an enzyme in baker’s yeast which decomposes AMe to 5’-methylthioadenosine and a-aminobutyrolactone (Equation 1; A = adenine, R = ribose) ."
