https://openalex.org/W1891400877,"A procedure is presented for purifying antithrombin-heparin cofactor from human plasma. The final product is homogeneous as judged by disc gel electrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, and immunoelectrophoresis. The final yield averages 12%. A specific antibody directed against pure inhibitor preparations precipitates virtually all of both antithrombin and heparin cofactor activity from defibrinated plasma. The purification, the immunoprecipitation, and other data, indicate that both activities are properties of a single molecular species. The inhibitor and thrombin form a 1:1 stoichiometric complex which cannot be dissociated with denaturing and reducing agents. Addition of heparin, a widely used anticoagulant which specifically accelerates the action of our inhibitor, increases the rate of formation of this complex without altering its stoichiometry or its dissociability. Interaction of thrombin with antithrombin-heparin cofactor requires the presence of the active center serine of the enzyme and arginine residue(s) on the inhibitor, since chemical modification of either of these critical residues inhibits complex formation both in the presence and absence of heparin. We suggest that, in analogous fashion to trypsin-trypsin inhibitor systems, a specific interaction occurs between the active center serine of thrombin and a unique arginine-x reactive site on the antithrombin-heparin cofactor. Furthermore, lysyl residues of the inhibitor probably serve as a binding site for heparin, since chemical modification of these residues virtually eliminates heparin cofactor activity with only minimal reduction of antithrombin activity. We postulate that heparin binds to the inhibitor and causes a conformational change which results in a more favorable exposure of the arginine reactive site, allowing a rapid interaction with thrombin."

This procedure has been explored with particular reference to the erythrocyte. Both the chemical shift of intracellular inorganic phosphate relative to that of serum phosphate and the positions of, and more especially the difference between, the chemical shifts of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate have been used to monitor intracellular pH of erythrocytes whose hemoglobin has been liganded with carbon monoxide."

The junctional acetylcholine receptors were reduced in the myasthenic muscles as compared with the controls. This reduction in receptors may account for the defect in neuromuscular transmission in myasthenia gravis."
https://openalex.org/W1662998834,"Deoxycholate and Triton X-100 resemble other anionic and neutral amphiphiles in binding to the high affinity sites of native bovine serum albumin. There are four principal sites for each ligand and about 14 weaker sites for deoxycholate; more than half the strong sites are common to each ligand, or octyl and dodecyl sulfates, or both, on the basis of competitive binding studies. On the other hand, cooperative binding of large amounts of ligand with accompanying denaturation, such as is observed for dodecyl sulfate and many other ionic detergents for serum albumin and most other proteins, does not take place with deoxycholate and Triton X-100. The probable reason is that these substances have a relatively low critical micelle concentration, so that a monomeric concentration sufficient for the cooperative mode of binding cannot be attained. The utility of deoxycholate and Triton X-100 for the solubilization of membrane proteins in native or near-native form is consistent with these results."
https://openalex.org/W2062438687,Castrated male rats injected daily with 2 micrograms of estradiol benzoate (EB) combined with 200 micrograms of dihydrotestosterone propionate (DHTP) displayed masculine mating behavior which was indistinguishable from that of other castrates treated with 200 micrograms of testosterone propionate (TP). Significantly less copulation was seen in rats treated with either 4 micrograms of TP plus 200 micrograms of DHTP or 2 micrograms of EB. Mating in male rats may depend on the action of both estrogenic and 5α-dihydro metabolites of testosterone.

The activity of procollagen peptidase, the enzyme that converts procollagen to collagen, is reduced in cultures of fibroblasts. The clinical manifestations of this syndrome may be related to impaired enzymatic conversion of procollagen to collagen. Cultures of skin fibroblasts from these patients have an increased rate of synthesis of collagenous protein (collagen and procollagen), possibly related to the inability of these cells to convert procollagen to collagen."
https://openalex.org/W1674959794,"Abstract Calf brain microtubule protein (tubulin) was characterized chemically. Amino acid analysis and hydrogen ion titration in 5 m guanidine hydrochloride yielded a chemical composition similar to that of tubulin from other sources. The NH2-terminal residue was identified as methionine. When the protein was denatured and reduced in 8 m urea, two distinct protein bands were observed in gel electrophoresis in the presence of urea, suggesting the existence of two nonidentical subunits. The molecular weight of the tubulin subunits was determined by a variety of techniques, including sedimentation equilibrium and light scattering in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, chromatrography on an agarose column in the presence of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and viscometry of S-carboxymethylated, reduced protein in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. All methods yielded an average molecular weight value of (54,000 ± 1,000), whether the measurements were done with or without reducing agents, indicating that all disulfide bonds present are intrachain."
https://openalex.org/W1496421513,"The urea and guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) unfolding of sperm whale ferrimyoglobin and of horse ferrimyoglobin has been studied under equilibrium conditions at both neutral and acid pH. Using two spectral parameters (the Soret absorbance and the molar ellipticity at 222 nm) to monitor conformational equilibria, and various thermodynamic treatments of the resulting data, it was found that the conformational free energy of unfolding, ΔG0 (i.e. the value in the absence of denaturant obtained using the two-state transition model), differs by about 20% in these two proteins. In particular, ΔG0 = 13.6 and 11.0 Cal per mole for sperm whale ferrimyoglobin and horse ferrimyoglobin, respectively. Based on the crystal structure of sperm whale ferrimyoglobin, an analysis of the 19 amino acid differences in the two proteins indicates that sperm whale ferrimyoglobin has a net of two additional arginyl-aspartyl side chain interactions that cannot be realized in horse ferrimyoglobin. Also, sperm whale ferrimyoglobin is predicted to be approximately 0.8 Cal per mole more stable than horse ferrimyoglobin due to an internal residue and several surface contact residues of higher hydrophobicity than the corresponding groups in horse ferrimyoglobin. Thus, the experimental free energy difference of 2.6 Cal per mole in the two proteins can be qualitatively explained, although minor conformation differences in localized regions of the native structures may exist. The acid unfolding of the two proteins can be described reasonably well in terms of six abnormal histidyl groups in each protein. These groups titrate with apparent pK values of 5.9 in the unfolded proteins and 3.0 and 3.7, respectively, in native sperm whale ferrimyoglobin and horse ferrimyoglobin. Corrections for the electrostatic free energy of the protein give an intrinsic pK of 6.6 for these groups in the unfolded state. A slightly better fit to the acid unfolding data could be achieved by considering two other classes, each containing 6 partially masked residues. The ΔG0 obtained from acid unfolding was in good agreement with that found from urea and GuHCl unfolding at neutral pH. These results show that conservative mutations can have pronounced effects on the conformational stability of phylogenetically similar globular proteins. However, in spite of the significant difference in ΔG0 of these two myoglobins, it is known that the oxygenation free energy differs by only a few per cent. Thus, these data demonstrate that in the myoglobins the evolutionary constraints are such that little variation is permitted in the biological function, but that appreciable variation is allowed in parts of the primary structure with concomitant changes in stability and perhaps small changes in conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1970895519,Cells from a rat pituitary tumor cell line will respond in vitro to physiological concentrations of L-thyroxine and L-triiodothyronine. The cells are grown in a culture medium that contains serum from a hypothyroid calf. Dose-response relationships of a variety of thyronine derivatives indicate that this system has a specificity of response which is similar to that observed in vitro.
https://openalex.org/W1497913552,"Abstract Rat fibroblasts contain proteins of long and short half-lives, and these two populations can be labeled selectively. Fresh medium contains a factor that inhibits the breakdown of those proteins with long half-lives but has no effect on the rate of breakdown of proteins of short half-lives. Fluoride inhibits the breakdown of both classes of proteins to about the same extent. This effect is immediately reversible, in contrast to the slow reversal of fluoride inhibition of protein synthesis. Iodoacetate also inhibits the breakdown of both classes of proteins to the same extent. The degree of inhibition of protein breakdown by fluoride and iodoacetate does not parallel the effects of these substances on the cellular ATP level. Fluoride causes relatively more inhibition of protein breakdown and relatively less reduction in ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1569915920,"Abstract Using in vivo saturation techniques we have previously demonstrated limited capacity nuclear binding sites which exhibit a high degree of specificity for l-triiodothyronine and only minimal cross-reaction with l-thyroxine. The current studies were designed to determine the intranuclear localization of the specifically bound triiodothyronine in liver nuclei. Rat liver nuclei were isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation 30 min after injection of a small dose (less than 130 ng/100 g body weight) of [125I]triiodothyronine or [131I]thyroxine. These nuclei were treated sequentially with 0.2% Triton X-100 to remove the outer membrane, 0.15 n NaCl and 0.1 m Tris, to extract nucleoplasmic and ribonucleoproteins. After a small dose of triiodothyronine had been injected, 50 to 70% of the nuclear [125I]triiodothyronine resisted extraction by these agents and remained with the residual chromatin pellet. The chromatin localization of triiodothyronine was not a result of in vitro distribution of tracer since more than 50% of nuclear [125I]triiodothyronine was recovered with purified chromatin which was isolated by discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation from nuclei disrupted by hypotonic shock. Moreover, when a large dose of triiodothyronine was injected (more than 8000 ng/100 g body weight), 70 to 90% of the nuclear radioactivity was removed by Triton X-100. [131I]Triiodothyronine which was added to the nuclei in vitro was similarly removed by Triton X-100. Finally, when a small dose of [131I]thyroxine was injected, most of this iodothyronine was also recovered with the nuclear outer membrane. These data thus suggest that specifically bound triiodothyronine is associated with the chromatin whereas nonspecific binding of either triiodothyronine or thyroxine occurs at the nuclear outer membrane. When nuclei previously labeled in vivo with a small dose of [125I]triiodothyronine were extracted with 0.4 m KCl, 60 to 80% of the nuclear [125I]triiodothyronine was removed. The [125I]triiodothyronine extracted by KCl appeared bound to a macromolecule since more than 80% of the radioactivity in these extracts was excluded from small Sephadex G-50 columns. The nuclear triiodothyronine-macromolecular complex was unstable at 25 to 37°. The instability appeared related to breakdown of the nuclear protein since the loss of [125I]triiodothyronine-macromolecular complexes was paralleled by a loss of protein from the excluded volume of these columns. Attempts to reduce the instability of these complexes with iodoacetate, mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, rat serum, or glycerol were unsuccessful. The binding of [125I]triiodothyronine was disrupted after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and was unaffected by DNase or RNase. Moreover, the efficiency of the KCl extraction was substantially enhanced in mild alkaline conditions. Thus the specific nuclear triiodothyronine binding site appears to be a chromatin non-histone protein. The apparent molecular weight of the nuclear [125I]triiodothyronine-protein complex appears to be 60,000 to 70,000 as determined by gel filtration. The specific association of triiodothyronine with chromatin non-histone proteins localizes triiodothyronine to the genome and raises the possibility that this association is related to the increase in DNA transcription which occurs after triiodothyronine administration."
https://openalex.org/W1547218668,"Abstract The reaction of porcine pancreatic lipase B (EC 3.1.1.3) with the soluble triglyceride, tripropionin, shows substantial stimulation in the presence of hydrophobic surfaces. The enhancement of the enzymatic rate can be correlated with the reversible binding of the enzyme to the hydrophobic surface with a dissociation constant K = 1.3 x 10-8 m. The binding of the enzyme to the surface is diffusion controlled with a rate constant of 1.8 x 106 m-1 s-1. At saturation of the surface with enzyme each protein molecule occupies an average area of 6000 A2 per molecule. The hydrolytic reaction on the surface is first order with respect to the amount of adsorbed enzyme and the concentration of tripropionin at the solution-solid interface. The second order rate constant of the reaction is 1.3 x 1013 cm2 mole-1 s-1. The surface reaction requires a basic group on the enzyme with a pK of 5.85. The enhancement of the velocity on the surface as compared to the homogeneous reaction can be ascribed to an increased local concentration of the substrate at the liquid-solid interface."
https://openalex.org/W1583991450,"Abstract An unambiguous assignment of the product-precursor relationship is made for each step in the activation of prothrombin with Factor Xa. Prothrombin and each of its activation intermediates were reacted with trypsin-produced Factor Xa and with thrombin. [3H]Diisopropylphosphorofluoridate incorporation studies were performed to identify the active thrombin produced from its precursors. The results obtained allow us to order the events of the activation process in terms of the production of the intermediates of the activation process previously described by this laboratory (Mann, K. G., Heldebrant, C. M., and Fass, D. N. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 6106–6114). The initial activation step, the conversion of prothrombin to Intermediate 1 and Intermediate 3 may be catalyzed by either Factor Xa or by thrombin, however, later activation steps require Factor Xa as the catalytic agent. Treatment of prothrombin with thrombin yields two fragments which are indistinguishable from those produced by Factor Xa. Intermediate 4, a previously unreported activation fragment, is produced concomitant with Intermediate 2 during cleavage of Intermediate 1 with Factor Xa. Intermediate 2 and Intermediate 4 are readily resolved by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The intermediates derived from prothrombin by citrate-Factor Xa activation (Interemdiates 1, 2, 3, and 4) or by the action of thrombin (Intermediates 1t and 3t) have also been characterized with respect to their molecular weights, amino acid compositions, and NH2-terminal amino acid residues. The NH2-terminal amino acids and the molecular weights are: prothrombin-alanine, 70,000; Intermediate 1-serine, 51,000; Intermediate 1t-serine, 51,000; Intermediate 2-threonine, 41,000; Intermediate 3-alanine, 23,000; Intermediate 3t-alanine, 23,000; Intermediate 4, 13,000. The sum of the molecular weights and amino acid compositions of the products are equivalent to the molecular weight and amino acid composition of the proposed precursor (within experimental error) in every case. Intermediates 1 and 1t, and Intermediates 3 and 3t are indistinguishable in every analysis, and appear to be identical. Furthermore, the intermediates produced by other activators appear to be identical to those produced by citrate-Factor Xa activation. The NH2-terminal amino acid residues of prothrombin and the intermediates permit the formulation of a structural model of prothrombin and the activation process which indicates that the activation proceeds by the sequential cleavage of portions of the NH2-terminal regions of prothrombin and the intermediates. These results support a mechanism in which prothrombin is first cleaved, either by Factor Xa or thrombin, to yield Intermediate 1 from its COOH-terminal region and Intermediate 3 from its NH2-terminal region. Intermediate 1 is then cleaved by Factor Xa to yield Intermediate 2 from its COOH-terminal region and Intermediate 4 from its NH2-terminal region. Intermediate 2, the immediate thrombin precursor, which contains the A chain of α-thrombin as its NH2-terminal segment, and the B chain of α-thrombin as its COOH-terminal segment, is then cleaved by Factor Xa to generate the active, two-chain α-thrombin molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1537415606,"Abstract Cultured human cells treated with two specific, competitive inhibitors of amino acid activation, histidinol and O-methylthreonine, exhibit a decrease in the rate of translational initiation. This effect on translational initiation appears to be the same as that induced by depriving such cells of single essential amino acids, including the two affected by the inhibitor, histidine and isoleucine. When the degree of charging of tRNAhis or tRNAileu is reduced with inhibitor by 20% or more, relative to untreated cells, there is a 4-fold or greater reduction in the relative rate of translational initiation, affecting translation of at least a majority of the mRNA in polysomes. This repression of initiation correlated with the appearance of uncharged tRNA does not appear to involve the destruction of mRNA or other RNA required for initiation, a decrease in available free ribosomal subunits, or a decrease in cellular ATP or GTP. A cumulative inhibition of protein synthesis is observed when both amino acid activation inhibitors are added to a culture. This control is present in cultured human cells derived from both normal and malignant tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1548234693,"Abstract A glycoprotein was isolated from human group O erythrocyte membranes previously treated with detergents by a mild extraction with 90% phenol and further purified by successive passages through columns of DEAE-, CM-Sephadex, and Sephadex G-100 followed by a chloroform-methanol extraction. The purified glycoprotein appeared to be a single molecular species in gel filtration, polyacrylamide electrophoresis, and ultracentrifugation, and a molecular weight of 53,000 was estimated by sedimentation equilibrium experiments in the presence of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. This glycoprotein, which contains 55% carbohydrate, has H and MN blood group activities and carries the receptors for various phytohemagglutinins. After alkaline, reductive degradation of the glycoprotein, the blood group H and MN activities were greatly diminished, whereas the inhibitory activities against certain phytohemagglutinins, especially concanavalin A, were remarkably enhanced, indicating that the antigenic receptors of the former blood group activities clearly reside in alkali-labile O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharide chains and the receptors for the latter phytohemagglutinins mostly reside in alkali-stable N-glycosidically linked oligosaccharide chains. The purified glycoprotein was also found to be a potent inhibitor for [3H]thymidine incorporation in human lymphocytes stimulated by various phytomitogens and anti-lymphocyte serum."
https://openalex.org/W1566602444,"Abstract Replication of polydeoxynucleotide templates catalyzed by the low molecular weight DNA polymerase from calf thymus chromatin proceeds only in the presence of a complementary initiator, complementary deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and a divalent cation. The minimum chain length of an initiator for initiation of polydeoxyadenylate is 7. Kinetic studies show a single binding site for deoxynucleoside triphosphate and one binding site for the template initiator. The Km for monomers varies from 28 to 42 µm. The Km for the template is about 1000-fold lower than for the monomer and is not markedly affected by base composition. The low molecular weight DNA polymerase does not have an associated 3'- to 5'-exonuclease function, enhancing the possibility for replicative errors. Several error mechanisms have been detected. When a mismatched nucleotide is present at the 3' terminus of the initiator molecule reaction does occur, and the initiator molecule with the mismatched nucleotide at the 3' terminus is incorporated into the product chain. In the absence of the complementary deoxynucleoside triphosphate the enzyme carries out a addition reaction at the 3' termini of initiated templates. The limited addition reaction is stimulated by the presence of the deoxynucleoside triphosphate complementary to the template, requires the presence of an initiated template, increases with increasing concentration of deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and is higher in Mn2+-catalyzed reactions than in Mg2+-catalyzed reactions. Nearest neighbor analyses on the products of homopolymer replication show that the 3'-termini of both the template chain and the product chain are used for this limited addition. A conservative estimate of the fidelity of the low molecular weight DNA polymerase in the poly(dA) replication is obtained by the thymidine to cytosine or thymidine to guanine ratio in the product, where C or G is the mismatched monomer found as the 3' neighbor to T. The T/C ratio is about 120,000 and T/G is about 10,000 in the products of Mn2+-catalyzed poly(dA) replication. In the products of Mg2+-catalyzed poly(dA) replication, the T/C ratio is about 180,000 and the T/G ratio is about 100,000."
https://openalex.org/W1524946685,"Several investigators suggested that labeled amino acids are incorporated into protein without first equilibrating with the intracellular pool. Experiments were performed to determine if the intracellular or extracellular [14C]tyrosine represented the precursor for protein synthesis in muscle. Four pieces of rat diaphragm were incubated in the same concentration of [3H]leucine but in different concentrations of [14C]tyrosine. The rates of [3H]leucine incorporation were similar in all the muscles, indicating similar rates of protein synthesis. The 14C counts in protein increased with increasing tyrosine concentrations in the medium, but the moles of tyrosine incorporated into protein were similar only when the counts in protein were divided by the intracellular specific activity. In other experiments muscles were incubated with [3H]leucine and [14C]tyrosine, and then transferred to medium containing [3H]leucine and unlabeled tyrosine. The rate of tyrosine incorporation agreed with leucine incorporation only when calculations used the intracellular tyrosine specific activity. Therefore, the free intracellular tyrosine resembled a precursor for protein synthesis, while the extracellular did not. However, this conclusion did not hold during very short incubations or incubations with low concentrations of tyrosine in the medium, for reasons suggested herein."

https://openalex.org/W2129163695,"Abstract Human hemoglobin has been reacted with potassium cyanate and purified to yield three species, α2cβ2c,α2cβ2, and α2β2c, where superscript c denotes specific reaction of cyanate with the α-amino group of the particular chain. The effect of carbon dioxide on the oxygen affinity of these species in the presence and in the absence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate has been measured. Carbon dioxide has no effect on the oxygen affinity of α2cβ2c, confirming that the usual lowering of the oxygen affinity of carbon dioxide in normal hemoglobin is mediated by the α-amino groups of the α and β chains. The lowering of the oxygen affinity of α2β2c by carbon dioxide was not affected by the presence or absence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, showing that 2,3-diphosphoglycerate does not interfere with the oxygen-linked binding of carbon dioxide at the α chain α-amino group. In α2cβ2 there was a much larger effect of carbon dioxide on the oxygen affinity in the absence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate than in α2β2c; however, on addition of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate the effect of carbon dioxide on the oxygen affinity of α2cβ2 was much smaller and similar to that occurring in α2β2c. This shows that there is a large difference in the carbon dioxide binding constants of the β chain α-amino group in the oxy and deoxy forms of human hemoglobin, and that 2,3-diphosphoglycerate suppresses this difference, probably by binding strongly to the β chain α-amino group of deoxyhemoglobin and displacing any bound carbon dioxide."
https://openalex.org/W1517862184,"Abstract There are at least three electrophoretically distinguishable mammalian isozymes of pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40). One of these, the type L isozyme, has been associated with the parenchymal cells of rodent livers. We have isolated and purified the equivalent isozyme from bovine liver. Like other mammalian type L pyruvate kinases, this enzyme exhibits cooperative kinetics with its substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and is activated by fructose 1,6-diphosphate. We find a Michaelis constant for P-enolpyruvate of about 0.08 mm in the presence of 1 mm fructose 1,6-diphosphate, and half-maximal activity at 0.5 mm P-enolpyruvate in the absence of fructose 1,6-diphosphate. Bovine type L pyruvate kinase has a sedimentation coefficient of 9.5 S at a concentration near 0.5 mg per ml in the analytical ultracentrifuge, and a molecular weight from sedimentation equilibrium of about 215,000 based on a partial specific volume (estimated from amino acid analyses) of 0.737 ml per g. It is dissociated by guanidine hydrochloride into subunits with a molecular weight of approximately 54,000 using the same partial specific volume. Measurements of the Hill coefficient are consistent with the presence of four substrate binding sites on the liver isozyme, or an average of one per subunit. Thus, the liver isozyme appears to have the same subunit structure and number of binding sites as the skeletal muscle isozyme. Hybrids of the skeletal muscle and type L isozymes are of interest because the former enzyme exhibits Michaelis-Menten kinetics with its substrates while the liver isozyme behaves allosterically. Hybrids of these two enzymes were produced in vitro by denaturing them together in guanidine hydrochloride, followed by dilution into a renaturing medium containing a reducing reagent and Tris-HCl at pH 7.5. One-half or more of the original activity was recovered. After electrophoresis of the renatured mixture, an enzyme-specific detection procedure revealed five isozymes, consisting of L4, L3M, L2M2, LM3, and M4, where L4 and M4 are the native tetrameric liver and skeletal muscle isozymes, respectively. Densitometric measurements of the electrophoretic pattern suggest hybrid amounts that are consistent with a random redistribution of parental subunits. This result implies that, in spite of significant differences in physical and chemical properties, the liver and skeletal muscle isozymes are very similar, at least near regions of intersubunit contact."

https://openalex.org/W1970208709,"Abstract Studies were undertaken to characterize the effect of vincristine on methotrexate uptake in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells and to define the mechanism of this interaction. Vincristine (10 µm) does not alter the unidirectional influx of methotrexate but slows the unidirectional efflux of methotrexate and leads to a large increase in the steady state level of exchangeable intracellular methotrexate. These effects of vincristine are rapidly, but not completely, reversible. Vincristine stimulation of net methotrexate uptake occurs within 4 min of exposure of cells to this agent and increases over an extracellular vincristine concentration range of at least 5 to 50 µm. Vincristine does not alter the intracellular water content nor the chloride distribution ratio. The addition of glucose to the medium partially reverses the effect of vincristine and completely reverses the stimulatory effect of sodium azide on the net uptake of methotrexate. Vincristine (10 µm) increases net uptake of methotrexate in L1210 leukemia cells but does not have a significant effect on net methotrexate uptake in the L-cell mouse fibroblast over a 2½-hour interval of exposure even though replication of the L-cell is completely arrested. The similarity between the effects of vincristine and metabolic poisons on methotrexate uptake and the partial reversal of the effect of vincristine by glucose suggest that this agent enhances methotrexate uptake by the inhibition of cellular energy metabolism with the consequent inhibition of an energy-dependent process which limits methotrexate accumulation within the cell. The data suggest further that this effect of vincristine represents an interaction with a cellular element(s) that is different from the interaction which results in the arrest of cell division in metaphase."

https://openalex.org/W1544740422,"Abstract The observed equilibrium constants (Kobs) of the malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37), citrate synthase (EC 4.1.3.7) and citrate lyase (EC 4.1.3.6) reactions have been determined under near physiological conditions (38°, pH 7.0, I = 0.25, free [Mg2+] = 10-3 m). From these values the observed standard free energy change (ΔG0obs) for the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA has been determined. Under the above conditions, and taking the standard state of liquid water to have activity = unity ([H2O] = 1), the equilibrium constants of the three reactions at pH 7.0 may be written: Malate dehydrogenase Kobs = [Oxaloacetate][NADH]/[Malate][NAD+] = 2.86 ± 0.12 x 10-5 Citrate synthase Kobs = [Citrate][CoA]/[Oxaloacetate][Acetyl-CoA][H2O] = 2.24 ± 0.11 x 106 Citrate lyase Kobs = [Citrate]/[Oxaloacetate][Acetate] = 2.22 ± 0.16 m-1 where the concentration of each substrate represents the total of all the ionic species present, both acid forms and magnesium complexes. The values obtained for Kobs of the citrate synthase and citrate lyase reactions vary to the same extent with the changes in magnesium concentration. At free [Mg2+] = 0, Kobs for the citrate synthase reaction is 1.01 ± 0.05 x 106 and the Kobs for the citrate lyase reaction is 1.00 ± 0.07 m-1. In contrast, malate dehydrogenase is unaffected by the concentration of free Mg2+ up to 4 mm. From the constants of the citrate synthase and citrate lyase reactions, the Kobs for the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA under near physiological conditions is calculated to be 1.01 x 106 m, corresponding to a free energy change of -8.54 Cal per mole (-35.75 kJ per mole) independent of the free magnesium concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1498587762,"Abstract The phospholipase A1 of rat liver plasma membranes was stimulated 2- to 3-fold by physiologic concentrations of heparin (1 to 2.4 µg per ml for humans). The stimulation did not change appreciably with increasing enzyme or substrate concentration, nor with the time of incubation. However, activation of hydrolysis by Ca2+ was altered by the addition of heparin. Treatment of the plasma membranes with heparin displaced the enzyme from the membrane which accounts for the stimulation of heparin. Heparin at high concentrations inhibited the enzyme. The amount of [35S]-heparin bound to the membrane (about 10 µg per mg of plasma membrane protein) was the same as the amount required for maximal stimulation and solubilization of the membrane-bound enzyme. The enzyme freed from the membrane was stimulated only 2-fold by Ca2+. Gel filtration of the solubilized enzyme indicated that the enzyme was heterogenous in size. Linoleic acid, NaCl, albumin, deoxycholate, and protamine inhibited the activity of the enzyme. Protamine prevented binding of heparin to the membrane and probably blocked displacement of the enzyme from the membrane. We believe our results support the hypothesis that the liver plasma membrane is the origin of the postheparin phospholipase A1."
https://openalex.org/W1551471029,"Abstract From the variation of ultraviolet absorbance with pH, the following pK values at 25° were determined: methotrexate, 5.71; folate, 8.38; and dihydrofolate, 9.54. The dependence of the proton magnetic resonance spectrum of these three folates on pH and concentration was measured. At infinite dilution, the folate spectra had little dependence on pH, but had a large dependence on pH at non-zero concentrations. The dependencies of chemical shift on pH and concentration were successfully fitted to dimerization and protonation equations with the following association constants which were determined at 23° in 2H2O at ionic strength of 0.1 to 0.5 m; folate, basic form 340 ± 40 mm, neutral form 19.4 ± 1.4 mm; dihydrofolate, neutral form, 38.5 ± 1.5 mm; methotrexate, neutral form 61.5 ± 1.5 mm, acidic form 11.0 ± 1.5 mm. A molecular structure for the neutral dimer of folate is proposed; the structure has two folates in a fully stretched out configuration with vertical ring stacking in a coplanar fashion, one molecule above the other in a head-to-tail arrangement. Similar structures for the other dimers are proposed. The dimers appear to be in rapid equilibrium with the monomers."

When the cells were washed with 0.05 m MgSO4 to deplete them of K+ and then were suspended with aeration in the buffered Complete Salts Solution, the intracellular Na+ and K+ concentrations were initially 0.3 and 0.004 m, respectively. On further incubation, the intracellular K+ concentration increased without a lag while the Na+ concentration, after a lag decreased until the ion concentrations prevailing in freshly harvested and aerated cells were obtained. The rate of uptake of K+ by and expulsion of Na+ from the cells was increased by adding ethanol, an oxidizable substrate, to the suspending medium. The Km and Vmax for α-aminoisobutyric acid transport into freshly harvested and aerated cells of the marine pseudomonad were essentially unchanged when the Na+ and K+ concentrations in the suspending medium were changed from those present in the Complete Salts Solution to those prevailing inside the cells. Thus the Na+ + K+ gradients are not required for α-aminoisobutyric acid accumulation, a Na+-dependent process. Cells suspended in the Complete Salts Solution from which KCl was omitted lost K+ at a slow constant rate which was not enhanced by α-aminoisobutyric acid uptake or the addition of NaCN."

https://openalex.org/W1490492620,"Abstract The methylglucose-containing lipopolysaccharide (MGLP) of Mycobacterium phlei is an acidic molecule with 18 hexose units. Four forms (MGLP-I to MGLP-IV) exist with from 0 to 3 moles of esterified succinate. Each form is also acylated with acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, and octanoate, totaling 6 moles. Eight positions of acylation have been ascertained by methyl replacement (Gray, G. R., and Ballou, C. E. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 8129–8135). Six of these positions are now shown to be acylated specifically with monobasic acids and two others specifically with acidic succinyl groups. In addition, another site of succinylation has been found, which accounts for the nine positions in MGLP-IV. Characterization of newly methylated fragments produced by methyl replacement and Smith degradation of MGLP-I, which does not contain succinate, was used to determine placement of the neutral acyl groups. To complement these studies, we characterized the neutral acylated fragments isolated from a mixture of Smith-degraded MGLP-I and II, which were isotopically labeled in the various monobasic acyl groups. The positions at which succinate was esterified were determined by characterization of acidic acylated products resulting from Smith degradation of MGLP-II which contained labeled succinate. Our results indicate that the monobasic acids were esterified at positions 4 and 6 of the 3-O-methylglucose unit, and at position 6 of the 3 adjacent glucose residues at the 3-O-methylglucose end of the chain. An additional neutral acyl group (probably the octanoate) was esterified to position 3 of the glyceric acid. Propionate was found in two of the positions of acylation nearest the 3-O-methylglucose end of MGLP, indicating that there was some heterogeneity in the placement of monobasic acids among these sites since only 1 mole of propionate is normally present. Succinate was esterified at position 6 of the remaining glucose residues near the glyceric acid end of the molecule. MGLP-II, which contains only 1 mole of succinate per mole of polysaccharide, was succinylated to some extent at each of these three positions. The nonrandom distribution of monobasic versus dibasic acids provides support for the concept that a defined placement of esters is in some way related to the biological function of the lipopolysaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1527109375,"Abstract When preparations of human prothrombin are rapidly activated to thrombin (EC 3.4.4.13) in the presence of a partially purified enzyme from Taipan snake venom (Oxyuranus scutellatus scutellatus), the thrombin activity isolated from the activation mixture by ion exchange chromatography is associated with a single molecule of molecular weight of approximately 39,000. The subunit structure of this blood-clotting enzyme was examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis and was found to consist of two polypeptide chains connected by disulfide bonds, of molecular weight of approximately 32,000 and 7,000. NH2-terminal amino acid analysis by the 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl procedure indicated that the larger chain contained NH2-terminal isoleucine while the smaller chain contained NH2-terminal threonine. With time, the enzyme self-digests itself without change in the clotting activity of the system to produce a smaller thrombin molecule of molecular weight of approximately 26,000, which consists of a 19,000 and a 7,000 molecular weight peptide with NH2-terminal isoleucine and threonine, respectively. The other peptide, which is inactive against fibrinogen, is split from the larger chain of the parent molecule presumably because of autolysis. It was found to have a molecular weight of approximately 11,000 and to contain a single NH2-terminal glycine. These structural changes were confirmed by isolation of the various thrombin peptides by gel filtration in 10% acetic acid. Slow and incomplete activation of human prothrombin in the presence of concentrated citrate solution or activation with a human Factor Xa preparation results in the isolation of a mixture of both thrombin molecules from the activation systems, including the inactive thrombin peptide. These molecules showed the same sequence of structural changes due to autolysis without a corresponding change in clotting activity as did the venom-derived enzyme. Thrombin preparations containing a mixture of the larger and smaller molecules, particularly those in which the smaller molecule predominates, have a significantly higher clotting activity than preparations containing only the larger molecule. No evidence was obtained for the existence of a three-chain polypeptide human thrombin molecule as has been reported by others for the bovine enzyme. Since preliminary observations seemed to indicate that under our conditions of study bovine and horse thrombin preparations contain similar species of molecules as those described above for human thrombin, methods of preparation of prothrombin or activation (or both) employed by others may account for this apparent discrepancy. These studies suggest that the thrombin derived from human, bovine, and possibly horse prothrombin appear quite similar in size, NH2-terminal amino acids, and subunit structure, their relative composition in a prothrombin activation mixture being dependent only upon the rate or yield (or both) of thrombin generated from its zymogen, rather than the source of activators."
https://openalex.org/W1584299655,"The monitoring requirements related to air pollution are many and varied. The molecules of concern differ greatly in their chemical and physical properties, in the nature of their environment, and in their concentration ranges. Furthermore, the application may have specific requirements such as rapid response time, ultrasensitivity, multipollutant capability, or capability for remote measurements. For these reasons, no single spectroscopic technique appears to offer a panacea for all monitoring needs. Instead we have attempted to demonstrate in the above discussion that, regardless of the difficulty and complexity of the monitoring problems, spectroscopy offers many tools by which such problems may be solved."
https://openalex.org/W1591687421,"Abstract A cell-line in culture derived from adult rat liver was used as a source of a pyruvate kinase isoenzyme (PK-III) for kinetic studies. The culture conditions of the cells were found to affect the kinetic properties of the enzyme in a crude preparation. When the enzyme was extracted from cells maintained without glucose in the medium the substrate-velocity curve with phosphoenolpyruvate was sigmoidal in shape with an apparent Km of 0.33 mm. However, when the enzyme was extracted from cells maintained in the presence of glucose up to the time of harvest the substrate-velocity curve was hyperbolic with an apparent Km of 0.05 mm. These two forms have been designated PK-IIIa and PK-IIIb, respectively, and appear to be the same as two similar forms known to exist in adipose tissue. Differences in inhibition by ATP and the amino acids l-alanine and l-phenylalanine were found. The IIIa form of the enzyme was more susceptible to the inhibitors than the IIIb form. Fructose diphosphate was able to relieve amino acid inhibition of PK-IIIb but not of PK-IIIa. The two forms of the enzyme were found to be interconvertible in vitro. The A to B transition could be mediated by fructose-P2 or by magnesium ions, whilst the B to A transition was mediated by EDTA, ATP, or citrate. The possible role of these two forms of the enzyme in metabolic regulation is discussed with the proposal that PK-IIIa is the inactive form of the enzyme and must be converted to PK-IIIb for enzyme activity."

The active lipids were isolated by chloroform-methanol extraction, partition with aqueous KCl followed by precipitation of the polar lipids with acetone. Then the A active glycolipids were purified by DEAE-cellulose and Florisil column chromatography. Final purification of the A active compounds was achieved by sequential preparative thin layer chromatography in two solvent systems. The homogeneity of the purified fractions was confirmed by thin layer chromatography in neutral, acidic, and basic solvent systems, thin layer chromatography of the acetylated derivatives of the purified fractions and by osmium-catalyzed periodate oxidation followed by paper chromatography of the released oligosaccharide chains. Two similar but distinct A active glycolipid fractions (L and U) were isolated. Fraction U contained high amounts of long chain hydroxy fatty acids, while Fraction L was rich in C16-C18 fatty acids. Sphingenine and heptadecasphinganine were the major long chain bases found in both fractions. The carbohydrate composition of Fractions L and U was identical and was found to be (in moles per 1 mole of glucose): galactose, 3.04; fucose, 1.09, N-acetylglucosamine, 0.99, N-acetyl-galactosamine, 0.93. Partial acid hydrolysis, mild acid hydrolysis, enzymatic digestion, and immunological assays established the following carbohydrate sequence for the A active glycosphingolipid isolated from hog stomach mucosa powder: [see PDF for sequence]"

https://openalex.org/W1548276900,"Abstract The results of peptide map patterns, end group analysis, and disc electrophoresis experiments in gels containing 8 m urea show that serine transhydroxymethylase from rabbit liver consists of four identical polypeptide chains. Evidence is presented to show that serine transhydroxymethylase can exist in an oxidized form and a reduced form. The oxidized form is about 60% as active as the reduced form but can be converted to the reduced form by incubation with a sulfhydryl compound, such as dithiothreitol, and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. In the absence of a sulfhydryl compound the reduced enzyme is converted to the oxidized enzyme over a period of several weeks at -5°. The apoenzyme is converted to the oxidized form in a few hours. The reduced enzyme has 12 sulfhydryl groups which react with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Kinetically they are of two classes. Eight of these sulfhydryl groups react rapidly and four more slowly. The oxidized enzyme has only eight sulfhydryl groups which react with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), four reacting rapidly and four more slowly. The reaction of the enzyme with 5,5'-dithiobis(2nitrobenzoic acid) causes dissociation of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and complete loss of enzymatic activity."

https://openalex.org/W1485653425,"Abstract Pyruvate kinase, which has an absolute requirement for both a monovalent and a divalent cation for activity, can be activated by the monomethylammonium cation at a rate 0.5% that measured in the presence of K+. The kinetically determined dissociation constant for the monovalent activator in the presence of saturating substrates (K1 = 85 mm) agrees with that measured for K+ and the dissociation constant measured in the presence of saturating substrates and the divalent activator Mn2+, (K4 = 20.5 ± 3.3 mm) is somewhat larger than that for K+. The presence of carbonbound protons on the movovalent activator permits the investigation of the interaction of the monovalent activator with the enzyme-Mn2+ complexes by proton nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The presence of the enzyme has no effect on the longitudinal (1/T1) and transverse (1/T2) relaxation rates of the carbon-bound protons. The formation of the enzyme-Mn2+ complex increases the relaxation rates due to the electron-nuclear dipolar interaction of the paramagnetic Mn2+ and the protons. In the presence of the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate, the relaxation rates are even further increased. A measure of the relaxation rates at two frequencies allows the evaluation of the correlation time for the electron-nuclear interaction, τc by several methods. No significant change in the correlation time is seen when the substrate complex is formed. The electron-nuclear distance can thus be evaluated from the correlation time, τc, and from the values measured for 1/T1. In the absence of substrate the protons of the methyl group are 8.3 ± 0.6 A from the enzyme-bound Mn2+. Upon formation of the pyruvate kinase-Mn2+-phosphoenolpyruvate complex, the protons move to 6.6 ± 0.2 A of the Mn2+. This result shows that the substrate affects the conformation of the active site by bringing the monovalent and divalent cation activators in closer proximity and that the monovalent activator can indeed bind in the active site of pyruvate kinase. The Mn2+-methyl proton distance measured is that predicted if the monovalent cation acts by binding P-enolpyruvate via the carboxyl group to form the active complex (Nowak, T., and Mildvan, A. S. (1972) Biochemistry 11, 2819). Monomethylammonium ion can thus serve as a useful probe in studying the interactions of monovalent cations with many biological systems with relative ease and should lead to a greater understanding of monovalent cation activation and function in biology."

https://openalex.org/W1486641546,"Abstract The enzyme, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconic aldolase is inactivated by the substrate analog, bromopyruvate. Inactivation results from either an active site carboxyl group or a cysteine being alkylated by bromopyruvate. Treatment of enzyme inactivated by carboxylate ester formation with borohydride produces the secondary amine resulting from reduction of a Schiff's base between the covalently fixed carboxyketomethyl group and the e-amino group of lysine. This is evidenced by the presence of N6-(1'-carboxy-2'-hydroxy)ethyl lysine in hydrolysates of inactivated, reduced enzyme. However, reduction of enzyme inactivated by thioether formation does not produce a secondary amine. These results then constitute chemical evidence that the carboxylate occurs adjacent to an active site lysine residue, which is the azomethine-forming lysine, while the bromopyruvate-sensitive cysteine is elsewhere in the active site environment."
https://openalex.org/W1565870903,"Abstract Conformational changes produced by acid-base reaction with serum albumin and myoglobin generate volume effects which are unique and characteristic for the given systems. The volume changes were determined with dilatometers which could be read to 0.01 µl; the experiments were performed at 30.0 ± 0.001°. The acid induced N-F produced by serum albumin in water elicits an attenuation of the volume isotherm in the region bounded by pH 3.0 to 3.7. The use of 8 m urea and 6 m guanidine hydrochloride virtually eliminated this effect. The titration of serum albumin with alkali caused anomalous volume effects which indicated at least two transitions; namely, the neutral transition generated as the pH is increased from pH 5 to pH 9 and a second which occurs at pH values greater than pH 10.8. The reaction of acid with sperm whale myoglobin in water causes bizarre volume effects, i.e. a quasi-sinusoidal isotherm is generated as a function of hydrogen ion concentration. The small initial volume rise is followed by a sharp volume decrease which is due to the structural associated with the normalizing of the six imidazoles in myoglobin. Similar experiments performed in 8 m urea reveal the retention of some degree of organized structure which is disrupted by increasing proton concentration. The structural transitions were time-dependent; this is in contrast to the other systems which reached steady state within several minutes after reaction. Myoglobin in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride did not exhibit any evidence of structural upon titration with acid; there was good agreement between the observed and calculated volume effects. The alkaline titration of myoglobin in water produced a monotonic volume rise with increasing concentrations of bound OH-. However, similar studies employing 8 m urea as solvent revealed a at the point where 45 moles of OH- were bound/ 105 g of myoglobin; this was interpreted as being caused by the release of 34 prototropic groups/105 g of proteins. The volume effects associated with the various transitions are the summation of such processes as the change of the partial molar volume of the protein, normalizing of masked ionic groups, electrostriction effects, and other less well defined phenomena arising from the alteration of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1513100178,"Abstract A particulate enzyme preparation was obtained from Mycobacterium phlei cells which had the activity of a polysaccharide:acyl coenzyme A acyltransferse. We conclude that the enzyme system is involved in the biosynthesis of the methylglucose-containing lipopolysaccharide (MGLP), since it catalyzed the transfer of acetyl, propionyl, isobutyryl, octanoyl, and succinyl groups, all of which are known to be present in the lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, the enzyme preparation used α-(1→4)-d-glucooligosaccharides as acceptors, a result consistent with the fact that a major part of the polysaccharide component of the lipopolysaccharide has the same amylose-like structure. Both MGLP and its deacylated product, MGP, acted as acceptors of acyl groups, but MGP which had been partially acetylated by acetic anhydride was still more active. The random acetylation probably increased slightly the hydrophobic character of MGP and promoted its binding to the enzyme. In agreement with this idea was the fact that artificial d-glucooligosaccharide acceptors were completely inactive unless partially acetylated. Previous studies have established that five of the eight positions of acylation in MGLP-III are located on the four sugar units at the nonreducing end of the polysaccharide. From analysis of the product obtained in the enzymic reaction between [14C]acetyl-CoA and MGP, we now have evidence that at least two of the sites for acetylation occur in this tetrasaccharide unit. Removal of the four sugar units from MGP by the combined action of α-amylase and glucoamylase I destroyed the capacity of the polysaccharide to accept acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA. However, this partially degraded MGP retained acceptor activity for succinyl groups, which suggests that the sites for succinylation are located elsewhere in the polysaccharide, a result which is in agreement with direct chemical analysis of the lipopolysaccharide (Smith, W. L., and Ballou, C. E. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 7118–7125)."

https://openalex.org/W1527551838,"Abstract In the presence of 5 mm spermine, glycogen phosphorylase b may be activated by IMP to 70% to 90% of AMP activation. Incubation of the enzyme with trypsin results in a differential loss in IMP and AMP activation of the enzyme. The time course of the trypsin effect on the nucleotide activation is biphasic: a rapid reduction in the ratio of IMP to AMP activation from 0.7 to 0.2, due to a preferential loss in IMP activation, followed by a gradual increase in this ratio to approximately 0.7, due to a preferential loss in AMP activation. The biphasic curve suggests that at least two derivatives, phosphorylases bt and bt' are produced. In contrast to phosphorylase b, the derivatives are not stimulated by spermine. In the absence of spermine, kinetic properties of phosphorylase b and bt are similar in that they are preferentially activated by AMP. This is because AMP, but not IMP, can enhance the apparent affinity of these enzyme species toward glucose 1-phosphate, whereas both nucleotides can enhance Vmax. Phosphorylase bt' however, is activated by the two nucleotides to approximately the same extent since only Vmax is affected by either of the nucleotides. While sedimentation velocity experiments indicate that the molecular weights of the derivatives are similar to that of phosphorylase b, polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis shows clear distinctions among the three derivatives. Sodium lauryl sulfate gel electrophoresis shows that phosphorylases b and bt have similar subunit structure in that they both contain 2 subunits with molecular weights of about 90,000. The sodium lauryl sulfate gel pattern of phosphorylase bt' shows two protein bands with molecular weights 43,500 and 27,000. Gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 in the presence of sodium lauryl sulfate indicates the existence of additional polypeptides with molecular weights of a few thousands in phosphorylase bt'. These peptides constitute 20% of the total proteins. End group analyses show that the NH2 and COOH termini of phosphorylase bt are glycine and arginine, respectively. Several different amino acids at varying amounts have been found to be the NH2 termini of phosphorylase bt'. The results suggest that phosphorylase bt' contains more than one molecular species."
