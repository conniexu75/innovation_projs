https://openalex.org/W1484666375,"Nuclear transport, phosphorylation, ligand binding, and degradation rate of the recombinant androgen receptor (AR) were analyzed in transfected COS cells in the presence of various steroids and antiandrogens. Transcriptional activation was assessed in CV1 cells by cotransfection with an androgen-responsive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter vector. Hormone binding specificity of recombinant AR was essentially identical to endogenous AR. AR localized in the nucleus in the presence of methyltrienolone (R1881, a synthetic androgen), dihydrotestosterone, testosterone, hydroxyflutamide, cyproterone acetate, estradiol, progesterone, and RU486. In the absence of hormone or with the antiandrogen, flutamide, AR remained largely in the cytoplasm with a perinuclear distribution. AR was degraded rapidly (t1/2 = 1 h) except in the presence of androgen (t1/2 = 6 h) which accounted for an apparent 2-4-fold androgen-induced increase in AR phosphorylation, indicating that AR phosphorylation was not enhanced by androgen. CAT activity was stimulated by R1881, dihydrotestosterone, testosterone, cyproterone acetate, estradiol, progesterone, and RU486 in a dose-dependent manner. The antiandrogens, flutamide and hydroxyflutamide, lacked agonist activity and inhibited R1881-induced activation of CAT and androgen stabilization of AR. Steroids and antiandrogens with moderate to low affinity for AR promoted both nuclear transport and transcriptional activation but only at high hormone concentrations. Hydroxyflutamide acted as a true antiandrogen since it lacked agonist activity and was an inhibitor of androgen-induced transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W1571326346,"The overall fatty acid composition of leaf lipids in a mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana was characterized by reduced levels of polyunsaturated 18-carbon fatty acids and an increased proportion of oleate as a consequence of a single recessive nuclear mutation. Quantitative analysis of the fatty acid composition of individual lipids demonstrated that all the major phospholipids of the extrachloroplast membranes are affected by the mutation, whereas the chlorplast lipids show fatty acid compositions only slightly different from those of wild type plants. These results are consistent with the parallel operation of two pathways of lipid synthesis in plant leaf cells (the prokaryotic pathway in the chloroplast and the eukaryotic pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum) and with genetic evidence (Browse, J., Kunst, L., Anderson, S., Hugly, S., and Somerville, C.R. (1989) Plant Physiol 90, 522-529) that an independent 18:1/16:1 desaturase operates on chloroplast membrane lipids. Direct enzyme assays confirmed that the mutant plants are deficient in the activity of a microsomal oleoyl-phosphatidycholine desaturase and demonstrated that this desaturase is the major enzyme responsible for the synthesis of polyunsaturated phospholipids. Despite this deficiency in 18:1-desaturase activity, mutant plants contained relatively high levels of 18:3 in their leaf phospholipids. This finding is interpreted as additional evidence that considerable two-way exchange of lipid occurs between the chloroplast and endoplasmic reticulum and that this exchange allows the chloroplast desaturases to provide lipids containing 18:3 to the extrachloroplast compartment, thus partially alleviating the deficiency in 18:1 desaturase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1497488811,"The extracellular portion of the macrophage mannose receptor is composed of several cysteine-rich domains, including a fibronectin type II repeat and eight segments related in sequence to Ca(2+)-dependent carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) of animal lectins. Expression of portions of the receptor in vitro, in fibroblasts and in bacteria, has been used to determine which of the extracellular domains are involved in binding and endocytosis of ligand. The NH2-terminal cysteine-rich domain and the fibronectin type II repeat are not necessary for endocytosis of mannose-terminated glycoproteins. CRDs 1-3 have at most very weak affinity for carbohydrate, so the carbohydrate binding activity of the receptor resides in CRDs 4-8. CRD 4 shows the highest affinity binding and has multispecificity for a variety of monosaccharides. However, CRD 4 alone cannot account for the binding of the receptor to glycoproteins. At least 3 CRDs (4, 5, and 7) are required for high affinity binding and endocytosis of multivalent glycoconjugates. In this respect, the mannose receptor is like other carbohydrate-binding proteins, in which several CRDs, each with weak affinity for single sugars, are clustered to achieve high affinity binding to oligosaccharides. In the mannose receptor, these multiple weak interactions are achieved through several active CRDs in a single polypeptide chain rather than by oligomerization of polypeptides each containing a single CRD."
https://openalex.org/W1563425172,"The primary structure of bovine rhodopsin kinase (RK), which phosphorylates light-activated rhodopsin (Rho*), terminates with the amino acid sequence Cys558-Val-Leu-Ser561, a motif that has been shown to direct the isoprenylation and alpha-carboxyl methylation of many proteins (e.g. p21Ha-ras). Transient expression of RK in COS-7 cells revealed the presence of two immunoreactive protein species. Consistent with RK being modified by isoprenylation, interconversion of these two species was dependent upon isoprenoid biosynthesis in the cells. Moreover, a serine substitution for Cys558 resulted in a single RK species whose migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels was identical to that of RK from cells treated with mevinolin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and, thus, of isoprenoid biosynthesis. This finding indicates that isoprenylation of RK requires Cys558. The electrophoretic mobility of isoprenylated RK synthesized in COS-7 cells was identical to that of RK from bovine rod outer segments, suggesting that RK is isoprenylated in vivo. RK was determined to be modified by a farnesyl moiety and alpha-carboxyl-methylated. A time course of Rho* phosphorylation revealed that non-processed RK is approximately 4-fold less active than wild-type RK. This is the first demonstration of isoprenylation/alpha-carboxyl methylation of a protein kinase, and suggests that these modifications markedly influence enzymatic activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1845405292,"Incubation of cells of the nitrifying bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea with 14C2H2 results in the covalent attachment of 14C label to a membrane-bound polypeptide of an approximate Mr of 28,000 (Hyman, M.R., and Wood, P.M. (1985) Biochem. J. 227, 719-725). A labeling procedure using 14C2H2 generated from Ba14CO3 has been used to investigate the correlation between the extent of covalent modification of this polypeptide by 14C from 14C2H2 and the level of ammonia oxidizing activity in whole cells. The time-dependent inactivation of ammonia monooxygenase by 14C2H2 resulted in a progressive and saturable incorporation of 14C into a 27-kDa polypeptide. In contrast, the specific, time-dependent and complete inactivation of ammonia monooxygenase by light resulted in concomitant decrease in the ability of cells to incorporate 14C from 14C2H2 into this polypeptide. The 14C2H2 labeling procedure was also used to investigate the recovery of ammonia monooxygenase activity after complete inactivation of pre-existing ammonia monooxygenase by either C2H2 or light. The recovery of ammonia monooxygenase activity was closely correlated with a recovery of ability of cells to incorporate 14C label from 14C2H2 into the 27-kDa polypeptide. This recovery process was energy (NH4+)-dependent and was inhibited by chloramphenicol and rifampicin, implying that de novo protein synthesis was required. Additional polypeptides labeled with 14C from 14CO2 were also identified during recovery from C2H2 or light inactivation of ammonia monooxygenase."
https://openalex.org/W1531327859,"The effects of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-PK) phosphorylation on the degradation of the microtubule-associated protein tau by calpain were studied. Purified bovine brain tau that had been phosphorylated by cAMP-PK had a slower migration pattern on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and a more acidic, less heterogeneous pattern on two-dimensional, nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis (NEPHGE) gels compared with untreated tau. Phosphorylation of tau by cAMP-PK significantly inhibited its proteolysis by calpain compared with untreated tau. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that phosphorylation of tau by a specific kinase results in increased resistance to hydrolysis by calpain. Tau dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase migrated more rapidly on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and also showed an altered two-dimensional NEPHGE pattern. Dephosphorylation of tau had no effect on its susceptibility to calpain proteolysis, indicating that regulation of the susceptibility to calpain hydrolysis is due to the phosphorylation of a specific site(s). These results suggest a role for phosphorylation in regulating the degradation of tau. Abnormal phosphorylation could result in a protease-resistant tau population which may contribute to the formation of paired helical filaments in Alzheimer's disease."

https://openalex.org/W1557322059,"We have characterized the transport of GSH and the mechanism for impaired GSH transport in mutant Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats (EHBR) using isolated canalicular membrane-enriched vesicles (cLPM). In control animals, the transport of GSH is an electrogenic process and is trans-stimulated by preloading the vesicles with GSH and is not enhanced in the presence of ATP. GSH transport in cLPM is saturable with a single component having a Km of approximately 16 mM and a Vmax of 6.7 nmol/mg/15 s. EHBR is a Sprague-Dawley rat with hyperbilirubinemia due to impaired bile secretion of organic anions by the ATP-dependent organic anion/GSH-conjugate transporter. In cLPM from EHBR we confirmed the defective stimulation by ATP of the transport of LTC4 and GSSG. In the mutant cLPM, the characteristics and kinetics of GSH transport were the same as in the controls. 2,4-(dinitrophenyl)-glutathione (DNP-GSH), which is a substrate for the ATP-dependent canalicular organic anion carrier, in the absence of ATP, cis-inhibited the transport of GSH into cLPM vesicles; however, when the vesicles were preloaded with DNP-GSH, there was a dose-dependent trans-stimulation of GSH transport. In contrast, in the presence of ATP, DNP-GSH enhanced GSH transport in cLPM vesicles; at 0.25 mM DNP-GSH, a concentration which did not cis-inhibit GSH, addition of ATP resulted in accelerated GSH transport; at 1.0 mM DNP-GSH, cis-inhibition was completely reversed by the addition of ATP despite a negligible fall in the medium DNP-GSH. Interestingly, sulfobromophthalein-glutathione (BSP-GSH) neither cis-inhibited nor trans-stimulated GSH transport in cLPM. This contrasts with bLPM where BSP-GSH interacts with the GSH carrier. Therefore, GSH is transported into bile by a multispecific low affinity electrogenic carrier which is distinct from the multispecific high affinity ATP-driven organic anion transporter. Although both carriers have overlapping specificities, BSP-GSH and GSH are uniquely specific for only one of the carriers. The near absence of GSH in the bile of mutant rats can be best explained as a secondary defect due to cis-inhibition from retained substrates for the defective carrier and/or loss of trans-stimulation by these same substrates which normally are concentratively transported into the bile. Other possibilities such as change in GSH carrier activity upon isolation or loss of a negative protein regulator during membrane isolation, although theoretical alternatives are less easily reconciled with the defect in the ATP-driven organic anion transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1654780472,"Three ribozymes targeted against different sites of the long terminal repeat RNA (LTR RNA) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 cleaved a LTR RNA transcript 1,000 x less efficiently than corresponding short synthetic oligoribonucleotide substrates. Varying the stem lengths of the ribozyme resulted in changes of the catalytic efficiency. Almost no cleavage was observed for a ribozyme forming only 10 base pairs instead of 14 with the LTR RNA. Increasing the base pairs to 16 or elongation of the stem formed within the ribozyme revealed only small changes in kcat/Km. The influence of chemical modifications within the ribozyme on the cleavage of the LTR RNA was also examined. 2'-Fluorocytidine substitutions as well as four terminal phosphorothioate internucleotidic linkages influenced the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes only negligibly. However, substitution of uridine by 2'-fluorouridine resulted in a 5-fold decrease of kcat/Km. A ribozyme containing all these modifications revealed only a 7-fold lower catalytic efficiency but a markedly increased stability in cell culture supernatant. These results demonstrate that it is possible to increase the stability of ribozymes toward nucleases without a serious loss in catalytic efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1585476517,"To assess the role of cis-acting elements within the smooth muscle alpha-actin gene in smooth muscle cells (SMC), we transfected chicken smooth muscle alpha-actin promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene fusion plasmids into SMC derived from rat and chicken aortas. In marked contrast to effects in chicken skeletal myoblasts and fibroblasts, p122CAT (positions −122 to +19), containing two conserved CArG elements, elicited a modest increase in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter activity in chicken SMC. Addition of upstream sequences between −122 and −151 (p151CAT) increased activity in adult chicken SMC. Addition of sequence between positions −151 and −257 (p257CAT) resulted in a 7-fold increase in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity over that of p151CAT in rat SMC, but not in chicken SMC. A genomic clone encoding the rat smooth muscle alpha-actin gene was isolated, and the 5'-flanking region was partially characterized. Comparison of primary sequence between rat and chicken promoters showed a conserved E box motif at position −214 in the chicken gene and at position −213 in the rat gene. Results of these studies demonstrate that regions upstream of the conserved CArG elements exert potent regulatory effects on transcription and that SMC require different cis-acting elements than other cell types to transcriptionally regulate this gene."
https://openalex.org/W1561391742,"The catalytic subunit of rabbit skeletal muscle protein phosphatase-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli. Expression of phosphatase-1 in the pET3a vector, which is based on the use of the T7 promoter, resulted in the expression of the enzyme as an insoluble aggregate. The insoluble enzyme could be renatured by high dilutions of the urea-solubilized protein in buffers containing dithiothreitol, Mn2+, and high NaCl concentrations. However, under all conditions tested, only partial (less than 5%) renaturation was achieved. A second attempt was made using a vector with the trp-lac hybrid promoter. In this case it was possible to express the enzyme as a soluble protein at levels of 3-4% of the soluble E. coli protein. The recombinant enzyme was purified by DEAE-Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Approximately 20 mg of purified enzyme was reproducibly obtained from the cells derived from 2 liters of culture. The purified enzyme had a specific activity toward phosphorylase alpha comparable to that reported for the authentic protein and had an Mr of 37,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The recombinant enzyme displayed similar sensitivities to inhibition by inhibitor-2, okadaic acid, and microcystin-LR as for the protein isolated from rabbit muscle. At all stages of purification the recombinant phosphatase behaved as an essentially inactive enzyme that required the presence of microM Mn2+ for full expression of its activity."
https://openalex.org/W1486977846,"A synthetic tetradecapeptide having the sequence of the region of the antithrombin chain amino-terminal to the reactive bond, i.e. comprising residues P1 to P14, was shown to form a tight equimolar complex with antithrombin. A similar complex has previously been demonstrated between alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor and the analogous peptide of this inhibitor (Schulze, A. J., Baumann, U., Knof, S., Jaeger, E., Huber, R. and Laurell, C.-B. (1990) Eur. J. Biochem. 194, 51-56). The antithrombin-peptide complex had a conformation similar to that of reactive bond-cleaved antithrombin and, like the cleaved inhibitor, also had a higher conformational stability and lower heparin affinity than intact antithrombin. These properties suggest that the peptide bound to intact antithrombin at the same site that the P1 to P14 segment of the inhibitor occupies in reactive-bond-cleaved antithrombin, i.e. was incorporated as a sixth strand in the middle of the major beta-sheet, the A sheet. The extent of complex formation was reduced in the presence of heparin with high affinity for antithrombin, which is consistent with heparin binding and peptide incorporation being linked. Antithrombin in the complex with the tetradecapeptide had lost its ability to inactivate thrombin, but the reactive bond of the inhibitor was cleaved as in a normal substrate. These observations suggest a model, analogous to that proposed for alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (Engh, R.A., Wright, H.T., and Huber, R. (1990) Protein Eng. 3, 469-477) for the structure of intact antithrombin, in which the A sheet contains only five strands and the P1 to P14 segment of the chain forms part of an exposed loop of the protein. The results further support a reaction model for serpins in which partial insertion of this loop into the A sheet is required for trapping of a proteinase in a stable complex, and complete insertion is responsible for the conformational change accompanying cleavage of the reactive bond of the inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1517059827,"Mammalian DNA polymerase beta is the smallest known eukaryotic polymerase and is expressed as an active protein in Escherichia coli harboring a plasmid containing its cDNA. Since some catalytic functions of DNA polymerase beta and E. coli DNA polymerase I are similar, we wished to determine if DNA polymerase beta could substitute for DNA polymerase I in bacteria. We found that the expression of mammalian DNA polymerase beta in E. coli restored growth in a DNA polymerase I-defective bacterial mutant. Sucrose density gradient analysis revealed that DNA polymerase beta complements the replication defect in the mutant by increasing the rate of joining of Okazaki fragments. These findings demonstrate that DNA polymerase beta, believed to function in DNA repair in mammalian cells, can also function in DNA replication. Moreover, this complementation system will permit study of the in vivo function of altered species of DNA polymerase beta, an analysis currently precluded by the difficulty in isolating mutants in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1513615071,"Polyenoic very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) have been shown to be localized in unusual molecular species of sphingomyelin in the testes and spermatozoa of the ram, bull, rat, and boar and in the spermatozoa of man. The composition of polyenoic VLCFA-sphingomyelin was comparable in the testes and spermatozoa of each mammalian species; however, the sphingolipid was more concentrated in spermatozoa. The composition of testicular and spermatozoan polyenoic VLCFA-sphingomyelin differed considerably between animal types. Human spermatozoa mainly contained n-6 polyenoic VLCFA with two to four double bonds and even-carbon chain lengths up to 32. In ram and bull testes and spermatozoa, n-3 and n-6, tetra-, penta-, and hexaenoic VLCFA with even-carbon chain lengths up to 34 predominated. In rat and boar testes and spermatozoa, the polyenoic VLCFA were mainly n-6 derivatives with three to five double bonds and even- and odd-carbon chain lengths up to 34. The testes and spermatozoa of the latter two animal species contained 2-hydroxylated, in addition to non-hydroxylated, polyenoic VLCFA in sphingomyelin. This is the first time that 2-hydroxylated polyenoic VLCFA have been recognized in biological systems. Non-hydroxylated polyenoic VLCFA were initially observed in the sphingomyelin of rat testes 25 days after birth, followed by 2-hydroxylated derivatives at 30 days. The total amount of polyenoic VLCFA associated with rat testicular sphingomyelin increased dramatically from 25 to 40 days of postnatal life and then remained constant to 60 days (sexual maturity). The ratio of 2-hydroxylated to non-hydroxylated polyenoic VLCFA increased during this period. Polyenoic VLCFA-sphingomyelin seems to occur exclusively in the testes and spermatozoa of mammals, and it is postulated that this lipid plays a role in reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2122767802,"The technique of primer extension inhibition has been adapted to analyze the eukaryotic ribosome-mRNA interaction. Formation of the ribosome-mRNA complex was performed in a nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Before primer extension analysis, however, the complex is isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Both 80 S- and 40 S-mRNA complexes can be individually analyzed because of this isolation step. 80 S ribosomes and 40 S ribosomal subunits could be localized at the initiation codon by a number of independent means where all complexes were formed in a manner consistent with the current understanding of the initiation pathway for translation in eukaryotes. Complexes were also isolated with the aid of the antibiotic edeine, where the 40 S ribosomal subunit was not located at the initiation codon, but 5' to the initiation codon. This extension inhibition assay was used to complement studies regarding the ATP dependence of the 40 S-mRNA interacting initiation steps that involve the mammalian RNA-interacting initiation factors eIF-4A, -4B, and -4F. A strong requirement for ATP was observed for 40 S-mRNA complex formation. A factor-mediated stimulation of complex formation by a combination of eIF-4A, -4B, and -4F was observed, and was one which required the presence of ATP. This factor-mediated ATP-dependent stimulation of complex formation was significantly inhibited by preincubating eIF-4A with the ATP analog 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine. Finally, all complexes accumulated to a significant degree were analyzed by the primer extension assay. It was found that the 40 S ribosomal subunit was positioned at the initiation codon for all variations tested."

https://openalex.org/W1607881510,"Nuclear extracts from a nontransformed murine T lymphocyte clone contained two inducible factors that bound to a nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) site. One factor was NF-kappa B, and the other was differentiated from NF-kappa B by its mobility in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and its lack of sensitivity to protein kinase C depletion. Competition and methylation interference assays showed that the binding site for the novel factor was limited to nucleotides in the 3' half of the kappa B site. This part of the kappa B site resembled sequences in the binding site for a second inducible nuclear factor of T cells, NF-AT, as well as a conserved sequence found in several lymphokine genes, termed cytokine-1 (CK-1). Competition and methylation interference analysis showed that both NF-AT and CK-1 sequences bound a factor similar to the novel kappa B-binding factor and that binding involved a four-nucleotide sequence (TTCC) that the kappa B, CK-1, and NF-AT sites have in common. The complexes that form with each site have characteristics of NF-AT: they are induced upon T cell receptor stimulation, are sensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors and cyclosporin A, and are not sensitive to protein kinase C depletion. Thus, a factor or factors similar to NF-AT can bind to three distinct promoter sequences which occur commonly in several T cell activation genes. These results raise the possibility that related factors binding to kappa B, CK-1, and NF-AT sequences could play a role in the coordinate induction of T cell activation genes. In addition, our results suggest that kappa B and CK-1 sites represent potential cyclosporin-sensitive promoter elements by virtue of their ability to bind an NF-AT-like factor."
https://openalex.org/W1582053154,"Type III hyperlipoproteinemia typically is associated with homozygosity for apolipoprotein (apo) E2(Arg158----Cys). Dominant expression of type III hyperlipoproteinemia associated with apoE phenotype E3/3 is caused by heterozygosity for a human apoE variant, apoE3(Cys112----Arg, Arg142----Cys). However, this apoE3 variant was not separable from the normal apoE3 in these patients' plasma because the two proteins have identical amino acid composition, charge, and molecular weight. Therefore, to determine the functional characteristics of this protein, we used recombinant DNA techniques to produce this apoE variant in bacteria. We also produced a non-naturally occurring variant, apoE(Arg142----Cys), that had only the cysteine substituted at residue 142. These two apoE variants were purified from cell lysates of the transfected Escherichia coli by ultracentrifugal flotation in the presence of phospholipid, by gel filtration chromatography, and by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Both Cys142 apoE variants bound to lipoprotein receptors on human fibroblasts with only about 20% of normal binding activity. Therefore, cysteine at residue 142, not arginine at residue 112, is responsible for the decreased receptor binding activity of the variants. Cysteamine treatment and removal of the carboxyl-terminal domain had little effect on the binding activity, whereas both modulate the receptor binding activity of apoE2(Arg158----Cys). The mutation at residue 142 decreased the binding activity of apoE to both heparin and the monoclonal antibody 1D7 (this antibody inhibits receptor binding of apoE), whereas apoE2(Arg158----Cys), which is associated with recessive expression of type III hyperlipoproteinemia, binds normally to both. The Arg112, Cys142 variant predominantes 3:1 over normal apoE3 in the very low density lipoproteins of plasma from an affected subject, as assessed by differential reactivity with the antibody 1D7. The unique combination of functional properties of the Arg112, Cys142 variant provides a possible explanation for its association with dominant expression of type III hyperlipoproteinemia."
https://openalex.org/W1491878100,"Abstract The minimum structural information necessary to formulate and assess mechanistic models of integral membrane protein function is that of membrane topology. This paper characterizes the topological structure of the melibiose carrier of Escherichia coli based on constraints provided by genetic fusions to the compartment-specific reporter protein alkaline phosphatase. Twenty-eight unique chimeras exhibiting either low alkaline phosphatase activity (cytoplasmic location of the fusion joint) or high alkaline phosphatase activity (periplasmic location of the fusion joint) were characterized and used in conjunction with Goldman-Engelman-Steitz hydropathy analysis to model topological structure. The melibiose carrier is predicted to have a cytoplasmic amino terminus, two sets of six transmembrane domains separated by an unusually large cytoplasmic loop (six-loop-six arrangement), and a 45-residue cytoplasmic carboxyl tail. Remarkably, the identical six-loop-six arrangement is predicted from the hydrophobicity plots of the H(+)-coupled lactose, arabinose, xylose, and citrate cotransporters of E. coli, the glucose transporter from rat brain, the family of glucose transporters isolated from various human tissues and cell lines, and the human, mouse, and hamster multidrug resistance transporters (Henderson, P.J.F. (1990) Res. Microbiol. 141, 316-328; Maloney, P.C. (1990) Res. Microbiol. 141, 374-383). Such a broad degree of conservation (or convergence) suggests a distinct structural and/or mechanistic advantage associated with the six-loop-six motif. The nature of this advantage is as yet unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1604713777,"We have undertaken a detailed study of the mechanisms of maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and its implications for phagocytosis and IgG Fc receptor (FcR) signaling. When PMN were incubated in Ca(2+)-free medium, cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was markedly depressed and intracellular stores were depleted of calcium. [Ca2+]i in these depleted cells increased within 1 min when PMN were placed in medium containing Ca2+ and then decreased to a level close to the normal basal [Ca2+]i, replenishing the intracellular Ca2+ pools. LaCl3 prevented entry of Ca2+ into Ca(2+)-depleted PMN, but the calcium channel blockers nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil did not. Nifedipine and diltiazem but not verapamil inhibited the movement of Ca2+ from cytosol to intracellular stores. Nifedipine and diltiazem inhibited the normal increase in [Ca2+]i from aggregated IgG binding to FcR and also prevented formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenyl-alanine (fMLP)-induced [Ca2+]i rise. Verapamil had no effect on either an fMLP- or IgG-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i. Consistent with this, nifedipine and diltiazem inhibited fMLP-stimulated phagocytosis (which is dependent on an increase in [Ca2+]i) when PMN had repleted intracellular stores. In contrast, LaCl3 inhibited fMLP-stimulated ingestion only in PMN which had intracellular store depleted. None of these compounds had any effect on phorbol dibutyrate-stimulated ingestion (which is independent of a [Ca2+]i rise). In summary, these data show that Ca2+ is in rapid equilibrium between intracellular and extracellular compartments in PMN. Exchange of cytoplasmic Ca2+ with the extracellular space is inhibited by LaCl3, while exchange of Ca2+ between the cytosol and intracellular stores is inhibited by the dihydropyridine nifedipine and the benzothiazepine diltiazem. These data suggest that these drugs, which are known to regulate some plasma membrane Ca2+ channels in excitable cells, can also regulate Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in PMN and that this regulation may have significant effects on PMN function."
https://openalex.org/W1511364800,"S-laminin, a homologue of the B1 chain of laminin, is concentrated in a subset of basal laminae (BLs), including the BL at the skeletal neuromuscular junction and bears an adhesive site for motoneuron-like cells. Here, we have begun to characterize the native form of the protein. We show that several muscle- and glia-like cell lines synthesize and secrete S-laminin as well as the A, B1, and B2 subunits of the conventional laminin trimer. Experiments using subunit-specific antibodies showed that S-laminin is complexed with the A and B2 subunits of laminin but not with B1, suggesting that S-laminin replaces B1 to form a novel laminin-like trimer. Comparison of material precipitated by different antibodies provided evidence for two immunochemically distinct forms of S-laminin, both of which associate with B2 and A-like subunits. Analysis of tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that N-linked glycosylation is required neither for the selective association of S-laminin with B2 and A subunits nor for the distinction between two forms of S-laminin. Finally, a full-length S-laminin cDNA was constructed and transfected into muscle and non-muscle cells. S-laminin was detected intracellularly in both cell types, in extracellular matrix of muscle cells, and in two immunochemically distinct forms. Thus, the cDNA contains sufficient information to permit assembly, secretion, and post-translational modification of S-laminin."
https://openalex.org/W2124934324,"A preparation of porcine stage 14 intestinal heparin, which contains Ser as a predominant amino acid, was used for isolation of the carbohydrate-protein linkage region of heparin. Two glycoserines were isolated in a molar ratio of 96:4 after an exhaustive digestion with a mixture of bacterial heparinase and heparitinases. Their structures were determined by composition analysis, heparitinase digestion, co-chromatography with an authentic glycoserine on high performance liquid chromatography, and by 500-MHz one- and two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. The structure of the major one is delta GlcA beta 1-3Gal beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Xyl beta 1-O-Ser and that of the minor is delta GlcA beta 1-4GlcNAc(6-O-sulfate) alpha 1-4GlcA beta 1-3Gal beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Xyl beta 1-O-Ser. The novel 6-O-sulfated GlcNAc residue was demonstrated to occur in the vicinity of the carbohydrate-protein linkage region. The Gal residues were nonsulfated, in contrast to the sulfated Gal structures recently discovered in the carbohydrate-protein linkage region of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. The structural features are discussed in relation to biosynthetic mechanisms of the heparin glycosaminoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W1571241067,"The metabolism of cholesterol in isolated intact pig liver mitochondria has been investigated. Six major cholesterol metabolites were identified by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, the metabolic end product being 7 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoic acid. Incubations with the synthesized intermediates suggested that the major pathway from cholesterol to this acid proceeds via the sequence of 26-hydroxylation, 7 alpha-hydroxylation, further oxidation of the side chain and oxidation/isomerization in the A-ring. The observed reactions prove that in addition to a sterol 26-hydroxylase, pig liver mitochondria contain significant amounts of a 7 alpha-hydroxylase active on side chain oxygenated 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27 steroids, an oxidoreductase active in the side chain of 26-hydroxylated steroids and a 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5 steroid oxidoreductase active on 7 alpha-hydroxylated C27 steroids. Since 7 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoic acid is believed to be an important precursor of chenodeoxycholic acid, this study shows that the first reactions in the biosynthesis of bile acids can be exclusively mitochondrial and thereby bypass microsomal cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase as the rate-limiting enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1569181862,"The human progesterone receptor (hPR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor which contains two distinct transcription activation functions (TAFs). The full-length hPR and its individual TAFs were overexpressed in the baculovirus system and tested in a HeLa cell-derived in vitro transcription system. hPR stimulated transcription in a ligand-independent manner. When the two TAFs fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 were tested, only the constitutive TAF-1 was functional in vitro, strongly suggesting that the transcriptional activity of baculovirus-expressed hPR comes solely from TAF-1. The GAL-TAF-1 activator was found to self-squelch without affecting basal transcription. A partially purified fraction relieved this self-squelching and, moreover, stimulated transcriptional activation by GAL-TAF-1, while having no influence on basal transcription. These results strongly suggest that the transcriptional activity of GAL-TAF-1 requires a factor(s) distinct from the general transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1588150204,"Ras and Rap1 proteins are related GTP-dependent signal transducers which require Gly-12, the effector domain (residues 32-40), and Ala-59 for stimulation of their GTPase activities by GAP1 and GAP3, respectively. The replacement of Gly-12 by Val or Ala-59 by Thr potentiates the Ras oncogenicity and Rap1A antioncogenicity. However, the mutations in the effector domain, in particular the replacement of Thr-35 by Ala, abolish both Ras oncogenicity and Rap1A antioncogenicity, indicating that the effector domain is involved in interactions of these signal transducers with their targets as well as the GAPs. In this paper, we demonstrate that (i) replacement of Tyr-64 of the Ha-Ras protein or Phe-64 of the Rap1A protein by Glu or other non-hydrophobic amino acids reduces their intrinsic GTPase activities and abolishes their stimulation by GAP1 or GAP3, respectively, (ii) replacement of Tyr-64 by Gly and other non-hydrophobic amino acids results in complete loss of the oncogenicity of the v-Ha-Ras protein, indicating that the hydrophobic residue 64, in addition to the known effector domain, is essential for the Ras protein to interact with its target as well as GAP1. In addition we have found that Asn-26, Glu-31, and Val-45 of the v-Ha-Ras protein are required for its oncogenicity. Replacement of the Ras residues at either positions 26, 31, or 45 by the corresponding Rap1A residues abolishes the Ras oncogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W1606101287,"The three-dimensional structure of human alpha-lactalbumin for two crystal forms has been determined by x-ray analysis. One crystal (the form LT) was obtained at pH 4.2 and room temperature, while the other crystal (the form HT) was grown at pH 6.5 and 37 degrees C. The backbone structure for Lys1-Ile95 residues is almost conserved between the two structures as indicated by the root mean square difference of 0.30 A for the superposition of equivalent C alpha atoms. The calcium ion is surrounded by seven oxygen atoms of three carboxyl groups, two carbonyl groups, and two water molecules, which form a distorted pentagonal bipyramid in both structures. A large difference in polypeptide folding is found in the region of Leu96-Leu123 residues. Especially in the region of Trp104-Cys111 residues, a distorted alpha-helix is observed in the form HT while a loop structure is formed in the other crystal. The fact that the crystals of both forms appeared in the same batch at pH 6.5 and room temperature indicates that the human alpha-lactalbumin structure is highly fluctuated in solution and the folding and unfolding of the alpha-helix of Trp104-Cys111 residues are in equilibrium. Since the crystal of the form HT exclusively appeared around the physiological temperature, the structure of this form can be considered as the native structure. The partially unfolded structure in the form LT indicates that the local denaturation occurs even at room temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1603978523,"Bovine adrenal P-45011 beta catalyzes the 11 beta- and 18-hydroxylation of corticosteroids as well as aldosterone synthesis. These activities of P-45011 beta were found to be modulated by another mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 species, P-450scc. The presence together of P-45011 beta and P-450scc in liposomal membranes was found to remarkably stimulate the 11 beta-hydroxylase activity of P-45011 beta and also stimulate the cholesterol desmolase activity of P-450scc. The stimulative effect of P-450scc on 11 beta-hydroxylase activity diminished by the addition of protein-free liposomes to proteoliposomes containing P-45011 beta and P-450scc, thus showing P-450scc to interact with P-45011 beta in the same membranes. Kinetic analysis of this effect indicated the formation of an equimolar complex between P-45011 beta and P-450scc on liposomal membranes. P-45011 beta in the complex had not only stimulated activity for 11 beta- and 18-hydroxylation of 11-deoxycorticosterone but also suppressed activity for production of 18-hydroxycorticosterone and aldosterone. When the inner mitochondrial membranes of zona fasciculata-reticularis from bovine adrenal were treated with anti-P-450scc IgG, aldosterone formation was stimulated to a greater extent than that of zona glomerulosa. This indicates the aldosterone synthesizing activity of P-45011 beta in the zona fasciculata-reticularis to be suppressed by interaction with P-450scc. The zone-specific aldosterone synthesis of P-45011 beta in bovine adrenal may possibly be induced by differences in interactions with P-450scc of mitochondrial membranes in each zone."

https://openalex.org/W1494073707,"Streptomyces sp. 142, isolated from a soil sample, produced alpha-fucosidase when cultured in the presence of L-fucose. The enzyme was purified 700-fold with an overall recovery of 17% from a cell-free extract by cation exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. The apparent molecular weight of the purified enzyme was 40,000 by gel filtration chromatography. The enzyme had a pH optimum of 6.0 and was stable at pH 4.5-7.0. Substrate specificity studies with oligosaccharides labeled with 2-aminopyridine as the substrate showed that the enzyme specifically hydrolyzed terminal alpha 1-3 and alpha 1-4 fucosidic linkages in the oligosaccharides but did not hydrolyze alpha 1-2 or alpha 1-6 fucosidic linkages or a synthetic substrate, p-nitro-phenyl alpha-L-fucoside. The purified enzyme released L-fucose from a fucosylated glycoprotein, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. Thus, the substrate specificities of the Streptomyces alpha-fucosidase resembled those of alpha-fucosidases I and III isolated from almond emulsin rather than those of other microbial alpha-fucosidases."
https://openalex.org/W1510787973,"The ability of DNA to allosterically alter the conformation of the estrogen receptor's (ER) steroid binding domain was investigated. Using dissociation kinetics we observed that when DNA was bound to the DNA binding domain of the rat uterine ER the rate of estrogen dissociation from the steroid binding domain increased almost 2-fold. This change in the rate of estrogen dissociation depended on the concentration of DNA used and correlated with the thermodynamic binding affinities (Kd) of the ER for two different DNA sequences. We were unable to detect a DNA-induced change in the trypsin cleavage pattern of the amino terminal end of the ER. Using a whole cell dissociation kinetic assay with MCF-7 breast cancer cells we observed a 7-fold slower rate of estrogen dissociation from the ER within the cell than from the ER in vitro. This suggests that additional factors, other than DNA binding, may modify the steroid binding domain within the cell. We conclude that DNA can allosterically modulate the structure of the steroid binding domain of the ER, and we hypothesize that this conformational change may be necessary for the full transcriptional activity of the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1529235308,"The RecD subunit of the RecBCD enzyme from Escherichia coli contains an amino acid sequence common to many enzymes which bind ATP or GTP (Gly-X-X-Gly-X-Gly-Lys-Thr). We have changed the conserved lysine residue (amino acid number 177) in the RecD protein to glutamine to investigate the role of RecD, and ATP-binding to RecD, in the enzymatic activities of RecBCD. The mutant RecD protein assembles with the RecB and RecC subunits and the mutant enzyme, designated RecBCD-K177Q, can be purified in the same way as the wild-type RecBCD enzyme. The mutant RecD subunit in RecBCD-K177Q is photolabeled to a lesser extent by the ATP analogue 8-azido-adenosine-5'-triphosphate than is the wild-type RecD subunit in RecBCD, suggesting that the mutation has reduced the affinity of RecD for ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1567586397,"Glutamate semialdehyde aminotransferase was purified to homogeneity from pea leaves. The enzyme has an absorption spectrum with maxima at 345 and 416 nm. These chromophores were attributed to pyridoxamine phosphate and to pyridoxal phosphate bound as an aldimine respectively. Treatment of the enzyme with increasing concentrations of diaminovalerate produced a rapid fall in the 416 nm chromophore and a simultaneous increase in the 345 nm chromophore in a manner that indicated a stoichiometric reaction between 4,5-diaminovalerate and the pyridoxaldimine form of the enzyme. Treatment with 4,5-dioxovalerate produced the reverse reaction. The enzyme catalyzed the formation of aminolevulinate when dioxovalerate and diaminovalerate were present together and the maximal rate was 40% of that observed when glutamate semialdehyde itself was used as substrate. Conversion of the enzyme from its pyridoxaldimine to pyridoxamine form produced a proportional increase in activity towards glutamate semialdehyde, whereas reduction of the pyridoxaldimine form with sodium borohydride produced no change in this catalytic activity. It was concluded, therefore, that only the pyridoxamine form of the enzyme is active in catalyzing conversion of glutamate semialdehyde to aminolevulinate and that the catalytic mechanism includes enzyme-bound diaminovalerate as a central intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1482300355,"We are studying naturally occurring mutations in the gene for lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to advance our knowledge about the structure/function relationships for this enzyme. We and others have previously described 11 mutations in human LPL gene and until now none of these directly involves any of the residues in the proposed Asp156-His241-Ser132 catalytic triad. Here we report two separate probands who are deficient in LPL activity and have three different LPL gene haplotypes, suggesting three distinct mutations. Using polymerase chain reaction cloning and DNA sequencing we have identified that proband 1 is a compound heterozygote for a G----A transition at nucleotide 721, resulting in a substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at residue 156, and a T----A transversion, resulting in a substitution of serine for cysteine at residues 216. Proband 2 is homozygous for an A----G base change at nucleotide 722, leading to a substitution of glycine for aspartic acid at residue 156. The presence of these mutations in the patients and available family members was confirmed by restriction analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA. In vitro site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent expression in COS cells have confirmed that all three mutations result in catalytically defective LPL. The two naturally occurring mutations, which both alter the same aspartic acid residue in the proposed Asp156-His241-Ser132 catalytic triad of human LPL, indicate that Asp156 plays a significant role in LPL catalysis. The Cys216----Ser mutation destroys a conserved disulfide bridge that is apparently critical for maintaining LPL structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1568323030,"Abstract Despite the high degree of sequence homology between two mouse proteins AIC2A and AIC2B (91% at the amino acid level), only the AIC2A protein binds interleukin 3 (IL-3). Soluble AIC2A protein bound IL-3 with affinity similar to the membrane-bound AIC2A protein, indicating that binding of IL-3 to AIC2A was mediated by the external domain alone. The extracellular domain of the AIC2A protein has two repeats of the common motif shared by members of the cytokine receptor family. Neither one of these repeats alone bound IL-3. Hybrids of AIC2A and AIC2B revealed that the first domain of the cytokine receptor motif could be replaced with the AIC2B sequence without an affinity change, suggesting the importance of the second domain. By changing individual amino acid residues of AIC2A in the second domain which differ from those of AIC2B, we identified several amino acid residues critical for IL-3 binding. All these residues are located at the putative hinge region within the second domain."
https://openalex.org/W1632507343,"A cDNA encoding the mature E1 beta subunit of the bovine branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex was isolated from a lambda ZAP expression library. The bovine E1 beta cDNA is 1,393 base pairs in length. It encodes the entire mature E1 beta subunit consisting of 342 amino acid residues and a partial mitochondrial targeting presequence of 26 residues. The calculated molecular mass of the mature bovine E1 beta subunit is 37,776 daltons, and the calculated isoelectric point is pI 5.04. The mature bovine E1 beta subunit was expressed in Escherichia coli via the pKK233-2 vector in the presence of isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). When expression was induced by IPTG at 37 degrees C, the soluble recombinant E1 beta subunit existed as a single high molecular weight form (Mr congruent to 3.5 x 10(5)), which sedimented during sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation at 2 x 10(5) x g. However, lowering the induction temperature to 25 degrees C resulted in the occurrence of both high and low molecular weight forms of the recombinant E1 beta protein. The low molecular weight form (Mr congruent to 9.1 x 10(4)) remained soluble after sucrose gradient centrifugation and was utilized in binding studies with a series of truncated recombinant E2 proteins. The results showed that the E1 beta subunit bound to the region between Ala-115 and Lys-150 of the E2 chain, which lay within the putative E3-binding domain. In contrast, the recombinant E1 alpha subunit did not bind the E2 component. The data suggest an apparent binding order of E2-E1 beta-E1 alpha, which supports and extends the model of E2 inner core deduced previously from the data of scanning transmission electron microscopy (Hackert, M.L., Xu, W.-X., Oliver, R.M., Wall, J.S., Hainfeld, J.F., Mullinax, T.R., and Reed, L.J. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 6816-6821). The relatively inaccessible topology of E1 beta may explain the lack of antigenicity and resistance to limited proteolysis of this subunit as it exists in the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1498441846,"HL60 and EL4 cells incubated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plus staurosporin, a potent inhibitor of protein kinases, showed at least 2-fold increased levels of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activity compared with TNF-alpha alone both during rapid NF-kappa B activation from the cytosolic pool and protein synthesis-dependent NF-kappa B activation. NF-kappa B activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and interleukin-1 was inhibited by staurosporin. Staurosporin treatment hardly affected the TNF-alpha-induced increase in mRNA for the p51 subunit of NF-kappa B but interfered with any phorbol ester (PMA)-induced increase in p51 mRNA. Thus, induction of NF-kappa B and p51 mRNA by TNF-alpha was not mediated by a staurosporin-sensitive factor, but NF-kappa B activation by TNF-alpha was even reduced by action of a staurosporin-sensitive factor. Decreased levels of phosphorylation of TNF-R alpha (TNF receptor type alpha) after staurosporin-treatment correlated with increased induction of NF-kappa B by TNF-alpha. Staurosporin-treatment did not affect TNF-R levels. Although protein kinase C stimulation by PMA inhibited NF-kappa B activation by TNF-alpha, its action mechanism may be different from that of the staurosporin-sensitive factor. PMA induced disappearance of TNF-R alpha by shedding into the surrounding medium, with kinetics similar to those of its inhibition of NF-kappa B activation by TNF-alpha. Phosphorylation may not mediate receptor shedding, since PMA treatment did not detectably affect TNF-R alpha phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1667230786,"An in vitro endosome fusion assay using Dictyostelium discoideum is described. The method requires endocytosis of anti-dinitrophenol (DNP) IgG or DNP-derivitized beta-glucuronidase into two sets of cells. After homogenizing the cells, the vesicles were mixed, and fusion was measured by quantitating immune complex formation between DNP-beta-glucuronidase and anti-DNP IgG. Fusion was dependent upon ATP, temperature, pH, ionic strength, and cytosol and sensitive to detergent, dilution, trypsin, N-ethylmaleimide, and guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. Although weak bases, ionophores, hadacidin, [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid, and caffeine inhibit endocytosis in vivo, these reagents had no affect on in vitro endosome fusion. Comparison of Dictyostelium with mammalian cells showed differences in the temperature, pH, and salt requirements for fusion, possibly reflecting differences in the life-styles of various cell types. Like mammalian cells, Dictyostelium required GTP-binding protein(s) and an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor for endosome fusion. Thus, the mechanism driving endosome fusion may have been conserved throughout evolution. Electron microscopic studies confirmed in vitro endosome fusion and revealed endosomes were being engulfed by other endosomes, resulting in formation of multivesicular elements (i.e. autophagic vesicles). This system may be useful for characterizing mutations, evolution, and developmental regulation along the endocytic pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1577729601,"Cytochrome P450g is polymorphic in the male rat. This polymorphism is characterized by a 20-40-fold difference in the hepatic content of P450g in the two phenotypes. Sequencing of cDNAs from high (+g) and low (-g) phenotype rats has shown that the low phenotype is due to a defective mRNA containing nine base mutations encoding 7 amino acid substitutions. To determine the role of these structural changes in the phenotypic expression of P450g, we altered each of these residues by site-directed mutagenesis in the present studies and expressed the normal and mutant cDNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. P450+g protein was expressed at a level 4-6-fold higher than that of P450-g in yeast cells, despite the presence of identical mRNA levels. This difference in protein expression approaches the difference seen in the rat. A single amino acid change from Ser180 in P450+g to Cys in P450-g, in a highly conserved region in the P4502C subfamily, was found to be solely responsible for the phenotypic differences in expression of P450g. Protein half-life studies demonstrated that this mutation increases the degradation of P450g. This is the first example of a single amino acid substitution which alters the phenotypic expression of a P450 protein by affecting its stability."
https://openalex.org/W1525428301,"The formation of melted regions from A + T-rich sequences and left-handed Z-DNA by alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences will both be facilitated by negative supercoiling, and thus if the sequences are present within the same plasmid molecule they will compete for the free energy of supercoiling. We have studied a series of plasmids that contain either (CG)8 or (TG)12 sequences in either G + C or A + T-rich contexts, by means of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and chemical modification. We observe both B-Z and helix-coil transitions in all plasmids at elevated temperatures and low ionic strength. The plasmids fall into a number of different classes, in terms of the conformational behavior. As the superhelix density is increased, pCG8/vec ((CG)8 in G + C-rich context) undergoes an initial B-Z transition, followed by melting transitions in sequences remote from the (CG)8 sequence. The two transitions are coupled through the topology of the molecule but are otherwise independent. When the (CG)8 sequence was placed in an A + T-rich context (pCG8/col), the helix-coil transition was perturbed by the presence of the Z-DNA segment. Replacement of the (CG)8 tracts by (TG)12 sequences resulted in a further level of interaction between the transitions. Statistical mechanical modeling of the transitions suggested that at intermediate levels of negative supercoiling the Z-DNA formed by the (TG)12 sequence has a lowered probability due to the helix-coil transition in the A + T-rich sequences. These studies illustrate the complexities of competing conformational equilibria in supercoiled DNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1620775638,"The plasma clearance and the interaction of high (HMW) and low (LMW) molecular weight single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA) with rat liver cells was determined. 125I-Labeled HMW- and LMW-scu-PA were rapidly cleared from plasma with a half-life of 0.45 min and a maximal liver uptake of 55% of the injected dose. Liver uptake of scu-PA was mediated by parenchymal cells. Excess of unlabeled HMW-scu-PA reduced the liver uptake of 125I-HMW-scu-PA strongly. In vivo liver degradation of scu-PA was reduced by inhibitors of the lysosomal pathway. A high affinity binding site (Kd 45 nM, Bmax 1.7 pmol/mg cell protein) for both HMW- and LMW-scu-PA was determined on isolated parenchymal liver cells. Cross-competition binding studies showed that LMW- and HMW-scu-PA bind to the same site. Tissue-type plasminogen activator, mannose- or galactose-terminated glycoproteins did not affect the scu-PA binding to parenchymal liver cells. It is concluded that LMW- and HMW-scu-PA are taken up in the liver by a common, newly identified recognition site on parenchymal liver cells and are subsequently degraded in the lysosomes. It is suggested that this site is important for the regulation of the turnover of scu-PA."
https://openalex.org/W1523980096,"We have defined conditions whereby a functional TATA box can mediate efficient in vitro transcription by RNA polymerase III. A TATA box is absolutely required for this reaction as a single-point mutation in this sequence completely abolishes transcription. Two protein components are also required: a HeLa cell phosphocellulose fraction (fraction B) and at least one other factor that can be supplied by various crude nuclear extracts or by HeLa cell phosphocellulose fractions C and D. The order of addition is critical; fraction B must be preincubated with the template DNA for TATA box-dependent polymerase III transcription to occur. Various TATA sequences are quite similar in their ability to mediate transcription by polymerases II and III. Despite the similarity in sequence requirements, fraction B does not appear to contain any detectable transcription factor (TF) IID activity, and TATA box-mediated polymerase III transcription does not appear to require TFIID in the form contained in phosphocellulose fraction D. It was recently reported that TFIID is required TFIID in the form contained in phosphocellulose fraction D. It was recently reported that TFIID is required for polymerase III transcription of the yeast and human U6 genes (Margottin, F., Dujardin, G., Gerard, M., Egly, J.-M., Huet, J., and Sentenac, A.

The synthetase utilizes two molecules of MgATP, apparently in mechanistically discrete steps and at separate MgATP sites. Sequence analysis has revealed internal duplication within the synthetase molecule (Nyunoya, H., Broglie, K.E., Widgren, E.E., and Lusty, C.J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9346-9356) and, based on sequence similarity with other nucleotide-binding proteins, potential ATP sites have been predicted for each of the duplicated sequences. The present FSBA studies have identified four peptides within carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase I that are involved in binding MgATP. Differential effects of N-acetylglutamate, a required allosteric activator, on the interaction of FSBA with the peptides were utilized to develop the following model for two distinct MgATP sites. Peptides 631-638 and 1327-1348 (with Cys1327 and/or Cys1337 modified by FSBA) apparently form part of the binding site for the MgATP involved in bicarbonate activation. Peptides 1310-1317 and 1445-1454 (with Tyr1450 modified by FSBA) apparently form part of the binding site for the MgATP involved in phosphorylation of enzyme-bound carbamate. Each of these MgATP sites contains a peptide from one of the internal duplicated regions of the enzyme molecule, which have previously been suggested as containing MgATP sites (Nyunoya, H., Broglie, K.

https://openalex.org/W1558011774,"Abstract In J774 macrophages and murine macrophages stimulated with acetylated low density lipoprotein (acetyl-LDL), the plasma membrane free cholesterol (FC) became accessible to acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) as substrate, the result being an accumulation of cholesteryl esters (CE) (Tabas, I., Rosoff, W. J., and Boykow, G. C (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 1266-1272). As the route of delivery of FC to ACAT was not well characterized, we examined this route in the present study. In foam cells derived from rat peritoneal macrophages by preincubation with acetyl-LDL, esterification of the exogenously labeled [3H]FC was low (1.3% of total labeled cholesterol). In contrast, when cells were first labeled with exogenous [3H]FC and then chased with acetyl-LDL, the esterification was more extensive (9.2% of the total labeled cholesterol). During this experiment a significant portion of cellular [3H]FC was released into the medium (up to 33.4% of the total labeled cholesterol). In experiments using a two-compartment chamber in which cells in the lower and upper chambers were separated by filter paper yet the cells in both compartments could communicate without direct contact, [3H]FC released into the medium was biologically active and could serve as an efficient substrate for ACAT. Thus, when acetyl-LDL is not included in culture medium, FC delivery from the macrophage plasma membrane to ACAT is not enhanced, whereas in the presence of acetyl-LDL, plasma membrane FC released and bound to acetyl-LDL may re-enter the cells, possibly through the scavenger receptor. This would provide a significant route for CE synthesis in macrophages."

Woodward's reagent K can be used as a cross-linking reagent, since amino groups can apparently react with the enol ester. Treatment of cytochrome P-450scc with H2O2 was used to obtain the apoprotein. Functional reconstitution of the hemin derivative with apocytochrome P-450scc was achieved. The reconstituted hemeprotein was purified, and the resulting preparation contained no P-420 form and had the same cholesterol-hydroxylating activity as a control preparation. 30% of the reconstituted hemin was covalently bound to protein.

https://openalex.org/W1544075262,"The signal peptide of secretory proteins requires a basic amino terminus followed by a stretch of hydrophobic residues to effect efficient translocation of precursor proteins. Replacement of the positively charged amino-terminal residues of prolipoprotein by acidic amino acids decreased the rate of precursor translocation (Inouye, S., Soberon, X., Franceschini, T., Nakamura, K., Itakura, K., and Inouye, M. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 3438-3441; Vlasuk, G. P., Inouye, S., Ito, H., Itakura, K., and Inouye, M. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 7141-7148). We demonstrate here that an arginine residue, but not an aspartate, when localized at position 9 of the hydrophobic region of the lipoprotein signal peptide, is able to suppress intramolecularly the processing defect caused by an acidic amino terminus. Furthermore, when present at position 14 of the signal peptide, this positive residue, but not aspartate, was able to support efficient translocation of unmodified prolipoprotein. This demonstrates that a positive residue can restore the function of a severely defective signal peptide and need not be localized at the amino terminus to do so. Both aspartate and arginine substitution at position 14 of the lipoprotein signal peptide stimulated prolipoprotein synthesis. This effect was position-specific, did not require precursor translocation, and was dominant to the inhibition of synthesis caused by an acidic amino terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1567429542,"Using oligonucleotide affinity chromatography with DNase I footprinting as an assay we have looked for proteins that interact with sequence elements within the yeast origin of replication, autonomously replicating sequence 1 (ARS1). In this work we describe a protein that binds with high affinity to DNA but displays only moderate sequence specificity. It is eluted at 0.7 M salt from an ARS1 oligonucleotide column. Footprinting analysis on ARS1 at a high protein concentration revealed at least three sites of protection flanking element A and its repeats. Element A itself is rendered hypersensitive to DNase I digestion upon protein binding. This pattern is also observed for the H4 and HMR-E ARSs, suggesting that the protein alters the DNA conformation at element A and its repeats. The affinity-purified fraction is also capable of supercoiling a relaxed, covalently closed plasmid in the presence of topoisomerase. Highly purified preparations of the protein are enriched in an 18-kDa polypeptide which can be renatured from a denaturing gel and shown to bind ARS1 DNA. We have designated this protein DBF-A, DNA-binding factor A."
