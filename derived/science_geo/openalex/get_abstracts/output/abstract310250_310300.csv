https://openalex.org/W2069764856,"The molecular sieve MCM-22 contains structural features previously unobserved in this class of materials. Its framework topology, derived from high-resolution electron micrographs and refined with synchrotron x-ray diffraction powder data, contains two independent pore systems, both of which are accessed through rings composed of ten tetrahedral (T) atoms (such as Si, Al, and B). One of these pore systems is defined by two-dimensional, sinusoidal channels. The other consists of large supercages whose inner free diameter, 7.1 angstroms, is defined by 12 T—O species (12-rings) and whose inner height is 18.2 angstroms. These coexisting pore systems may provide opportunities for a wide variety of catalytic applications in the petrochemical and refining industries. Another structural feature is an unusual -T-O-T- chain that passes through the center of a modified dodecasil-1H [435663] cage."
https://openalex.org/W2011793738,"An x-ray surface forces apparatus for simultaneously measuring forces and structures of confined complex fluids under static and flow conditions is described. This apparatus, combined with an intense synchrotron x-ray source, allows investigation of molecular orientations within a thin liquid crystal film confined between two shearing mica surfaces 3900 angstroms apart. The layer-forming smectic liquid crystal 8CB (4-cyano-4'-octylbiphenyl) adopted a series of distinct planar layer orientations, including the bulk flow-forbidden b orientation."
https://openalex.org/W2055597101,The spatial distribution of small translucent droplets inside a 50-millimeter-thick Intralipid solution was imaged with a picosecond time and spatial-gated Kerr-Fourier imaging system at a signal level of about 10(-10) of the incident illumination intensity.
https://openalex.org/W2076025539,"Recent high-pressure experiments and thermodynamic calculations have shown that the Clapeyron slope of the spinel-perovskite phase transition at a depth of 660 kilometers in the Earth's mantle changes from negative to positive at temperatures above 1700° to 2000°C. In numerical experiments that account for this phase behavior, cold downwelling flows were impeded at the phase boundary, but hot plumes ascended to the upper mantle with ease. The resultant mantle convection was partially layered and strongly time-dependent. Mantle layering was weaker when the mantle was hotter and when the Rayleigh number was larger."

https://openalex.org/W2025316134,"This article describes experiments on proton structure being performed at the Hadron-Electron Ring Accelerator (HERA) at DESY. Experiments so far have revealed the interior of the proton to contain a sea of gluons and virtual quarks, in addition to the three valence quarks. An unidentified particle in the interior of the proton has also been found."
