https://openalex.org/W3134114781,"The proliferation of fake news on social media is now a matter of considerable public and governmental concern. In 2016, the UK EU referendum and the US Presidential election were both marked by social media misinformation campaigns, which have subsequently reduced trust in democratic processes. More recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the acceptance of fake news has been shown to pose a threat to public health. Research on how to combat the false acceptance of fake news is still in its infancy. However, recent studies have started to focus on the psychological factors which might make some individuals less likely to fall for fake news. Here, we adopt that approach to assess whether individuals who show high levels of 'emotional intelligence' (EQ) are less likely to fall for fake news items. That is, are individuals who are better able to disregard the emotionally charged content of such items, better equipped to assess the veracity of the information. Using a sample of UK participants, an established measure of EQ and a novel fake news detection task, we report a significant positive relationship between individual differences in emotional intelligence and fake news detection ability. We also report a similar effect for higher levels of educational attainment, and we report some exploratory qualitative fake news judgement data. Our findings are discussed in terms of their applicability to practical short term (i.e. current Facebook user data) and medium term (i.e. emotional intelligence training) interventions which could enhance fake news detection."

The varying trajectories of the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries afford the opportunity to assess the unique influence of 'macro-level' environmental factors and 'micro-level' psychological variables on both fear and perceived health. Here, we investigate predictors of fear and perceived health using machine learning as lockdown restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were introduced in Austria, Spain, Poland and Czech Republic. Over a seven-week period, 533 participants completed weekly self-report surveys which measured the target variables subjective fear of the virus and perceived health, in addition to potential predictive variables related to psychological factors, social factors, perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD), and economic circumstances. Viral spread, mortality and governmental responses were further included in the analysis as potential environmental predictors. Results revealed that our models could accurately predict fear of the virus (accounting for approximately 23% of the variance) using predictive factors such as worrying about shortages in food supplies and perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD), where interestingly, environmental factors such as spread of the virus and governmental restrictions did not contribute to this prediction. Furthermore, our results revealed that perceived health could be predicted using PVD, physical exercise, attachment anxiety and age as input features, albeit with smaller effect sizes. Taken together, our results emphasize the importance of 'micro-level' psychological factors, as opposed to 'macro-level' environmental factors, when predicting fear and perceived health, and offer a starting point for more extensive research on the influences of pathogen threat and governmental restrictions on the psychology of fear and health."
https://openalex.org/W3134596643,"The first case of the novel coronavirus in Brazil was notified on February 26, 2020. After 21 days, the first case was reported in the second largest State of the Brazilian Amazon. The State of Pará presented difficulties in combating the pandemic, ranging from underreporting and a low number of tests to a large territorial distance between cities with installed hospital capacity. Due to these factors, mathematical data-driven short-term forecasting models can be a promising initiative to assist government officials in more agile and reliable actions. This study presents an approach based on artificial neural networks for the daily and cumulative forecasts of cases and deaths caused by COVID-19, and the forecast of demand for hospital beds. Six scenarios with different periods were used to identify the quality of the generated forecasting and the period in which they start to deteriorate. Results indicated that the computational model adapted capably to the training period and was able to make consistent short-term forecasts, especially for the cumulative variables and for demand hospital beds."

In this study, we estimated aflatoxin-induced liver cancer risk in 2016 for Tanzania and used the information to estimate the health burden due to the aflatoxin exposure in the country. The burden of aflatoxin-induced liver cancer was assessed based on available aflatoxin biomarker data from a previous epidemiology study, hepatitis B virus infection prevalence and population size of Tanzania in 2016. The health burden due to aflatoxin-induced liver cancer was estimated using disability adjusted life years (DALYs). The aflatoxin exposures ranged from 15.0–10,926.0 ng/kg bw/day (median, 105.5 ng/kg bw/day). We estimated that in 2016 there were about 1,480 (2.95 per 100,000 persons) new cases of aflatoxin-induced liver cancer in Tanzania and assumed all of them would die within a year. These morbidity and mortality rates led to a total loss of about 56,247.63 DALYs. These results show, quantitatively, the cases of liver cancer and related deaths that could be avoided, and the healthy life years that could be saved, annually, by strengthening measures to control aflatoxin contamination in Tanzania."
https://openalex.org/W3133735668,"Bacterial spot (BS), incited by Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria ( Xcv ), is one of the most serious diseases of pepper. For a comparative analysis of defense responses to Xcv infection, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of a susceptible cultivar, ECW, and a resistant cultivar, VI037601, using the HiSeq TM 2500 sequencing platform. Approximately 120.23 G clean bases were generated from 18 libraries. From the libraries generated, a total of 38,269 expressed genes containing 11,714 novel genes and 11,232 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the most noticeable pathways were plant-pathogen interaction, MAPK signaling pathway—plant, plant hormone signal transduction and secondary metabolisms. 1,599 potentially defense-related genes linked to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), calcium signaling, and transcription factors may regulate pepper resistance to Xcv . Moreover, after Xcv inoculation, 364 DEGs differentially expressed only in VI037601 and 852 genes in both ECW and VI037601. Many of those genes were classified as NBS-LRR genes, oxidoreductase gene, WRKY and NAC transcription factors, and they were mainly involved in metabolic process, response to stimulus and biological regulation pathways. Quantitative RT-PCR of sixteen selected DEGs further validated the RNA-seq differential gene expression analysis. Our results will provide a valuable resource for understanding the molecular mechanisms of pepper resistance to Xcv infection and improving pepper resistance cultivars against Xcv ."
https://openalex.org/W3134988338,"An estimated 10 million people developed tuberculosis (TB) disease in 2019 which underscores the need for a vaccine that prevents disease and reduces transmission. The aim of our current studies is to characterize and test a prophylactic tuberculosis vaccine comprised of ID93, a polyprotein fusion antigen, and a liposomal formulation [including a synthetic TLR4 agonist (glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant, GLA) and QS-21] in a preclinical mouse model of TB disease. Comparisons of the ID93+GLA-LSQ vaccines are also made to the highly characterized ID93+GLA-SE oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, which are also included these studies. The recent success of vaccine candidate M72 combined with adjuvant AS01E (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) in reducing progression to active disease is promising and has renewed excitement for experimental vaccines currently in the TB vaccine pipeline. The AS01E adjuvant contains monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and QS-21 (a saponin) in a liposomal formulation. While AS01E has demonstrated potent adjuvant activity as a component of both approved and experimental vaccines, developing alternatives to this adjuvant system will become important to fill the high demand envisioned for future vaccine needs. Furthermore, replacement sources of potent adjuvants will help to supply the demand of a TB vaccine [almost one-quarter of the world's population are estimated to have latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) according to the WHO 2019 global TB report], addressing (a) cost of goods, (b) supply of goods, and (c) improved efficacy of subunit vaccines against Mtb. We show that both ID93+GLA-SE (containing an emulsion adjuvant) and ID93+GLA-LSQ (containing a liposomal adjuvant) induce ID93-specific TH1 cellular immunity including CD4+CD44+ T cells expressing IFNγ, TNF, and IL-2 (using flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine staining) and vaccine-specific IgG2 antibody responses (using an ELISA). In addition, both ID93+GLA-SE and ID93+GLA-LSQ effectively decrease the bacterial load within the lungs of mice infected with Mtb. Formulations based on this liposomal adjuvant formulation may provide an alternative to AS01 adjuvant systems."
https://openalex.org/W3133936376,"Caste plays a significant role in Indian society and it influences women to health care access in the community. The implementation of the maternal health benefits scheme in India is biased due to caste identity. In this context, the paper investigates access to Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) among social groups to establish that caste still plays a pivotal role in Indian society. Also, this paper aims to quantify the discrimination against Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes (SCs/STs) in accessing JSY.This paper uses a national-level data set of both NFHS-3 (2005-06) and NFHS-4 (2015-16). Both descriptive statistics and the Fairlie decomposition econometric model have been used to measure the explained and unexplained differences in access to JSY between SCs/STs and non-SCs/STs groups.Overall, the total coverage of JSY in India is still, 36.4%. Further, it is found that 72% of access to JSY is explained by endowment variables. The remaining unexplained percentage (28%) indicates that there is caste discrimination (inequity associated social-discrimination) against SCs/STs in access to JSY. The highest difference (54%) between SCs/STs and non-SCs/STs in access to JSY comes from the wealth quintile, with the positive sign indicating that the gap between the two social groups is widening.It is necessary for the government to implement a better way to counter the caste-based discrimination in access to maternal health benefits scheme. In this regard, ASHA and Anganwadi workers must be trained to reduce the influence of dominant caste groups as well as they must be recruited from the same community to identify the right beneficiaries of JSY and in order to reduce inequity associated with social-discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W3135293112,"Background The coronavirus infectious disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in significant morbidities, severe acute respiratory failures and subsequently emergency departments’ (EDs) overcrowding in a context of insufficient laboratory testing capacities. The development of decision support tools for real-time clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 is of prime importance to assist patients’ triage and allocate resources for patients at risk. Methods and principal findings From March 2 to June 15, 2020, clinical patterns of COVID-19 suspected patients at admission to the EDs of Liège University Hospital, consisting in the recording of eleven symptoms (i.e. dyspnoea, chest pain, rhinorrhoea, sore throat, dry cough, wet cough, diarrhoea, headache, myalgia, fever and anosmia) plus age and gender, were investigated during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. Indeed, 573 SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed by qRT-PCR before mid-June 2020, and 1579 suspected cases that were subsequently determined to be qRT-PCR negative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled in this study. Using multivariate binary logistic regression, two most relevant symptoms of COVID-19 were identified in addition of the age of the patient, i.e. fever (odds ratio [OR] = 3.66; 95% CI: 2.97–4.50), dry cough (OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.39–2.12), and patients older than 56.5 y (OR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.67–2.58). Two additional symptoms (chest pain and sore throat) appeared significantly less associated to the confirmed COVID-19 cases with the same OR = 0.73 (95% CI: 0.56–0.94). An overall pondered (by OR) score (OPS) was calculated using all significant predictors. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated and the area under the ROC curve was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.68–0.73) rendering the use of the OPS to discriminate COVID-19 confirmed and unconfirmed patients. The main predictors were confirmed using both sensitivity analysis and classification tree analysis. Interestingly, a significant negative correlation was observed between the OPS and the cycle threshold (Ct values) of the qRT-PCR. Conclusion and main significance The proposed approach allows for the use of an interactive and adaptive clinical decision support tool. Using the clinical algorithm developed, a web-based user-interface was created to help nurses and clinicians from EDs with the triage of patients during the second COVID-19 wave."
https://openalex.org/W3135643341,"A recent COSMIN review found that the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment–Achilles tendinopathy questionnaire (VISA-A) has flawed construct validity. The objective of the current study was to assess specifically the process of how VISA-A was constructed and validated, and whether the Danish version of VISA-A is a valid patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for measuring the perceived impact of Achilles tendinopathy. The original item generation strategy for content validity and the process for confirming the scaling properties (construct validity) were examined. In addition, construct validity was evaluated directly using several psychometric methods (Rasch analysis, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and multivariable linear regression) in a cohort of 318 persons with Achilles tendinopathy with symptom duration groups ranging from less than 3 months to more than 1 year of chronicity, and a group of 120 healthy persons. We found that the item generation and item reduction in the original construction of VISA-A was based on literature review and clinician consensus with little or no patient involvement. We determined that 1) VISA-A consists of ambiguous conceptual item themes and thus lacks content validity, 2) there was no thorough investigation of the psychometric properties of the original version of VISA-A, which thus lacks construct validity, and 3) rigorous direct assessment of the psychometric properties of the Danish VISA-A revealed inadequate psychometric properties. In agreement with the COSMIN study, we conclude that when used as a single score, VISA-A is not an adequate scale for measuring self-reported impact of Achilles tendinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W3135680109,"Automatically operating particle detection devices generate valuable data, but their use in routine aerobiology needs to be harmonized. The growing network of researchers using automatic pollen detectors has the challenge to develop new data processing systems, best suited for identification of pollen or spore from bioaerosol data obtained near-real-time. It is challenging to recognise all the particles in the atmospheric bioaerosol due to their diversity. In this study, we aimed to find the natural groupings of pollen data by using cluster analysis, with the intent to use these groupings for further interpretation of real-time bioaerosol measurements. The scattering and fluorescence data belonging to 29 types of pollen and spores were first acquired in the laboratory using Rapid-E automatic particle detector. Neural networks were used for primary data processing, and the resulting feature vectors were clustered for scattering and fluorescence modality. Scattering clusters results showed that pollen of the same plant taxa associates with the different clusters corresponding to particle shape and size properties. According to fluorescence clusters, pollen grouping highlighted the possibility to differentiate Dactylis and Secale genera in the Poaceae family. Fluorescent clusters played a more important role than scattering for separating unidentified fluorescent particles from tested pollen. The proposed clustering method aids in reducing the number of false-positive errors."
https://openalex.org/W3134898391,"Background Psychological factors link the co-occurrence of tinnitus-related distress and pain perceptions in patients with chronic tinnitus. Objective This study examines, if treatment-related changes in these factors ameliorate both tinnitus-related distress and pain perceptions in a sample of patients with chronic tinnitus. Methods N = 1238 patients with chronic tinnitus provided pre- and post-treatment ratings of tinnitus-related distress and affective or sensory pain perceptions alongside measures of depressive symptoms and perceived stress. Treatment comprised an intensive tinnitus-specific multimodal treatment program. Using serial indirect-effects analyses, we examined association patterns between baseline values and change rates of those variables that were found to respond to treatment. Results Small effect sizes emerged for changes in tinnitus-related distress, affective (but not sensory) pain perceptions, depressive symptoms, emotional tension and worry. At pre- or post-treatment respectively, baseline values and change rates intercorrelated. Across timepoints, (1) baseline tinnitus-related distress and affective pain perceptions were positively associated with improvements in tinnitus-related distress, affective pain perceptions and depressive symptoms. (2) Baseline depressive symptoms or emotional tension mediated positive associations between baseline tinnitus-related distress and improvement in affective pain perceptions. (3) Change in depressive symptoms mediated the effect of baseline tinnitus-related distress on change in affective pain perceptions–partly through associated change in emotional tension or worry. Mood-independent aspects of emotional tension were negatively associated with improvement in affective pain perceptions. Conclusions Depressive symptoms, emotional tension and worry emerge as key predictors of treatment response and transdiagnostic treatment targets for alleviating tinnitus-related distress and functionally associated affective pain perceptions."
https://openalex.org/W3133537369,"Multifunctional and low-cost electrode materials are desirable for the next-generation sensors and energy storage applications. This paper reports the use of pencil graphite as an electrode for dual applications that include the detection of free residual chlorine using electro-oxidation process and as an electrochemical energy storage cathode. The pencil graphite is transferred to cellulose paper by drawing ten times and applied for the detection of free residual chlorine, which shows a sensitivity of 27 μA mM-1 cm-2 with a limit of detection of 88.9 μM and linearity up to 7 mM. The sample matrix effect study for the commonly interfering ions such as NO3-, SO42-, CO32-, Cl-, HCO3- shows minimal impact on free residual chlorine detection. Pencil graphite then used after cyclic voltammogram treatment as a cathode in the aqueous Zn/Al-ion battery, showing an average discharge potential plateau of ~1.1 V, with a specific cathode capacity of ~54.1 mAh g-1 at a current of 55 mA g-1. It maintains ~95.8% of its initial efficiency after 100 cycles. Results obtained from the density functional theory calculation is consistent with the electro-oxidation process involved in the detection of free residual chlorine, as well as intercalation and de-intercalation behavior of Al3+ into the graphite layers of Zn/Al-ion battery. Therefore, pencil graphite due to its excellent electro-oxidation and conducting properties, can be successfully implemented as low cost, disposable and green material for both sensor and energy-storage applications."
https://openalex.org/W3133840184,"What makes a literate person? What leads to literacy gains and losses within and between individuals and countries? This paper provides new evidence that helps answer these questions. The present comparative analysis of literacy is based on large representative samples from the Survey of Adult Skills conducted in 33 countries, with 25–65 year old participants. We provide, for the first time, estimates of relative importance for a comprehensive set of experiential factors, motivations, incentives, parental influence, demands of workplace, and other predictors of influence. We sketch a configuration of factors that predicts an “ideal” reader, i.e., the optimal literacy performance. Moreover, we discover a pivotal role of the age effect in predicting variability between countries. Countries with the highest literacy scores are the ones where literacy decreases with age the most strongly. We discuss this finding against current accounts of aging effects, cohort effects and others. Finally, we provide methodological recommendations for experimental studies of aging in cognitive tasks like reading."
https://openalex.org/W3135030189,"Background Continuity of care is a well-recognized principle of the primary care discipline owing to its medical, interpersonal, and cost-saving benefits. Relationship continuity or the ongoing therapeutic relationship between a patient and their physician is a particularly desirable goal, but its role in preventing the accumulation of chronic conditions diagnoses in individuals is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of continuity of care with physicians on the rate of incident multimorbidity diagnoses in patients with existing conditions. Methods This was a population-based, retrospective cohort study from 2001 to 2015 that focused on patients aged 18 to 105 years with at least one chronic condition (n = 166,665). Our primary exposure was relationship continuity of care with general practitioners and specialists measured using the Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Index (COCI). COCI was specified as a time-dependent exposure prior to the observation period. Our outcomes of interest were the time to diagnosis of a second, third, and fourth chronic condition estimated using cause-specific hazard regressions accounting for death as a competing risk. Findings We observed that patients with a single chronic condition and high continuity of care (&gt;0.50) were diagnosed with a second chronic condition or multimorbidity at an 8% lower rate compared to individuals with low continuity (cause-specific hazard ratio (HR) 0.92 (95% Confidence Interval 0.90–0.93; p &lt;0.0001) after adjusting for age, sex, income, place of residence, primary care enrolment, and the annual number of physician visits. Continuity remained protective as the degree of multimorbidity increased. Among patients with two conditions, the risk of diagnosis of a third chronic condition was also 8% lower for individuals with high continuity (HR 0.92; CI 0.90–0.94; p &lt;0.0001). Patients with three conditions and high continuity had a 9% lower risk of diagnosis with a fourth condition (HR 0.91; CI 0.89–0.93; p &lt;0.0001). Conclusions Continuity of care is a potentially modifiable health system factor that reduces the rate at which diagnoses of chronic conditions are made over time in patients with multimorbidity. Additional research is needed to explain the underlying mechanisms through which continuity is related to a protective effect and the clinical sequalae."
https://openalex.org/W3135565908,"This study examines farmers’ intentions towards pro-environmental behavior in a famous tourist village in China called Guanshan, whose ecological environment is polluted. By adopting the empirically validated norm activation model (NAM) of Schwartz and merging it with Vroom’s expectancy theory, the current research aims to develop a refined framework for understanding the formation of and predicting changes in pro-environmental intention. Field surveys were conducted in Guanshan, which resulted in sample data consisting of 275 valid responses collected by the research team. We develop a refined model, including six latent variables and 24 observational items. The structural equation modeling results show that the final model enjoys a better predictive accuracy of pro-environmental intention than does the original NAM. The study also discovers that the motivational force of expectancy theory significantly influences pro-environmental intention, whose motivational force comes from the impact of valence and expectancy. The pro-environmental intentions of farmers are mainly affected by the environmental personal norm and by a certain degree of personal expectancy. The improvement of farmers’ pro-environmental intention needs be promoted in two approaches: the cultivation of personal environmental protection norms and the guidance of producing a desired expectation for pro-environmental intention."
https://openalex.org/W3134965427,"Novel strategies to re-engage and retain people living with HIV (PLWH) who are out of care are greatly needed. While mobile clinics have been used effectively for HIV testing and linkage, evidence guiding their use in providing HIV care domestically has been limited. To guide the development of a mobile HIV clinic (MHC) model as a strategy to re-engage and retain PLWH who are out of care, we aimed to explore stakeholder perceptions of barriers and facilitators to MHC implementation and use. From June 2019-July 2020, we conducted 41 in-depth interviews with HIV clinic providers, administrators, staff, legal authorities, and community advisory board members, PLWH, AIDS service organizations and city officials in Atlanta, Georgia, and domestic and international mobile health clinics to explore barriers and facilitators to use of MHCs. Interviews were transcribed, coded and thematically analysed. Barriers raised include potential for: breach of confidentiality with resulting heightened stigmatization, fractured continuity of care, safety concerns, staffing challenges, and low community acceptance of MHC presence in their locality. Participants provided suggestions regarding appropriate exterior design, location, timing, and co-delivery of non-HIV services that could facilitate MHC acceptance and address the concerns. In identifying key barriers and facilitators to MHC use, this study informs design and implementation of an MHC as a novel strategy for re-engaging and retaining PLWH who are out of care."
https://openalex.org/W3135016227,"In canine leishmaniosis caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum , little is known about how co-infections with or co-seropositivities for other pathogens can influence aggravation of this disease. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the frequency of co-infections with or co-seropositivities for certain pathogens in dogs seropositive for L . infantum and their relationship with clinical signs, histological changes and L . infantum load. Sixty-six L . infantum -seropositive dogs were submitted to clinical examination, collection of blood and bone marrow, culling, and necropsy. Antibodies against Anaplasma spp., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Ehrlichia spp. and Toxoplasma gondii and Dirofilaria immitis antigens were investigated in serum. Samples from different tissues were submitted to histopathology and immunohistochemistry for the detection of Leishmania spp. and T . gondii . Quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess the L . infantum load in spleen samples. For detection of Coxiella burnetii , conventional PCR and nested PCR were performed using bone marrow samples. All 66 dogs tested positive for L . infantum by qPCR and/or culture. Fifty dogs (76%) were co-seropositive for at least one pathogen: T . gondii (59%), Ehrlichia spp., (41%), and Anaplasma spp. (18%). Clinical signs were observed in 15 (94%) dogs monoinfected with L . infantum and in 45 (90%) dogs co-seropositive for certain pathogens. The L . infantum load in spleen and skin did not differ significantly between monoinfected and co-seropositive dogs. The number of inflammatory cells was higher in the spleen, lung and mammary gland of co-seropositive dogs and in the mitral valve of monoinfected dogs. These results suggest that dogs infected with L . infantum and co-seropositive for certain pathogens are common in the region studied. However, co-seropositivities for certain pathogens did not aggravate clinical signs or L . infantum load, although they were associated with a more intense inflammatory reaction in some organs."
https://openalex.org/W3133785793,"Cytoplasmic dynein (dynein 1), a major retrograde motor of eukaryotic cells, is a 1.4 MDa protein complex consisting of a pair of heavy chains (DYNC1H1) and a set of heterodimeric noncatalytic accessory components termed intermediate, light intermediate and light chains. DYNC1H1 (4644 amino acids) is the dynein backbone encoded by a gene consisting of 77 exons. We generated a floxed Dync1h1 allele that excises exons 24 and 25 and truncates DYNC1H1 during Six3Cre-induced homologous recombination. Truncation results in loss of the motor and microtubule-binding domain. Dync1h1 F/F ;Six3Cre photoreceptors degenerated rapidly within two postnatal weeks. In the postnatal day 6 (P6) Dync1h1 F/F ;Six3Cre central retina, outer and inner nuclear layers were severely disorganized and lacked a recognizable outer plexiform layer (OPL). Although the gene was effectively silenced by P6, DYNC1H1 remnants persisted and aggregated together with rhodopsin, PDE6 and centrin-2-positive centrosomes in the outer nuclear layer. As photoreceptor degeneration is delayed in the Dync1h1 F/F ;Six3Cre retina periphery, retinal lamination and outer segment elongation are in part preserved. DYNC1H1 strongly persisted in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) beyond P16 suggesting lack of clearance of the DYNC1H1 polypeptide. This persistence of DYNC1H1 allows horizontal, rod bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cells to survive past P12. The results show that cytoplasmic dynein is essential for retina lamination, nuclear positioning, vesicular trafficking of photoreceptor membrane proteins and inner/outer segment elaboration."

https://openalex.org/W3134399677,"Understanding genetic diversity and structure in a rare species is critical for prioritizing both in situ and ex situ conservation efforts. One such rare species is Physaria filiformis (Brassicaceae), a threatened, winter annual plant species. The species has a naturally fragmented distribution, occupying three different soil types spread across four disjunct geographical locations in Missouri and Arkansas. The goals of this study were to understand: (1) whether factors associated with fragmentation and small population size (i.e., inbreeding, genetic drift or genetic bottlenecks) have reduced levels of genetic diversity, (2) how genetic variation is structured and which factors have influenced genetic structure, and (3) how much extant genetic variation of P . filiformis is currently publicly protected and the implications for the development of conservation strategies to protect its genetic diversity. Using 16 microsatellite markers, we genotyped individuals from 20 populations of P . filiformis from across its geographical range and one population of Physaria gracilis for comparison and analyzed genetic diversity and structure. Populations of P . filiformis showed comparable levels of genetic diversity to its congener, except a single population in northwest Arkansas showed evidence of a genetic bottleneck and two populations in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas showed lower genetic variation, consistent with genetic drift. Populations showed isolation by distance, indicating that migration is geographically limited, and analyses of genetic structure grouped individuals into seven geographically structured genetic clusters, with geographic location/spatial separation showing a strong influence on genetic structure. At least one population is protected for all genetic clusters except one in north-central Arkansas, which should therefore be prioritized for protection. Populations in the Ouachita Mountains were genetically divergent from the rest of P . filiformis ; future morphological analyses are needed to identify whether it merits recognition as a new, extremely rare species."
https://openalex.org/W3134825225,"Objectives Despite the increasing knowledge about placebo effects and their beneficial impact on treatment outcomes, strategies that explicitly employ these mechanisms remain scarce. To benefit from placebo effects, it is important to gain better understanding in how individuals want to be informed about placebo effects (for example about the underlying mechanisms that steer placebo effects). The main aim of this study was to investigate placebo information strategies in a general population sample by assessing current placebo knowledge, preferences for different placebo explanations (built around well-known mechanisms involved in placebo effects), and attitudes and acceptability towards the use of placebo effects in treatment. Design Online survey. Setting Leiden, The Netherlands. Participants 444 participants (377 completers), aged 16–78 years. Main outcome measures Current placebo knowledge, placebo explanation preferences, and placebo attitudes and acceptability. Results Participants scored high on current placebo knowledge (correct answers: M = 81.15%, SD = 12.75). Comparisons of 8 different placebo explanations revealed that participants preferred explanations based on brain mechanisms and positive expectations more than all other explanations ( F (7, 368) = 3.618, p = .001). Furthermore, attitudes and acceptability for placebos in treatment varied for the type of the condition (i.e. more acceptant for psychological complaints) and participants indicated that physicians do not always have to be honest while making use of placebo effects for therapeutic benefit. Conclusion Our results brought forth new evidence in placebo information strategies, and indicated that explanations based on brain mechanisms and positive expectations were most preferred. These results can be insightful to construct placebo information strategies for both clinical context and research practices."

The outcomes evaluated: feed intake, performance, body development, blood cells and metabolites, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), rumen fermentation, fecal scores, and respiratory scores. All outcomes were evaluated during pre-weaning (4–60 d of age), and carry-over effects during post-weaning (61–90 d of age) periods. The experimental units utilized were 29 newborn Holstein × Gyr crossbred dairy heifers, with genetic composition of 5/8 or more Holstein and 3/8 or less Gyr and body weight (BW) at birth of 32.2 ± 5.2 kg. Experimental units were assigned to either a control (CON, n = 15) or a blend of essential oil supplementation (BEO, n = 14) treatment, maintaining a balance of genetic composition. The BEO was supplemented in the MR with 1 g/d/calf of a blend of essential oils (Apex Calf, Adisseo, China) composed by plant extracts derived from anise, cinnamon, garlic, rosemary, and thyme. During the pre-weaning phase, all heifers were fed 5 L of MR/d reconstituted to 15% (dry matter basis), divided into two equal meals. Water and starter were provided ad libitum . During the post-weaning, animals received a maximum of 3 kg of starter/d, and ad libitum corn silage, divided into two meals. Feed intake, fecal and respiratory scores were evaluated daily. The BW was measured every three days, while body development was recorded weekly. Blood samples were collected on 0, 30, and 60 d of age for total blood cell count, weekly and on the weaning day to determinate ß-hydroxybutyrate, urea and glucose, and biweekly for IGF-1. Ruminal parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids, ammonia-N, and acetate:propionate proportion—C2:C3) were measured on days 14, 28, 42, 60, 74 and 90. A randomized complete block design with an interaction between treatment and week was the experimental method of choice to test the hypothesis of the BEO’s effect on all outcomes. An ANOVA procedure was used for continuous outcomes, and a non-parametric test was used for the ordered categorical outcomes, both adopting a CI = 95%. Results indicated that there was not enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis of the effect of BEO in MR on feed intake, performance, body development, and blood metabolites during both pre-weaning and post-weaning periods. However, results indicated that the inclusion of BEO in MR significantly affects the proportion of C2:C3 during pre- and post-weaning ( P = 0.05). Similarly, the effect was significant for basophil ( P ≤ 0.001), and platelet ( P = 0.04) counts pre-weaning. The interaction between week and treatment was also significant for lymphocytes ( P ≤ 0.001), revealing a cumulative effect. Lastly, fecal scores were also significant ( P = 0.04) during pre-weaning, with lower values for BEO. The BEO contributed to ruminal manipulation in pre-weaning and carry-over effects in post-weaning, immunity improvement, and decreased morbidity of neonatal diarrhea in the pre-weaning phase."
https://openalex.org/W3135091374,"Recent evidence reveals a precocious link between language and cognition in human infants: listening to their native language supports infants’ core cognitive processes, including object categorization, and does so in a way that other acoustic signals (e.g., time-reversed speech; sine-wave tone sequences) do not. Moreover, language is not the only signal that confers this cognitive advantage: listening to vocalizations of non-human primates also supports object categorization in 3- and 4-month-olds. Here, we move beyond primate vocalizations to clarify the breadth of acoustic signals that promote infant cognition. We ask whether listening to birdsong, another naturally produced animal vocalization, also supports object categorization in 3- and 4-month-old infants. We report that listening to zebra finch song failed to confer a cognitive advantage. This outcome brings us closer to identifying a boundary condition on the range of non-linguistic acoustic signals that initially support infant cognition."
https://openalex.org/W3133679781,"Participation in cultural activities may protect against cause-specific mortality; however, there is limited knowledge regarding this association. The present study examines the association between participation in a range of receptive and creative cultural activities and risk of cardiovascular disease- and cancer-related mortality. We also examined whether participation in such activities and influence by gender have on this association. We followed 35,902 participants of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT3) of Cardiovascular-Disease and Cancer Mortality from 2006–08 to 2016. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to estimate the risk of specific mortality based on baseline cultural participation. During the eight-year follow-up, there were 563 cardiovascular-disease- and 752 cancer-related deaths among the sample (292,416 person years). Risk of cardiovascular-disease mortality was higher among non-participants in associations/club meetings (22%) and outdoor activities (23%), respectively, as well as non-attendees of art exhibitions (28%). People who engaged in music, singing, and theatre had a 27% reduced risk of cancer-related mortality when compared to non-participants. Among women, participating in associations/club meetings reduced the risk of cardiovascular-disease mortality by 36%. Men who participated in music, singing, and theatre had a 33% reduced risk of cancer mortality. Overall, a reduced risk of cardiovascular-disease mortality was associated with engaging in creative activities on weekly basis to less than twice per week. For both genders, participating in creative activities less than once a week reduced cardiovascular-disease mortality risk by 40% and 33%, respectively. For the overall sample, participating &gt; 2 times per week in combined receptive and creative activities reduced cancer-related mortality by 29%. Participating frequently in both receptive and creative activities cultural activities was associated with lower risks of CVD and cancer-related mortality. Our data suggest that, to counteract the public health burden of cardiovascular disease- and cancer mortality, policies and initiatives to increase citizens’ participation in cultural activities should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3134729897,"Entomological surveillance of local malaria vector populations is an important component of vector control and resistance management. In this study, the resistance profile and its possible mechanisms was characterised in a field population of the major malaria vector Anopheles coluzzii from Port Harcourt, the capital of Rivers state, in the Niger-Delta Region of Nigeria. Larvae collected in Port-Harcourt, were reared to adulthood and used for WHO bioassays. The population exhibited high resistance to permethrin, deltamethrin and DDT with mortalities of 6.7% ± 2.4, 37.5% ± 3.2 and 6.3% ± 4.1, respectively, but were fully susceptible to bendiocarb and malathion. Synergist bioassays with piperonylbutoxide (PBO) partially recovered susceptibility, with mortalities increasing to 53% ± 4, indicating probable role of CYP450s in permethrin resistance (χ2 = 29.48, P < 0.0001). Transcriptional profiling revealed five major resistance-associated genes overexpressed in the field samples compared to the fully susceptible laboratory colony, Ngoussou. Highest fold change (FC) was observed with GSTe2 (FC = 3.3 in permethrin exposed and 6.2 in unexposed) and CYP6Z3 (FC = 1.4 in exposed and 4.6 in unexposed). TaqMan genotyping of 32 F0 females detected the 1014F and 1575Y knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations with frequencies of 0.84 and 0.1, respectively, while 1014S mutation was not detected. Sequencing of a fragment of the voltage-gated sodium channel, spanning exon 20 from 13 deltamethrin-resistant and 9 susceptible females revealed only 2 distinct haplotypes with a low haplotype diversity of 0.33. The findings of high pyrethroid resistance but with a significant degree of recovery after PBO synergist assay suggests the need to move to PBO-based nets. This could be complemented with carbamate- or organophosphate-based indoor residual spraying in this area."
https://openalex.org/W3134989846,"Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of kidney transplant recipients is an outcome evaluation after kidney transplants. Therefore, we investigated the associations among perceived health status, social support, self-determination, post-traumatic growth, and kidney transplant recipients' HRQOL. This study involved a descriptive, self-report survey of 163 kidney transplant recipients visiting an outpatient solid organ transplant center in South Korea. Participants' general and transplant characteristics, perceived health status, post-traumatic growth, social support, self-determination, and HRQOL were collected. Data were statistically analyzed using the software SPSS version 25.0. HRQOL showed statistically significant positive correlation with perceived health status (r = .56, p < .001), post-traumatic growth (r = .18, p = .022), social support (r = .25, p = .002), and self-determination (r = .36, p < .001). The factors affecting HRQOL were perceived health status (β = 0.47, p < 0.001), post-transplant occupation (β = 0.17, p = 0.009), and income source (β = -0.13, p = 0.046). The explanatory power of these variables was 34.8% (F = 28.81, p < 0.001). In the subdomains of HRQOL, the factors influencing HRQOL of mental component summary were perceived health status (β = 0.45, p < 0.001), self-determination (β = 0.27, p < 0.001), and education level (β = 0.18, p = 0.006). The explanatory power of these variables was 34.8% (F = 28.81, p < 0.001). To promote the HRQOL of kidney transplant recipients, an institutional system to assist kidney transplant recipients in returning to work needs to be developed. Additionally, creating an environment that allows kidney transplant recipients to act with self-determination, and developing intervention programs that can enhance self-determination will contribute to enhancing the HRQOL of kidney transplant recipients."
https://openalex.org/W3135648981,"The prevalence of excess body weight (EBW) has increased over the last decades in Brazil, where 55.4% of the adult population was overweight in 2019. EBW is a well-known risk factor for several types of cancer. We estimated the federal cost of EBW-related cancers in adults, considering the medical expenditures in the Brazilian Public Health System.We calculated the costs related to 11 types of cancer considering the procedures performed in 2018 by all organizations that provide cancer care in the public health system. We obtained data from the Hospital and Ambulatory Information Systems of the Brazilian Public Health System. We calculated the fractions of cancer attributable to EBW using the relative risks from the literature and prevalence from a nationally representative survey. We converted the monetary values in Reais (R$) to international dollars (Int$), considering the purchasing power parity (PPP) of 2018.In Brazil, the 2018 federal cost for all types of cancers combined was Int$ 1.73 billion, of which nearly Int$ 710 million was spent on EBW-related cancer care and Int$ 30 million was attributable to EBW. Outpatient and inpatient expenditures reached Int$ 20.41 million (of which 80% was for chemotherapy) and Int$ 10.06 million (of which 82% was for surgery), respectively. Approximately 80% of EBW-attributable costs were due to breast, endometrial and colorectal cancers.A total of 1.76% of all federal cancer-related costs could be associated with EBW, representing a substantial economic burden for the public health system. We highlight the need for integrated policies for excess body weight control and cancer prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3135687383,"Background The use of a mobile phone-based Interactive Voice Response (mIVR) System for real time monitoring of childhood illnesses provides an opportunity to improve childhood survival and health systems. However, little is known about the factors that facilitate its use. This study sought to identify key determinants and moderators of mIVR system use among caregivers in a rural district of Ghana using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Methods The mIVR system was designed to provide real-time data on common symptoms of childhood illnesses after answering several questions by caregivers with sick children. A structured questionnaire with closed questions was used to collect data from 354 caregivers of children under-five living in rural communities, four (4) months after introducing the system. Regression analysis was used to identify key determinants and moderating factors that facilitate the use of the system based on the UTAUT model. Results A total of 101 (28.5%) caregivers had used the system and 328 (92.7%) had intention to use the mIVR system. Caregivers’ level of education and household wealth were associated with use of the mIVR systems (p&lt;0.001). Behavioural intention (BI) to use mIVR system was positively influenced by performance expectancy (PE) (β = 0.278, 95% CI: 0.207, 0.349), effort expectancy (EE) (β = 0.242, 95% CI: 0.159, 0.326) and social influence (SI) (β = 0.081, 95% CI: 0.044, 0.120). Facilitating conditions (FC) (β = 0.609, 95% CI: 0.502, 0.715) and behavioural intention (β = 0.426, 95% CI: 0.255, 0.597) had a positive influence on user behaviour (UB). Mobile phone experience and household wealth significantly moderated the effect of PE, EE, SI, and FC on behavioural intention and usage of mIVR systems. Conclusion The perceived usefulness of the mIVR system, ease of use, social influences, and facilitating conditions are key determinants of users’ attitude and use of mIVR system. These relationships are significantly moderated by users’ phone experience and wealth status."
https://openalex.org/W3134155008,"Rocky desertification is a bottleneck that reduces ecological and environmental security in karst areas. Paper mulberry, a unique deciduous tree, shows good performance in rocky desertification areas. Its resistance mechanisms are therefore of high interest. In this study, a lysine acetylation proteomics analysis of paper mulberry seedling leaves was conducted in combination with the purification of acetylated protein by high-precision nano LC-MS/MS. We identified a total of 7130 acetylation sites in 3179 proteins. Analysis of the modified sites showed a predominance of nine motifs. Six positively charged residues: lysine (K), arginine (R), and histidine (H), serine (S), threonine (T), and tyrosine (Y) occurred most frequently at the +1 position, phenylalanine (F) was both detected both upstream and downstream of the acetylated lysines; and the sequence logos showed a strong preference for lysine and arginine around acetylated lysines. Functional annotation revealed that the identified enzymes were mainly involved in translation, transcription, ribosomal structure and biological processes, showing that lysine acetylation can regulate various aspects of primary carbon and nitrogen metabolism and secondary metabolism. Acetylated proteins were enriched in the chloroplast, cytoplasm, and nucleus, and many stress response-related proteins were also discovered to be acetylated, including PAL, HSP70, and ERF. HSP70, an important protein involved in plant abiotic and disease stress responses, was identified in paper mulberry, although it is rarely found in woody plants. This may be further examined in research in other plants and could explain the good adaptation of paper mulberry to the karst environment. However, these hypotheses require further verification. Our data can provide a new starting point for the further analysis of the acetylation function in paper mulberry and other plants."
https://openalex.org/W3134260973,"Background Active case-finding (ACF), also referred to as community-based tuberculosis screening, is a component of the World Health Organization’s End TB Strategy. ACF has potential benefits but also harms, which need to be carefully assessed when developing and implementing ACF policies. While empirical evidence on the benefits of ACF is still weak, evidence on the harms is even weaker. This study aimed to explore experts’ views on the benefits and harms of ACF for people with presumptive TB and communities. Methods This was an exploratory study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 39 experts from international, non-governmental/non-profit organizations, funders, government institutions, international societies, think tanks, universities and research institutions worldwide. Framework analysis was applied. Results Findings elaborated perceived benefits of ACF, including reaching vulnerable populations, reducing patient costs, helping raise awareness for tuberculosis among individuals and engaging communities, and reducing tuberculosis transmission. Perceived harms included increasing stigma and discrimination, causing false-positive diagnoses, as well as triggering other unintended consequences related to screening for tuberculosis patients, such as deportation of migrants once confirmed to have tuberculosis. Most of the perceived benefits of ACF could be linked to its objective of finding and treating persons with tuberculosis early (theme 1), while ACF was also perceived as a “double-edged sword” and could cause harms, if inappropriately designed and implemented (theme 2). The analysis underlined the importance of considering the benefits and harms of ACF throughout the screening pathway. The study provides new insights into the perceived benefits and harms of ACF from the perspectives of experts in the field. Conclusion This study highlights gaps in the evidence base surrounding ACF and can stimulate further research, debate and analysis regarding the benefits and harms of ACF to inform contextual optimization of design and implementation of ACF strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3135109492,Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has a high genetic diversity. Eight genotypes and 90 subtypes are currently described. Genotypes are clinically significant for therapeutic management and their determination is necessary for epidemiological studies.Tunisian patients plasma samples (n = 6) with unassigned HCV-2 subtype using partial sequencing in the NS5B and Core/E1 regions were analyzed by realizing whole-genome sequencing analysis. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to assign subtypes.Phylogenetic analysis of the full genome sequences of Tunisian strains shows two subtypes within HCV-2. These later were genetically distinct from all previously established HCV-2 subtypes with nucleotide divergence greater than 15% (20% -31%). These two subtypes are proposed as new subtypes 2v and 2w.The discovery of two new HCV-2 subtypes circulating in the Tunisian population confirms the great diversity of HCV-2 viruses and increases the total number of HCV-2 subtypes from 21 to 23.
https://openalex.org/W3135139121,"Mitochondrial genomes are highly conserved in many fungal groups, and they can help characterize the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary biology of plant pathogenic fungi. Rust fungi are among the most devastating diseases for economically important crops around the world. Here, we report the complete sequence and annotation of the mitochondrial genome of Austropuccinia psidii (syn. Puccinia psidii ), the causal agent of myrtle rust. We performed a phylogenomic analysis including the complete mitochondrial sequences from other rust fungi. The genome composed of 93.299 bp has 73 predicted genes, 33 of which encoded nonconserved proteins (ncORFs), representing almost 45% of all predicted genes. A . psidii mtDNA is one of the largest rust mtDNA sequenced to date, most likely due to the abundance of ncORFs. Among them, 33% were within intronic regions of diverse intron groups. Mobile genetic elements invading intron sequences may have played significant roles in size but not shaping of the rust mitochondrial genome structure. The mtDNAs from rust fungi are highly syntenic. Phylogenetic inferences with 14 concatenated mitochondrial proteins encoded by the core genes placed A . psidii according to phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rDNA. Interestingly, cox1 , the gene with the greatest number of introns, provided phylogenies not congruent with the core set. For the first time, we identified the proteins encoded by three A . psidii ncORFs using proteomics analyses. Also, the orf208 encoded a transmembrane protein repressed during in vitro morphogenesis. To the best of our knowledge, we presented the first report of a complete mtDNA sequence of a member of the family Sphaerophragmiacea."
https://openalex.org/W3131103775,"Compartmental models in epidemiology characterize the spread of an infectious disease by formulating ordinary differential equations to quantify the rate of disease progression through subpopulations defined by the Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) scheme. The classic rate law central to the SIR compartmental models assumes that the rate of transmission is first order regarding the infectious agent. The current study demonstrates that this assumption does not always hold and provides a theoretical rationale for a more general rate law, inspired by mixed-order chemical reaction kinetics, leading to a modified mathematical model for non-first-order kinetics. Using observed data from 127 countries during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrated that the modified epidemic model is more realistic than the classic, first-order-kinetics based model. We discuss two coefficients associated with the modified epidemic model: transmission rate constant k and transmission reaction order n . While k finds utility in evaluating the effectiveness of control measures due to its responsiveness to external factors, n is more closely related to the intrinsic properties of the epidemic agent, including reproductive ability. The rate law for the modified compartmental SIR model is generally applicable to mixed-kinetics disease transmission with heterogeneous transmission mechanisms. By analyzing early-stage epidemic data, this modified epidemic model may be instrumental in providing timely insight into a new epidemic and developing control measures at the beginning of an outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W3133707755,"The present study aimed to explore the contribution of the manual sensorimotor system to the memory of graspable objects. Participants in the experimental group underwent a short-term upper limb immobilization design to decrease arousal to their dominant hand. Such designs are known to elicit updating of sensorimotor representations and to hardened use of implicit motor simulation, a process that occurs when observing graspable objects. Subsequently, a free recall and a recognition task of graspable and non-graspable objects took place. We found slower recognition for graspable than for non-graspable objects in the control group, while no differences appeared for the immobilized group. Moreover, the recognition latency for graspable objects tended to be slower for the control than for the immobilized group. These results suggest that a time demanding reactivation of motor simulation is elicited when a graspable object is correctly recognized by control participants. The effect of immobilization could prevent this reactivation, leading to faster recognition. Hence, immobilization selectively affects graspable object memory, showing a close relationship with the manual sphere of the sensorimotor system. We suggest that recognition accuracy would probably be affected in cases of stronger disruption of sensorimotor arousal."

Worldwide, seroprevalence of HBV infection is substantially higher among individuals in correctional facilities when compared to general population. We determined the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with HBV infection among Kuje prison inmates, Nigeria.We conducted a prison facility based cross-sectional study. Interviewer administered questionnaires were used to obtain information on participants socio-demographic characteristics, HBV risk factors, previous HBV test and vaccination history. Blood samples collected from participants were analysed for HBsAg, HBsAb, HBcAb, HBeAg and HBeAb markers using rapid lateral chromatographic immunoassay kit. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis were performed.A total of 271 inmates (63 convicts and 208 awaiting trial inmates) were recruited into the study as participants. The mean age of the participants was 32.7 SD±9 years. HBV seroprevalence (HBsAg) of 13.7% (95% CI: 9.8-18.3) was found. 55.4% (95% CI: 49.2-61.4) of inmates were susceptible to HBV infection, 20.7% (95%CI; 16.0-26.0) had past HBV infection while 10.3% (95% CI: 7.0-14.6) had acquired natural or artificial HBV immunity. Factors found to be associated with current HBV infection (HBsAg) include age-group ≤25years (aOR = 8.0,95% CI: 2.9-22.3), being ever married (aOR = 4.2, 95% CI: 1.7-10.4) and history of alcohol consumption (aOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.3-8.4).This study reveals a high seroprevalence of HBV infection among Kuje Prison inmates, hence the need to introduce prison-focused health intervention initiatives such as HBV screening, vaccination and care to reduce the transmission of HBV infection among inmates and ultimately the general population."
https://openalex.org/W3134634390,"CUL9 is a non-canonical and poorly characterized member of the largest family of E3 ubiquitin ligases known as the Cullin RING ligases (CRLs). Most CRLs play a critical role in developmental processes, however, the role of CUL9 in neuronal development remains elusive. We determined that deletion or depletion of CUL9 protein causes aberrant formation of neural rosettes, an in vitro model of early neuralization. In this study, we applied mass spectrometric approaches in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) to identify CUL9 related signaling pathways that may contribute to this phenotype. Through LC-MS/MS analysis of immunoprecipitated endogenous CUL9, we identified several subunits of the APC/C, a major cell cycle regulator, as potential CUL9 interacting proteins. Knockdown of the APC/C adapter protein FZR1 resulted in a significant increase in CUL9 protein levels, however, CUL9 does not appear to affect protein abundance of APC/C subunits and adapters or alter cell cycle progression. Quantitative proteomic analysis of CUL9 KO hPSCs and hNPCs identified protein networks related to metabolic, ubiquitin degradation, and transcriptional regulation pathways that are disrupted by CUL9 deletion in both hPSCs. No significant changes in oxygen consumption rates or ATP production were detected in either cell type. The results of our study build on current evidence that CUL9 may have unique functions in different cell types and that compensatory mechanisms may contribute to the difficulty of identifying CUL9 substrates."
https://openalex.org/W3135256484,"In last decades, a large body of evidence clarified nitrogen isotope composition (δ15N) patterns in plant leaves, roots and metabolites, showing isotopic fractionation along N uptake and assimilation pathways, in relation to N source and use efficiency, also suggesting 15N depletion in plant DNA. Here we present a manipulative experiment on Brassica napus var. oleracea, where we monitored δ 15N of purified, lyophilized DNA and source leaf and root materials, over a 60-days growth period starting at d 60 after germination, in plants initially supplied with a heavy labelled (δ 15NAir-N2 = 2100 mUr) ammonium nitrate solution covering nutrient requirements for the whole observation period (470 mg N per plant) and controlling for the labelled N species (ṄH4, ṄO3 and both). Dynamics of Isotopic Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) data for the three treatments showed that: (1) leaf and root δ 15N dynamics strictly depend on the labelled chemical species, with ṄH4, ṄO3 and ṄH4ṄO3 plants initially showing higher, lower and intermediate values, respectively, then converging due to the progressive NH4+ depletion from the nutrient solution; (2) in ṄH4ṄO3, where δ15N was not affected by the labelled chemical species, we did not observe isotopic fractionation associated to inorganic N uptake; (3) δ15N values in roots compared to leaves did not fully support patterns predicted by differences in assimilation rates of NH4+ and NO3-; (4) DNA is depleted in 15N compared to the total N pools of roots and leaves, likely due to enzymatic discrimination during purine biosynthesis. In conclusion, while our experimental setup did not allow to assess the fractionation coefficient (ε) associated to DNA bases biosynthesis, this is the first study specifically reporting on dynamics of specific plant molecular pools such as nucleic acids over a long observation period with a heavy labelling technique."
https://openalex.org/W3135291928,"Background Opioid-related overdose deaths are the top accidental cause of death in the United States, and development of regional strategies to address this epidemic should begin with a better understanding of where and when overdoses are occurring. Methods and findings In this study, we relied on emergency medical services data to investigate the geographical and temporal patterns in opioid-suspected overdose incidents in one of the largest and most ethnically diverse metropolitan areas (Houston Texas). Using a cross sectional design and Bayesian spatiotemporal models, we identified zip code areas with excessive opioid-suspected incidents, and assessed how the incidence risks were associated with zip code level socioeconomic characteristics. Our analysis suggested that opioid-suspected overdose incidents were particularly high in multiple zip codes, primarily south and central within the city. Zip codes with high percentage of renters had higher overdose relative risk (RR = 1.03; 95% CI: [1.01, 1.04]), while crowded housing and larger proportion of white citizens had lower relative risks (RR = 0.9; 95% CI: [0.84, 0.96], RR = 0.97, 95% CI: [0.95, 0.99], respectively). Conclusions Our analysis illustrated the utility of Bayesian spatiotemporal models in assisting the development of targeted community strategies for local prevention and harm reduction efforts."

The study took place over the winter of 2019-2020 and was nested within twelve general practices that are part of the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC), the English sentinel surveillance network.648 POCT were conducted. 193 (29.7%) of those who were swabbed had received the seasonal influenza vaccine. The crude unadjusted overall IVE was 46.1% (95% CI: 13.9-66.3). After adjusting for confounders the overall IVE was 26.0% (95% CI: 0-65.5). In total 211 patients were prescribed an antimicrobial after swab testing. Given a positive influenza POCT result, the odds ratio (OR) of receiving an antiviral was 21.1 (95%CI: 2.4-182.2, p = <0.01) and the OR of being prescribed an antibiotic was 0.6 (95%CI: 0.4-0.9, p = <0.01).Using influenza POCT in a primary care sentinel surveillance network to estimate IVE is feasible and provides comparable results to published IVE estimates. A further advantage is that near patient testing of influenza is associated with improvements in appropriate antiviral and antibiotic use. Larger, randomised studies are needed in primary care to see if these trends are still present and to explore their impact on outcomes."

We previously reported the successful vitrification of matured mouse oocytes with enclosed cumulus cells using the calcium-free vitrification solution supplemented with ethylene glycol (EG) by the minimal volume cooling (MVC) method. In this study, we investigated whether our method is applicable to the vitrification of mouse oocytes at the GV stage (GV oocytes). Following maturation and fertilization in vitro, vitrified GV oocytes showed high survival (94.3 ± 2.0%) and maturation (94.3 ± 2.1%) rates. Although the fertilization and blastocyst rates of vitrified oocytes (fertilization: 46.6 ± 4.9% and blastocyst: 46.6 ± 3.0%) were significantly lower than those of fresh oocytes (fertilization: 73.0 ± 7.1% and blastocyst: 71.6 ± 8.0%) (P < 0.01), there were no differences in the ability to develop to term between fresh oocytes (50.0 ± 8.4%) and vitrified oocytes (37.5 ± 4.6%) (P > 0.05). In conclusion, we here show, for the first time, the efficient production of live mice derived from vitrified GV oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3133844745,"HIV coinfection is associated with more rapid liver fibrosis progression in hepatitis C (HCV) infection. Recently, much work has been done to improve outcomes of liver disease and to identify targets for pharmacological intervention in coinfected patients. In this study, we analyzed clinical data of 1,858 participants from the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) to characterize risk factors associated with changes in the APRI and FIB-4 surrogate measurements for advanced fibrosis. We assessed 887 non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNV) in a subset of 661 coinfected participants for genetic associations with changes in liver fibrosis risk. The variants utilized produced amino acid substitutions that either altered an N-linked glycosylation (NxS/T) sequon or mapped to a gene related to glycosylation processes. Seven variants were associated with an increased likelihood of liver fibrosis. The most common variant, ALPK2 rs3809973, was associated with liver fibrosis in HIV/HCV coinfected patients; individuals homozygous for the rare C allele displayed elevated APRI (0.61, 95% CI, 0.334 to 0.875) and FIB-4 (0.74, 95% CI, 0.336 to 1.144) relative to those coinfected women without the variant. Although warranting replication, ALPK2 rs3809973 may show utility to detect individuals at increased risk for liver disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W3134497176,"Cancer and osteoporosis have high incidence rates in older populations. However, the treatment of osteoporosis among cancer patients has not been adequately described. Our purpose was to clarify the current practice patterns of osteoporosis treatment among cancer patients in an academic cancer center, and to analyze the efficacy of treatment interventions. Patient records from April 2009 to March 2018 were retrospectively reviewed, and the study included a total of 316 cancer patients with osteoporosis. After patients' data extraction, the patients were divided into two groups, with (n = 144) or without treatment (n = 172), and compared the outcomes of these groups to evaluate the medication effect. The primary outcome was new radiographic fragility fractures during the study period. The related factors associated with fracture injuries and the rate of adverse events, such as osteonecrosis in the jaw and atypical femoral fractures, were analyzed. The rate of treatment intervention was 45.6% among the patient groups. Among patients in the study group, breast cancer patients (n = 107) were mostly treated (n = 79, 73.8%) with oral bisphosphonate. A significant difference in new fracture rate was observed between the two groups (treatment group, 30.6%; non-treatment group, 54.7%), and the risk of fracture was 42% lower in the treatment group (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.86; p<0.05). Previous chemotherapy, steroid use, and older age were significantly associated with increased rate of new fragility fractures. The adverse event rate was 3.5% (presented in five cases). Older cancer patients who receive chemotherapy or steroids are strongly recommended undergo bone quality assessment and appropriate osteoporosis treatment to improve their prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3134725828,"This study aimed to characterize the lipidomic responses to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and provide new insight into the underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis and potential avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic treatments. This study was performed from January 2017 to October 2018. Lipidomic profiles were generated using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) platform. Spearman’s rank correlation test and multiple linear regression analysis were applied to explore the correlation between changes in the relative abundance of lipids and clinical parameters. Kaplan–Meier methods were used to build 30-day survival curves. From the UHPLC-MS/MS results, a total of 509 and 195 lipid species were detected in the positive and negative ionization mode respectively. Positive ionization covered six lipid classes (glycerol-phospholipids, glycerolipids, sphingolipids, sterol-lipids, prenol-lipids, and fatty acid), whilst negative ionization covered three (glycerol-phospholipids, sphingolipids, fatty acid). Four lipids were selected as targets: PC (16:0_18:1), PC (18:2_20:4), PC (36:4), and PC (38:6). The relative increase of the areas under the curves for all four lipids were superior to the pneumonia severity index and CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age ≥65 years old) for discriminating severe CAP from CAP. Decreasing relative levels of PC (18:2_20:4), PC (38:6), and PC (36:4) were negatively related to fraction of inspiration O 2 ; Changes in the relative abundance of PC (16:0_18:1) and PC (18:2_20:4) had significantly linear relationship with procalcitonin. Patients with an elevated level of PC (16:0_18:1) had significantly longer duration of hospital stays. As the relative abundance of PC (18:2_20:4), PC (36:4), and PC (38:6) decreased, the length of hospitalization days and 30-day mortality rate increased significantly (all log-rank p &lt;0.05). Therefore, using the UHPLC-MS/MS platform’s serum lipidomic approach can help reveal changes in lipid abundance during CAP and establish lipid profiles related to disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W3134978625,"Background Despite advances in immunosuppression and surgical technique, pancreas transplantation is encumbered with a high rate of complication and graft losses. Particularly, venous graft thrombi occur relatively frequently and are rarely detected before the transplant is irreversibly damaged. Methods To detect complications early, when the grafts are potentially salvageable, we placed microdialysis catheters anteriorly and posteriorly to the graft in a cohort of 34 consecutive patients. Glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and glycerol were measured at the bedside every 1–2 hours. Results Nine patients with graft venous thrombosis had significant lactate and lactate–to-pyruvate-ratio increases without concomitant rise in blood glucose or clinical symptoms. The median lactate in these patients was significantly higher in both catheters compared to non-events (n = 15). Out of the nine thrombi, four grafts underwent successful angiographic extraction, one did not require intervention and four grafts were irreversibly damaged and explanted. Four patients with enteric anastomosis leakages had significantly higher glycerol measurements compared to non-events. As with the venous thrombi, lactate and lactate-to-pyruvate ratio were also increased in six patients with graft surrounding hematomas. Conclusions Bedside monitoring with microdialysis catheters is a promising surveillance modality of pancreatic grafts, but differentiating between the various pathologies proves challenging."
https://openalex.org/W3133547236,"To achieve the strategic goals of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), it is necessary to deepen our understanding of terrorist attacks in BRI countries. First, we selected data for terrorist attacks in BRI regions from 1998 to 2017 from the Global Terrorism Database and analyzed their time distribution using trend analysis and wavelet analysis. Then, we used honeycomb hexagons to present the spatial distribution characteristics. Finally, based on the Fragile States Index, we used GeoDetector to analyze the driving forces of the terrorist attacks. The following conclusions were obtained: (1) During 1998-2017, the number of events was the highest on Mondays and the lowest on Fridays. In addition, the incidence of events was high between Monday and Thursday but was the lowest on Fridays and Saturdays. The number of events was the largest in January, May, July, and November and was the lowest in June and September; the incidence of terrorist attacks from April to May and July to August was high. (2) Terrorist attacks showed a 10-year cycle during the study period. Terrorist attacks in the last 10 years of the study period were broader in scope and higher in number compared with the previous 10 years. In addition, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and northeastern Europe saw many new terrorist attacks during the latter 10 years. (3) The number of terrorist attacks by bombing/explosion was the largest, followed by armed attack; assassination, kidnapping, and infrastructure attacks were the least frequent. The core areas of the terrorist attacks were Iraq, Israel, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. (4) The driving force analysis revealed that the indicators ""security apparatus,"" ""human flight and brain drain,"" and ""external intervention"" contributed the most to BRI terrorist attacks."
https://openalex.org/W3134509375,"Household time-use patterns are expected to reflect each household member’s daily activity participation and duration with intra-household interactions constrained by multiple budgets. Among various activities, the allocated activity derived from undertaking a household task is studied relatively less in the literature. Who will take an allocated activity is a discrete choice problem of household task assignment, and once a household member is assigned with one household task, other members will have more time to do other activities. To better understand household time-use patterns affected by household task assignment, this paper proposed a joint household-level multiple discrete-continuous extreme value-multinomial logit (MDCEV-MNL) model with multiple constraints. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) method combined with the simulation-based maximum likelihood estimation method is proposed to estimate the proposed model. Based on the household activity-travel data from Beijing of China, the proposed model is customized to explore elderly couples’ time-use patterns with intra-household interactions affected by household task assignment. Following the findings, policy implications are suggested to build an age-friendly society."
https://openalex.org/W3134720251,"The balancing of supplied energy to energy demand is often very challenging due to unstable power supply and demand load. This challenge causes the level of performance of distribution networks to be lower than expected. Research has however, shown the role of demand response (DR) on the performance of power networks. This work investigates the influence of DR, in the presence of incorporated renewable energy, on technical loss reduction, reliability, environment, energy saved and incentives paid to consumers with the help of PSAT and AIMMS software. Results from simulation have shown that the introduction of renewable energy into a Ghanaian distribution network coupled with implementing the proposed DR improves total energy supply by 9.8% at a corresponding operation cost reduction of 72.79%. The GHG and technical loss reduced by 27.26% and 10.09% respectively. The total energy saving is about 105kWh and 5,394.86kWh, for domestic and commercial loading profiles, respectively. Incentives received by consumers range between 45.14% and 58.55% more than that enjoyed, without renewable energy, by domestic and commercial consumers. The utility benefit also increased by 76.96% and 67.31% for domestic and commercial loads than that without renewable energy. Network reliability improves with implementation of DR. However, the reliability of a grid-connected network is better with a diesel generator only than with the integration of renewable energy. The power distribution companies, therefore, need to consider the implementation of incentive-based demand response program."
https://openalex.org/W3135256221,"Retinal prostheses can restore the basic visual function of patients with retinal degeneration, which relies on effective electrical stimulation to evoke the physiological activities of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Current electrical stimulation strategies have defects such as unstable effects and insufficient stimulation positions, therefore, it is crucial to determine the optimal pulse parameters for precise and safe electrical stimulation. Biphasic voltages (cathode-first) with a pulse width of 25 ms and different amplitudes were used to ex vivo stimulate RGCs of three wild-type (WT) mice using a commercial microelectrode array (MEA) recording system. An algorithm is developed to automatically realize both spike-sorting and electrical response identification for the spike signals recorded. Measured from three WT mouse retinas, the total numbers of RGC units and responsive RGC units were 1193 and 151, respectively. In addition, the optimal pulse amplitude range for electrical stimulation was determined to be 0.43 V-1.3 V. The processing results of the automatic algorithm we proposed shows high consistency with those using traditional manual processing. We anticipate the new algorithm can not only speed up the elaborate electrophysiological data processing, but also optimize pulse parameters for the electrical stimulation strategy of neural prostheses."
https://openalex.org/W3133780406,"Given the increasing attention ambivalence is receiving from the psychological community, it must be asked if pollsters’ (routinely) dichotomous political opinion surveys are missing something crucial. To determine if there is any legitimacy to this question, undergraduates attending a Liberal Arts college in Southern California were asked to rate their level of agreement/disagreement to 28 statements regarding President Trump in two studies, with the items drawn from actual Quinnipiac (Q) and Brookings Institute (BI) surveys. To quantify ambivalence participants were told they could mark one or two responses per item, with double-responses serving as a measure of ambivalence. In Study 1, mean Trump approval ratings divided along party lines, and were consistent with the Q and BI findings. Nonetheless, approximately 40% of participants registered some level of ambivalence across all political-party affiliations, with those defining themselves as Neither Democrats (DEMs) nor Republicans (REPs) showing the greatest degree of ambivalence. In Study 2, ambivalence towards President Trump was examined looking at both party affiliation and political ideology (Conservative, Moderate, and Liberal). Again, roughly 40% of participants displayed some level of ambivalence, with greater degrees of ambivalence for Independents relative to DEMs and REPs, and Moderates relative to Liberals. Given research indicating that ambivalence is associated with delayed decision making and decisions based on “in the moment” contextual information, our findings our suggestive: if political opinion pollsters do not assess ambivalence, they may be missing information on a fair-sized demographic that could influence an election based on negative information (real or fictitious) surfacing only days before an election… as it did in 2016."
