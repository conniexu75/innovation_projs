Considerable intrafloral temperatures are generated. Winds above 3.8 meters per second and cloud abolish the effect. Insects that bask in the flowers also gain heat. The phenomena areimportant in maximizing the small heat budget."
https://openalex.org/W2064935903,"Photosynthesis, both natural and as a model process, is examined as a possible annually renewable resource for both material and energy. The conversion of carbohydrate from cane, beets and other sources through fermentation alcohol to hydrocarbon may soon again become economic in the light of increasing costs of recovery of hydrocarbon from fossil sources and improved fermentation technology. Even the direct photosynthetic production of hydrocarbon from known sources (Hevea, etc.) or newly bred ones seems possible.Finally, more distantly, synthetic systems constructed on the basis of growing knowledge of the photosynthetic processes, may produce both fuel and power."

The rate of injection of energy into the magnetosphere, as inferred from the strength of the disturbance, is approximately linearly proportional to the component of the electric field from dawn to dusk but is effectively zero if the electricfield has a component from dusk to dawn."

The economic justification for adopting these measures can, as a rule, be readily established. If one can resolve the nontechnoeconomic constraints which affect the adoption of these measures, one can look forward to substantial reductions in the fuel required to operate many important industrial processes."

Both the vertical pressure-temperature profile and the molecular hydrogen mixing ratio are determined. The derived value ofthe molecular hydrogen mixing ratio, 0.89 +/- 0.11, is consistent with the solar value of 0.86."

https://openalex.org/W1967345195,"The quickest way to establish a visible new margin against energy demand is the historic producer serving small industry and gasifying Pennsylvania anthracite. In 2 years many producers could be in operation. The quickest way to obtain significant supplies of ""new"" gas or oil is to retrofit existing electricity and industrial boilers for power or industrial gas. Important results could be achieved in 6 years. Table 3 identifies development activities deserving high priority to speed the capture of gas and oil now burned in boilers, and to speed realization the advantages of combined-cycle equipment running on coal (8). Obviously, these activities are not enough. Many exciting and worthwhile concepts at various stages of development can furnish improved techniques for converting coal to pipeline gas and liquid fuels for the long run. Reviews of these concepts are available (6, 32, 35). I have neglected them in this article not to deny their importance but to stress the earlier opportunities from technology that is ready now, or nearly ready. The oil and gas industries might well consider the historical progression from Wells Fargo to Western Union to American Telephone and Telegraph to Radio Corporation of America. These industries will miss the boat if they regard themselves simply as purveyors of their historical fuels and not as purveyors of clean energy. The gas industry especially will be in trouble if it lets its major industrial customers, such as steel and electricity, provide their own supplies of power and industrial gas."

The polymeric sulfur, produced from the ultraviolet photolysis of hydrogen sulfide, exhibits its strongest band at 465 reciprocal centimeters, in fair agreement with the frequency of the unidentified Jovian absorber recently announced by Houck et al. Polymeric octatomic sulfur may be an important constituent of the Jovian clouds."
https://openalex.org/W2095577530,"Low-cost energy has been an integral part of American economic history, but is gone for the present. The European experience has shown that with not much lower levels of per capita income, much lower per capita energy consumption is possible. The present situation with tight supplies and rising prices did not begin with the Arab embargo. A history is followed of the situations that lead up to the 1973 oil embargo. New techniques for the future include oil extractions from bituminous sands and shale, nuclear reactors, harnessing of geothermal and solar energy, and clean burning from coal. Environmental concerns and import independency are discussed. (MCW)"
https://openalex.org/W2098311957,"In conclusion, I feel that the energy challenge, tough as it is, does not pose unsurmountable technological problems, even in Europe. At least in principle, the necessary technology is already there. This article is meant to make that statement plausible. It is not the intention to insist on certain ideas. It is important, however, to have a consistent approach, and this means to obey the timing of the problem. Therefore the most important aspect during the transition phase probably is the buildup of a modern secondary energy system. In the long run it will ibe energy embedding and not the production of energy which will be the principal driving force for the development, because in principle at least there is more than one option to provide almost unlimited amounts of energy. In order to meet the demand for an appropriate embedding of energy, the concept of primary energy parks in the open sea seems to be most promising."
https://openalex.org/W2001553548,"The view is presented that the economic and social system of the whole world will be changed due to the sudden termination of cheap and abundant oil and natural gas. The impact of a sharp rise in the price of energy on the whole relative price structure of different commodities has not been researched, but is now here. It is thought that more effort will be put into supply problems than into the demand adjustments or conservation. If a commodity is cheap now, but will be expensive later, there is something to be said for making it expensive now. There will be forced economizing of it. The embargo forced the higher price of oil, but it is better for it to be high now, and be experiencing the conservation being practiced, than to wait until 1990 when it might be too late to quickly advance technology to have energy at all. There is no bankruptcy in energy. Family-life changes, transportation changes, and food shortages loom from the energy shortages. Oil may be more important as a source of fertilizer than of gasoline.

https://openalex.org/W2089225689,"On the basis of the estimated contributions of these differing methods of the utilization of solar energy, their total energy delivery impact on the projected U.S. energy economy (9) can be evaluated (Fig. 5). Despite this late energy impact, the actual sales of solar energy utilization equipment will be significant at an early date. Potential sales in photovoltaic arrays alone could exceed $400 million by 1980, in order to meet the projected capacity buildup (10). Ultimately, the total energy utilization equipment industry should attain an annual sales volume of several tens of billion dollars in the United States, comparable to that of several other energy related industries. Varying amounts of technology development are required to assure the technical and economic feasibility of the different solar energy utilization methods. Several of these developments are far enough along that the paths can be analyzed from the present time to the time of demonstration of technical and economic feasibility, and from there to production and marketing readiness. After that point, a period of market introduction will follow, which will differ in duration according to the type of market addressed. It may be noted that the present rush to find relief from the current energy problem, or to be an early leader in entering a new market, can entail shortcuts in sound engineering practice, particularly in the areas of design for durability and easy maintenance, or of proper application engineering. The result can be loss of customer acceptance, as has been experienced in the past with various products, including solar water heaters. Since this could cause considerable delay in achieving the expected total energy impact, it will be important to spend adequate time at this stage for thorough development. Two other aspects are worth mentioning. The first is concerned with the economic impacts. Upon reflection on this point, one will observe that largescale solar energy utilization will not cause a greater impact than other new energy sources, based on the reasoning that a self-consistent set of conditions will have to be fulfilled in order to achieve such large-scale use. Without cost competitiveness, other energy resources would fill the requirements, or, if their resource and cost structure also would create severe problems, the economic forecasts simply cannot be fulfilled. We also should not think of a ""solar-only"" energy future. First, there is still enough coal to last for several hundred years. Second, there should be enough fissionable fuel available to operate breeder reactors for a similar time span, and geothermal energy could satisfy some requirements for a long time. And finally, there may be fusion. It would be unlikely that any one of the available options should play a really dominant role. Rather, we should expect to be using an energy mix, just as we do now, with each energy source supplying the requirements which it can satisfy in the most suitable way, and solar energy should play an important role in this long-range future."

An input-output table gives a detailed picture of the flow of goods and services that individual industries buy from and sell to each other in a particular year. The system was used in estimating the impact of 1973- 1974 petroleum shortages on output, employment, and prices. The system was also used to analyze the long- term economic effects of prospective changes in energy technology. A comprehensive study is Wassily Leontief's worldwide model.

The structure and aims of scientific R&D programs should reflect the goals and objectives of stated policy, yet have the flexibility to accommodate evolutionary changes in policy. Project Independence is expected to bring the federal government to embark on a serious attempt to balance supply and demand, such that reliance on imports can be reduced. The view is presented that the goals of the federal programs must be to restrain the growth of energy demand and expand domestic energy supply subject to the usual constraints of economic health, environmental care, and societal acceptance and must be accomplished in a way that will foster improved international relations.

S. pollution regulations on sulfur oxide emissions from power plants prohibit the use of this high-sulfur coal, but reliable flue gas desulfurization processes that permit burning of these coals without adverse environmental effects are approaching full development and should encourage wider use of coal in electricity generation for the next 25 years. The cost of flue gas desulfurization will be high, amounting to about a 3 to 6 percent increase, but may not be as high in comparison to dependence on foreign oil."
https://openalex.org/W2067217838,"It is estimated that less than one-half of the oil in place has been discovered in the U. S. and its territorial waters, and most new oil will come from Alaska and offshore. The drilling rate, the finding rate, and access to favorable petroleum provinces are the factors controlling the discovery of petroleum. Exploration needed for discovery and development of new reserves on the continental shelf will be expensive. A downtrend in drilling rate and finding rate has occurred for the last twenty years. Any technological breakthrough in exploration, drilling, production, or oil recovery; the discovery of a giant field; or substantial improvement in the economic incentives will reduce the gap between domestic crude oil production and demand. Commitment by government and industry to cooperate to solve the problem is necessary. (MCW)"
