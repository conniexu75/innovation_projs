https://openalex.org/W1980054224,"Useful theories and models of the color and constitution of unsaturated organic compounds have been sought for more than a century. The promises of quantum chemistry have not yet been realized satisfactorily. The polymethine concept, a modern chemical theory of constitution, is an auspicious development."
https://openalex.org/W1964449970,"At follow-up in 1976, low-income children who had attended infant and preschool programs in the 1960's had significantly higher rates of meeting school requirements than did controls, as measured by lower frequency of placement in special education classes and of being retained in grade (held back)."
https://openalex.org/W2017358965,"Analyses of soil water and groundwater samples from a high-elevation coniferous ecosystem in New England indicate that sulfate anions supply 76 percent of the electrical charge balance in the leaching solution. This result implies that atmospheric inputs of sulfuric acid provide the dominant source of both H(+) for cation replacement and mobile anions for cation transport in subalpine soils of the northeastern region affected by acid precipitation. In soils of relatively unpolluted regions, carbonic and organic acids dominate the leaching processes."
https://openalex.org/W1994905526,"Studies of the spectral reflectance of the eggs of 25 species of birds from nine families disclosed uniformly high reflectance (often above 90 percent) in the near infrared. This property is associated with the presence of the eggshell pigments protoporphyrin and the bilins. These pigments allow coloration for cryptic or other purposes with minimum solar heating, a combination not possible with the melanin pigments typical of vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1972819111,Members of a free-ranging avian community avoided the mimetic morph of the salamander Plethodon cinereus significantly more often than a nonmimetic morph when offered with the model eft stage of Notophthalmus viridescens and the palatable salamander Desmognathus ochrophaeus. This is apparently the first demonstration of the efficacy of mimetic coloration of salamanders to uncaged birds.
https://openalex.org/W1988886243,An ultrastructural study of pollen-derived plants and normal microspore development indicates that chloroplasts and mitochondria are physically altered during microsporogenesis. These changes appear to debilitate the organelle so that only chloroplasts and mitochondria of the female parent are contributed to the offspring.
https://openalex.org/W2033712312,"Field observations on northeast Ellesmere Island indicate that the maximum advance of the northwest Greenland Ice Sheet was about 100 kilometers beyond its present margin. This occurred before the outermost Ellesmere Island ice advance, which took place more than 30,000 years before present (B.P.). Recession from the Ellesmere Island ice margin began at least 28,000 to 30,000 and possibly more than 35,000 years B.P. During this sequence of glacial events, significant land areas remained free of ice. The late Wisconsin ice extent along both northeast Ellesmere Island and northwest Greenland was extremely limited, leaving an ice-free corridor along Kennedy and Robeson channels. Recession from these ice margins is indicated by initial postglacial emergence around 8100 to 8400 years B.P. The relatively minor extent of late Wisconsin ice in the High Arctic probably reflects a period of extreme aridity occasioned by the buildup of the Laurentide Ice Sheet to the south."

https://openalex.org/W2083482644,"The International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), in Nairobi, provides a laboratory at which a multinational group of scientists pursues interdisciplinary research. In collaboration with their colleagues in biology, ICIPE chemists have characterized the sex pheromones of the tick which serves as a vector of East Coast fever and have identified a termite queen-cell-building pheromone. The structure of many anthropod defensive chemicals have been determined; most interesting of these are the trinervitenes, structurally novel diterpenoids from nasute termites. Several highly active insect antifeedants were discovered using a simple bioassay to screen selected East African plants. These antifeedants may provide leads for the development of new insect-control techniques."

https://openalex.org/W2036386920,"Boron is taken up in the dark and is excreted in response to light by the leaves of the marine vascular plant, Halophila engelmannii Ascherson. This phenomenon makes possible the study of boron metabolism in a higher plant without the stress of boron deficiency. Dependence of boron excretion on photosynthetic CO(2) fixation suggests that an organoboron complex between boron and a newly formed carbon compound from photosynthesis is selectively excreted."

https://openalex.org/W4231344953,"The correct legend for the cover of the 31 March 1978 issue of Science is as follows: Hindfoot prints of a 6-hydroxydopamine-treated rat. Although typically akinetic when it is induced to walk by atropine, the rat's gait is characterized by short steps that may be analogous to that of some Parkinson patients. Here the rat has just been placed on the ground, where it first assumed a broad base of support with the hind legs, then brought its feet closer together and walked forward.
