https://openalex.org/W2007170592,"Protective Abundance Massively repeated sequences are generally dangerous to genomes because they promote recombination and, potentially, genome instability. Eukaryotic ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA), which are highly transcribed, are organized into large arrays of repeats and have a system that actively maintains these large arrays. In getting to the bottom of this apparent contradiction, Ide et al. (p. 693 ) found that reducing the number of rDNA repeats in yeast resulted in a marked sensitivity to DNA damage, owing to heavy rDNA transcription preventing repair of compromised DNA replication forks. It appears that the additional copies of rDNA both reduce the ability of transcription to interfere with DNA repair and provide, through the action of condensin, templates for the recombination-based repair of replication-induced damage."

Using entomological radar, we showed that the ability to select seasonally favorable, high-altitude winds is widespread in large day- and night-flying migrants and that insects adopt optimal flight headings that partially correct for crosswind drift, thus maximizing distances traveled. Trajectory analyses show that these behaviors increase migration distances by 40% and decrease the degree of drift from seasonally optimal directions. These flight behaviors match the sophistication of those seen in migrant birds and help explain how high-flying insects migrate successfully between seasonal habitats."

We demonstrate coherent control of electronic spin states in a double quantum dot by sweeping an initially prepared spin singlet state through a singlet-triplet anti-crossing in the energy level spectrum. The anti-crossing serves as a beam splitter for the incoming spin singlet state. Consecutive crossings through the beam splitter, when performed within the spin dephasing time, result in coherent quantum oscillations between the singlet state and a triplet state. The all-electrical method for quantum control relies on electron-nuclear spin coupling and drives single electron spin rotations on nanosecond timescales."
https://openalex.org/W1994553113,"Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a bullet-shaped rhabdovirus and a model system of negative-strand RNA viruses. Through direct visualization by means of cryo-electron microscopy, we show that each virion contains two nested, left-handed helices: an outer helix of matrix protein M and an inner helix of nucleoprotein N and RNA. M has a hub domain with four contact sites that link to neighboring M and N subunits, providing rigidity by clamping adjacent turns of the nucleocapsid. Side-by-side interactions between neighboring N subunits are critical for the nucleocapsid to form a bullet shape, and structure-based mutagenesis results support this description. Together, our data suggest a mechanism of VSV assembly in which the nucleocapsid spirals from the tip to become the helical trunk, both subsequently framed and rigidified by the M layer."

Ehre et al. (p. 672 ) present a careful and detailed study of the freezing of water drops on both positively and negatively charged pyroelectric surfaces using a combination of optical microscopy and x-ray diffraction: Supercooled water froze at different temperatures, depending on the charge of the substrate with the initial freezing occurring at the liquid-substrate interface on a positively charged substrate and at the air-water interface on a negatively charged substrate. Thus, freezing could be induced upon heating when the substrate charge also changed from negative to positive."
https://openalex.org/W2051714678,"Recent studies have identified range expansion as a potential driver of speciation. Yet it remains poorly understood how, under identical extrinsic settings, differential tendencies for geographic movement of taxa originate and subsequently affect diversification. We identified multiple traits that predict large distributional ranges in extant species of toads (Bufonidae) and used statistical methods to define and phylogenetically reconstruct an optimal range-expansion phenotype. Our results indicate that lineage-specific range-shifting abilities increased through an accumulation of adaptive traits that culminated in such a phenotype. This initiated the episode of global colonization and triggered the major radiation of toads. Evolution toward a range-expansion phenotype might be crucial to understanding both ancient widespread radiations and the evolutionary background of contemporary invasive species such as the cane toad."
https://openalex.org/W2040580133,"Sirt1, a NAD-dependent protein deacetylase, is reported to regulate intracellular metabolism and attenuate reactive oxidative species (ROS)-induced apoptosis leading to longevity and acute stress resistance. We created transgenic (TG) mice with kidney-specific overexpression of Sirt1 using the promoter sodium-phosphate cotransporter IIa (Npt2) driven specifically in proximal tubules and investigated the kidney-specific role of Sirt1 in the protection against acute kidney injury (AKI). We also elucidated the role of number or function of peroxisome and mitochondria in mediating the mechanisms for renal protective effects of Sirt1 in AKI. Cisplatin-induced AKI decreased the number and function of peroxisomes as well as mitochondria and led to increased local levels of ROS production and renal tubular apoptotic cells. TG mice treated with cisplatin mitigated AKI, local ROS, and renal tubular apoptotic tubular cells. Consistent with these results, TG mice treated with cisplatin also exhibited recovery of peroxisome number and function, as well as rescued mitochondrial function; however, mitochondrial number was not recovered. Immunoelectron microscopic findings consistently demonstrated that the decrease in peroxisome number by cisplatin in wild type mice was restored in transgenic mice. In HK-2 cells, a cultured proximal tubule cell line, overexpression of Sirt1 rescued the cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis through the restoration of peroxisome number, although the mitochondria number was not restored. These results indicate that Sirt1 overexpression in proximal tubules rescues cisplatin-induced AKI by maintaining peroxisomes number and function, concomitant up-regulation of catalase, and elimination of renal ROS levels. Renal Sirt1 can be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AKI."
https://openalex.org/W2006445814,"Complex Cooperativity Cooperativity in multisubunit protein complexes is classically understood in terms of either a concerted model, in which all subunits switch conformation simultaneously, or a sequential model, in which a subunit switches conformation whenever a ligand binds. More recently, a “conformational spread” model has suggested that a conformational coupling between subunits and between subunit and ligand is probabilistic. Using high-resolution optical microscopy, Bai et al. (p. 685 ; see the Perspective by Hilser ) observed multistate switching of the bacterial flagellar switch complex that was previously understood in terms of a concerted allosteric model. The conformational spread model gives quantitative agreement with the data."

They share an early developmental origin and are a source of vast amounts of cells with multilineage differentiation potential that are poorly immunogenic and without controversy. Moreover, these cells are likely exempt from incorporated mutations when compared with juvenile or adult donor cells such as skin fibroblasts or keratinocytes. Here we report the efficient generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from mesenchymal cells of the umbilical cord matrix (up to 0.4% of the cells became reprogrammed) and the placental amniotic membrane (up to 0.1%) using exogenous factors and a chemical mixture. iPSCs from these 2 tissues homogeneously showed human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-like characteristics including morphology, positive staining for alkaline phosphatase, normal karyotype, and expression of hESC-like markers including Nanog, Rex1, Oct4, TRA-1–60, TRA-1–80, SSEA-3, and SSEA-4. Selected clones also formed embryonic bodies and teratomas containing derivatives of the 3 germ layers, and could as well be readily differentiated into functional motor neurons. Among other things, our cell lines may prove useful for comparisons between iPSCs derived from multiple tissues regarding the extent of the epigenetic reprogramming, differentiation ability, stability of the resulting lineages, and the risk of associated abnormalities.

https://openalex.org/W2017410521,"Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a microtubule-associated deacetylase with tubulin deacetylase activity, and it binds dynein motors. Recent studies revealed that microtubule acetylation affects the affinity and processivity of microtubule motors. These unique properties implicate a role for HDAC6 in intracellular organelle transport. Here, we show that HDAC6 associates with the endosomal compartments and controls epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) trafficking and degradation. We found that loss of HDAC6 promoted EGFR degradation. Mechanistically, HDAC6 deficiency did not cause aberrant EGFR internalization and recycling. Rather, it resulted in accelerated segregation of EGFR from early endosomes and premature delivery of EGFR to the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments. The deregulated EGFR endocytic trafficking was accompanied by an increase in microtubule-dependent movement of EGFR-bearing vesicles, revealing a novel regulation of EGFR vesicular trafficking and degradation by the microtubule deacetylase HDAC6."
https://openalex.org/W2060307080,"Is centering a stimulus in the field of view an optimal strategy to localize and track it? We demonstrated, through experimental and computational studies, that the answer is no. We trained echolocating Egyptian fruit bats to localize a target in complete darkness, and we measured the directional aim of their sonar clicks. The bats did not center the sonar beam on the target, but instead pointed it off axis, accurately directing the maximum slope (""edge"") of the beam onto the target. Information-theoretic calculations showed that using the maximum slope is optimal for localizing the target, at the cost of detection. We propose that the tradeoff between detection (optimized at stimulus peak) and localization (optimized at maximum slope) is fundamental to spatial localization and tracking accomplished through hearing, olfaction, and vision."

Recently evolved from enteropathogenic Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Yersinia pestis acts as a blood-borne pathogen capable of parasitizing insects and causing systemic disease in mammals (1.Achtman M. Zurth K. Morelli G. Torrea G. Guiyoule A. Carniel E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 14043-14048Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 2.Wren B.W. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 1: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Y. pestis has acquired a variety of complex strategies to overcome defense responses in different hosts to ensure its multiplication and survival (3.Titball R.W. Hill J. Lawton D.G. Brown K.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 104-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Marceau M. Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2005; 7: 151-177PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Pujol C. Bliska J.B. Clin. Immunol. 2005; 114: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although a number of virulence determinants contributing to Y. pestis persistence in mammals have been identified, interactions between Y. pestis and the host immune system remain poorly understood. During its vector-mammal transmission cycle, Y. pestis must evade components of innate immunity in both insects and mammals. One of the initial immune responses against pathogens in vertebrates and invertebrates alike is the inducible humoral defense, including the production of antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species (6.Boman H.G. Hultmark D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 7.Vallet-Gely I. Lemaitre B. Boccard F. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). These inducible effectors, possessing potent antimicrobial activity, are components of the phylogenetically ancient innate immune system that predates the origins of adaptive immunity. Evolutionary conservation among pathogen recognition receptors and signaling pathways contributing to the inducible immune response has permitted the use of alternative model hosts to study innate immunity. In recent years, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has become an attractive alternative model host to study certain aspects of bacterial pathogenesis and innate immunity. Even though C. elegans lacks professional immune cells, it lives in soil environments where it is in contact with soil-borne microbes and has evolved physiological mechanisms to respond to different pathogens by activating the expression of innate immune response genes that are conserved across metazoans. Typically, C. elegans is grown in the laboratory by feeding them Escherichia coli. E. coli is effectively disrupted by the C. elegans pharyngeal grinder, and almost no intact bacterial cells can be found in the intestinal lumen. Once in the gut, however, pathogenic bacteria can overcome innate immune responses to proliferate and kill C. elegans. Infection of C. elegans with Y. pestis KIM5 leads to a persistent and lethal colonization of the nematode intestine (8.Styer K.L. Hopkins G.W. Bartra S.S. Plano G.V. Frothingham R. Aballay A. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, similar virulence factors are required for pathogenicity in nematodes and mice (8.Styer K.L. Hopkins G.W. Bartra S.S. Plano G.V. Frothingham R. Aballay A. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Infectivity and persistence of Y. pestis KIM5 in the nematode makes C. elegans an attractive whole animal system for studying the host response to infection with the plague bacterium. In this study, we examined the transcriptional response of C. elegans during infection with Y. pestis KIM5 to better understand conserved innate responses contributing to host defense during early stages of infection. Our results demonstrate a strong transcriptional response against Y. pestis highlighted by the induction of immune-related effectors that are predominantly regulated by PMK-1/p38. In C. elegans, as well as in other animals, PMK-1/p38 is likely expressed in a range of tissues where it can regulate immune responses at the cell-autonomous level or at the organismal level. Our studies indicate that PMK-1/p38 activity is required in the C. elegans intestine to regulate innate immunity at the cell-autonomous level.

Gravid adult N2 nematodes were lysed using a solution of sodium hydroxide and bleach and washed, and eggs were synchronized overnight in S basal liquid medium at room temperature. Synchronized L1 larval animals were seeded onto modified NGM plates with 0.35% peptone containing E. coli OP50 and incubated at 25 °C until the nematodes had reached the L4 larval stage. Animals were collected and washed with M9 buffer before transferring to modified NGM plates containing Y. pestis KIM5 or E. coli OP50 for 24 h. After 24 h, animals were collected and washed with M9 buffer, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Residual genomic DNA was removed by DNase treatment (Ambion, Austin, TX). Three independent RNA isolations were performed with each pathogen for microarray analysis, and two additional RNA isolations were performed for samples used for quantitative PCR. For each experimental condition, RNA was isolated from three biological replicate samples. cRNA was synthesized from 10 μg of total RNA, and samples were hybridized to the C. elegans GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) by the Duke Microarray Facility. Microarray data were subjected to the robust multichip averaging algorithm using GeneSpring GX software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Analysis of variance t test and fold-change calculations were also performed using GeneSpring software. Transcripts showing a corrected p value of <0.05 were considered differentially expressed between E. coli OP50 and Y. pestis KIM5 experimental treatments. The microarray data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus, accession number GSE20053. Genes showing a significant change in expression by microarray analysis (p < 0.05) were analyzed using FatiGO software (13.Al-Shahrour F. Minguez P. Vaquerizas J.M. Conde L. Dopazo J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W460-W464Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Genes were compared against a 21,249 C. elegans gene data base to identify over-represented Gene Ontology terms and Interpro motifs. Statistical analysis was performed by the FatiGO software using Fisher's exact test and corrected for false discovery rate using the methods of Benjamini and Hochberg. Significant functional terms were defined as p < 0.05. cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using random hexamers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed using SYBR Advantage quantitative PCR premix (Clontech) and gene-specific oligonucleotide primers (supplemental Table 4) on the LightCycler (Roche Applied Science). Relative fold-changes for transcripts were calculated using the comparative CT (2−ΔΔCT) method (14.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar) and normalization to pan-actin (act-1, -3, -4) (15.Shapira M. Hamlin B.J. Rong J. Chen K. Ronen M. Tan M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

RNAi-expressing bacteria were allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C. L3 larval animals were placed on RNAi or vector control plates for 2 days at 20 °C until nematodes became gravid. Gravid adults were then transferred to fresh RNAi-expressing bacterial lawns and allowed to lay eggs for 4 h to synchronize a second generation RNAi population. Unc-22 RNAi was included as a positive control in all experiments to account for RNAi efficiency. C. elegans hermaphrodites treated with RNAi or a vector control were maintained at 20 °C until animals were young adults. Pathogen lawns for survival assays were prepared by inoculating modified NGM (in 6-cm Petri plates) with 60 μl of an overnight bacterial culture. Plates were incubated overnight at room temperature before animals were added. Young adult animals were transferred to modified NGM plates containing Y. pestis KIM5 bacterial lawns and incubated at 25 °C. Animals were scored every 12 or 24 h for survival and transferred to fresh pathogen lawns each of the first 5 days to avoid overgrowth by progeny. Animal survival was plotted using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and analyzed by log rank test using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Survival curves resulting in p values of < 0.05 relative to control were considered significantly different. The time for 50% of the nematodes to die (TD50) was calculated using nonlinear regression analysis of survival proportions (GraphPad Prism) utilizing the following equation: Y = bottom + (top − bottom)/(1 + 10 (logEC50−X)·Hill slope), where Top is set at 100, Bottom is set at 0 ; X is the time, and Y is the percentage of nematodes alive at time X. In this instance, TD50 is equivalent to EC50. A GFP transcriptional reporter plasmid, pDB09.1, was constructed by cloning 1974 bp of the F35E12.5 promoter region (position −15 to −1989 upstream of ATG) into pPD95.79 (Fire Lab C. elegans Vector Kit, Addgene, Cambridge, MA). Wild-type N2 nematodes were microinjected with pDB09.1 and pRF4 to generate the extrachromosomal array acEx101. Integration of the extrachromosomal array acEx101 was achieved by UV irradiation, yielding strain AY101 acIs101[pDB09.1(pF35E12.5::gfp); pRF4(rol-6(su1006))]. Plasmid pDB09.2 was generated by cloning the cDNA sequence of pmk-1 into pPD95.77 (Addgene), creating a translational fusion between PMK-1 and GFP. The vha-6 promoter (17.Wang J. Tokarz R. Savage-Dunn C. Development. 2002; 129: 4989-4998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted upstream of the pmk-1::gfp coding sequence to confer intestine-restricted expression (18.Oka T. Toyomura T. Honjo K. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33079-33085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). pmk-1(km25) animals were microinjected with pDB09.2 and pRF4 to generate strain AY102 pmk-1(km25) acEx102[pDB09.2(pvha-6::pmk-1::gfp); pRF4(rol-6(su1006))]. Western blots were prepared by separating total nematode lysates from 50 adult animals on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferring separated proteins to Immuno-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-GFP-horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Rockland Immunochemicals) or anti-actin AC-40 (1:5000; Sigma) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:1000; Bio-Rad). Blot were developed using SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). Expression levels of the pF35E12.5::gfp reporter in AY101 transgenic animals were analyzed using the COPAS Biosort instrument for large particle flow cytometry (Union Biometrica, Holliston, MA). Synchronized animals treated with control vector or pmk-1 RNAi were exposed to E. coli or Y. pestis for 24 h and washed in M9 buffer prior to analysis. Fluorescence data were acquired for a minimum of 400 adult animals for each experimental sample. Plots were constructed using FlowJo flow cytometry analysis software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR). To investigate conserved innate immune mechanisms that play a role in early response to Y. pestis, we utilized Affymetrix GeneChip C. elegans Genome Arrays to find clusters of genes commonly up-regulated or down-regulated in response to Y. pestis infection. Infection of C. elegans was accomplished by transferring nematodes, propagated on E. coli OP50, onto bacterial lawns of Y. pestis KIM5. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that following ingestion Y. pestis establishes a persistent infection in the C. elegans intestine (8.Styer K.L. Hopkins G.W. Bartra S.S. Plano G.V. Frothingham R. Aballay A. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Even though C. elegans is not known to be a natural host for Y. pestis, this persistent colonization of the nematode intestine by Y. pestis allows the host to properly recognize and respond to pathogen infection. Host response to pathogen challenge was assessed by measuring transcriptional activity of a synchronized population of nematodes exposed to Y. pestis KIM5. RNA was collected from animals following 24 h of pathogen exposure allowing sufficient time for bacterial accumulation within the intestine, yet prior to extensive morbidity of infected animals. Transcript expression levels were compared between Y. pestis-treated animals and nematodes maintained on the relatively nonpathogenic E. coli OP50 to identify factors involved in host response to Y. pestis. Overall, analysis using the Affymetrix C. elegans genome array revealed a change in expression of 258 transcripts (supplemental Table 1). Of these, 99 genes were up-regulated greater than 2-fold, demonstrating a robust inducible response to Y. pestis (supplemental Table 1). Conversely, 27 genes were down-regulated greater than 2-fold, representing transcripts directly suppressed in response to infection or reduced as a consequence of host pathology. Several classes of transcripts that showed changes in expression in response to Y. pestis infection are markers of C. elegans immunity (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Members of gene families encoding CUB-like proteins, C-type lectins, and neuropeptide-like factors that are up-regulated in response to infection with several pathogens (15.Shapira M. Hamlin B.J.

Changes in host transcript levels for nine representative genes were confirmed using quantitative real time PCR (Fig. 1B). For each of the selected genes, the trend in gene expression revealed by real time PCR was similar to fold-change regulation as determined by microarray analysis (Fig. 1B and Table 1). To identify immunity pathways regulating the transcriptional response to Y. pestis, we compared the 126 genes changed >2-fold by Y. pestis with transcripts regulated by PMK-1 and those regulated by the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16 (Fig. 2). Overall, there was significant overlap of genes up-regulated by Y. pestis infection with genes up-regulated by PMK-1 (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table 2). A lysozyme gene, F58B3.2 (lys-5), down-regulated by PMK-1 was similarly down-regulated in response to Y. pestis. Genes up-regulated by Y. pestis infection also showed overlap with genes that were up-regulated by DAF-16 (Fig. 2, A and C); however, greater overlap of genes up-regulated in response to Y. pestis was observed with genes down-regulated by DAF-16 (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data suggest that PMK-1 plays an important role in the control of genes that are up-regulated in response to Y. pestis.TABLE 2Y. pestis induces expression of transcripts similar to those regulated by PMK-1DescriptionSequence IDY. pestis regulationaFold-change of transcript expression was following 24 h of Y. pestis infection in wild-type N2 animals.pmk-1 regulationbFold-change of transcript expression in daf-2(e1368) animals was compared with daf-2(e1368); pmk-1(km25) animals, as described previously (20).CUB-likeF35E12.562.543.6C32H11.129.975.0F08G5.66.2128.9C17H12.85.288.3F55G11.84.686.8K08D8.54.073.5C-type lectinF56D6.29.245.0ZK666.66.88−3.3DUF274Y41D4B.167.963.3PeptidaseK10C2.35.122.5Metridin-like Shk toxinF01D5.32.483.3LysozymeF58B3.2−2.33−2.9a Fold-change of transcript expression was following 24 h of Y. pestis infection in wild-type N2 animals.b Fold-change of transcript expression in daf-2(e1368) animals was compared with daf-2(e1368); pmk-1(km25) animals, as described previously (20.Troemel E.R.

The CUB domain, named for its founding members C1r/C1s, Uegf, and Bmp1, contains 110 amino acids found in extracellular and plasma membrane-associated proteins involved in a variety of different functions, including complement activation, development, tissue repair, tumor suppression, and inflammation (27.Bork P.

Moreover, distinct subsets of CUB-like genes are induced in response to different classes of pathogens (22.Alper S. McBride S.J. Lackford B. Freedman J.H. Schwartz D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5544-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), suggesting that different regulatory mechanisms may tightly control their expression. Of 50 C. elegans genes encoding CUB-like factors, 16 showed a significant change in expression in response to Y. pestis (Table 3), with expression of several of these genes being highly induced (Table 1). This over-representation of CUB-like genes in the inducible response to Y. pestis suggests that they may play a role in host defense. To address whether CUB-like factors contribute to host defense against Y. pestis, we used RNAi to inhibit the expression of individual CUB-like genes and determined animal susceptibility to infection. Of nine Y. pestis-induced CUB-like genes that were evaluated, RNAi inhibition of F08G5.6, C17H12.8, and C32H11.12 enhanced the susceptibility of the nematodes to Y. pestis-mediated killing (Table 4). The minor changes observed by inhibiting individual genes by RNAi could be attributed to incomplete RNAi or redundancy of function among members of the CUB-like family that are induced during infection. Consistent with our findings, RNAi of individual genes that are markers of inducible innate immunity has little effect on the resistance of C. elegans to different pathogens, maybe due to functional redundancy (15.Shapira M.

Tumor cells diffusely infiltrate the brain making focal surgical and radiation treatment challenging. The invasion of glioma cells into normal brain is facilitated by the activity of ion channels aiding dynamic regulation of cell volume. Recent studies have specifically implicated ClC-3, a voltage-gated chloride channel, in this process. However, the interaction between ClC-3 activity and cell movement is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that ClC-3 is highly expressed on the plasma membrane of human glioma cells where its activity is regulated through phosphorylation via Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Intracellular infusion of autoactivated CaMKII via patch pipette enhanced chloride currents 3-fold, and this regulation was inhibited by autocamtide-2 related inhibitory peptide, a CaMKII-specific inhibitor. CaMKII modulation of chloride currents was also lost upon stable small hairpin RNA knockdown of ClC-3 channels indicating a specific interaction of ClC-3 and CaMKII. In ClC-3-expressing cells, inhibition of CaMKII reduced glioma invasion to the same extent as direct inhibition of ClC-3. The importance of the molecular interaction of ClC-3 and CaMKII is further supported by our finding that CaMKII co-localizes and co-immunoprecipitates with ClC-3. ClC-3 and CaMKII also co-immunoprecipitate in tissue biopsies from patients diagnosed with grade IV glioblastoma. These tumor samples show 10-fold higher ClC-3 protein expression than nonmalignant brain. These data suggest that CaMKII is a molecular link translating intracellular calcium changes, which are intrinsically associated with glioma migration, to changes in ClC-3 conductance required for cell movement.

These structures also play key roles in colony and biofilm formation. In all those processes, pili must withstand large mechanical forces. The pili of the nasty Gram-positive human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes are assembled as single, micrometer long tandem modular proteins of covalently linked repeats of pilin proteins. Here we use single molecule force spectroscopy techniques to study the mechanical properties of the major pilin Spy0128. In our studies, we engineer polyproteins containing repeats of Spy0128 flanked by the well characterized I27 protein which provides an unambiguous mechanical fingerprint. We find that Spy0128 is an inextensible protein, even when pulled at forces of up to 800 pN. We also found that this remarkable mechanical resilience, unique among the modular proteins studied to date, results from the strategically located intramolecular isopeptide bonds recently identified in the x-ray structure of Spy0128. Removal of the isopeptide bonds by mutagenesis readily allowed Spy0128 domains to unfold and extend, albeit at relatively high forces of 172 pN (N-terminal domain) or 250 pN (C-terminal domain). Our results show that in contrast to the elastic roles played by large tandem modular proteins such as titin and fibronectin, the giant pili of S. pyogenes evolved to abrogate mechanical extensibility, a property that may be crucial in the pathogenesis of this most virulent bacterium and, therefore, become the target of new therapeutic approaches against its infections.

Among the different species of bacteria, distinct protein architectures allow dynamic equilibration of the pili with such high stretching forces, while still retaining their adhesive function (4Proft T.

Distinctive to Gram-positive bacteria such as S. pyogenes, pili are assembled as a single linear homopolymer of a so-called major pilin, decorated by minor pilins with specific functions, mainly adhesins (4Proft T. Baker E.N. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 613-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). This architecture results from the covalent polymerization of pilins via isopeptide bonds, in a transpeptidation reaction catalyzed by sortase enzymes (6Mandlik A. Swierczynski A. Das A. Ton-That H.

PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e87Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12Yeates T.O. Clubb R.T. Science. 2007; 318: 1558-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), most if not all of the titin and fibronectin modules would be fully unfolded and extended (20Li H. Linke W.A. Oberhauser A.F. Carrion-Vazquez M. Kerkvliet J.G. Lu H. Marszalek P.E. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 998-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). A similar global unfolding and extension in pili would perhaps have deleterious consequences for the adhesivity of S. pyogenes to its host cells. Thus, it is likely that these pili exhibit novel mechanical properties that have not yet been observed in elastic tandem modular proteins. Despite their crucial role in pathogenesis, the mechanical properties of pili from Gram-positive bacteria have not been studied so far. Recent x-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry studies of Spy0128, the major pilin from pathogenic S. pyogenes (M1 serotype), revealed Spy0128 to be composed of two tandem β-sandwich domains, each containing an intramolecular isopeptide bond (21Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Bulk studies showed that the thermal stability and resistance to proteolysis of Spy0128 are drastically decreased by mutations blocking the formation of either or both isopeptide bonds (21Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 22Kang H.J. Baker E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20729-20737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For example, wild-type Spy0128 was found to unfold at 85 °C, whereas mutant forms blocking the formation of either isopeptide bond would lower the unfolding temperature, independently in each domain, by up to 30 °C (22Kang H.J. Baker E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20729-20737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because of the large contribution made by the isopeptide bonds to the thermal stability of Spy0128, together with their suggestive location in the structure, the authors and others concluded that the isopeptide bonds were likely to play a key role in conveying mechanical resistance to the pili of S. pyogenes (12Yeates T.O. Clubb R.T. Science. 2007; 318: 1558-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 23Kang H.J. Paterson N.G. Gaspar A.H. Ton-That H. Baker E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16967-16971Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, no measurement of the mechanical resistance of the isopeptide bonds was provided. In addition, neither x-ray crystallography nor mass spectrometry experiments can accurately determine the proportion of Spy0128 modules forming intramolecular isopeptide bonds in solution. For instance, it is a well known fact that crystallization occasionally induces the formation of covalent bonds in proteins (24Li H. Fernandez J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, the proposed mechanical relevance of the intramolecular isopeptide bonds remains to be tested. Here, we report a study of the mechanical properties of Spy0128 using single molecule force spectroscopy techniques (25Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Fowler S.B. Marszalek P.E. Broedel S.E. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3694-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that Spy0128 cannot be unfolded by mechanical forces of up to 800 pN, revealing this protein to be completely inextensible. We also found that introducing mutations blocking the formation of isopeptide bonds in either module of Spy0128 allowed the targeted module to readily unfold and extend under force while the other module remained fully folded and inextensible. Although our observations revealed Spy0128 to be a mechanically inextensible protein, in rare cases (∼3%), we observed single module unfolding events in wild-type Spy0128 domains. That small population of proteins could easily be missed using bulk techniques. Therefore, the efficiency of the isopeptide bond formation in wild-type Spy0128 may not be 100%. We speculate that the development of pharmacological agents that enhance the rate of failure of formation of isopeptide bonds may represent a novel strategy to greatly alter the mechanical extensibility of S. pyogenes pili, and block the infectivity of this most prevalent human pathogen. All the reagents used were molecular biology grade and were obtained from regular commercial sources. The genomic DNA from S. pyogenes, M1 serotype (ATCC 700294) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cDNA coding for Spy0128 (residues 18–308) was obtained by PCR. The primers employed included BamHI, BglII, and KpnI restriction sites to produce polyproteins following the system described before for I27 (25Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Fowler S.B. Marszalek P.E. Broedel S.E. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3694-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The original cDNA sequence of Spy0128 has a KpnI site that was removed by introducing silent mutations using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA). The same mutagenesis method was used to produce Spy0128 E117A and E258A. The cDNAs coding for (I27-Spy0128)2-I27, and its mutant variants were cloned in the expression plasmid pQE-80L (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using the BamHI and KpnI restriction sites. The final polyproteins have 11 extra amino acids at the N terminus (including six histidines), 4 at the C terminus, and 2 between each module, for a total of 23 extra amino acids. E. coli BLR (DE3) cells were transformed with the expression plasmids. Protein production was induced at A600 ∼0.8 with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C or overnight at 25 °C. Cells were disrupted by sonication, and polyproteins were purified from the soluble fraction by an affinity chromatography using a Talon column (Clontech), followed by an FPLC step using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). The buffer employed was 10 mm Hepes pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl. This procedure rendered homogeneous fractions of proteins, as estimated by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1). Samples were prepared by depositing 1–5 μl of a ∼0.2 mg/ml polyprotein solution onto an evaporated gold coverslip. Veeco MLCT (Camarillo, CA) or Olympus TR400PSA (Asylum Research, Santa Barbara, CA) cantilevers were used. They were calibrated using the equipartition theorem (26Florin E.L. Rief M. Lehmann H. Ludwig M. Dornmair C. Moy V.T. Gaub H.E. Biosens. Bioelectron. 1995; 10: 895-901Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Typical spring constants were in the range of 20–30 pN/nm. To pick up single molecules, the cantilever was pushed against the surface at contact forces of 0.8–2 nN, and then retracted. In force-extension experiments, the retraction rate was 400 nm/s. Experiments were done at room temperature (22–25 °C). In single molecule atomic force microscopy (AFM) 3The abbreviation used is: AFMatomic force microscopy. determinations, it is frequent to obtain traces reflecting spurious interactions. Therefore, only reproducible traces with three I27 unfolding events were analyzed. Experimental results were fitted to the worm-like chain model of polymer elasticity (27Bustamante C. Marko J.F. Siggia E.D. Smith S. Science. 1994; 265: 1599-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). The experimental histograms were fitted using Gaussian curves. In this work, the error of the mean is given by the standard deviation of the Gaussian fit. To estimate the initial extension of the polyproteins from force-extension traces, the worm-like chain model was fitted to the first unfolding peak. A drawback of this procedure is that the results are dependent on the persistence length that is chosen. It has been shown before that the use of force-clamp provides a model-free estimation of initial extensions (28Dougan L. Li J. Badilla C.L. Berne B.J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12605-12610Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The initial extension of (I27-Spy0128)2-I27 measured by force-clamp was equivalent to the one determined by force-extension (supplemental Fig. S5). The retraction of the cantilever from the surface is usually accompanied by the rupture of unspecific interactions that obscure the initial extension of the polyprotein (29Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Fisher T.E. Marszalek P.E. Li H. Fernandez J.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 63-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Therefore, only traces showing a clean initial retraction were analyzed. In addition, traces with detachment forces below 250 pN were excluded from the analysis in order to minimize the possibility of selecting polyprotein oligomers. The exact location of the surface is an important issue regarding the determination of initial extensions. In this work, the extension at a pushing force of 100 pN was set to 0. It was estimated that the same result with 5% maximum variation is found when the surface is located by projecting the force-extension trace at pushing forces between 250 and 500 pN to F = 0. atomic force microscopy. To inspect the mechanical response of Spy0128, a heteropolyprotein composed of two Spy0128 modules flanked by I27 protein domains was produced in Escherichia coli and purified by standard molecular biology techniques (supplemental Fig. S1). This protein was called (I27-Spy0128)2-I27 (Fig. 1). (I27-Spy0128)2-I27 was pulled at constant velocity using an AFM to obtain the corresponding force versus extension curves (18Rief M. Gautel M. Oesterhelt F. Fernandez J.M. Gaub H.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1109-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). I27 is an immunoglobin domain present in cardiac titin whose mechanical properties have been thoroughly studied by force spectroscopy (25Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Fowler S.B. Marszalek P.E. Broedel S.E. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3694-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). In force-extension curves, the unfolding of I27 domains is characterized by peaks around 200 pN with corresponding increments in contour length of ∼28.5 nm. Therefore, the unfolding events of I27 provide a unique fingerprint that serves to identify successful traces (28Dougan L. Li J. Badilla C.L. Berne B.J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12605-12610Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30Perez-Jimenez R. Garcia-Manyes S. Ainavarapu S.R. Fernandez J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40010-40014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As the pilins are flanked between I27 modules, the unfolding of the three I27 domains present in the polyprotein is a signature of events where both Spy0128 have been subject to force. For this reason, only traces showing three I27 unfolding events were analyzed. A typical force-extension curve for (I27-Spy0128)2-I27 is shown in Fig. 1A. The unfolding events corresponding to the three I27 modules are clearly detected as peaks at ∼200 pN. Fits of these peaks to the worm-like chain of polymer elasticity (27Bustamante C. Marko J.F. Siggia E.D. Smith S. Science. 1994; 265: 1599-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar) render peak-to-peak contour length increments, ΔLc, of 28.5 nm. The last peak in the force-extension curve corresponds to the detachment of the polyprotein from the surface and/or the cantilever. No unfolding peaks assignable to the Spy0128 domains were generally observed in these force-extension experiments, even when the polyprotein was pulled at forces exceeding 800 pN (Fig. 1B, inset). Two scenarios are compatible with this result. Either Spy0128 behaves as a random coil that extends before the first I27 unfolding, or it remains folded throughout the experiment. To determine which description is accurate, the initial extension of the protein before the first I27 unfolding event was estimated by fitting the worm-like chain model to the first unfolding peak (Fig. 1, A and B). A similar approach has been found useful to study the mechanical properties of homopolypeptide chains (28Dougan L. Li J. Badilla C.L. Berne B.J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12605-12610Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). If the Spy0128 modules were extending before the first I27 unfolding event, the expected initial extension would be given by the sum of the length of three folded I27 modules (3 × 4.4 nm) (31Improta S. Krueger J.K. Gautel M. Atkinson R.A. Lefèvre J.F. Moulton S. Trewhella J. Pastore A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 761-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the handles and linkers routinely included in polyproteins used for force spectroscopy (23 amino acids × 0.4 nm/amino acid) (25Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Fowler S.B. Marszalek P.E. Broedel S.E. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3694-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 32Ainavarapu S.R. Brujic J. Huang H.H. Wiita A.P. Lu H. Li L. Walther K.A. Carrion-Vazquez M. Li H. Fernandez J.M. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 225-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and the length of the extended Spy0128 (2 × 291 amino acids × 0.4 nm/amino acid) for a total length of 255.2 nm (gray dashed line in Fig. 1B). In contrast, if Spy0128 remained folded, the initial extension would correspond to the extension of the folded I27 domains, the handles and linkers, the folded Spy0128 (2 × 8.2 nm, measured between the α-carbons of residues 30 and 307) and the unstructured regions in Spy0128 (residues 18 to 29 and 308; 2 × 13 amino acids × 0.4 nm/amino acid), i.e. 49.2 nm (black dashed line in Fig. 1B) (21Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). An initial extension of 52 ± 9 nm was obtained from a Gaussian fit to the experimental histogram in Fig. 1B, strongly suggesting that the Spy0128 modules do not unfold upon application of force. Only a small proportion of the traces showed initial extensions of 80–100 nm, probably corresponding to the unraveling of one Spy0128 domain. Those few traces may arise from rare misfolded Spy0128 domains produced in the E. coli expression system used to obtain the polyprotein. In general, the force-extension approach allows the application of high forces during short periods of time. For instance, in Fig. 1A, the polyprotein is held at forces above 200 pN for only ∼15 ms. If the unfolding of Spy0128 was a slow process, its unfolding events may not be detected in the force-extension mode of the AFM. To further check the inextensibility of (I27-Spy0128)2-I27, the polyprotein was pulled in force-ramp mode (Fig. 1C). In this mode, the force is finely tuned by an electronic feedback system that controls the displacement of the piezoelectric positioner to attain the desired force. The unfolding events are now registered as steps in an extension versus time curve (33Oberhauser A.F. Hansma P.K. Carrion-Vazquez M. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The force was linearly varied at a rate of 200 pN/s for up to 5 s. A typical experimental trace is shown in Fig. 1C. In this particular experiment, the polyprotein was subject to forces above 200 pN during almost 2 s. As in the force-extension experiments, only traces with three steps of ∼24.5 nm marking the unfolding of the three I27 domains (34Garcia-Manyes S. Brujić J. Badilla C.L. Fernández J.M. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 2436-2446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) were analyzed. No steps assignable to the unfolding of the Spy0128 modules were found (Fig. 1C). Additionally, in traces showing the I27 fingerprint, most final extensions are scattered around the values predicted by the worm-like chain model if the Spy0128 modules remained folded (Fig. 1D, red dots). As in force-extension experiments, only few traces showed longer final extensions that would be compatible with the extension of some misfolded Spy0128 domains (Fig. 1D, blue dots). Taking the force-extension and force-ramp results together, it is concluded that Spy0128 cannot be extended even when pulled at forces of 800 pN. The presence of one intramolecular isopeptide bond in both domains of Spy0128 has been proposed by x-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry (21Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Mutations abolishing the formation of these isopeptide bonds have been shown to decrease both the resistance to proteases and the thermal stability of Spy0128 (21Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 22Kang H.J. Baker E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20729-20737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). From a mechanical point of view, their location within the structure of the Spy0128 domains is striking, for they would connect the first and last β-strands in both β-sandwiches (12Yeates T.O. Clubb R.T. Science. 2007; 318: 1558-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Taking into account the mechanical strength of covalent bonds, in such a configuration, an axial force would be transmitted exclusively through the isopeptide bonds and both β-strands, leaving the rest of the domain unaffected at forces presumably as high as 2000 pN (35Grandbois M. Beyer M. Rief M. Clausen-Schaumann H. Gaub H.E. Science. 1999; 283: 1727-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Using the same design described above for wild-type Spy0128, polyproteins for Spy0128 E117A and E258A were produced (supplemental Fig. S1). These two mutations have been shown to abrogate the formation of the intramolecular isopeptide bonds (21Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 22Kang H.J. Baker E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20729-20737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As above, only traces with three I27 unfolding events were selected. The results showed that, contrary to wild-type, both Spy0128 mutants unfolded upon the application of force, as indicated by the appearance of two additional peaks in the force-extension traces (Figs. 2A and 3A). These results agree with the mutants retaining the overall fold of wild-type Spy0128, which has also been shown by x-ray crystallography (21Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 22Kang H.J. Baker E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20729-20737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). More importantly, they show that the Spy0128 fold is mechanically stable per se, with unfolding forces of 172 ± 33 pN for the N-terminal domain and 250 ± 96 pN for the C-terminal domain (Figs. 2B and 3B, Table 1). For both mutant polyproteins, the initial extension before the first unfolding event shows that the domain still containing the isopeptide bond remains inextensible (supplemental Fig. S2).FIGURE 3The C-terminal domain of Spy0128 E258A extends upon the application of force. A diagram of the protein construct employed, (I27-Spy0128-E258A)2-I27, is shown (see also legend to Fig. 1). The mutation E258A abolishes the formation of the isopeptide bond at the C-terminal domain of Spy0128 (in the diagram, this is denoted by an open circle). A, typical force-extension trace for (I27-Spy0128-E258A)2-I27 is shown in blue. The peaks marking the unfolding of the Spy0128 C-terminal domains in the polyprotein are labeled with an asterisk.

Approximately 40,000 American women succumb to breast cancer each year, with metastasis causing the overwhelming majority of these deaths (1.Jemal A. Siegel R. Ward E. Hao Y. Xu J. Murray T. Thun M.J. CA Cancer J. Clin. 2008; 58: 71-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (10213) Google Scholar). Metastasis is a multistep process, requiring tumor cells to intravasate into the bloodstream, survive in the circulation, adhere to and extravasate from the vascular network in the secondary organ, and finally adapt to a foreign microenvironment (2.Lu X.

However, its functional role in tumor progression and metastasis remains largely undefined. In a recent study, metabolomic profiling identified increased sarcosine synthesis as a functionally important metabolic alteration during prostate cancer progression (10.Sreekumar A. Poisson L.M.

Similar efforts to identify important metabolic changes during breast cancer progression hold the potential for providing putative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers as well as new therapeutics targets. In the current study, we used the 4T1 syngeneic mouse model of breast cancer to systematically identify metabolite changes. All cell lines used were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific HyClone). All cells were grown in 10-cm tissue culture dishes, and the media were replaced 24 and 2 h prior to metabolite extraction. All samples were harvested at subconfluence. Metabolism was quenched, and metabolites were extracted by aspiration of media and immediate addition of 4 ml of 80:20 methanol:water at −80 °C to simultaneously lyse cells and quench metabolism. After 15 min of incubation at −80 °C, cell remnants were scraped from the tissue culture dish and transferred, along with the methanol:water, into a 15-ml conical centrifuge tube. The resulting mixture was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was moved to a new tube. The remaining pellet was re-extracted twice more with 500 μl of 80:20 methanol:water at −80 °C, and all the supernatants were combined with the original supernatant.

Two different liquid chromatography (LC) separations were coupled by electrospray ionization (ESI) to triple quadrupole mass spectrometers operating in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The LC method coupled to positive mode ESI was hydrophilic interaction chromatography on an aminopropyl column at basic pH as reported previously (11.Bajad S.U. Lu W. Kimball E.H. Yuan J. Peterson C. Rabinowitz J.D. J. Chromatogr. A. 2006; 1125: 76-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The LC method coupled to negative mode ESI was reversed phase chromatography with an amine-based ion pairing agent, with the method used a variant of one reported previously (12.Luo B. Groenke K. Takors R. Wandrey C. Oldiges M. J. Chromatogr. A. 2007; 1147: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), with additional reactions to monitor more metabolites and identical stationary and mobile phases but an altered gradient: t = 0, 0% B; t = 5, 0% B; t = 10, 20% B; t = 20, 20% B; t = 35, 65% B; t = 38, 95% B; t = 42, 95% B, t = 43, 0% B; t = 50, 0% B, where B refers to the methanol-containing mobile phase. LC instrumentation was an LC-20 AD high pressure liquid chromatography system (Shimadzu), autosampler temperature 4 °C, injection volume 10 μl. MS instrumentation was a TSQ Quantum Ultra or a Discovery Max triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mass spectrometry parameters were as reported previously (11.Bajad S.U. Lu W. Kimball E.H. Yuan J. Peterson C. Rabinowitz J.D. J. Chromatogr. A. 2006; 1125: 76-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to grow to subconfluence, at which time the metabolites were methanol-extracted. Four biological replicates prepared over two separate days were used for each cell line. Metabolite extraction and LC-MS/MS analysis were performed. Metabolite signals were normalized to total protein levels within each cell line as well as to the signal in NMuMG from the same experimental day and log2-transformed. Metabolite signals of conditioned media were normalized to the geometric mean for the day the samples were run and log2-transformed. To identify intracellular metabolic changes during tumorigenesis and metastasis, we used LC-MS/MS to profile the levels of 157 different small molecule metabolites (13.Munger J. Bajad S.U. Coller H.A. Shenk T. Rabinowitz J.D. PLoS Pathogens. 2006; 2: e132Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) in the well characterized 4T1 series of cell lines of a murine mammary cancer model (14.Aslakson C.J. Miller F.R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1399-1405PubMed Google Scholar). This series includes five isogenic tumorigenic lines (67NR, 168FARN, 4TO7, 66cl4, and 4T1) that originated from one spontaneous tumor in the BALB/cfC3H mouse. Each cell line displays unique tumorigenic and metastatic capabilities (Fig. 1A). We also included a normal murine mammary gland epithelial cell line, NMuMG (15.Owens R.B. Smith H.S. Hackett A.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1974; 53: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), as the baseline control to observe metabolic changes correlated with tumorigenesis. The normalized intracellular metabolite signals are listed in supplemental Table 1. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the normalized metabolite intensities showed clear separation of the non-tumorigenic line NMuMG from other tumorigenic lines (Fig. 1B). In the tumorigenic branch, the non-metastatic line 67NR was separate from the metastatic lines (168FARN, 4TO7, 66cl4, and 4T1). There was no further subgrouping among the four metastatic lines that was consistent with the increased metastatic potential. These clustering results are consistent with the possibility that metabolic reprogramming is required both during the initial transformation process and during the acquisition of metastatic potential. No further metabolic changes were observed correlated with the quantitatively increased metastatic potential, suggesting that acquisition of enhanced metastatic potential did not, at least in these cell lines, require further systematic metabolic reprogramming. Important patterns in the clustering heat map (Fig. 1B, colored bars) are described below. When compared with NMuMG, all five tumorigenic lines contained a set of metabolites that were significantly more abundant (Fig. 2A). Several intermediates in glycolysis increased in tumorigenic lines, including hexose phosphate (i.e. glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, consistent with the “Warburg effect” of increased glycolysis rate in tumor cells (16.Warburg O. Wind F. Negelein E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1927; 8: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Additionally, ribose phosphate was significantly higher in these cells when compared with NMuMG (Fig. 2A). Ribose phosphate is a product of the pentose phosphate pathway, which also produces NADPH. Ribose is necessary for nucleic acid biosynthesis, and NADPH is the major reductant in fatty acid and steroid synthesis. The building block of fatty acids, malonyl-CoA, was also significantly more abundant in tumorigenic lines (Fig. 2A). This result was consistent with the finding of active fatty acid synthesis in tumor tissues (17.Kuhajda F.P. Nutrition. 2000; 16: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The Warburg effect includes increased lactate production. However, we noticed that lactate was not universally higher in tumorigenic cells (Fig. 2A). This may reflect non-universality of the Warburg effect (18.Zu X.L. Guppy M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), in vitro culture condition (19.Richardson A.D. Yang C. Osterman A. Smith J.W. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2008; 110: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), or metabolic plasticity in response to hypoxia (20.Sonveaux P. Végran F. Schroeder T. Wergin M.C. Verrax J. Rabbani Z.N. De Saedeleer C.J. Kennedy K.M. Diepart C. Jordan B.F. Kelley M.J. Gallez B. Wahl M.L. Feron O. Dewhirst M.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3930-3942PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular transformation was also characterized by decreased levels of a set of metabolites, which were lower in five tumorigenic lines than NMuMG (Fig. 2B). Most notably, the levels of GSH and the oxidized form of glutathione (GSSG) were decreased in tumorigenic lines (Fig. 2C). GSH and GSSG are crucial regulators of the cellular reduction/oxidation (redox) state, with GSH protecting cells from oxidative stress (21.Filomeni G. Rotilio G. Ciriolo M.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Thus, the lower GSH levels in transformed cells suggest that reduced antioxidant activity may sometimes occur early in oncogenesis, perhaps predisposing cells to reactive oxygen species-induced mutations necessary for full-fledged oncogenesis. Continued GSH/GSSG depletion may also sometimes contribute to the acquisition of general metastatic ability as there was a further decrease of glutathiones in the metastatic cell lines when compared with 67NR (Fig. 2C). The free energy of the antioxidant reactions is dependent upon the ratio [GSH]2/[GSSG]. Despite the large change in the combined GSH/GSSG pool size, the ratio of the two metabolites does not change significantly. Thus, the free energy of the reaction is dependent on the level of GSH, and the decrease in GSH levels is mirrored by a decrease in the free energy of the antioxidant reactions, further lowering the ability of the cells to cope with redox stress. To further elucidate the role of the glutathione redox system in tumorigenesis and metastasis, pharmacological inhibitors may be used. For example, treatment of NMuMG with methionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (22.Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7558-7560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could be used to determine whether GSH depletion might facilitate the transformation of the cells. Treatment of the tumorigenic cells with GSHest, a permeable compound that can increase the intracellular content of GSH (23.Filomeni G. Rotilio G. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), might help restore the redox status and decrease tumorigenesis and metastatic abilities. Metastatic ability- related metabolites were recognized as those differentially represented in the metastatic cell lines (168FARN, 4TO7, 66cl4, and 4T1) when compared with both NMuMG and 67NR. A subset of investigated metabolites showed such a pattern; they are significantly more abundant in the metastatic lines than NMuMG and 67NR (Fig. 2D). The majority of these metabolites fall into two groups: the tricarboxylic acid cycle or nucleotides. In addition, three of the four metabolites in the last steps of glycolysis were enriched in metastatic cells, 3-phosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and pyruvate, suggesting differences in lower glycolysis when compared with NMuMG and 67NR (Fig. 2E). Although the exact mechanism is not clear, these findings in lower glycolysis may relate to the pivotal role of specific pyruvate kinase isozymes in oncogenesis (24.Christofk H.R. Vander Heiden M.G. Wu N. Asara J.M. Cantley L.C. Nature. 2008; 452: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Moving down from pyruvate, several tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) intermediates were enriched in the metastatic lines, including aconitate, citrate, isocitrate, and malate (Fig. 2E). The Warburg effects suggest that tumor cells prefer aerobic glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid cycle for producing ATP and reductants. Our observation that tricarboxylic acid intermediates are exclusively up-regulated in metastatic cell lines suggests that invasive cancer cells are using the tricarboxylic acid cycle differently than the non-metastatic cells. It is unclear, however, whether these differences are associated with increased tricarboxylic acid cycle flux, and if so, whether this flux is driven primarily by glucose or glutamine. Fluxomic analysis is well suited for answering these questions in future studies (25.Munger J. Bennett B.D. Parikh A. Feng X.J. McArdle J. Rabitz H.A. Shenk T. Rabinowitz J.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The changes of nucleotide species follow an interesting pattern. Levels are lower in the non-metastatic tumor cells (67NR) than in the non-transformed cells, perhaps due to enhanced nucleotide consumption to feed growth and DNA replication in the transformed cells. The metastatic tumor cells, however, have increased nucleotide levels, reflecting altered nucleotide turnover. To identify any changes of extracellular metabolites, growth media conditioned by cells for 24 h were profiled (supplemental Table 2). Largely consistent with the intracellular metabolite clustering, the extracellular metabolites also clustered metastatic lines (168FARN, 4TO7, 66cl4, and 4T1) in one branch, separated from the branch containing NMuMG and 67NR as well as the unconditioned media control (Fig. 3A). This result suggested quantitative differences in extracellular metabolites between non-metastatic cells and metastatic cells, yet the influence of transformation was not revealed, possibly due to the limited number of metabolites profiled. One challenge in interpreting the results is to distinguish which metabolites were secreted by tumor cells and which were left over from the consumption of the media. Because the growth media were Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 7.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, all the small molecule compounds should derive from DMEM (amino acids, vitamins, glucose, and inorganic salts). Among the metabolites not included in the DMEM components, i.e. secreted from cells, two interesting patterns were noted (Fig. 3A, blue and orange bars). In the cluster of metabolites highlighted by the blue bar, several metabolites were more abundant in the metastatic lines (Fig. 3B). In particular, malate and fumarate were consistently higher in all four metastatic lines, whereas citrate/isocitrate and aconitate were higher in at least three of the lines. These metabolites all belong to the tricarboxylic acid cycle, consistent with the increased levels of these compounds as the intracellular form in the metastatic cell lines (Fig. 2, D and E). Another interesting pattern, highlighted by the orange bar, was the higher level of several nucleotide metabolism players, including guanine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, and deoxyguanosine, in the more metastatic cell lines 4TO7, 66cl4, and 4T1 when compared with NMuMG, 67NR, and the weakly metastatic 168FARN (Fig. 3C). Again, this trend was consistent with the finding of changes of intracellular nucleotide species (Fig. 2D). Overall, the data reinforce the conclusion from the analysis of intracellular metabolites; tricarboxylic acid cycle and nucleotide metabolism alterations accompany the acquisition of metastatic potential in the cell line series. Several amino acids showed significantly less abundance in the metastatic cell conditioned media (Fig. 3A, green bar, and Fig. 3D), presumably due to more consumption of amino acids by the more aggressive cells; thus, they were not considered as changes of secreted metabolites. Another group of metabolites showed a similarly higher level in all cell lines when compared with the unconditioned media (Fig. 3A, purple bar) and were not further scrutinized. Malignant transformation of normal epithelial cells and metastatic ability acquisition have usually been studied with the aim to identify genes and proteins that play tumor-promoting or suppressive roles (26.Hahn W.C. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 27.Gupta G.P. Massagué J. Cell. 2006; 127: 679-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar, 28.Kang Y. Breast Dis. 2006; 26: 129-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pace of finding such molecules has been tremendously accelerated with the development of transcriptomics and proteomics to look for transcripts and proteins with altered abundance during malignancy. Another aspect of molecular changes, altered metabolism, was less explored, although the phenomenon of aerobic glycolysis was one of the first major discoveries in cancer research (16.Warburg O. Wind F. Negelein E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1927; 8: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Fortunately, the situation is improving because of the recent technical advances in global analysis of metabolites using mass spectrometry or high resolution 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (8.Griffin J.L. Shockcor J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). High throughput metabolomic analysis allows simultaneous quantification of hundreds of metabolites belonging to a diverse array of metabolic pathways in a panel of cell lines or tissues. As illustrated in this study, 157 metabolites were profiled in six cell lines with progressively increased tumorigenicity and metastatic ability. The analysis of intracellular metabolites clustered the lines into three categories: normal, tumorigenic (but non-metastatic), and metastatic in general. Results from the analysis favor a two-step metabolic progression hypothesis during mammary tumor progression (Fig. 3E). The first step accompanies the acquisition of tumorigenicity and includes altered glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and fatty acid synthesis, as well as decreased GSH/GSSG redox pool; the second step is correlated with the gain of the general metastatic ability and includes further changes in glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), further depletion of the glutathione species, and increased nucleotides. No further metabolite alterations correlated with stepwise increase of metastasis potential in the four metastatic lines were resolved in the analysis. This model suggests that the fine regulation of the ability to colonize distant organs in breast cancer may not require further dramatic biochemical reprogramming and may instead rely more on alterations in gene expression regulation and cellular behaviors, although we cannot rule out the potential importance of metabolomic changes in metastatic lesions in vivo in different target organs. Our analysis of extracellular metabolites identified increased abundance of tricarboxylic acid cycle components as well as nucleotide metabolism intermediates, similar to the intracellular results. Our findings agree with a recent study profiling a more limited set of metabolites in the MCF10 model of mammary carcinoma (19.Richardson A.D. Yang C. Osterman A. Smith J.W. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2008; 110: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Both studies find evidence for increased pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and fatty acid biosynthetic activity in transformed and/or metastatic cells (19.Richardson A.D. Yang C. Osterman A. Smith J.W. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2008; 110: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Further efforts should investigate the universality of our findings with other in vitro and in vivo preclinical models as well as with human samples. Confirmed altered metabolic pathways may open new therapeutic avenues for treating malignant breast cancer. Several secreted metabolites accompanying the increased metastatic potential (malate, fumarate, deoxyguanosine, guanine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine) should be tested for their value as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of malignant breast cancer in future studies.

Proper chromosome segregation depends on a faithful interaction between spindle microtubules and kinetochores. Several components of the nuclear pore complex/nucleoporins play critical roles in orchestrating the rapid remodeling events that occur during mitosis. Our recent studies revealed that the nucleoporin, Rae1, plays critical roles in maintaining spindle bipolarity. Here, we show association of another nucleoporin, termed Tpr (translocated promoter region), with the molecular motors dynein and dynactin, which both orchestrate with the spindle checkpoints Mad1 and Mad2 during cell division. Overexpression of Tpr enhanced multinucleated cell formation. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Tpr caused a severe lagging chromosome phenotype and disrupted spindle checkpoint proteins expression and localization. Next, we performed a series of rescue and dominant negative experiments to confirm that Tpr orchestrates proper chromosome segregation through interaction with dynein light chain. Our data indicate that Tpr functions as a spatial and temporal regulator of spindle checkpoints, ensuring the efficient recruitment of checkpoint proteins to the molecular motor dynein to promote proper anaphase formation.

The vertebrate NPC is composed of about 30 proteins, termed nucleoporins (Nups), each of which is present in multiple copies (1.Terry L.J. Shows E.B. Wente S.R.

Nucleoporin Tpr (translocated promoter region) (6.Mitchell P.J. Cooper C.S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 383-388PubMed Google Scholar) is ∼265 kDa and exists as a coiled-coil-dominated homodimer of extended rod-like shape (7.Byrd D.A. Sweet D.J. Panté N. Konstantinov K.N. Guan T.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1801-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Tpr contains two domains: an N-terminal domain of around 1600 residues that forms a parallel two-stranded coiled-coil, which is interrupted periodically along its length (9.Bangs P. Burke B. Powers C. Craig R. Purohit A. Doxsey S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1801-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10.Cordes V.C. Hase M.E. Müller L. Exp.

The 800 residues of the C-terminal domain are nonhelical and highly enriched in acidic residues (12.Frosst P. Guan T. Subauste C. Hahn K. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Tpr does not possess nucleoporin FG repeats, but it does contain numerous heptad repeat or leucine zipper motifs. Tpr binds to Nup153; when Nup153 is depleted using siRNA, Tpr is released from the NPC into the nucleoplasm (13.Hase M.E. Cordes V.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1923-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Different metazoan species have been shown to contain only one Tpr ortholog; however, two probable homologs exist in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (14.Kuznetsov N.V. Sandblad L. Hase M.E. Hunziker A. Hergt M. Cordes V.C. Chromosoma. 2002; 111: 236-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the budding yeast, these paralogs are called Mlp1 and Mlp2 (15.Strambio-de-Castillia C. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 839-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A homolog has also been identified as a nuclear pore anchor in plants (16.Xu X.M. Rose A. Muthuswamy S. Jeong S.Y. Venkatakrishnan S. Zhao Q. Meier I. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1537-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Disruption of either Mlp gene is not lethal and does not notably affect any type of nucleocytoplasmic transport (15.Strambio-de-Castillia C. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 839-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Mammalian Tpr was named according to its initial isolation from a carcinogen-treated osteogenic sarcoma cell line, as part of a chromosomal translocation (1q25:7q31) that fused N-terminal sequences of Tpr to the kinase domain of the protooncogene, Met (6.Mitchell P.J. Cooper C.S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 383-388PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Frosst P. Guan T. Subauste C. Hahn K. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Tpr has also been found translocated with NTrk1 (TrkA), the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor for nerve growth factor (17.Xu S. Powers M.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 20: 620-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Tpr-NTrk1 is one of several translocations of the NTrk1 receptor that are associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma, the most common type of thyroid cancer (17.Xu S. Powers M.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 20: 620-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cancer cells also frequently exhibit abnormal numbers of chromosomes (aneuploidy) (18.Rao C.V. Yamada H.Y. Yao Y. Dai W. Carcinogenesis. 2009; 30: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mis-segregation of chromosomes may result from various causes, including spindle assembly defects, abnormal centrosome formation, impairments in attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores, and failure of cytokinesis (18.Rao C.V. Yamada H.Y. Yao Y. Dai W. Carcinogenesis. 2009; 30: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19.Wong R.W. Blobel G. Coutavas E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 19783-19787Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, during cell division, chromosomes undergo condensation, and the nuclear membrane and NPCs are disassembled (20.Mackay D.R. Elgort S.W. Ullman K.S. Mol. Biol.

Recently, Tpr and its homologs have been shown to localize on the spindle pole (28.Qi H. Rath U. Wang D. Xu Y.Z. Ding Y. Zhang W. Blacketer M.J. Paddy M.R. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Mol.

Sterling H. Burlingame A. McCormick F. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2926-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); however, little is known about the basis of Tpr-Mad1 interactions. Mad1 and Mad2 are spindle assembly checkpoint proteins and localize to kinetochores in prophase and generate a signal that inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex until all kinetochores are properly attached to microtubules (32.De Souza C.P. Hashmi S.B. Nayak T. Oakley B. Osmani S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 2146-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33.Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). When correct kinetochore microtubule attachments have been made, Mad1 and Mad2, together with other spindle assembly checkpoint proteins, are removed from kinetochores, the spindle assembly checkpoint is turned off, and sister chromatids segregate (33.Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). In addition, kinetochore-associated dynein drives poleward chromosome movement and contributes to tension generation across sister kinetochores (34.Howell B.J. McEwen B.F. Canman J.C. Hoffman D.B.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 19783-19787Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) to spindle poles for proper spindle organization. In addition to Rae1·NuMA, the dynein motor is involved in many aspects of mitosis and specifically in checkpoint protein transport, such as Mad2 removal from kinetochores at the metaphase–anaphase transition (34.Howell B.J. McEwen B.F. Canman J.C. Hoffman D.B. Farrar E.M. Rieder C.L. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1159-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 40.Yang Z. Guo J. Chen Q. Ding C. Du J. Zhu X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4062-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because spindle checkpoint proteins, such as Mad2 and BubR1, are also removed from kinetochores, the transport contributes to inactivation of the checkpoint (34.Howell B.J. McEwen B.F. Canman J.C. Hoffman D.B. Farrar E.M. Rieder C.L. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1159-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Here, we provide several lines of evidence that Tpr through association with the dynein complex spatiotemporally regulated the spindle checkpoint proteins (such as Mad1 and Mad2), thereby preventing aneuploidy formation during metaphase–anaphase transition. The plasmid encoding full-length human Tpr, tagged with GFP, was a kind gift from Dr. Larry Gerace (The Scripps Research Institute). Three Tpr fragments (N, M, and C) were subcloned by PCR from pEGFPC1-Tpr into pET28a-FLAG, (pET28a modified to contain a C-terminal FLAG epitope together with an N-terminal His6 tag). HeLa cell cDNA was synthesized using a SuperScriptTM III CellsDirect cDNA Synthesis System kit (Invitrogen). The full-length dynein intermediate (DIC) chain, dynein light chain (DLC/DYNLL1/DLC8), and the Mad1 coding regions were PCR-amplified from cDNAs and subcloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech Laboratories) or into pET28a-GST. GFP-H2B plasmid was from Addgene. The details of expression constructs and cloning primers are listed in supplemental Table 1. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Sequence analyses were performed at the DNA sequencing facility of the Kanazawa University Cancer Research Institute using a PRISM3100-AvantGenetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). DNA and protein data bases were searched using the BLAST or BLAT search algorithms at the NCBI. HeLa, HEK293T, MCF7 and NIH3T3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were synchronized in S phase by double thymidine block using 2 mm thymidine (19.Wong R.W.

HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-Tpr (full-length) plasmid using Turbofect, following the manufacturer's protocol (Fermentas). The HeLa EGFP-H2B cell line was generated by transfection of EGFP-H2B cDNA to HeLa cells and maintained in G418 (600 μg/ml). The HeLa EGFP-H2B cell line was used for analysis of mitotic progression. siRNA duplexes targeting Tpr (sc-45343), dynein HC siRNA (sc-43738), and control siRNA (sc-37007) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. siRNA transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000, following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) (19.Wong R.W.

HeLa cells were transfected 24 h before the initiation of the first thymidine block and collected or imaged 72 h after transfection. If necessary, transfection efficiency was monitored with Block-iT (Invitrogen). α-Tpr polyclonal antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Larry Gerace (12.Frosst P. Guan T. Subauste C. Hahn K. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). α-Dynein monoclonal antibody (D5167) (clone 74.1) was from Sigma-Aldrich. α-DLC monoclonal (sc-80295), α-Mad1 (sc47746), α-CENP-E (sc56286) and α-Mad2 (sc-47747) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. α-Dynactin (612709) monoclonal antibody was from BD. α-Tubulin (DM1A) monoclonal antibody and γ-tubulin antibody were from Sigma-Aldrich. α-Nup153 (ab24700) and α-GFP (ab6556) antibodies were from Abcam, α-m414(MMS-120R) antibody was from COVANCE. Anti-GST(30001) antibody was from Thermo-Scientific. Secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes. For immunofluorescence, synchronized HeLa cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were mounted onto coverslips with ProLong Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and were examined on a Zeiss LSM5 EXCITER confocal microscope, and all images were acquired using an aplan-Apochromat 63X with a 1.4-N.A. objective or at 100 × with a 1.4-N.A. objective. For immunoprecipitations, ∼107 cells were seeded and synchronized as described above. Mitotic HeLa cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, spun at 400 × g for 10 min, and lysed in 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C at 14,000 × g. The resulting lysate supernatants were precleared with 50 μl of protein A/G bead slurry (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mixed with 10 μl of various antibodies as specified, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. The beads were then washed five times with 500 μl of lysis buffer. After the last wash, 50 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE blue loading buffer (New England Biolabs) was added to the bead pellet before loading. For expression of Tpr fragments, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-Condon plus cells and pLys cells (Stratagene) were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6 and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 18 °C for 7 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). The cells were lysed with a cell sonicator (SMT), and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 60 min. The proteins containing the His6 tag were purified by nickel-affinity (Qiagen) chromatography, and proteins containing the GST tag were purified by glutathione affinity (GE Healthcare). Proteins were expressed using the Promega TNT coupled transcription/translation system according to the manufacturer's protocol or described previously (19.Wong R.W. Blobel G. Coutavas E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 19783-19787Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27.Wong R.W. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 15441-15445Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Each GST-tagged protein was loaded onto glutathione-agarose beads (GE Healthcare) in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 150 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton-X100, 1 × protease inhibitor mixture) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 300 mm KCl) and incubated with in vitro translated proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with wash buffer. After the last wash, 1 × SDS-PAGE blue loading buffer was added to the beads before loading. Time-lapse analysis of histone dynamics during metaphase and anaphase transition in live cells was recorded by GFP-H2B stable cell lines. Cells were placed in a microincubation chamber (7136; Corning) on the stage of a Zeiss LSM5 confocal microscope, which was heated to 37 °C and equipped with CO2 supply (Electric CO2 Microscope Stage Incubator; OKO Lab). Time-lapse series were generated by collecting photographs every 3 min; the photographs were then converted to 8-bit images and processed by Adobe Photoshop CS2 and QuickTime software. Tpr interacted with spindle checkpoints throughout the cell cycle (31.Lee S.H. Sterling H. Burlingame A. McCormick F. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2926-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and we found that Tpr overexpression enhanced multinucleation and aneuploidy formation (supplemental text and supplemental Fig. S1). We hypothesized that Tpr may spatiotemporally regulate the recruitment of the checkpoint proteins, to the dynein complex during the metaphase–anaphase transition. Before testing this hypothesis, we first examined whether Tpr was associated with the dynein complex in HeLa cells that were synchronized by a double thymidine block. By immunoblotting anti-Tpr immunoprecipitates, we detected coprecipitating dynein, along with dynactin (p150-Glued), DLC, Mad1, Mad2, and Nup153 (Fig. 1A, left). Conversely, using anti-dynein antibodies, we immunoprecipitated Tpr and dynactin (p150), DLC, Mad1, Mad2, but not Nup153 (Fig. 1A, right). These data suggested that Tpr interacts with the dynein complex. Consistent with the immunoprecipitation data, we found that Tpr colocalized transiently with tubulin, dynactin and dynein (Fig. 1, B–D, and supplemental Fig. S2, A–C) from prophase to anaphase. Moreover, we also found that Tpr partially localized on the kinetochores (CENP-E as kinetochore metaphase–anaphase marker) (supplemental Fig. S2D). These data suggest that a population of Tpr transiently colocalized with the dynein complex at the metaphase–anaphase transition. We further investigated whether endogenous DLC/DYNLL1 (a region used to transport cargoes/protein complexes) interacted with Tpr during mitosis. In digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells, Tpr localized to kinetochores, and colocalized with DLC at the mitotic spindles (Fig. 2A). To examine more closely the binding of Tpr to DLC, which was suggested by the confocal microscopy data (Fig. 2A), and to map biochemically the region of Tpr that interacts with DLC, we constructed three cDNA fragments covering the entire length of Tpr (named Tpr-N(1–774aa), Tpr-M(775–1700aa), and Tpr-C(1701–2351aa), respectively) (Fig. 2B) and expressed them in a cell-free reticulocyte translation system. Next, we performed GST pulldown assays. Only the Tpr-M fragment interacted directly with GST-DLC, but not with the GST vector (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S3). In addition, as a control, we confirmed that GST-Mad1 interacted with Tpr-N(1–774) (31.Lee S.H. Sterling H. Burlingame A. McCormick F. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2926-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine whether dynein regulated the function of Tpr, we first analyzed the overexpression of GFP-Tpr (full-length) in HeLa cells. We found that the dynein staining localized to the kinetochore or spindle was more diffuse (Fig. 2D) compared with the endogenous staining (Fig. 2A). Next, we employed a dynein siRNA knockdown approach. Immunoblot analysis of HeLa cells subjected to dynein siRNA treatment for 3 days revealed an ∼85% reduction of dynein compared with controls (Fig. 3A, left). The same immunoblot membrane was reprobed with tubulin to ensure equivalent loading (Fig. 3A, right). Moreover, we did not find any significant changes in Mad1 and Mad2 expression (Fig. 3B). We also found that the number of multinucleated cells increased (Fig. 3D). Loss of dynein had little, if any, effect on Tpr protein levels, as estimated by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting experiments (Fig. 3, B and D). We next assessed chromosome defects and Tpr localization in dynein-depleted HeLa cells using antibodies against dynein and Tpr. In this way, cells specifically depleted of dynein could be observed and quantified using confocal microscopy. Notably, depletion of dynein abolished Tpr localization at the kinetochore, in contrast with its endogenous expression pattern (Fig. 1); however, Tpr was still localized in the nuclear rim during the interphase (Fig. 3D). We further found the accumulation of abnormal, or the ineffective congression of chromosomes, at the metaphase plates. In particular, “chromosome lagging” and multipolar phenotypes were increased by 25 and 21%, respectively (Fig. 3, C and D). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that knockdown of dynein in vertebrates abolished kinetochore localization of Tpr. We speculate that once Tpr is no longer localized on kinetochores, chromosome lagging phenotypes are enhanced. The above results prompted us to test the consequences of Tpr depletion on dynein localization. Immunoblot analysis of HeLa cells subjected to Tpr siRNA treatment for 3 days revealed a ∼75% reduction of Tpr compared with control cells (Fig. 4A, left). The same immunoblot membrane was reprobed with tubulin to ensure equivalent loading (Fig. 4A, right). Double staining with m414, a nuclear pore marker, showed that loss of Tpr had little, if any, effect on the nuclear rim staining, which retained its usual punctuate distribution. 4H. Nakano, T. Funasaka, C. Hashizume, and R. W. Wong, unpublished data. Furthermore, when Tpr knockdown was not complete (Fig. 4C, white asterisk), some dynein was still localized in kinetochores (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, when Tpr was almost completely knocked down, dynein localization was abolished from kinetochores, and chromosome separation defects were found (Fig. 4, C and E, white arrows). Notably, mitotic Tpr siRNA treatment (Fig. 4D) was consistently associated with abnormal congression of chromosomes at the metaphase or anaphase plate (Fig. 4, E–G and supplemental Fig. S4, white arrow). Most importantly, more than 39% of anaphase cells had lagging chromosomes, whereas these defects were not found in control cells (Fig. 4, E–G) in three independent experiments (n = 300 mitotic cells). To support this lagging chromosomes notion further, we performed live cell imaging siRNA Tpr or control siRNA transfected into GFP-H2B stable cell lines. We recorded the live cell imaging video of the lagging chromosomes phenotypes in siRNA Tpr GFP-H2B cell lines very easily (supplemental Fig. S5 and supplemental video 2), but they were rarely found in control (supplemental Fig. S5 and supplemental video 1). Together, these data strongly indicated that knock-down Tpr causes lagging chromosomes enhanced aneuploidy formation. Moreover, to determine whether the observed Tpr depletion phenotypes are different manifestations of the same defects or whether mitotic roles of Tpr can be uncoupled, we employed a rescue strategy by overexpressing GFP-Tpr (full-length) in Tpr knockdown cells. 24 h after transfection of GFP-Tpr (full-length) into Tpr RNAi knockdown cells, the lagging chromosome phenotypes were partially rescued (Fig. 5C and supplemental Fig. S6A). Indeed, a clear point revealed by this rescue strategy is that Tpr is the “criminal protein” causing lagging chromosomes. In light of these observations, it is worth noting that the Tpr knockdown was likely to be partial, and all RNAi experiments, dynein and Tpr, are interpreted with respect to this consideration. Nevertheless, these data suggest that normal metaphase–anaphase transition requires balanced concentrations of dynein, Mad1, and Tpr. Further, we also confirmed these severe chromosome-lagging phenotypes in other two cancer cell lines (MCF7 and HEK293T cells) and less frequently were found in NIH3T3 (normal cells) (supplemental Fig. S7, white arrow). Thus, we have demonstrated that knockdown of Tpr generated aneuploidy-chromosome lagging. Finally, we tested our hypothesis that Tpr spatiotemporally regulates the recruitment of Mad1 and Mad2 to the dynein complex during the metaphase–anaphase transition. In siRNA-mediated Tpr knockdown HeLa cells, we found that Mad1 protein levels were surprisingly decreased by 40%, whereas the amounts of Mad2 and dynein complex proteins were largely unaltered (Fig. 4B). However, localization of Mad1 and Mad2 at the kinetochore was abolished (Fig. 4, F and G). In addition, Tpr depletion caused severe chromosome abnormalities; blended chromosomes (Fig. 4E) and supernumerary spindles (in ∼27% of cells) were found (Fig. 5C and supplemental Fig. S4). We found that 72 h after transfection with siRNA duplexes targeting Tpr, a high proportion (39%) of cells displayed a strikingly altered lagging chromosome morphology compared with controls (Fig. 5C). The extra lagging chromosome appeared to fail to pull chromosomes away from the main spindle, contributing to serious chromosome-alignment defects. Importantly, Tpr siRNA-treated cells abolished the localization of dynein, Mad1, and Mad2 at spindle poles (Fig. 4, E–G, and supplemental Fig. S4). Mad1 interacts with the N-terminal region of Tpr (Fig. 2C) (31.Lee S.H. Sterling H. Burlingame A. McCormick F. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2926-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); therefore, if our hypothesis was correct, overexpression of GFP-Tpr N-terminal region (1–774) would mimic the Tpr siRNA (Mad1 reduction) phenotype through sequestration of endogenous Mad1, and the chromosome abnormalities would reappear. We examined the effect of expressing this domain (Tpr-N) in HeLa cells to challenge our hypothesis further. Consistent with our prediction, chromosome lagging was observed in 30% of these cells (Fig. 5, A and C, and supplemental Fig. S6B). To gather further evidence for this, we carried out transient overexpression of GFP-Mad1 in HeLa cells because enhanced GFP-Mad1 expression should also mimic the Tpr siRNA phenotypes through sequestration of endogenous Tpr, and, again, chromosome abnormalities ought to reappear. Again, we found that chromosome lagging was observed in 30% of GFP-Mad1 mitotic cells (Fig. 5, B and C). In addition, cells showing unequal chromosome segregation were also found (supplemental Fig. S6B, white asterisk). A highly plausible interpretation of these results is that the N-terminal region of Tpr and GFP-Mad1 bind to and sequester endogenous Mad1 and Tpr, respectively. This would disrupt the efficient interaction between Mad1 and Tpr and would be analogous to the RNAi knockdown of Tpr. Our findings suggest that Tpr spatiotemporally regulates the recruitment of spindle checkpoint proteins (e.g. Mad1 and Mad2) to the dynein complex during the metaphase–anaphase transition (Fig. 6) prevent chromosome lagging. Because dynein is a minus end-directed motor, it is responsible for transporting many proteins and/or complexes from kinetochores to centrosomes, where the minus ends of microtubules are anchored (36.Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar, 37.Vale R.D. Cell. 2003; 112: 467-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar, 43.Nguyen C.L. McLaughlin-Drubin M.E. Münger K. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8715-8722Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We and others showed previously that the dynein motor complex positions mitotic spindle poles and is responsible for targeting the NuMA and Rae1 to spindle poles, where Rae1·NuMA subcomplex focuses and stabilizes microtubule ends and tethers them to the centrosomes (19.Wong R.W. Blobel G. Coutavas E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 19783-19787Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 44.Merdes A. Heald R. Samejima K. Earnshaw W.C. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 851-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Dynein is also recruited to kinetochores where it is reported to play a role in spindle assembly checkpoint inactivation by transporting checkpoint proteins away from properly attached kinetochores (34.Howell B.J. McEwen B.F. Canman J.C. Hoffman D.B. Farrar E.M. Rieder C.L. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1159-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 45.Griffis E.R. Stuurman N. Vale R.D. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Overall, our data show that Tpr interacted directly with dynein motor complex during mitosis (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2) and that these interaction are biologically functional and very crucial for proper checkpoint inactivation. Altering either Tpr and dynein concentration produces defects on spindle polarity (Figs. 3C, 4, E–G, and 5C) and chromosome lagging (Figs. 3, C and D, and 4, E–G; supplemental Fig. S5 and supplemental video 2). When Tpr levels are further depleted, many cells display abnormal spindle polarity, bending chromosomes, and chromosome lagging (Fig. 4, E–G, supplemental Fig. S5, and supplemental video 2). These phenotypes could reflect a direct role for Tpr in forming spindle structure. Alternatively, disruption of proper chromosome dynamics during mitosis is known to result in a similar nuclear morphology and indeed has been the basis of a screen for mitotic regulators (20.Mackay D.R. Elgort S.W. Ullman K.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1652-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 47.Draviam V.M. Stegmeier F. Nalepa G. Sowa M.E. Chen J. Liang A. Hannon G.J. Sorger P.K.

We found in live imaging analysis significant chromosome lagging in mitosis under these conditions of Tpr knockdown. Based on the Tpr siRNA results, we performed a series of assays to rescue the chromosome-lagging defects in Tpr knockdown cells to confirm further the functional role of the Tpr-dynein interaction with the mitotic spindle (Fig. 5). This supports a model in which Tpr function impacts progression out of metaphase–anaphase transition and/or chromosome segregation itself, and the miscoordination that follows results in aberrant chromatin morphology (Fig. 6). Most cancers exhibit a complex pattern of chromosomal abnormalities, showing both chromosome gains and/or losses, together with structural aberrations; therefore, we speculate that the spatiotemporal regulation of checkpoint proteins by Tpr·dynein complex is important in the deregulation of growth control found in cancer cells. It is worth noting that the Tpr-Met oncogene, a carcinogen-induced chromosomal rearrangement, resulting in a protein dimerization domain of Tpr fused to the receptor tyrosine kinase domain of Met, has been described (17.Xu S.

Given the data presented here of the chromosome lagging and congressional defects at the metaphase–anaphase transition, it is also reasonable to propose that chromosomal rearrangement of Tpr could lead to chromosomal instability in certain tumors.

https://openalex.org/W2014204123,"Germ line mutations of the ubiquitin ligase cullin 7 (CUL7) are linked to 3-M syndrome and Yakuts short stature syndrome, both of which are characterized by pre- and post-natal growth retardation. CUL7 knock-out mice show placental and embryonic defects similar to intrauterine growth retardation, suggesting a role of CUL7 in placentation. CUL7 was found in this study to be highly expressed in first trimester invasive human placental villi as well as in HTR8/SVneo and B6Tert cells, two cell lines derived from human first trimester trophoblast cells. However, CUL7 levels in term trophoblast cells or JEG-3 cells, which are derived from human choriocarcinoma but exhibit weak invasion capacity, were low or undetectable. Forced expression of CUL7 in JEG-3 cells induced cell morphological changes characteristic of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which was accompanied by a complete loss of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and P-cadherin and a significant elevation of mesenchymal markers Vimentin and N-cadherin. JEG-3 cells expressing CUL7 exhibited enhanced cell migration and invasion. Conversely, CUL7-specific RNA interference in HTR8/SVneo cells resulted in increased E-cadherin expression and reduced cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, CUL7 expression down-regulated E-cadherin mRNA expression by up-regulating ZEB1 and Slug, two transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin. Finally, CUL7-induced loss of E-cadherin expression was partially reversed by treatment of CUL7-expressing cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. These results suggest that the CUL7 E3 ligase is a key regulator in trophoblast cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition and placental development.

These results suggest that the CUL7 E3 ligase is a key regulator in trophoblast cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition and placental development. The cullin family proteins are scaffold proteins for the Ring finger type E3 ligases (1.Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar, 2.Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). Humans express seven cullin proteins: CUL1–3, CUL4A, CUL4B, CUL5, and CUL7 (p185, p193, KIAA0076). Each cullin protein can form an E3 ligase similar to the prototype Ring-type E3 ligase Skp1-CUL1-F-box complex (3.Skaar J.R. Arai T. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5579-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 4.Cardozo T. Pagano M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). The Cullin-RING-finger type E3 ligases are important regulators in early embryonic development, as highlighted by genetic studies demonstrating that knock-out of CUL1, CUL3, or CUL4A in mice results in early embryonic lethality (5.Dealy M.J.

In contrast, CUL7 appears to be an important regulator of placental development. First, CUL7 knock-out in the mouse results in small and abnormal placentas, which are characterized by impaired formation of the spongiotrophoblast layer and vascular defects in the labyrinth layer (8.Arai T.

As a result of the placental defect, CUL7 knock-out mice exhibit smaller fetuses at late gestational stages and neonatal lethality. In support of the placental function of CUL7, mice lacking Fbxw8 (also known as Fbw6 or Fbx29), the only F-box protein identified as a CUL7 binding partner (9.Tsutsumi T. Kuwabara H. Arai T. Xiao Y.

Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 3154-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), exhibit a phenotype almost identical to that of CUL7−/− mice; that is, small embryos but with abnormalities mainly restricted to the placenta (9.Tsutsumi T.

In addition to the genetic evidence in mice, CUL7 mutations have also been identified in 3-M syndrome and the Yakuts short stature syndrome, both of which are characterized by pre- and post-natal growth retardation but with relatively normal mental and endocrine functions, suggesting that CUL7 may also be crucial for human placental development (12.Huber C.

During human placental development, three main trophoblast populations can be identified: cytotrophoblast stem cells, syncytiotrophoblast, and extravillous cytotrophoblast (14.Vićovac L. Aplin J.D. Acta. Anat. 1996; 156: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Villous trophoblast cells undergo terminal differentiation and fusion to form the multinucleated epithelial syncytiotrophoblast, whereas the extravillous cytotrophoblast undergoes an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), 3The abbreviations used are: EMTepithelial-mesenchymal transitionPBSphosphate-buffered salinesiRNAsmall interfering RNAGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseRTreverse transcriptionEVTextravillous trophoblast cellsEVempty vectorPIpropidium iodide. detaches from the distal cell columns, and infiltrates the endomyometrium to anchor the placenta. However, neither the external signals nor the major intracellular signaling pathways responsible for this EMT are known (14.Vićovac L. Aplin J.D. Acta.

Given the clear implication of CUL7 in placental development in both humans and mice, we investigated the possible roles of CUL7 in trophoblast cell differentiation and function. We first examined CUL7 expression in different types of trophoblast cells in human first trimester and term placentas as well as several well established cell models of trophoblast cell lineage. Through RNA interference and overexpression studies, we have demonstrated that CUL7 is a key factor in regulating the EMT of the trophoblast cell lineage. Placental tissue collection was carried out in accordance with guidelines established by the Ethics Committee of the Xuan-Wu Hospital in Beijing. Informed consent was obtained from each woman donating her placenta. Ten normal human placentas at different gestational stages (seven at the first trimester and three at term) were collected from women undergoing legal elective abortion or normal full-term delivery. All placental tissues were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C followed by paraffin embedding. Immunohistochemical studies were performed using the Histostain-Plus kit and diaminobenzidine (Zhongshan Corp., Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, sections (5 μm) were deparaffinized and rehydrated in xylene and a graded series of ethyl alcohol. Antigen retrieval in 10 mm sodium citrate and 10 mm citric acid was performed by microwave irradiation. Tissue sections were then incubated with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 15 min to quench endogenous peroxidase followed by sequential incubation in normal goat serum for 30 min, primary antibodies against CUL7 (10 μg/ml, Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) at 4 °C overnight, and biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 min. The diaminobenzidine solution was applied until a brown color developed. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with histomount (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Negative controls were performed by replacing the primary antibody with control IgG. Semiquantitative determination of CUL7 expression in the various trophoblast cells (Fig. 1A, panel a, inset) was carried out using ImageJ Basics (National Institutes of Health, Version 1.42). At least 270 cells were counted for each cell type with the gray level of intercellular space taken as background. All the experiments performed in this study were in accordance with guidelines established by the Ethics Committee, State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The human extravillous trophoblast cell line HTR8/SVneo and choriocarcinoma cell line JAR were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3 was maintained in F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. B6Tert cells are normal placental-origin cytotrophoblast cells stably transfected with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene, which exhibit characteristics of normal extravillous cytotrophoblasts during the early weeks of gestation. B6Tert cells were cultured in F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% bovine serum albumin, 200 mm l-glutamine, 1 mg/ml insulin, and 1 μg/ml epidermal growth factor. All cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Full-length human CUL7 cDNA in pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector was a generous gift from Dr. Y. Xiong (Depart. of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). JEG-3 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-CUL7 or empty vector (EV) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To establish cell lines stably expressing CUL7 or carrying the empty vectors, cells were trypsinized at 24 h after transfection and selected in medium in the presence of 0.75 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) for 7 days. pcDNA3-CUL7 plasmids encoding full-length or truncated CUL7 mutants consisting of amino acid residues 1–1343 or 268–1698 were kindly provided by Dr. J. DeCaprio (Depart. of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). In brief, JEG-3 cells were seeded onto coverslips in 60-mm dishes. Transfection was carried out when cells reached 50–60% confluence using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) transfection. Four-microgram plasmid DNA/60-mm dish for full-length CUL7, mutant plasmid, or empty vector was used in this study. Cells transfected with pcDNA3-EV served as a negative control. Cells were incubated with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 6 h and then with fresh F-12/ Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. At 48 h after transfection, cells grown on the coverslips were washed briefly with PBS and fixed with ice-cold methanol at −20 °C for 10 min. The coverslips were incubated with indicated primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, washed in PBS, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in PBS with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were washed in PBS and incubated for 5 min at room temperature with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole followed by mounting using 1,4-diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane (DABCO) anti-fade mounting medium. Image acquisition was performed by confocal microscopy using a Carl Zeiss LSM 710 laser-scanning microscope. Stealth small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were designed by Invitrogen. The sequences of siRNAs used are: CUL7, 5′-AUAAUCAGGACUACUCAACAUGUGC-3′; E-cadherin, 5′-AUAAUCAGGACUACUCAACAUGUGC-3′; ZEB1, 5′-AUAAGACCCAGAGUGUGAGAAGCGC-3′; Slug, 5′-UAAUGUGUCCUUGAAGCAACCAGGG-3′. As a nonspecific control, a universal control siRNA was used. siRNA duplex was transfected into cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Final concentrations of siRNAs were 100 nm, and the cells were harvested 72 h after transfection. Total protein extracts were prepared in whole-cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) containing an inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Protein concentrations were determined using a standard Bradford assay, and 50 μg of total protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against human CUL7 (1 μg/ml; Bethyl Laboratories), human Slug (0.25 μg/ml; Abgent, San Diego, CA), human ZEB1 (0.2 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), human E-cadherin (0.2 μg/ml, Santa Cruz), or human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (0.1 μg/ml; Abcam, Cambridge Science Park, UK) followed by incubation in secondary antibodies. Signals were developed using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence system (Pierce). HTR8/SVneo, B6Tert, or JEG-3 cells were lysed and processed for total RNA extraction using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first cDNA strand was synthesized by Superscript reverse transcriptase. The sequences of the primers used for the PCR amplification are shown in Table 1. The cDNA of the housekeeping GAPDH gene was also amplified for normalization.TABLE 1Primers used for RT-PCR experimentsGeneNCBI accession no.Primer sequence (5′–3′)CUL7NM_014780ForwardCCATCTCAGAGTCCCAACACReverseTTCAGCACCACGGCATAGE-cadherinNM_004360ForwardACGCATTGCCACATACAReverseCGTTAGCCTCGTTCTCAVimentinNM_003380ForwardATGGCTCGTCACCTTCGReverseAGTTTCGTTGATAACCTGTCCN-cadherinNM_001792ForwardGAAAGACCCATCCACGReverseCCTGCTCACCACCACTAP-cadherinNM_001793ForwardGGTGGTTCTCCGCAATGReverseGCCGCCTTCAGGTTCTCZEB1NM_030751ForwardAGAAAGCAGGCGAACCReverseTCATCCTCCCAGCAGTSnailNM_005985ForwardAATCGGAAGCCTAACTACAGCGReverseGTCCCAGATGAGCATTGGCASlugAF042001ForwardAGCAGTTGCACTGTGATGCCReverseACACAGCAGCCAGATTCCTCGAPDHM33197ForwardAGCCACATCGCTCAGACAReverseTGGACTCCACGACGTACTTwistNM_000474ForwardCAGCTACGCCTTCTCGGReverseCACGCCCTGTTTCTTTGASIP1NM_014795ForwardAAATGATGAGGTGCTTCCReverseTCAATGATGTAGGGCTTC Open table in a new tab JEG-3, HTR8/SVneo, or JAR cells cultured on coverslips were fixed for 10 min in ice-cold methanol and permeabilized for 7 min with 0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST). After incubation with blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin), cells were incubated with primary antibodies against CUL7 (10 μg/ml, Bethyl Laboratories), E-cadherin (10 μg/ml, Santa Cruz), or Vimentin (10 μg/ml, Santa Cruz). Cells were washed with PBST and incubated with appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (10 μg/ml; Zhongshan Corp). For staining of filamentous actin, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc.) at 3 units/ml dilution. Nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide (PI). Slides were mounted with 1,4-diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane anti-fade mounting medium and analyzed by confocal microscopy using a Carl Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning microscope. Invasion of cells was measured in Matrigel (BD Biosciences)-coated Transwell inserts (6.5 mm, Costar, Cambridge) containing polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pores as detailed previously (16.Fu J.J. Lin P. Lv X.Y. Yan X.J. Wang H.X. Zhu C. Tsang B.K. Yu X.G. Wang H. Placenta. 2009; 30: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The inserts were coated with 50 μl of 1 mg/ml Matrigel matrix according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After transfection with siRNAs for 24 h, HTR8/SVneo cells (2 × 105), B6Tert cells (2.5 × 105), or JEG-3 cells (2.5 × 105) in 200 μl of serum-free medium were plated in the upper chamber, whereas 600 μl of medium with 10% fetal bovine serum were added to the lower well. After incubation for 22 h at 37 °C, non-invaded cells on top of the Transwell were scraped off with a cotton swab. The filters attached with invaded cells on the other side were washed with PBS, fixed in methanol for 10 min, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The invaded cells were counted under a light microscope (Olympus IX51) in 10 randomly selected fields at a magnification of ×200. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Invasion of cells under different treatments was normalized to the control and expressed as the means of invasion percentage (%) ±S.E. Trophoblast migration was carried out using Transwell inserts (6.5 mm, Costar) containing polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pores. Methods used in cell migration assay were similar to Matrigel invasion assay except that the Transwell insert was not coated with Matrigel. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Quantification of the bands from RT-PCR and Western blotting were determined by MetaView Image Analyzing System (Version 4.50; Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Results were presented as the mean ± S.E.

As shown in Fig. 1A, CUL7 expression levels were higher in cytotrophoblast cells (CTB) and the trophoblast column (TC) than those in syncytiotrophoblasts (STB) at first trimester (panel a). Extravillous trophoblast cells (EVT) invading into the maternal decidua at term had a lower level of CUL7 (panel b). Cytokeratin 7 (CK7) is a marker to show positive staining in cytotrophoblast cells and the trophoblast column in first trimester placental villi (panel c) and EVT in term decidua (panel d). Control IgG exhibited no specific staining in either first trimester placental villi (panel e) or term decidua (panel f). Expression of CUL7 in several human trophoblast cell lines was also examined by RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence microscopy. CUL7 mRNA could be detected in HTR8/SVneo, B6Tert, and choriocarcinoma JAR cells but was very low in JEG-3 cells (Fig. 1B). Similarly, CUL7 protein was present in HTR8/SVneo cells and B6Tert cells but was undetectable in JEG-3 cells (Fig. 1C). JAR cells expressed low but detectable levels of CUL7 proteins (Fig. 1C). Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed these findings and further revealed that CUL7 proteins were predominantly present in the cytoplasm of HTR8/SVneo and B6Tert cells (Fig. 1D). We noticed that JEG-3 cells, which lacked CUL7 expression, exhibited cobblestone-like morphology (not shown but similar to JEG-3-EV as in Fig. 2A, middle panel), characteristic of epithelial cells. In contrast, HTR8/ SVneo cells, which expressed CUL7, were of more elongated, fibroblast-like mesenchymal appearance (Fig. 1D). To investigate whether the lack of CUL7 expression in JEG-3 cells contributed to their epithelial cell morphology, we generated JEG-3 cells stably expressing CUL7. Overexpression of CUL7 in JEG-3 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting (Fig. 2A, left panel). JEG-3 cells expressing CUL7 lost the epithelial cell morphology and instead exhibited elongated mesenchymal cell shape (Fig. 2A, right panel)). In contrast, JEG-3 cells harboring the EV maintained the cobblestone-like epithelial morphology (Fig. 2A, middle panel). To confirm that CUL7 expression caused EMT in JEG-3 cells, we examined the expression of both epithelial markers (E-cadherin and P-cadherin) (17.Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5489) Google Scholar) and mesenchymal markers (Vimentin and N-cadherin) (17.Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5489) Google Scholar, 18.Arias A.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 425-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CUL7 in JEG-3 cells resulted in a substantial loss of E-cadherin and P-cadherin as well as a markedly increased expression of Vimentin and N-cadherin (Fig. 2, B and C). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that JEG-3 cells (not shown) and JEG-3 cells transfected with a control vector exhibited E-cadherin staining typical of epithelial cells (Fig. 2D, EV), whereas CUL7 expression in these cells caused a complete loss of E-cadherin in the cell junctions (Fig. 2D, CUL7). Analyzing another epithelial marker, cytokeratin 8/18, revealed a similar result, with prominent expression in JEG-3 cells transfected with EV but an absence in CUL7-expressing JEG-3 cells (Fig. 2D). In contrast, Vimentin was undetectable in vector-transfected JEG-3 cells but was prominently expressed in CUL7-expressing JEG-3 cells (Fig. 2D). The effect of forced expression of CUL7 was also examined in JAR cells, another cell line derived from human choriocarcinoma that exhibits low endogenous CUL7 (Fig. 1, B and C). Significantly, overexpression of CUL7 also diminished E-cadherin expression (Fig. 2, C and E). To explore whether CUL7-mediated EMT in JEG-3 cells required the associated E3 ligase activity, a CUL7 N-terminal-truncated mutant, CUL7 (268–1698), lacking the ability to bind FBXW8 was utilized (8.Arai T. Kasper J.S. Skaar J.R. Ali S.H. Takahashi C. DeCaprio J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2F, transient expression of full-length CUL7 (1–1698) eliminated E-cadherin expression, similar to the results obtained in the stable line (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the FBXW8 binding-deficient mutant, CUL7 (268–1698) was ineffective in inhibiting E-cadherin expression. The two CUL7 constructs were expressed at similar levels in these transient expression experiments (not shown). These results strongly suggest that the ability of CUL7 to bind FBXW8 is necessary for its ability to inhibit E-cadherin expression and to cause EMT in JEG-3 cells. To further confirm the involvement of E3 ligase/proteasome in CUL7-mediated EMT in JEG-3 cells, we treated CUL7-expressing JEG-3 cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. MG-132 significantly restored E-cadherin expression, as indicated by both immunoblotting and RT-PCR (Fig. 3, A and B). As a control, treating JEG-3 cells or JEG-3 cells transfected with EV with the same concentration of MG-132 did not alter E-cadherin expression (Fig. 3, C and D). Furthermore, the proteasome inhibitor partially restored E-cadherin at the cell junctions (Fig. 3E). These results clearly suggested that CUL7-mediated EMT in JEG-3 cells was dependent on its function to activate the E3/proteasome pathway. Epithelial cells undergoing EMT are characterized by increased motility. We, thus, attempted to determine whether overexpression of CUL7 increased cell motility by using the Matrigel invasion assay and Transwell migration assay. Cell motility was markedly increased in JEG-3 cells transfected with CUL7, as compared with control cells, which were transfected with the EV (Fig. 4, A and B). To test the specificity of the effect of CUL7 in this overexpression system, CUL7 siRNA was introduced into JEG-3 cells stably transfected with CUL7. Migration of CUL7-expressing JEG-3 cells was significantly decreased by CUL7 siRNA (Fig. 4C). As expected, transfection of JEG-3 cells with E-cadherin siRNA, but not with a scrambled siRNA (CTL), inhibited E-cadherin expression and increased cell motility (Fig. 4D). In contrast to JEG-3 cells, which lacked CUL7 and exhibited an epithelial cell phenotype, HTR8/SVneo and B6Tert cells expressed CUL7 and exhibited a fibroblast-like phenotype. To determine whether CUL7 expression is necessary for the fibroblast-like phenotype, we transfected HTR8/SVneo cells with siRNA targeted to CUL7. CUL7 siRNA significantly reduced CUL7 expression but did not affect the expression of other cullins tested (Fig. 5D). HTR8/SVneo cells transfected with CUL7 siRNA, but not control siRNA, exhibited a partial phenotypic change such that in some area the cells were clustered and appeared cobblestone-like morphology (Fig. 5A, upper right panel). Furthermore, CUL7 siRNA caused a significant increase in E-cadherin expression and a corresponding decrease in Vimentin expression (Fig. 5, B and C). Furthermore, CUL7 siRNA expression diminished the levels of stress fibers in these cells (Fig. 5C, panels a and b). Consistent with the notion that inhibition of CUL7 expression reduced the fibroblastic nature of HTR8/SVneo cells, the CUL7 siRNA-transfected cells also exhibited significantly decreased cell invasion (Fig. 5E) and migration (Fig. 5F). Similarly, interference with CUL7 expression in B6Tert cells also significantly reduced cell mobility (Fig. 5, G and H), although no significant impact was observed on cell morphology in this case. Our results indicated that CUL7 overexpression in JEG-3 cells eliminated E-cadherin mRNA (Fig. 2B), suggesting that CUL7 E3 ligase might somehow inhibit E-cadherin transcription. To test this notion, we first determined whether CUL7 had any effect on the expression of various transcription factors that are known to repress E-cadherin transcription (17.Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5489) Google Scholar, 19.Kang Y. Massagué J. Cell. 2004; 118: 277-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). We showed that ZEB1 and Slug, but not Snail, Twist, or SIP1, were significantly up-regulated in JEG-3 cells expressing CUL7 (Fig. 6, A and B). To show whether ZEB1 and Slug were necessary for CUL7-mediated E-cadherin down-regulation, ZEB1 or Slug siRNA was introduced into JEG-3 cells overexpressing CUL7. We found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of ZEB1 or Slug significantly attenuated down-regulation of E-cadherin in these cells (Fig. 6, C and D), suggesting that down-regulation of E-cadherin by CUL7 in JEG-3 cells was mediated at least in part by increased expression of ZEB1 and Slug. In line with this observation, we found that the increased expression of E-cadherin in CUL7 siRNA-transfected HTR8/SVneo cells was accompanied by down-regulation of Slug (data not shown). We have presented evidence here in support of a novel function of CUL7 in promoting EMT in trophoblast cell lineage. First, first-trimester trophoblast cell lines HTR8/SVneo and B6Tert expressed a high level of CUL7 and exhibited fibroblast-like morphology, whereas choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells that lacked CUL7 expression exhibited epithelial cell phenotype. Second, forced expression of CUL7 in JEG-3 cells resulted in dramatic cell morphological changes characteristic of EMT, accompanied by a complete loss of three well established epithelial markers, E-cadherin, P-cadherin, and cytokeratin 8/18, and elevation of two mesenchymal markers, Vimentin and N-cadherin. Third, JEG-3 cells expressing CUL7 exhibited increased cell motility, as measured by two different assays (Matrigel cell invasion and Transwell cell migration assays). Fourth, CUL7-specific RNA interference in HTR8/SVneo cells restored E-cadherin expression, decreased Vimentin expression, and diminished stress fibers, which were accompanied by decreased cell motility. EMT of trophoblast cells is critical for human placentation. In the course of human placental development, EMT takes place where a large subpopulation of trophoblast cells escapes from the anchoring columns, and single cells elongate and detach to infiltrate the maternal decidual interstitium and arteries (14.Vićovac L. Aplin J.D. Acta. Anat. 1996; 156: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Aberrant trophoblast invasion leads to trophoblast-associated gestational diseases; aggressive and uncontrolled invasion leads to choriocarcinoma, a highly metastatic cancer (20.Knoeller S. Lim E. Aleta L. Hertwig K. Dudenhausen J.W. Arck P.C. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2003; 50: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas insufficient trophoblast EMT and invasion lead to intrauterine growth restriction or pre-eclampsia (21.Kaufmann P. Black S. Huppertz B. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 22.Zhou Y. Damsky C.H. Chiu K. Roberts J.M. Fisher S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 950-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 23.Palmieri C. Fisher R.A. Sebire N.J. Lindsay I. Smith J.R. McCluggage W.G. Savage P. Seckl M.J. Lancet. 2005; 366: 688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). JEG-3 cells are derived from human choriocarcinoma and are of cytotrophoblast origin (24.Karmakar S. Dhar R. Das C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55297-55307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). JEG-3 cells exhibit epithelial cell morphology and are, therefore, considered trophoblast cells that have undergone an EMT during tumor metastasis and, later, a mesenchymal to epithelial transition after metastatic invasion of maternal tissues (25.Yang J. Weinberg R.A. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 818-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar). In this sense, forced expression of CUL7 in JEG-3 cells may recapitulate cytotrophoblast cell EMT during embryo implantation and placental development. The fact that CUL7 expression alone elicited a complete EMT in JEG-3 cells suggested that CUL7 is a key regulator of EMT in the trophoblast cell lineage. CUL7 is a scaffolding protein in a Skp1-CUL7-F-box-ROC1-like E3 ligase responsible for assembling an E3 complex consisting of Skp1, CUL7, FBXW8, and ROC1 (26.Dias D.C. Dolios G. Wang R. Pan Z.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16601-16606Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It has been established that the N-terminal region of CUL7 binds the E3 substrate recognition subunit, FBXW8 (26.Dias D.C. Dolios G. Wang R. Pan Z.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16601-16606Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and therefore, the N-terminal-truncated mutant, CUL7 (268–1698), should be unable to assemble a functional E3 ligase. The fact that this mutant, unlike full-length CUL7, failed to suppress E-cadherin expression (Fig. 2F) is supportive of the notion that suppression of E-cadherin expression and induction of EMT in JEG-3 cells are dependent on the ability of CUL7 to assemble a Skp1-CUL7-F-box RING E3 complex and the recruitment of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This notion was further supported by the demonstration of a significant recovery of E-cadherin expression after MG-132 treatment of JEG-3-CUL7 cells (Fig. 3). In contrast, the same MG-132 treatment did not affect E-cadherin expression in either JEG-3 cells or JEG-3-EV cells, both of which lacked detectable CUL7 expression. Therefore, the effect of MG-132 described herein appeared to be specific for the CUL7-based E3 ligase/proteasome pathway in so far as E-cadherin expression was concerned. Interestingly, other E3 ligases have also been shown to be able to induce EMT, for example, the Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) E3 ligase, which has been implicated as a key regulator of mammary gland epithelial cell EMT (27.Ozdamar B. Bose R. Barrios-Rodiles M. Wang H.R. Zhang Y. Wrana J.L. Science. 2005; 307: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). In that case, Smurf1 functions downstream of transforming growth factor β in promoting the loss of E-cadherin expression in mammary epithelial cells. It remains to be determined possible upstream regulators of CUL7 in promoting EMT of trophoblast cells, which undoubtedly will help to better understand the mechanism of trophoblast EMT under physiological or pathological conditions. Our data indicated that two transcription repressors of E-cadherin, ZEB1 and Slug, were significantly up-regulated in JEG-3 cells overexpressing CUL7. Moreover, knocking-down ZEB1 or Slug attenuated CUL7-mediated E-cadherin repression. Taken together, these data reveal that CUL7 represses E-cadherin expression at least in part by activating E-cadherin repressors ZEB1 and Slug via a currently unknown mechanism. It remains to be determined how CUL7, an important component of RING E3 ligase, triggers the activation of the two transcriptional factors. One might speculate that it targets some negative regulators upstream of ZEB1 and Slug for degradation. Identification of the potential targets should be the focus of future studies. CUL7 has been previously implicated in cellular transformation (28.Ali S.H. Kasper J.S. Arai T. DeCaprio J.A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2749-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29.Kasper J.S. Kuwabara H. Arai T. Ali S.H. DeCaprio J.A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11685-11692Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that CUL7, as an anti-apoptotic oncogene, cooperates with Myc to promote transformation (30.Kim S.S. Shago M. Kaustov L. Boutros P.C. Clendening J.W. Sheng Y. Trentin G.A. Barsyte-Lovejoy D. Mao D.Y. Kay R. Jurisica I. Arrowsmith C.H. Penn L.Z. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9616-9622Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because CUL7 is overexpressed in human lung cancers and is correlated with poor patient outcome, it is suggested that CUL7 may play an important role in transformation of tumor cells (30.Kim S.S. Shago M. Kaustov L. Boutros P.C. Clendening J.W. Sheng Y. Trentin G.A. Barsyte-Lovejoy D. Mao D.Y. Kay R. Jurisica I. Arrowsmith C.H. Penn L.Z. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9616-9622Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our results suggest another role for CUL7 in promoting EMT in the trophoblast cell lineage. Given the indispensable role of EMT in promoting progression of many carcinomas and the fact that trophoblast invasion shares many similarities with the invasion of tumor cells, our data raise the interesting question of whether CUL7 is also involved in EMT in tumor or other cell types. In summary, our work has revealed a required role for CUL7 in EMT of trophoblast cell lineage and in promoting trophoblast migration and invasion. Our studies also suggest a possible pathological mechanism of CUL7-linked growth retardation syndromes. We thank Drs. X. Johné Liu and Jay Baltz for helpful discussions and language assistance, Dr. Shengping Chen for clinical sample collection, and Dr. J. DeCaprio and Dr. Y. Xiong for kindly providing CUL7 plasmids."

https://openalex.org/W2029356535,"The exocyst is an evolutionarily conserved octameric complex involved in polarized exocytosis from yeast to humans. The Sec3 subunit of the exocyst acts as a spatial landmark for exocytosis through its ability to bind phospholipids and small GTPases. The structure of the N-terminal domain of Sec3 (Sec3N) was determined ab initio and defines a new subclass of pleckstrin homology (PH) domains along with a new family of proteins carrying this domain. Respectively, N- and C-terminal to the PH domain Sec3N presents an additional alpha-helix and two beta-strands that mediate dimerization through domain swapping. The structure identifies residues responsible for phospholipid binding, which when mutated in cells impair the localization of exocyst components at the plasma membrane and lead to defects in exocytosis. Through its ability to bind the small GTPase Cdc42 and phospholipids, the PH domain of Sec3 functions as a coincidence detector at the plasma membrane."

Here we show that AKAP13 (also known as Brx-1, AKAP-Lbc, and proto-Lbc), a unique protein kinase A-anchoring protein (AKAP) guanine nucleotide exchange region belonging to the Dbl family of oncogenes, is essential for cardiac development. Cardiomyocytes of Akap13-null mice had deficient sarcomere formation, and developing hearts were thin-walled and mice died at embryonic day 10.5–11.0. Disruption of Akap13 was accompanied by reduced expression of Mef2C. Consistent with a role of AKAP13 upstream of MEF2C, Akap13 siRNA led to a reduction in Mef2C mRNA, and overexpression of AKAP13 augmented MEF2C-dependent reporter activity.

The targeting vector RMV1-pPNT was constructed by insertion of a 1.6-kb NotI-XhoI fragment into the 5′-arm and a 5.0-kb EcoRI-EcoRI fragment as the 3′-arm of the murine Akap13 gene, replacing a critical exon in the DH domain and 5.39 kb of flanking genomic sequence with the Neor cassette. The targeting vector was sequenced, linearized with HindIII, and electroporated into 129 embryonic stem cells. The targeted event on the 5′-end of the gene was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization of BamHI-digested DNA and hybridization with two 5′-probes (Fig. 1). Targeting of the 3′-region was confirmed using Southern analysis of PCR products (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Additional Southern and PCR analyses substantiated correct recombination events and excluded non-homologous events (not shown). Northern analysis of the multi-tissue mRNA blot using the EcoRI-EcoRI fragment from the 3′-region of the murine Akap13 cDNA was as described (1Rubino D. Driggers P. Arbit D. Kemp L. Miller B. Coso O. Pagliai K. Gray K. Gutkind S. Segars J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A 9.5–10.0 kb band was detected in RNA harvested from heart tissues. Genotypes were analyzed using primers 5′-AAC CCA GTG TGA GCC CAA TAG TC-3′ and 5′-TGC AAA GTA GAG CGG GAA AGA GA-3′ for the wild-type allele and 5′-GGG CGC CCGGTTCTT TTT-3′ and 5′-CTG CCG CGC TTG TTC TCC TCTTCC-3′ for the mutant allele. RT-PCR for Akap13 mRNA in mutant embryos was performed using the Absolutely RNA kit (Stratagene), followed by the Ambion two-step method as per the manufacturer's instructions. The 5′-primer for RT-PCR was 5′-CGG GAG TGT GTT TCT GAA-3′; the 3′-primer was 5′-GGT CCT CCT TTG AGA GCC TC-3′. Embryonic hearts were immediately snap-frozen. Total RNA was isolated using the RLT buffer (RNeasy) isolation method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD). Quantitative PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with duplicates of the 25-μl reaction mixture in Micro Amp optical 96-well reaction plates and sealed with Optical Adhesive Film (Applied Biosystems). Real-time RT-PCR was conducted with oligonucleotide primers for mouse Akap13, Mef2C, and 18 S as follows: Akap13 forward, 5′-TGA GAT TTA CAC AAA GAC AG-3′; Akap13 reverse, 5′-TCA GTG AGT AGA ACT GCT TG-3′; Mef2C forward, 5′-TGG ATG AGC GTA ACA GAC AG-3′; Mef2C reverse, 5′-TGA GCA ACA CCT TAT CCA TG-3′; 18 S forward, 5′-CTT AGA GGG ACA AGT GGC G-3′; 18 S reverse, 5′-ACG CTG AGC CAG TCA GTG TA-3′. Embryos were embedded in paraffin and sectioned in 5-μm slices (Histoserv Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), and TUNEL assays were performed as per the manufacturer's instructions (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Roche Applied Science). Samples treated with DNase I (Worthington Biochemical) were used as a positive control. A peptide corresponding to the murine AKAP-BRX protein (REKEKDKIKEKEKDS KEKEKDK KTLNGHTF) was used to generate polyclonal antiserum 4362 using standard techniques, and binding to BRX was confirmed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (Covance Laboratories, Sterling, VA). Mouse anti-BRX monoclonal antibody (05-759; Millipore, Billerica, MA) was used as indicated. Antibodies to SRF (G-20) and GATA-4 were obtained commercially (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). After fixation and dehydration, embryos were bleached in 3% peroxide with 80% methanol and 20% DMSO for 3 h. Embryos were rehydrated, incubated in phosphate-buffered saline plus 1% Tween 20 (PBST) overnight, and blocked in buffer (5% milk, PBST, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5% DMSO, 0.1% NaN3) twice for 1 h each. Embryos were incubated with primary antibody at a 1:15 dilution in blocking buffer for 2 days with gentle shaking, washed, and incubated in anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Amersham Biosciences) at a 1:200 dilution in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. After washing, embryos were developed with one tablet of DAB Fast (Sigma-Aldrich), washed, and photographed. Genotypes were confirmed by analysis of yolk sacs and tail fragments before staining and/or analysis of the entire embryo after staining and photography. Studies were performed as described (2Miller B.T. Rubino D.M. Driggers P.H. Haddad B. Cisar M. Gray K. Segars J.H. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 2000; 182: 286-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) except as noted. Slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C in primary Ki67 antibodies (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) or 4362 at a dilution of 1:1000–1:3000 in Tris-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin as indicated. Slides were developed using DAB Fast for 10 min and rinsed under a cold tap for 5 min, mounted, and photographed. Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed using digoxygenin-labeled (Roche Applied Science) probes. Antisense probes were prepared from partial mouse cDNAs (Hand1 (nucleotides 769–1792), Nkx2.5 (nucleotides 1023–1593), and murine Akap (nucleotides 1778–1792)) inserted in pBluescript (Stratagene) or pcDNA1 (Invitrogen), followed by linearizing the phagemid and transcription with RNA polymerase. Antisense probes for Gata-4, Mef2C, Tbx2, Anf (atrial naturetic factor), Cx40, and Mlc2a were generously provided by Drs. Christoffels and Moorman (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Embryos were treated with Proteinase K, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then hybridized with probe overnight at 70 °C. After hybridization, embryos were treated with RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min. After blocking, anti-digoxygenin AP was added overnight at 4 °C. Embryos were then incubated in purple AP substrate and photographed. Embryo hearts were dissected, and dispersed cells were cultured in DMEM plus 20% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. All primary cultures were verified to be spontaneously contracting or were stained positively for cardiac myosin (Abcam). After 2–4 days, cells were replated on collagen or fibronectin (FNC coating mix (AthenaES, Baltimore, MD))-coated slides (Labtek II chamber slides, Nalge Nunc International (Naperville, IL)) for confocal studies. Transfection studies were performed as described using expression constructs for Brx and Gα12QL and the c-fos SRE-luciferase reporter (14Driggers P.H. Segars J.H. Rubino D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46792-476797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Following overnight incubation, cells were lysed, lysates were normalized for protein content, and luciferase assays were performed. H9C2 cells derived from embryonic heart tissue were obtained from the American Tissue Type Collection (Manassas, VA). A Mef2c cDNA was amplified from a skeletal muscle cDNA library (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) and subcloned into plasmid pM (Clontech) to generate pM-MEF2C. Cells for transfection were grown on collagen-coated plates. Dissected embryo hearts were placed directly into Teflon baskets, fixed with glutaraldehyde, and prepared for scanning electron microscopy using standard techniques. Grids were examined with a Philips CM10 electron microscope. Primary cardiomyocyte cultures were fixed, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X 100, blocked using 1% bovine serum albumin and 10% normal goat serum, and incubated either with 4362 murine anti-BRX polyclonal antibody or monoclonal anti-BRX (Millipore) at a 1:50 dilution overnight at 4 °C. For secondary antibody, either FITC (anti-rabbit; 1:100) or Alexa-594 (anti-mouse, 1 μg/ml; Invitrogen) was used. DAPI (Sigma) was added at 0.1 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline before the cells were examined with an Axiovert 405M epifluorescence inverted light microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Images were acquired with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu Orca, Shizuoka, Japan). To study filamentous actin, primary cultures of cardiac cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde. Phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) antibody or Alexa 546-phalloidin (Invitrogen) was used per the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse monoclonal antibody (BA-G5) specific for heavy chain cardiac myosin (Abcam) was used at 1:200 to detect cardiac myosin. MEF2C was detected using E-17 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 1:50 overnight at 4 °C. Images were examined as described, and the intensity of staining was quantified using ImageJ analysis (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) of ×64 magnification images. After overnight incubation of H9C2 cells, 0.45 μg of the siRNA for Akap13 or AllStars negative control siRNA (Qiagen) was transfected with x-tremeGENE siRNA (Roche Applied Science). Cells were harvested at 24 h, and RNA was extracted using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The reverse transcription reaction was performed with random hexamers with the TaqMan reverse transcriptase kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The following primer pairs were used: Akap13 forward, 5′-AGG ATC ACC AAG TAC CCA GT-3′; Akap13 reverse, 5′-CAT CTG CCC ACT CTT CAT TC-3′; SRF forward, 5′-GGA GTT CAT CGA CAA CAA GC-3′; SRF reverse, 5′-GTA TAC ACA TGG CCT GTC TC-3′; GATA-4 forward, 5′-TCT CAC TAT GGG CAC AGC AG-3′; GATA-4 reverse, 5′-CGA GCA GGA ATT TGA AGA GG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward, 5′-ATG GTG AAG GTC GGT GTG AA-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reverse, 5′-GGG TAG AGT CAT ACT GGA AC-3′. Reactions were performed in triplicate using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI PRISM 7700 SDS light cycler (Applied Biosystems). The 35S-labeled in vitro transcribed and translated proteins were tested for binding to GST-fused BRX proteins bound to GST-Sepharose beads essentially as described (1Rubino D. Driggers P. Arbit D.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). pEXP-RXRβ and constructs expressing GST-fused full-length BRX or its C-terminal fragment (2.10) have been described (1Rubino D.

Values were compared using an unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test with α = 0.05 or 0.01 and were reported as p values. Tests were performed with SAS (Cary, NC). Following cloning and characterization of the human BRX-1 (1Rubino D. Driggers P. Arbit D. Kemp L. Miller B. Coso O. Pagliai K. Gray K. Gutkind S. Segars J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we cloned the murine cDNA and murine BRX gene (hereafter called Akap13). The mouse Akap13 gene was targeted in embryonic stem cells using homologous recombination, resulting in a deletion of critical residues in the GEF region of Akap13 (Fig. 1, A–D and supplemental Fig. S1, A–C). Mice heterozygous for the null Akap13 allele appeared grossly normal but exhibited impaired glucocorticoid action (15Kino T. Souvatzoglou E. Charmandari E. Ichijo T. Driggers P. Mayers C.

Examination of wild-type and heterozygous embryos using whole mount immunohistochemistry revealed staining for AKAP13 protein in the forebrain, limb bud, first brachial arch, and developing heart (Fig. 2E). Mice heterozygous for the null Akap13 allele, while subfertile, were intercrossed with C57/BL6 mice to yield embryos homozygous for the null Akap13 allele. Amplification of Akap13 transcripts using RT-PCR from embryos with two null Akap13 alleles (−/−) failed to reveal any Akap13 transcripts (Fig. 1D; see also real-time RT-PCR results in Fig. 6A), indicating that either the mutant gene was not transcribed or the mutant mRNA transcript was unstable.FIGURE 6AKAP13 is required for expression of normal levels of MEF2C.

Heterozygous adult mice haploinsufficient for the allele exhibited reduced mRNA and protein (18Kino T. Takatori H. Manoli I. Wang Y. Tiulpakov A. Blackman M.R. Su Y.A. Chrousos G.P. DeCherney A.H. Segars J.H. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra5Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), as expected. Genotypes of embryos from timed pregnancies confirmed that embryos homozygous for the null Akap13 allele were present at the predicted Mendelian frequency before E9.0–10.0; however, after E10.5–11.0, resorbing nidation sites were observed (Table 2). Dissection of Akap13−/− embryos revealed normal development until E8.0–8.5. Mutant −/− embryos at E9.0–9.5 were typically within 2 somite pairs of wild-type embryos (Fig. 2), but by E10, homozygous null embryos appeared developmentally delayed compared with wild-type littermates with reduced size of the forebrain, constriction of the nuchal region, and a hypoplastic first brachial arch (Fig. 2F). For this reason, experiments were performed at E9.0–9.5.TABLE 1Genotypes of 438 newborn mice from 74 heterozygous (+/−) × heterozygous (+/−) matingsGenotype of newborn miceExpected Mendelian ratioObserved ratio (number of pups)%%+/+2536 (n = 157)+/−5064 (n = 281)−/−250 (n = 0) Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Gestational age at time of embryonic loss in 26 heterozygous-heterozygous matingsDays postcoitumNormal embryosResorbed embryosPercent resorbed%E7–7.55400E8–8.57711.3E9.5–10.5301025E12.5+13631.6 Open table in a new tab Importantly, cardiac development of homozygous embryos was abnormal because the hearts became enlarged and developed a pericardial effusion. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections of Akap13-null embryos revealed the developing myocardium to be thinned with reduced trabeculation (Fig. 2, D, K, and L). The arrest of heart development after E9.0–9.5 suggested that Akap13 was required for cardiomyocyte differentiation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed strong staining for AKAP13 in newborn and adult hearts (supplemental Fig. 2). Northern and Western blots indicated that the primary cardiac transcript size was 9.5–10.0 kb (Fig. 1E) and that it encoded a 210-220-kDa protein (supplemental Fig. S2D). Staining of developing hearts from wild-type and heterozygous mice at E9.0–9.5 with an antiserum directed against AKAP13 revealed strong staining in the myocardium (Fig. 2, E and G). The primary ring was visible in hearts of Akap13-null embryos (Fig. 2F, arrowhead); however, chamber development slowed and arrested by E9.5–10.0. As an initial approach to examine the mechanism responsible for arrest of cardiac development, we assessed markers of proliferation and apoptosis. Intensity of staining for the Ki67 proliferation antigen did not differ between wild-type and homozygous null embryos (Fig. 2, I–L). Analysis of embryos at E9.0–9.5 using a TUNEL assay showed no increase in apoptosis in Akap13−/− embryos, consistent with an arrest in development rather than an increase in programmed cell death (Fig. 2, M and N, and supplemental Fig. S3). To further define the mechanism responsible for the failure of heart development, we examined the subcellular localization of AKAP13 in primary cultures of cardiomyocytes from wild-type or Akap13−/− embryos. AKAP13 protein was localized to filaments in cardiac cells of wild-type mice. An identical pattern of staining was observed for both a monoclonal antibody (Fig. 3C) and polyclonal antisera directed against different regions of AKAP13 (Fig. 3A), confirming specificity of detectio"
https://openalex.org/W1967088522,"Hsp33, a molecular chaperone specifically activated by oxidative stress conditions that lead to protein unfolding, protects cells against oxidative protein aggregation. Stress sensing in Hsp33 occurs via its C-terminal redox switch domain, which consists of a zinc center that responds to the presence of oxidants and an adjacent metastable linker region, which responds to unfolding conditions. Here we show that single mutations in the N terminus of Hsp33 are sufficient to either partially (Hsp33-M172S) or completely (Hsp33-Y12E) abolish this post-translational regulation of Hsp33 chaperone function. Both mutations appear to work predominantly via the destabilization of the Hsp33 linker region without affecting zinc coordination, redox sensitivity, or substrate binding of Hsp33. We found that the M172S substitution causes moderate destabilization of the Hsp33 linker region, which seems sufficient to convert the redox-regulated Hsp33 into a temperature-controlled chaperone. The Y12E mutation leads to the constitutive unfolding of the Hsp33 linker region thereby turning Hsp33 into a constitutively active chaperone. These results demonstrate that the redox-controlled unfolding of the Hsp33 linker region plays the central role in the activation process of Hsp33. The zinc center of Hsp33 appears to act as the redox-sensitive toggle that adjusts the thermostability of the linker region to the cell redox status. In vivo studies confirmed that even mild overexpression of the Hsp33-Y12E mutant protein inhibits bacterial growth, providing important evidence that the tight functional regulation of Hsp33 chaperone activity plays a vital role in bacterial survival.

The heat shock protein Hsp33 is a highly conserved molecular chaperone, which appears to act by specifically protecting bacteria against oxidative stress conditions that cause protein unfolding (1Ilbert M.

These stress conditions are the result of either very fast-acting oxidants, like hypochlorous acid (i.e. bleach), which directly unfold proteins or the combined action of kinetically slow, non-denaturing oxidants, such as H2O2, with protein unfolding conditions (i.e. oxidative heat shock) (1Ilbert M.

Cell. 2008; 135: 691-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In both cases, widespread protein aggregation occurs in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, under these specific stress conditions, ATP-dependent chaperone foldases, such as the DnaK system, seem unable to effectively prevent protein aggregation, presumably because of the oxidative stress-mediated drop in cellular ATP levels (2Winter J. Linke K. Jatzek A. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Barrette Jr., W.C. Hannum D.M. Wheeler W.D. Hurst J.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9172-9178Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Specific activation of the ATP-independent chaperone holdase Hsp33 appears, therefore, to serve as a compensatory mechanism to minimize protein aggregation and to increase bacterial stress resistance. The mechanistic features that allow Hsp33 to sense oxidizing stress conditions that lead to the protein unfolding center around a C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (Fig. 1A, yellow), which harbors four absolutely conserved cysteines arranged in a Cys232-X-Cys234—X—Cys265-X-X-Cys268 motif. Under reducing, non-stress conditions, all four cysteines are engaged in the tetrahedral coordination of one Zn2+ ion (Fig. 1A, red sphere), whose high affinity binding provides significant stability to the Hsp33 C terminus (6Graf P.C. Martinez-Yamout M. VanHaerents S. Lilie H. Dyson H.J. Jakob U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20529-20538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The zinc binding domain connects to the Hsp33 N-terminal domain (Fig. 1A, blue) via a highly flexible ∼52-amino acid linker region (Fig. 1A, green). In the crystal structure of reduced, inactive Hsp33, the linker region is compactly folded and makes extensive contacts with a largely hydrophobic, four-stranded β-sheet platform of the Hsp33 N-terminal domain (7Janda I. Devedjiev Y. Derewenda U. Dauter Z. Bielnicki J. Cooper D.R. Graf P.C. Joachimiak A. Jakob U. Derewenda Z.S. Structure. 2004; 12: 1901-1907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). Activation of the Hsp33 chaperone function is triggered by intramolecular disulfide bond formation, which leads to the unfolding of the Hsp33 zinc binding domain and unfolding of the linker region. The latter has been shown to lead to the exposure of hydrophobic surface areas, the proposed binding sites of Hsp33 for unfolded proteins (supplemental Fig. S1 and Refs. 8Graf P.C. Jakob U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1624-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Vijayalakshmi J. Mukhergee M.K. Graumann J. Jakob U.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggested a mechanistic model for the activation of Hsp33 in which unfolding of the linker region simultaneously depends on and controls disulfide bond formation (4Winter J. Ilbert M. Graf P.C. Ozcelik D. Jakob U. Cell. 2008; 135: 691-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In this model, incubation of Hsp33 with H2O2 leads to rapid formation of the Cys265–Cys268 disulfide bond, zinc release, and unfolding of the zinc binding domain. This unfolding appears to destabilize the adjacent linker region, which is now in a dynamic equilibrium between a folded state in which the second pair of active site cysteines is not accessible for oxidation and an unfolded state in which the critical second disulfide bond between Cys232 and Cys234 can be formed (11Leichert L.I. Gehrke F. Gudiseva H.V. Blackwell T. Ilbert M. Walker A.K. Strahler J.R. Andrews P.C. Jakob U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8197-8202Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Kinetically slow oxidants, such as H2O2, induce the formation of the second disulfide bond only in the presence of additional unfolding conditions, which shift the equilibrium to the unfolded conformation. Kinetically fast oxidants, such as HOCl, rapidly form the second disulfide bond. Once the second disulfide bond is formed, the linker region appears to remain in an unfolded conformation, and two oxidized monomers associate to form the highly active Hsp33 dimer (4Winter J. Ilbert M. Graf P.C. Ozcelik D. Jakob U. Cell. 2008; 135: 691-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The activation model of Hsp33 implies that the N-terminal hydrophobic platform serves a dual role: as interaction site for the linker region under non-stress conditions and as a binding site for unfolded substrate proteins under stress conditions. We decided to test this model by individually replacing distinct conserved hydrophobic amino acids in the N-terminal domain of Hsp33 with polar (M172S) or charged (Y12E) amino acids, thereby substantially altering the hydrophobic character of this interaction site. Surprisingly, we found that neither of the mutations affected the apparent affinity of Hsp33 for substrate proteins or its ability to sense oxidants. In contrast, the single mutations dramatically altered the regulation of Hsp33, converting the protein into a temperature-regulated (Hsp33-M172S) or constitutively active (Hsp33-Y12E) chaperone, respectively. Circular dichroism (CD) measurements revealed a close correlation between the thermostability of the linker region and the functional regulation of the mutant proteins, providing experimental evidence that unfolding of the linker region is indeed the crucial event in the Hsp33 activation process. The zinc center in Hsp33 appears to act as the switch, which adjusts the thermostability of the linker region according to the oxidation status of the cell. This control mechanism seems to be critical for the Hsp33 in vivo function because expression of the constitutively active Hsp33-Y12E mutant is deleterious to Escherichia coli growth. The Hsp33-M172S and Hsp33-Y12E mutants were generated by introducing single site mutations into the wild-type Hsp33 gene (hslO) using pUJ30 (pET11a-hslO) (3Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.

Cultivation of the Hsp33-overexpressing strains for protein purification was conducted as previously described (12Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.

For the induction of the Hsp33-M172S mutant, the protocol for wild-type Hsp33 was followed (3Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). To overexpress large amounts of soluble Hsp33-Y12E protein, cells were grown to an A600 of 0.6–0.8 at 37 °C and then shifted to 18 °C. Once the temperature was reached, Hsp33-Y12E expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) 4The abbreviations used are: IPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosideAMS4-acetamido-4-maleimidyl-stilbene-2′-disulfonateMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidDTTdithiothreitolbis-ANS3,3′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acidCScitrate synthase. for 24 h. Afterward, the standard protocol for the Hsp33 purification was followed (12Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U.

Reduced, zinc reconstituted Hsp33red was prepared as previously described (12Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U.

To prepare oxidized Hsp33, 50 μm Hsp33red was incubated in 2 mm H2O2 at either 30 °C (Hsp33ox30 °C) or 43 °C (Hsp33ox43 °C) for 3 h. Oxidants were removed using NAP-5 columns. isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside 4-acetamido-4-maleimidyl-stilbene-2′-disulfonate 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid dithiothreitol 3,3′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid citrate synthase. The chaperone activity of wild-type Hsp33 and its variants was measured as previously described (13Beissinger M. Buchner J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 245-259PubMed Google Scholar). In short, 12 μm citrate synthase (CS, Roche) was denatured with 4.5 m Gdn-HCl in 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5) overnight at room temperature. To initiate protein aggregation, denatured CS was diluted to a final concentration of 75 nm in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5 at 30 °C under continuous stirring in the absence or presence of a 4× molar excess of wild-type Hsp33 or Hsp33 variants. To assess the activity of reduced wild-type Hsp33 and the variants at heat shock temperatures, CS (final concentration 150 nm) was incubated in the absence or presence of a 4× molar excess of Hsp33 in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5 at 43 °C. Light scattering was monitored at λex/λem at 360 nm using a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature-controlled cuvette holder and stirrer. To determine changes in the secondary structure of wild-type Hsp33 and its variants, far-UV CD spectra were recorded in 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5 at 20 °C using a Jasco-J810 spectropolarimeter as previously described (6Graf P.C.

To determine the thermostability of Hsp33 and its derivates, the CD signal at either 195 nm or 222 nm was recorded at temperatures from 20 to 50 °C or 20 to 80 °C, respectively. The temperature was increased at a rate of 1 °C per minute. The temperature was controlled with a Jasco Peltier device. The fluorescence probe bis-ANS (Molecular Probes) was used to test for the presence of hydrophobic surfaces in wild-type Hsp33 and the variants as previously described (6Graf P.C. Martinez-Yamout M. VanHaerents S. Lilie H. Dyson H.J. Jakob U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20529-20538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To assess whether oxidation of Hsp33 occurred during the chaperone activity assay, thiol trapping with the 490-Da thiol-reactive probe AMS was performed immediately after the activity measurement (3Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). An aliquot (815 μl) of the activity assay mixture was supplemented with 100% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid and incubated on ice for 30 min. The solution was centrifuged (30 min, 16,000 × g, 4 °C), and the protein pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of AMS-DAB solution (15 mm AMS, 6 m urea, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 50 mm EDTA, 7.5% w/v SDS). After a 1-h incubation in the dark with shaking (1,300 rpm), 5 μl of 5× non-reducing Laemmli buffer was added, and the sample was loaded onto a non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were visualized by Western blot or Coomassie Blue staining of the gels. Overnight cultures of strains expressing either wild-type Hsp33 (UJ83), the two Hsp33 variants (CC4, JHa21), or no protein (CC20) from a pET11a vector in MOPS minimal medium (10× MOPS modified buffer (TEKnovo), 0.2 (w/v) glucose, 132 mm K2HPO4 pH 7, 20 μm thiamine) were prepared. Cell cultures were diluted 1:100 into MOPS minimal medium, supplemented with 50 μm IPTG, and cultivated at 37 °C. Growth was monitored every hour with absorbance measurements at A600. To compare soluble and insoluble proteins in these strains, 5 ml of the culture were removed, and cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) after 5.5 h of cultivation. Cells were resuspended in 650 μl of sucrose buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 25% w/v sucrose, 1 mm NaEDTA, 10 mm DTT) and homogenized by sonication (Kontes, Micro Ultrasonic cell disrupter, 2 × 10–15 s with the output control set to 70). 5 μl of lysozyme (50 mg/ml), 12.5 μl of DNase l (2 mg/ml), and 2.5 μl of MgCl2 (0.5 m) were added, followed by the addition of 650 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% sodium azide, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm DTT). Samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min, frozen at −80 °C for 20 min, and thawed at 37 °C for 15 min. Then, 2.5 μl of MgCl2 (0.5 m) were added, and the solution was incubated at room temperature until the viscosity decreased. NaEDTA was added, and the lysate was centrifuged (11,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of washing buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaEDTA, 1 mm DTT). The solution was again homogenized by sonication as before. Protein aggregates were pelleted by centrifugation (11,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of washing buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaEDTA, 1 mm DTT), and again homogenized by sonication. The washing steps were repeated three times. The final pellet was resuspended in 2× reducing Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min. Aggregate formation was visualized by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining of the gels. The homology modeling of reduced E. coli Hsp33 was performed using the MODELLER software through an interface of the MODWEB modeling server. The crystal structure of reduced Bacillus subtilis Hsp33 (PDB code:1VZY) was used as a template (7Janda I. Devedjiev Y. Derewenda U. Dauter Z. Bielnicki J. Cooper D.R. Graf P.C. Joachimiak A. Jakob U. Derewenda Z.S. Structure. 2004; 12: 1901-1907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The E. coli Hsp33 sequence was aligned to the B. subtilis Hsp33 structure revealing a sequence identity of 24%. To validate the model, the highly conserved core domain of Hsp33 (residues 7–178) was aligned (RMSD = 0.3 Å). A connectivity map was derived using the AQUAPROT server, which calculates interatomic interactions between residues in two chains (14Reichmann D. Phillip Y. Carmi A. Schreiber G. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1051-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For this purpose, the E. coli Hsp33 sequence was divided into N-terminal (amino acids 7–178) and C-terminal (amino acids 179–288) domains. The results were confirmed by a standalone version of the same algorithm, which computes interactions within one chain. The definition of interactions between residues was based on the “all-atom contact” method (15Reichmann D. Cohen M. Abramovich R. Dym O. Lim D. Strynadka N.C. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 663-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), calculating the detailed atomic contacts including hydrogen bonds, van der Waals, aromatic and electrostatic interactions (15Reichmann D. Cohen M. Abramovich R. Dym O. Lim D. Strynadka N.C. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 663-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The van der Waals interactions also reflect side chain packing between protein residues. The residue interaction network was plotted using the Cytoscape V2.6.3 program (16Shannon P. Markiel A.

The surface of the Hsp33 N-terminal β-sheet, which is masked by the folded linker in the crystal structure of reduced, inactive Hsp33 (Fig. 1A), has been postulated to serve as a substrate binding site for unfolded proteins when Hsp33 is oxidized and active (8Graf P.C. Jakob U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1624-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Vijayalakshmi J. Mukhergee M.K. Graumann J. Jakob U.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Hsp33 x-ray structure reveals a cluster of highly conserved hydrophobic amino acids whose side chains face toward the linker region under reducing conditions and might interact with unfolded substrate proteins under oxidizing conditions. We focused on two conserved residues that mapped to the hydrophobic platform, Tyr12 on β-strand 1 and Met172 on β-strand 9 (Fig. 1B, supplemental Fig. S1). We predicted that alteration of these residues would affect the surface features of the four-stranded β-sheet but not the stability or fold of the Hsp33 N-terminal domain. To efficiently disrupt potential hydrophobic interactions, we individually replaced Tyr12 with glutamate (Hsp33-Y12E) or Met172 with the polar residue serine (Hsp33-M172S). We then overexpressed both mutant proteins in BL21 strains lacking the endogenous Hsp33 gene and determined their solubilities. Hsp33-M172S was fully soluble upon IPTG-induced overexpression at 37 °C. In contrast, the Hsp33-Y12E variant was overexpressed but largely insoluble under these conditions. A 24-h induction with IPTG at 18 °C was required to accumulate significant amounts of soluble Hsp33-Y12E. We purified the two variants according to the wild-type Hsp33 protocol and prepared fully reduced, zinc-reconstituted proteins (Hsp33-Y12Ered, Hsp33-M172Sred) for subsequent functional studies. Hsp33 activation by fast-acting oxidants such as HOCl occurs within the mixing time of the experiment, making evaluation of activation kinetics and determination of oxidation intermediates technically challenging. In contrast, H2O2-mediated activation of Hsp33 is significantly slower (t½ of ∼20 min) and depends on the additional presence of unfolding conditions (43 °C) (Fig. 2A, open circles). In the absence of unfolding conditions (H2O2, 30 °C), an oxidation intermediate accumulates, which appears to lack the second disulfide bond (11Leichert L.I. Gehrke F. Gudiseva H.V. Blackwell T. Ilbert M. Walker A.K. Strahler J.R. Andrews P.C. Jakob U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8197-8202Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and is inactive as a chaperone (Fig. 2A, inset). To determine how the introduced mutations affect the redox regulation and chaperone function of our Hsp33 variants, we monitored their activity upon incubation in 2 mm H2O2 at either 30 or 43 °C. As shown in Fig. 2A, both variants displayed chaperone activity very similar to that of activated wild-type Hsp33 when incubated with H2O2 at 43 °C for 2 h. All three oxidized variants suppressed the aggregation of chemically denatured CS to the same extent. These results clearly indicate that the introduced mutations did not substantially affect the substrate binding affinity of Hsp33. Similar results were observed when the activity of the proteins was tested using thermally unfolding malate dehydrogenase as an in vitro chaperone substrate (supplemental Fig. S2A). In contrast to the chaperone function, which seems unchanged, the regulation of Hsp33 chaperone function appears to be dramatically affected by the mutations. Activation of Hsp33-M172S was significantly faster at 43 °C and lacked the lag phase characteristic of wild-type Hsp33 (Fig. 2A, compare Hsp33-M172S, closed squares and wild-type Hsp33, open circles). This lag phase has been shown to correlate to the formation of the critical second disulfide bond in Hsp33 and is thought to represent the rate-limiting step in its activation (11Leichert L.I. Gehrke F. Gudiseva H.V. Blackwell T. Ilbert M. Walker A.K. Strahler J.R. Andrews P.C. Jakob U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8197-8202Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of Hsp33-M172S no longer required the simultaneous presence of oxidizing and unfolding conditions. Incubation of Hsp33-M172S in 2 mm H2O2 at 30 °C was fully sufficient for its activation (Fig. 2A, inset, closed squares) whereas wild-type Hsp33 (Fig. 2A, inset, open circles) remained inactive. Likewise, simple incubation of reduced, zinc-reconstituted Hsp33-M172S at elevated temperatures (43 °C) caused activation of its chaperone function (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the oxidative activation of Hsp33, however, which is irreversible unless reducing agents are added, thermal activation of Hsp33-M172S was fully reversible and required the activity tests to be performed at 43 °C (Fig. 2B). Whereas Hsp33-M172S maintained at least some requirement for post-translational regulation, the freshly reduced and zinc-reconstituted Hsp33-Y12E mutant appeared to be fully active even without incubation in H2O2 or exposure to elevated temperatures (Fig. 2, A and B). Additional exposure to H2O2 at either 30 or 43 °C did not further increase its chaperone activity, suggesting that Hsp33-Y12E is constitutively active (Fig. 2A, open squares). To exclude the possibility that high oxidation sensitivity of the active site cysteines in the two Hsp33 variants leads to their uncontrolled oxidation and subsequent activation during the chaperone assays, we performed thiol trapping experiments on the reduced proteins immediately after the activity assays to assess their cysteine oxidation status (Fig. 2B). We made use of the 490-Da thiol-alkylating reagent AMS, which irreversibly reacts with reduced cysteines and causes a distinct mass increase that is easily discernable on SDS-PAGE. We found that the cysteines in both mutant proteins are reduced and remain reduced even during incubation at 43 °C. This result agrees well with zinc binding studies, which revealed that both mutant proteins remain fully zinc-reconstituted even in the presence of a 20-fold excess of the zinc chelator PAR (Kα = 2 × 1012 m−1 at pH 7) (17Zhou Z.S. Peariso K. Penner-Hahn J.E. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15915-15926Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2B). To test the oligomerization status of the reduced Hsp33 variants, we performed analytical ultracentrifugation and confirmed that both variants are monomeric, as is reduced wild-type Hsp33 (data not shown) (12Graumann J.

These results are in contrast to previous studies, which suggested that dimerization of Hsp33 is required for the full activation of its chaperone function (6Graf P.C. Martinez-Yamout M.

Some of these conclusions were based on a single Hsp33 mutation designed to render Hsp33 constitutively monomeric (Hsp33-E150R) (6Graf P.C. Martinez-Yamout M. VanHaerents S. Lilie H. Dyson H.J. Jakob U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20529-20538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our results with the Hsp33-Y12E mutant suggest that Hsp33 does not require dimerization for its chaperone function in vitro. It is therefore conceivable that the E150R mutation not only interferes with Hsp33 dimerization but, more importantly, with substrate binding. This possibility remains to be investigated. Nevertheless, we conclude from our results that single amino acid mutations at the linker binding interface of the Hsp33 N terminus are sufficient to generate Hsp33 variants that function as highly effective chaperone holdases despite their reduced, zinc-reconstituted, and monomeric conformation. Our results indicated that mutations designed to alter the hydrophobic character of the N-terminal β-sheet platform affect the redox regulation but not the chaperone function of Hsp33. To assess whether the mutations actually caused a detectable change in hydrophobicity, particularly in those surfaces that specifically become exposed upon Hsp33 activation, we recorded the fluorescence spectra of reduced and oxidized wild-type and mutant Hsp33 proteins using the hydrophobic probe bis-ANS. As previously shown, wild-type Hsp33 undergoes substantial conformational rearrangements upon oxidative activation, which lead to the exposure of extensive hydrophobic surfaces that interact with bis-ANS (10"

https://openalex.org/W2029435671,"By targeting redox-sensitive amino acids in signaling proteins, the NADPH oxidase (Nox) family of enzymes link reactive oxygen species to physiological processes. We previously analyzed the sequences of 107 Nox enzymes and identified conserved regions that are predicted to have important functions in Nox structure or activation. One such region is the cytosolic B-loop, which in Nox1-4 contains a conserved polybasic region. Previous studies of Nox2 showed that certain basic residues in the B-loop are important for activity and translocation of p47(phox)/p67(phox), suggesting this region participates in subunit assembly. However, conservation of this region in Nox4, which does not require p47(phox)/p67(phox), suggested an additional role for the B-loop in Nox function. Here, we show by mutation of Nox4 B-loop residues that this region is important for Nox4 activity. Fluorescence polarization detected binding between Nox4 B-loop peptide and dehydrogenase domain (K(d) = 58 +/- 12 nm). This interaction was weakened with Nox4 R96E B-loop corresponding to a mutation that also markedly decreases the activity of holo-Nox4. Truncations of the dehydrogenase domain localize the B-loop-binding site to the N-terminal half of the NADPH-binding subdomain. Similarly, the Nox2 B-loop bound to the Nox2 dehydrogenase domain, and both the Nox2 and Nox4 interactions were dependent on the polybasic region of the B-loop. These data indicate that the B-loop is critical for Nox4 function; we propose that the B-loop, by binding to the dehydrogenase domain, provides the interface between the transmembrane and dehydrogenase domains of Nox enzymes."

In this regard, whereas fumarate activates NAD-ME1 and CoA activates NAD-ME2, both compounds act synergistically on NAD-MEH activity. The characterization of two chimeric enzymes between NAD-ME1 and -2 allowed specific domains of the primary structure, which are involved in the differential allosteric regulation, to be identified. NAD-ME1 and -2 subunits showed a distinct pattern of accumulation in the separate components of the floral organ. In sepals, the NAD-ME1 subunit is present at a slightly higher proportion than the NAD-ME2 subunit, and thus, NAD-MEH and NAD-ME1 act in concert in this tissue. On the other hand, NAD-ME2 is the only isoform present in anthers. In view of the different properties of NAD-ME1, -2, and -H, we suggest that mitochondrial NAD-ME activity may be regulated by varying native association in vivo, rendering enzymatic entities with distinct allosteric regulation to fulfill specific roles. The presence of three different NAD-ME entities, which originate by alternative associations of two subunits, is suggested to be a novel phenomenon unique to plant mitochondria. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains two genes encoding the mitochondrial NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME), NAD-ME1 (At2g13560) and NAD-ME2 (At4g00570). The characterization of recombinant NAD-ME1 and -2 indicated that both enzymes assemble as active homodimers; however, a heterodimeric enzyme (NAD-MEH) can also be detected by electrophoretic studies.

MEs can be classified in three different groups. The first group includes NADP-MEs (NADP-ME, EC 1.1.1.40), which are widely distributed in animals, plants, and microorganisms; this type uses NADP as cofactor and can decarboxylate oxaloacetate (OAA). The second group (NAD-ME, EC 1.1.1.38) is composed of enzymes found in Ascaris suum and bacteria, which use NAD and can decarboxylate OAA in addition to malate. Third category is plant NAD-MEs, which are not able to decarboxylate OAA (NAD-ME, EC 1.1.1.39). malic enzyme NAD-dependent ME fructose 1,6-biphosphate phosphoenolpyruvate oxaloacetate 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid tricarboxylic acid coenzyme A. MEs are widely distributed in nature, and the products of their reaction participate in many biosynthetic pathways and in respiratory metabolism. In plants NADP-MEs are localized to both plastids and cytosol (1Drincovich M.F. Casati P. Andreo C.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 2Gerrard Wheeler M.C.

Apart from being involved in C4-photosynthesis and Crassulacean acid metabolism, non-photosynthetic roles have been proposed for NADP- and NAD-ME, including plant defense responses (4Casati P.

The tetramer is the most common form, but higher and lower structural conformations have also been reported (2Gerrard Wheeler M.C. Tronconi M.A. Drincovich M.F. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Maurino V.G.

On the other hand, plant mitochondrial NAD-MEs are composed of two dissimilar subunits (α and β) at a 1:1 molar radio (17Willeford K.O. Wedding R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8423-8429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the source of the enzyme, pH, and l-malate concentration, plant NAD-MEs assemble as heterodimers, heterotetramers, or heterooctamers (17Willeford K.O. Wedding R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8423-8429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Grover S.D. Wedding R.T. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 1169-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Long J.J. Wang J.L. Berry J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2827-2833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, NAD-MEs purified from some C4 plants, e.g. Eleusine coracana, Panicum dichotomiflorum, and Amaranthus tricolor, are octamers composed of identical subunits (20Murata T. Ohsugi R. Matsuoka M. Nakamoto H. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis thaliana, two genes encoding NAD-MEs, At2g13560 (NAD-ME1) and At4g00570 (NAD-ME2), show expression in all mature organs (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The products of both genes, NAD-ME1 and NAD-ME2, share about 65% sequence identity and are immunological different (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recombinant NAD-ME1 and -2 are active homodimers with similar kinetic parameters (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis insertion mutants defective in each NAD-ME gene exhibit residual NAD-ME activity, indicating that NAD-ME1 and -2 are functional as homodimers in vivo (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, electrophoretic studies revealed that NAD-ME1 and -2 can also associate to form a heterodimeric enzyme both in vivo and in vitro (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Previous kinetic analyses of plant NAD-ME have been limited to enzymes that were purified from plant tissues, where the α and β subunits always co-purified (17Willeford K.O. Wedding R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8423-8429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Grover S.D. Wedding R.T. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 1169-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Long J.J. Wang J.L. Berry J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2827-2833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, the available resources and characteristics of Arabidopsis as a model plant organism allow us to achieve a more complete understanding of the different properties of the separated NAD-ME oligomers. Here, we present the first biochemical characterization of a plant heteromeric NAD-ME (NAD-MEH) obtained by the recombinant technology and a co-expression-based approach. The metabolic regulation of the purified NAD-MEH was investigated and compared with that obtained with the isolated NAD-ME1 and -2 homodimers. In addition, the analysis of chimeric proteins between NAD-ME1 and -2 allowed assignment of the differential regulatory properties to specific regions of the primary structure. Finally, differential relative protein accumulation patterns suggest that NAD-ME activity may also be modulated by alternative associations of the subunits in some organs of Arabidopsis. For the co-expression of NAD-ME1 and -2, the cDNA fragment corresponding to the mature NAD-ME2 (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was cloned in the pET29a vector using the BamHI and SalI sites. The pET29-NAD-ME2 construction expresses the mature NAD-ME2 without any fusion vector-coded sequence because the cloned cDNA has a stop codon in their 5′ end. BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells were simultaneously transformed with pET29-NAD-ME2 and pET32-NAD-ME1, which expresses NAD-ME1 as a His-tag fusion protein (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The cells containing both vectors were selected on LB-agar plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (pET32 selection agent) and 30 μg/ml kanamycin (pET29 selection agent). The co-transformed cells were grown in LB medium until the culture reached an A600 of 0.6. The inductor lactose (1% w/v) was added, and the cells were cultured for a further 16 h at 16 °C. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm imidazole, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated, and centrifuged for 10 min at 7000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column previously equilibrated with Buffer A. The co-expressed proteins were eluted with Buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole. Purified NAD-MEH was treated with enterokinase to remove the His tag fusion in NAD-ME1 and stored as previously described for the separated recombinant proteins (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of NAD-ME1 and NAD-ME2 fusion proteins by pET32-NAD-ME1 and pET32-NAD-ME2 vectors were performed as previously described (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal sequences encoded for by the expression vectors were removed using enterokinase, and the mature proteins were stored as previously described (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The typical protein yield of NAD-ME1 or -2 was nearly 1.5 mg/200 ml of bacterial culture. For NAD-MEH, the typical protein yield was lower, nearly 0.5 mg/200 ml of bacterial culture. For the generation of NAD-ME chimeric protein NAD-ME1q, a PCR reaction was conducted using as template the NAD-ME2 full-length cDNA and the following primer pairs: NAD-ME2F (5′-GGATCCTGCATCGTCCACAAGCGT-3′) and NAD-ME2PstI-HindIII (5′-CTGCAGCAGCGACATACATGACAAGCTTTCCAA-3′). The cloned product was treated with the restriction enzymes BamHI and HindIII, and the purified fragment was ligated to the fragment pET32-NAD-ME1 treated with the same endonucleases (Fig. 4B). For the generation of the chimeric protein NAD-ME2q, the amplification product obtained as indicated above was treated with the restriction enzymes BamHI and PstI, and the purified fragment was ligated to the fragment pET29-NAD-ME2 treated with the same endonucleases. The ligation product obtained has a cDNA of NAD-ME2 with a HindIII site at the position 530, not present in NAD-ME2 sequence. This construction was treated with HindIII and SalI, and the fragment obtained was purified and ligated to the vector pET32-NAD-ME1 digested with HindIII and SalI (Fig. 4B). The inserts of the chimeric constructs (pET32-NAD-ME1q and pET32-NAD-ME2q) were sequenced to verify correct swapping of the corresponding fragments and assume that no mistakes were introduced during the subcloning procedures. BL21(DE3) E. coli was transformed with the pET32 plasmid containing the chimeric NAD-MEs. The induction and purification of NAD-ME1q and NAD-ME-2q were performed as previously described (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal sequences encoded by the expression vectors were removed using enterokinase, and the mature proteins were stored as previously described (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of NAD-MEH was evaluated by gel filtration chromatography on a fast protein liquid chromatography system using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, or with 50 mm Mes-NaOH, pH 6.5, and calibrated using molecular mass standards. The sample, and the standards were applied separately in a final volume of 50 μl at a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The enzymatic activity was determined spectrophotometrically using a standard reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 6.4 or 6.6 depending on the enzyme), 10 mm MnCl2, 4 mm NAD, and 10 mml-malate in a final volume of 0.5 ml. The reaction was started by the addition of l-malate. Initial velocity studies were performed by varying the concentration of one of the substrates around its Km value while keeping the other substrate concentration at saturating levels. All kinetic parameters were calculated at least in triplicate using free concentrations of all substrates (21Detarsio E. Andreo C.S. Drincovich M.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation. In the case of sigmoidal kinetics, initial rates were fitted to the Hill equation by nonlinear regression. When testing different compounds as possible inhibitors or activators of the enzymatic activity, NAD-ME activity was measured in the presence of 0.5 or 2 mm concentrations of each effector and non-saturating concentrations of malate (Km l-malate value of each enzyme, Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic properties of recombinant Arabidopsis NAD-ME1, -2, and -HpH optimumkcatKm NADkcat/Km NADKm l-malatekcat/Km l-malates−1mmmmNAD-ME1aValues previously obtained (12) are included for comparison.6.431.10.5060.23.0bS0.5; the calculated Hill coefficient (nH) is indicated in parentheses.

Open table in a new tab The apparent activation constant (A50) values were obtained by varying the concentration of activator while keeping the NAD concentrations at saturating levels and the l-malate at non-saturating concentrations. Data were fitted, by nonlinear regression to Equation 1, V=V0+Va×AA50+A(Eq. 1) where v0 is the rate in absence of activator; Va is the maximum activated rate, A is the concentration of activator, and A50 is the concentration of activator that gives the 50% Va. In the case of the activation by CoA for NAD-ME2 and NAD-MEH, the studies involved varying of concentration of a substrate while keeping the other substrate concentration fixed and at saturating levels and with varying concentrations of CoA. For NAD-ME2, the resulting data were fitted to Equation 2, V=Vmax×((1+ΦA/KA')(1+A/KA'))×SKm×((1+A/KA)(1+A/KA'))+S(Eq. 2) where V is the activity measured at a specific l-malate concentration (S), Vmax is the maximum activity, KA and KA′ are the dissociation constants of the activator (A) for the enzyme free and for the enzyme plus malate, respectively, and Φ is the ratio between k2 and k1. This last value (Φ) should be high than 1, as the activity when the allosteric site is occupied is high than when it is empty. The model of activation that fit best to the kinetic data obtained is shown as Scheme 1, where the activator (CoA) can bind to the free enzyme and to the enzyme complexed with the substrates. The decarboxylation of OAA was monitored by measuring the disappearance of OAA at 260 nm (ϵ260 nm = 850 m−1 cm−1) in an assay medium containing 50 mm Mes-NaOH, pH 5.5, 1 mm OAA, and 10 mm MnCl2 in a final volume of 0.25 ml. The reported velocities were corrected for the background rate resulting from the nonenzymatic OAA decarboxylation catalyzed by the divalent metal ion. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of NADH min−1 under the specified conditions. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Sedmak and Grossberg (22Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Different organs (leaf, stem, flowers, and roots) of 6-week-old Arabidopsis were ground in N2, and the resulting powder was suspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Mes-NaOH, pH 6.5, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenates were clarified by centrifugation and subjected to electrophoresis. Homogenates enriched in mitochondrial fraction from leaves were prepared by rounds of centrifugation, as previously described (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Denaturing PAGE (SDS-PAGE) was performed in 8% (w/v) or 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue or electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting. Antibodies against Arabidopsis NAD-ME1 or -2 were used for detection (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). When indicated, a mixture of purified antibodies against NAD-ME1 (1:500) and -2 (1:200) in a 1:1 relation were used. Bound antibodies were visualized by linking to alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Alkaline phosphatase activity was detected colorimetrically. Quantification of the intensity of the bands was conducted by image analysis software in at least three independent blots. Native PAGE was performed using a 6% (w/v) acrylamide separating gel. Electrophoresis was run at 150 V at 10 °C. Gels were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to Western blot analysis. CD spectra were made with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter using 0.1-cm path length cell and averaging 10 repetitive scans between 250 and 200 nm. Typically, 50 μg of the wild type or chimeric NAD-ME in phosphate buffer (20 mm NaPi, pH 6.5) were used for each assay. Mean residue ellipticity (Φ) was obtained by the equation. [Φ]=Φ×MMRW/10×d×c(Eq. 3) in which 111.42 was used as MMRW (the mean amino acid residue weight), d is the cell path in cm, and c is the concentration of the protein in mg/ml. To obtain the heteromeric Arabidopsis NAD-ME (NAD-MEH), NAD-ME1 fused to a His tag and NAD-ME2 without the His tag were co-expressed in E. coli. After induction of the expression, the bacterial extracts showed the presence of both proteins with the expected molecular masses of 80 kDa in the case of NAD-ME1 fusion protein and 58 kDa in the case of NAD-ME2 (Fig. 1A, lane 1). NAD-ME1 and -2 co-eluted after elution with imidazole (Fig. 1A, lane 3). To rule out the possibility of a nonspecific interaction of NAD-ME2 with the affinity column, E. coli expressing only NAD-ME2 without the His tag was similarly treated (Fig. 1A, lanes 5–7). In this case, NAD-ME2 mature protein was detected in bacterial extracts (Fig. 1A, lane 5) and the washing fractions (Fig. 1A, lane 6), but it was absent in the fraction eluted from the column after imidazole treatment (Fig. 1A, lane 7), indicating its failure to bind to the column due to the lack of the His tag. Moreover, specific antibodies against NAD-ME1 or -2 reacted with the respective proteins, indicating that the lower band that co-eluted with NAD-ME1 corresponds to NAD-ME2 and was not a partial proteolysis of NAD-ME1 (Fig. 1B). Densitometric analysis of the bands obtained after SDS-PAGE of the eluted fraction indicated that NAD-ME1 and -2 co-purify in an equimolar ratio (Fig. 1B, lane 1). These results indicate that the co-elution of NAD-ME1 and -2 is due to specific protein-protein interactions resulting in an heteromeric assembly (1:1) of NAD-ME1 and -2 (NAD-MEH). The purified recombinant NAD-MEH was analyzed by Western blot after native PAGE using a mixture of antibodies against NAD-ME1 and -2. NAD-MEH showed an immunoreactive band with similar mobility to the major immunoreactive band observed in Arabidopsis leaf mitochondrial extracts (Fig. 1C). Previous work demonstrated that this band is composed of both NAD-ME1 and -2, and it reacts with antibodies against NAD-ME1 or -2 used separately (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Apart from this band, mitochondrial extracts also show bands corresponding to NAD-ME1 and -2 homodimers (Fig. 1C). The native molecular mass of NAD-MEH determined by size exclusion chromatography was 125 ± 10 kDa. Thus, NAD-MEH is a dimer composed of NAD-ME1 and -2 in a 1:1 ratio. By the same technique, the native molecular mass of NAD-ME1 and -2 was previously estimated (120.0 and 117.5 kDa, respectively (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)). A kinetic characterization of the recombinant NAD-MEH was performed, and the results were compared with those obtained with NAD-ME1 and -2 homodimers. NAD-MEH has a pH activity optimum of 6.5 (Table 1), a value similar to those of NAD-ME1 and -2 (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The kcat and the Km values for NAD of NAD-MEH were also similar to those reported for the homodimers (Table 1). On the other hand, NAD-MEH displayed a non-hyperbolic kinetic behavior with respect to malate, showing sigmoidal kinetics (nH = 2). This kinetic response was also observed for NAD-ME1 but not for NAD-ME2 (Table 1 (12Tronconi M.A. Fahnenstich H. Gerrard Weehler M.C. Andreo C.S. Flügge U.I. Drincovich M.F. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)). Despite the different kinetics that were observed with respect to malate, the three enzymes showed similar affinity toward this substrate (Table 1). Hence, the three Arabidopsis NAD-MEs display similar catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for both NAD and malate (Table 1). Finally, as in the case of NAD-ME1 and -2, NAD-MEH was unable to decarboxylate OAA. Several intermediates of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were tested as possible effectors of the individual NAD-ME activities. The results indicated that each NAD-ME responds differentially to the effectors tested (Fig. 2). Interestingly, succinate and fumarate showed opposite effects on the activity of the homodimers (Fig. 2). Although NAD-ME1 was strongly activated by these organic acids, NAD-ME2 was inhibited. The activation effect of succinate and fumarate was also observed in the case of NAD-MEH (Fig. 2). On the other hand, although PEP and FBP were the strongest activators of NAD-ME2 and -H (nearly 400% activation with 2 mm PEP or FBP), they did not modify the activity of NAD-ME1 (Fig. 2). The three NAD-MEs were activated by 2-ketoglutarate, whereas OAA activated NAD-ME1 and -H but did not modify the activity of NAD-ME2 (Fig. 2). NAD-ME2 and -H were activated more than 2-fold in the presence of CoA or acetyl-CoA, whereas the activity of NAD-ME1 was not significantly modified (Fig. 2). Finally, phosphorylated nucleosides (AMP and ATP) did not significantly modify the activity of the NAD-MEs even at high concentrations (Fig. 2). The apparent activation constant (A50, activator concentration that gives 50% of activation) was estimated in the case of FBP, PEP, and fumarate (Table 2). The results showed that NAD-MEH is more sensitive with respect to FBP and PEP than NAD-ME2, exhibiting a 5.2- and 4.8-fold decrease in the A50 value, respectively (Table 2). NAD-MEH displays a similar apparent affinity (A50 values) for fumarate as NAD-ME1 (Table 2).TABLE 2Apparent activation constant (A50) for FBP, PEP, fumarate, and CoAFBPPEPFumarateCoAμmmmmmμmNAD-ME1−−1.1−NAD-ME21150.48−15.0NAD-MEH22.00.100.8416.1 Open table in a new tab CoA is a typical activator of plant NAD-MEs, and it is present at high levels in mitochondria (24Wedding R.T Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 367-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of NAD-ME2 and NAD-MEH by CoA was further analyzed. In the presence of 50 μm CoA, NAD-ME2 and NAD-MEH optimum pH was shifted to a more alkaline value (pH 6.8; TABLE 1, TABLE 2, TABLE 3). In addition, in the presence of CoA, the NAD saturation curves of NAD-ME2 and NAD-MEH did not significantly differ from the ones obtained in the absence of CoA (not shown), but the kinetic behavior of both enzymes with l-malate was dependent on the CoA concentration (Fig. 3). The CoA activation effect was examined by varying l-malate concentration at several fixed concentratio"

Drug targeting of bacterial cytoskeletal proteins requires detailed knowledge of the various filamentous suprastructures and dynamic properties. Here, we have investigated by high resolution electron microscopy the assembly of cell division protein and microtubule homolog FtsZ from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtbFtsZ) in vitro in the presence of various monovalent salts, crowding agents and polycations. Supramolecular structures, including two-dimensional rings, three-dimensional toroids, and multistranded helices formed in the presence of molecular crowding, were similar to those observed by fluorescence microscopy in bacteria in vivo. Dynamic properties of MtbFtsZ filaments were visualized by light scattering and real time total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Interestingly, MtbFtsZ revealed a form of dynamic instability at steady state. Cation-induced condensation phenomena of bacterial cytomotive polymers have not been investigated in any detail, although it is known that many bacteria can contain high amounts of polycations, which may modulate the prokaryotic cytoskeleton. We find that above a threshold concentration of polycations which varied with the valence of the cation, ionic strength, and pH, MtbFtsZ mainly formed sheets. The general features of these cation-induced condensation phenomena could be explained in the framework of the Manning condensation theory. Chirality and packing defects limited the dimensions of sheets and toroids at steady state as predicted by theoretical models. In first approximation simple physical principles seem to govern the formation of MtbFtsZ suprastructures."
https://openalex.org/W2109441068,"alpha-Secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is of great interest because it prevents the formation of the Alzheimer-linked amyloid-beta peptide. APP belongs to a conserved gene family including the two paralogues APP-like protein (APLP) 1 and 2. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) stimulates the shedding of all three proteins. IGF-1-induced shedding of both APP and APLP1 is dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), whereas APLP2 shedding is independent of this signaling pathway. Here, we used human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to investigate the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) in the proteolytic processing of endogenously expressed members of the APP family. Processing was induced by IGF-1 or retinoic acid, another known stimulator of APP alpha-secretase shedding. Our results show that stimulation of APP and APLP1 processing involves multiple signaling pathways, whereas APLP2 processing is mainly dependent on PKC. Next, we wanted to investigate whether the difference in the regulation of APLP2 shedding compared with APP shedding could be due to involvement of different processing enzymes. We focused on the two major alpha-secretase candidates ADAM10 and TACE, which both are members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family. Shedding was analyzed in the presence of the ADAM10 inhibitor GI254023X, or after transfection with small interfering RNAs targeted against TACE. The results clearly demonstrate that different alpha-secretases are involved in IGF-1-induced processing. APP is mainly cleaved by ADAM10, whereas APLP2 processing is mediated by TACE. Finally, we also show that IGF-1 induces PKC-dependent phosphorylation of TACE."

The interaction of Sema3A/NRP1 during development leads to the collapse of growth cones. Here we show that Sema3A also induces death of cultured cortical neurons through NRP1. A specific NRP1 inhibitory peptide ameliorated Sema3A-evoked cortical axonal retraction and neuronal death. Moreover, Sema3A was also involved in cerebral ischemia-induced neuronal death. Expression levels of Sema3A and NRP1, but not NRP2, were significantly increased early during brain reperfusion following transient focal cerebral ischemia.

IntroductionInjured central nervous system axons have a very limited capacity to regenerate due to the presence of a plethora of growth inhibitory ligands secreted from oligodendrocytes/myelin, reactive astrocytes, and fibroblasts in the damaged tissue (1.De Winter F.

Neurons must integrate this multitude of inhibitory molecular cues, generated as a result of cortical damage, into a functional response. More often than not the response is one of growth cone collapse, axonal retraction, and neuronal death. Therefore, chemorepulsive factors likely contribute either directly or indirectly to neuronal death in the injured adult brain (7.Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J.

Indeed, the expression of Sema3A, a major chemorepulsive factor, has been reported in several brain injury models, such as peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury, cerebral ischemia, and Alzheimer disease (1.De Winter F.

In addition, Sema3A expression has been shown to increase vascular permeability, which may indirectly contribute to neuronal damage (17.Acevedo L.M. Barillas S. Weis S.M. Göthert J.R. Cheresh D.A. Blood. 2008; 111: 2674-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).The biological activities of Sema3A during development are complex and context-dependent. Although best known for its role as an axonal growth cone repellent, Sema3A also serves as a chemoattractant during cortical layer development by guiding the radial migration of layer II/III cortical neurons (18.Chen G. Sima J. Jin M. Wang K.Y. Xue X.J. Zheng W. Ding Y.Q. Yuan X.B. Nat.

In this study, the neuroprotective effects of blocking NRP1 interaction with Sema3A were investigated and the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Fer was determined as a downstream effecter for NRP1-mediated death signal transduction.DISCUSSIONThe present study revealed two very important findings: 1) the interaction between the chemorepulsive guidance molecule Sema3A and its receptor NRP1 is important in neuronal death both in cultured cortical neurons and during cerebral ischemia and 2) NRP1 directly interacts with the cytoplasmic non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fer to mediate neurite damage and neuronal death.Although Sema/NRP's functions during development have been established (16.Pasterkamp R.J. Giger R.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 18.Chen G. Sima J. Jin M. Wang K.Y. Xue X.J. Zheng W. Ding Y.Q. Yuan X.B. Nat.

Yuan X.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 356: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), their functions in the injured adult brains are just starting to be understood. Although several correlative studies have implicated semaphorins in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, motor neuron degeneration, and injuries caused by cerebral ischemia (16.Pasterkamp R.J. Giger R.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 44.De Winter F. Holtmaat A.J. Verhaagen J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 515: 115-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), direct evidence showing Sema3A-mediating neuronal death only comes from developmental evidence of sensory neurons (22.Shirvan A. Ziv I.

An antibody to Sema3A has been shown to rescue retinal ganglion cells from cell death following optic nerve axotomy in vivo (23.Shirvan A. Kimron M. Holdengreber V. Ziv I. Ben Shaul Y. Melamed S. Melamed E. Barzilai A. Solomon A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49799-49807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and blocking Sema3A using a selective chemical inhibitor also enhanced nerve regeneration of transacted spinal cord in adult mice (15.Kaneko S. Iwanami A. Nakamura M. Kishino A. Kikuchi K. Shibata S. Okano H.J. Ikegami T. Moriya A. Konishi O. Nakayama C. Kumagai K. Kimura T. Sato Y. Goshima Y. Taniguchi M. Ito M. He Z. Toyama Y. Okano H. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 1380-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Altogether, it is clear that inhibiting Sema3A may provide a therapeutic potential against neuronal death. What is not clear, however, is whether Sema3A function is occurring via NRP1 or NRP2, and perhaps more importantly what specific intracellular signals are being employed to mediate neuroprotection. In the present study, we used a synthetic peptide blocking Sema3A/NRP1 interaction to show successful neuroprotection both in cultured cortical neurons and in ischemic brains. The following evidence derived from this study demonstrated a direct causal relationship of Sema3A/NRP1 interaction with the death of adult cortical neurons: 1) Sema3A protein caused axonal growth cone collapse, axonal damage, and neuronal death positive to both PI and TUNEL staining; 2) NRP1 inhibitory peptides, capable of preventing Sema3A/NRP1 interaction, prevented Sema3A-mediated neuronal death. Most importantly, Sema3A/NRP1 expression increased soon after ischemia reperfusion, and the NRP1 inhibitory peptides are neuroprotective to the brain during ischemia, suggesting the Sema3A/NRP1 pathway contributes to the acute cascade of deleterious biochemical events leading to ischemic neuronal death. Based on the expression profile of Sema3A/NRP1, the present study only examined the contribution of Sema3A/NRP1 after 24-h reperfusion. The long term benefit of blocking Sema3A/NRP1 interaction in ischemic brains remains to be investigated.The MALDI-MS-based molecular imaging, although still in its infancy as a method, proved to be a novel and precise way to examine the integrity and distribution of the injected NRP1 inhibitory peptide (39.Trim P.J. Henson C.M. Avery J.L. McEwen A. Snel M.F. Claude E. Marshall P.S. West A. Princivalle A.P. Clench M.R. Anal. Chem. 2008; 80: 8628-8634Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 45.Rohner T.C.

Med. 2001; 7: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Using this method, we showed that NRP1 inhibitory peptide was able to cross the parenchyma following cerebral ischemia, presumably through the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier as indicated by the higher level of signal in the ipsilateral side of the brain. NRP1 inhibitory peptide permeated a large area of the brain both in the cortex and striatum based on the MALDI-MSI data, which corresponds well with the area of MCAO-induced damage. This approach allowed a direct visualization of the integrity and distribution of the injected NRP1 inhibitor peptide and validated the findings that the neuroprotection observed in the NRP1 inhibitory peptide-treated brains was indeed due to the presence of the peptide.Sema3A negatively affects the efficacy of synaptic transmission evoked in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices (47.Bouzioukh F. Daoudal G. Falk J. Debanne D. Rougon G. Castellani V. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 23: 2247-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). From the current in vitro data, it is clear that NRP1 inhibitory peptide-mediated neuroprotection was independent of NMDA receptor-induced [Ca2+]i. The ratiometric [Ca2+]i measurement showed that neither the NRP1 inhibitory peptide, nor Sema3A protein alone, had any effect on neuronal [Ca2+]i. Most importantly, addition of NRP1 inhibitory peptide or Sema3A protein did not affect NMDA receptor-mediated [Ca2+]i influx into neurons as shown in Fig. 5, thereby excluding the possibility that NRP1-mediated neuronal death may be involved in coupling with NMDA receptors. These studies prompted us to search for NRP1-specific downstream effectors, of which there are not many known potential candidates to choose from. The cytoplasmic domain of NRP1 is relatively short, and it is believed that the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of NRP1 is unable to mediate functional responses to Sema3A (48.Tamagnone L. Comoglio P.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 377-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, surprisingly, based on an extended search for NRP1-selective interacting proteins using a co-immunoprecipitation approach, we found that Fer kinase was selectively associated with the NRP1 cytoplasmic domain. Most significantly, blocking Sema3A/NRP1 interaction with the specific synthetic inhibitory peptide reduced Fer binding to the NRP1 cytoplasmic domain. The reduction in Fer association with NRP1 cytoplasmic domain correlated well with neuroprotection. Together, these findings explain the selectivity of NRP1 in downstream signal transduction through Fer. Most interestingly, down-regulation of Fer expression is neuroprotective against Sema3A and cerebral ischemia as shown in FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9, respectively. The fact that Fer−/− dorsal root ganglion neurons are not responsive to Sema3A (42.Shapovalova Z. Tabunshchyk K. Greer P.A. BMC Dev. Biol. 2007; 7: 133Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) strongly indicates a role of Fer in neuronal response to Sema3A. This study, for the first time, clearly demonstrated that Fer is an important part of the death signal transduction pathway in adult cortical neurons. It remains unclear at this stage as to the downstream effectors for NRP1/Fer-mediated neuronal death, and they are currently being investigated. Possible candidates include collapsin response mediator proteins, which, we have previously shown, are important in mediating ischemic neuronal death (11.Hou S.T. Keklikian A. Slinn J. O'Hare M.

Blocking Sema3A/NRP1 interaction is neuroprotective even during a relatively acute phase of stroke, firmly establishing Sema3A/NRP1/Fer as part of the damage response in acute stroke-induced neuronal death. Although the long term benefit of blocking Sema3A/NRP1 remains to be established, understanding this interaction provided a novel avenue to target non-NMDA receptors for development of therapeutics against stroke-induced brain damage. IntroductionInjured central nervous system axons have a very limited capacity to regenerate due to the presence of a plethora of growth inhibitory ligands secreted from oligodendrocytes/myelin, reactive astrocytes, and fibroblasts in the damaged tissue (1.De Winter F.

Neurons must integrate this multitude of inhibitory molecular cues, generated as a result of cortical damage, into a functional response. More often than not the response is one of growth cone collapse, axonal retraction, and neuronal death. Therefore, chemorepulsive factors likely contribute either directly or indirectly to neuronal death in the injured adult brain (7.Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 8.Wakade T.D. Palmer K.C. McCauley R. Przywara D.A. Wakade A.R. J.

Indeed, the expression of Sema3A, a major chemorepulsive factor, has been reported in several brain injury models, such as peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury, cerebral ischemia, and Alzheimer disease (1.De Winter F.

Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In addition, Sema3A expression has been shown to increase vascular permeability, which may indirectly contribute to neuronal damage (17.Acevedo L.M. Barillas S. Weis S.M. Göthert J.R. Cheresh D.A. Blood. 2008; 111: 2674-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).The biological activities of Sema3A during development are complex and context-dependent. Although best known for its role as an axonal growth cone repellent, Sema3A also serves as a chemoattractant during cortical layer development by guiding the radial migration of layer II/III cortical neurons (18.Chen G. Sima J. Jin M. Wang K.Y. Xue X.J. Zheng W. Ding Y.Q. Yuan X.B. Nat.

Genetic evidence indicates that Cul8, together with Mms1, Mms22, and Esc4, is involved in the repair of DNA damage that can occur during DNA replication. Cul8 is thought to form a complex with these proteins, but the composition and the function of Cul8-based E3 ubiquitin ligases remain largely uncharacterized. Herein, we report a comprehensive biochemical analysis of Cul8 complexes. Cul8 was found to form a Cul8-Mms1-Mms22-Esc4 complex under physiological conditions, with Mms1 bridging Cul8 and Mms22 and Mms22 bridging Mms1 and Esc4. Domain analysis demonstrated that the N-terminal region of Mms1 and the C-terminal region of Mms22 are required for the Mms1-Mms22 interaction, whereas the N-terminal region of Mms22 is required for the Mms22-Esc4 interaction. We also found other Cul8-Mms1-binding proteins Ctf4, Esc2, and Orc5 using yeast two-hybrid screening. Esc4 and Ctf4 bound to Mms22 directly and bound to Cul8-Mms1 in the presence of Mms22, whereas Esc2 and Orc5 interacted with both Cul8 and Mms1, independently. We found that Cul8, Mms1, and Mms22 participated in the regulation of transcriptional silencing of yeast telomeres.

https://openalex.org/W2003205595,"The catalytic domain of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT) translocates directly across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells to induce toxicity by the production of cAMP. Here, we use electrophysiology to examine the translocation of toxin into polarized epithelial cells that model the mucosal surfaces of the host. We find that both polarized T84 cell monolayers and human airway epithelial cultures respond to nanomolar concentrations of ACT when applied to basolateral membranes, with little or no response to toxin applied apically. The induction of toxicity is rapid and fully explained by increases in intracellular cAMP, consistent with toxin translocation directly across the basolateral membrane. Intoxication of T84 cells occurs in the absence of CD11b/CD18 or evidence of another specific membrane receptor, and it is not dependent on post-translational acylation of the toxin or on host cell membrane potential, both previously reported to be required for toxin action. Thus, elements of the basolateral membrane render epithelial cells highly sensitive to the entry of ACT in the absence of a specific receptor for toxin binding."
https://openalex.org/W2067478765,"The cellular processes that regulate Bcl-2 at the posttranslational levels are as important as those that regulate bcl-2 synthesis. Previously we demonstrated that the suppression of FK506-binding protein 38 (FKBP38) contributes to the instability of Bcl-2 or leaves Bcl-2 unprotected from degradation in an unknown mechanism. Here, we studied the underlying molecular mechanism mediating this process. We first showed that Bcl-2 binding-defective mutants of FKBP38 fail to accumulate Bcl-2 protein. We demonstrated that the FKBP38-mediated Bcl-2 stability is specific as the levels of other anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1 remained unaffected. FKBP38 enhanced the Bcl-2 stability under the blockade of de novo protein synthesis, indicating it is posttranslational. We showed that the overexpression of FKBP38 attenuates reduction rate of Bcl-2, thus resulting in an increment of the intracellular Bcl-2 level, contributing to the resistance of apoptotic cell death induced by the treatment of kinetin riboside, an anticancer drug. Caspase inhibitors markedly induced the accumulation of Bcl-2. In caspase-3-activated cells, the knockdown of endogenous FKBP38 by small interfering RNA resulted in Bcl-2 down-regulation as well, which was significantly recovered by the treatment with caspase inhibitors or overexpression of FKBP38. Finally we presented that the Bcl-2 cleavage by caspase-3 is blocked when Bcl-2 binds to FKBP38 through the flexible loop. Taken together, these results suggest that FKBP38 is a key player in regulating the function of Bcl-2 by antagonizing caspase-dependent degradation through the direct interaction with the flexible loop domain of Bcl-2, which contains the caspase cleavage site."

Ccc1 levels are decreased in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells, but the activity of the transporter is increased, resulting is reduced cytosolic iron. Overexpression of CCC1 in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells results in a severe growth defect due to decreased cytosolic iron, referred to as the mitochondria-vacuole signaling (MVS) phenotype. Mutants were identified that suppress the MVS growth defect, and FRA1 was identified as a gene that suppresses the MVS phenotype. Overexpression of FRA1 suppresses altered transition metal metabolism in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells, whereas deletion of FRA1 is synthetically lethal with Δmrs3Δmrs4. Fra1 binds to Tsa1, which encodes a thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase. Deletion of TSA1 or TRR1 is synthetically lethal in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells, suggesting that Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells generate reactive oxygen metabolites.

Mitochondria are well recognized as the site for energy production and biosynthetic pathways. Mitochondria are central for a variety of downstream signaling pathways initiated by perturbations in mitochondrial activities. Most notably, in many eukaryotes decreased mitochondrial function results in apoptosis. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been useful in dissecting the genetics and biochemistry of mitochondrial signaling events. Loss of mitochondrial heme synthesis leads to changes in the transcription of a wide variety of genes mediated by the Hap family of transcription factors (1.Mense S.M. Zhang L. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Decreased mitochondrial respiration, independent of effects on heme synthesis, affects the transcription of nuclear genes that result in a reconfiguration of energy metabolism, referred to as the retrograde response (2.Liu Z. Butow R.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2006; 40: 159-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Finally, alteration in mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster synthesis can induce expression of genes involved in iron metabolism (3.Chen O.S. Crisp R.J. Valachovic M. Bard M. Winge D.R. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29513-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We showed that deletion of two nuclear genes MRS3 and MRS4, which encode homologous mitochondrial iron transporters, had effects on cellular metal metabolism (4.Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

Deletion of MRS3 or MRS4 individually had no phenotype, but a double deletion showed impaired mitochondrial iron metabolism when cells were grown on low iron medium (4.Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

Mitochondrial iron-consuming processes such as heme and iron-sulfur cluster synthesis appeared normal when Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells were grown in iron-sufficient medium, suggesting that low affinity iron transport systems can supply iron to the mitochondria. In iron-sufficient medium, however, Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells showed abnormalities in iron homeostasis as well as alterations in response to other transition metals (4.Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33653-33661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We showed that many of the phenotypes in the double deletion could be suppressed by deleting CCC1. The vacuole in yeast is the iron storage organelle, and Ccc1 is the only known vacuolar iron importer (7.Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The observation that a deletion in CCC1 rescues the phenotype of a Δmrs3Δmrs4 cell suggests that loss of the mitochondrial iron transporters induces changes in vacuolar iron transport.

Using a genetic screen for mutants defective in the MVS pathway, we identify FRA1 as a gene that affects MVS phenotypes. We provide genetic and biochemical data showing that Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells show increased levels of oxidants and that Fra1 interacts with the thioredoxins-dependent peroxiredoxin Tsa1 to reduce oxidant damage.

Galactose medium was prepared by adding 2% galactose instead of 2% dextrose. Media was made iron-deficient by addition 80 μm bathophenanthroline sulfonate (BPS) and specific concentrations of ferrous ammonium sulfate. The concentration of added iron in μm is denoted as BPS(x). The BBLTM GasPakTM Plus anaerobic system (BD Biosciences) was used for anaerobic experiments. CCC1 was cloned with either a MET3 promoter or a GAL1 promoter. FRA1 and FRA2 were cloned with their endogenous promoters or a GAL1 promoter. RIM2 was cloned with its own promoter. pHA-TSA1 and pHA-TSA1C4Ss were generous gifts from Dr. David Eide, University of Wisconsin. We chose 50% killing for UV mutagenesis. The exposure time was determined by establishing a UV killing curve. Genomic DNA was isolated from MVS mutant cells (mvs6-3 and mvs6-4), digested with Sau3AI, and applied to a 10–40% sucrose gradient to separate DNA fragments as described previously (9.Tuttle M.S. Radisky D. Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1273-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The appropriate 10-kb-size DNA fractions were collected and ligated into pRS416 zero vector digested with BamHI. mRNA was measured by reverse transcription-PCR. Briefly, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using SuperScript III from Invitrogen. Reverse transcription-PCR used the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C, annealing at 58 °C, elongation at 72 °C in a Roche Lightcycler 2.0 from Idaho Technology. Primers for FRA1 were 5′-ATG AGA GGA ACA TCG GCA TC-3′ and 5′-AAC AGA CCC ATT TCC AGC AC-3′. CMD1 was used as an internal control. Cells were homogenized using glass beads and vacuoles isolated as described previously (7.Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed on a 12% SDS-PAGE, and Western blot transfer was performed. Antisera used for probing Westerns included: rabbit anti-CCC1 serum, used at a 1:500 dilution; rabbit anti-FRA1 serum and rabbit anti-FRA2 serum, used at a 1:3000 dilution; rabbit anti-HA (Invitrogen), used at a 1:5000 dilution; mouse anti-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) (Invitrogen), used at a 1:10,000 dilution; mouse anti-carboxypeptidase Y (Invitrogen), used at a 1:2000 dilution. Affinity purification was performed using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) for HIS-tagged proteins or DYNAL magnetic beads with sheep anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Protein identification was provided by the Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Core Facility, University of Utah. The construction and measurement of FET3-lacZ and measurement of β-galactosidase activity was performed as described previously (10.Li L. Bagley D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Specific activity was calculated as nmol/min/mg of protein. The production of reactive oxygen species was measured using DCFDA from Invitrogen. After the addition of 15 μm DCFDA in culture media for 1 h, 2 × 108 log-phase grown cells were harvested. Cells were washed once with water, twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized by vortexing with glass beads at 4 °C for 10 min, and supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Fluorescence was measured using an excitation wavelength of 504 nm and an emission wavelength of 524 nm in a PerkinElmer LS55 luminescence spectrometer. The results were normalized to protein concentration using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Log phase-grown wild type or Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells (A600) were resuspended in iron-free Lim medium with 0.5 μm 59Fe, 1 mm ascorbate acid, and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Cells were washed with EDTA-containing buffers. The washed cells were resuspended in CM medium and incubated at 30 °C for another 2 h. After incubation, vacuoles were isolated as described previously (4.Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33653-33661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Radioactivity in vacuolar fractions was determined by gamma counting, and the data were for normalized to protein concentration. Deletion of MRS3 and MRS4 resulted in decreased cytosolic iron, which was mediated by the vacuolar iron transporter Ccc1 (4.Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33653-33661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To determine whether the amount or activity of Ccc1 was affected, we examined the level of Ccc1 in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells. Western analysis showed that Ccc1 levels were much lower in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells than in wild type cells (Fig. 1A). Studies have shown that CCC1 mRNA levels are increased by high iron through the transcription factor Yap5 (10.Li L. Bagley D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and the message destabilized under low iron by Cth1 and Cth2, which are expressed in low iron conditions through the low iron-sensing transcription factor Aft1 (11.Puig S. Vergara S.V. Thiele D.J. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The observation that cytosolic iron is decreased in the face of lower than normal amounts of Ccc1 suggests that deletion of MRS3/MRS4 increases the activity of Ccc1. Exposure of cells to radioactive iron showed that vacuoles from Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells contained higher levels of 59Fe than vacuoles from wild type cells (Fig. 1B). This result confirms our previous finding that Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells had increased vacuolar iron compared with wild type cells, as determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (4.Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33653-33661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As the increased activity of endogenous Ccc1 led to decreased growth, we reasoned that increased expression of Ccc1 in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells would lead to a profound growth defect. We transformed Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells with a plasmid containing a MET3-regulated CCC1. In the presence of methionine, Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells grew as well as wild type cells. In the absence of methionine, which leads to expression of CCC1, Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells showed a pronounced growth defect relative to control cells transformed with pMET3CCC1 (Fig. 1C). Similar results were observed using a GAL1CCC1 plasmid (data not shown). Increased expression of CCC1 in wild type cells led to decreased cytosolic iron as shown by increased activity of a FET3lacZ reporter construct, a surrogate assay for activation of the iron-regulon (Fig. 1D, left panel). In Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells, FET3lacZ activity is increased compared with wild type cells (4.Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33653-33661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CCC1 in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells resulted in increased FET3lacZ activity, indicating a greater depletion of cytosolic iron. Iron supplementation reduced FET3lacZ activity in wild type cells overexpressing Ccc1 but did not suppress activity in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells overexpressing Ccc1 (Fig. 1D, right panel). The addition of iron to the medium suppressed the poor growth resulting from overexpression of Ccc1 in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells (Fig. 1E). Western blot analysis revealed that Ccc1 levels, expressed by the iron-independent MET3 promoter and lacking the normal 3′-untranslated region, were lower in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells than in control cell incubated in the same medium (Fig. 1F). These results indicate that the Ccc1-mediated decrease in cell growth in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells was not the result of an increase in Ccc1 level, indicating that the transport activity of Ccc1 must be affected. We took advantage of the severe growth defect seen in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells overexpressing CCC1 (referred to as the MVS phenotype) to identify mutants that could suppress the growth defect (Fig. 2A). Cells (Δmrs3Δmrs4 transformed with pMET3CCC1) were UV-mutagenized in the presence of methionine and then replica-plated to medium lacking methionine. Cells able to grow in the absence of methionine were selected and retested. We identified eight candidates that were able to grow in the absence of methionine. We focused our efforts on characterizing two mutants, mvs6-3 and mvs6-4. One of the phenotypes of Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells is an inability to grow on low iron plates, which reflects the absence of high affinity mitochondrial iron transport activity. When cured of the MET3CCC1 plasmid, the mutants showed no growth defect in the absence of methionine and a low iron growth defect, indicating that suppression of the MVS phenotype was not due to mutations that affected mitochondrial iron homeostasis (data not shown). These mutants, when retransformed with a MET3CCC1 or a GAL1-regulated CCC1 plasmid, did not show a growth defect in the absence of methionine or in galactose-containing medium, whereas the parent strain transformed with the same plasmid showed a growth defect (data not shown). These results show that the suppression of the MVS phenotype was not due to an alteration in MRS3/MRS4 or plasmid borne CCC1 but in genes that affected Ccc1 activity. The Δmrs3Δmrs4 strain shows phenotypes related to transition metals, notably increased resistance to cobalt and decreased resistance to copper (4.Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33653-33661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These phenotypes were suppressed when CCC1 was deleted, showing that the phenotypes were due to Ccc1. MVS mutant cells show a metal phenotype more similar to wild type cells with increased cobalt sensitivity and decreased copper sensitivity (Fig. 2B). We determined whether the MVS phenotype is recessive or dominant. MVS mutants were mated with Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells of the opposite mating type. The cells were transformed with pMET3CCC1 and then plated on medium either lacking or containing methionine. All diploids grew in the presence of methionine (data not shown). In the absence of methionine, homozygous Δmrs3Δmrs4 diploids showed a growth defect when CCC1 was expressed (see Fig. 4E). Diploids generated between mvs6-3 strains and parental Δmrs3Δmrs4 showed improved growth when CCC1 was expressed, indicating that the MVS phenotype was dominant. To identify MVS genes, we generated a genomic library from mvs6-3 in a low copy vector and then transformed that library into Δmrs3mrs4 cells containing the MET3CCC1 plasmid. Transformed cells were plated in the absence of methionine, and resistant colonies were identified. We identified 12 colonies that were resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of increased CCC1 expression. Plasmids were isolated from those colonies, sequenced, and then subcloned to identify the gene responsible for suppressing the MVS phenotype. We determined that the plasmids contained either of two genes, RIM2 or FRA1, responsible for suppressing the MVS phenotype (Fig. 3A). RIM2 and FRA1 from a genomic library of mvs6-4 were also identified as suppressors of the MVS phenotype. RIM2 encodes a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, which is a homologue of MRS3 and MRS4. Expression of RIM2 partially suppressed the low iron growth defect of Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells (Fig. 3B). This result suggests RIM2 encodes a functional homologue of MRS3/MRS4. Because the MVS growth deficit requires deletion of both MRS3 and MRS4, increased expression of RIM2 complements the effects of MRS3/MRS4 deletions. Expression of FRA1 did not complement the growth phenotype of Δmrs3Δmrs4 on low iron (Fig. 3B). FRA1 was previously identified as part of a cytosolic protein complex involved in the signaling pathway leading to transcription of the iron regulon (12.Kumánovics A. Chen O.S. Li L. Bagley D. Adkins E.M. Lin H. Dingra N.N. Outten C.E. Keller G. Winge D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10276-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Expression of FRA1 isolated from a wild type library, cloned in the same low copy vector as used to construct the genomic library, permitted a Δmrs3Δmrs4 (pMET3CCC1) strain to survive. To determine whether the expression of FRA1 affects other MVS phenotypes, a FRA1-containing plasmid was transformed into Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells, and the metal phenotypes of the transformed cells were examined. Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells are Cu+-and Cd2+-sensitive but are Co2+-resistant; transformation with FRA1 plasmids normalizes metal sensitivity in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells (Fig. 3C). Sequencing of FRA1 isolated from either mvs6-3 or mvs6-4 did not reveal any mutation in the coding sequence or in the promoter (500 bp upstream from the ATG). The above data suggest that even low copy expression of FRA1 may affect the MVS phenotype. We examined whether there was increased expression of FRA1 in MVS cells. Western blot analysis did not show any increase in Fra1 levels in mvs6-3. (Fig. 4A). Reverse transcription-PCR analysis also did not reveal any increase in FRA1 mRNA levels in mvs6-3 (1.15 ± 0.05) or mvs6-4 (1.26 ± 0.13) compared with parental Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells. These results do not reflect an inability to detect changes in mRNA, as we could detect increased mRNA levels in cells transformed with a low copy plasmid containing FRA1 expressed by its endogenous promoter (3.59 ± 0.62). We used a genetic approach to determine the role of FRA1 in the MVS phenotype. Deletion of FRA1 in wild type cells did not show any growth defect (Fig. 4B). In contrast, deletion of FRA1 in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells led to a severe growth defect. If the growth defect is due to an effect on Ccc1 activity, then deletion of CCC1 should suppress the defect. Indeed, deletion of CCC1 in a Δmrs3Δmrs4Δfra1 strain suppressed the poor growth. The poor growth of the Δmrs3Δmrs4Δfra1 strain was suppressed by transformation with a FRA1-containing plasmid (Fig. 4C). The Δmrs3Δmrs4Δfra1 strain grew poorly and could not be transformed with pMET3CCC1 even in the presence of high methionine. To examine the effect of increased expression of CCC1 in the triple deletion strain, we transformed the strain with a FRA1 plasmid and then with a MET3CCC1 plasmid. The FRA1 plasmid had the URA3 gene, permitting us to use fluoroorotic acid to select against the presence of the plasmid. In the presence of methionine, Δmrs3Δmrs4Δfra1 (pMET3CCC1) cells are viable (Fig. 4D). In the absence of methionine, Δmrs3Δmrs4Δfra1(pMET3CCC1) cells lost viability. These results show that the loss of FRA1 exacerbates the MVS phenotype. The data showing that deletion of FRA1 in a Δmrs3Δmrs4 strain affects the MVS phenotype does not answer the question of whether FRA1 is responsible for the suppression of the MVS phenotype in the MVS mutant cells. To examine if FRA1 is necessary for suppressing the MVS phenotype, we deleted FRA1 in mvs6-3 and examined the effect of that deletion. As mentioned above, mvs6-3 is dominant. A diploid strain between two Δmrs3Δmrs4 haploids shows the MVS phenotype of poor growth when CCC1 is overexpressed, whereas a diploid between Δmrs3Δmrs4 and mvs6-3 grew better (Fig. 4E). Deletion of one copy of FRA1 in a diploid Δmrs3Δmrs4 did not rescue the MVS phenotype. A diploid of Δmrs3Δmrs4 and mvs6-3Δfra1 still showed suppression of the MVS phenotype. We conclude from these results that FRA1 is required to suppress the MVS defect, but the mutation in mvs6-3 is not in FRA1 but, rather, affects FRA1 acting in trans. FRA1 was identified through its effect on induction of the iron-regulon, as a deletion in FRA1 increases transcription of Aft1-regulated genes such as FET3 (12.Kumánovics A. Chen O.S. Li L. Bagley D.

Deletion of both FRA1 and FRA2 did not induce the iron regulon beyond that seen in single deletions (12.Kumánovics A. Chen O.S. Li L. Bagley D. Adkins E.M. Lin H. Dingra N.N. Outten C.E. Keller G.

To determine whether FRA2 is involved in the MVS phenotype, we examined the effect of overexpressing FRA2 in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells. Overexpression of FRA2 did not affect the pMET3CCC1-induced growth defect in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells (Fig. 5A). Deletion of FRA2 in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells did not affect cell growth (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that FRA2 does not affect the MVS phenotype. Because expression of FRA1 can affect the behavior of Ccc1 in Δmrs3Δmrs4 cells, we then asked whether expression of FRA1 affects the ability of Ccc1 to transport iron into the vacuole in cells containing MRS3/MRS4. Deletion of CCC1 results in sensitivity to high iron; thus, reduced expression of CCC1 might lead to a growth defect in high iron medium. Transformation of FRA1 into wild type cells (data not shown) or into Δccc1 cells transformed with MET3CCC1 plasmid did not affect growth on high iron plates (Fig. 6A). Based on these results we conclude that Fra1 does not affect Ccc1 directly but only in the absence of MRS3 and MRS4. In wild type cells, deletion of FRA1 increases expression of the iron-regulon, as shown by increased expression of a FET3-lacZ reporter construct (12.Kumánovics A. Chen O.S. Li L. Bagley D. Adkins E.M. Lin H. Dingra N.N. Outten C.E. Keller G. Winge D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10276-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We determined if the FRA1 effect on the MVS phenotype required Aft1, the transcriptional regulator of the iron-regulon. Deletion of AFT1 did not suppress the MVS phenotype, and transformation of FRA1 into Δmrs3Δmrs4Δaft1 cells suppressed the grown defect (Fig. 6B). These results show that the ability of FRA1 to suppress the growth defect of the MVS phenotype is independent of Aft1. The MVS phenotype is oxygen-dependent, as cells grown anaerobically did not show MVS growth defect (Fig. 7A). Suppression of the MVS growth defect did not result from a loss of respiration, as shown by the fact that MVS Rho° cells generated by"

PDEF (prostate-derived Ets factor) has been under investigation for its role in tumor development and progression. However, the role of PDEF in cancer development has been controversial. Some reports link PDEF to tumor promoter, and others show tumor-suppressing functions in various systems under different conditions. So far, there has been no conclusive evidence from in vivo experiments to prove the role of PDEF. We have used both in vitro and in vivo systems to provide a conclusive role of PDEF in the progression process. PDEF-expressing cells block the cell growth rate, and this retardation was reversible when PDEF expression was silenced with PDEF-specific small interfering RNA. When these PDEF-expressing cells were orthotopically implanted into the mouse mammary gland, tumor incidence and growth rate were significantly retarded. Cell cycle analysis revealed that PDEF expression partially blocked cell cycle progression at G1/S without an effect on apoptosis. PDEF overexpression resulted in an increase in p21/CIP1 at both the mRNA and protein levels, resulting in decreased Cdk2 activity. Promoter deletion analysis, electrophoresis mobility shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies identified the functional Ets DNA binding site at −2118 bp of the p21/CIP1 gene promoter. This site is capable of binding and responding to PDEF. Furthermore, we silenced p21/CIP1 expression in PDEF-overexpressing cells by small interfering RNA. p21-silenced PDEF cells exhibited significantly increased cell growth in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating the p21 regulation by PDEF as a key player. These experiments identified PDEF as a new transcription factor that directly regulates p21/CIP1 expression under non-stressed conditions.

The heterodimer of Jun and Fos binds to AP-1 promoter site with high affinity and expresses cyclin D1 as cell proliferator (7Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). Higher activity of NF-κB is a common characteristic of many tumor cells (1Rayet B. Gelinas C.

TNF superfamily members convey signals that elicit diverse cellular responses. Trimerization of TNF receptors recruits adapter proteins (members of the TNF receptor-associated factor family) to the cytoplasmic domain to initiate signaling pathways that regulate apoptosis, tumorigenesis, viral replication, etc. (15McWhirter S.M.

TNF-mediated signaling thus has become a prominent target for therapeutic intervention. Interaction of TNFR1 with TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) and TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor 2) leads to activation of NF-κB and cell death (16Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar, 17Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Although interaction of TRAF2 with TANK (TRAF for NF-κB) leads to activation of IκBα kinases (IKKs) via NF-κB-inducing kinase, followed by NF-κB activation (18Chin A.I. Shu J. Shan Shi C. Yao Z. Kehrl J.H. Cheng G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6665-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interaction of TRAF2 with TANK also activates JNK (18Chin A.I. Shu J. Shan Shi C. Yao Z. Kehrl J.H. Cheng G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6665-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interaction of TRAF2 with MEKK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1) has been shown to activate JNK and AP-1 (19Chadee D.N. Yuasa T. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interaction of TRAF2 with MEKK1 activates not only the JNK but also IKKβ via recruitment of receptor-interacting protein (20Kim J.W. Joe C.O. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27064-27070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The thiazolidones have drawn considerable attention for their anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-inflammatory activities. Newer derivatives of 1,2,4-thiadiazolidines, including 3-oxo-1,2,4-thiadiazolidines, were synthesized, and biological effects were studied (21Manna P. Singh R. Narang K.K. Manna S.K. Ind. J. Heterocycl. Chem. 2004; 13: 249-252Google Scholar, 22Manna P. Narang K.K. Manna S.K. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 113: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 5-(4-Methoxyarylimino)-2-N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-oxo-1,2,4-thiadiazolidine (P3-25) has been shown to inhibit TNF-induced cell signaling (22Manna P. Narang K.K. Manna S.K. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 113: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We investigated the binding affinities of P3-25 and structurally similar 5-aryl thiazolidine-2,4-diones (5-aryl TZD) with TRADD-TRAF2, TRAF2‐TANK, and TRAF2-MEKK1 complexes in silico by an advanced docking program, AutoDock4 (23Morris G.M.

The selective inhibition of interacting molecules is becoming a promising approach of this class of anti-tumor or anti-inflammatory agents. In this report, for the first time, we provide evidence that the dimethyl form of 1,2,4-thiadiazolidine (P3-25) interacts with TRAF2‐TANK and thereby prevents NF-κB activity and inhibits downstream signaling. P3-25 facilitated AP-1 activation via TRAF2-MEKK1 interaction, which might explain the regulated cell cycle through AP-1-mediated gene expression. The twin effects of P3-25 would contribute to the therapeutic value of inhibition of TNF-mediated signaling as well as high basal expressed tumor cells. Overall, multiple effects of P3-25 to block NF-κB completely might cut the life line of tumor cells by blocking excessive proliferation and metastasis and thereby regulate proliferation through AP-1 activation. By bypassing several side effects due to complete NF-κB inhibition, P3-25 might prove to be a safe molecule as a chemotherapeutic drug. Glycine, 4-methyl umbelliferyl phosphate, Sepharose 4B, cyanogen bromide, and anti-tubulin antibody were obtained from Sigma. 5-aryl TZD was obtained from Merck. Penicillin, streptomycin, neomycin, RPMI 1640 medium, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Antibodies against IKKα, IKKβ, JNK, TRADD, TRAF2, MEKK1, and TANK and double-stranded AP-1 oligonucleotides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody against phospho-JNK was obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Danvers, MA). Recombinant IL-8 and TNF were purchased from Peprotech. Plasmids for NF-κB-SEAP, AP-1-luciferase, TRAF2, TRADD, TRAF2-DN, TRADD-DN, and GFP were kindly supplied by Prof. B. B. Aggarwal (University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX)). The P3-25 was prepared from 1-(4-methoxyaryl)thiocarbamide as described previously (21Manna P. Singh R. Narang K.K. Manna S.K. Ind. J. Heterocycl. Chem. 2004; 13: 249-252Google Scholar, 22Manna P. Narang K.K. Manna S.K. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 113: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (also see supplemental Fig. 1A for a flow chart of the synthesis of thiadiazolidine, supplemental Fig. 1B for modification of side groups, and supplemental Fig. 1C for the structure of P3-25). The cell lines used in this study were Jurkat (T-cell) and HuT-78 (modified T-cell) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). P3-25 was chemically synthesized as described previously (21Manna P. Singh R. Narang K.K. Manna S.K. Ind. J. Heterocycl. Chem. 2004; 13: 249-252Google Scholar). A stock solution of 10 mm in DMSO was prepared and added to the cell culture medium to give the mentioned concentrations. Culture supernatant from HuT-78 cells, treated with 100 nm P3-25 for 0, 12, and 24 h, when assayed for lactate dehydrogenase activity by incubating with substrate solution (23 mm sodium pyruvate and 0.05 mm NADH in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.5), showed 1.22 ± 0.08, 1.18 ± 0.09, and 1.16 ± 0.078 absorbance, respectively, at 340 nm, indicating little cytolysis during incubation with the compound. DNA binding of AP-1 and NF-κB was determined by gel shift assay (24Manna S.K. Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13245-13254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were subjected to different treatments as described, and cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared. Nuclear extract (8 μg of protein) was incubated with 32P-end-labeled double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide of HIV-LTR, 5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′, for 30 min at 37 °C, and the DNA-protein complex was separated from free oligonucleotide on 6.6% native PAGE. AP-1 DNA binding was assayed similarly using specific double-stranded labeled oligonucleotide. Visualization of radioactive bands was done in a phosphor imager (Fuji, Japan). Cells were transiently transfected with Qiagen SuperFect transfection reagent (Hilden, Germany) with reporter plasmid containing the NF-κB binding site cloned upstream of heat-stable SEAP, designated as NF-κB-SEAP and GFP (0.5 μg each) constructs, for 3 h and cultured for 12 h. GFP-positive cells were counted and evaluated for transfection efficiency. These cells were treated with P3-25 for different time periods. Cell culture-conditioned medium (25 μl) was analyzed for SEAP activity essentially as per the Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) protocol, and results are reported as -fold activation with respect to vector-transected cells as described previously (25Sarkar A. Sreenivasan Y. Ramesh G.T. Manna S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33768-33781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The expression of the AP-1-dependent luciferase reporter gene was carried out as described previously (26Manna S.K. Ramesh G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7010-7021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cells, transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid containing an AP-1 binding site cloned upstream of luciferase (designated as AP-1-luciferase) and GFP constructs, were washed and cultured for 12 h, followed by treatment with P3-25 for different time periods. The cell pellets were extracted with lysis buffer (part of the luciferase assay kit from Promega), and the extracts were incubated with the firefly luciferin substrate (Promega). Light emission was monitored with a Luminometer, and values were calculated as -fold activation over vector-transfected value. Sepharose 4B beads were coupled with anti-TRAF2 or anti‐TANK antibody by cyanogen bromide. HuT-78 cells were transfected with vector, TRAF2, or TRAF2-DN constructs for 3 h and then cultured for 12 h. Cells were treated with 100 nm P3-25 for 12 h. Cells extracts were prepared and precleared with IgG, followed by removal by protein A-Sepharose beads and incubation with antibody-coupled beads for 6 h. The column was prepared with these beads and washed and eluted with high salt solution. Elutes were used to measure the amounts of TRAF2, TANK, and MEKK1 by Western blot. The IKK and JNK assays were performed by a method described previously (25Sarkar A. Sreenivasan Y. Ramesh G.T. Manna S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33768-33781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, IKK complex or JNK from whole-cell extract (300 μg) was precipitated with anti-IKKα and anti-IKKβ or anti-JNK antibodies (1 μg each), followed by incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce). After a 2-h incubation, the beads were washed with lysis buffer and assayed for IKK or JNK activity using 2 μg of GST-IκBα (amino acids 1–54) or GST-Jun (amino acids 1–100) as substrate proteins, respectively. For docking experiments with the AutoDock 4 suite of programs, ligand molecules P3-25 and 5-aryl TZD were drawn, optimized, and saved in the mol2 format with the aid of Hyperchem programs. Full hydrogens were added to the ligands, and Gasteiger partial atomic charges were computed using the VEGA program in the required format (27Gasteiger J. Marsili M. Tetrahedron. 1980; 36: 3219-3228Crossref Scopus (3626) Google Scholar, 28Pedretti A. Villa L. Vistoli G. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2002; 21: 47-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of TRADD in the bound state with TRAF2 was taken from the Protein Data Bank (29Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J. Meyer Jr., E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8182) Google Scholar) (accession number 1FV3) (30Park Y.C. Ye H. Hsia C. Segal D. Rich R.L. Liou H.C. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Cell. 2000; 101: 777-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For the building of the complex structure of TRAF2 with TANK or MEKK1, the crystal structures of TANK or MEKK1 co-ordinates were inserted into the experimental model of TRAF2. All bound waters, polar hydrogens, and the Kollman-united charges were added to the proteins. Protein pockets and cavities were located and measured using the program CastP Server (31Binkowski T.A. Naghibzadeh S. Liang J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3352-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). AutoDock requires a precalculated electrostatic grid map for each atom type present in the complex molecules. Affinity (grid) maps of 150 × 150 × 200 grid points and 0.375 Å (roughly a quarter of the length of a carbon-carbon single bond) spacing between grid points were utilized. The grids (one for each atom type in the ligand plus one for electrostatic interactions) were generated using the Autogrid program, and maps were centered on the protein center. AutoDock parameter set and distance-dependent dielectric functions were used in the calculation of the van der Waals and the electrostatic terms, respectively. Docking simulations were performed using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm and the Solis and Wets local search method (30Park Y.C. Ye H. Hsia C. Segal D. Rich R.L. Liou H.C. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Cell. 2000; 101: 777-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Initial position, orientation, and torsions of the ligand molecules were set randomly. All rotatable torsions were released during docking. Each docking experiment was derived from 100 different runs that were set to terminate after a maximum of 2,500,000 energy evaluations. The population size was set to 250. During the search, a translational step of 0.2 Å, and quaternion and torsion steps of 5 were applied. Binding free energies of each job were collected, and the first rank results were selected. The clusters were ranked by the lowest energy representative of each bunch. All calculations were carried out on PC-based machines running Linux x 64 as the operating system. The resultant structure files were analyzed using PyMOL visualization programs (available on the World Wide Web). Binding sites of these complexes were identified as described previously (31Binkowski T.A. Naghibzadeh S. Liang J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3352-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The conformation of the binding site was constructed manually to dock P3-25 and 5-aryl TZD. The validation of the docking accuracy was done by docking of the native co-crystallized P3-25 5-(4-methoxyarylimino)-2-N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-oxo-1,2,4-thiadiazolidine and 5-aryl TZD into its binding site of TRADD-TRAF2, TRAF2‐TANK, and TRAF2-MEKK1. The binding affinities of P3-25 and 5-aryl TZD with TRADD-TRAF2, TRAF2‐TANK, and TRAF2-MEKK1 complexes were evaluated by the binding free energies (ΔGb, kcal/mol), inhibition constants (Ki), hydrogen bonds, and r.m.s. deviation values. Cluster analysis or “structure binning” superimposes each final ligand structure with each other structure and measures the r.m.s. deviation between each atom pair. Structures that have an r.m.s. deviation lower than rmstol (listed in ligand.dpf) are automatically assumed to be similar; structures that have an r.m.s. deviation greater than rmstol are assumed to be different. This determines if different families of structures have been produced from multiple runs. Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Statistical analyses of the samples were done by Student's t test wherever applicable. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. In this study, we examined the effect of P3-25 in regulation of DNA binding activity of NF-κB and AP-1 in the HuT-78 cell line with constitutive activity of NF-κB and AP-1 and Jurkat T-cells. Jurkat and HuT-78 cells were treated with P3-25 (100 nm) for different times, and then DNA binding to NF-κB was measured by a gel shift assay. P3-25 treatment did not alter the amount of DNA bound to NF-κB in these cells. HuT-78 cells showed high basal DNA binding to NF-κB (Fig. 1A1). A decrease in the high basal activity (3.8-fold, p < 0.001) of the NF-κB-dependent SEAP was observed in NF-κB promoter-driven SEAP construct (NF-κB-SEAP)-transfected HuT-78 cells (Fig. 1A2). The amount of DNA binding to AP-1 was enhanced in Jurkat cells with increasing time of P3-25 treatment, whereas the high basal DNA binding to AP-1 (5.2-fold, p < 0.005) remained unaltered upon P3-25 treatment in HuT-78 cells (Fig. 1B1). The activity of AP-1-dependent luciferase increased upon P3-25 treatment in both Jurkat and HuT-78 cells (Fig. 1B2). These results suggest that P3-25 treatment inhibited NF-κB activity and enhanced AP-1 activation. The basal activity of IKK in Jurkat and HuT-78 cells was unaltered with increasing time of P3-25 treatment (Fig. 1C). The basal activity of JNK in both Jurkat (1-fold, p < 0.001) and HuT-78 (4.2-fold, p < 0.005) cells increased with increasing time of P3-25 treatment as shown by Western blot and in vitro JNK assay data (Fig. 1D), as expected of activation of AP-1 and inhibition of NF-κB. The high basal SEAP activity in HuT-78 cells (5.8-fold, p < 0.005) decreased in a time-dependent manner of P3-25 treatment (Fig. 1E). The related compound, 5-aryl TZD, was ineffective under these conditions. These results suggest that P3-25 specifically blocks NF-κB-dependent gene expression. TNF-induced but not IL-8-induced NF-κB-DNA binding decreased in the nuclear extract with increasing time of P3-25 treatment of the Jurkat cells (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, activity of SEAP (NF-κB-dependent reporter gene) was inhibited with increasing time of P3-25 treatment under these conditions (Fig. 2B). TNF- or IL-8-induced PKAα activity (4- and 5.8-fold, respectively, with p < 0.005) was inhibited by P3-25 treatment as detected by an in vitro kinase assay using GST-p65 as substrate protein (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that NF-κB activation induced by IL-8 differs from that of TNF. P3-25 inhibits p65 phosphorylation by inhibiting activity of PKAα and thereby inhibits NF-κB-dependent gene transcription as reported earlier (10Manna S.K. Manna P. Sarkar A. Cell. Death Differ. 2007; 14: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Manna S.K. Gangadharan C. Mol. Immunol. 2009; 46: 1340-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The effect of P3-25 on TRAF6-induced NF-κB activation was next studied because IL-8 is known to predominantly activate NF-κB by recruiting TRAF6 (26Manna S.K. Ramesh G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7010-7021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with TRAF2 and also TRAF6 showed higher NF-κB-DNA binding (4.4- and 3.6-fold, respectively, with p < 0.001). Treatment of P3-25 showed a decrease in NF-κB DNA binding in TRAF2-transfected but not in TRAF6-transfected or TRAF2- and TRAF6-co-transfected cells (Fig. 3A1). NF-κB-dependent expression of the SEAP gene decreased in all of these transfection conditions upon P3-25 treatment (Fig. 3A2). P3-25 treatment decreased IKK activity in a time-dependent manner in TRAF2-transfected but not in TRAF6-transfected cells (Fig. 3C), suggesting that P3-25 interfered with TRAF2-mediated signaling upstream of IKK. P3-25 induced AP-1-DNA binding activity in vector-transfected cells, and this remained unaltered in TRAF2-transfected, TRAF6-transfected, or TRAF2- and TRAF6-transfected cells (Fig. 3B1). However, P3-25 treatment increased AP-1-dependent luciferase activity in vector-transfected, TRAF2-transfected, TRAF6-transfected, or TRAF2- and TRAF6-transfected cells (Fig. 3B2). These results indicate that interaction of P3-25 with TRAF2 leads to activation of AP-1. High basal activity of JNK in TRAF2-transfected (4.2-fold, p < 0.005) or TRAF6-transfected (3.4-fold, p < 0.005) cells was enhanced further by P3-25 treatment in a time-dependent manner, as shown by an in vitro JNK assay, which was further supported by Western blot data using anti-phospho-JNK antibody (Fig. 3D). These data further suggest AP-1 activation upon P3-25 treatment through JNK activation via the TRAF2 and TRAF6 pathway. High basal expression of NF-κB progressively decreased in vector-transfected HuT-78 cells upon P3-25 treatment kinetically. The basal expression of NF-κB decreased in TRAF2-DN- or TRADD-DN-transfected HuT-78 cells, and P3-25 treatment had no further effect on this at any time of treatment (supplemental Fig. 2A1). Similarly, P3-25 treatment had no effect on the changes of the NF-κB-dependent reporter gene SEAP activity in NF-κB-SEAP-transfected cells (supplemental Fig. 2A2). Treatment of P3-25 in TRAF2-DN- or TRADD-DN-transfected cells decreased high basal amount of AP-1 DNA binding (supplemental Fig. 2B1) and AP-1-dependent luciferase activity (supplemental Fig. 2B2). These data suggest that TRAF2 and TRADD are required for P3-25-mediated AP-1 activation as well as NF-κB inhibition. High basal activity of IKK decreased in TRADD-DN or TRAF2-DN HuT-78 cells, and this remained unaltered with P3-25 treatment with time in both of these transfected cells (supplemental Fig. 2C). The basal activity of JNK, measured by the amount of phospho-JNK, was further increased with increasing time of P3-25 treatment. TRADD-DN or TRAF2-DN transfection decreased the basal amount of phospho-JNK, and P3-25 treatment of these cells had no effect on these values at any time of treatment (supplemental Fig. 2D). These data further support the role of TRADD and TRAF2 in P3-25-mediated cell signaling. TRAF2 interacts with TANK (TNF receptor-associated factor for NF-κB) and MEKK1 (18Chin A.I. Shu J. Shan Shi C. Yao Z. Kehrl J.H. Cheng G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6665-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When TRAF2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-TRAF2 antibody from TRAF2-DN-transfected HuT-78 cells, the amount of MEKK1 or TANK was undetected as shown by Western blot. TRAF2 interacted with MEKK1 and TANK as shown by a Western blot from a fraction immunoprecipitated against anti-TRAF2 antibody of TRAF2- or vector-transfected HuT-78 cell extract. P3-25 treatment inhibited interaction of TRAF2 with TANK but not with MEKK1 (Fig. 4A). P3-25 treatment showed the inhibition of TRAF2 and TANK interaction in vector- or TRAF2-transfected HuT-78 cells, as shown by Western blot from the immunoprecipitated fraction by anti‐TANK antibody. The amount of MEKK1 decreased in vector- or TRAF2-transfected HuT-78 cell extracts upon P3-25 treatment (Fig. 4B). In TRAF2-DN-transfected cells, the amounts of both MEKK1 and TRAF2 were not detected in immunoprecipitated fractions with anti‐TANK antibody. These data further indicate that TRAF2 interacts with TANK and MEKK1 and that P3-25 inhibits TRAF2 and TANK interaction. The binding affinities of P3-25 with TRAF2 and TRAF6 were evaluated by the binding free energies (ΔGb, kcal/mol), inhibition constants (Ki), hydrogen bonds, and r.m.s. deviation values. The predicted binding sites for TRAF2 and TRAF6 with P3-25 are shown in Fig. 5A. P3-25 mostly binds with positive charged basic amino acid residues and the predicted active sites of TRAF2 and TRAF6 (Fig. 5B). The different surface pocket for residues seems to be an important factor in determining the different mode of P3-25 interaction with TRAF2 and TRAF6, where the P3-25 binds with Arg393, Phe447, and Asp399 of TRAF2 and Arg392, Lys469, and Gly470 of TRAF6 (Fig. 5B). The binding free energies of these residues, calculated based on their best docking scores, are −18.43 kcal/mol and −11.21 kcal/mol for TRAF2 and TRAF6, respectively (Table 1). The difference between the lowest binding interaction of TRAF2 and TRAF6 with P3-25 is shown in Fig. 5C. It revealed the energy difference and cluster runs of the TRAFs. From the above results, it is clear that P3-25 interferes with TRAF2 action more efficiently than with that of TRAF6.TABLE 1Energy values of TRAF2 and TRAF6 with P3-25ProteinCluster rankCluster runClusteraThe best clusters of a total 100 runs are shown.r.m.s. deviationbThe geometry fit was measured by r.m.s. deviation of angles, r.m.s. deviation = (Σαi − αideal)2/n)1/2, where αi is the measured angle, αideal is the angle in ideal coordination geometry, and n is the total number of angles of the corresponding geometry.Lowest energycValue for the optimal structure in the cluster.Free energy (ΔG)Inhibition constant (Ki)kcal/molTRAF2 (1LB4)11610.00−18.43−18.57+1.82e−132210.00−17.10−17.29+2.10e−133410.00−16.63−16.85+4.45e−1342720.00−16.49−16.53+7.67e−1352210.20−16.28−16.47+8.43e−13TRAF6 (1CA4)19810.75−11.21−11.35+3.77e−828221.25−11.03−11.16+3.02e−834510.23−10.78−10.89+5.45e−841510.00−10.43−10.52+7.55e−85320.48−10.11−10.18+8.13e−8a The best clusters of a total 100 runs are shown.b The geometry fit was measured by r.m.s. deviation of angles, r.m.s. deviation = (Σαi − αideal)2/n)1/2, where αi is the measured angle, αideal is the angle in ideal coordination geometry, and n is the total number of angles of the corresponding geometry.c Value for the optimal structure in the cluster. Open table in a new tab TRADD-TRAF2, TRAF2‐TANK, and TRAF2-MEKK1 binding sites were identified as described previously (31Binkowski T.A. Naghibzadeh S. Liang J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3352-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), and predicted binding sites of P3-25 and 5-aryl TZD with these complexes were shown by surface binding in Fig. 6, A1, B1, and C1, respectively. The complex of TRADD-TRAF2 formed a hydrogen bond with P3-25 and 5-aryl TZD (Fig. 6A2) with binding free energy of −11.35 and −11.55 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 2, top) suggesting weak interaction for both. The benzene ring of P3-25 is surrounded by hydrophobic residues (Ala466, Ser467, Tyr395, and Gly400), and they formed hydrophic interactions in the TRAF2‐TANK complex. In addition, the two oxygen atoms of the benzene ring of P3-25 formed three hydrogen bonds with Arg393, Phe447, and Asp399. The 5-aryl TZD formed hydrogen bonds with Arg392, Lys446, and Gly470 of the TRAF2‐TANK complex (Fig. 6B2). The energies of these residues for TRAF2‐TANK are −18.43 and −15.43 kcal/mol for P3-25 and 5-aryl TZD, respectively (Table 2, middle) suggesting that P3-25 has higher binding affinity than 5-aryl TZD for forming TRAF2‐TANK complex. The TRAF2-MEKK1 electrostatic potential surface showed the possible docking interaction with P3-25 and 5-aryl TZD (Fig. 6C1). P3-25 formed a single hydrogen bond with the active site Lys192 residue of the TRAF2-MEKK1 complex (Fig. 6C2). It showed the lowest binding energy (−4.89 kcal/mol). The 5-aryl TZD showed the lowest binding energy (+157.21 kcal/mol) with residues in the TRAF2-MEKK1 complex (Table 2, bottom) suggesting no interaction. The docking of the complex of TRAF2-MEKK1 with P3-25 showed fewer interactions compared with TRAF2‐TANK or TRADD-TRAF2 complex. The above results revealed that synthetic P3-25 molecule more potently complexes with TRAF2‐TANK than 5-aryl TZD (Fig. 6D), supporting the experimental studies obtained.TABLE 2Energy values for the docking interaction of TRADD-TRAF2, TRAF2‐TANK, and TRAF2-MEKK1 with P3-25 and 5-aryl TZDProtein complexLigandCluster rankClusteraThe best clusters of a total 100 runs are shown.r.m.s. deviationbThe geometry fit was measured by r.m.s. deviation of angles. r.m.s. deviation = (Σai − αideal)2/n)1/2, where αi is the measured angle, αideal is the angle in ideal coordination geometry, and n is the total number of angles of the corresponding geometry.Lowest energy (kcal/mol)cValue for the optimal structure in the cluster.Free energy (ΔG)Inhibition constant (Ki)d5-Aryl TZD lacks binding ability with the TRAF2-MEKK1 complex, which gives a negligible value of the inhibition constant (Ki) compared with other ligands.TRADD-TRAF2P3-25110.75−11.21−11.35+3.77e−8211.25−11.03−11.16+3.02e−8310.23−10.78−10.89+5.45e−8420.00−10.43−10.52+7.55e−8510.48−10.11−10.18+8.13e−8TRADD-TRAF25-Aryl TZD110.56−11.43−11.55+7.87e−8211.00−10.53−10.66+8.07e−8310.00−10.48−10.59+8.55e−8420.00009.83−9.92+9.45e−8510.02−8.71−8.98+9.83e−8TRAF2‐TANKP3-25110.00−18.43−18.48+1.82e−8220.00−17.10−17.29+2.10e−8310.00−16.63−16.85+4.45e−8410.00−16.53−16.53+7.67e−8520.20−16.28−16.47+8.43e−8TRAF2‐TANK5-Aryl TZD110.10−15.43−15.48+1.52e−8220.20−14.10−14.39+1.98e−8310.32−13.73−13.95+3.45e−8410.0112.80−12.93+5.67e−8520.20−12.28−12.57+6.03e−8TRAF2-MEKK1P3-25140.23−4.89−4.92+2.59e−8211.88−4.85−4.88+2.77e−8331.89−4.60−4.64+4.60e−8422.56−4.58−4.60+4.23e−8520.54−4.40−4.38+4.88e−8TRAF2-MEKK15-Aryl TZD120.00+157.21+159.80+0.004e−8210.24+154.78+156.78+0.004e−8330.80+140.58+142.56+0.003e−8420.00+140.22+142.30+0.003e−8530.06+135.26+135.87+0.002e−8a The best clusters of a total 100 runs are shown.b The geometry fit was measured by r.m.s. deviation of angles. r.m.s. deviation = (Σai − αideal)2/n)1/2, where αi is the measured angle, αideal is the angle in ideal coordination geometry, and n is the total number of angles of the corresponding geometry.c Value for the optimal structure in the cluster.d 5-Aryl TZD lacks binding ability with the TRAF2-MEKK1 complex, which gives a negligible value of the inhibition constant (Ki) compared with other ligands. Open table in a new tab The present study demonstrated that the dichlorophenyl derivative of 1,2,4-thiadiazolidine (P3-25) decreases NF-κB activation and enhances AP-1 activation by interacting with TRAF2. It did not inhibit IL-8- or TRAF6-induced NF-κB DNA binding but inhibited NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression. IL-8-mediated NF-κB activation requires recruitment of TRAF6 (26Manna S.K. Ramesh G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7010-7021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We did not observe TRAF6- or IL-8-induced inhibition of IKK activity. P3-25 inhibited dependent gene expression of NF-κB in cells irrespective of inducers of NF-κB, overexpression of upstream molecules, such as TRAFs, or having constitutive NF-κB expression. This is in complete agreement with our previous report on P3-25 blocking expression of NF-κB-dependent genes through inhibition of p65 phosphorylation (10Manna S.K. Manna P. Sarkar A. Cell. Death Differ. 2007; 14: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). TNF signals through recruitment of TRAF2 and IKKs via TANK. TNF-induced activation of IKKs was not observed upon P3-25 treatment, which was reflected in inhibition of NF-κB, supporting our previous observation (21Manna P. Singh R. Narang K.K. Manna S.K. Ind. J. Heterocycl. Chem. 2004; 13: 249-252Google Scholar). This suggests that the effect of P3-25 lies on TRAF2, but not on IKK. TRAF2 interacts with TANK and MEKK1 (18Chin A.I. Shu J. Shan Shi C. Yao Z. Kehrl J.H. Cheng G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6665-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). P3-25 treatment inhibited TANK interaction with TRAF2, which was supported by a pull-down assay as well as AutoDock evidence. P3-25 did not interfere with TRAF2-MEKK1 interaction. TRAF2‐TANK interaction has been shown to induce JNK and AP-1 (18Chin A.I. Shu J. Shan Shi C. Yao Z. Kehrl J.H. Cheng G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6665-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although we observed JNK activation, which may be independent of TRAF2‐TANK interaction, in silico data also suggest that P3-25 interferes with TRAF2‐TANK but not TRADD-TRAF2 or TRAF2-MEKK1 interactions. AutoDock evidence and the values of lowest binding energy suggest that the binding affinity of P3-25 with the TRAF2‐TANK complex is stronger than the TRADD-TRAF2 or TRAF2-MEKK1 complex. The 5-aryl thiazolidine-2,4-diones, structurally similar to P3-25, having the same backbone, does not interact with TRAF2-MEKK1 at all and weakly interact with TRADD-TRAF2 or TRAF2‐TANK. The strong binding ability of P3-25 with the TRAF2‐TANK complex hinders the recruitment and activation of IKKs, the immediate molecules of such interaction. P3-25 is also known to inhibit p65 phosphorylation by blocking upstream kinases, casein kinase 2 and protein kinase A (10Manna S.K. Manna P. Sarkar A. Cell. Death Differ. 2007; 14: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The double sword effect of P3-25 on inhibition of NF-κB might be important for the potential therapeutic value of P3-25 in NF-κB-driven inflammatory and tumorigenic responses. Although P3-25 induces AP-1 by facilitating MEKK1 recruitment with TRAF2 followed by JNK activation, as shown in the schematic diagram in Fig. 7, the AP-1-mediated signaling may be less responsible for such responses than NF-κB. NF-κB and AP-1 regulate cell cycle in embryonic development and body growth. Excessive activation of these transcription factors results in inflammatory response and rapid cell cycle progression, the hallmark of tumorigenesis. Regulation of these transcription factors is required to control inflammatory diseases and cancer metastasis. Predominantly enhanced NF-κB activation through p65 phosphorylation and acetylation via recruitment of several cofactors is a prerequisite for the severalfold NF-κB-mediated transcription of genes required for tumorigenesis and tumor metastasis. Knock-out of NF-κB has several deleterious effects and is even lethal for embryo. Even T-cell-mediated apoptosis of dendritic cells has been shown to be inhibited through JNK-AP-1 activation when signaling mediated by TNF receptor superfamily members was ligated (33Kriehuber E. Bauer W. Charbonnier A.S. Winter D. Amatschek S. Tamandl D. Schweifer N. Stingl G. Maurer D. Blood. 2005; 106: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, deregulation of NF-κB function, while allowing AP-1 activation to progress regulated cell division through the interaction of P3-25 with TRAF2, would be ideal for many reasons. AP-1 is a mild transcription factor and is mostly involved in regulated cell cycle progression. Initially, it was considered to be a housekeeping transcription factor. In this report, for the first time we provide evidence that P3-25, a synthetic derivative, interacts with TRAF2 in such a manner that recruitment of TANK is completely inhibited and thereby inhibits recruitment of IKKs. Thus, P3-25 is inhibiting IκBα degradation, thereby arresting NF-κB in cytoplasm. Although TRAF6- or IL-8-mediated IKKs activation is unaffected by P3-25 treatment, it blocks NF-κB-dependent gene transcription by inhibiting p65 phosphorylation. Thus, the double sword mechanisms of P3-25 action are shutting down NF-κB functions completely (Fig. 7). Although P3-25 binding with TRAF2 inhibited TANK binding, it facilitated binding with MEKK1 required for AP-1 activation via JNK. Thus, P3-25 is allowing AP-1 activation. However, P3-25 would be an important drug target by blocking NF-κB action totally but allowing AP-mediated cell signaling to regulate inflammatory and tumorigenic responses without compromising its regulated cell growth. Thus, P3-25 might be a safe molecule as a potential chemotherapeutic drug by avoiding several side effects otherwise obtained upon complete inhibition of NF-κB and anticipating the function of NF-κB by activation of AP-1 in a regulated fashion.

https://openalex.org/W2058409486,"GA binding protein (GABP) consists of GABPα and GABPβ subunits. GABPα is a member of Ets family transcription factors and binds DNA via its conserved Ets domain, whereas GABPβ does not bind DNA but possesses transactivation activity. In T cells, GABP has been demonstrated to regulate the gene expression of interleukin-7 receptor α chain (IL-7Rα) and postulated to be critical in T cell development. To directly investigate its function in early thymocyte development, we used GABPα conditional knock-out mice where the exons encoding the Ets DNA-binding domain are flanked with LoxP sites. Ablation of GABPα with the Lck-Cre transgene greatly diminished thymic cellularity, blocked thymocyte development at the double negative 3 (DN3) stage, and resulted in reduced expression of T cell receptor (TCR) β chain in DN4 thymocytes. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated in DN thymocytes that GABPα is associated with transcription initiation sites of genes encoding key molecules in TCR rearrangements. Among these GABP-associated genes, knockdown of GABPα expression by RNA interference diminished expression of DNA ligase IV, Artemis, and Ku80 components in DNA-dependent protein kinase complex. Interestingly, forced expression of prearranged TCR but not IL-7Rα can alleviate the DN3 block in GABPα-targeted mice. Our observations collectively indicate that in addition to regulating IL-7Rα expression, GABP is critically required for TCR rearrangements and hence normal T cell development.

T cells are derived from multipotent lymphoid progenitors in the bone marrow and differentiate into mature T cells as a result of a series of lineage commitment steps occurring in the thymus and periphery (1.Bhandoola A. von Boehmer H.

The co-receptor molecules CD4 and CD8 can be used to distinguish four different populations of developing thymocytes, with the most immature thymocytes being double negative for CD4 and CD8 expression (termed DN thymocytes). 2The abbreviations used are: DNdouble negativeDPdouble positiveSPsingle positiveGABPGA binding proteinIL-7Rαinterleukin-7 receptor α chainTCRT cell receptorHSChematopoietic stem cellsChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationTIStranscription initiation siteDNA-PKDNA-dependent protein kinaseEYFPenhanced yellow fluorescent proteinSISSRsSite Identification from Short Sequence ReadssiGABPαsmall interference RNA constructs targeting GABPαWTwild typeDSBdouble-strand break. DN cells then become double positive (DP) thymocytes expressing both CD4 and CD8 that undergo vigorous positive and negative selections, with subsequent differentiation into single positive (SP) thymocytes expressing either CD4 or CD8. The SP thymocytes leave the thymus and populate peripheral lymphoid organs, where they can be activated upon encountering foreign antigens. During their early developmental stages, DN thymocytes can be subdivided further into four sequential stages of differentiation, which are identified by their surface expression of CD44 and CD25: DN1 (CD44+CD25−), DN2 (CD44+CD25+), DN3 (CD44−CD25+), and DN4 (CD44−CD25−). Both DN1 and DN2 subsets retain the potential to become natural killer cells and dendritic cells, and complete commitment of early thymocytes to the T cell lineage occurs at the DN3 stage (3.Rothenberg E.V. Moore J.E. Yui M.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Rearrangement of T cell receptor β (TCRβ) locus is initiated in DN3 thymocytes, and productive recombination and proper expression of TCRβ form a major checkpoint known as β-selection. At this selection stage, TCRβ pairs with pre-Tα chain and forms pre-TCR.

Successful commitment and further development of T lineage cells are orchestrated by a number of transcription factors, as revealed by germ line and conditional gene knock-out experiments. These includes Ikaros family factors, the “E proteins” E2A and HEB, Runx family factors, TCF family transcription factors activated by Wnt signaling, RBPSuh activated by Notch-Delta interaction, GATA-3, Myb, Gfi-1, and the Ets family transcription factor PU.1 (2.Rothenberg E.V. Taghon T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 601-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 3.Rothenberg E.V. Moore J.E. Yui M.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Ikaros family factors and PU.1 are critical in specifying hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to lymphoid lineages (4.Scott E.W. Simon M.C. Anastasi J. Singh H. Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar, 5.Georgopoulos K. Nat. Rev.

Notch molecules and their direct transcriptional effector RBPSuh as well as E2A and HEB and their antagonists Id2 and Id3 have critical roles in establishing T cell identity and affecting successive T-lineage subspecializations (6.Maillard I. Fang T. Pear W.S. Annu Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 945-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 7.Robey E.A. Bluestone J.A. Curr. Opin.

The T cell-specific transcription factors GATA3 and TCF-1 have nonredundant roles at multiple stages during T cell development (9.Staal F.J. Clevers H.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 10.Pai S.Y. Truitt M.L. Ting C.N. Leiden J.M. Glimcher L.H. Ho I.C. Immunity. 2003; 19: 863-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In addition to PU.1, other Ets factors, including Ets-1, Fli-1, Tel, Elf-1, and GA binding protein (GABP), are expressed throughout most stages of T cell development (11.David-Fung E.S. Butler R. Buzi G. Yui M.A. Diamond R.A. Anderson M.K. Rowen L. Rothenberg E.V. Dev. Biol. 2009; 325: 444-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Ets factor functions may be partially redundant; for example, no lymphoid developmental phenotype has been observed in Elf-1 knock-out mice even though Elf-1 has been shown to bind to immunologically important genes (12.Garrett-Sinha L.A. Dahl R. Rao S. Barton K.P. Simon M.C. Blood. 2001; 97: 2908-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Among more than 30 Ets factors, GABP is the only one that functions as a heterodimer of GABPα and GABPβ (13.Rosmarin A.G. Resendes K.K. Yang Z. McMillan J.N. Fleming S.L. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2004; 32: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). GABPα contains the DNA-binding Ets domain that is conserved among all Ets factors, whereas GABPβ cannot bind DNA but has transactivation activities. GABP proteins are ubiquitously expressed and known to regulate genes that control basic cellular functions such as cell cycle progression (14.Yang Z.F. Mott S. Rosmarin A.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15.Crook M.F. Olive M. Xue H.H. Langenickel T.H. Boehm M. Leonard W.J. Nabel E.G. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GABP also participates in the regulation of tissue/cell type-specific genes, such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits δ and ϵ in neuromuscular synapses (16.O'Leary D.A. Noakes P.G. Lavidis N.A. Kola I. Hertzog P.J. Ristevski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3470-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and CD18 in myeloid cells (13.Rosmarin A.G. Resendes K.K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13097-13103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the immune system, we have demonstrated that GABP is critically required for normal expression of Pax5 and thus B cell development and that diminished GABPα expression causes severe defects in humoral responses (18.Xue H.H.

In T cells, GABP is critical for the expression of IL-7 receptor α chain (IL-7Rα) (19.Xue H.H. Bollenbacher J. Rovella V. Tripuraneni R. Du Y.B. Liu C.Y. Williams A. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because IL-7Rα is indispensable for T cell development, survival, and homeostasis of naïve T cells, as well as for the maintenance and possibly the generation of memory T cells (20.Bradley L.M. Haynes L. Swain S.L. Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 172-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), ablation of GABP is postulated to have profound impact on multiple aspects in T cell biology. In this report, we investigated the roles of GABP in T cell development by targeting the GABPα subunit in developing thymocytes. GABPαFL/+ and GABPα+/− mice were kindly provided by Dr. Steven Burden (Skirball Institute, New York University Medical School) (21.Jaworski A. Smith C.L. Burden S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5040-5046Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The targeting strategy was summarized in Fig. 1A, and the genotyping primers are as follows: Acondi1, 5′-cagccaagagcaacagatgaatg; Acondi2, 5′-tagtttgcattacaaagatgctg; and Acondi3, 5′-ccaaaggaattaggggaatctttcc. Lck-Cre transgenic mice were from Taconic, and OT-I TCR transgenic mice were from The Jackson Laboratory. IL-7Rα transgenic mice were previously described (22.Haring J.S. Jing X. Bollenbacher-Reilley J. Xue H.H. Leonard W.J. Harty J.T. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All of the mice were handled in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee of the University of Iowa. Single cell suspensions were prepared from thymi and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies, as described (19.Xue H.H. Bollenbacher J. Rovella V. Tripuraneni R. Du Y.B. Liu C.Y. Williams A. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies were from either eBiosciences or BD Biosciences. For intracellular staining, the cells were sequentially surface-stained, fixed, and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences), followed by staining with anti-TCRβ. All of the data were acquired on a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). Genome-wide mapping of GABP binding locations in human Jurkat T cell lymphoma cells was performed using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) (23.Valouev A. Johnson D.S. Sundquist A. Medina C. Anton E. Batzoglou S. Myers R.M. Sidow A. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The sequence tag reads from anti-GABPα antibody and control IgG samples were downloaded and analyzed using the SISSRs application (24.Jothi R. Cuddapah S. Barski A. Cui K. Zhao K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). SISSRs v1.4 was run with option a (which retains one read/genomic position even if multiple reads were mapped to that position and thus avoids overrepresentation of one position caused by PCR amplification-generated bias) with fragment length F set to 200, p value set to 0.01, and the remaining parameters set to their default values. Each identified binding site is associated with a fold enrichment score, which is the ratio of the normalized number of GABP sequence tags supporting the inferred binding site to the normalized number of control IgG tags supporting the exact same site. Genome-wide distribution of GABPα-binding sites was determined with reference to RefSeq genes downloaded from the UCSC genome browser. DN thymocytes were isolated by depleting lineage-positive cells from total thymocytes using biotinylated antibodies and Dynabeads M280 Streptavidin (Invitrogen). Chromatin fragments of DN cells were prepared as previously described and immunoprecipitated with anti-GABPα antibody (H180; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) or rabbit IgG using Dynabeads Protein A (Invitrogen) (18.Xue H.H. Bollenbacher-Reilley J. Wu Z. Spolski R. Jing X. Zhang Y.C. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Immunity. 2007; 26: 421-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To assess enrichment of selected chromatin fragments by the GABPα antibody, primers were designed to amplify the conserved region of a gene in the mouse genome based on GABP binding locations in the same gene in the human genome as revealed by ChIP-Seq in Jurkat cells. Each primer set was tested for linear amplification range with input DNA using SYBR Advantage qPCR premix (Clontech) on ABI 7300 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). For Rag1 and Rag2 gene loci where no GABP binding was found in ChIP-Seq, the primers were designed to amplify their promoter regions as negative controls. For calculation of enrichment of each selected gene/region, 2−ΔCt was used, where ΔCt is the difference of Ct (cross-over threshold) values detected in GABPα antibody- and IgG-precipitated samples. Primer sequences for the amplification of each genomic segment are as follows: Rag1, 5′-AGCTATCACTGGGAGGCAGA and 5′-GAGGAGGCAAGTCCAGACAG; Rag2, 5′-CACTCTACCCTGCAGCCTTC and 5′-TCTGCCCTCTTGTAGCCAGT; Atm, 5′-ATGCCGACTTCTTCCTTTGG and 5′-TGAGGAAAGATGGGCTCAGA; Atr, 5′-TTTGTTGGGTCGTCAGGTC and 5′-GAAATCCCAGAGGCGACAG; Prkdc, 5′-CTCCGCATGGTTAGACTGGT and 5′-CTAGCCAGCTCTTCCCTGAA; Xrcc6, 5′-GCGTGGTCCGGTAATAAGGT and 5′-AGGGTGAGAGGCTGGAGAAG; Xrcc5, 5′- CTGATTGGGCGAGAGACAAG and 5′-TCAACCACCAGTCCTGTTCC; Dclre1c, 5′-GCCAGTGCTACCCACAAACT and 5′-ACTAGACCCAAAGCCCACCT; and Lig4, 5′-CAGCGTGCGGATACAACTAA and 5′-CTGCTAAGCAAGTGGTGTGG. Small interference RNA constructs targeting GABPα (siGABPα) and control vector pBS/U6 were described previously (19.Xue H.H. Bollenbacher J. Rovella V. Tripuraneni R. Du Y.B. Liu C.Y. Williams A. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Murine thymoma EL-4 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethnaol, and penicillin/streptomycin. EL-4 cells were transiently transfected by electroporation as described (19.Xue H.H. Bollenbacher J. Rovella V. Tripuraneni R. Du Y.B. Liu C.Y. Williams A. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In brief, 4 × 106 EL-4 cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 containing 25 mm HEPES, mixed with 9 μg of pBS/U6 or siGABPα along with 1 μg of pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) in a GenePulser cuvette (4-mm gap; Bio-Rad) and then electroporated at 250 V using a GenePulser Xcell electroporator (Bio-Rad). Forty-eight hours later, EYFPhigh cells were isolated by cell sorting, and total RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed using a QuantiTech reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). The resulting cDNA was then analyzed for expression of different genes using quantitative PCR as described above. Relative expression levels of genes of interest were normalized to that of a housekeeping gene, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1). Primer sequences for each transcript are as follows: Gabpa, 5′-CCGCTACACCGACTACGATT and 5′-ACCTTCATCACCAACCCAAG; Il7r, 5′-AAAGCATGATGTGGCCTACC and 5′-GACTCCACTCGCTCCAGAAG; Tyms, 5′- GCCCAGTTTATGGTTTCCAA and 5′-CCAGGCACACATGATGATTC; Pola1, 5′-TTGAACTGGAAGTGCTGCTG and 5′-CACATATCATTCGGCCACAG; Atm, 5′-AGTGTGGACATGGAGAGCACA and 5′-CGGAATATGGATCAGCCTCAAG; Atr, 5′-TGGTTGGAGAATGCTGGCTAC and 5′- ATAAGCGCCTGGTGAACGTC; Prkdc, 5′-AAGGCAGAAGCCTGGACAAG and 5′-ATCCGCCAGTAGGTCAATGC; Xrcc6, 5′-GATCAGAACATTCAGGTGACTCC and 5′-GCCTTCATCTTGTCTATCTGCTC;Xrcc5, 5′-GACCTGAAGAAGCTGGTGATGTG and 5′-TAGGATGACGTCCAGAGCTTCAC;Delre1c, 5′-CACCATCTCACAACGGACAG and 5′-TGGTAGATGGCTTGATGCTG; Lig4, 5′-TCGTGTCCTGATGCTTAGTTG and 5′-AGGAAGCCATAGAAGCGACAA; and Hprt1, 5′-GCGTCGTGATTAGCGATGATG and 5′-CTCGAGCAAGTCTTTCAGTCC. In our previous studies, we have generated GABPα-deficient mice using a gene trap strategy, yielding hypomorphic GABPα alleles (GABPαtp/tp) (19.Xue H.H. Bollenbacher J. Rovella V. Tripuraneni R. Du Y.B. Liu C.Y. Williams A. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In contrast to preimplantation lethality resulting from a complete GABPα-null mutation, hypomorphic expression of GABPα prolonged the survival of GABPαtp/tp embryos up to embryonic day 14.5 (19.Xue H.H. Bollenbacher J. Rovella V. Tripuraneni R. Du Y.B. Liu C.Y. Williams A. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). By transferring GABPαtp/tp fetal liver cells, which contain hematopoietic stem cells, into sublethally irradiated Rag2−/− mice, we observed partial blocks of T cell development at DN or DP stages. These data were presented as supplemental information in a previous report (18.Xue H.H. Bollenbacher-Reilley J. Wu Z. Spolski R. Jing X. Zhang Y.C. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Immunity. 2007; 26: 421-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The incomplete developmental block may be accounted for by the hypomorphic nature of the GABPα+/tp allele, where the levels of leaky expression of the WT GABPα protein may vary. To circumvent this caveat, we used conditionally targeted GABPα+/FL mice, in which exons 8 and 9 (encoding the DNA binding Ets domain) were flanked with LoxP sites (Fig. 1A) (21.Jaworski A. Smith C.L. Burden S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5040-5046Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The floxed GABPα allele was converted to a deleted allele (GABPα+/−) by crossing to EIIa-Cre transgenic mice. To inactivate GABPα in early developing thymocytes, we crossed GABPα+/FL and GABPα+/− to Lck-Cre transgenic mice to obtain LckCre-GABPαFL/+ and LckCre-GABPαFL/− progeny. LckCre-GABPαFL/+ mice showed expected normal DN, DP, and SP subsets. In contrast, LckCre-GABPαFL/− mice manifested a block at the DN stage in thymocyte development, with concomitant reduction of DP and SP cells (Fig. 1B). In some of the LckCre-GABPαFL/− mice, DP and SP thymocytes can be detected as more discrete populations. Regardless of the presence of DP and SP cells, all LckCre-GABPαFL/− mice had similar greatly diminished thymocyte cellularity (Fig. 1C). Despite the increased frequency of DN thymocytes, their absolute numbers were still significantly reduced (Fig. 1D), suggesting an absolute requirement of GABP for normal thymocyte maturation. We next examined early T cell development at the DN stages. LckCre-GABPαFL/− mice all exhibited increased frequency of DN3 subsets and a corresponding reduction in DN4 cells compared with LckCre-GABPαFL/+ controls (Fig. 2, A and B). The absolute counts of both DN3 and DN4 thymocytes were diminished in LckCre-GABPαFL/− mice, despite the increased DN3 frequency (Fig. 2C). The Lck-Cre transgene initiates excision of the floxed sequences at the DN2 stage and completes the excision at the DN3 stage (25.Lee P.P. Fitzpatrick D.R. Beard C. Jessup H.K. Lehar S. Makar K.W. Pérez-Melgosa M. Sweetser M.T. Schlissel M.S. Nguyen S. Cherry S.R. Tsai J.H. Tucker S.M. Weaver W.M. Kelso A. Jaenisch R. Wilson C.B. Immunity. 2001; 15: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). To determine the excision efficiency, we sorted DN3 and DN4 thymocytes from LckCre-GABPαFL/+ and LckCre-GABPαFL/− mice and used PCR to detect the conversion of a floxed allele to a deleted allele. In LckCre-GABPαFL/+ DN3 and DN4, the excision of the floxed allele was almost complete as expected, indicating the accessibility of the floxed GABPα allele and efficiency of LckCre-mediated excision (Fig. 2D). Contrary to the expectation that the floxed allele in LckCre-GABPαFL/− DN3 and DN4 cells should be converted to a deleted allele, it was still detectable, although the signal was weaker in DN4 cells. Our observations suggest that the excision of the floxed sequence is efficient in the presence of protection by a WT allele, converting GABPαFL/+ DN3 and DN4 thymocytes to GABPα−/+. On the other hands, in LckCre-GABPαFL/− DN3 and DN4 subsets, there is strong selection against “double deleted” GABPα−/− cells, leading to greatly diminished thymic cellularity. As a result, a considerable portion, if not all, of the remaining DN3 and DN4 thymocytes in LckCre-GABPαFL/− mice is an accumulation of those that escaped the complete excision and were detected as “undeleted” cells. This is not an unprecedented scenario. For example, when Mcl-1, a pro-survival Bcl-2 family member, was conditionally inactivated, profound reduction of thymocytes and peripheral T cells was observed, and the residual T cells found in the mice all contained a protective undeleted allele, indicating that the double deleted cells are not viable (26.Opferman J.T. Letai A. Beard C. Sorcinelli M.D. Ong C.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Strong selection against Mcl-1-null cells also occurred when it was inactivated in B lineage cells (26.Opferman J.T. Letai A. Beard C. Sorcinelli M.D. Ong C.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) or HSCs (27.Opferman J.T. Iwasaki H. Ong C.C. Suh H. Mizuno S. Akashi K. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2005; 307: 1101-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Similarly, lymphoblastomic leukemia 1 (Lyl1) and T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 (Tal1/Scl), members of the basic helix-loop-helix class transcription factors, are recently shown to be absolutely required for HSC survival, and Tal1−/−Lyl1FL/FL HSC-derived myeloid colonies always contained at least one Lyl1-floxed allele after type I interferon-induced, Mx1-Cre-mediated excision (28.Souroullas G.P. Salmon J.M. Sablitzky F. Curtis D.J. Goodell M.A. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 180-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that GABP critically regulates the expression of IL-7Rα in developing and mature T cells (19.Xue H.H. Bollenbacher J. Rovella V. Tripuraneni R. Du Y.B. Liu C.Y. Williams A. McCoy J.P. Leonard W.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although LckCre-GABPαFL/− DN3 thymocytes expressed similar levels of IL-7Rα compared with LckCre-GABPαFL/+ DN3 cells, the IL-7Rα expression was reduced in LckCre-GABPαFL/− DN4 cells (Fig. 2E). β-Selection occurs at the DN3 stage, which requires productive rearrangements of the TCRβ locus and successful pre-TCR signaling. The block at the DN3 stage in LckCre-GABPαFL/+ mice is reminiscent of failed TCRβ rearrangements, for example, because of deficiency in Rag recombinases. To determine whether GABPα has IL-7Rα-independent roles in early T cell development, we measured TCRβ expression by intracellular staining. As shown in Fig. 2E, although reduction of intracellular TCRβ was small in DN3 cells, LckCre-GABPαFL/− DN4 thymocytes exhibited more apparent decrease in intracellular TCRβ expression. These observations are consistent with the notion that DN3 and DN4 thymocytes in LckCre-GABPαFL/− mice may consist of a mixture of undeleted (FL/−) and double deleted (−/−) cells. The lack of apparent defects in IL-7Rα and TCRβ expression in DN3 might be explained by the fact that there are fewer double deleted cells because of stronger selection at this developmental stage. On the other hand, DN4 thymocytes might be less stringently dependent on GABPα activity for survival, and thus more double deleted DN4 thymocytes are present, allowing a window for observation of the effects derived from GABPα deficiency and thus revealing critical roles for GABP in supporting the normal expression of IL-7Rα and TCRβ in developing thymocytes. Diminished TCRβ expression in LckCre-GABPαFL/− DN4 thymocytes raised the intriguing possibility that GABP may contribute to the regulation of V(D)J recombination at the TCR loci in addition to its direct role in activating IL-7Rα transcription. High throughput analyses of GABP-associated genes have been performed on human Jurkat T cell lymphoma cells using ChIP coupled with DNA microarrays (ChIP-on-chip) (29.Hollenhorst P.C. Shah A.A. Hopkins C. Graves B.J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1882-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and more recently ChIP coupled with massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) (23.Valouev A. Johnson D.S. Sundquist A. Medina C. Anton E. Batzoglou S. Myers R.M. Sidow A. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The ChIP-Seq approach covers the entire genome and has enhanced sensitivity, and we therefore downloaded the ChIP-Seq data of GABPα antibody or control IgG-enriched sequence tags and reanalyzed the data using the SISSRs algorithm (24.Jothi R. Cuddapah S. Barski A. Cui K. Zhao K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Our analysis revealed ∼13,000 GABP binding locations where GABPα-associated sequences are significantly enriched. Focusing on protein-coding genes that harbor GABP-binding sites within 2 kb of their transcription initiation sites (TISs), we found that GABP is associated with 8308 unique RefSeq genes. It was reported that GABP has a unique role in inducing cell cycle re-entry through direct regulation of thymidylate synthase and p180 catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase α (encoded by TYMS and POLA1, respectively) (14.Yang Z.F. Mott S. Rosmarin A.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These genes were found to have enriched GABPα binding at their TISs, validating the usefulness of the ChIP-Seq data (GABP binding at the POLA1 locus was shown as an example in Fig. 3A). Based on the phenotypic analysis of LckCre-GABPαFL/− mice, we hypothesized that GABPα may have critical roles in TCRβ rearrangement, which is initiated by expression of RAG1 and RAG2 recombinases that introduce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The DSBs are dangerous lesions that can be sensed and amended in cells with great efficiency to avoid possible chromosomal abnormalities, cell death, or neoplastic transformation. Sensing the DSBs leads to activation of at least three phosphatidyl-inositol 3 kinase-like protein kinases, ATM, ATR, and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) (30.Callén E. Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7759-7764Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Repair of the DSBs is achieved by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) mechanism, which involves Ku70- and Ku80-containing DNA-PK complex, Artemis, Cernunnos, and DNA ligase IV (31.Soulas-Sprauel P. Rivera-Munoz P. Malivert L. Le Guyader G. Abramowski V. Revy P. de Villartay J.P. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7780-7791Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Analysis of these gene loci in the Jurkat ChIP-Seq data revealed that whereas no GABP binding was associated with the RAG1, RAG2, and NHEJ1 (encoding Cernunnos) loci, enriched GABP binding was found at the TISs of ATM, ATR, DCLRE1C (encoding Artemis), LIG4 (encoding DNA ligase IV), PRKDC, XRCC6, and XRCC5 (encoding the catalytic subunit, Ku70, and Ku80 components in the DNA-PK complex, respectively) genes (actual GABP binding at the LIG4 TIS shown in Fig. 3A, and fold enrichment of GABP binding summarized in Fig. 3B). To determine whether such GABP binding occurs in developing thymocytes, we isolated WT DN thymocytes and performed ChIP using an anti-GABPα antibody. The direct binding of GABP"

Wnt proteins and the inorganic pyrophosphate (PP(i)) transporter Ank regulate the differentiation process in many cell types. We investigated the possible contribution of Ank and/or PP(i) to the maintenance of the differentiated chondrocyte phenotype with special care to Wnt signaling. Primary articular chondrocytes lost their phenotype upon IL-1beta challenge, with cessation of type II collagen and Sox-9 expression. Ank expression and PP(i) transport were strongly reduced by IL-1beta, whereas Wnt-5a was the only Wnt protein increased. Transient overexpression of Ank counteracted most of IL-1beta effects on Type II collagen, Sox-9, and Wnt-5a expression. When resting chondrocytes were transfected with a siRNA against Ank, this reproduced the phenotype induced by IL-1beta. In both cases, no markers for hypertrophic chondrocytes were detected. The conditioned supernatant from chondrocytes knocked-down for Ank contained Wnt-5a, which activated Tcf/Lef reporter plasmids and promoted translocation of beta-catenin into the nucleus without activating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Supplementation with PP(i) compensated for most effects of Ank deficiency on Type II collagen, Sox-9, and Wnt-5 expression, both in IL-1beta and Ank knock-down conditions. Phenotype changes induced by IL-1beta were also supported by activation of the JNK pathway, but this latter was not sensitive to PP(i) supplementation. Altogether our data demonstrate that the transport of PP(i) by ANK contributed to the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of chondrocyte by controlling the canonical Wnt pathway in a Wnt-5a-dependent manner."

These include morphological alterations that emerge late in the process such as blebbing and increased permeability of the membrane. Earlier in the process, several more subtle membrane changes occur. The best studied is a loss of the normal asymmetrical transmembrane distribution of phospholipid species. Consequently, anionic lipids like phosphatidylserine, which are typically confined to the inner leaflet of the membrane, become exposed on the outer surface (1.Fadeel B. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).

A prominent example is the degree to which initial adsorption (step 1) depends on the presence of negative charge at the membrane surface (18.Singer A.G. Ghomashchi F. Le Calvez C. Bollinger J.

For hGV, the presence of a tryptophan residue at the interfacial binding surface of the enzyme diminishes this requirement and allows some adsorption to a zwitterionic interface (17.Han S.K. Kim K.P.

For snake venom sPLA2 from Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus, either or both steps may be limiting depending on the physical state of the membrane (15.Henshaw J.B. Olsen C.A. Farnbach A.R. Nielson K.H. Bell J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10709-10721Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This diversity of behaviors among sPLA2 isoforms suggests that they would respond differently to membrane changes induced by apoptosis. For example, migration of phosphatidylserine from the inner to outer surface of the cell membrane during apoptosis is an obvious means by which sPLA2 isoforms sensitive to negative charge might be capacitated to hydrolyze the membrane (25.Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Higashino K. Hanasaki K. Arita H. Horiguchi M. Arita M. Arai H. Inoue K. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31435-31444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Recent investigations have revealed additional changes such as increased interlipid spacing that may influence other isoforms (9.Bailey R.W. Nguyen T. Robertson L. Gibbons E. Nelson J.

This study is designed to explore sPLA2 species that differ in their membrane requirements and compare their response to bilayer physical properties associated with calcium ionophore and glucocorticoid-initiated apoptosis. Three human isoforms are included (hGIIa, hGV, and hGX). Snake venom (A. p. piscivorus) sPLA2 (AppD49) is used as a standard for internal comparison to previous studies. The monomeric aspartate 9 phospholipase A2 from the venom of A. p. piscivorus was isolated according to the procedure of Maraganore et al. (26.Maraganore J.M. Merutka G. Cho W. Welches W. Kézdy F.J.

Dexamethasone and ionomycin were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Acrylodan-labeled fatty acid-binding protein (ADIFAB), propidium iodide, cell culture medium, and serum were acquired from Invitrogen. S49 mouse lymphoma cells were grown as a suspension culture at 37 °C in humidified air containing 10% CO2 as explained (30.Wilson H.A. Huang W. Waldrip J.B. Judd A.M. Vernon L.P. Bell J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Samples treated with dexamethasone received the drug (100 nm final) 6–48 h before harvesting. Control samples received a corresponding volume of DMSO (0.02% v/v). For hydrolysis assays, cells were harvested by gentle centrifugation, washed, and suspended (0.4–3.5 × 106 cells/ml) in a balanced salt medium (MBSS: NaCl = 134 mm, KCl = 6.2 mm, CaCl2 = 1.6 mm, MgCl2 = 1.2 mm, Hepes = 18.0 mm, and glucose = 13.6 mm, pH 7.4, 37 °C). Samples were transferred to quartz fluorometer sample cells and equilibrated for at least 5 min in a spectrofluorometer (Fluoromax 3, Horiba Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ). Temperature and sample homogeneity were maintained using a water-jacketed sample chamber equipped with magnetic stirring and attached to a circulating water bath. All experiments were performed at 37 °C. The acrylodan-derivatized fatty acid-binding protein, ADIFAB, was used to assay the release of fatty acids from cell membranes in real time. Data were acquired from cell samples 100 s (excitation = 390 nm, emission = 432 and 505 nm, bandpass = 4 nm) before adding ADIFAB (65 nm final) to assay background intensity. After the addition of ADIFAB and stabilization of the fluorescence intensity (about 300–500 s), one of the four sPLA2 isoforms was added (0.07–70 nm final), and the time course was continued for an additional 800–2000 s. Fatty acid release was estimated by transforming the raw intensities to generalized polarization values (GP) and then fitting to an arbitrary function by nonlinear regression as described (31.Harris F.M. Smith S.K. Bell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22722-22731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). ADIFABGP=(l505−l432)(l505+l432)(Eq. 1) I505 and I432 are the fluorescence emission intensities at 505 and 432 nm. In experiments involving calcium ionophore, ionomycin (300 nm final) or the equivalent diluent (0.25% DMSO) was included in samples with ADIFAB for at least 300 s before adding sPLA2. The intensity of propidium iodide fluorescence was used to quantify the fraction of cells susceptible to hydrolysis by sPLA2 in samples treated with dexamethasone or equivalent DMSO. Cells were harvested, incubated, and mixed with sPLA2 isoforms as explained above for ADIFAB experiments with differences; propidium iodide (37 μm final) was included instead of ADIFAB, fluorescence intensity was assayed at 617 nm (excitation = 536 nm), and ionomycin was added at the end of the time course to render all the cells hydrolyzable and, thus, provide a maximum signal for internal comparison (9.Bailey R.W.

Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression and by quantifying the various subpopulations as described previously (9.Bailey R.W. Nguyen T. Robertson L. Gibbons E. Nelson J. Christensen R.E. Bell J.P. Judd A.M. Bell J.D. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 2709-2718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The subpopulation of interest for this study was that in which cells were still alive (i.e. excluded propidium iodide) but susceptible to sPLA2 (i.e. incorporated the dye upon the addition of sPLA2). This subpopulation was quantified by calculating the difference in propidium iodide fluorescence intensity before and after the addition of sPLA2 and normalizing to the maximum fluorescence change observed in samples treated with both AppD49 sPLA2 and ionomycin. Data were corrected for variations in cell number using direct cell counts (by light microscopy) and light scatter intensity. Because the emission spectra of ADIFAB and propidium iodide do not overlap, the fluorescence of the two probes was assayed simultaneously for some experiments (Fig. 1) as described previously (30.Wilson H.A. Huang W. Waldrip J.B. Judd A.M. Vernon L.P. Bell J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These experiments were done in parallel with spectrofluorometric measurements of hydrolysis and propidium iodide uptake. Cells were washed and suspended in MBSS. After washing, aliquots of the control and treatment samples were transferred to flow cytometry sample tubes and incubated for 5 min with propidium iodide (10 μm final). Cell subpopulations were then identified based on the level of fluorescence intensity using a BD FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with excitation at 488 nm, and emission was detected in the range of 564–606 nm. Fig. 1A displays a time course of hydrolysis of a sample of S49 cells by extracellular AppD49 sPLA2. As is typical for healthy untreated samples, a small amount of fatty acid (and lysophospholipid) was produced upon the addition of sPLA2 followed by a gradual return to base line as the reaction ended, and the products were salvaged by reacylation (13.Wilson H.A. Waldrip J.B. Nielson K.H. Judd A.M. Han S.K. Cho W. Sims P.J. Bell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11494-11504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This transient burst of hydrolysis was accompanied by a small increase in the permeability of the cells to the fluorescent dye propidium iodide (Fig. 1B). Normally, healthy cells exclude the dye, but when their membranes are damaged by hydrolysis, the dye enters the cells and binds to DNA and emits with higher intensity (10.Nielson K.H. Olsen C.A. Allred D.V. O'Neill K.L. Burton G.F. Bell J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This small rise in propidium iodide fluorescence, thus, represents cells that are initially alive (impermeable) but are then killed by the action of the phospholipase (labeled Alive & Susceptible in the Fig. 1 inset). Although the increased intensity in Fig. 1B was very small, it was consistent with previous studies comparing healthy and apoptotic cells (10.Nielson K.H. Olsen C.A. Allred D.V. O'Neill K.L. Burton G.F. Bell J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, when ionomycin was subsequently introduced into the sample, more extensive hydrolysis was observed, as indicated by a large elevation of free fatty acid (Fig. 1A) and propidium iodide emission (Fig. 1B). The enhanced enzymatic activity and resulting membrane damage upon the addition of ionomycin represented a hydrolytic attack of 100% of the cells as the level of propidium iodide fluorescence could not be further increased by subsequent incubation of the sample with a detergent (Triton X-100, 0.25% v/v). Interpretation of the experiments in this study requires that we determine whether the data in Fig. 1A represent uniform levels of hydrolysis among all the cells in the sample or extensive sensitivity of a small subpopulation of vulnerable cells. This question is of particular concern for experiments involving sPLA2 because the products of hydrolysis from one cell may be able to diffuse to another cell and induce hydrolysis as has been observed with artificial membranes (32.Bell J.D. Brown S.D. Baker B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1127: 208-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The matter was addressed by analysis of hydrolysis time courses in the context of flow cytometry data gathered on the same samples as explained below (Figs. 1, C and D). Previously, the transient burst of activity in control samples (Fig. 1A) was assumed to represent minor hydrolysis of all cells. To account for the complete cessation of hydrolysis even though substrate was restored by reacylation, a model was created in which cells become refractory after initial exposure to sPLA2 (13.Wilson H.A. Waldrip J.B. Nielson K.H. Judd A.M. Han S.K. Cho W. Sims P.J. Bell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11494-11504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, an alternative model in which a minority of the cells is susceptible to the enzyme and the remainder is resistant can also account quantitatively for the result if two assumptions are made. First, hydrolysis ceases because the membranes of vulnerable cells have been consumed. Second, uptake and reacylation of reaction products is accomplished by the remaining healthy cells in the sample. To distinguish these possibilities, we used flow cytometry to separate healthy cell samples into subpopulations based on propidium iodide permeability (Fig. 1C). Data were then compared with and without sPLA2 treatment to see whether all the cells were uniformly affected by the enzyme or whether certain subpopulations were preferentially altered. As shown in Fig. 1C, three subpopulations were identified as peaks in the flow cytometry histogram. Peak 1 represented cells that did not stain with propidium iodide. Peak 2 represented cells that displayed very low permeability to propidium iodide, an observation described for thymocytes early during apoptosis and necrosis (33.Lyons A.B. Samuel K. Sanderson A. Maddy A.H. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 809-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 34.Vitale M. Zamai L. Mazzotti G. Cataldi A. Falcieri E. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although the fluorescence intensity of these cells was 10 times that of background (Peak 1), it represented only 1% that observed for cells that were fully permeable to the dye (Peak 3). The complete permeability of the subpopulation shown in Peak 3 was confirmed by comparison to samples treated with the detergent Triton X-100 (0.1% v/v). Traditionally, cells arriving spontaneously in Peak 3 would be considered necrotic (34.Vitale M. Zamai L. Mazzotti G. Cataldi A. Falcieri E. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that necrotic cells are fully susceptible to hydrolysis by sPLA2 (8.Bailey R.W. Olson E.D. Vu M.P. Brueseke T.J. Robertson L. Christensen R.E. Parker K.H. Judd A.M. Bell J.D. Biophys.

Acta. 1997; 1349: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This interpretation was confirmed indirectly using samples that contained varied proportions of necrotic cells (6–81%). Aliquots of these samples were analyzed by flow cytometry in parallel with measurements of hydrolysis using ADIFAB. A very strong correlation was observed with respect to the amount of hydrolysis and the area of Peak 3 in the flow cytometry histogram (r2 = 0.93, p < 0.0001, n = 9). Moreover, the slope of the regression line was 0.91 ± 0.09, suggesting that the majority of the hydrolysis observed could be accounted for by the fully-permeable, necrotic cells of Peak 3. We were able to assess the hydrolytic susceptibility of the cells in Peak 2 more directly because these cells were only modestly permeable to propidium iodide, and hydrolysis would, therefore, have a distinct measurable effect by making the subpopulation more permeable. Accordingly, the area defined by this part of the histogram was compared before and after treatment with sPLA2. As shown by the dashed curve in Fig. 1C, Peak 2 was reduced dramatically after exposure to sPLA2 (p = 0.002, n = 19), presumably because the cells had become permeabilized by the enzyme and, thus, shifted into Peak 3. It is likely that the shallow slope of the time course in Fig. 1B represents the low permeability of the cells designated by Peak 2. If this is the case, the slope should be reduced after treatment with sPLA2 depletes the subpopulation. In fact, the slope of the time profile was reduced by 35% (p = 0.02, n = 6) upon the addition of sPLA2, again suggesting that the small burst of propidium iodide fluorescence seen in the inset of Fig. 1B represents hydrolytic attack of this tiny subpopulation. The large population of healthy impermeable cells in Peak 1 was also analyzed as described for Peak 2. In this case, the subpopulation was mostly unaffected by sPLA2; the area of Peak 1 was identical regardless of the presence of the phospholipase (Fig. 1C, p = 0.21, n = 19). Nevertheless, the mode of the peak was shifted slightly (7% increase in propidium iodide intensity compared with the 1000-fold increase when cells become fully permeable) but reproducibly (p = 0.006, n = 19). This result suggests that the enzyme probably does hydrolyze lipids of healthy cells but that the level is extremely small compared with the attack of the Peak 2 and Peak 3 subpopulations. To determine whether hydrolysis of these two apparently vulnerable subpopulations could account quantitatively for the transient fatty acid release observed from ADIFAB data, we added the area of Peaks 2 and 3 and compared that sum to the size of the hydrolysis data. As shown in Fig. 1D, the size of these two subpopulations and the amount of hydrolysis observed in aliquots from the same samples were indistinguishable (p = 0.74, n = 6). Even though these results are based on correlation, they demonstrated that a simple model can account quantitatively for the observation of transient hydrolysis rather than having to invoke the complex ideas proposed previously (13.Wilson H.A. Waldrip J.B. Nielson K.H. Judd A.M. Han S.K. Cho W. Sims P.J. Bell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11494-11504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, we concluded that the hydrolysis of healthy cell samples by sPLA2, as observed with ADIFAB fluorescence, reflects the action of the enzyme on small vulnerable subpopulations without adverse impact on the remaining cells. Treatment of S49 cells for 18 h with dexamethasone produced a level of hydrolysis by AppD49 sPLA2 intermediate between that observed in control versus ionomycin-treated samples (Fig. 2). As in Fig. 1A, subsequent addition of ionomycin induced hydrolysis of the remaining sample. Hence, as in the control samples, hydrolysis in apoptotic cells appeared confined to a sensitive subpopulation. Treatments, then, that enhan"

https://openalex.org/W2045894489,"The ability of thymocytes to assess T cell receptor (TCR) signaling strength and initiate the appropriate downstream response is crucial for determining their fate. We have previously shown that a c-Cbl RING finger mutant knock-in mouse, in which the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of c-Cbl is inactivated, is highly sensitive to TCR-induced death signals that cause thymic deletion. This high intensity signal involves the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant c-Cbl protein promoting a marked increase in the activation of Akt. Here we show that this high intensity signal in c-Cbl RING finger mutant thymocytes also promotes the enhanced induction of two mediators of TCR-directed thymocyte apoptosis, Nur77 and the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bim. In contrast, a knock-in mouse harboring a mutation at Tyr-737, the site in c-Cbl that activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, shows reduced TCR-mediated responses including suppression of Akt activation, a reduced induction of Nur77 and Bim, and greater resistance to thymocyte death. These findings identify tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Cbl as a critical sensor of TCR signal strength that regulates the engagement of death-promoting signals."
https://openalex.org/W2124073536,"For major histocompatibility complex class I and II molecules, the binding of specific peptide antigens is essential for assembly and trafficking and is at the center of their quality control mechanism. However, the role of lipid antigen binding in stabilization and quality control of CD1 heavy chain (HC).beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) complexes is unclear. Furthermore, the distinct trafficking and loading routes of CD1 proteins take them from mildly acidic pH in early endososmal compartments (pH 6.0) to markedly acidic pH in lysosomes (pH 5.0) and back to neutral pH of the cell surface (pH 7.4). Here, we present evidence that the stability of each CD1 HC.beta(2)m complex is determined by the distinct pH optima identical to that of the intracellular compartments in which each CD1 isoform resides. Although stable at acidic endosomal pH, complexes are only stable at cell surface pH 7.4 when bound to specific lipid antigens. The proposed model outlines a quality control program that allows lipid exchange at low endosomal pH without dissociation of the CD1 HC.beta(2)m complex and then stabilizes the antigen-loaded complex at neutral pH at the cell surface."

High performance liquid chromatography gel filtration analyses of this mini-spectrin provide the first direct non-imaging experimental evidence for open and closed spectrin dimers and show that dimer-tetramer-oligomer interconversion is slow at low temperatures and accelerated at 30 °C, analogous to full-length spectrin. This protein exhibits wild type dimer-tetramer dissociation constants of ∼1 μm at 30 °C, independent of initial oligomeric state.

https://openalex.org/W2029958370,"The mammalian embryonic zeta-globin genes, including that of humans, are expressed at the early embryonic stage and then switched off during erythroid development. This autonomous silencing of the zeta-globin gene transcription is probably regulated by the cooperative work of various protein-DNA and protein-protein complexes formed at the zeta-globin promoter and its upstream enhancer (HS-40). We present data here indicating that a protein-binding motif, ZF2, contributes to the repression of the HS-40-regulated human zeta-promoter activity in erythroid cell lines and in transgenic mice. Combined site-directed mutagenesis and EMSA suggest that repression of the human zeta-globin promoter is mediated through binding of the zinc finger factor RREB1 to ZF2. This model is further supported by the observation that human zeta-globin gene transcription is elevated in the human erythroid K562 cell line or the primary erythroid culture upon RNA interference (RNAi)(2) knockdown of RREB1 expression. These data together suggest that RREB1 is a putative repressor for the silencing of the mammalian zeta-globin genes during erythroid development. Because zeta-globin is a powerful inhibitor of HbS polymerization, our experiments have provided a foundation for therapeutic up-regulation of zeta-globin gene expression in patients with severe hemoglobinopathies."

DA signaling relies on a critical balance between release and removal of the neurotransmitter within synaptic clefts. Drugs of abuse, including psychostimulants and ethanol, cause maladaptive changes in DA signaling in mesolimbic areas of the brain, leading to addictive behaviors. Localized on pre-synaptic dopaminergic terminals, the dopamine transporter (DAT) is responsible for terminating DA signaling by rapidly removing the transmitter from the synaptic cleft region (1.Torres G.E. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). DAT and other monoamine transporters, including norepinephrine, γ-amino butyric acid, and serotonin (NET, GAT1, and SERT, respectively) clear extracellular transmitter via a reuptake mechanism (2.Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar).Regulation of DAT function is mediated by recycling of the transporters between intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane (3.Melikian H.E. Buckley K.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7699-7710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This dynamic trafficking occurs in both a constitutive and regulated manner to increase or decrease the number of transporters on the cell surface that are available for transmitter reuptake. Trafficking modulators, such as activated protein kinase C (PKC), have been shown to alter basal transporter trafficking rates. PKC-mediated regulation causes an intracellular accumulation of DAT by increasing internalization and decreasing insertion of the transporter on the cell surface (4.Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22168-22174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition to intrinsic transporter modulators, various drugs of abuse are known to target monoamine transporters. DAT is the main site of action of several psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines (5.Jayanthi L.D. Ramamoorthy S. AAPS J. 2005; 7: E728-E738Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6.Sulzer D. Maidment N.T. Rayport S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 7.Ritz M.C.

Cocaine inhibited DAT and increased the number of transporters on the cell surface by altering DAT trafficking in rat striatum and heterologously expressing cells (8.Chen N. Reith M.E. J.

Psychostimulant-induced modulation of transporter trafficking plays a critical role in mediating the mechanism of action of the drug.Ethanol is also known to activate DA pathways in the reward and reinforcing areas of the brain. Many groups have shown that ethanol alters DA signaling by increasing release of the transmitter (17.Brodie M.S. Appel S.B. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1998; 22: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18.Imperato A. Di Chiara G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 239: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Yoshimoto K. McBride W.J. Lumeng L. Li T.K. Alcohol. 1992; 9: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar); however, recent in vitro studies from our laboratory suggest ethanol modulates DAT function as well. Experiments in DAT-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes have shown ethanol potentiated [3H]DA uptake in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and enhanced transporter-mediated currents. The ethanol-induced increase in DA uptake in the oocytes was accompanied by an increase in binding of the cocaine analogue, [3H]WIN 35,428 ([3H]2-β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane), to DAT (20.Mayfield R.D. Maiya R. Keller D. Zahniser N.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similar effects of ethanol on DAT function and surface localization were found when the transporter was expressed in neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) or human embryonic kidney-293 cells (HEK-293) (21.Riherd D.N. Galindo D.G. Krause L.R. Mayfield R.D. Alcohol. 2008; 42: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Ethanol potentiation, however, is not observed among other monoamine transporters. For example, ethanol inhibited uptake of the closely related NET (22.Maiya R. Buck K.J. Harris R.A. Mayfield R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30724-30729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23.Lin A.M. Bickford P.C. Palmer M.R. Gerhardt G.A. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 164: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The opposing effect of ethanol on DAT and NET led to identification of ethanol-sensitive sites in the first intracellular loop of DAT using chimeras between DAT and NET (22.Maiya R. Buck K.J. Harris R.A. Mayfield R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30724-30729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Specifically, when glycine 130 and/or isoleucine 137 were replaced with the corresponding NET residues, threonine and phenylalanine, respectively, the ethanol sensitivity of the transporter was abolished in oocytes (22.Maiya R. Buck K.J. Harris R.A. Mayfield R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30724-30729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and significantly reduced in SK-N-SH and HEK-293 cells (21.Riherd D.N. Galindo D.G. Krause L.R. Mayfield R.D. Alcohol. 2008; 42: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The loss of ethanol sensitivity by these point mutations suggest ethanol alters DAT function or trafficking in a direct manner.The ethanol-induced potentiation of DA uptake and increase in DAT cell surface expression suggest ethanol modulates transporter function by redistributing DAT to the cell surface. However, it is not known how or if ethanol directly regulates DAT trafficking. In this study, we used [3H]DA uptake and biochemical methods to assess the pharmacological action of ethanol on DAT function and endosomal recycling. Basal and ethanol-regulated rates of insertion and internalization of the transporter were measured in HEK-293 cells using modified biotinylation assays. We found ethanol modulates DAT function by increasing the rate of insertion while having no effect on DAT endocytosis, resulting in an accumulation of the transporter on the plasma membrane. These results suggest an additional mechanism by which ethanol can potentially affect synaptic dopamine dynamics in mammalian systems.DISCUSSIONPrevious in vitro studies in DAT-expressing Xenopus oocytes and heterologous cell expression systems have shown ethanol potentiates [3H]DA uptake (20.Mayfield R.D. Maiya R. Keller D. Zahniser N.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21.Riherd D.N. Galindo D.G. Krause L.R. Mayfield R.D. Alcohol. 2008; 42: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of [3H]DA uptake revealed these changes were not due to alterations in the binding affinity of the transporter for dopamine (21.Riherd D.N. Galindo D.G. Krause L.R. Mayfield R.D. Alcohol. 2008; 42: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Ethanol-induced increases in transporter function were associated with an increase in [3H]WIN 35,428 DAT binding and expression on the cell surface, suggesting ethanol may alter transporter trafficking (20.Mayfield R.D. Maiya R. Keller D. Zahniser N.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21.Riherd D.N. Galindo D.G. Krause L.R. Mayfield R.D. Alcohol. 2008; 42: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the subcellular mechanisms underlying ethanol-mediated regulation of DAT surface expression are unknown. In this study, we found ethanol increases DAT-mediated [3H]DA uptake by altering endosomal recycling of the transporter. Our data suggest ethanol increases the rate of insertion of DAT into the cell membrane, while having no effect on the rate internalization. These ethanol-induced modulations of the DAT endosomal trafficking pathway result in a net increase of functional transporters on the cell surface.For these experiments, we used HEK-293 cells stably expressing DAT, which were developed in a previous study (21.Riherd D.N. Galindo D.G. Krause L.R. Mayfield R.D. Alcohol. 2008; 42: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The DAT HEK cells were utilized to directly examine the pharmacological action of ethanol on transporter function and trafficking. For comparison of function and surface localization, we developed another stable line of HEK-293 cells expressing an ethanol-insensitive mutant, G130T DAT. The G130T mutation was developed from chimeric studies between DAT and NET (22.Maiya R. Buck K.J. Harris R.A. Mayfield R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30724-30729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although closely related in structure and function, previous studies showed ethanol has opposing effects on DAT and NET (22.Maiya R. Buck K.J. Harris R.A. Mayfield R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30724-30729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23.Lin A.M. Bickford P.C. Palmer M.R. Gerhardt G.A. Neurosci.

Brain Res. 1997; 756: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). G130T DAT HEK cells were used in this study as a tool to determine if DAT sensitivity to ethanol was mediated by specific alterations in surface expression of the transporter. Finally, we used a biochemical approach to investigate ethanol-induced changes on endosomal recycling of DAT. Examining ethanol modulation of trafficking in vitro allows us to determine the direct pharmacological actions of ethanol on intracellular trafficking of the transporter. A caveat to this approach is that we can only determine the relative rates and changes in intracellular trafficking. The use of cell lines, which overexpress the transporter, does not allow for an accurate measurement of recycling rates found in intact neurons. However, this experimental approach allowed us to determine ethanol-induced changes on the distinct steps involved in endosomal recycling and yielded novel insights into the mechanisms of ethanol action on subcellular trafficking of the transporter.Characterization of DAT and G130T DAT function revealed the G130T mutation had no effect on basal [3H]DA uptake; however, the point mutation abolished the ethanol sensitivity of transporter function. In contrast, previous observations with HEK-293 and neuronal SK-N-SH cell lines transiently expressing transporters showed that G130T reduced, but did not eliminate, ethanol sensitivity in these mammalian cell expression systems (21.Riherd D.N. Galindo D.G. Krause L.R. Mayfield R.D. Alcohol. 2008; 42: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In these studies, stable expression of the transporters reduced variability in [3H]DA uptake assays compared with cells used in our previous study, which transiently expressed the transporters. This reduction of variability between assays in the current study likely contribute to these differences in [3H]DA. Ethanol potentiated DAT function in a clear concentration-dependent manner. The lower concentrations of ethanol (10 and 50 mm; 0.1% w/v or 100 mg/dl equals 21.7 mmol/liter) exhibited a time-dependent reduction in potentiation; i.e. ethanol-induced increases in DAT uptake function returned to basal levels. This reduction could be associated with an acute tolerance of the transporter to the lower concentrations of ethanol. Alternatively, if the initial ethanol concentration decreased over time, we could have reached the lower limit of measurable ethanol-induced effects at the longer time periods; however, steps were taken to minimize evaporation during the course of the assays.Analysis of ethanol-induced changes in DAT and G130T DAT surface expression indicated ethanol sensitivity of DAT was mediated by changes in surface expression and was specific for DAT. Ethanol induced a significant increase in cell surface DAT but had no effect on expression of G130T DAT in the membrane. Immunoblots revealed a population of the mutant transporter at ∼65–70 kDa. This population likely contains immature transporter retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Whereas the mutation does not interfere with known export, oligmerization or ER-retention motifs (34.Miranda M. Sorkina T. Grammatopoulos T.N. Zawada W.M. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30760-30770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), mutation of glycine 130 may alter folding of a portion of the transporter population, thus preventing export from the ER. However, a large portion of G130T transporter population is properly trafficked to the cell surface. Ethanol had no effect on these surface populations of mutant transporter, and misfolding does not likely contribute to the lack of an ethanol effect on G130T DAT surface expression. The mutation also does not interfere with known residues critical in DAT surface retention (25.Sorkina T. Richards T.L. Rao A. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 1361-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, ethanol-induced alteration of DAT surface expression does not appear to involve known signaling sequences required for constitutive trafficking of the transporter (35.Holton K.L. Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Ethanol also does not affect total cellular transporter levels or the size of DAT endosomal recycling pools. While not tested directly, these data suggest ethanol does not alter synthesis, ER transport or lysosomal degradation of transporter. Endogenous TfR surface expression was also not altered by ethanol, confirming ethanol does not have a nonspecific effect on endosomal trafficking. These results indicate the following: (i) ethanol-induced potentiation of DAT function is mediated by changes in surface expression of the transporter, (ii) this sensitivity is specific to DAT, and (iii) ethanol-induced increase in surface expression is likely due to alterations in the endosomal recycling pathway and not overall expression changes.Dynamic membrane trafficking of neurotransmitter transporters is essential for efficient regulation of the duration and strength of synaptic neurotransmission (5.Jayanthi L.D. Ramamoorthy S. AAPS J. 2005; 7: E728-E738Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The balance between insertion and endocytic internalization of transporters within the recycling pathway maintains homeostatic transmitter levels. DAT and other neurotransmitter transporters recycle in a constitutive manner. However, intrinsic and pharmacological modulators can also regulate endosomal recycling, mediating changes in neurotransmission (5.Jayanthi L.D. Ramamoorthy S. AAPS J. 2005; 7: E728-E738Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 35.Holton K.L. Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 36.Granas C.

Alterations in cell surface transporter expression arise from modulation of transporter insertion, internalization or both steps of the recycling pathway. For example, amphetamine-regulated DAT trafficking results in a suppression of transporter insertion and stimulation of endocytic rates, causing an overall decrease in surface levels of the transporter (14.Boudanova E. Navaroli D.M. Melikian H.E. Neuropharmacology. 2008; 54: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here we show that ethanol modulates distinct steps in the endosomal recycling of DAT. These novel findings suggest ethanol elevates surface expression of the transporter by increasing the rate of DAT insertion and without affecting the rate of internalization. The reduction of the overall number of transporters internalized by ethanol was likely a refection of depleted internal endosomal pools caused by the significant increase in insertion rate. Ethanol had no effect on TfR endosomal recycling, suggesting that TfR and DAT recycle in separate endosomal pools, and ethanol does not induce a generalized effect on trafficking of endosomes.The molecular components involved in ethanol-induced regulation of DAT recycling are unknown. DAT does not contain classical trafficking signal sequence sites such as tyrosine- or dileucine-based motifs (35.Holton K.L. Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Monoamine transporters are subject to regulation by PKC-dependent mechanisms; however, kinase-mediated phosphorylation is not required in regulated or constitutive trafficking of DAT (42.Chang M.Y. Lee S.H. Kim J.H. Lee K.H. Kim Y.S. Son H. Lee Y.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ethanol-sensitive areas of the transporter do not contain phosphorylation sites, suggesting ethanol-induced modulation of trafficking is not mediated through changes in the phosphorylation state of DAT. Accessory proteins are likely involved in ethanol modulation of exocytic insertion. For example, ethanol could disrupt direct protein-protein interactions, altering DAT insertion into the membrane. Ethanol-mediated changes in kinase activity could also alter transporter trafficking indirectly via other kinase-stimulated protein interactions, such as through the PKA pathway. Acute ethanol treatment has been recently shown to modulate PKA-dependent phosphorylation of trafficking-related proteins involved in vesicle recycling (43.Conti A.C. Maas Jr., J.W. Moulder K.L. Jiang X. Dave B.A. Mennerick S. Muglia L.J. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5697Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Alternatively, emerging evidence suggests rapid regulation and clustering of other neurotransmitter transporters is dependent on interaction with microfilament proteins (44.Duan S. Anderson C.M. Stein B.A. Swanson R.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10193-10200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Imoukhuede P.I. Moss F.J. Michael D.J. Chow R.H. Lester H.A. Biophys.

In fact, ethanol has been found to reorganize the actin and microtubulin cytoskeleton involved in glucose transporter trafficking, thus altering glucose uptake (48.Tomás M. Lázaro-Diéguez F. Durán J.M. Marín P. Renau-Piqueras J. Egea G. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 220-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Further investigation is needed to define the trafficking proteome, and ethanol action on those protein-protein interactions (49.Torres G.E. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In summary, the present study has revealed that ethanol modulates the DAT endosomal recycling pathway, thus directly altering transporter function. These novel findings are the first to describe ethanol effects on specific steps of the transporter trafficking pathway, and provides a framework to further understand the action of ethanol on DAT-mediated dopamine regulation. IntroductionDopamine (DA), 2The abbreviations used are: DAdopamineTCEPTris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochlorideDATdopamine transporterGFPgreen fluorescent proteinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumERendoplasmic reticulumANOVAanalysis of variance. a major central nervous system neurotransmitter, is involved in reward and reinforcing behaviors. DA signaling relies on a critical balance between release and removal of the neurotransmitter within synaptic clefts. Drugs of abuse, including psychostimulants and ethanol, cause maladaptive changes in DA signaling in mesolimbic areas of the brain, leading to addictive behaviors. Localized on pre-synaptic dopaminergic terminals, the dopamine transporter (DAT) is responsible for terminating DA signaling by rapidly removing the transmitter from the synaptic cleft region (1.Torres G.E. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). DAT and other monoamine transporters, including norepinephrine, γ-amino butyric acid, and serotonin (NET, GAT1, and SERT, respectively) clear extracellular transmitter via a reuptake mechanism (2.Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar).Regulation of DAT function is mediated by recycling of the transporters between intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane (3.Melikian H.E. Buckley K.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7699-7710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This dynamic trafficking occurs in both a constitutive and regulated manner to increase or decrease the number of transporters on the cell surface that are available for transmitter reuptake. Trafficking modulators, such as activated protein kinase C (PKC), have been shown to alter basal transporter trafficking rates. PKC-mediated regulation causes an intracellular accumulation of DAT by increasing internalization and decreasing insertion of the transporter on the cell surface (4.Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22168-22174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition to intrinsic transporter modulators, various drugs of abuse are known to target monoamine transporters. DAT is the main site of action of several psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines (5.Jayanthi L.D. Ramamoorthy S. AAPS J. 2005; 7: E728-E738Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6.Sulzer D. Maidment N.T. Rayport S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 7.Ritz M.C. Lamb R.J. Goldberg S.R. Kuhar M.J. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol Biol. Psychiatry. 1988; 12: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cocaine inhibited DAT and increased the number of transporters on the cell surface by altering DAT trafficking in rat striatum and heterologously expressing cells (8.Chen N. Reith M.E. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9.Little K.Y. Elmer L.W. Zhong H. Scheys J.O. Zhang L. Mol.

Amphetamine produced an initial increase in cell surface populations of the transporter in rat striatal synaptosomes (12.Johnson L.A. Furman C.A. Zhang M. Guptaroy B. Gnegy M.E. Neuropharmacology. 2005; 49: 750-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), followed by internalization of cell surface transporters and DAT-mediated DA efflux (13.Binda F. Dipace C. Bowton E.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6850-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Psychostimulant-induced modulation of transporter trafficking plays a critical role in mediating the mechanism of action of the drug.Ethanol is also known to activate DA pathways in the reward and reinforcing areas of the brain. Many groups have shown that ethanol alters DA signaling by increasing release of the transmitter (17.Brodie M.S. Appel S.B. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1998; 22: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18.Imperato A. Di Chiara G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 239: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Yoshimoto K. McBride W.J. Lumeng L. Li T.K. Alcohol. 1992; 9: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar); however, recent in vitro studies from our laboratory suggest ethanol modulates DAT function as well. Experiments in DAT-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes have shown ethanol potentiated [3H]DA uptake in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and enhanced transporter-mediated currents. The ethanol-induced increase in DA uptake in the oocytes was accompanied by an increase in binding of the cocaine analogue, [3H]WIN 35,428 ([3H]2-β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane), to DAT (20.Mayfield R.D. Maiya R. Keller D. Zahniser N.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similar effects of ethanol on DAT function and surface localization were found when the transporter was expressed in neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) or human embryonic kidney-293 cells (HEK-293) (21.Riherd D.N. Galindo D.G. Krause L.R. Mayfield R.D. Alcohol. 2008; 42: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Ethanol potentiation, however, is not observed among other monoamine transporters. For example, ethanol inhibited uptake of the closely related NET (22.Maiya R. Buck K.J. Harris R.A. Mayfield R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30724-30729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23.Lin A.M. Bickford P.C. Palmer M.R. Gerhardt G.A. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 164: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The opposing effect of ethanol on DAT and NET led to identification of ethanol-sensitive sites in the first intracellular loop of DAT using chimeras between DAT and NET (22.Maiya R. Buck K.J. Harris R.A. Mayfield R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30724-30729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Specifically, when glycine 130 and/or isoleucine 137 were replaced with the corresponding NET residues, threonine and phenylalanine, respectively, the ethanol sensitivity of the transporter was abolished in oocytes (22.Maiya R. Buck K.J. Harris R.A. Mayfield R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30724-30729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and significantly reduced in SK-N-SH and HEK-293 cells (21.Riherd D.N. Galindo D.G. Krause L.R. Mayfield R.D. Alcohol. 2008; 42: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The loss of ethanol sensitivity by these point mutations suggest ethanol alters DAT function or trafficking in a direct manner.The ethanol-induced potentiation of DA uptake and increase in DAT cell surface expression suggest ethanol modulates transporter function by redistributing DAT to the cell surface. However, it is not known how or if ethanol directly regulates DAT trafficking. In this study, we used [3H]DA uptake and biochemical methods to assess the pharmacological action of ethanol on DAT function and endosomal recycling. Basal and ethanol-regulated rates of insertion and internalization of the transporter were measured in HEK-293 cells using modified biotinylation assays. We found ethanol modulates DAT function by increasing the rate of insertion while having no effect on DAT endocytosis, resulting in an accumulation of the transporter on the plasma membrane. These results suggest an additional mechanism by which ethanol can potentially affect synaptic dopamine dynamics in mammalian systems."

We show here that during affinity purification of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo, phosphatidic acid, but not other anionic or zwitterionic phospholipids, is hydrolyzed to diacylglycerol. The phospholipase C activity elutes with the acetylcholine receptor and is inhibited by a lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase inhibitor, sodium vanadate, but not a phosphatidate phosphohydrolase inhibitor, N-ethylmaleimide. Further, the hydrolysis product of phosphatidic acid, diacylglycerol, enhances the functional capabilities of the acetylcholine receptor in the presence of anionic lipids. We conclude that a phospholipase C activity, which appears to be specific for phosphatidic acid, is associated with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The acetylcholine receptor may directly or indirectly influence lipid metabolism in a manner that enhances its own function."
