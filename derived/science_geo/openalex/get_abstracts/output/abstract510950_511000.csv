https://openalex.org/W2045361386,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is crucial to cancer progression and metastasis. Although multiple cellular miRNAs have been identified to regulate the EMT and metastasis in cancers, the role of viral miRNAs in cancer progression remains largely unknown. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated malignancy typically characterized by its early metastasis. In the present study, we have discovered the involvement of a viral miRNA, EBV-miR-BART7-3p, in the EMT and metastasis of NPC cells. Initially, we observed that EBV-miR-BART7-3p was highly expressed in NPC and positively correlated with lymph node metastasis and clinical stage of NPC. Subsequently, we demonstrated that EBV-miR-BART7-3p enhanced cell migration/invasion in vitro, cancer metastasis in vivo, and particularly the EMT characterized by loss of epithelial markers and gain of mesenchymal features in NPC cells. Furthermore, mechanistic studies disclosed that EBV-miR-BART7-3p targeted a major human tumor suppressor PTEN, modulating PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling and eventually leading to the high expression and nuclear accumulation of Snail and β-catenin, which favor EMT. Knockdown of PTEN could phenocopy the effect of EBV-miR-BART7-3p, whereas re-expression of PTEN resulted in a phenotypic reversion. Moreover, these findings were supported by an observation of an EBV-positive cell model in which silencing of endogenous EBV-miR-BART7-3p partially attenuated cell migration/invasion and altered EMT protein expression pattern via reverting PI3K/Akt, Snail and β-catenin expression. Thus, this study suggests a novel mechanism by which EBV-miR-BART7-3p modulates the EMT and metastasis of NPC cells, and a clinical implication of EBV-miR-BART7-3p as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target."

This study reports intimate partner violence (IPV) following disclosure of HIV test results by pregnant women. Methods In this cross sectional study we interviewed 1951 postnatal women who tested positive and negative for HIV about IPV experiences following HIV test disclosure, using an adapted WHO questionnaire. Multivariate regression models assessed factors associated with IPV after disclosure and controlled for factors such as previous IPV and other known behavioural factors associated with IPV. Results Over 93% (1817) disclosed the HIV results to their partners (96.5% HIV− vs. 89.3% HIV+, p<0.0001). Overall HIV prevalence was 15.3%, (95%CI:13.7–16.9), 35.2% among non-disclosers and 14.3% among disclosers. Overall 32.8% reported IPV (40.5% HIV+; 31.5% HIV− women, p = 0.004). HIV status was associated with IPV (partially adjusted 1.43: (95%CI:1.00–2.05 as well as reporting negative reactions by male partners immediately after disclosure (adjusted OR 5.83, 95%CI:4.31–7.80). Factors associated with IPV were gender inequity, past IPV, risky sexual behaviours and living with relatives. IPV after HIV disclosure in pregnancy is high but lower than and is strongly related with IPV before pregnancy (adjusted OR 6.18, 95%CI: 3.84–9.93). Conclusion The study demonstrates the interconnectedness of IPV, HIV status and its disclosure with IPV which was a common experience post disclosure of both an HIV positive and HIV negative result. Health services must give attention to the gendered nature and consequences of HIV disclosure such as enskilling women on how to determine and respond to the risks associated with disclosure. Efforts to involve men in antenatal care must also be strengthened."
https://openalex.org/W1982938145,"Bone marrow-derived cells have been used in different animal models of neurological diseases. We investigated the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) injected into the vitreous body in a model of optic nerve injury. Adult (3–5 months old) Lister Hooded rats underwent unilateral optic nerve crush followed by injection of MSC or the vehicle into the vitreous body. Before they were injected, MSC were labeled with a fluorescent dye or with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, which allowed us to track the cells in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging. Sixteen and 28 days after injury, the survival of retinal ganglion cells was evaluated by assessing the number of Tuj1- or Brn3a-positive cells in flat-mounted retinas, and optic nerve regeneration was investigated after anterograde labeling of the optic axons with cholera toxin B conjugated to Alexa 488. Transplanted MSC remained in the vitreous body and were found in the eye for several weeks. Cell therapy significantly increased the number of Tuj1- and Brn3a-positive cells in the retina and the number of axons distal to the crush site at 16 and 28 days after optic nerve crush, although the RGC number decreased over time. MSC therapy was associated with an increase in the FGF-2 expression in the retinal ganglion cells layer, suggesting a beneficial outcome mediated by trophic factors. Interleukin-1β expression was also increased by MSC transplantation. In summary, MSC protected RGC and stimulated axon regeneration after optic nerve crush. The long period when the transplanted cells remained in the eye may account for the effect observed. However, further studies are needed to overcome eventually undesirable consequences of MSC transplantation and to potentiate the beneficial ones in order to sustain the neuroprotective effect overtime."
https://openalex.org/W2066193202,"Background Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs), which are extremely stable and protected from RNAse-mediated degradation in body fluids, have emerged as candidate biomarkers for many diseases. The present study aimed to identify a serum microRNA (miRNA) expression profile that could serve as a novel diagnostic biomarker for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Methods Serum miRNA expression was investigated using four cohorts comprising 380 participants (healthy controls and patients with PBC) recruited between August 2010 and June 2013. miRNA expression was initially analyzed by Illumina sequencing using serum samples pooled from 3 patients and 3 controls. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was then used to evaluate the expression of selected miRNAs in a screening set (n = 40). A logistic regression model was then constructed using a training cohort (n = 192) and validated using another cohort (n = 142). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate diagnostic accuracy. Results We identified a miRNA panel (hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-141-3p, and hsa-miR-26b-5p) with a high diagnostic accuracy for PBC (AUC = 0.905, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.857 to 0.953; sensitivity = 80.5%, specificity = 88.3%). There was a significant difference between AUC values of the miRNA panel and those of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (AUC = 0.537, difference between areas = 0.314, 95% CI = 0.195 to 0.434, P<0.001), and those of antinuclear antibody (ANA) (AUC = 0.739, difference between areas = 0.112, 95% CI = 0.012 to 0.213, P = 0.0282). Conclusion We identified a serum microRNA panel with considerable clinical value in PBC diagnosis. The results indicate that the miRNA panel is a more sensitive and specific biomarker for PBC than ALP and ANA."

The nucleolus has emerged as a platform for the organization of chromatin enriched for repressive histone modifications associated with repetitive DNA. NPM1 is a nucleolar protein required for the maintenance of genome stability. However, the role of NPM1 in nucleolar chromatin dynamics and ribosome biogenesis remains unclear. We found that normal fibroblasts and cancer cells depleted of NPM1 displayed deformed nucleoli and a striking rearrangement of perinucleolar heterochromatin, as identified by immunofluorescence staining of trimethylated H3K9, trimethylated H3K27, and heterochromatin protein 1γ (HP1γ/CBX3). By co-immunoprecipitation we found NPM1 associated with HP1γ and core and linker histones. Moreover, NPM1 was required for efficient tethering of HP1γ-enriched chromatin to the nucleolus. We next tested whether the alterations in perinucleolar heterochromatin architecture correlated with a difference in the regulation of rDNA. U1242MG glioma cells depleted of NPM1 presented with altered silver staining of nucleolar organizer regions, coupled to a modest decrease in H3K9 di- and trimethylation at the rDNA promoter. rDNA transcription and cell proliferation were sustained in these cells, indicating that altered organization of heterochromatin was not secondary to inhibition of rDNA transcription. Furthermore, knockdown of DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A markedly enhanced rDNA transcription in NPM1-depleted U1242MG cells.

https://openalex.org/W2033889422,"Osteosarcomas remain an enigmatic group of malignancies that share in common the presence of transformed cells producing osteoid matrix, even if these cells comprise a minority of the tumor volume. The differentiation state of osteosarcomas has therefore become a topic of interest and challenge to those who study this disease. In order to test how the cell of origin contributes to the final state of differentiation in the transformed cells, we compared the relative tumorigenicity of Cre-LoxP conditional disruption of the cell cycle checkpoint tumor-suppressor genes Trp53 and Rb1 using Prx1-Cre, Collagen-1α1-Cre and Osteocalcin-Cre to transform undifferentiated mesenchyme, preosteoblasts and mature osteoblasts, respectively. The Prx1 and Col1α1 lineages developed tumors with nearly complete penetrance, as anticipated. Osteosarcomas also developed in 44% of Oc-Cre;Rb1(fl/fl);Trp53(fl/fl) mice. We confirmed using 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine click chemistry that the Oc-Cre lineage includes very few actively cycling cells. By assessing radiographic mineralization and histological osteoid production, the differentiation state of tumors did not correlate with the differentiation state of the lineage of origin. Some of the osteocalcin-lineage-derived osteosarcomas were among the least osteoblastic. Osteocalcin immunohistochemistry in tumors correlated well with the expression of DNA methyl transferases, suggesting that silencing of these epigenetic regulators may influence the final differentiation state of an osteosarcoma. Transformation of differentiated, minimally proliferative osteoblasts is possible but may require such an epigenetic reprogramming that the tumors no longer resemble their differentiated origins."
https://openalex.org/W2026710628,"Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), induced by brief periods of limb ischemia has been shown to decrease acute myocardial injury and chronic responses after acute coronary syndromes. While several signaling pathways have been implicated, our understanding of the cardioprotection and its underlying mediators and mechanisms remains incomplete. In this study we examine the effect of RIC on pro-autophagy signaling as a possible mechanism of benefit.We examined the role of autophagy in the acute/first window (15 minutes after RIC), delayed/second window (24 hours after RIC) and chronic (24 hours after 9 days of repeated RIC) phases of cardioprotection. C57BL/6 mice (N = 69) were allocated to each treatment phase and further stratified to receive RIC, induced by four cycles of 5 minutes of limb ischemia followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion, or control treatment consisting solely of handling without transient ischemia. The groups included, group 1 (1W control), group 2 (1W RIC), group 3 (2W control), group 4 (2W RIC), group 5 (3W control) and group 6 (3W RIC). Hearts were isolated for assessment of cardiac function and infarct size after global ischemia using a Langendorff preparation. Infarct size was reduced in all three phases of cardioprotection, in association with improvements in post-ischemic left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and developed pressure (LVDP) (P<0.05). The pattern of autophagy signaling varied; 1W RIC increased AMPK levels and decreased the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), whereas chronic RIC was associated with persistent mTOR suppression and increased levels of autophagosome proteins, LC3II/I and Atg5.Cardioprotection following transient ischemia exists in both the acute and delayed/chronic phases of conditioning. RIC induces pro-autophagy signaling but the pattern of responses varies depending on the phase, with the most complete portfolio of responses observed when RIC is administered chronically."
https://openalex.org/W1970708941,"Unfolded protein response (UPR) is an adaptive reaction that allows cancer cells to survive endoplasmic reticulum (EnR) stress that is often induced in the tumor microenvironment because of inadequate vascularization. Previous studies report an association between activation of the UPR and reduced sensitivity to antiestrogens and chemotherapeutics in estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive and triple-negative breast cancers, respectively. ERα has been shown to regulate the expression of a key mediator of the EnR stress response, the X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1). Although network prediction models have associated ERβ with the EnR stress response, its role as regulator of the UPR has not been experimentally tested. Here, upregulation of wild-type ERβ (ERβ1) or treatment with ERβ agonists enhanced apoptosis in breast cancer cells in the presence of pharmacological inducers of EnR stress. Targeting the BCL-2 to the EnR of the ERβ1-expressing cells prevented the apoptosis induced by EnR stress but not by non-EnR stress apoptotic stimuli indicating that ERβ1 promotes EnR stress-regulated apoptosis. Downregulation of inositol-requiring kinase 1α (IRE1α) and decreased splicing of XBP-1 were associated with the decreased survival of the EnR-stressed ERβ1-expressing cells. ERβ1 was found to repress the IRE1 pathway of the UPR by inducing degradation of IRE1α. These results suggest that the ability of ERβ1 to target the UPR may offer alternative treatment strategies for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2011374247,"S-Acylation of hemagglutinin (HA), the main glycoprotein of influenza viruses, is an essential modification required for virus replication. Using mass spectrometry, we have previously demonstrated specific attachment of acyl chains to individual acylation sites. Whereas the two cysteines in the cytoplasmic tail of HA contain only palmitate, stearate is exclusively attached to a cysteine positioned at the end of the transmembrane region (TMR). Here we analyzed recombinant viruses containing HA with exchange of conserved amino acids adjacent to acylation sites or with a TMR cysteine shifted to a cytoplasmic location to identify the molecular signal that determines preferential attachment of stearate. We first developed a new protocol for sample preparation that requires less material and might thus also be suitable to analyze cellular proteins. We observed cell type-specific differences in the fatty acid pattern of HA: more stearate was attached if human viruses were grown in mammalian compared with avian cells. No underacylated peptides were detected in the mass spectra, and even mutations that prevented generation of infectious virus particles did not abolish acylation of expressed HA as demonstrated by metabolic labeling experiments with [3H]palmitate. Exchange of conserved amino acids in the vicinity of an acylation site had a moderate effect on the stearate content. In contrast, shifting the TMR cysteine to a cytoplasmic location virtually eliminated attachment of stearate. Thus, the location of an acylation site relative to the transmembrane span is the main signal for stearate attachment, but the sequence context and the cell type modulate the fatty acid pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2044271499,"Co-infections with parasites or viruses drive tuberculosis dynamics in humans, but little is known about their effects in other non-human hosts. This work aims to investigate the relationship between Mycobacterium bovis infection and other pathogens in wild boar (Sus scrofa), a recognized reservoir of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Mediterranean ecosystems. For this purpose, it has been assessed whether contacts with common concomitant pathogens are associated with the development of severe bTB lesions in 165 wild boar from mid-western Spain. The presence of bTB lesions affecting only one anatomic location (cervical lymph nodes), or more severe patterns affecting more than one location (mainly cervical lymph nodes and lungs), was assessed in infected animals. In addition, the existence of contacts with other pathogens such as porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV), swine influenza virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Haemophilus parasuis and Metastrongylus spp, was evaluated by means of serological, microbiological and parasitological techniques. The existence of contacts with a structured community of pathogens in wild boar infected by M. bovis was statistically investigated by null models. Association between this community of pathogens and bTB severity was examined using a Partial Least Squares regression approach. Results showed that adult wild boar infected by M. bovis had contacted with some specific, non-random pathogen combinations. Contact with PCV2, ADV and infection by Metastrongylus spp, was positively correlated to tuberculosis severity. Therefore, measures against these concomitant pathogens such as vaccination or deworming, might be useful in tuberculosis control programmes in the wild boar. However, given the unexpected consequences of altering any community of organisms, further research should evaluate the impact of such measures under controlled conditions. Furthermore, more research including other important pathogens, such as gastro-intestinal nematodes, will be necessary to complete this picture."
https://openalex.org/W2076874034,"Mitochondrial proteins have been shown to be common targets of S-nitrosylation (SNO), but the existence of a mitochondrial source of nitric oxide remains controversial. SNO is a nitric oxide-dependent thiol modification that can regulate protein function. Interestingly, trans-S-nitrosylation represents a potential pathway for the import of SNO into the mitochondria. The glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which has been shown to act as a nuclear trans-S-nitrosylase, has also been shown to enter mitochondria. However, the function of GAPDH in the mitochondria remains unknown. Therefore, we propose the hypothesis that S-nitrosylated GAPDH (SNO-GAPDH) interacts with mitochondrial proteins as a trans-S-nitrosylase. In accordance with this hypothesis, SNO-GAPDH should be detected in mitochondrial fractions, interact with mitochondrial proteins, and increase mitochondrial SNO levels. Our results demonstrate a four-fold increase in GAPDH levels in the mitochondrial fraction of mouse hearts subjected to ischemic preconditioning, which increases SNO-GAPDH levels. Co-immunoprecipitation studies performed in mouse hearts perfused with the S-nitrosylating agent S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), suggest that SNO promotes the interaction of GAPDH with mitochondrial protein targets. The addition of purified SNO-GAPDH to isolated mouse heart mitochondria demonstrated the ability of SNO-GAPDH to enter the mitochondrial matrix, and to increase SNO for many mitochondrial proteins. Further, the overexpression of GAPDH in HepG2 cells increased SNO for a number of different mitochondrial proteins, including heat shock protein 60, voltage-dependent anion channel 1, and acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, thus supporting the role of GAPDH as a potential mitochondrial trans-S-nitrosylase. In further support of this hypothesis, many of the mitochondrial SNO proteins identified with GAPDH overexpression were no longer detected with GAPDH knock-down or mutation. Therefore, our results suggest that SNO-GAPDH can act as a mitochondrial trans-S-nitrosylase, thereby conferring the transfer of SNO from the cytosol to the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2026020529,"Background and Aims The virus/host interplay mediates liver pathology in chronic HBV infection. MiRNAs play a pivotal role in virus/host interactions and are detected in both serum and HBsAg-particles, but studies of their dynamics during chronic infection and antiviral therapy are missing. We studied serum miRNAs during different phases of chronic HBV infection and antiviral treatment. Methods MiRNAs were profiled by miRCURY-LNA-Universal-RT-miRNA-PCR (Exiqon-A/S) and qPCR-panels-I/II-739-miRNA-assays and single-RT-q-PCRs. Two cohorts of well-characterized HBsAg-carriers were studied (median follow-up 34–52 months): a) training-panel (141 sera) and HBsAg-particles (32 samples) from 61 HBsAg-carriers and b) validation-panel (136 sera) from 84 carriers. Results Thirty-one miRNAs were differentially expressed in inactive-carriers (IC) and chronic-hepatitis-B (CHB) with the largest difference for miR-122-5p, miR-99a-5p and miR-192-5p (liver-specific-miRNAs), over-expressed in both sera and HBsAg-particles of CHB (ANOVA/U-test p-values: <0.000001/0.000001; <0.000001/0.000003; <0.000001/0.000005, respectively) and significantly down-regulated during- and after-treatment in sustained-virological-responders (SVR). MiRNA-profiles of IC and SVR clustered in the heatmap. Liver-miRNAs were combined with miR-335, miR-126 and miR-320a (internal controls) to build a MiR-B-Index with 100% sensitivity, 83.3% and 92.5% specificity (−1.7 cut-off) in both training and validation cohorts to identify IC. MiR-B-Index (−5.72, −20.43/14.38) correlated with ALT (49, 10/2056 U/l, ρ = −0.497, p<0.001), HBV-DNA (4.58, undetectable/>8.3 Log10 IU/mL, ρ = −0.732, p<0.001) and HBsAg (3.40, 0.11/5.49 Log10 IU/mL, ρ = −0.883, p<0.001). At multivariate analysis HBV-DNA (p = 0.002), HBsAg (p<0.001) and infection-phase (p<0.001), but not ALT (p = 0.360) correlated with MiR-B-Index. In SVR to Peg-IFN/NUCs MiR-B-Index improved during-therapy and post-treatment reaching IC-like values (5.32, −1.65/10.91 vs 6.68, 0.54/9.53, p = 0.324) beckoning sustained HBV-immune-control earlier than HBsAg-decline. Conclusions Serum miRNA profile change dynamically during the different phases of chronic HBV infection. We identified a miRNA signature associated with both natural-occurring and therapy-induced immune control of HBV infection. The MiR-B-Index might be a useful biomarker for the early identification of the sustained switch from CHB to inactive HBV-infection in patients treated with antivirals."
https://openalex.org/W2121581371,"MutS Homolog 1 (MSH1) encodes a plant-specific protein that functions in mitochondria and chloroplasts. We showed previously that disruption or suppression of the MSH1 gene results in a process of developmental reprogramming that is heritable and non-genetic in subsequent generations. In Arabidopsis, this developmental reprogramming process is accompanied by striking changes in gene expression of organellar and stress response genes. This developmentally reprogrammed state, when used in crossing, results in a range of variation for plant growth potential. Here we investigate the implications of MSH1 modulation in a crop species. We found that MSH1-mediated phenotypic variation in Sorghum bicolor is heritable and potentially valuable for crop breeding. We observed phenotypic variation for grain yield, plant height, flowering time, panicle architecture, and above-ground biomass. Focusing on grain yield and plant height, we found some lines that appeared to respond to selection. Based on amenability of this system to implementation in a range of crops, and the scope of phenotypic variation that is derived, our results suggest that MSH1 suppression provides a novel approach for breeding in crops."
https://openalex.org/W2055300754,"Studies of the effects of patch size and isolation on plant species density have yielded contrasting results. However, much of the available evidence comes from relatively recent anthropogenic forest fragments which have not reached equilibrium between extinction and immigration. This is a critical issue because the theory clearly states that only when equilibrium has been reached can the number of species be accurately predicted by habitat size and isolation. Therefore, species density could be better predicted by patch size and isolation in an ecosystem that has been fragmented for a very long time. We tested whether patch area, isolation and other spatial variables explain variation among forest patches in plant species density in an ecosystem where the forest has been naturally fragmented for long periods of time on a geological scale. Our main predictions were that plant species density will be positively correlated with patch size, and negatively correlated with isolation (distance to the nearest patch, connectivity, and distance to the continuous forest). We surveyed the vascular flora (except lianas and epiphytes) of 19 forest patches using five belt transects (50×4 m each) per patch (area sampled per patch = 0.1 ha). As predicted, plant species density was positively associated (logarithmically) with patch size and negatively associated (linearly) with patch isolation (distance to the nearest patch). Other spatial variables such as patch elevation and perimeter, did not explain among-patch variability in plant species density. The power of patch area and isolation as predictors of plant species density was moderate (together they explain 43% of the variation), however, a larger sample size may improve the explanatory power of these variables. Patch size and isolation may be suitable predictors of long-term plant species density in terrestrial ecosystems that are naturally and anthropogenically fragmented."
https://openalex.org/W2035950500,"Chromosomal INstability (CIN), a hallmark of cancer, refers to cells with an increased rate of gain or loss of whole chromosomes or chromosome parts. CIN is linked to the progression of tumors with poor clinical outcomes such as drug resistance. CIN can give tumors the diversity to resist therapy, but it comes at the cost of significant stress to tumor cells. To tolerate this, cancer cells must modify their energy use to provide adaptation against genetic changes as well as to promote their survival and growth. In this study, we have demonstrated that CIN induction causes sensitivity to metabolic stress. We show that mild metabolic disruption that does not affect normal cells, can lead to high levels of oxidative stress and subsequent cell death in CIN cells because they are already managing elevated stress levels. Altered metabolism is a differential characteristic of cancer cells, so our identification of key regulators that can exploit these changes to cause cell death may provide cancer-specific potential drug targets, especially for advanced cancers that exhibit CIN."
https://openalex.org/W2057139810,"Injury is a significant cause of childhood death and can result in substantial long-term disability. Injuries are more common in children from socio-economically deprived families, contributing to health inequalities between the most and least affluent. However, little is known about how the relationship between injuries and deprivation has changed over time in the UK.We conducted a cohort study of all children under 5 registered in one of 495 UK general practices that contributed medical data to The Health Improvement Network database between 1990-2009. We estimated the incidence of fractures, burns and poisonings by age, sex, socio-economic group and calendar period and adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) comparing the least and most socio-economically deprived areas over time. Estimates of the UK annual burden of injuries and the excess burden attributable to deprivation were derived from incidence rates.The cohort of 979,383 children experienced 20,804 fractures, 15,880 burns and 10,155 poisonings, equating to an incidence of 75.8/10,000 person-years (95% confidence interval 74.8-76.9) for fractures, 57.9 (57.0-58.9) for burns and 37.3 (35.6-38.0) for poisonings. Incidence rates decreased over time for burns and poisonings and increased for fractures (p<0.001 test for trend for each injury). They were significantly higher in more deprived households (IRR test for trend p<0.001 for each injury type) and these gradients persisted over time. We estimate that 865 fractures, 3,763 burns and 3,043 poisonings could be prevented each year in the UK if incidence rates could be reduced to those of the most affluent areas.The incidence of burns and poisonings declined between 1990 and 2009 but increased for fractures. Despite these changes, strong socio-economic inequalities persisted resulting in an estimated 9,000 additional medically-attended injuries per year in under-5s."
https://openalex.org/W2083256382,"This Phase 1, randomized, two-site (United States), double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 18 sexually abstinent men and women. All received a single 300-mg dose of oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and were then randomized 2∶1 to receive single and then seven daily rectal exposures of vaginally-formulated tenofovir (TFV) 1% gel or a hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) placebo gel. Blood, colonic biopsies and rectal and vaginal mucosal fluids were collected after the single oral TDF, the single topical TFV gel dose, and after 7 days of topical TFV gel dosing for extracellular analysis of TFV and intracellular analysis of the active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate (TFVdp) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and isolated mucosal mononuclear cells (MMC), including CD4+ and CD4- cell subsets. With a single rectal dose, TFV plasma concentrations were 24–33 fold lower and half-life was 5 h shorter compared to a single oral dose (p = 0.02). TFVdp concentrations were also undetectable in PBMCs with rectal dosing. Rectal tissue exposure to both TFV and TFVdp was 2 to 4-log10 higher after a single rectal dose compared to a single oral dose, and after 7 daily doses, TFVdp accumulated 4.5 fold in tissue. TFVdp in rectal tissue homogenate was predictive (residual standard error, RSE = 0.47) of tissue MMC intracellular TFVdp concentration, with the CD4+ cells having a 2-fold higher TFVdp concentration than CD4- cells. TFV concentrations from rectal sponges was a modest surrogate indicator for both rectal tissue TFV and TFVdp (RSE = 0.67, 0.66, respectively) and plasma TFV (RSE = 0.38). TFV penetrates into the vaginal cavity after oral and rectal dosing, with rectal dosing leading to higher vaginal TFV concentrations (p<0.01). Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00984971"
https://openalex.org/W2028875396,"Objective It has been shown that Mindbomb (Mib), an E3 Ubiquitin ligase, is an essential modulator of Notch signaling during development. However, its effects on vascular development remain largely unknown. Approaches and Results We identified a number of novel proteins that physically interact with Mib, including the Factor Inhibiting Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (FIH-1, also known as HIF1AN) from a yeast two hybrid screen, as previously reported. In cultured cells, FIH-1 colocalizes with Mib1, corroborating their potential interaction. In zebrafish embryos, FIH-1 appears to modulate VEGF-A signaling activity; depletion of fih-1 induces ectopic expression of vascular endothelial growth factor–a (vegfa) and leads to exuberant ectopic sprouts from intersegmental vessels (ISVs). Conversely, over-expression of fih-1 substantially attenuates the formation of ISVs, which can be rescued by concurrent over-expression of vegfa, indicating that FIH-1/HIF1AN may fine tune VEGF-A signaling. Conclusions Taken together, our data suggest that FIH-1 interacts with Mib E3 Ubiquitin ligase and modulates vascular development by attenuating VEGF-A signaling activity."
https://openalex.org/W2156309292,"Although many studies have investigated the facial characteristics that influence perceptions of others’ attractiveness and dominance, the majority of these studies have focused on either the effects of shape information or surface information alone. Consequently, the relative contributions of facial shape and surface characteristics to attractiveness and dominance perceptions are unclear. To address this issue, we investigated the relationships between ratings of original versions of faces and ratings of versions in which either surface information had been standardized (i.e., shape-only versions) or shape information had been standardized (i.e., surface-only versions). For attractiveness and dominance judgments of both male and female faces, ratings of shape-only and surface-only versions independently predicted ratings of the original versions of faces. The correlations between ratings of original and shape-only versions and between ratings of original and surface-only versions differed only in two instances. For male attractiveness, ratings of original versions were more strongly related to ratings of surface-only than shape-only versions, suggesting that surface information is particularly important for men’s facial attractiveness. The opposite was true for female physical dominance, suggesting that shape information is particularly important for women’s facial physical dominance. In summary, our results indicate that both facial shape and surface information contribute to judgments of others’ attractiveness and dominance, suggesting that it may be important to consider both sources of information in research on these topics."
https://openalex.org/W2003210244,"Third party punishment can be evolutionarily stable if there is heterogeneity in the cost of punishment or if punishers receive a reputational benefit from their actions. A dominant position might allow some individuals to punish at a lower cost than others and by doing so access these reputational benefits. Three vignette-based studies measured participants' judgements of a third party punisher in comparison to those exhibiting other aggressive/dominant behaviours (Study 1), when there was variation in the success of punishment (Study 2), and variation in the status of the punisher and the type of punishment used (Study 3). Third party punishers were judged to be more likeable than (but equally dominant as) those who engaged in other types of dominant behaviour (Study 1), were judged to be equally likeable and dominant whether their intervention succeeded or failed (Study 2), and participants believed that only a dominant punisher could intervene successfully (regardless of whether punishment was violent or non-violent) and that subordinate punishers would face a higher risk of retaliation (Study 3). The results suggest that dominance can dramatically reduce the cost of punishment, and that while individuals can gain a great deal of reputational benefit from engaging in third party punishment, these benefits are only open to dominant individuals. Taking the status of punishers into account may therefore help explain the evolution of third party punishment."
https://openalex.org/W2006113998,"Inflammation enables human cancers and is a critical promoter of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TIMP3 (Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3), a natural metalloproteinase inhibitor, controls cytokine and growth factor bioavailability to keep inflammation in check and regulate cell survival in the liver. TIMP3 is also found silenced in human cancers. We therefore tested whether Timp3 affects HCC predisposition. Remarkably, genetic loss of Timp3 protected from carcinogen-induced HCC through the immediate engagement of several tumor suppressor pathways, while tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling was dispensable for this protection. All wild-type mice developed HCC by 12 months, whereas HCC incidence was reduced to 33% at 12 months and 57% at 15 months in Timp3 null mice. Upon acute carcinogen treatment the deficient livers exhibited greater cytokine expression, but lower cell death and higher hepatocyte senescence. We found that precocious activation of p53, p38 and Notch preceded senescence and hepatic cell differentiation, and these events were conserved throughout tumorigenesis. Timp3-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts also responded to carcinogen by favoring senescence over apoptosis. We conclude that Timp3 status determines p53, p38 and Notch coactivation to instruct hepatic cell fate and transformation and uncover mechanisms that are protective even within a pro-inflammatory microenvironment."

The essential contribution of SCCRO to neddylation is to promote nuclear translocation of the cullin-ROC1 complex. The presence of a myristoyl sequence in SCCRO3, one of four SCCRO paralogues present in humans that localizes to the membrane, raises questions about its function in neddylation. We found that although SCCRO3 binds to CAND1, cullins, and ROC1, it does not efficiently bind to Ubc12, promote cullin neddylation, or conform to the reaction processivity paradigms, suggesting that SCCRO3 does not have E3 activity. Expression of SCCRO3 inhibits SCCRO-promoted neddylation by sequestering cullins to the membrane, thereby blocking its nuclear translocation. Moreover, SCCRO3 inhibits SCCRO transforming activity. The inhibitory effects of SCCRO3 on SCCRO-promoted neddylation and transformation require both an intact myristoyl sequence and PONY domain, confirming that membrane localization and binding to cullins are required for in vivo functions.

https://openalex.org/W2066998622,"The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fer belongs to a distinct subfamily of F-BAR domain containing kinases implicated in vesicular trafficking and signaling downstream of adhesion and growth factor receptors. Targeted inactivation of the fer gene in a transgenic mouse model of HER2+, breast cancer was associated with delayed tumor onset and reduced proliferative rates in tumor cells. Fer deficiency was associated with increased rates of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) internalization and amplified Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk (Ras-MAPK) signaling in primary mammary tumor epithelial cells, as well as increased cytotoxic and anti-proliferative sensitivity to the dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor Lapatinib (LPN). These observations suggest a model in which accelerated ligand-induced EGFR internalization in Fer-deficient cells hypersensitizes the Ras-MAPK pathway to EGF, resulting in MAPK signal amplification to levels that induce cytostasis, rather than proliferation. Thus, Ras-MAPK cytostatic signaling delays HER2 tumor initiation and increases LPN cytotoxicity in Fer-deficient model systems. Taken together, these data suggest that targeting Fer alone, or in combination with LPN, may be of therapeutic benefit in HER2+ breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2074611043,"Disruption of Apc (adenomatous polyposis coli) within hepatocytes activates Wnt signalling, perturbs differentiation and ultimately leads to neoplasia. Apc negatively regulates Wnt signalling but is also involved in organizing the cytoskeleton and may have a role in chromosome segregation. In vitro studies have implicated Apc in the control of genomic stability. However, the relevance of this data has been questioned in vivo as Apc is lost earlier than the onset of genomic instability. Here we analyse the relationship between immediate loss of Apc and the acquisition of genomic instability in hepatocytes. We used Cre-lox technology to inactivate Apc and in combination with p53 in vivo, to define the consequences of gene loss on cell cycle regulation, proliferation, death and aneuploidy. We show that, although Apc loss leads to increased proliferation, it also leads to increased apoptosis, the accumulation of p53, p21 and markers of double-strand breaks and DNA repair. Flow cytometry revealed an increased 4N DNA content, consistent with a G2 arrest. Levels of anaphase bridges were also elevated, implicating failed chromosome segregation. This was accompanied by an increase in centrosome number, which demonstrates a role for Apc in maintaining euploidy. To address the role of p53 in these processes, we analysed combined loss of Apc and p53, which led to a further increase in proliferation, cell death, DNA damages and repair and a bypass of G2 arrest than was observed with Apc loss. However, we observed only a marginal effect on anaphase bridges and centrosome number, which could be due to increased cell death. Our data therefore establishes, in an in vivo setting, that APC loss leads to a DNA damage signature and genomic instability in the liver and that additional loss of p53 leads to an increase in the DNA damage signal but not to an immediate increase in the genomic instability phenotype."

We combined the Red recombinase system of bacteriophage λ and Isothermal Gibson Assembly for rapid integration of novel DNA constructs into the E. coli chromosome. We identified the flagellar region as a promising region for integration and expression of genetic circuits. We characterised integration and expression at four candidate loci, fliD, fliS, fliT, and fliY, of the E. coli flagellar region 3a. The integration efficiency and expression from the four integrations varied considerably. Integration into fliD and fliS significantly decreased motility, while integration into fliT and fliY had only a minor effect on the motility. None of the integrations had negative effects on the growth of the bacteria. Overall, we found that fliT was the most suitable integration site."
https://openalex.org/W2020797304,"Lipoproteins can induce complement activation resulting in opsonization and binding of these complexes to complement receptors. We investigated the binding of opsonized native LDL and acetylated LDL (acLDL) to the complement receptor 1 (CR1). Binding of complement factors C3b, IgM, C1q, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and properdin to LDL and acLDL were investigated by ELISA. Subsequent binding of opsonized LDL and acLDL to CR1 on CR1-transfected Chinese Hamster Ovarian cells (CHO-CR1) was tested by flow cytometry. Both native LDL and acLDL induced complement activation with subsequent C3b opsonization upon incubation with normal human serum. Opsonized LDL and acLDL bound to CR1. Binding to CHO-CR1 was reduced by EDTA, whereas MgEGTA only reduced the binding of opsonized LDL, but not of acLDL suggesting involvement of the alternative pathway in the binding of acLDL to CR1. In vitro incubations showed that LDL bound C1q, whereas acLDL bound to C1q, IgM, and properdin. MBL did neither bind to LDL nor to acLDL. The relevance of these findings was demonstrated by the fact that ex vivo up-regulation of CR1 on leukocytes was accompanied by a concomitant increased binding of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins to leukocytes without changes in LDL-receptor expression. In conclusion, CR1 is able to bind opsonized native LDL and acLDL. Binding of LDL to CR1 is mediated via the classical pathway, whereas binding of acLDL is mediated via both the classical and alternative pathways. Binding of lipoproteins to CR1 may be of clinical relevance due to the ubiquitous cellular distribution of CR1."

https://openalex.org/W2048711939,"In glioblastoma (GBM), the EGF receptor (EGFR) and Src family kinases (SFKs) contribute to an aggressive phenotype. EGFR may be targeted therapeutically; however, resistance to EGFR-targeting drugs such as Erlotinib and Gefitinib develops quickly. In many GBMs, a truncated form of the EGFR (EGFRvIII) is expressed. Although EGFRvIII is constitutively active and promotes cancer progression, its activity is attenuated compared with EGF-ligated wild-type EGFR, suggesting that EGFRvIII may function together with other signaling receptors in cancer cells to induce an aggressive phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate that in EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells, the urokinase receptor (uPAR) functions as a major activator of SFKs, controlling phosphorylation of downstream targets, such as p130Cas and Tyr-845 in the EGFR in vitro and in vivo. When EGFRvIII expression in GBM cells was neutralized, either genetically or by treating the cells with Gefitinib, paradoxically, the cells demonstrated increased cell migration. The increase in cell migration was explained by a compensatory increase in expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator, which activates uPAR-dependent cell signaling. GBM cells that were selected for their ability to grow in vivo in the absence of EGFRvIII also demonstrated increased cell migration, due to activation of the uPAR signaling system. The increase in GBM cell migration, induced by genetic or pharmacologic targeting of the EGFR, was blocked by Dasatinib, highlighting the central role of SFKs in uPAR-promoted cell migration. These results suggest that compensatory activation of uPAR-dependent cell signaling, in GBM cells treated with targeted therapeutics, may adversely affect the course of the disease by promoting cell migration, which may be associated with tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2140319977,"Superfolder variant of the green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) became a favorite probe for examination of the unfolding–refolding processes of fluorescent proteins with beta-barrel structure owing to its reversible unfolding in comparison with other fluorescent proteins. Its benefit is the proper folding even in fusion constructions with poorly folded polypeptides. We noticed that guanidine thiocyanate affects not only the structure of protein but its chromophore directly. Therefore we studied the influence of ionic denaturants and salts including guanidine thiocyanate, guanidine hydrochloride, sodium chloride and sodium thiocyanate on spectral features of sfGFP. It was shown that moderate amounts of the studied agents do not disrupt sfGFP structure but provoke pronounced alteration of its spectral characteristics. Changes in absorption and CD spectra in visible spectral range indicate the specific binding of SCN− and Cl− anions in the sfGFP chromophore vicinity. The anion binding results in the redistribution of sfGFP molecules with neutral and anionic chromophores. This also hinders the proton transfer in the chromophore excited state, considerably decreasing the fluorescence intensity of sfGFP. Our results indicate that when ionic denaturants are used in the studies of fluorescent protein folding their effect on fluorophore charge state should be taken into account."

The identification of the taxa in section Palmata is based primarily on the degree of leaf blade dissection and the shape of the lobes; however, difficulties in species identification may arise from their significant variation. The aim of this study is to analyze the patterns of variation in leaf blade characteristics within and among populations through population-based sampling covering the entire distribution range of R. palmatum complex. Methods Samples were taken from 2340 leaves from 780 individuals and 44 populations representing the four species, and the degree of leaf blade dissection and the shape of the lobe were measured to yield a set of quantitative data. Furthermore, those data were statistically analyzed. Important Findings The statistical analysis showed that the degree of leaf blade dissection is continuous from lobed to parted, and the shape of the lobe is also continuous from broadly triangular to lanceolate both within and between populations. We suggested that taxa in section Palmata should be considered as one species. Based on the research on the R. palmatum complex, we considered that the quantitative characteristics were greatly influenced by the environment. Therefore, it is not reliable to delimitate the species according to the continuously quantitative vegetative characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2027093652,"A three-dimensional computer model of canopies of the seagrass Amphibolis griffithii was used to investigate the consequences of variations in canopy structure and benthic light environment on leaf-level photosynthetic saturation state. The model was constructed using empirical data of plant morphometrics from a previously conducted shading experiment and validated well to in-situ data on light attenuation in canopies of different densities. Using published values of the leaf-level saturating irradiance for photosynthesis, results show that the interaction of canopy density and canopy-scale photosynthetic response is complex and non-linear, due to the combination of self-shading and the non-linearity of photosynthesis versus irradiance (P-I) curves near saturating irradiance. Therefore studies of light limitation in seagrasses should consider variation in canopy structure and density. Based on empirical work, we propose a number of possible measures for canopy scale photosynthetic response that can be plotted to yield isoclines in the space of canopy density and light environment. These plots can be used to interpret the significance of canopy changes induced as a response to decreases in the benthic light environment: in some cases canopy thinning can lead to an equivalent leaf level light environment, in others physiological changes may also be required but these alone may be inadequate for canopy survival. By providing insight to these processes the methods developed here could be a valuable management tool for seagrass conservation during dredging or other coastal developments."
https://openalex.org/W2059735473,"Eradication of smallpox and discontinuation of the vaccination campaign resulted in an increase in the percentage of unvaccinated individuals, highlighting the need for postexposure efficient countermeasures in case of accidental or deliberate viral release. Intranasal infection of mice with ectromelia virus (ECTV), a model for human smallpox, is curable by vaccination with a high vaccine dose given up to 3 days postexposure. To further extend this protective window and to reduce morbidity, mice were vaccinated postexposure with Vaccinia-Lister, the conventional smallpox vaccine or Modified Vaccinia Ankara, a highly attenuated vaccine in conjunction with TLR3 or TLR9 agonists. We show that co-administration of the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) even 5 days postexposure conferred protection, avoiding the need to increase the vaccination dose. Efficacious treatments prevented death, ameliorated disease symptoms, reduced viral load and maintained tissue integrity of target organs. Protection was associated with significant elevation of serum IFNα and anti-vaccinia IgM antibodies, modulation of IFNγ response, and balanced activation of NK and T cells. TLR9 agonists (CpG ODNs) were less protective than the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C). We show that activation of type 1 IFN by poly(I:C) and protection is achievable even without co-vaccination, requiring sufficient amount of the viral antigens of the infective agent or the vaccine. This study demonstrated the therapeutic potential of postexposure immune modulation by TLR activation, allowing to alleviate the disease symptoms and to further extend the protective window of postexposure vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2085100853,"Neisseria meningitidis adhesin A (NadA) is a meningococcus surface protein thought to assist in the adhesion of the bacterium to host cells. We have previously shown that NadA also promotes bacterial internalization in a heterologous expression system. Here we have used the soluble recombinant NadA (rNadA) lacking the membrane anchor region to characterize its internalization route in Chang epithelial cells. Added to the culture medium, rNadA internalizes through a PI3K-dependent endocytosis process not mediated by the canonical clathrin or caveolin scaffolds, but instead follows an ARF6-regulated recycling pathway previously described for MHC-I. The intracellular pool of rNadA reaches a steady state level within one hour of incubation and colocalizes in endocytic vesicles with MHC-I and with the extracellularly labeled chaperone Hsp90. Treatment with membrane permeated and impermeable Hsp90 inhibitors 17-AAG and FITC-GA respectively, lead to intracellular accumulation of rNadA, strongly suggesting that the extracellular secreted pool of the chaperone is involved in rNadA intracellular trafficking. A significant number of intracellular vesicles containing rNadA recruit Rab11, a small GTPase associated to recycling endosomes, but do not contain transferrin receptor (TfR). Interestingly, cell treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors, including the membrane-impermeable FITC-GA, abolished Rab11-rNadA colocalization but do not interfere with Rab11-TfR colocalization. Collectively, these results are consistent with a model whereby rNadA internalizes into human epithelial cells hijacking the recycling endosome pathway and recycle back to the surface of the cell via an ARF6-dependent, Rab11 associated and Hsp90-regulated mechanism. The present study addresses for the first time a meningoccoccal adhesin mechanism of endocytosis and suggests a possible entry pathway engaged by N. meningitidis in primary infection of human epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1968019372,"The use of anti-toxin human monoclonal antibodies (HMab) as treatment for C. difficile infection has been investigated in animal models and human clinical trials as an alternative to or in combination with traditional antibiotic therapy. While HMab therapy appears to be a promising option, how systemically administered IgG antibodies protect the colonic mucosa during Clostridium difficile infection is unknown. Using the gnotobiotic piglet model of Clostridium difficile infection, we administered a mixture of anti-TcdA and anti-TcdB HMabs systemically to piglets infected with either pathogenic or non-pathogenic C. difficile strains. The HMabs were present throughout the small and large intestinal tissue of both groups, but significant HMabs were present in the lumen of the large intestines only in the pathogenic strain-infected group. Similarly, HMabs measured in the large intestine over a period of 2–4 days following antibody administration were not significantly different over time in the gut mucosa among the groups, but concentrations in the lumen of the large intestine were again consistently higher in the pathogenic strain-infected group. These results indicate that systemically administered HMab IgG reaches the gut mucosa during the course of CDI, protecting the host against systemic intoxication, and that leakage through the damaged colon likely protects the mucosa from further damage, allowing initiation of repair and recovery."

However, the mechanisms underlying the cell’s ability to tolerate dehydration are far from being fully understood. The objective of this study was to highlight, for the first time, the cellular damage to Yarrowia lipolytica as a result of dehydration induced by drying/rehydration and freezing/thawing. Cellular response was evaluated through cell cultivability determined by plate counts, esterase activity and membrane integrity assessed by flow cytometry, and the biochemical composition of cells as determined by FT-IR spectroscopy. The effects of the harvesting time (in the log or stationary phase) and of the addition of a protective molecule, trehalose, were investigated. All freshly harvested cells exhibited esterase activity and no alteration of membrane integrity. Cells freshly harvested in the stationary phase presented spectral contributions suggesting lower nucleic acid content and thicker cell walls, as well as longer lipid chains than cells harvested in the log phase. Moreover, it was found that drying/rehydration induced cell plasma membrane permeabilization, loss of esterase activity with concomitant protein denaturation, wall damage and oxidation of nucleic acids. Plasma membrane permeabilization and loss of esterase activity could be reduced by harvesting in the stationary phase and/or with trehalose addition. Protein denaturation and wall damage could be reduced by harvesting in the stationary phase. In addition, it was shown that measurements of loss of membrane integrity and preservation of esterase activity were suitable indicators of loss and preservation of cultivability, respectively. Conversely, no clear effect of freezing/thawing could be observed, probably because of the favorable operating conditions applied. These results give insights into Y. lipolytica mechanisms of cellular response to dehydration and provide a basis to better understand its ability to tolerate anhydrobiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2103513087,"Canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels are Ca(2+)-permeable nonselective cation channels that are activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The TRPC4 channel is expressed in a punctate distribution in the membrane. To identify the regulating region of the channel trafficking to the membrane, we generated deletion mutants of the TRPC4 channel. We determined that when either region that was downstream of the 20 amino acids of the N terminus or the 700-730 amino acids was deleted, the mutants were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. By coexpression of the wild-type TRPC4 with deletion mutants, we found that the 23-29 amino acids of the N terminus regulate a membrane trafficking. Additionally, by the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) method, we found that the regions downstream of the 99 amino acid region of the N terminus and upstream of the 730 amino acid region in the C terminus produce assembly of the TRPC4 tetramers. We inferred the candidate proteins that regulate or interact with the 23-29 domain of TRPC4."
https://openalex.org/W2041955979,"Most human cancers show chromosomal instability (CIN), but the precise mechanisms remain uncertain. Annexin A2 is frequently overexpressed in human cancers, and its relationship to tumorigenesis is poorly understood. We found that annexin A2 is overexpressed in the nuclei of CIN cells compared with cells with microsatellite instability (MIN). Ectopic annexin A2 expression in MIN cells results in a high level of aneuploidy and induces lagging chromosomes; suppression of annexin A2 in CIN cells reduces such CIN signatures with apoptosis of highly aneuploid cells. Ectopic expression of annexin A2 in MIN cells reduces the expression of centromere proteins. Conversely, annexin A2-knockdown in CIN cells increases the expression of centromere proteins. Moreover, the endogenous expression levels of centromere proteins in CIN cells were greatly reduced compared with MIN cell lines. The reduced expression of centromere proteins likely occurred due to aberrant centromere localization of coilin, a major component of the Cajal bodies. These results suggest that nuclear accumulation of annexin A2 has a crucial role in CIN by disrupting centromere function."
https://openalex.org/W2072517009,"As traditional detergents might destabilize or even denature membrane proteins, amphiphilic polymers have moved into the focus of membrane-protein research in recent years. Thus far, Amphipols are the best studied amphiphilic copolymers, having a hydrophilic backbone with short hydrophobic chains. However, since stabilizing as well as destabilizing effects of the Amphipol belt on the structure of membrane proteins have been described, we systematically analyze the impact of the most commonly used Amphipol A8-35 on the structure and stability of a well-defined transmembrane protein model, the glycophorin A transmembrane helix dimer. Amphipols are not able to directly extract proteins from their native membranes, and detergents are typically replaced by Amphipols only after protein extraction from membranes. As Amphipols form mixed micelles with detergents, a better understanding of Amphipol-detergent interactions is required. Therefore, we analyze the interaction of A8-35 with the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate and describe the impact of the mixed-micelle-like system on the stability of a transmembrane helix dimer. As A8-35 may highly stabilize and thereby rigidify a transmembrane protein structure, modest destabilization by controlled addition of detergents and formation of mixed micellar systems might be helpful to preserve the function of a membrane protein in Amphipol environments."
https://openalex.org/W2074078898,"Zinc-finger, MYND-type containing 10 (ZMYND10), or more commonly called BLU, expression is frequently downregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and many other tumors due to promoter hypermethylation. Functional evidence shows that the BLU gene inhibits tumor growth in animal assays, but the detailed molecular mechanism responsible for this is still not well understood. In current studies, we find that 93.5% of early-stage primary NPC tumors show downregulated BLU expression. Using a PCR array, overexpression of the BLU gene was correlated to the angiogenesis network in NPC cells. Moreover, expression changes of the MMP family, VEGF and TSP1, were often detected in different stages of NPC, suggesting the possibility that BLU may be directly involved in the microenvironment and anti-angiogenic activity in NPC development. Compared with vector-alone control cells, BLU stable transfectants, derived from poorly-differentiated NPC HONE1 cells, suppress VEGF165, VEGF189 and TSP1 expression at both the RNA and protein levels, and significantly reduce the secreted VEGF protein in these cells, reflecting an unknown regulatory mechanism mediated by the BLU gene in NPC. Cells expressing BLU inhibited cellular invasion, migration and tube formation. These in vitro results were further confirmed by in vivo tumor suppression and a matrigel plug angiogenesis assay in nude mice. Tube-forming ability was clearly inhibited, when the BLU gene is expressed in these cells. Up to 70–90% of injected tumor cells expressing increased exogenous BLU underwent cell death in animal assays. Overexpressed BLU only inhibited VEGF165 expression in differentiated squamous NPC HK1 cells, but also showed an anti-angiogenic effect in the animal assay, revealing a complicated mechanism regulating angiogenesis and the microenvironment in different NPC cell lines. Results of these studies indicate that alteration of BLU gene expression influences anti-angiogenesis pathways and is important for the development of NPC."
https://openalex.org/W2070532880,"Dynamins are fission proteins that mediate endocytic and exocytic membrane events and are pharmacological therapeutic targets. These studies investigate whether dynamin II regulates constitutive protein secretion and show for the first time that pharmacological inhibition of dynamin decreases secretion of apolipoprotein E (apoE) and several other proteins constitutively secreted from primary human macrophages. Inhibitors that target recruitment of dynamin to membranes (MiTMABs) or directly target the GTPase domain (Dyngo or Dynole series), dose- and time- dependently reduced the secretion of apoE. SiRNA oligo’s targeting all isoforms of dynamin II confirmed the involvement of dynamin II in apoE secretion. Inhibition of secretion was not mediated via effects on mRNA or protein synthesis. 2D-gel electrophoresis showed that inhibition occurred after apoE was processed and glycosylated in the Golgi and live cell imaging showed that inhibited secretion was associated with reduced post-Golgi movement of apoE-GFP-containing vesicles. The effect was not restricted to macrophages, and was not mediated by the effects of the inhibitors on microtubules. Inhibition of dynamin also altered the constitutive secretion of other proteins, decreasing the secretion of fibronectin, matrix metalloproteinase 9, Chitinase-3-like protein 1 and lysozyme but unexpectedly increasing the secretion of the inflammatory mediator cyclophilin A. We conclude that pharmacological inhibitors of dynamin II modulate the constitutive secretion of macrophage apoE as a class effect, and that their capacity to modulate protein secretion may affect a range of biological processes."

We hypothesized that, if affective perception is influenced by concurrent cognitive load using a working memory task, task-irrelevant emotional distractors would bias subsequent perceptual decision-making on ambiguous facial expression. We found that when either neutral or negative emotional words were presented as task-irrelevant working-memory distractors, participants more frequently reported fearful face perception - but only at the higher emotional intensity levels of morphed faces. Also, the affective perception bias due to negative emotional distractors correlated with a decrease in working memory performance. Taken together, our findings suggest that concurrent working memory load by task-irrelevant distractors has an impact on affective perception of facial expressions."

In this study, we investigated the impact of truncation and commonly-used tags addition into the CT region of human BST-2 on its intracellular trafficking and signaling as well as its anti-HIV-1 function. The CT-truncated BST-2 exhibited potent inhibition on Vpu-defective HIV-1 and even wild-type HIV-1. However, the N-terminal HA-tagged CT-truncated BST-2 retained little antiviral activity and dramatically differed from its original protein in the cell surface level and intracellular localization. Further, we showed that the replacement of the CT domain with a hydrophobic tag altered BST-2 function possibly by preventing its normal vesicular trafficking. Notably, we demonstrated that a positive charged motif ""KRXK"" in the conjunctive region between the cytotail and the transmembrane domain which is conserved in primate BST-2 is important for the protein trafficking and the antiviral function. These results suggest that although the CT of BST-2 is not essential for its antiviral activity, the composition of residues in this region may play important roles in its normal trafficking which subsequently affected its function. These observations provide additional implications for the structure-function model of BST-2."
https://openalex.org/W2030358406,"Background sST2 has been shown to be a risk predictor in heart failure (HF). Our aim was to explore the characteristics and prognostic value of soluble ST2 (sST2) in hospitalized Chinese patients with HF. Methods and Results We consecutively enrolled 1528 hospitalized patients with HF. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis were used to assess the prognostic values of sST2. Adverse events were defined as all-cause death and cardiac transplantation. During a median follow-up of 19.1 months, 325 patients experienced adverse events. Compared with patients free of events, sST2 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with events (P<0.001). Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses showed sST2 concentrations were significantly associated with adverse events (per 1 log unit, adjusted hazard ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval: 1.30 to 1.78, P<0.001). An sST2 concentration in the highest quartiles (>55.6 ng/mL) independently predicted events in comparison to the lowest quartile (≤25.2 ng/mL) when adjusted by multivariable model. In ROC analysis, the area under the curve for sST2 was not different from that for NT-proBNP in short and longer term. Over time, sST2 also improved discrimination and reclassification of risk beyond NT-proBNP. Conclusions sST2 is a strong independent risk predictor in Chinese patients hospitalized with HF and can significantly provide additional prognostic value to NT-proBNP in risk prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2069053341,"Kir channels display voltage-dependent block by cytosolic cations such as Mg2+ and polyamines that causes inward rectification. In fact, cations can regulate K channel activity from both the extracellular and intracellular sides. Previous studies have provided insight into the up-regulation of Kir channel activity by extracellular K+ concentration. In contrast, extracellular Mg2+ has been found to reduce the amplitude of the single-channel current at milimolar concentrations. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of Kir channel blockade by external Mg2+ and the relationship between the Mg2+ blockade and activity potentiation by permeant K+ ions. In this study, we applied an interactive approach between theory and experiment. Electrophysiological recordings on Kir2.2 and its mutants were performed by heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Our results confirmed that extracellular Mg2+ could reduce heterologously expressed WT Kir2.2 currents in a voltage dependent manner. The kinetics of inhibition and recovery of Mg2+ exhibit a 3∼4s time constant. Molecular dynamics simulation results revealed a Mg2+ binding site located at the extracellular mouth of Kir2.2 that showed voltage-dependent Mg2+ binding. The mutants, G119D, Q126E and H128D, increased the number of permeant K+ ions and reduced the voltage-dependent blockade of Kir2.2 by extracellular Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W1974081756,"Background A major challenges in the analysis of large and complex biomedical data is to develop an approach for 1) identifying distinct subgroups in the sampled populations, 2) characterizing their relationships among subgroups, and 3) developing a prediction model to classify subgroup memberships of new samples by finding a set of predictors. Each subgroup can represent different pathogen serotypes of microorganisms, different tumor subtypes in cancer patients, or different genetic makeups of patients related to treatment response. Methods This paper proposes a composite model for subgroup identification and prediction using biclusters. A biclustering technique is first used to identify a set of biclusters from the sampled data. For each bicluster, a subgroup-specific binary classifier is built to determine if a particular sample is either inside or outside the bicluster. A composite model, which consists of all binary classifiers, is constructed to classify samples into several disjoint subgroups. The proposed composite model neither depends on any specific biclustering algorithm or patterns of biclusters, nor on any classification algorithms. Results The composite model was shown to have an overall accuracy of 97.4% for a synthetic dataset consisting of four subgroups. The model was applied to two datasets where the sample’s subgroup memberships were known. The procedure showed 83.7% accuracy in discriminating lung cancer adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma subtypes, and was able to identify 5 serotypes and several subtypes with about 94% accuracy in a pathogen dataset. Conclusion The composite model presents a novel approach to developing a biclustering-based classification model from unlabeled sampled data. The proposed approach combines unsupervised biclustering and supervised classification techniques to classify samples into disjoint subgroups based on their associated attributes, such as genotypic factors, phenotypic outcomes, efficacy/safety measures, or responses to treatments. The procedure is useful for identification of unknown species or new biomarkers for targeted therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1975595696,"Both podocalyxin (PODX) and β-catenin (β-cat) signaling reportedly play important roles in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) progression. In this study, we for the first time explored crosstalk between PODX and β-cat signaling in GBM cells, and assessed its impact on GBM cell invasion and proliferation. Stable overexpression of PODX in LN-229 and U-118 MG human GBM cells increased the soluble/intracellular β-cat level, TOPflash luciferase reporter activity, the mRNA levels of β-cat signaling target genes, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expression/activity, and cell invasion and proliferation, which was abolished by selective p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor PD169316 and selective β-cat signaling inhibitor CCT031374. On the other hand, stable knockdown of PODX in LN-229 and U-118 MG cells decreased the soluble β-cat level, TOPflash luciferase reporter activity, the mRNA levels of β-cat signaling target genes, MMP9 expression/activity, and cell invasion and proliferation, which was completely reversed by overexpression of a constitutively active β-cat mutant. In addition, overexpression of PODX induced p38 MAPK activity and inactivating phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) at serine 389 in LN-229 and U-118 MG cells, which was abolished by PD169316, but not CCT031374; knockdown of PODX decreased p38 MAPK activity and inactivating phosphorylation of GSK-3β at serine 389 in both cell lines, which was not significantly affected by overexpression of constitutively active β-cat. In conclusion, this study indicates that PODX promotes GBM cell invasion and proliferation by elevating the soluble β-cat level/β-cat signaling through the p38 MAPK/GSK-3β pathway. Uncovering the PODX/β-cat signaling axis adds new insights not only into the biological functions of PODX and β-cat, but also into the molecular mechanisms underlying GBM progression."
https://openalex.org/W1977715848,"Arsenic (III) methyltransferase (AS3MT) is a cysteine (Cys)-rich enzyme that catalyzes the biomethylation of arsenic. To investigate how these crucial Cys residues promote catalysis, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) to analyze Cys residues in recombinant human arsenic (III) methyltransferase (hAS3MT). We detected two disulfide bonds, Cys250-Cys32 and Cys368-Cys369, in hAS3MT. The Cys250-Cys32 disulfide bond was reduced by glutathione (GSH) or other disulfide bond reductants before the enzymatic methylation of arsenite (iAs3+). In addition to exposing residues around the active sites, cleavage of the Cys250-Cys32 pair modulated the conformation of hAS3MT. This adjustment may stabilize the binding of S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) and favor iAs3+ binding to hAS3MT. Additionally, we observed the intermediate of Cys250-S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), suggesting that Cys250 is involved in the transmethylation. In recovery experiments, we confirmed that trivalent arsenicals were substrates for hAS3MT, methylation of arsenic occurred on the enzyme, and an intramolecular disulfide bond might be formed after iAs3+ was methylated to dimethylarsinous acid (DMA3+). In this work, we clarified both the functional roles of GSH and the crucial Cys residues in iAs3+ methylation catalyzed by hAS3MT."
https://openalex.org/W2152339975,"Mitochondrion plays a central role in diverse biological processes in most eukaryotes, and its dysfunctions are critically involved in a large number of diseases and the aging process. A systematic identification of mitochondrial proteomes and characterization of functional linkages among mitochondrial proteins are fundamental in understanding the mechanisms underlying biological functions and human diseases associated with mitochondria. Here we present a database MitProNet which provides a comprehensive knowledgebase for mitochondrial proteome, interactome and human diseases. First an inventory of mammalian mitochondrial proteins was compiled by widely collecting proteomic datasets, and the proteins were classified by machine learning to achieve a high-confidence list of mitochondrial proteins. The current version of MitProNet covers 1124 high-confidence proteins, and the remainders were further classified as middle- or low-confidence. An organelle-specific network of functional linkages among mitochondrial proteins was then generated by integrating genomic features encoded by a wide range of datasets including genomic context, gene expression profiles, protein-protein interactions, functional similarity and metabolic pathways. The functional-linkage network should be a valuable resource for the study of biological functions of mitochondrial proteins and human mitochondrial diseases. Furthermore, we utilized the network to predict candidate genes for mitochondrial diseases using prioritization algorithms. All proteins, functional linkages and disease candidate genes in MitProNet were annotated according to the information collected from their original sources including GO, GEO, OMIM, KEGG, MIPS, HPRD and so on. MitProNet features a user-friendly graphic visualization interface to present functional analysis of linkage networks. As an up-to-date database and analysis platform, MitProNet should be particularly helpful in comprehensive studies of complicated biological mechanisms underlying mitochondrial functions and human mitochondrial diseases. MitProNet is freely accessible at http://bio.scu.edu.cn:8085/MitProNet."
https://openalex.org/W2067491379,"Large-scale daily commuting data were combined with detailed geographical information system (GIS) data to analyze the loss of transport efficiency caused by drivers' uncoordinated routing in urban road networks. We used Price of Anarchy (POA) to quantify the loss of transport efficiency and found that both volume and distribution of human mobility demand determine the POA. In order to reduce POA, a small number of highways require considerable decreases in traffic, and their neighboring arterial roads need to attract more traffic. The magnitude of the adjustment in traffic flow can be estimated using the fundamental measure traffic flow only, which is widely available and easy to collect. Surprisingly, the most congested roads or the roads with largest traffic flow were not those requiring the most reduction of traffic. This study can offer guidance for the optimal control of urban traffic and facilitate improvements in the efficiency of transport networks."
