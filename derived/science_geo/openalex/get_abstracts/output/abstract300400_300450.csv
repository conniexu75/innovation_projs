https://openalex.org/W2053811834,"The study of climate and climate change is hindered by a lack of information on the effect of clouds on the radiation balance of the earth, referred to as the cloud-radiative forcing. Quantitative estimates of the global distributions of cloud-radiative forcing have been obtained from the spaceborne Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) launched in 1984. For the April 1985 period, the global shortwave cloud forcing [-44.5 watts per square meter (W/m2)] due to the enhancement of planetary albedo, exceeded in magnitude the longwave cloud forcing (31.3 W/m2) resulting from the greenhouse effect of clouds. Thus, clouds had a net cooling effect on the earth. This cooling effect is large over the mid- and high-latitude oceans, with values reaching -100 W/m2. The monthly averaged longwave cloud forcing reached maximum values of 50 to 100 W/m2 over the convectively disturbed regions of the tropics. However, this heating effect is nearly canceled by a correspondingly large negative shortwave cloud forcing, which indicates the delicately balanced state of the tropics. The size of the observed net cloud forcing is about four times as large as the expected value of radiative forcing from a doubling of CO2. The shortwave and longwave components of cloud forcing are about ten times as large as those for a CO2 doubling. Hence, small changes in the cloud-radiative forcing fields can play a significant role as a climate feedback mechanism. For example, during past glaciations a migration toward the equator of the field of strong, negative cloud-radiative forcing, in response to a similar migration of cooler waters, could have significantly amplified oceanic cooling and continental glaciation."
https://openalex.org/W1964640531,"In 1986 more than 8 million liters of crude oil spilled into a complex region of mangroves, seagrasses, and coral reefs just east of the Caribbean entrance to the Panama Canal. This was the largest recorded spill into coastal habitats in the tropical Americas. Many population of plants and animals in both oiled and unoiled sites had been studied previously, thereby providing an unprecedented measure of ecological variation before the spill. Documenation of the spread of oil and its biological begun immediately. Intertidal mangroves, algae, and associated invertebrates were covered by oil and died soon after. More surprisingly, there was also extensive mortality of shallow subtidal reef corals and infauna of seagrass beds. After 1.5 years only some organisms in areas exposed to the open sea have recovered."
https://openalex.org/W2009433417,"Evidence suggests that superconducting, orthorhombic YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6+x)+ (x greater, similar 0.5) is always produced by oxidation of the oxygen-deficient, tetragonal form (x less, similar 0.5) of this phase (commonly referred to as 123). A synthetic route whereby solution-derived, carbon-free precursors are decomposed at 650 degrees to 700 degrees C in inert atmosphere to yield tetragonal 123 is now available. Appropriate precursors include hydrated oxides derived from the hydrolysis of organometallic solutions and aqueous solution-derived hyponitrites. Subsequent oxidation of the tetragonal phase at 400 degrees C results in submicrometer particles of orthorhombic 123. Superconductivity (T(c) onset approximately 87 K) has been confirmed in these materials by both Meissner effect and specific-heat measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2019641762,"Multiphoton resonance ionization has been combined with energetic ion bombardment to examine dopant concentrations ofindium on the surface of silicon. The results yield a linear relation between the indium concentration and the known bulk values and a detection limit of 9 parts per trillion, at a mass resolution exceeding 160. This measurement, which surpasses the limits of any previous surface analysis by a factor of 100, has been made possible with an experimental configuration that optimizes sampling and detection efficiency while reducing background noise to virtually zero. During the analysis, submonolayer quantities of the surface are removed, so that as few as 180 surface atoms may be counted."
