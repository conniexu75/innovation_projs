https://openalex.org/W1969063564,"We have shown previously that cell adhesion or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) promotes the <i>in vivo</i> association of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) with phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. <i>In vitro</i> experiments indicated that this interaction was mediated by the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. Here we report data suggesting that the major autophosphorylation site of FAK (Tyr-397) is the binding site for the SH2 domains of p85 <i>in vitro</i> and is also required for the association of FAK with PI 3-kinase <i>in vivo</i>. We also show that Tyr-397 is responsible for the increased FAK:PI 3-kinase association upon PDGF stimulation, implying that no additional site of FAK was involved in its binding to PI 3-kinase after PDGF stimulation. Finally, we present evidence that the interaction of PI 3-kinase with Tyr-397 of FAK stimulates its activity. Together, these results suggest that FAK activation and autophosphorylation at Tyr-397 may lead to its association with PI 3-kinase through the SH2 domains of p85, which can subsequently activate PI 3-kinase during cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1993852996,"The discovery of several hundred different protein kinases involved in highly diverse cellular signaling pathways is in stark contrast to the much smaller number of known modulators of cell signaling. Of these, the H series protein kinase inhibitors (1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7), N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H8) N-[2-(p-Bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H89)) are frequently used to block signaling pathways in studies of cellular regulation. To elucidate inhibition mechanisms at atomic resolution and to enable structure-based drug design of potential therapeutic modulators of signaling pathways, we determined the crystal structures of corresponding complexes with the cAPK catalytic subunit. Complexes with H7 and H8 (2.2 Å) and with H89 (2.3 Å) define the binding mode of the isoquinoline-sulfonamide derivatives in the ATP-binding site while demonstrating effects of ligand-induced structural change. Specific interactions between the enzyme and the inhibitors include the isoquinoline ring nitrogen ligating to backbone amide of Val-123 and an inhibitor side chain amide bonding to the backbone carbonyl of Glu-170. The conservation of the ATP-binding site of protein kinases allows evaluation of factors governing general selectivity of these inhibitors among kinases. These results should assist efforts in the design of protein kinase inhibitors with specific properties.

INTRODUCTIONIsoquinolinesulfonamide protein kinase inhibitors of the H series are among the most widely used inhibitors of Ser/Thr kinases and are indispensable in cellular and signal transduction research. Protein phosphorylation (central to cellular regulation) is mediated by the individual action of several hundred different protein kinases. Recent progress in the understanding of the highly complex cellular signaling networks depends largely on the availability and quality of specific agents that interfere with the pathways under investigation. The usefulness of a protein kinase inhibitor is defined by its ability to permeate cell membranes, its solubility, and its relative degree of specificity. Each year hundreds of publications describe work using isoquinolinesulfonamide inhibitors, despite the fact that the mode of specific inhibition by these compounds is not completely understood.We have used the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK), 1The abbreviations used are: cAPKcAMP-dependent protein kinaseH71-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazineH8N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamideH89N-[2-(p-Bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamideCKi-1truncated form of protein kinase CK-1CKI-7N-[2-aminoethyl]-5-chloro-isoquinoline-8-sulfonamideMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidChaps3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diolPKIprotein kinase inhibitor. which binds many H series inhibitors, as a model system to investigate the factors governing inhibitor binding and specificity.

https://openalex.org/W2043046936,"Articular cartilage extracts were prepared to characterize protein fractions with in vivo chondrogenic activity (Chang, S., Hoang, B., Thomas, J. T., Vukicevic, S., Luyten, F. P., Ryba, N. J. P., Kozak, C. A., Reddi, A. H., and Moos, M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 28227-28234). Trypsin digestion of highly purified chondrogenic protein fractions allowed the identification of several unique peptides by amino acid sequencing. We discovered a novel cDNA encoding a deduced 36-kDa protein by using degenerate oligonucleotide primers derived from a 30-residue peptide in reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions. Its N-terminal domain showed ~50% amino acid identity to the corresponding region of the Drosophila gene frizzled, which has been implicated in the specification of hair polarity during development. Hydropathy and structural analyses of the open reading frame revealed the presence of a signal peptide and a hydrophobic domain followed by multiple potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites and a serine-rich C terminus. Cell fractionation studies of primary bovine articular chondrocytes and transfected COS cells suggested that the protein is membrane-associated. In situ hybridization and immunostaining of human embryonic sections demonstrated predominant expression surrounding the chondrifying bone primordia and subsequently in the chondrocytes of the epiphyses in a graded distribution that decreased toward the primary ossification center. Transcripts were present in the craniofacial structures but not in the vertebral bodies. Because it is expressed primarily in the cartilaginous cores of developing long bones during embryonic and fetal development (6-13 weeks) and is homologous to the polarity-determining gene frizzled, we believe that this gene, which we named frzb, is involved in morphogenesis of the mammalian skeleton.

Its N-terminal domain showed ~50% amino acid identity to the corresponding region of the Drosophila gene frizzled, which has been implicated in the specification of hair polarity during development. Hydropathy and structural analyses of the open reading frame revealed the presence of a signal peptide and a hydrophobic domain followed by multiple potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites and a serine-rich C terminus. Cell fractionation studies of primary bovine articular chondrocytes and transfected COS cells suggested that the protein is membrane-associated. In situ hybridization and immunostaining of human embryonic sections demonstrated predominant expression surrounding the chondrifying bone primordia and subsequently in the chondrocytes of the epiphyses in a graded distribution that decreased toward the primary ossification center. Transcripts were present in the craniofacial structures but not in the vertebral bodies. Because it is expressed primarily in the cartilaginous cores of developing long bones during embryonic and fetal development (6-13 weeks) and is homologous to the polarity-determining gene frizzled, we believe that this gene, which we named frzb, is involved in morphogenesis of the mammalian skeleton."

In vivo genomic footprinting of the mouse metallothionein-I promoter after treatment of Hepa cells with hydrogen peroxide, tert-butylhydroquinone, or zinc suggested a rapid increase in occupancy of the metal response elements. More subtle changes also occurred in the constitutive genomic footprint at the composite major late transcription factor/antioxidant response element. This element may, in part, mediate induction by hydrogen peroxide. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated a rapid (30 min) increase in the DNA binding activity of metal-responsive transcription factor-1 in Hepa cells treated with any of these inducers. In control cells, upstream stimulatory factor binding with the major late transcription factor site, and a nuclear protein complex distinct from AP-1, but specific for the antioxidant response element, were detected. The amounts of these complexes were not altered after these treatments. These studies indicate that metal-responsive transcription factor-1 plays a role in activating mouse metallothionein-I gene transcription in response to reactive oxygen species.

Metallothioneins (MT) constitute a family of small cysteine-rich heavy metal-binding proteins. MT-I and -II display a broad tissue distribution and were initially characterized for their ability to sequester and protect cells against heavy metals (3Andrews G.K. Prog. Food Nutr.

A hallmark of MT-I and MT-II genes is their rapid transcriptional induction both in vivo and in vitro by agents against which MT protects. Essential to induction by heavy metals are cis-acting sequences termed metal response elements (MRE) (8Cizewski Culotta V. Hamer D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 9Stuart G.W. Searle P.F. Chen H.Y. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The metal-responsive transcription factor, termed MTF-I, that binds to MREs and activates MT gene transcription has been cloned from mouse and human (11Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 12Brugnera E. Georgiev O. Radtke F. Heuchel R. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3167-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which metals regulate transcription through MTF-1 are poorly understood. It is well documented that agents that redox cycle, such as paraquat, agents that deplete glutathione, such as diethylmaleate, and inflammatory substances, such as lipopolysaccharide and cytokines, induce ROS production (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4389) Google Scholar) and MT (13Bauman J.W. Liu J. Liu Y.P. Klaassen C.D. Toxicol. Appl.

We found that transcription of the mouse MT-I gene in mouse Hepa cells is rapidly induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (15Dalton T.D. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In that study transient transfection analysis using the mouse MT-I promoter and isolated transcription elements driving the CAT reporter gene implicated MREs and a composite major late transcription factor/antioxidant response element (MLTF/ARE) in the response of the MT-I gene to ROS. The MLTF binding site has been shown to effect basal transcription from the mouse MT-I promoter (16Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and upstream stimulatory factor (USF), a member of the bHLH-bZip protein superfamily, can bind to this site (17Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 18Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The ARE is an element best characterized in the promoters of phase II drug metabolizing enzyme genes and directs response to electrophilic xenobiotics and H2O2 (19Jaiswal A.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The transcription factor(s) responsible for transactivation through the ARE is not clear. Some reports implicate AP-1 complexes and some a novel factor (19Jaiswal A.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the present study, we employ transient transfection analysis, in vivo footprint analysis, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to elucidate the transcription factors involved in the transcriptional response of the mouse MT-I gene to ROS. Our results indicate that pro-oxidant conditions activate mouse MTF-1 binding activity and MT-I gene transcription during oxidative stress. Hepa cells were cultured and treated by direct addition to the culture medium from concentrated stocks of H2O2 and ZnSO4 as described (15Dalton T.D. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). tert-Butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) and β-naphthoflavone (β-NF) were dissolved in Me2SO as a 1000 times concentrated stock. Hepa cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method and reporter gene activity (CAT) was normalized to β-gal activity by cotransfection of SV-β-gal as described (15Dalton T.D. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated, size fractionated by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized with 32P-labeled mouse MT-I cRNA probe as described (15Dalton T.D. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 20Dalton T.D. Kover K. Dey S.K. Andrews G.K. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The probe had a specific activity of approximately 2 × 109 cpm/μg. The construction of fusion genes used in this study has been described previously (15Dalton T.D. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). After treatment with the indicated inducer, Hepa cells were exposed to 0.1% dimethyl sulfate (Aldrich) for 2 min at 37°C; genomic DNA was purified and subjected to piperidine (Aldrich) cleavage at positions of methylated guanines as described (21Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 179-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cleaved DNA (2 μg) was then amplified by ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR), using mouse MT-I promoter-specific primers that have been described previously (22Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 23Garrity P.A. Wold B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), except that the following primer (GATAGGCCGTAATATCGGGGAAAGCAC) was used as the third primer in LM-PCR. Reaction conditions were as described (22Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 23Garrity P.A. Wold B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), with the following exceptions. 1) The initial primer extension reaction contained 2 units of Vent Exo DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and denaturation was conducted for 5 min at 95°C, annealing was for 30 min at 60°C and primer extension was for 10 min at 72°C; 2) during PCR, denaturation, annealing, and primer extension temperatures were as above; 3) the labeling reaction contained 2.3 pmol of end-labeled oligonucleotide (4-8 × 106 cpm/pmol) and was denatured for 3.5 min at 95°C, annealed for 2 min at 66°C, and extended for 10 min at 76°C; and 4) at the end of the labeling cycle, one half of the sample was frozen at −20°C for later use, and the remainder was fractionated on a 6% DNA sequencing gel. Based on band intensities in each lane of the initial sequencing gel, a second gel was run in which the radioactivity in each lane was “normalized.” Samples with low signal were subjected to another cycle of labeling before further analysis. Dried sequencing gels were exposed to a phosphor screen, which was scanned with a Phosphorimager SI, and quantitated using the ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To adjust for variations in the amount of radioactivity among the samples, the amount of radioactivity in bases within the footprinted region (base) was compared with that of bases flanking the footprinted region (standard), and the ratio (Pbase/Pstandard) was calculated for each base as described (24Brenowitz M. Senear D.F. Shea M.A. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 132-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Data were verified for consistency by examining the ratios obtained using several standard bases. Protection or hypersensitivity of individual guanines was determined by subtracting the ratio for that base in the uninduced in vivo control sample, from that in the induced sample, and the difference was divided by the ratio of the in vivo control. Nuclear extracts were prepared with modifications of the method of Dignam et al. (25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9129) Google Scholar). After treatment, cells (1 × 108) were placed on ice, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were scraped off the dish in 5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, and collected by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of cell lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and immediately centrifuged as above. Cells were resuspended in 2 times the original packed cell volume of cell lysis buffer, allowed to swell on ice for 10 min, and homogenized with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer (B pestle). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 3300 × g for 15 min at 4°C, the supernatant was removed and the nuclei were suspended, using 6 strokes of a Teflon-glass homogenizer, in 3 volumes (about 750 μl) of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 400 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25% glycerol). The nuclear suspension was stirred for 30 min on ice, and then centrifuged at 89,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected, and concentrated in a Microcon3 microconcentrator (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 3 h at 4°C. The concentrated extract was diluted in half with diluent buffer (extraction buffer without KCl) and frozen in aliquots at −80°C. Proteins were determined using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) with rabbit IgG as a standard. A nuclear extract from TPA-treated NIH 3T3 cells, and antibodies against the c-jun family and USF (recognizes both USF-1 and USF-2; 26Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biochemicals (Santa Cruz, CA). Nuclear proteins (5-10 μg) were incubated in binding reaction buffer containing 12 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 12% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 μg of dI-dC/μg of protein, 2-4 fmol of end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (5000 cpm/fmol) (27Fried M.G. Electrophoresis. 1989; 10: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and where indicated 60 μM ZnSO4, in a total volume of 20 μl for, unless otherwise stated, 20 min at room temperature. In binding site competition experiments, binding reactions also contained a 250-fold molar excess of the indicated unlabeled oligonucleotide. In antibody competition experiments, the indicated antiserum (1 μg) was added to the complete binding reaction and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The oligonucleotide sequences were as follows (bold bases denote the functional core, and underlined bases denote mutations). Protein-DNA complexes were separated electrophoretically at 4°C in a 4% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide/80:1) at 15 V/cm. The gel was polymerized in, and the running buffer consisted of 0.19 M glycine (pH 8.5), 25 mM Tris, 0.5 mM EDTA, and where indicated 60 μM ZnSO4. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and labeled complexes were detected by autoradiography. The effects of digestion with thrombin or trypsin on MRE-s binding activity were examined as follows. Nuclear proteins (30 μg) from H2O2- and ZnSO4-treated Hepa cells (1 h after treatment) and recombinant MTF-1 (0.25 μl of a 50-μl reaction described below) were added to the complete binding reaction containing labeled MRE-s and incubated at 4°C for 20 min to allow DNA binding. In some binding reactions, a solution of 2.5% trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.) diluted 1:100 in Hanks' balanced salt solution was added (1 μl/20 μl binding reaction), and they were incubated for 15 min at 37°C. Soybean trypsin inhibitor (Life Technologies, Inc.; 100 μg in 1 μl) was then added, and the samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. In other binding reactions, thrombin (Boehringer Mannheim) was added (8 × 10−3 units/2 μl) and the mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. These samples were immediately chilled on ice and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Specificity of the binding was confirmed by competition with excess unlabeled MRE-s, and protein-DNA complexes were separated electrophoretically, as described above. A cDNA clone for mouse MTF-1 was generated using reverse transcriptase-PCR from mouse liver RNA with the following primers. Primers contained XbaI or ClaI sites (bold bases), plus two terminal stabilizing bases, for ease of cloning and they directed amplification of the complete coding sequence of mouse MTF-1. Reverse transcriptase-PCR was conducted as described (33Lee D.K. Fu K. Liang L. Dalton T. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 43: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using mouse liver total RNA. The MTF-1 cDNA was cloned between the XbaI-ClaI sites of pGEM7 (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI) and sequenced using Sequenase (Stratagene). MTF-1 was synthesized in vitro using a TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Biotech), containing 1 μg of the MTF-1 plasmid, according to the manufacturer's suggestions. We previously reported that transcriptional induction of the mouse MT-I gene by H2O2 requires the promoter region between −153 and −42, relative to the transcription start point (15Dalton T.D. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This region contains five MREs and a composite MLTF(USF)/ARE. We also reported that four or five tandem copies of these elements independently conferred response to H2O2 on a reporter gene. In contrast, only MREs conferred response to zinc. To further examine the regulation of MT-I gene expression by oxidative stress, the effects of the planar aromatic compound β-NF and the phenolic antioxidant tBHQ on MT-I gene expression were determined. β-NF is a bifunctional inducer that activates both phase I (e.g. CYP1a1 P-450) and phase II (e.g. glutathione S-transferase Ya) detoxification systems, whereas tBHQ is monofunctional and induces phase II genes (34Pinkus R. Weiner L.M. Daniel V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 35Prestera T. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8965-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 36Yoshioka K. Deng T. Cavigelli M. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4972-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). β-NF must be metabolized to yield an electrophilic compound which then activates gene expression (37Friling R.S. Bensimon A. Tichauer Y. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6258-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 38Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14648-14653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, tBHQ undergoes auto-oxidation to form a redox-active semiquinone anion radical (39Schilderman P.A. van Maanen J.M. Smeets E.J. ten Hoor F. Kleinjans J.C. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 40Bergmann B. Dohrmann J.K. Kahl R. Toxicology. 1992; 74: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Incubation of Hepa cells in medium containing β-NF (50 or 100 μM) did not induce MT-I mRNA, which suggested that this compound may not be metabolized by these Hepa cells. Thus, effects of β-NF were not further examined. In contrast, tBHQ caused a concentration-dependent induction of MT-I mRNA (Fig. 1), and 400 μM tBHQ caused an approximately 40-fold increase in MT-I mRNA by 8 h. Treatment of cells with tBHQ also dramatically induced heme oxygenase-1 mRNA, but did not effect the levels of β-actin or Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase mRNAs (data not shown). tBHQ also induces MT-I mRNA in NIH 3T3 and L929 cells (data not shown). Transient transfection assays were performed in Hepa cells to delineate the promoter elements involved in response of the MT-I gene to tBHQ (Fig. 2). A construct containing 153 base pairs of the MT-I promoter fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene was responsive to tBHQ, and removal of the region distal to −43 completely abolished response. Response of the 153-base pair promoter to tBHQ was submaximal at 200 μM and apparently maximal at 400 μM tBHQ. The higher concentration was moderately cytotoxic in the transfected cells. Selective deletion of the MLTF/ARE (−100 to −89) in −153-CAT only modestly reduced response to a tBHQ (p < 0.04; 200 μM tBHQ). In contrast, deletion of this region reduces response to H2O2 by 50% (15Dalton T.D. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These results suggested that response of the MT-I promoter to tBHQ is mediated predominantly by MREs. To further examine this possibility, multiple copies of MRE-d (MRE-d′5) or MLTF/ARE (MLTF/ARE4) were analyzed for the ability to confer response to tBHQ on a minimal promoter (−42 base pairs of the mouse MT-I promoter) driving CAT. Treatment of Hepa cells with 200 μM tBHQ resulted in 4.4-fold increase in CAT activity from the MRE-d′5-CAT construct, but did not result in significant induction of the MLTF/ARE4-CAT construct. Treatment with tBHQ did not increase CAT activity from an RSV-CAT vector or from the minimal MT promoter construct (−42). These results demonstrate the mouse MT-I gene is transcriptionally regulated by tBHQ, consistent with a role for ROS in regulating MT gene expression, and suggest that this induction is mediated by MREs. In vivo genomic footprint analysis was accomplished by LM-PCR of bases −200 to −30 in the MT-I promoter (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Cells, before or after treatment with an inducer, were incubated with dimethyl sulfate, and genomic DNA was isolated, cleaved with piperidine, and MT-I promoter fragments were specifically amplified. Guanine residues involved in protein-DNA interactions were visualized as either less intense (protected) or more intense (hypersensitive) compared with invariant G residues in the promoter, and by comparison with DNA from untreated control cells. Naked genomic DNA was methylated and similarly amplified to provide a G-ladder and to reveal constitutive interactions in the MT-I promoter in control cells. Footprint experiments with each inducer were conducted several times, and the results were reproducible.Fig. 4Quantitation of the in vivo genomic footprints over MRE-c, MRE-d, and MLTF/ARE after H2O2, tBHQ, and zinc treatment of Hepa cells. Hepa cells were treated with 2.5 mM H2O2 for 0.5 h, or 400 μM tBHQ or 100 μM zinc for 1 h, and genomic footprints in the MT-I promoter are shown in Fig. 3. These samples represent the treatment time and dosage for maximal occupancy of the MREs with these inducers. For these selected DNA samples, the regions of the LM-PCR sequencing gel corresponding to MRE-c (panel a), MRE-d (panel b), and MLTF/ARE (panel c) are shown enlarged (A). Band intensities were quantitated by phosphoimage analysis of dried gels and protection of ≥20% and hypersensitivity of ≥40% of individual guanine residues in treated cells compared with those in control cells were calculated as detailed under “Experimental Procedures” and are shown for both the sense and antisense strands (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In control cells, a strong constitutive footprint was evident on the guanine-rich sense strand (Fig. 3A) over an Sp1 binding site (−187 to −179); in addition, there was a constitutive footprint over the MLTF/ARE (Figs. 3, A and B, and 4c). Similar results have been reported previously (41Mueller P.R. Salser S.J. Wold B. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 412-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast, little constitutive footprinting of MRE core sequences, with the exception of a weak footprint over MRE-d, was detected (Figs. 3, A and B, and 4b). An apparently stronger constitutive footprint over MRE-d was reported previously (41Mueller P.R. Salser S.J. Wold B. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 412-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which may reflect the cell type or culture conditions in those experiments. Please note that the histograms do not indicate constitutive footprints, as the data were derived by comparisons of footprints from induced cells with those from uninduced cells (in vivo control). After treatment with H2O2, tBHQ, or zinc, footprints were rapidly induced over five of the MREs (Fig. 3, A and B). Footprinted regions at the time of maximal occupancy are shown enlarged and quantitated for MRE-c and MRE-d (Fig. 4, panels a and b), because these two MREs were more strongly footprinted. In contrast, the footprint over MRE-e was weak. It is noteworthy that G residues within each MRE core sequence (TGCRCnC) that are functionally essential (28Culotta V.C. Hamer D.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) were protected from methylation. Remarkably, with all three inducers the footprint patterns were essentially identical over the MREs, but the temporal appearance of these footprints differed. Footprints induced by H2O2 appeared within 30 min of treatment, but were absent by 5 h. This is consistent with the rapid, transient induction of MT-I gene transcription by H2O2 (15Dalton T.D. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In contrast, the MRE footprints induced by 200 μM tBHQ were detected by 1 h, but were maintained for at least 5 h. These footprints were notably less intense than those induced by H2O2 or zinc. However, 400 μM tBHQ, which maximally induced MT mRNA (Fig. 1), induced strong and prolonged footprints over these MREs. It is certainly conceivable that MRE occupancy and subsequent transcriptional activation of the MT gene are both modulated. In addition to footprints induced over MREs, all of these treatments also induced footprints over the MLTF/ARE region (Fig. 3, A and B; Fig. 4, panel c). Footprint patterns with the various inducers were qualitatively similar, but quantitatively distinct. Major changes in guanine methylation were noted in residues immediately upstream and within the MLTF binding site and immediately downstream of the ARE. The footprint over the MLTF/ARE induced by H2O2 was transient, while those induced by tBHQ and zinc were prolonged. It is somewhat surprising that zinc induced a footprint over the MLTF/ARE; however, a similar result was reported previously (41Mueller P.R. Salser S.J. Wold B. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 412-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This region does not contain an MRE core sequence, and an oligonucleotide with this sequence does not interact with MTF-1 (see below). These results revealed little evidence of protein interactions with guanine residues within the ARE functional core (GTGACnnnGC) (31Nguyen T. Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

To reduce the complexity of analyzing MTF-1 binding to the MRE, we employed a consensus MRE oligonucleotide (MRE-s) that is a strong MTF-1 binding site, but does not bind Sp1 (11Radtke F. Heuchel R.

Here we report the cloning by expression of a novel NPY receptor subtype from a rat hypothalamus cDNA library. The novel receptor, referred to as the NPY Y5 receptor, has a transcript of approximately 2.6 kilobases with an open reading frame of 1335 base pairs that encodes a 445-amino acid protein.

However, the feeding response elicited by NPY and its peptide analogues cannot be fully accounted for by the pharmacological profile of these receptors.

The pharmacological profile of this receptor suggests that it is the NPY feeding receptor. neuropeptide Y peptide YY pancreatic polypeptide phosphate-buffered saline polymerase chain reaction base pair(s). Total RNA was obtained from rat hypothalami, from which poly(A) RNA was isolated (Promega PolyATtract System 1000 kit). A cDNA expression library was prepared using 25 μg of poly(A) RNA, using an oligo(dT) anchor primer for reverse transcription. The cDNAs were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The library contained 5.3 × 105 independent recombinants with an average insert size of 2.6 kilobases. The rat hypothalamus cDNA library was plated onto LB/Ampicillin plates in pools of 1,000 independent clones, and DNA was prepared from these pools. 2 μg of plasmid DNA from each pool was transfected into COS-7 cells, which had been plated into flaskette chambers (Nunc, Inc.) using 10 μl of Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). 48 h after transfection the [125I]PYY binding assay was performed as follows: cells were first treated with 2 ml of binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mg/ml bacitracin, and 0.4 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) at room temperature for 15 min, followed by a 90-min incubation at room temperature with 100 pM porcine [125I]PYY (Amersham Corp.). Cells were washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer without ligand and once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were fixed with 1% cold glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed once with cold PBS/0.5 M Tris, pH 7.5, and incubated in PBS/0.5 M Tris, pH 7.5, for 15 min at 4°C. After washing once more with cold PBS, the slides were dipped in 0.5% gelatin at 42°C and dried under vacuum. The dried slides were dipped in 50% photographic emulsion (Kodak, NTB2) at 42°C and exposed for 4 days at 4°C. The slides were then moved to room temperature for 1 h and developed (Kodak D-19) for 3 min at 15°C, fixed (Kodak) for 3 min at 15°C, washed in water, and air dried. Cells were stained using the Diff-Quik stain set (Baxter) and air dried. Slides were dipped into xylene and mounted (Electron Microscopy Science, DPX). Positive cells were identified using dark field microscopy. Positive pools were divided into 24 subpools each containing 200 independent clones; this selection process was continued until a single clone was isolated. The first of such clones was referred to as Y217.24.13.6B (6B). Plasmid DNA was sequenced by Lark Technologies Inc. (Houston, TX) and the Biotechnology Resource Laboratory of Yale University. Peptide sequence was deduced from the long open reading frame of the nucleotide sequence. DNA and peptide sequences were analyzed using the GCG program (Genetics Computer Group). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify a 375-bp segment within the putative coding region of the rat 6B cDNA clone. The amplification product was gel-purified, labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP using random primers (Boehringer Mannheim), and used as a probe to screen 1 × 106 plaque-forming unit of an adult human genomic library (Stratagene). Filter hybridization was carried out in the hybridization buffer (6 × SSC (0.9 M NaCl, 0.09 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.02% SDS, 3% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim), 30% formamide) at 37°C overnight. The filters were washed at 37°C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and positive clones were identified using the CSPD detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Two positive clones (HG11A and HG19) were isolated from the library and subjected to restriction enzyme digestion followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Southern blot hybridization analysis revealed two EcoRV restriction fragments that hybridized to the rat 6B probe. Once the coding region of the human Y5 homologue was identified by sequence analysis of these cloned fragments, the human NPY Y5 homologue was obtained by PCR amplification using HG11A DNA as template and subcloned into pcDNA3 expression vector for protein expression and pharmacological analysis. RNA blots were either purchased (Clontech) or prepared by fractionating 10 μg of poly(A) RNA from different rat brain regions or tissues using denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to Nytran membranes (Scheicher & Schuell). Hybridization with 32P-labeled rat 6B probe was carried out in 1 × hybridization solution (6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution (0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), 100 μg/ml sheared and denatured salmon sperm DNA) at 65°C. Filters were then washed at 65°C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and exposed to Kodak XAR 5 film. COS-7 cells were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and antibiotic/antimycotic. Cells at 70% confluency were transfected with DNA from various NPY Y5 clones using the Lipofectamine method (Life Technologies, Inc.). 15 μg of DNA and 90 μl of lipofectamine were added to each flask; culture medium was completely replaced 24 h post-transfection, and membranes were harvested after an additional 24 h. Cells were washed twice with 20 ml of ice-cold PBS, scraped into 5 ml of Tris buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.7), and then transferred to a centrifuge tube. The cells were homogenized for 2 × 10 s (Polytron 12 mm probe, 7000-8000 rpm) and centrifuged at 4°C for 5 min (IEC-Centra 7R) at 800 rpm. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, and the resulting pellet was removed and stored at −80°C. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad kit, with bovine IgG as the standard. Binding assays were performed on GF/C Millipore 96-well plates pretreated with 0.02% polyethylenimine for at least 2 h prior to use. The polyethylenimine was aspirated from the plates on a vacuum manifold immediately before the samples were added to the wells. All peptides, tissue, and radioligand were diluted with binding buffer (25 mM Tris, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mg/ml bacitracin, pH 7.4). For competition assays, increasing concentrations of peptide were incubated with [125I]PYY and tissue. In a final volume of 200 μl, samples consisted of 2.5-20 μg of membrane protein, 75 pM [125I]PYY (DuPont NEN), peptide dilution, or binding buffer. Nonspecific binding was defined by 1 μM PYY. NPY, PYY, (2-36)NPY, and (D-TRP32)NPY were synthesized at Bayer Corporation (West Haven, CT). All other peptides were purchased from either Peninsula or Bachem. For saturation experiments, increasing concentrations of [125I]PYY were incubated with membrane and 1 μM PYY. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature with constant mixing, the samples were aspirated on a vacuum manifold. The wells were washed with 3 × 200-μl aliquots of ice-cold binding buffer. The amount of radioactivity in the samples was then quantitated on a gamma counter. Binding data were analyzed using the nonlinear regression curve-fitting program RS/1 (BBN Software Products Corp.). An expression cloning strategy was used to clone a novel NPY receptor from rat hypothalamus. Of the DNA from 1300 pools assayed by expression cloning, 21 pools contained positive clones. Because the hypothalamus expresses different NPY receptor subtypes, the positive pools were tested for the presence of Y1, Y2, and Y4/PP1 receptor DNA by Southern blot analysis and PCR. Of the 21 positive pools, 12 contained Y1, and four contained Y2, whereas none contained Y4/PP1. None of the remaining five pools, Y217, Y555, Y589, Y861, and Y1139, contained these receptor cDNAs. Using 32P-labeled clone 6B (purified from pool Y217) as probe, it was revealed that pools Y555, Y589, Y861, and Y1139 contained closely related clones. Sequence analysis revealed that the 6B clone has a 2.4-kilobase pair cDNA insert with an open reading frame from nucleotides 242 to 1576 that encodes a 445-amino acid protein (Fig. 1). Hydrophobicity plot analysis indicates that the putative 6B protein has seven transmembrane-like domains, indicating that it may be a G-protein-coupled receptor. We have designated this novel NPY receptor subtype as the NPY Y5 receptor. Unlike other known subtypes of the NPY receptor family, the third intracellular (i3) loop of the Y5 receptor is unusually long, being comprised of about 140 amino acids. This long i3 domain is, however, not unique to the NPY class of neuropeptide-binding G-protein-coupled receptors; for example, the CCKA and CCKB receptors have i3 domains of 80-90 amino acids (21Wank S.A. Harkins R. Jensen R.T. Shapira H. de Weerth A. Slattery T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3125-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 22Pisegna J.R. de Weerth A. Huppi K. Wank S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The i3 domain is known to be involved in G-protein coupling (23Bockaert J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1991; 1: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Another novel feature of the Y5 peptide sequence is that it has a much shorter C-terminal tail sequence than other known members of the NPY receptor family. It has been shown that cloned NPY Y1, Y2, and Y4/PP1 receptors are capable of activating Gi or Go proteins, resulting in the inhibition of cAMP production and the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (4Gerald C.

The distribution and expression level of the rat Y5 receptor in rat brain and other tissues was determined by Northern blot analysis using the rat Y5 cDNA coding region as probe. A single 2.6-kilobase band was detected in the brain after overnight exposure of the blot (Fig. 2). No expression was seen in heart, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, or testis even after extended exposures. To further analyze the distribution of the rat Y5 receptor, expression of the transcript was examined in rat whole brain, cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, spleen, stomach, kidney, small intestine, adrenal, and pancreas. Y5 receptor mRNA was detectable in all the brain regions after a 1-day exposure, but no signal was observed for the other tissues even after a 1-week exposure (data not shown). The high level of expression of Y5 receptor in the brain and hypothalamus suggests that it plays an important role in the central nervous system. Importantly, intracerebroventricular injections of NPY have shown that the paraventricular nucleus and perifornical hypothalamus are the most sensitive brain regions for the induction of food intake (24Stanley B.G. The Biology of Neuropeptide Y and Related Peptides. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1993: 457Crossref Google Scholar, 25Stanley B.G. Leibowitz S.F. Life Sci. 1984; 35: 2635-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 26Stanley B.G. Daniel D.R. Chin A.S. Leibowitz S.F. Peptides. 1985; 6: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis has shown that the NPY Y5 receptor clone from pool Y555 has a 123-bp insertion relative to the 6B clone located in the 5′-untranslated region between nucleotides 232 and 233 (Fig. 1). This suggests that there may be separate exon(s) and, potentially, alternative splicing in this portion of the NPY Y5 gene. The present Northern blot analyses do not resolve this question. Whether differential splicing will ultimately demonstrate the existence of alternate promoters or start sites of translation remains to be seen. The sequences of Y5 clones purified from pools Y555, Y589, and Y861 are identical to that of the 6B clone with the exception of a C to T transition at nucleotide position 423 (Fig. 1). This causes the amino acid at residue 61, which is located near the intracellular face of the first transmembrane domain, to be a leucine rather than a proline. To test whether these different isoforms of the NPY Y5 receptor could be allelic variants of the same gene, genomic DNA from 16 rats was analyzed. A 314-bp DNA fragment that contains the site of the nucleotide variation was amplified by PCR and sequenced. Of the 16 DNA samples tested, 14 samples had a thymine residue at position 423, whereas two samples contained a cytosine (data not shown). This suggests that the polymorphism at this residue results from allelic variation. The human NPY Y5 receptor amino acid sequence is 88% identical to that of the rat Y5 receptor clone 6B and 30-33% identical to other NPY receptor subtypes (Fig. 3). Specifically, comparison of the rat Y5 amino acid sequence with rat Y1, Y2, and Y4/PP1 yields only 33, 31, and 32% identity, respectively. Searching the sequence data bases revealed that the human Y5 receptor sequence is nearly identical but in opposite orientation to that of the human NPY Y1 receptor, overlapping the NPY Y1 exon 1C promoter, exon 1C, and a portion of the associated intronic sequences (27Ball H.J. Shine J. Herzog H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27272-27276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The possible significance, regulatory or otherwise, of this finding is unclear at present and remains to be investigated. In addition, sequence analysis revealed insertions of a thymine residue at position 1226 and a TG nucleotide pair at positions 1235 and 1236 in the human Y5 coding region relative to the human Y1 sequence (data not shown). The binding of [125I]PYY to human and rat (clone Y861) NPY Y5 receptors transiently expressed in COS-7 cell membranes was reversible, saturable, and linear up to 75 and 25 μg of protein, respectively (data not shown). Specific binding typically ranged from 70-75% (human) or 70-80% (rat Y861 clone). Computer analysis of the saturation isotherms yielded a one-component model with a Kd value (n = 2) of 0.7 nM (human) or 0.9 nM (rat Y861) with a receptor density (Bmax) of 160 or 2100 fmol/mg protein, respectively (data not shown). In addition, the other less common isoform of the rat NPY Y5 (6B clone) had a Kd value of 0.4 nM and a Bmax of 140 fmol/mg protein (data not shown). The rank order of binding affinities for the rat Y861 clone is similar to the human NPY Y5 binding profile, as shown in Table I, such that NPY ≥ PYY = (LP)NPY = (LP)PYY = (2-36)NPY ≥ (3-36)NPY = (D-TRP32)NPY = hPP > (13-36)NPY = (13-36)PYY > rPP, (18-36)NPY, (22-36)NPY. The less common rat isoform, as represented by the 6B clone, is also included for comparison.

For example, NPY and PYY, which both have high affinity for Y5, Y1, and Y2 but not Y4/PP1 receptors, are strong stimulators of feeding (11Kalra S.P. Dube M.G. Fournier A. Kalra P.S. Physiol.

Although PP has lower affinity for NPY Y5 as compared with Y4/PP1, it is interesting to note that the NPY Y5 receptor distinguishes between rat and human PP with at least a 40-fold preference for human PP. In addition, (D-TRP32)NPY, a purported antagonist of NPY-induced feeding (28Balasubramaniam A. Sheriff S. Johnson M.E. Prabhakaran M. Huang Y. Fischer J.E. Chance W.T. J. Med.

The NPY Y5 receptor has a unique in vitro pharmacological profile that correlates with the in vivo feeding response generated by these peptides in rats. In addition, its distribution in brain, particularly the hypothalamus, further supports the possibility that the NPY Y5 receptor is associated with feeding and may be a useful target for identifying small molecule nonpeptide antagonists as appetite suppressants for the treatment of obesity. Addendum After this manuscript had been submitted for review, the rat neuropeptide Y5 receptor amino acid sequence was also published by Gerard et al. (31Gerald C. Walker M.W. Criscione L.

MARCKS is bound to the plasma membrane, and several recent studies suggest that this binding requires both hydrophobic insertion of its myristate chain into the bilayer and electrostatic interaction of its cluster of basic residues with acidic lipids. Phosphorylation of MARCKS by PKC introduces negative charges into the basic cluster, reducing its electrostatic interaction with acidic lipids and producing translocation of MARCKS from membrane to cytoplasm. The present study shows that physiological concentrations of MARCKS (<10 μM) inhibit phospholipase C (PLC)-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in phospholipid vesicles. A peptide corresponding to the basic cluster, MARCKS(151-175), produces a similar inhibition, which was observed with both PLC-δ1 and -β1. Direct fluorescence microscopy observations demonstrate that the MARCKS peptide forms lateral domains enriched in the acidic lipids phosphatidylserine and PIP2 but not PLC, which accounts for the observed inhibition of PIP2 hydrolysis. Phosphorylation of MARCKS(151-175) by PKC releases the inhibition and allows PLC to produce a burst of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol.

We have further characterized this interaction using a solid phase binding assay in which purified NG2 was shown to bind to pepsin-solubilized type VI collagen. In addition, NG2 bound a recombinant α2 (VI) collagen chain but did not appreciably bind to the recombinant α1 (VI) chain or the N-terminal domain of α3 (VI) (N9-N2). Binding of NG2 to type VI collagen was shown to be concentration-dependent and saturable and to depend mainly on the NG2 core protein, since chondroitinase-treated NG2 bound the collagen as well as undigested samples. In addition, the binding studies revealed several other possible ligands for NG2, including type II collagen, type V collagen, tenascin, and laminin. Binding of the proteoglycan to these molecules was also shown to be mediated by domains contained within the NG2 core protein. The ability of NG2 to bind to these extracellular matrix molecules was compared with that of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan decorin, revealing an almost identical binding pattern of the two proteoglycans to the different collagen types. In addition, decorin was found to effectively inhibit the ability of NG2 to bind to collagen, thus suggesting that the two proteoglycans may bind to some of the same regions on the collagen substrates. In contrast, decorin did not bind tenascin and was ineffective in inhibiting the binding of NG2 to tenascin or laminin, indicating that NG2 may bind these two molecules using a separate domain that is distinct from its collagen binding region.

Since p55 is thought to play the primary role in inflammatory processes, we postulated that the absence of p55 in mice would protect against atherosclerosis. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice lacking p55 had aortic sinus lesion sizes 2.3-fold larger than C57BL/6 wild type mice when fed an atherogenic diet (37,123 ± 3485 μm2 versus 16, 688 ± 2887 μm2, respectively, p < 0.0004). Plasma lipid levels were not different between strains. A 3-fold increase in the uptake and degradation of acetylated low density lipoprotein for p55-null as compared with wild type mice was demonstrated in cultured peritoneal macrophages. Immunohistochemical staining for scavenger receptor protein in the aortic sinus was more intense in lesions from the p55-null mice as compared with wild type controls.

A. 1991; 88: 9292-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), suggests that the p55 receptor regulates host defense mechanisms and is a primary mediator of inflammatory processes. In contrast, the role of p75 as a signaling receptor for TNF is less well established. This receptor is associated with TNF-mediated T-cell death and induction of necrotizing skin lesions (18Erickson S.L. de Sauvage F.J. Kikly K. Carver-Moore K. Pitts-Meek S. Gillett N. Sheehan K.C.

Despite the wealth of information concerning TNF and its inflammatory activities, the involvement of this cytokine in atherosclerotic lesion development is incompletely understood. To address the role of TNF receptor p55 activity in lesion development, atherosclerosis and lipid levels were quantified in mice genetically engineered to lack the p55 receptor. p55-null mice had lesion sizes 2.3-fold larger than wild type mice, yet plasma lipid levels were nearly identical between strains. The increase in lesion size in p55-null mice was accompanied by a 3-fold elevation in scavenger receptor activity as assessed in cultured peritoneal macrophages. Direct evaluation of scavenger receptor protein in aortic sinus sections from the mice suggests that this receptor is overexpressed in lesions from mice lacking the p55 receptor. Our results support the concept that TNF modulates scavenger receptor activity, and the loss of this modulation in p55-null mice contributes to accelerated fatty streak formation. We conclude that p55 contributes to protection against fatty streak lesion formation in atherosclerosis diet-fed mice. Receptor p55-null mice were generated by homologous recombination in a C57BL/6CR-derived embryonic stem cell line (20Zheng L. Fisher G. Miller R.E. Peschon J. Lynch D.H. Lenardo M.J.

Sections were evaluated for fatty streak lesions following lipid staining with Oil Red O and nuclei staining with hematoxylin. Lesion areas and numbers of nuclei per section were quantified using a Compaq 286 computer (Compaq Computer, Houston, TX) equipped with an FG-100 image acquisition board, a high resolution video camera, and Sony video monitor. Area measurements were evaluated using the Optimas Image Analysis Software Package (BioScan Inc., Edmonds, WA). For macrophage staining, slides were incubated overnight with an anti-Mac-1 antibody (No. 01711D, Pharmingen Inc., San Diego, CA; diluted 1:5) followed by a 2-h incubation with biotinylated anti-rat antibody (Catalog number BA 4001, Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, diluted 1:200). Staining for iNOS was performed by incubating sections overnight with a polyclonal anti-iNOS antibody (No. N32030/L6, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY; diluted 1:100) followed by a 2-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (No. 4010-05, Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc.; diluted 1:200). Smooth muscle cells were examined using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse monoclonal raised to human smooth muscle cell actin (No. U7033, Dako, Inc., Carpinteria, CA; diluted 1:6). Staining for scavenger receptor was performed using anti-scavenger receptor antibodies (clone 2F8, which recognizes both type I and type II murine scavenger receptors (30Hughes D.A. Fraser I.P. Gordon S. Immunol. Lett. 1994; 43: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Siamon Gordon, Oxford, UK) followed by incubation with a biotinylated secondary antibody. Binding was detected by incubating sections with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:200) followed by using the aminoethylcarbazole chromogen detection system (Dako, Inc.). All slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Prior to immunostaining, cells were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity and blocked with 5% nonfat milk. No reactivity in the aortic sinus was observed when either the primary or secondary antibodies were eliminated. Control and receptor-deficient mice maintained on chow diet were killed by cervical dislocation, and the peritoneal cavities of each mouse were flushed with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline to collect macrophages. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin and supplemented with 2.0 mM glutamine. Cells were plated at approximately 5 × 104 cells per well and incubated for 48 h prior to treatment with 125I-Ac-LDL as described by Bonet et al. (31Bonet B. Chait A. Gown A.M. Knopp R.H. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 112: 125-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Data are reported as mean ± S.E. The Student's t test was used to compare independent means in most cases. Lesion area comparisons were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney test. p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. To determine if TNF receptor p55 modulates the development of atherosclerosis in mice, p55-null mice were generated in the atherosclerosis-susceptible C57BL/6 strain. Using this strain, we can directly evaluate whether the p55-null allele increases or decreases atherosclerotic lesion formation. Female C57BL/6 and p55-null mice were fed rodent chow or the high fat/high cholesterol (atherogenic diet) for 14 weeks, and proximal aortic sinus lesion development was evaluated. Lesion size in the p55-null mice was 2.3-fold larger than that of C57BL/6 wild type mice (mean area of lesions ± S.E. was 16, 688 ± 2,887 in the wild type and 37,123 ± 3,485 for p55-null animals; p < 0.0004) (Fig. 1). Neither strain developed aortic atherosclerotic lesions when maintained on the chow diet for up to 8 months. Despite the difference in lesion size, the cellular composition of the lesions appeared similar between wild type and p55-deficient mice. In both strains, lesions were observed both along the aortic wall and at the valve cusps. Similar to wild type, the p55-null lesions were characterized by a lipid-enriched core with regions of reduced nuclear staining (Fig. 2, A and B). Immunocytochemical analysis showed that lesions consisted primarily of macrophages (Fig. 2C) with minimal or no smooth muscle cell involvement (data not shown). Macrophages were also the primary cell type seen in cellular caps covering lesioned areas. The ratio of cell nuclei number to lesion area was quantified among lesions from both strains. This ratio was 30% smaller for p55-null mice as compared with wild type mice (p < 0.003). In fact, comparing lesions of similar size between genotypes showed that p55-null mouse lesions contained less cells which suggests that either cells were more lipid enriched or lesions contained a greater proportion of extracellular lipid than in wild type animals. As a marker of activated macrophages, we examined lesioned sections for the presence of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS). This enzyme produces nitric oxide (NO) which is involved with both bacterial killing (32MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Chen H. Mudgett J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar) and maintenance of vasodilation (33Ignarro L.J. Buga G.M. Wood K.S. Byrns R.E. Chaudhuri G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 9265-9269Crossref PubMed Scopus (4242) Google Scholar). The expression of iNOS can be mediated by a variety of cytokines including TNF (34Denis G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 682-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 35Rosenkranz-Weiss P. Sessa W.C. Milstien S. Kaufman S. Watson C.A. Pober J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2236-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Macrophages examined within lesioned areas of both wild type and p55-null mice (Fig. 2D) expressed iNOS and, thus, were likely to be biologically active and responsive to their environment. iNOS was not detected in nonlesioned areas. The similarity in lesion structure between wild type and p55-null mice suggests that mechanisms for lesion development may be similar in each strain but that this process is accelerated in the p55-null mice. Possible mechanisms for accelerated fatty streak formation in p55-null mice include elevations in plasma cholesterol levels above those seen for wild type mice, alterations in the chemical composition of lipoproteins, or alterations at the artery wall directly affecting macrophage function. To address the first two mechanisms, we examined plasma lipid concentrations and plasma lipoprotein and apolipoprotein levels in wild type and p55-null mice fed the rodent chow and atherogenic diets (Table I).Table IPlasma lipid and apolipoprotein (apo) concentrations in wild type (+/+) and p55-null (−/−) miceLipid or apoproteinChow dietAtherogenic diet+/+−/−+/+−/−Total Cholesterol (TC)77 ± 4 (5Cotran R.S.

However, no significant differences were observed between strains fed this diet. Additionally, the ratio of HDL to total cholesterol, a measure of atherogenic risk, was similar for both strains. Using nonequilibrium density gradient ultracentrifugation by a single vertical spin to separate plasma lipoproteins from mice fed the atherogenic diet, we observed no differences in lipoprotein profiles between strains (data not shown). Finally, whereas plasma triglyceride levels were significantly reduced for both strains upon feeding the atherogenic diet, no differences were observed between strains in this parameter. Quantification of the major apolipoproteins showed that, although the atherogenic diet induced significant changes in several components, no major differences existed between strains (Table I). To verify that plasma lipoprotein compositions were not dramatically altered between strains fed the atherogenic diet, we sequentially isolated VLDL, LDL, and HDL and determined the cholesterol and apoprotein concentrations in these fractions (data not shown). We observed no major differences between strains in these parameters. Approximately 97-99% of apoB was isolated in the VLDL/LDL fractions, whereas the majority of apoE, apoA-I, and apoA-II were isolated in the HDL fraction. 40% of the total cholesterol was isolated in the VLDL fraction, 40% in the LDL fraction, and 20% in the HDL fraction, and no significant differences were observed between strains. These observations demonstrate that loss of p55 did not alter the lipoprotein concentration or composition in mice fed the atherogenic diet. We postulated that genetic differences in atherosclerosis susceptibility between wild type and p55-null mice are mediated at the level of the artery wall. Since the accumulation of lipid by macrophages is a characteristic feature of these lesions, one potential site by which genetic factors could mediate fatty streak formation is by the increased uptake of atherogenic lipoproteins via scavenger receptors. It is thought that such receptors are responsible for macrophage foam cell formation via the uptake of modified lipoproteins (36Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar) and are an attractive candidate for study because TNF is reported to down-regulate such activity in cultured macrophages (37Van Lenten B.J. Fogelman A.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 112-116PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse peritoneal macrophages taken from chow diet-fed wild type and p55-null mice were incubated at 37°C with increasing concentrations of 125I-acetyl-LDL (Ac-LDL), a ligand for the scavenger receptor, and degradation of radiolabeled protein was measured (31Bonet B. Chait A. Gown A.M. Knopp R.H. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 112: 125-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, degradation of Ac-LDL was saturable for both wild type and p55-null mice, with half-maximal values of 12 μg/ml for both mouse strains. Scatchard analysis was consistent with a 3-fold increase in the number of scavenger receptors accounting for the increased degradation seen in p55-null mice. Although these experiments were performed using peritoneal macrophages, the results support the concept that increased fatty streak formation in p55-null mice may be due, at least in part, to an increase in the number of scavenger receptors available for lipoprotein uptake in the artery wall. To determine whether altered scavenger receptor expression was altered in vivo, lesions from control and receptor-deficient mice were immunostained using the 2F8 monoclonal antibody (30Hughes D.A. Fraser I.P. Gordon S. Immunol. Lett. 1994; 43: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) which recognizes both types I and II murine scavenger receptors (Fig. 4). Quantitative differences in staining intensity was determined using several dilutions of the antibody. Increased scavenger receptor protein expression at lesioned sites was observed in the p55-null mice as compared with wild type controls. Staining in nonlesioned sites was not seen in either strain suggesting that scavenger receptor expression is associated with the atherogenic process. No staining was observed when either the primary or secondary antibody was eliminated from the staining process (data not shown). These results are consistent with the increased scavenger receptor activity observed using cultured peritoneal macrophages and suggests that loss of p55 increases scavenger receptor protein expression within developing atherosclerotic lesions. In this report, we tested the role of the TNF receptor p55 in atherosclerosis development in the mouse. These studies constitute the first report of atherosclerosis in mice with genetically engineered changes in cytokine receptor gene expression. At the artery wall, this receptor is thought to mediate the action of TNF in inflammatory processes, such as the activation of endothelial adhesion molecules and monocyte chemotaxis and differentiation. This receptor may also mediate processes directed by a second ligand produced by activated T-cells, lymphotoxin. Thus, we hypothesized that atherosclerosis development would be reduced in mice lacking receptor function. In contrast to this, proximal aortic fatty streak lesions were 2.3-fold larger in p55-null mice compared to wild type mice, suggesting that the TNF receptor p55 plays an important role in protection against atherosclerosis. The protective effect of p55 may occur through multiple mechanisms because of the functional pleiotropism of TNF and its receptor molecules (19Tartaglia L.A. Weber R.F. Figari I.S. Reynolds C. Polladino Jr M.A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9292-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Many responses associated with the production of TNF are considered to promote atherosclerosis including the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules (4Pober J. Cotran R.S. Lab. Invest. 1991; 64: 301-305PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cotran R.S. Pober J.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1990; 1: 225-235PubMed Google Scholar) and increased endothelial cell permeability (3Stolpen A.H. Guinan E.C. Fiers W. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 123: 16-24PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, by eliminating p55, these processes should be reduced and atherosclerosis diminished. Since we observed the opposite result, it was useful to focus on evaluating potential mechanisms associated with a role for TNF in protection against lesion formation. One such mechanism would be modulation of lipoprotein metabolism by p55. Precedence exists for such action, as specific enzymes mediating lipoprotein metabolism have also been shown to be modulated by TNF (9Kawakami M. Pekala P.H. Lane M.D. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 40Ettinger W.H. Varma V.K. Sorci-Thomas M. Parks J.S. Sigmon R.C. Smith T.K. Verdery R.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition, acute TNF exposure by injection or exposure to endotoxin results in increased plasma VLDL concentrations (10Feingold K.R. Serio M.K. Adi S. Moser A.H. Grunfeld C. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 2336-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, we observed no differences in plasma lipid, lipoprotein, or apolipoprotein levels between strains fed the atherogenic diet. Thus, differences in atherosclerosis severity between strains is clearly attributable to chronic functions of the p55 receptor which do not affect plasma lipoprotein concentrations or compositions. Feeding of this particular atherogenic diet has been linked to the induction of inflammatory genes and the regulatory factor, NF-κB (41Liao F. Andalibi A. deBeer F.C. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although the expression of TNF and its receptors were not studied directly, it is possible that TNF expression was also induced by the atherogenic diet, since NF-κB participates in the regulation of TNF gene expression (41Liao F. Andalibi A. deBeer F.C. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 42Albrecht H. Schook L.B. Jongeneel C.V. J. Inflamm. 1995; 45: 64-71PubMed Google Scholar). However, the hypertriglyceridemia normally associated with systemic TNF release was not observed in our mice suggesting that either TNF expression is not provoked by the diet, or that TNF is induced and utilized within specific tissues. This is currently under study, as are the effects of particular dietary ingredients on the expression of TNF and its receptors. Regardless of any changes in expression of TNF due to feeding the atherogenic diet, it is clear that the activity of p55 cannot entirely protect against the combination of events leading to atherosclerosis in C57BL/6 mice, since the wild type animals did develop fatty streak lesions. Since TNF affects the activities of endothelial cells, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells (3Stolpen A.H. Guinan E.C. Fiers W. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 123: 16-24PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cotran R.S. Pober J.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1990; 1: 225-235PubMed Google Scholar, 12Shibano T. Vanhoutte P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H403-H407PubMed Google Scholar, 37Van Lenten B.J. Fogelman A.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 112-116PubMed Google Scholar, 38Tipping P.G. Hancock W.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1721-1728PubMed Google Scholar), loss of the p55 receptor could lead to changes in the cellularity or overall character of lesions. We found that lesions in p55-null mice were similar in overall character to those seen in cholesterol-fed wild type mice. Both strains showed fatty streak lesions in the proximal aortic sinus. The main cell type was macrophages, consistent with other reports of C57BL/6 lesions (28Paigen B. Morrow A. Holmes P.A. Mitchell D. Williams R.A. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 68: 231-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 39Mehrabian M. Demer L.L. Lusis A.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The macrophages in both strains were activated as evidenced by strong immunocytochemical staining for iNOS. Smooth muscle cells were absent from all lesions examined. Despite these similarities, the lesions of p55-null mice contained less cell nuclei per lesion area as compared with wild type mice. This result suggests that differences exist between strains with respect to the proliferation, migration, and/or death of macrophages. Since many responses associated with the production of TNF are considered to promote artery wall macrophage accumulation (3Stolpen A.H. Guinan E.C. Fiers W. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 123: 16-24PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pober J. Cotran R.S. Lab. Invest. 1991; 64: 301-305PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cotran R.S. Pober J.S. J. Am. Soc.

Chem. 1992; 267: 9467-9469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), eliminating p55 may have led to the reduced cell numbers. Overall lesion sizes were the same or larger for p55-null mice as compared with wild type mice suggesting that p55-null lesions accumulated a greater amount of cellular and/or extracellular lipid. A probable mechanism by which p55 exerts limited protective function is by controlling scavenger receptor activity. Scavenger receptors are expressed by activated macrophages and are responsible for the uptake of modified lipoproteins. These pathways are thought to result in macrophage lipid accumulation and subsequent transformation of macrophages into foam cells at the artery wall (36Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Using peritoneal macrophages to model events at the artery wall, we found that p55-null mice expressed 3-fold higher scavenger receptor activity than wild type mice based on the uptake and degradation of Ac-LDL. Consistent with this result, immunohistochemical studies showed increased type I and/or type II scavenger receptor protein expression in aortic sinus lesions of p55-null mice as compared with wild type mice. Recent studies by Hsu et al. (43Hsu H.-Y. Nicholson A.C. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7767-7773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) showed TNF to down-regulate scavenger receptor gene expression and protein in macrophage cell line THP-1 via transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. Down-regulation occurred even upon stimulation of scavenger receptor activity with M-CSF. Since elevations in M-CSF have been seen in C57BL/6 mice fed the atherogenic diet (41Liao F. Andalibi A. deBeer F.C. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that M-CSF may be responsible for induction of scavenger receptors which are not down-regulated in the mice lacking TNF receptor p55. In summary, these studies demonstrate a unique and significant role for TNF receptor p55 in the atherogenic process. Our data suggest that a function of the p55 receptor is to protect against atherosclerotic lesion development in mice fed the atherogenic diet. This protection may be accomplished, in part, by down-regulation of scavenger receptor activity resulting in decreased macrophage lipid accumulation. Furthermore, these observations support the hypothesis that increased lipid uptake via the scavenger receptor contributes to lipid accumulation and subsequent fatty streak formation at the vessel wall. Future studies are aimed at determining the mechanism of p55 regulation of scavenger receptor expression as well as the role of TNF receptor p75 in the atherogenic process. By comparing the results we obtained from these studies with results observed in mice deficient in either TNF or lymphotoxin, the role of each cytokine via its receptors in lesion development can be delineated.

Within limits, these amino acids may be varied, without loss of function. The specificity of this peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) is remarkable considering its small size and its relaxed consensus sequence. Moreover, several peroxisomal proteins have a PTS1-like signal that does not fit the reported consensus sequence. Because many of these PTS1 variants seem to be functional in a species-dependent or protein context-dependent manner, we investigated the PTS1 requirements in a homologous context, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and endogenous peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase (MDH3). Peroxisomal import of the MDH3-PTS1 variants was tested qualitatively by the ability to complement the Δmdh3 mutant and quantitatively by subcellular fractionation. We observed efficient import of MDH3 into peroxisomes with a large variety of PTS1 tripeptides. Many of these variants do not fit the observed PTS1 requirements for heterologously expressed proteins, which suggests that additional domains in the protein may be of decisive importance whether or not a certain PTS1 variant is recognized by the components of the peroxisomal import machinery. Because we show that dimerization of MDH3 precedes import into the organelle, these domains are most likely conformational domains.

Because many of these PTS1 variants seem to be functional in a species-dependent or protein context-dependent manner, we investigated the PTS1 requirements in a homologous context, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and endogenous peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase (MDH3). Peroxisomal import of the MDH3-PTS1 variants was tested qualitatively by the ability to complement the Δmdh3 mutant and quantitatively by subcellular fractionation. We observed efficient import of MDH3 into peroxisomes with a large variety of PTS1 tripeptides. Many of these variants do not fit the observed PTS1 requirements for heterologously expressed proteins, which suggests that additional domains in the protein may be of decisive importance whether or not a certain PTS1 variant is recognized by the components of the peroxisomal import machinery. Because we show that dimerization of MDH3 precedes import into the organelle, these domains are most likely conformational domains. Peroxisomes are nearly ubiquitous organelles bounded by a single membrane. Their function differs from organism to organism but always includes the β-oxidation of fatty acids. Peroxisomal matrix proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and are targeted to peroxisomes by virtue of a peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS). 1The abbreviations used are: PTSperoxisomal targeting signalPCRpolymerase chain reactionCHAPS3[(cholamidopropyl)dimethyl-ammonio]-1 propanesulfonateMDHmalate dehydrogenase. Two types of peroxisomal targeting signals have been identified so far. The PTS1 is located at the extreme COOH terminus of a protein and was first identified in firefly luciferase, which is targeted to peroxisomes when expressed in mammalian cells (1Gould S.J. Keller G.-A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2923-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 2Keller G.A. Gould S.J. Deluca M. Subramani S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3264-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The PTS1 signal is present in the majority of the peroxisomal matrix proteins. The second peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS2) resides at the NH2 terminus of a protein and was first identified in thiolase (1Gould S.J. Keller G.-A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2923-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 2Keller G.A. Gould S.J. Deluca M. Subramani S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Only a limited number of peroxisomal matrix proteins are imported via this signal. peroxisomal targeting signal polymerase chain reaction 3[(cholamidopropyl)dimethyl-ammonio]-1 propanesulfonate malate dehydrogenase. The PTS1 is a remarkable targeting signal in two aspects. First, the PTS1 is very small, because it consists of only a tripeptide. Second, considering the length of the targeting signal, the PTS1 consensus sequence is relaxed. Mutational analysis of the tripeptide of luciferase resulted in the following consensus sequence: (S/A/C)(K/H/R)(L/M) (in one-letter amino acid notation) or more general: a small amino acid at the first position, a basic amino acid at the second position, and a leucine (or methionine, although this was less efficient) at the last position. These conclusions were based on an immunofluorescence import assay in transfected mammalian cells expressing the heterologous luciferase gene or hybrid genes of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fused to luciferase (5Gould S.J. Keller G.-A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 6Swinkels B.W. Gould S.J. Subramani S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). An even more relaxed consensus PTS1 was observed for import of proteins into glycosomes of trypanosomes (7Blattner J. Swinkels B. Dorsam H. Prospero T. Subramani S. Clayton C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Keller G.A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For these studies either luciferase was used or a hybrid protein of the COOH-terminal 6 amino acids of glycosomal phosphoglycerate kinase fused to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Import was determined using a selective permeabilization assay. Recent observations justified reinvestigation of the nature of the PTS1. First, PTS1-resembling sequences have now been identified in a large number of proteins (reviewed by 9De Hoop M.J. AB G. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 10Roggenkamp R. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1992; 10: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 11Subramani S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 445-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and this number is rapidly increasing by the cloning of genes encoding peroxisomal proteins. Although the consensus PTS1 originally seemed to be a simple one, more and more PTS1-like sequences are identified that do not match the originally defined consensus sequence. Because these PTS1 variants were mostly found in trypanosomes and yeasts, this has been explained by species divergence. However, the recent observation that a human protein (alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase) can also be targeted to peroxisomes of mammalian cells by PTS1 tripeptides (KKL, SSL, SQL, and NKL) that do not fit the consensus sequence makes the proposed species divergence questionable (12Motley A. Lumb M.J. Oatey P.B. Jennings P.R. De Zoysa P.A. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F. Danpure C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A second reason to re-examine the nature of PTS1-dependent import is the remarkable finding that peroxisomes are able to import folded proteins (13Glover J.R. Andrews D.W. Rachubinski R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10541-10545Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 14McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. J.

These findings may indicate that the folded structure of the protein is of decisive importance for recognition of the PTS1. All comprehensive mutation analyses of the PTS1 have been performed with either heterologously expressed peroxisomal proteins or with nonperoxisomal reporter proteins, without check on the functional competence of the imported protein (5Gould S.J. Keller G.-A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 6Swinkels B.W. Gould S.J. Subramani S.

Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore we decided to analyze the PTS1 signal in the homologous context and in a more quantitative and functional manner. To this purpose, we have made mutations in the PTS1 signal of the endogenous MDH3 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Import of the MDH3-PTS1 mutants was qualitatively scored by the (in)ability to complement the Δmdh3 mutant and was quantified by subcellular fractionation. We conclude that a wide variety of PTS1 signals are functional when presented in a homologous context and discuss the implications for the interaction between the PTS1-containing protein and the PTS1 receptor. Yeast strains used for this study were the S. cerevisiae strains BJ1991 (MAT a, leu2, trp1, ura3-251, prb1-1122, pep4-3) and Δmdh3 (MDH3::LEU2) and Δpex5 (Δpas10) (PEX5::LEU2), which were made in BJ1991 as described in 16Van Roermund C.W.T.

Yeast transformants were selected and grown on minimal medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 2% glucose, and amino acids (20 μg/ml) as needed. Liquid oleate medium used for induction contained 0.5% potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 0.3% yeast extract (Difco), 0.5% peptone, and 0.12% oleic acid/0.2% Tween 40 as carbon source. Before shifting to this medium, cells were grown on 0.3% glucose minimal medium for at least 24 h. Oleic acid plates contained 0.1% oleic acid/0.4% Tween 40, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.1% yeast extract, and amino acids (20 μg/ml) as needed. For immunoprecipitations, we used cells grown on minimal medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, amino acids (20 μg/ml) as needed and either 2% glycerol or 0.1% oleic acid/0.4% Tween 40. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and transferred to nitro-cellulose paper in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol). For qualitative analysis, the blots were blocked overnight by incubation in TBST (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) supplied with 2% nonfat dry milk. The same buffer was also used for incubation with the primary antibody and for IgG-coupled alkaline phosphatase. The blots were stained in AP buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2) with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium as per the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). For quantitative analysis, blots were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% gelatin, 0.5% Tween 20. For incubation with antibodies, we used phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% gelatin, 0.5% Tween 20. Blots were washed in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% gelatin, 0.5% Tween 20 and incubated with 125I-labeled protein A followed by quantitation using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The synthetic NH epitope tag CQDLPGNDNST (corresponding to the NH2 terminus of the mature hem-agglutinin protein) was conjugated with maleimide bis N-hydroxysuccinimide to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used for antibody production in rabbits. For epitope tagging, an oligonucleotide adaptor encoding the NH epitope was ligated in the SacI/BamHI site of the CTA1 expression plasmids. People interested in these epitope tagging reagents should contact P. van der Sluijs. The raising of thiolase antibodies is described in 19Elgersma Y. Kwast L. Klein A. Voorn-Brouwer T.

After digestion of the created BamHI and HindIII sites, the fragment was cloned into the BamHI/HindIII site of pUC19 (pUC-MDH3-SEL). MDH3-SKL was made by replacing the ClaI/HindIII fragment of pUC-MDH3-SEL by the ClaI/HindIII fragment of pUC-MDH3 (16Van Roermund C.W.T. Elgersma Y. Singh N. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3480-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) resulting in pUC-MDH3-SKL. The MDHΔKL gene was obtained by PCR on genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae, using the primers 5′-AAGGATCCATGGTCAAAGTCGCAATTCTTG-3′ and 5′-AAAAAGCTTCATAGCTAGGAAGAGTCTACGATGAAACTC-3′. This fragment was cut with ClaI/HindIII and cloned into the ClaI/HindIII site of pUC-MDH3-SEL resulting in pUC-MDH3ΔKL. All constructs were verified by sequencing starting from the 3′ end until the ClaI site to make sure that all genes were identical except for the PTS1. The genes were subsequently cloned in the BamHI/HindIII site behind the catalase promoter of pEL43 (20Elgersma Y. Van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. Distel B. Genetics. 1993; 135: 731-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is derived from pYCplac33 (21Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). The multicopy plasmid used was similar to pEL43 except that it was based on pYEplac 181 (21Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). To construct a library of MDH3-PTS1 mutants, an XbaI restriction site was created by introducing a silent mutation 19 base pairs upstream of the stopcodon of the MDH3 gene. This was achieved by PCR on pWT-MDH3 (pEL102) using a universal primer and the MDH3-Xba primer 5′-GAAGAGTCTAGAATGAAACTCTTGCG-3′. The obtained PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and XbaI and cloned behind the CTAI promoter of pEL43 (20Elgersma Y. Van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. Distel B. Genetics. 1993; 135: 731-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To exclude PCR mistakes, this construct was sequenced up to the ClaI site, and the remainder of the gene was replaced with the SacI-ClaI fragment of pNH-MDH3-SKL (pEL143), resulting in NH-MDH3ΔPTS1 (pEL149). This plasmid was cut with XbaI and PstI, purified, and recirculated by ligating in the presence of the degenerated oligonucleotide adaptors (Fig. 1). The ligation mixture was transformed to a Escherichia coli MutS strain. The obtained colonies were rinsed from the plates, and plasmid DNA was isolated. This DNA was retransformed to E. coli (DH5α), and DNA was isolated from single colonies. This was sequenced from the 3′ end up to approximately 20 base pairs after the XbaI site. Although we often found unexpected mutations at the place of the introduced oligos, we never found mutations before the XbaI site. We had to sequence about 70 clones to obtain the reported random mutations in the tripeptide. The FFF and ANL tripeptides were made by using nondegenerated adaptors. After sequencing, the selected plasmids were tranformed to the Δmdh3 mutant. Oleate-induced cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde. Ultra-thin sections were prepared as described in 22Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Schneider M. Howell S.H. Garrard L.J. Goodman J.M. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Subramani S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar. Subcellular fractionations and Nycodenz gradients were performed as described previously (23Elgersma Y. Van Roermund C.W.T. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3472-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Enzymes were measured as described earlier (24Van Roermund C.W.T. Van den Berg M. Wanders R.J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 20 ml of a culture of cells grown overnight on 0.3% glucose minimal medium was spun, and the cells were resuspended in 5 ml of minimal glycerol or oleate medium. After growing the cells for another 2 h, the cells were collected and resuspended in 1 ml of minimal glycerol medium or oleate medium with 25 μCi of 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine. After an incubation of 1.5 h (28°C, shaking), cells were transferred in 2-ml Eppendorf tubes, spun, and resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100). After adding glass beads, the cells were lysed by vortexing for 30 min at 4°C. The cell debris and glassbeads were removed by a short spin. Subsequently, 100 μl of a 10% protein A beads suspension (washed in HBS buffer (50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 200 mM NaCl) containing 0.5% CHAPS and 2.5 μl of NH-antibody were added to the cell-free lysate, and this was incubated for 1 h at 4°C while shaking. The beads were collected by a short spin, washed two times with immunoprecipitation buffer, and heated in Laemmli sample buffer. Beads were spun down, and the supernatants were then layered on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After staining and destaining, the gels were washed in 30% methanol/phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min and then incubated in enhancer (20 g/liter of sodium salicylate in 30% methanol), dried, and subjected to fluorography. The glycerol medium appeared to be especially useful for labeling experiments with cells that are unable to grow on oleate. For wild-type cells, the results were identical for the two media used. Peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase of S. cerevisiae (MDH3) possesses the typical PTS1 tripeptide SKL at its COOH terminus (25Steffan J.S. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24708-24715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because some PTS1-containing proteins contain additional (internal) peroxisomal targeting signals (23Elgersma Y.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we tested whether import of MDH3 completely relies on this tripeptide. To this purpose we made one PTS1 mutant from which the last two amino acids were deleted (MDH3ΔKL) and one PTS1 mutant in which the positively charged lysine residue was replaced by the negatively charged glutamic acid residue (MDH3-SEL). Previously, it has been shown that this substitution blocks peroxisomal import of luciferase in CV-1 cells and in S. cerevisiae (5Gould S.J. Keller G.-A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 20Elgersma Y. Van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. Distel B. Genetics. 1993; 135: 731-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Distel B. Gould S.J. Voorn-Brouwer T. Van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. New Biologist. 1992; 4: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type gene (MDH3-SKL) and the mutant genes were placed under the control of the peroxisomal catalase promoter (CTA1) and transformed to Δmdh3 cells. Recently, we demonstrated that Δmdh3 cells were unable to grow on plates containing oleate as sole carbon source (16Van Roermund C.W.T. Elgersma Y. Singh N. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3480-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Import of the MDH3-PTS1 variants was tested by the ability of the transformants to complement the growth defect of Δmdh3 cells. Δmdh3 cells transformed with MDH3-SKL regained their ability to grow on oleate plates. No growth was observed in Δmdh3 cells transformed with the MDH3ΔKL plasmid, indicating that the SKL tripeptide is required for import of MDH3 into peroxisomes and that no additional peroxisomal targeting signals are present in this protein (data not shown). Surprisingly, we found that Δmdh3 cells expressing MDH3-SEL fully regained the ability to grow on oleate. This indicates that sufficient amounts of MDH3-SEL were imported into peroxisomes to give functional complementation. To measure the efficiency of import, we determined the amount of MDH3 in peroxisomes. Wild-type cells and Δmdh3 transformants were induced on oleate, followed by subcellular fractionation. To eliminate the contributions of cytosolic and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH2 and MDH1, respectively), the organellar pellet was further fractionated on a Nycodenz density gradient. Import into peroxisomes was roughly estimated by determining the distribution of MDH activity between the peroxisomal and the mitochondrial peak fractions (P and M, Fig. 2). The MDH distribution in wild-type cells was similar to the distribution observed in Δmdh3 cells transformed with pMDH3-SKL, indicating that the output of the endogenous MDH3 promoter is very similar to the output of the CTA1 promoter under these conditions. No bimodal MDH distribution was observed in Δmdh3 cells transformed with pMDH3ΔKL, which is in line with the observation that this plasmid was not able to complement the Δmdh3 mutant. Approximately 30% of MDH3-SEL was imported into peroxisomes, based on the P:M ratio of MDH3-SEL (P:M = 0.6:1) compared with that of MDH3-SKL (P:M = 2:1). To determine the import of the MDH3-PTS1 variants in a more convenient and quantitative manner, we epitope-tagged the protein at its NH2 terminus with the NH tag. After subcellular fractionation of the transformants, the amount of NH-MDH3 in the organellar pellet fraction and cytosolic supernatant fraction was determined by Western blotting using the antibody against the NH epitope, followed by 125I-labeled protein A. The amount of 125I labeling was quantified with a PhosphorImager. At least 90% of NH-MDH3-SKL proved to be present in the organellar pellet (Fig. 3A). No import was observed for the NH-MDH3ΔKL protein (data not shown), whereas we found that on average 50% of the NH-MDH3-SEL protein was imported into peroxisomes (Fig. 3A). These results are in agreement with the rough estimates based on the gradient analysis, indicating that the NH tag did not interfere with targeting of MDH3. Import of NH-MDH3-SEL into peroxisomes could also be demonstrated with immunoelectronmicroscopy. As shown in Fig. 4B, NH-MDH3-SEL was present inside the organelle and not just associated with it. This is consistent with the observation that (NH-)MDH3-SEL complemented the growth defect of Δmdh3 cells. No import was observed in Δmdh3 cells expressing NH-MDH3ΔKL (not shown). The tagged protein also enabled us to study the import of MDH3 in the PTS1 import mutant, pex5 (formerly named pas10), and the PTS2-import mutant, pex7 (formerly named pas7) (17Van der Leij I.

Import of NH-MDH3-SKL was normal in pex7 cells but blocked in pex5 cells, indicating that import of this protein into peroxisomes is dependent on the presence of the PTS1 receptor (Fig. 3B). It was remarkable that MDH3-SEL was imported into peroxisomes, because it has previously been demonstrated that luciferase-SEL or bleomycin-luciferase-SEL cannot be imported into peroxisomes of S. cerevisiae (20Elgersma Y. Van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. Distel B. Genetics. 1993; 135: 731-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Distel B. Gould S.J. Voorn-Brouwer T. Van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. New Biologist. 1992; 4: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that some targeting signals are functional in endogenous peroxisomal proteins but not in the context of heterologously expressed proteins. To test this hypothesis, we constructed MDH3-PTS1 variants with substitutions at the first, second, and third position of the tripeptide. The resulting constructs were sequenced and transformed to Δmdh3 cells. Import was determined by the ability of the transformants to grow on oleate and by subcellular fractionation followed by Western blotting and quantitation using a PhosphorImager (Table I).Table ITargeting of MDH3-PTS1 variantsXKLImportSXLImportSKXImportXXXImportEKL++SAL+SKD−−ΔKL−−FKL++SEL+SKE−FFF−GKL++SFL++SKF++ANL+IKL++SHL++SKL++KKL++SKL++SKN−LKL++SRL++SKP−MKL++SSL+SKR−−NKL++SYL++SKS−PKL++SKT−SKL++SKV++TKL++ Open table in a new tab We could not find any amino acid substitution at the first position of the tripeptide that had an influence on the import efficiency. Many substitutions were also tolerated at the second position of the tripeptide. The most severe mutations obtained at this position were the negatively charged glutamic acid (E) and the small alanine (A) residue, but even the majority of these MDH3-PTS1 variants were imported. Furthermore, we found that positively charged amino acids (K/R/H) could be replaced by aromatic amino acids (Y/F) without any noticeable effect on the import efficiency. The number of functional mutations at the last position of the tripeptide was much more limited, as has also been observed in the luciferase import studies (5Gould S.J. Keller G.-A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). MDH3-PTS1 variants which were imported for only 5% (SKN and SKE), were still able to complement the Δmdh3 mutant. No complementation (and import) was observed when the ultimate amino acid was replaced by the charged residues arginine (R) or aspartic acid (D). Because these proteins were able to complement the growth defect of a Δmdh2 mutant on ethanol (data not shown), this seems not to be caused by inactivation of these proteins. A phenylalanine (F) is tolerated at every position without any noticeable effect on the import efficiency (Table I). It might be that this amino acid is functional at any position as long as the other two positions are still conserved according to the “optimal” sequence SKL. This “two out of three ain't bad” rule predicted that if we mutated the entire tripeptide to phenylalanine residues, the import efficiency would decrease. This was indeed the case, although the NH-MDH3-FFF protein was still imported to some extent and able to complement the Δmdh3 mutant. We also tested the tripeptide ANL, which is the putative (nonconsensus) targeting signal of human peroxisomal catalase. We observed rather efficient import of MDH3-ANL, suggesting that this tripeptide functions as a valid PTS1 signal. Recently, it has been shown by several elegant studies that proteins can be imported into peroxisomes in a folded (multimeric) state (13Glover J.R. Andrews D.W. Rachubinski R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For example, thiolase without a peroxisomal targeting signal (thiolaseΔPTS2) can be imported when expressed in wild-type cells but not when it is expressed in a thiolase disruption strain (13Glover J.R. Andrews D.W. Rachubinski R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10541-10545Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This strongly suggested that thiolaseΔPTS2 is imported as a dimer with wild-type thiolase (“piggy-back”) and hence that complete unfolding is probably not required for import into peroxisomes. A similar experiment was reported in 14McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1245-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar. Using the same experimental setup, we tested whether dimerization of MDH3 also precedes import. To that end we transformed the plasmid pNH-MDH3ΔPTS1 to wild-type cells. The NH-MDH3ΔPTS1 protein not only contains an epitope tag to distinguish it from wild-type MDH3 but is also 7 amino acids longer than wild-type MDH3, because the COOH-terminal 5 amino acids were replaced by a peptide of 12 amino acids (Fig. 1). Because this larger protein can easily be distinguished from the shorter wild-type protein, it enabled us to verify that no recombination events had occurred between the pNH-MDH3ΔPTS1 plasmid and the endogenous wild-type gene. Such an event could result in an NH-MDH3-SKL gene, which would hamper the analysis. The transformed cells were induced on oleate, and the amount of imported NH-MDH3ΔPTS1 was determined by subcellular fractionation followed by Western blotting using the NH antibody. Surprisingly, in contrast to the ea"

A competent AhR comprises at least two components following nuclear translocation and DNA binding, the AhR and the AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt) protein, whose combined action on human CYP1A1 gene transcription is shown to be dependent upon functional protein kinase C (PKC). In the present study, we examined the effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a potent PKC activator, on the ligand-induced transcriptional activation of the CYP1A1 gene and cellular function of the AhR in human HepG2 101L cells. The 101L cells carry a stable transgene consisting of 1800 bases of 5′-flanking DNA and the promoter of the human CYP1A1 gene linked to the firefly luciferase structural gene (Postlind, H., Vu, T.

Inhibition of PKC activity blocked directly the transcriptional activation and the transactivation of the CYP1A1 gene, indicating a role for PKC in the AhR-mediated transcriptional activation process. However, the DNA binding activities of the in vitro activated and the induced nuclear AhR as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis were not affected when CYP1A1 transcription was inhibited, indicating the actions of PKC to be a nuclear event that works in concert with or precedes AhR binding to the gene. These results illustrate that PKC is absolutely essential for the cellular and molecular events that control induction of CYP1A1 gene transcription.

https://openalex.org/W1988276497,"To determine whether mtDNA and mitochondrial respiratory function in pancreatic beta cells are necessary for the phenotypic expression of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, we used a cultured mouse pancreatic beta cell line, MIN6, and two derivative lines, mtDNA knockout MIN6 (ρ0 MIN6) and mtDNA repopulated cybrid MIN6. The MIN6 cells retain the property of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, but their mtDNA knockout induced the loss of mitochondrial transcription, translation, and respiration activity, without inhibition of transcription of the insulin gene or loss of succinate dehydrogenase activity, indicating that the observed mitochondrial dysfunction in ρ0 MIN6 cells was not due to a cytotoxic side effect derived from the mtDNA knockout. Moreover, the mtDNA depletion also inhibited both the glucose-stimulated increase in the intracellular free Ca2+ content and the elevation of insulin secretion. The possibility of the involvement of nuclear genome-encoded factors in this process was excluded by the observation that the missing sensitivity to extracellular glucose stimulation in ρ0 MIN6 cells was restored reversibly by repopulation with foreign mtDNA and isolating cybrid MIN6 clones. Therefore, these findings provide unambiguous evidence for the involvement of the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by mtDNA impairment in developing pathogeneses of some forms of diabetes mellitus.

Therefore, these findings provide unambiguous evidence for the involvement of the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by mtDNA impairment in developing pathogeneses of some forms of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is characterized as a genetically heterogeneous disorder but exhibits common features, such as glucose intolerance (1Martin B.C. Warram J.H. Krolewski A.S. Bergman R.N. Soeldner J.S. Kahn C.R. Lancet. 1992; 340: 925-929Abstract PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar) and a relative lack of insulin release (2O'Rahilly S.P. Rudenski A.S. Burnett M.A. Nugent Z.

It is generally considered that various genetic factors, as well as unknown ones, could be causes of diabetes mellitus. Several genes, such as the insulin gene (3Steiner D.F. Tager H.S. Chan S.J.

Acta. 1995; 1271: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), have been reported to be responsible for the subsets of the disease. They encode factors necessary for the metabolic processes from the insulin synthesis and secretion in pancreatic beta cells to the insulin action on various target cells. On insulin secretion in response to glucose and other nutrients, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and the production of ATP in pancreatic beta cells have been proposed to play significant roles (for review, see 9Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Insulin-Molecular Biology to Pathology. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1992: 97Google Scholar); the ATP production and subsequent increase in the ATP/ADP ratio block ATP-sensitive K+ channels, resulting in depolarization of the membrane potentials of the pancreatic beta cells, followed by the influx of extracellular Ca2+ into the cells. As a consequence, the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration increases, and the cells secrete insulin through exocytosis. Therefore, the impairment of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria could be the cause of diabetes mellitus through defective insulin secretion. Recently, heteroplasmy of wild type mtDNA and mutant mtDNA with large scale deletions, including several tRNA genes (10Holt I.J. Harding A.E. Morgan-Hughes J.A.

More recently, evidence of the presence of various mtDNA mutations in blood, fibroblasts, and muscle has been reported in cases of diabetes mellitus; in a pedigree with maternally transmitted diabetes mellitus and deafness, Ballinger et al. (21Ballinger S.W. Shoffner J.M. Hedaya E.V. Trounce I. Polak M.A. Koontz D.A. Wallace D.C. Nat.

Then, the point mutation in the tRNALeu(UUR) gene at position 3243, which had been observed in about 90% of patients with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS), was identified in more than 1% of patients with diabetes mellitus (23van den Ouweland J.M.W.

However, there is as yet no direct or convincing evidence that these mtDNA mutations are present in pancreatic beta cells or that the dysfunction of oxidative phosphorylation induced by the mutant mtDNA in mitochondria of pancreatic beta cells is responsible for the pathogeneses of diabetes mellitus. The aim of the present study is to determine experimentally whether impairment of the mitochondrial respiratory function could be a pathogenic factor for diabetes mellitus using a mouse pancreatic beta cell line, MIN6, which retains the phenotype of secretion of insulin in response to the extracellular glucose concentration (27Miyazaki J.

The results showed that the property of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was totally lost on mtDNA knockout, i.e. depletion of mtDNA, in the ρ0 MIN6 cells, whereas it could be reversibly restored by repopulation with foreign mtDNA through the fusion of the cells with enucleated cytoplasts from a mouse fibroblast cell line, suggesting that mtDNA and the mitochondrial respiratory function are necessary for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. A mouse pancreatic islet beta cell line, MIN6 cells, established from a transgenic mouse harboring an insulin promoter plus SV40 T antigen fusion construct (27Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E.

Total DNA (1 μg) extracted from 2 × 105 cells was digested with a single cut restriction enzyme, XhoI, and the restriction fragments were separated by 0.6% agarose gel electrophoresis. After blotting onto a Nytran membrane, the DNA fragments were hybridized with [α-32P]dATP-labeled mouse mtDNA. The radioactivity of the fragments was measured with a BAS2000 bioimaging analyzer (Fujix, Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). Total cellular RNA was extracted with an Isogen RNA isolation kit (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan). Total denatured RNA (10 μg) was electrophoresed on a 1.1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and then transferred onto a Nytran membrane. The membrane was hybridized with a [α-32P]dATP-labeled mouse mtDNA fragment (COI and COII) or rat insulin I cDNA probe (30Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Anai M. Kikuchi M.

The radioactivity of the bands was measured with a BAS2000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film). Mitochondrial translation products were labeled with [35S]methionine as described previously (20Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. Takai D. Miyabayashi S. Tada K. Fukushima H. Inui K. Okada S. Goto Y.

Briefly, semiconfluent cells in a dish were incubated in methionine-free medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at 37°C. Then, the cells were labeled with [35S]methionine in methionine-free medium containing 0.2% FCS for 1 h in the presence of emetine (0.2 mg/ml). The mitochondrial fraction was obtained by homogenization in 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, and 10 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, followed by differential centrifugation. Proteins in the mitochondrial fraction (15 mg/lane) were separated by SDS 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The dried gel was exposed to an imaging plate for 18 h and the labeled polypeptide was analyzed with a BAS2000 bioimaging analyzer. The activities of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) were assayed as described previously (31Miyabayashi S. Narisawa K. Iinuma K. Tada K.

J. 1961; 80: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, respectively). MIN6 and ρ0 MIN6 cells were incubated in the medium with 0.1 or 25 mM glucose for 1 h, and then O2 consumption was measured as follows; cells (5 × 106) were trypsinized and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1 or 25 mM glucose, and O2 consumption of cells was recorded in a polarographic cell (1.0 ml) at 37°C with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument Co.) (33Kaneko M. Kodama M. Inoue F. Terasaki T. Free Radical Res. 1996; 24: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The intracellular free Ca2+ concentration was measured according to the procedure of Yada et al. (34Yada T. Itoh K. Nakata M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1685-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, MIN6 cells were cultivated on a glass coverslip in a 6-cm dish and then incubated with 10 μM fura-2/AM for 30 min at 37°C in Hepes-balanced Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer containing 0.1 mM glucose. The cells were then placed on the stage of an inverted microscope and superfused at 1 ml/min at 37°C with KRB and a basal (0.1 mM) or stimulatory (25 mM) glucose concentration. When delivering and removing superfusate, fura-2 dual excitation (340 and 380 nm) and fluorescence detection (510 nm) were accomplished with an Arugus-50/CA image analysis system (Hamamatu Photonics Inc., Hamamatsu, Japan), and the 340-, 380-, and 340/380-nm ratio signals were recorded continuously. The intracellular free Ca2+ concentration is expressed in all records as the 340/380 nm ratio. MIN6 cells (1 × 105 cells) were seeded into 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing glucose (25 mM) in 24-well plates. Insulin secretion was determined using a static incubation method in 5% CO2 at 37°C with KRB buffer as described previously (28Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Inukai H. Anai M. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Miyazaki J.-I. Oka Y. Diabetelogia. 1993; 36: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The glucose concentration was 0.1 mM, and the glucose stimulation was carried out in 25 mM glucose. The secreted insulin levels in media were assayed for immunoreactive insulin by radioimmunoassay using rat insulin as a standard. To each well, 200 μl of 1 mM NaOH was added to solubilize the cells for determination of the cellular protein content with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. For measurement of intracellular insulin content, 1 mM acid ethanol was added to the wells, which were then sealed with pressure-sensitive film. The extract was collected after 24 h incubation at 4°C, diluted, and assayed by radioimmunoassay. Intercellular mtDNA transfer was carried out by fusion of enucleated B82CAP cells with ρ0 MIN6 cells as described previously (16Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kikuchi A. Takematsu M. Goto Y.-i. Nonaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10614-10618Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, B82CAP cells grown on round glass discs were enucleated by centrifugation (13,000 rpm at 34°C for 12 min) in the presence of cytochalasin B (10 μg/ml; Sigma). The resulting cytoplasts were mixed with ρ0 MIN6 cells, and then fusion was carried out in the presence of 50% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1500 (Boehringer Mannheim). The fusion mixture was cultivated in a selective medium without glucose (DM170; Kyokuto Kagaku, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine and 15% FCS (16Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kikuchi A. Takematsu M. Goto Y.-i. Nonaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10614-10618Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In this selective medium the residual nonenucleated parental B82CAP cells were completely eliminated with hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine. Unfused parental ρ0 MIN6 cells were removed with DM170 medium, since they could not grow in the medium without glucose due to the absence of mtDNA. On days 35-50 after the fusion, colonies that had grown in the selective medium were cloned by the cylinder method. The clones were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (25 M glucose and 15% FCS) containing 100 μg/ml CAP. The chromosome compositions of cybrid clones were analyzed immediately after cloning using air-dried chromosome preparations as described previously (35Hayashi J.-I. Tagashira Y. Watanabe T. Yoshida M.C. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 3957-3960PubMed Google Scholar). A mtDNA knockout MIN6 cell line, ρ0 MIN6, was used to investigate the influence of a deficiency of mtDNA on the mitochondrial respiratory function and on the phenotypic expression of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion observed in parental MIN6 cells. In mtDNA-depleted ρ0 MIN6 cells, mtDNA and its transcripts, such as those of the COI and COII genes encoding COX subunits, were not detected (Fig. 1, a and b). The overall absence of mitochondrial translation products was confirmed by [35S]methionine incorporation into mitochondrially synthesized polypeptides in the presence of emetine; no labeled polypeptides were detectable in ρ0 MIN6 cells (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the amount of transcripts of the insulin gene did not change substantially (Fig. 1b). Therefore, complete inhibition of transcription and translation in mitochondria was attained through the mtDNA depletion in the ρ0 MIN6 cells without inhibition of transcription of the insulin gene.Fig. 2Analysis of mitochondrial translation products in MIN6 and ρ0MIN6 cells. After specific [35S]methionine labeling of mitochondrial translation products, proteins (15 mg/lane) in the mitochondrial fraction were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ND5, COI, ND4, Cytb, ND2, ND1, COII, COIII, ATP6, ND6, ND3, ATP8, and ND4L, polypeptides assigned to mtDNA genes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Then, we analyzed the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities of COX, in which subunits were encoded by both mtDNA and nuclear DNA, and of SDH, in which all subunits were exclusively encoded by nuclear DNA. The results showed that COX activity was completely absent (Fig. 3), probably due to the absence of three COX subunits (COI, COII, and COIII) encoded by mtDNA (Fig. 2), suggesting inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain function, whereas SDH activity remained at normal or slightly elevated levels in ρ0 MIN6 cells (Fig. 3). Thus, the inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities was limited to enzymes that include subunits encoded by mtDNA. Moreover, the observations that ρ0 MIN6 cells showed normal SDH activity (Fig. 3) and normal transcription of the insulin gene (Fig. 1b) suggest that the deficiency of the mitochondrial respiratory function in the cells is not due to a cytotoxic side effect derived from the mtDNA knockout. First, we confirmed that the glucose oxidation deduced from the O2 consumption was increased by the glucose stimulation in MIN6 cells but not in ρ0 MIN6 cells (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the amounts of transcripts of the insulin gene in both cells did not change by the glucose stimulation (Fig. 1b). Moreover, intracellular insulin contents in MIN6 and ρ0 MIN6 cells in the low glucose concentration were similar (4436.3 ± 201.7 and 4734.7 ± 297.9 pmol/mg protein, respectively) and did not change substantially by the glucose stimulation. Then, we examined whether the inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain function induced by mtDNA depletion in ρ0 MIN6 cells could affect the phenotypic expression of glucose-stimulated increases in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration and insulin secretion, which had been observed in the parental MIN6 cells. Measurement of the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration by loading fura-2 revealed that the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration in the parental MIN6 cells increased in response to extracellular glucose stimulation (25 mM glucose) (Fig. 5a) in a similar way to that observed in pancreatic β cells isolated from islets of mice and rats (34Yada T. Itoh K. Nakata M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1685-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Duchen M.R. Smith P.A. Ashcroft F.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration in the ρ0 MIN6 cells did not change substantially with glucose stimulation (Fig. 5b). These observations suggest that the glucose-stimulated increase in intracellular free Ca2+ is totally inhibited by the mtDNA deficiency in ρ0 MIN6 cells and thus support the idea that the mitochondrial respiratory chain function is necessary for the phenotypic expression of glucose-stimulated influx of Ca2+ in normal pancreatic β cells. Since it has been generally proposed that the glucose-stimulated influx of Ca2+ into cells is necessary to induce the metabolic processes for insulin secretion, we compared the properties of insulin secretion in response to the extracellular glucose concentration between the parental MIN6 and ρ0 MIN6 cells. The results shown in Fig. 6 suggest that the basal secreted amount of insulin in the normal MIN6 cells was extremely low, but the amount of insulin secretion progressively increased to about 3-7-fold greater than the basal amount with glucose stimulation (25 mM glucose) (28Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Inukai H. Anai M. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Miyazaki J.-I. Oka Y. Diabetelogia. 1993; 36: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 30Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Anai M. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Miyazaki J. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3081-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary, the progressive enhancement of insulin secretion by glucose stimulation was not observed in ρ0 MIN6 cells, even though the basal insulin secretion level was very similar to that in normal cells (Fig. 6). These observations consistently support the idea that the increase in glucose oxidation activity via the mitochondrial respiratory function plays significant roles in the glucose-stimulated influx of Ca2+ into pancreatic beta cells and the subsequent induction of insulin secretion. The intercellular transfer of exogenous mtDNA into ρ0 MIN6 cells and their mtDNA repopulation were carried out to determine whether the depletion of mtDNA was specifically responsible for the impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in ρ0 MIN6 cells or whether nuclear factors were also involved in this process. The cytoplasmic transfer of exogenous mtDNA into ρ0 MIN6 cells was attained through the fusion of ρ0 MIN6 cells with enucleated B82CAP, which is a mouse fibroblast-derived cell line and is resistant to BrdUrd and CAP (29Hayashi J.-I. Gotoh O. Tagashira Y. Tosu M. Sekiguchi T. Yoshida M.C. Somatic Cell. Genet. 1982; 8: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Then, the fusion mixture was selected with DM170 and hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (see “Experimental Procedures”) to remove parental B82CAP and ρ0 MIN6 cells, respectively. Consequently, six clones (CBM-1-CBM-6) that grew in the selective medium were collected (Table I). Since these clones expressed the CAP-resistant phenotype and grew in the presence of CAP, the possibility that these clones were revertant MIN6 cells that had recovered MIN6 mtDNA can be excluded. In this mtDNA transfer system, however, as no selection method to remove hybrid cells (fusion products between ρ0 MIN6 and nonenucleated B82CAP cells) was available, the six clones that grew in the selective medium with DM170 and hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine were either cybrid clones (fusion products between ρ0 MIN6 and enucleated B82CAP cells, i.e. revertant MIN6 cells by the introduction of mtDNA from B82CAP cells) or hybrid clones. Then, karyotype analysis was carried out, and the results showed that the modal chromosome number of all six clones we isolated was 42 (40Dunbar D.R. Moonie P.A. Swingler R.J. Davidson D. Roberts R.

Recovery of the mtDNA population and COX activity by the six clones was confirmed by Southern blot analysis and by means of a biochemical assay (Table I). These observations suggest that the clones we isolated were cybrid clones.Table I.Somatic cell genetical characteristics and chromosome complement of parent cells and cybrid clonesCell lineDrug resistancear, -resistant; s, -sensitive.SelectionmtDNAChromosome numberbThe modal chromosome number was obtained from 25 metaphases.Parent cell linesMIN6(BrdUrds, CAPs)+42ρ0 MIN6BrdUrds−42B82CAPBrdUrdr, CAPr+51Cybrid clonesCBM-1BrdUrds, CAPrDM170 + HAT+41CBM-2BrdUrds, CAPrDM170 + HAT+42CBM-3BrdUrds, CAPrDM170 + HAT+42CBM-4BrdUrds, CAPrDM170 + HAT+42CBM-5BrdUrds, CAPrDM170 + HAT+42CBM-6BrdUrds, CAPrDM170 + HAT+42a r, -resistant; s, -sensitive.b The modal chromosome number was obtained from 25 metaphases. Open table in a new tab Using two cybrid clones, CBM-1 and CBM-2, we examined whether the property of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which was missing in ρ0 MIN6 cells, could be restored by the introduction and repopulation of mtDNA from fibroblast cell line B82CAP. As shown in Fig. 6, a progressive increase in the amount of secreted insulin in response to the extracellular glucose concentration was observed in both CBM-1 and CBM-2, suggesting the recovery of the missing glucose sensitivity through the introduction of mtDNA. Therefore, our observations in this study clearly provided unambiguous evidence that mtDNA and the mitochondrial respiration function in pancreatic beta cells are necessary for the glucose-stimulated increases in the intracellular free Ca2+ content and insulin secretion. In this study, we showed experimentally that mtDNA and the mitochondrial respiratory function in pancreatic beta cells are necessary for the phenotypic expression of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion using a pancreatic beta cell line, MIN6 (a normal line), and two its derivative lines, i.e. mtDNA knockout ρ0 MIN6 (a mutant line) and mtDNA repopulated cybrid MIN6 (a revertant line).

Moreover, the clinical association of diabetes mellitus with deafness and various neurological disorders, including chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)/Kearns-Sayre syndrome; Pearson's bone marrow pancreas syndrome; mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS); and myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), was also reported (for review, see 8Gerbitz K.D. van den Ouweland J.M. Maassen J.A. Jaksch M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Evidence of the involvement of mtDNA mutations in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus was reported in two pedigrees with maternally transmitted diabetes mellitus and deafness, one pedigree had a 10.4-kilobase large scale mtDNA deletion (21Ballinger S.W. Shoffner J.M. Hedaya E.V. Trounce I. Polak M.A. Koontz D.A. Wallace D.C. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), which seemed to be very similar to that reported in patients with Leigh syndrome (22Miyabayashi S. Hanamizu H. Endo H. Tada K. Horai S. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1991; 14: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the other had a mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episode (MELAS)-specific mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) mutation at nucleotide position 3243 (23van den Ouweland J.M.W. Lemkes H.H. Ruitenbeek W. Sandkuijl L.A. de Vijlder M.F. Struyvenberg P.A. van den Kamp J.J. Maassen J.A. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). The former mutation was subsequently shown to be derived from partially duplicated mtDNA through rearrangement (41Ballinger S.W. Shoffner J.M. Gebhart S. Koontz D.A. Wallace D.C. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 458-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the latter tRNALeu(UUR) 3243 mutation was prevalently found in peripheral leukocytes and muscle of more than 1% patients with diabetes mellitus (8Gerbitz K.D. van den Ouweland J.M. Maassen J.A. Jaksch M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), indicating that these mutations could contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. More recently, several point mutations other than that at nucleotide position 3243 in the tRNALeu(UUR) gene (42Moraes C.T. Ciacci F. Bonilla E. Jansen C. Hirano M. Rao N. Lovelace R.E. Rowland L.P. Schon E.A. DiMauro S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2906-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and point mutations in the tRNALys gene at 8344 (43Suzuki S. Hinokio Y. Hirai S. Onoda M.

Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 1026-1033PubMed Google Scholar) were also observed in patients with diabetes mellitus. However, there is as yet no convincing evidence that the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by these mtDNA mutations is responsible for the pathogenesis of the disease, although it had already been shown that the accumulation of some of the mtDNA mutations in cultured somatic cell lines was sufficient to induce the mitochondrial dysfunction through inhibition of overall mitochondrial translation (16Hayashi J.-I.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19060-19066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the pathogenic mtDNA mutations, mtDNA depletion could also be a candidate pathogenic factor for the development of diabetes mellitus. Actually, there are several lines of evidence that support this possibility. First, the inhibition of overall mitochondrial translation followed by impairment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain function was similarly induced irrespective of whether the accumulation of mtDNA mutations or mtDNA depletion occurred in cells (16Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kikuchi A. Takematsu M. Goto Y.-i. Nonaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10614-10618Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Second, depletion of mtDNA in various tissues (muscle, liver, and kidney) was reported in fatal mitochondrial encephalomyopathies (46Moraes C.T. Shanske S. Tritschler H.J. Aprille J.R. Andreetta F. Bonilla E. Schon E.A. DiMauro S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 492-501PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that mtDNA depletion could be responsible for the clinical features of diabetes mellitus in the same way as in the case of the accumulation the pathogenic mtDNA mutations, such as the tRNALeu(UUR) 3243 mutation. Third, one of the diabetogenic agents, streptzotocin, which has been widely used for the induction of pancreatic islet injury and experimental diabetes mellitus, was found to reduce the contents of mtDNA and its transcripts in pancreatic islets (47Erizirik D.L. Sandler S. Ahnstrom G. Welsh M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 2275-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in Goto-Kakizaki rats, which have frequently been used as genetic model rats of impaired insulin secretion, a progressive and selective decrease of the mtDNA content (about 30%) was also observed in adult pancreatic islets but not in fetal ones (48Serradas P. Giroix M.H. Saulnier C. Gangnerau M.N. Borg L.A. Welsh M. Portha B. Welsh N. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5623-5631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examined whether impairment of the respiratory chain function in mitochondria induced by the mtDNA knockout, i.e. mtDNA depletion, could be a pathogenic factor for the development of some forms of diabetes mellitus. The results showed that the mtDNA depletion induced overall impairment of mitochondrial translation (Fig. 2), and the resultant loss of mitochondrial respiration activity (Fig. 3), without inhibition of transcription of the insulin gene (Fig. 1b) or loss of SDH activity (Fig. 3), indicating that the induced mitochondrial dysfunction was not due to a cytotoxic side effect derived from the mtDNA depletion. Moreover, the mtDNA depletion also inhibited the glucose-stimulated increases in both the intracellular free Ca2+ content (Fig. 5) and insulin secretion (Fig. 6) in ρ0 MIN6 cells. These observations suggest that mtDNA and the mitochondrial respiratory function are necessary to express the phenotypes of glucose-stimulated Ca2+ influx and insulin secretion in MIN6 cells. The possibility of the involvement of nuclear genome-encoded factors as well as a cytotoxic side effect in this process was excluded completely by the observation that the missing sensitivity to the extracellular glucose level observed in the ρ0 MIN6 cells was restored reversibly by the repopulation of the cells with foreign mtDNA through fusion with cytoplasts from a mouse fibroblast cell line, B82CAP (Fig. 6). Therefore, these findings constitute unambiguous evidence for the involvement of mtDNA in the pathogeneses of some forms of diabetes mellitus. Moreover, our results substantially support the proposed glucose-signaling hypothesis (9Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Insulin-Molecular Biology to Pathology. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1992: 97Google Scholar) that mitochondria in pancreatic beta cells plays a significant role in such a way that the ATP production and subsequent increase in the ATP/ADP ratio block ATP-sensitive K+ channels, resulting in depolarization of the membrane potentials of pancreatic beta cells, followed by the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and insulin secretion. We are now investigating whether the predominance of mutant mtDNA molecules with large scale deletion mutations also induce disruption of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in MIN6 cells by isolating mouse cell lines containing large scale deletion mutant mtDNA molecules and subsequently transferring them cytoplasmically into ρ0 MIN6 cells. We are grateful to Takuji Kataoka (Hamamatu Photonics) for instruction in using the Arugus-50/CA image analysis system."

INTRODUCTIONVoltage-gated K+ channels are involved in a considerable number of physiological functions including neuronal integration, cardiac pacemaking, and hormone secretion. In excitable cells, they contribute to set the membrane resting potential and determine the frequency and duration of action potentials. Electrophysiological studies have identified several subtypes of voltage-gated K+ channels with different kinetics, voltage-dependences, and pharmacological properties (1Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 1Google Scholar, 2Rudy B. Neuroscience. 1988; 25: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The purification and functional reconstitution in lipid bilayers of the α-dendrotoxine sensitive K+ channels from rat brain has initially revealed that this class of channels is made of the assembly of α subunits (70-80 kDa) associated with smaller β subunits (38-42 kDa) (3Rehm H.

On the other hand, molecular biology techniques have now lead to the identification of more than 20 mammalian genes encoding K+ channels α-subunits and cloning has also recently led to new structural and functional information concerning hydrophilic K+ channel β subunits (Kvβ) (for a review, see 6Pongs O.

However, Kvβ1.2 and Kvβ2.1 subunits have also been reported to increase the rate of inactivation of Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 channels, also they do not seem to contain an inactivation ball (11Morales M.J.

Wible B.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). β subunits not only change channel kinetics, they can also change voltage-dependences of α subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes as recently shown for the co-injection of Kvβ1.3 with Kv1.5 (10England S.K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28531-28534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).This paper describes the cloning and localization of a new K+ channel β subunit cDNA from mouse brain. This 249-amino acid β subunit is the shortest of all the Kvβ subunits cloned till now. It is highly expressed in the brain but it is also present in different tissues, particularly in kidney. Unlike other β subunits, mKvβ4 is without any effect on members of the Kv1 (Shaker) K+ channel family but it specifically enhances the expression of Kv2.2 (CDRK) in Xenopus oocytes, without affecting the inactivation properties. Therefore, its main role appears to be that of a chaperone-like protein to direct more efficiently the Kv2.2 α subunit to its physiological location at the plasma membrane.DISCUSSIONExpression studies have shown that many of the cloned α subunits of voltage-dependent ion channels (Na+, Ca2+, and K+) were functional on their own, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, but that they then exhibited pharmacological and biophysical properties sometimes different from native channels. In the last years, many auxiliary subunits have been described (see for reviews, 33Isom L.L. Dejongh K.S. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 34Aldrich R.W. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 839-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 35Adelman J.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Their physiological role is a regulation of the function of the α subunits to which they associate. So far, auxiliary subunits β1 and β2 have been cloned for voltage-sensitive Na+ channels (see 36Catterall W.A. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S2-S47Crossref Google Scholar, for review). One of their primary roles has been shown to stabilize Na+ channels expression at the plasma membrane resulting in a 5-10-fold increase in the number of active voltage-sensitive Na+ channels (36Catterall W.A. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S2-S47Crossref Google Scholar). Not only the functional effects of these β subunits lead to an increased peak current, but it is also associated with a change of activation and inactivation kinetics and a modification of the voltage dependence of the inactivation process (see 33Isom L.L. Dejongh K.S. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, for review). Voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels are formed by a complex of subunits designated as α1, α2, δ, β, and γ. The α1 subunit is the pore-forming protein. The other subunits have a regulatory function, they are essential for a solid expression of the α1 subunit of different types of channels such as cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels, N-type Ca2+ channels, or P-type Ca2+ channels (see 33Isom L.L. Dejongh K.S. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The modulating effects of the β subunits also results in a change of both the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the α1 subunit (36Catterall W.A. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S2-S47Crossref Google Scholar). Auxiliary subunits called β subunits (Kvβ) have also been identified for voltage-sensitive K+ channels (3Rehm H. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4919-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 37Trimmer J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10764-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) as well as for the Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BK) (38Knauss H.-G. Garcia-Calvo M. Kaczorowski J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3921-3924PubMed Google Scholar).Coexpression of some of the cloned Kvβ subunits confers rapid A-type inactivation on non-inactivating delayed rectifiers Kv1 channels when expressed in the Xenopus oocyte (11Morales M.J. Castellino R.C. Crews A.L. Rasmusson R.L. Strauss H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6272-6277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 12Majumder K. De Biassi M. Wang Z.

K+ channel α and β subunits seem to use inactivating domains that have similar properties. A-type Kv channels have an inactivating domain (“α ball”) in their NH2-terminal sequence that can rapidly obturate the internal mouth of the channel upon membrane depolarization (39Ruppersberg J.P. Stocker M.L. Pongs O. Heinemann S.H. Frank R. Koenen M. Nature. 1991; 352: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). A ball and chain mechanism has been proposed to explain the NH2-terminal (N-type) inactivation of A-type α subunits (40Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Kvβ1 subunits also contain a “β ball” in their NH2-terminal end with structural similarities to the α ball. Therefore, both α and β subunits seem to provide a “ball domain” for an inactivating N-type mechanism. The β ball contains a critical cysteine residue which seems to be sensitive to the intracellular redox state as well as a cluster of positively charged amino acids (6Pongs O. Semin. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 137-146Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This paper describes a new member of the Kvβ subunit family, mKvβ4. With its 249 amino acids, it is the shortest of all the previously cloned subunits. It has no inactivating ball motif in its amino terminus, suggesting that it cannot modify the inactivation properties of non-inactivating or slowly inactivating or even rapidly inactivating K+ channels. Indeed, mKvβ4 did not modify the electrophysiological expression in Xenopus oocytes of a variety of Kv α subunits such as Kv1.4 or Kv1.5 whose properties are altered by other previously cloned β subunits.It turns out that the sequence of mKvβ4 is very similar to the sequence of a rat Kvβ3 (14Heinemann S.H. Rettig J. Wunder F. Pongs O. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, a major difference exists between these two β subunits at the NH2 terminus. The NH2-terminal end of rKvβ3 has the β ball motif (14Heinemann S.H. Rettig J. Wunder F. Pongs O. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas the NH2-terminal end of mKvβ4 does not have it. It is therefore not very surprising that rKvβ3, unlike mKvβ4, changes the kinetics of a non-inactivating α subunit such as the NH2-terminal deleted form of Kv1.4. Unlike mKvβ4, rKvβ3 is not expressed in kidney or in hippocampus and dentate gyrus (14Heinemann S.H. Rettig J. Wunder F. Pongs O. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).mKvβ4 assayed in the Xenopus oocyte expression system had no effect on Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kv1.4, and Kv1.5 α subunits or on the other K+ channel α subunits in the other subfamilies such as Kv3.4 or Kv4.1 or on the K+ channel activity produced by IsK. It specifically altered the expression of the Kv2.2 (CDRK) α subunit. The physical association of mKvβ4 with the Kv2.2 α subunit was shown by co-immunoprecipitation from baculovirus-infected insect cells. The function of this β subunit seems to facilitate the trafficking of this particular α subunit toward the plasma membrane. It could even be that Kv2.2 is normally unable to go to the plasma membrane in the absence of mKvβ4 and that its successful expression is due to the presence, in oocyte, of an endogenous β subunit analogous to mKvβ4. This sort of situation has recently been described for GIRK1, one of the major G-protein regulated inward rectifiers which expresses at the oocyte membrane only because it forms an heterologous assembly with another endogenous Xenopus subunit (41Hedin K.A. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).That one subunit facilitates the access and integration of another subunit in the plasma membrane is not surprising and there are many other precedents of this situation in the channel field. For example, the amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel is formed of three subunits α, β, and γ. In the colon (42Lingueglia E. Renard S. Waldmann R. Voilley N. Champigny G. Plass H. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13736-13739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Renard S. Voilley N. Bassilana F. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. Pflueg. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), it is the association with β and γ that brings the functional subunit α to the plasma membrane. The α subunit by itself, hardly integrates into the surface membrane. Another example is channel-inducing factor (44Attali B. Latter H. Rachamim N. Garty H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This protein with a single transmembrane segment associate with K+ channel subunits intrinsic to the oocyte to reveal a slow K+ channel activity which is not detectable in its absence. The amplitudes of the Ca2+ currents of the α1 subunits of class A, class B N-type, class D L-type, and class E brain Ca2+ channels are also greatly increased by coexpression of α2δ and β subunits (see 33Isom L.L. Dejongh K.S. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, for review).The striking property of mKvβ4 is that it distinguishes between the two clones in the Shab subfamily Kv2.1 (DRK1) and Kv2.2 (CDRK). Not only Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 display very similar delayed rectifier properties, but they also have a very high sequence homology in the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain (86% identity), in core transmembrane domains (95% identity) as well as in the first 195-amino acid sequence of the COOH terminus immediately after the transmembrane domain (63% identity). However, the last amino acids in the COOH-terminal part of the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain are very different in the two channel structures. The fact that mKvβ4 selectively enhances the expression of Kv2.2 and not of Kv2.1 is a first indication that the COOH-terminal part of Kv2.2 could be a target for association with mKvβ4 and indeed removal of the COOH-terminal end of Kv2.2 or replacement of this COOH-terminal end by the COOH termini of Kv2.1 abolishes the enhancing effect of mKvβ4.It was recently demonstrated that the COOH terminus of Kvβ1 associates to the NH2 terminus of Kv1 α subunits (15Sewing S. Roeper J. Pongs O. Neuron. 1996; 16: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32Yu W. Xu J. Li M. Neuron. 1996; 16: 441-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although mKvβ4 has a truncated COOH terminus relative to Kvβ1, the amino acid similarity in this region is about 85%. Consequently, the observed association of mKvβ4 with Kv1.5 in infected insect cells is not surprising. However, the two types of interaction, mKvβ4-Kv2.2 and mKvβ4-Kv1.5, seem to be of a different nature. mKvβ4 probably associates to the NH2 terminus of Kv1.5 as shown for Kvβ1 while it probably associates to the COOH terminus of Kv2.2 as suggested by the mutagenesis study presented above. The different types of associations with the 2 different families of Kv α subunits could explain that the functional effect of mKvβ4 was only seen on Kv2.2 expression and was absent on the expression of Kv1.5 or other Kv1 α subunits.Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 have different distributions in the brain and the distribution of mKvβ4 coincides with the distribution of Kv2.2. High expression levels of mKvβ4 are present in hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum. As for Kv2.2 (22Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Bredt D.S. Yellen G. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 473-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), intense labeling for mKvβ4 was observed in the granule cells. As for Kv2.2 (22Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Bredt D.S. Yellen G. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 473-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), transcripts of mKvβ4 are present in the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1-CA4 region of hippocampus as well as in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. As for Kv2.2 (22Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Bredt D.S. Yellen G. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 473-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), a prominent signal associated with mKvβ4 is present in the cerebellum particularly in granular cells and not in the molecular layer. Moreover, as Kv2.2, mKvβ4 is mainly expressed in the brain, is expressed at a lower level in the kidney, and is not expressed at all in heart or in skeletal muscle while Kv2.1 is a very ubiquitous channel expressed at high level not only in the brain but also in the kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle. The coincidence of these distributions of Kv2.2 and mKvβ4 strongly suggests that in most places where it is produced, Kv2.2 associates with mKvβ4 to form a K+ channel. When they are present in the same neuronal cells, Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 are differently distributed (29Hwang P.M. Cunningham A.M. Peng Y.W. Snyder S.H. Neuroscience. 1993; 55: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Hwang P.M. Fotuhi M. Bredt D.S. Cunningham A.M. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kv2.2 seems to be predominantly localized diffusely in the soma and in fibers while Kv2.1 seems to be present mainly in soma and dendritic processes. It may well be that one prominent role of mKvβ4 is to help Kv2.2 find its normal functional localization in the neuronal cell.Experiments presented in Fig. 5 clearly shows that the injection of Kv2.2 and mKvβ4 at the same time with the same pipette is required for an efficient increase of Kv2.2 expression. Clearly the two subunits have to assemble first before integration occurs at the surface membrane to form a K+ channel. Making the assembly difficult by injecting the two different subunits at the same time but at different location in the oocyte, or at two different times, is counter-productive for Kv2.2 expression.To our knowledge, this is the first example of a β subunit that physically associate to Kv2.2, a pore-forming subunit which does not belong to the Shaker (Kv1) subfamily. Association of mKvβ4 with Kv2.2 does not alter the kinetic properties but increase the α subunit synthesis and/or stability. While this paper was submitted for publication, Shi et al. (45Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) reported an increase in Kv1.2 surface expression due to Kvβ2 expression. One chaperone-like effect of Kvβ2 is to increase stability of Kvβ2-Kv1.2 complexes as suggested for mKvβ4-Kv2.2. On the other hand, mKvβ4 is also able to bind Kv1.5 subunit without the alterations observed on Kv2.2 expression. The exact role and physiological consequence of this association remains to be determined in tissues expressing other Kvβ subunits. INTRODUCTIONVoltage-gated K+ channels are involved in a considerable number of physiological functions including neuronal integration, cardiac pacemaking, and hormone secretion. In excitable cells, they contribute to set the membrane resting potential and determine the frequency and duration of action potentials. Electrophysiological studies have identified several subtypes of voltage-gated K+ channels with different kinetics, voltage-dependences, and pharmacological properties (1Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 1Google Scholar, 2Rudy B. Neuroscience. 1988; 25: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The purification and functional reconstitution in lipid bilayers of the α-dendrotoxine sensitive K+ channels from rat brain has initially revealed that this class of channels is made of the assembly of α subunits (70-80 kDa) associated with smaller β subunits (38-42 kDa) (3Rehm H. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4919-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Bidard J.N. Mourre C. Lazdunski M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

On the other hand, molecular biology techniques have now lead to the identification of more than 20 mammalian genes encoding K+ channels α-subunits and cloning has also recently led to new structural and functional information concerning hydrophilic K+ channel β subunits (Kvβ) (for a review, see 6Pongs O. Semin. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 137-146Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The Kvβ1 family has 3 members: Kvβ1.1, Kvβ1.2, and Kvβ1.3, which are alternative spliced products from the same gene, their calculated molecular masses are 44-47 kDa (7Scott V.E.S. Rettig J.

https://openalex.org/W2088974335,"Polypeptides of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family are ubiquitous bioregulators within tissues whose activity is controlled by heparan sulfates within the pericellular matrix. FGF and the ectodomain of their transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFR) exhibit heparin-binding domains that when juxtaposed in a FGF·FGFR complex can accommodate a single, potentially bivalent, decameric polysaccharide chain in a ternary complex. Here we show that the interaction of heparin with FGF ligands is not affected by divalent cations. In contrast, the high affinity interaction (apparent Kd = 10 nM) of heparin with FGFR requires Ca2+ or Mg2+ at physiological concentrations. Divalent cations maintain FGFR in a heparan sulfate-dependent state in respect to FGF binding and an FGF- and heparan sulfate-dependent state in respect to autophosphorylation. A model is proposed where divalent cations and heparan sulfate cooperate to maintain FGFR in a conformation that restricts trans-phosphorylation between intracellular kinase domains. The restriction is overcome by FGF or constitutively as a common consequence of diverse mutations in FGFR associated with skeletal and craniofacial abnormalities. Polypeptides of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family are ubiquitous bioregulators within tissues whose activity is controlled by heparan sulfates within the pericellular matrix. FGF and the ectodomain of their transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFR) exhibit heparin-binding domains that when juxtaposed in a FGF·FGFR complex can accommodate a single, potentially bivalent, decameric polysaccharide chain in a ternary complex. Here we show that the interaction of heparin with FGF ligands is not affected by divalent cations. In contrast, the high affinity interaction (apparent Kd = 10 nM) of heparin with FGFR requires Ca2+ or Mg2+ at physiological concentrations. Divalent cations maintain FGFR in a heparan sulfate-dependent state in respect to FGF binding and an FGF- and heparan sulfate-dependent state in respect to autophosphorylation.

The growth rates of these mutant strains were significantly lower in a manganese-deficient medium and were restored to near normal levels upon addition of micromolar concentrations of Mn2+, indicating the presence of a second transport system for manganese in this organism. 54Mn2+ uptake experiments indicated that the MntABC transporter was induced under manganese starvation conditions, whereas the second transporter system was induced in the presence of micromolar levels of manganese. Both of these systems were nonfunctional at low temperatures and could transport trace levels of 54Mn2+, reflecting high affinity active transport. The initial rates of Mn2+ uptake for cells grown with or without manganese exhibited biphasic saturation kinetics, suggesting that Mn2+ can also be accumulated by a low affinity system in these bacteria. The kinetic parameters for the MntABC transporter system are Km = 1-3 μM and Vmax = 3-8 pmol/min·108 cells. Accumulation of manganese by this system was competitively inhibited by Cd2+ (Ki = 4-8 μM), Co2+ and Zn2+ (Ki = 8-15 μM). In contrast, the second high affinity system was highly specific for manganese and was not inhibited by any tested metal ion.

Here we report that human nonpancreatic phospholipase A2 isolated from a transfected cell line binds to glycosaminoglycans secreted by cultured human arterial smooth muscle cells. A gel mobility shift assay showed that the affinity of phospholipase A2 for glycosaminoglycans from a heparan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan was higher than for chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans from a larger versican-like proteoglycan. Affinity chromatography confirmed these results. All glycosaminoglycans tested, at concentrations up to 100 μM, increased the activity of phospholipase A2 toward phosphatidylcholine liposomes. Above this concentration, heparan sulfate and heparin inhibited the enzyme. Heparin and chondroitin 6-sulfate increased phospholipase A2 activity on low density lipoproteins up to 4-fold at 100 μM, whereas heparan sulfate had no effect.

Recently, we have demonstrated that this enzyme system exists in epidermal keratinocytes in several forms that are differentially partitioned between the cytosol and membranes. The cytosolic enzyme exists as a full-length form of 106 kDa of low specific activity and two proteolytically processed forms that have 5-10-fold higher specific activities, one of 67 kDa and a second consisting of 67 and 33 kDa fragments that are held together by noncovalent bonds. Together, these three forms constitute from about 5%, to up to 35%, of the total TGase 1 enzyme activity in proliferating or terminally differentiating cells, respectively (10Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18026-18035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The membrane-bound enzyme exists in two forms: a full-length essentially inactive zymogen; or a complex of 67/33/10 kDa chains that is very highly active (11Steinert P.M. Chung S.-I. Kim S.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The membrane-bound zymogen form constitutes the bulk of TGase 1 protein in keratinocytes. During terminal differentiation, much more TGase 1 protein is expressed than is present in proliferating basal cells. Most of this remains as the full-length inactive membrane-bound zymogen form, but up to one-half of it may be proteolytically processed while still anchored to the membranes into the highly active 67/33/10 kDa form, in this way providing the bulk of the TGase 1 enzyme activity in differentiating keratinocytes (11Steinert P.M.

Commun. 1996; 221: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). transglutaminase normal human epidermal keratinocyte fast protein liquid chromatography high pressure liquid chromatography. Earlier studies have shown that the enzyme is acylated by palmitate, and to a lesser extent by myristate, at a cluster of five cysteine residues located on the amino-terminal extension peptide, which is unique to the TGase 1 enzyme. The lipid adducts were thought to be most likely attached by thiol-ester bonds since they could be efficiently cleaved by concentrated NH2OH-HCl (17Chakravarty R. Rice R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 625-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational analyses of these cysteines showed that several are involved in attachment of the enzyme to membranes (18Phillips M.A. Qin Q. Mehrpouyan M. Rice R.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11057-11063Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, recombinant experiments showed that when this cysteine cluster motif is added to another protein, involucrin, it becomes attached to membranes. Thus, these thio-ester linkages adequately explain how TGase 1 is anchored to membranes (17Chakravarty R. Rice R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 625-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Phillips M.A. Qin Q. Mehrpouyan M. Rice R.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11057-11063Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the roles of these different lipid adducts remain unknown. In this report, we have explored the mechanism by which enzyme activity is partitioned between the cellular membrane and cytosol compartments during proliferation and differentiation by way of the lipid acyl adducts. We show here that all membrane-bound or cytosolic forms of intact TGase 1 are constitutively labeled by an N-acyl myristate linkage on glycine residue 3. We show that in proliferating and differentiating cells, the TGase 1 is differentially S-myristoylated or S-palmitoylated, respectively, which seem to confer differing degrees of attachment. Since these adducts have different half-lives, the differential labeling affords a variable mechanism for partitioning and cycling TGase 1 on or off membranes. Normal human epidermal foreskin keratinocytes (NHEK cells) (Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA) were grown as before in either 6- or 15-cm collagen-coated dishes in low or high Ca2+ KGM medium (10Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18026-18035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells were metabolically labeled (1 μCi each/ml of medium) with mixtures of [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine (DuPont NEN, ~700 Ci/mmol) or [1-14C]palmitate, [1-14C]myristate (DuPont NEN, ~650 Ci/mol), 50 μCi/ml with 9,10-3H-palmitic acid (35.9 Ci/mmol), or 9,10-3H-myristic acid (11.2 Ci/mmol) (DuPont NEN). The labels were added 4 h prior to harvesting. In pulse-chase experiments, they were added for 4 h and then chased with unlabeled medium for up to 7 days (10Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18026-18035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Some cultures also contained 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide. Harvested cells were lysed in buffer containing the protease inhibitor set as before and pelleted at 10,000 × g to obtain the cytosolic and membrane fractions (10Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18026-18035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The release of membrane-bound TGase I forms was accomplished by using either 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min or 1 M NH2OH-HCl for 1 h (11Steinert P.M. Chung S.-I. Kim S.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In some experiments, 0.4 M NH2OH-HCl was used for up to 8 h. The supernatant fractions were used directly for either immunoprecipitation with the TGase 1 polyclonal antibody or Mono Q FPLC chromatography (10Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitation pellets were redissolved in SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved on 10-20% gradient or 15% linear SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (10Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18026-18035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), dried, and visualized after 3-15 days of autoradiography. In the case of the 3H- or 14C-labeled proteins, gels were soaked in Enlightening (DuPont NEN) for fluorography. Selected bands were quantitated in a computing densitometer with ImageQuant software version 3.0 (Molecular Dynamics). Assays for TGase 1 activities were done as before (10Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I.

Samples of immunoprecipitated proteins from column fractions were hydrolyzed in 50 μl of 5.7 N HCl at 106°C in vacuo for 2-22 h, cooled, and extracted with 100 μl of CHCl3. Control experiments showed that >99% of the labeled lipids were extracted into the CHCl3 phase. The CHCl3 was evaporated in a stream of N2. The residue was redissolved in 3 μl of isopropyl alcohol, spotted onto C18 reverse-phase thin layer chromatography plates (Aldrich), developed in a solvent of methanol:water:acetic acid (89:11:0.2, v/v/vol), and autoradiographed for 6 days (21Stoffel W. Bierwirth E. Angewandte Chemie. 1962; 74: 905-907Crossref Google Scholar). Peaks of TGase 1 proteins from FPLC columns that had been labeled with [35S]cysteine and either [3H]myristate or [3H]palmitate were digested with trypsin (1% by weight) (Sigma, sequencing grade) for 3 h at 37°C, followed by proteinase K (0.5% by weight) (Promega) for 1 h at 37°C. The peptides were resolved by HPLC on a Phenomenex 2 × 250-mm C4 column at a flow rate of 0.22 ml/min using a gradient of 20-100% acetonitrile containing 0.08% trifluoroacetate collected into 0.5-min fractions, of which one-half was used for measurement of radioactivity. A portion of desired peaks was used for amino acid analysis (9Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The remainder, corresponding to 10-50 pmol, was used for mass spectroscopy, using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization method (Bio Synthesis Corp.). These were done essentially as described (22Merdes A.M. Brunkener H. Horstmann H. Georgatos D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 pmol (quantitated by amino acid analysis) of unlabeled 10-kDa TGase 1 fragments were dot-blotted onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell; pore size, 0.45 μm), and washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, 1 mM dithiolthreitol, 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and the protease inhibitor set (20Kim S.-Y. Kim I-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dried dots were overlayered with 20-50-pmol amounts of 35S-labeled intact TGase 1 protein or fragment forms, reacted for 2 h at 4°C, washed with the same buffer, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. We have shown previously (11Steinert P.M. Chung S.-I. Kim S.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that membrane-bound TGase 1 antigens can be solubilized from the membrane fraction of cultured NHEK cells in one of two ways: incubation with 0.1% Triton X-100 within 15 min at 4°C; or with 1 M NH2OH-HCl within 1-2 h at 23°C. The former method dissolves membranes, leaving the lipid adducts attached to proteins; the latter method hydrolyses the thio-ester bond by which the lipids are attached (17Chakravarty R. Rice R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 625-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev.

In this study, low (Fig. 1, A and B) or high (Fig. 1, C and D) Ca2+ cultures of NHEK cells were labeled with either [1-14C]myristic acid (Fig. 1, A and C) or [1-14C]palmitic acid (Fig. 1, B and D) for 4 h at various days of culturing and resolved into cytosolic and membrane fractions. The latter were solubilized with either Triton X-100 or 1 M NH2OH-HCl and immunoprecipitated with the specific TGase 1 polyclonal antibody; then the products were resolved on gradient gels, which were developed by fluorography. In all cases where labeling occurred, only the 106- and 10-kDa TGase 1 species were labeled, which confirms that the lipids were attached to the 10-kDa portion of the TGase 1 protein (17Chakravarty R.

Comparisons between Triton- and NH2OH-HCl-solubilized membranes from low Ca2+ cultures (Fig. 1A) showed that the former was reproducibly two times more labeled than the latter, suggesting that about ~65% of the adduct was attached through a thio-ester linkage and ~35% was not. In high Ca2+ cultures, the Triton-X-100- and NH2OH-HCl-solubilized membrane fractions were approximately equally labeled with myristate (Fig. 1C), which means that only a small amount of the label was attached through a thio-ester linkage and most was not. In high Ca2+ cultures, the membrane-bound TGase 1 fraction was labeled with [14C]palmitate, and since >98% could be removed by NH2OH-HCl (Fig. 1D), the linkage was most likely through thio-ester bonds. The cytosolic TGase 1 forms in myristate-labeled cultures were much less labeled than the membrane-bound TGase 1 fractions (Fig. 1, A and C). This myristate label was refractory to NH2OH-HCl treatment (data not shown), and thus most was not due to thio esterification. Based on comparisons of 35S-labeling in parallel cultures, we estimate the stoichiometry of myristate label on the cytosolic 106-kDa TGase 1 was ≤0.1 mol/mol. The cytosolic fractions were not labeled by palmitate (Fig. 1, B and D). These observations were confirmed by Mono Q FPLC chromatography of membrane-bound TGase 1 antigens immunoprecipitated from 5-day high Ca2+ cultures. In this case, when Triton X-100 was used for release, two peaks were labeled with [1-14C]myristate (Fig. 2A) or [1-14C]palmitate (Fig. 2C). By [35S]cysteine labeling in separate parallel experiments, these contained the 106-kDa and 67/33/10-kDa complex forms (11Steinert P.M. Chung S.-I. Kim S.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), of which only the 106- and 10-kDa bands were labeled with the 14C-lipids. When NH2OH-HCl was used to release the TGase 1 antigens, two shifted peaks of TGase 1 antigens were labeled with myristate, which contained the 106- and 67/33/10-kDa complexes, of which only the 106- and 10-kDa species were labeled (Fig. 2B). However, only trace amounts of palmitate label were retained on these proteins following treatment with NH2OH-HCl (Fig. 2D). The labeling by myristate and palmitate was confirmed by reverse-phase thin layer chromatography of the FPLC peaks following hydrolysis in 5.7 N HCl for 2 h and extraction into CHCl3 (data not shown). We also noted that ~3% of the myristate label migrated in the position of palmitate, presumably due to metabolic elongation during the 4-h incubation of the NHEK cells. The above data suggest that a hitherto unrecognized portion of the myristate label was attached through non-thio-ester bonds. We have shown previously that the amino terminus of the 106- and 10-kDa fragments of TGase 1 are blocked but could be freed after 2 h hydrolysis in 5.7 N HCl, exposing residue 3 glycine (10Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18026-18035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 11Steinert P.M. Chung S.-I. Kim S.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, one possibility is that the amino terminus of the TGase 1 protein is labeled by N-acyl myristate, as has been found for the subplasma membrane protein band 4.2 (25Risinger M.A. Dotimas E.M. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5680-5685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures of NHEK cells grown for 5 days in high Ca2+ medium were pulsed for 4 h with either [35S]cysteine/methionine, [1-14C]myristate, or [1-14C]palmitate in the absence or presence of cycloheximide. TGase 1 antigens were immunoprecipitated from the cytosolic and membrane fractions following treatment with either Triton X-100 or NH2OH-HCl. In the cytosolic fraction, only the 106-kDa form was labeled with myristate, which was resistant to release with NH2OH-HCl (Fig. 3; compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 9 and 10). Only traces of palmitate label were present in the cytosolic TGase 1 antigens (Fig. 3, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 11 and 12). In the membrane-bound fractions, the 106- and 10-kDa bands were labeled with myristate, of which about 50% was resistant to release by NH2OH-HCl (Fig. 3, compare lanes 15 and 16 with lanes 21 and 22). In addition, both [35S]cysteine and [3H]myristate labeling of TGase 1 antigens was greatly reduced in the presence of cycloheximide, which suggests that myristate labeling occurs cotranslationally with protein synthesis. However, in high Ca2+ cultures, significant labeling by palmitate still occurred in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 3, compare lane 17 with lane 18), all of which was removed by NH2OH-HCl (Fig. 3, lanes 23 and 24), suggesting that some S-palmitoylation may occur independently of protein synthesis. We next examined the nature of the lipid adducts on the amino terminus and membrane-anchorage cysteine cluster on the TGase 1 protein. The 106- and 67/33/10-kDa forms were recovered by FPLC from cultured NHEK cells labeled with [35S]cysteine and either [9,10-3H]myristate or [9,10-3H]palmitate. Each sample was then digested to completion with trypsin and proteinase K, and the peptides were resolved by HPLC on a C4 column. Under the conditions used, free cysteine-labeled peptides from throughout the protein should not be retarded, but peptides containing lipid adducts should be significantly retarded. This procedure should release from TGase 1 retarded peptide species containing the cysteine cluster (CCGCCSCR, residues 46-53) with attached myristate or palmitate. Another retarded species containing the amino terminus (GPR, from residue 3) should be found if it is N-myristoylated. Each of these peaks should be separable from the free lipids. In 5-day high Ca2+ palmitate-labeled cultures, 35S and 3H labels were present in resolved peaks at fractions 45 (major), 80, and 110 with Triton X-100 extraction (Fig. 4A). Following treatment with NH2OH-HCl, the [3H]palmitate label shifted to fraction 60, coeluting with free palmitic acid. There was a concomitant increase in the size of a non-retarded 35S-labeled peptide peak at the void volume of the HPLC column (Fig. 4B). These data are expected for hydrolysis of [S]palmitate to the free peptide and palmitic acid. In 5-day high Ca2+ myristate-labeled cultures, a major 3H-labeled peak eluted at fraction 50 with Triton X-100 (Fig. 4C), which was resistant to change by NH2OH-HCl (Fig. 4D). This is consistent with the N-acylated amino-terminal tripeptide. Other double-labeled peaks were obtained at fractions 45, 80, and 110, which on treatment with NH2OH-HCl, shifted to fraction 60 and co-eluted with free palmitic acid. As described above, these double-labeled peaks were most probably due to the elongation during culture of some myristate label to palmitate, which was then used for thio esterification. In confluent cultures grown in high Ca2+ for only 1 day, the profiles were somewhat more complicated. With palmitate labeling, in addition to a major peak at fraction 45, minor double-labeled peaks were found at fractions 80 and 110, as well as 38, 66, and 80 (Fig. 4E). On treatment with NH2OH-HCl, these shifted to major peaks at fractions 60 and 53, coeluting with free palmitic and myristic acids, respectively (Fig. 4F). Similar observations in converse were seen with myristate labeling in 1-day cultures; minor double-labeled peaks were found at fractions 38, 45, 66, 80, 95, and 110 (Fig. 4G), which shifted to peaks coeluting with palmitic and myristic acids on treatment with NH2OH-HCl (Fig. 4H). In addition, in this case, the peak at fraction 50 was unchanged. These data are consistent with the concept that in cultures recently shifted to high Ca2+ media, the TGase 1 newly expressed in the differentiating conditions was modified by palmitate instead of myristate. Likewise, stationary confluent NHEK cells maintained in low Ca2+ for 6 days contained both myristate and palmitate peaks (Fig. 4, I and J), perhaps because some cells “escaped” to begin terminal differentiation in these conditions (26Poumay Y. Pittelkow M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and some myristate had been elongated to palmitate. The chemical nature of the peaks eluted in fractions 45, 80, and 110 (palmitate labeled), and 38, 50, 66, and 94 (myristate labeled) from the C4 HPLC was determined. Following a 2-h acid hydrolysis, peak 50 was confirmed by sequencing to contain the tripeptide Gly-Pro-Arg, and thus it corresponds to residues 3-5 near the amino terminus of TGase 1. The amino acid compositions of peaks 38, 45, 66, 80, 94, and 110 were identical and contained Cys5, Gly, Ser, and Arg, consistent with the cysteine-rich anchorage peptide of residues 46-53 of TGase 1. However, this could not be confirmed by direct sequencing because the phenythiohydantoin derivative of Cys is destroyed during the sequencing reactions. Therefore, mass spectroscopic analyses were performed on 10-50-pmol aliquots of each of the retarded peaks. The material of fraction 50 of Fig. 4D had a mass of 539.4, was unchanged on treatment with NH2OH-HCl, but was reduced to 328.3 after acid hydrolysis (Fig. 5A). These data correspond well to calculated values of 539.8 for N-myristoylated-Gly-Pro-Arg, and of Gly-Pro-Arg, respectively. However, the expected mass species at 228.4, corresponding to free myristic acid, was below the level of detection of the assay. Peaks 38, 66 (Fig. 5B), and 94 had masses of 1045.1, 1255.3, and 1465.6, all of which were reduced to 833.5-834.1 on treatment with NH2OH-HCl. These coincide very closely to species containing one, two, or three myristates attached to the cysteine cluster peptide Cys-Cys-Gly-Cys-Cys-Ser-Arg of mass 834.0. Similarly, peaks 45, 80 (Fig. 5C), and 110 had masses of 1072.1, 1311.9, and 1548.8, which were reduced to 833.9-834.3 on treatment with NH2OH-HCl. These are consistent with species containing one, two, or three palmitates attached to the cysteine cluster peptide. Together, these data show that up to three lipid molecules are attached to the cysteine cluster peptide, although the predominant stoichiometry was two for myristate and one for palmitate. The exact cysteine residues acylated could not be determined. The above data have shown that in proliferating or stationary NHEK cells grown in low Ca2+ medium, the membrane-bound forms of TGase 1 possess one N-myristoyl and two S-myristoyl adducts. In terminally differentiating cells grown in high Ca2+ media for up to 5 days, the larger amounts of TGase 1 protein present possess the one N-myristoyl but predominantly only one S-palmitoyl adduct. We then tested whether these differences affect attachment to membranes. Membrane-bound TGase 1 antigens present in 6-day low Ca2+ cultures or in 5-day high Ca2+ cultures could be released by 1 M NH2OH-HCl (Fig. 6), as described previously (11Steinert P.M. Chung S.-I.

However, using 0.4 M NH2OH-HCl instead, we found that release of TGase 1 antigens from membranes of low Ca2+ cultures required 5-6 h, which was reproducibly much longer than the 2-3 h required for release from membranes of high Ca2+ (Fig. 6). We showed previously (10Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18026-18035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) that the soluble 106-, 67-, and 33-kDa forms from high Ca2+ cultures have half-lives in cultured NHEK cells of about 20, 7, and 6-7 h, respectively. Similar experiments were done on the membrane-bound TGase 1 proteins from 1-4- and 3-7-day low Ca2+ cultures, or 1-4- and 2-5-day high Ca2+ cultures (Fig. 7). The soluble 106-, 67-, and 33-kDa TGase 1 forms from both low and high Ca2+ cultures had the same half-lives as measured before (10Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18026-18035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In early (1-4-day) low Ca2+ cultures, the half-life of the 106-kDa form was ~40 h, but in 3-7-day cultures, the line was not linear, with slopes varying between 30-40 h (Fig. 7A). In 1-4-day"
https://openalex.org/W2137238554,"The growth-promoting effects of gastrin on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the gastrin/CCKB receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the downstream signaling pathways activated by gastrin are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that gastrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the major cytoplasmic substrate of the insulin receptor. The gastrin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and transient, occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter. IRS-1 binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Following gastrin stimulation, we observed a time- and dose-dependent association of IRS-1 with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from gastrin-treated cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which leads to the rapid recruitment of p85, might be one mechanism used by gastrin to activate PI 3-kinase. We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with the Grb2-Sos complex may contribute to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by gastrin. We report here that Grb2 also interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in response to gastrin.

https://openalex.org/W1969494970,"AP-1 has been shown to behave as a redox-sensitive transcription factor that can be activated by both oxidant and antioxidant stimuli. However, the mechanisms involved in the activation of AP-1 by antioxidants are largely unknown. In this study we show that the structurally unrelated antioxidant agents pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), butylated hydroxyanisole, and Nacetylcysteine activated JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase) in Jurkat T cells. This activation differed substantially from that mediated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and Ca2+ ionophore or produced by costimulation with antibodies against the T cell receptor-CD3 complex and to CD28. The activation of JNK by classical T cell stimuli was transient, whereas that mediated by PDTC and butylated hydroxyanisole (but not N-acetylcysteine) was sustained. The kinetics of JNK activation correlated with the expression of c-jun which was transient after stimulation with PMA plus ionophore and prolonged in response to PDTC, which also transiently induced c-fos. In addition, JNK activation by PMA plus ionophore was sensitive to inhibitors of signaling pathways involving Ca2+, protein kinase C, and tyrosine phosphorylation, which failed to inhibit the activation mediated by PDTC. Transfection of trans-dominant negative expression vectors of ras and raf, together with AP-1-dependent reporter constructs, as well as Western blot analysis using anti-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) antibodies, indicated that the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway did not appear to mediate the effect of the antioxidant. However, the combined treatment with PDTC and PMA, two agents that synergize on AP-1 activation, resulted in the persistent phosphorylation of ERK-2. In conclusion, our results identify JNK as a target of antioxidant agents which can be regulated differentially under oxidant and antioxidant conditions.

The capacity of AP-1 to respond to a wide array of extracellular signals is largely mediated by the transcription factors that regulate the c-fos and c-jun promoters whose binding and activity are in turn regulated through different signaling pathways (2Karin M.

Therefore, JNK activation itself could account for AP-1 activation, since TCF/Elk-1, c-Jun, and ATF-2, factors critically involved in the transcription of c-fos and c-jun, are targets that can be phosphorylated by this kinase. The activity of the AP-1 and NFκB transcription factors is regulated differentially in T lymphocytes in response to changes in the cell redox state (20Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 735-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The use of antioxidants with radical scavenger properties has evidenced a role for reactive oxygen intermediates, generated under prooxidant conditions, on the activation of NFκB. Thus, the activation of NFκB in response to oxidative stress is inhibited by several structurally unrelated antioxidants including dithiocarbamates (21Staal F.J.T. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A.

AP-1 is also activated by a number of stimuli that generate oxidative stress (23Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A.

However, these antioxidants that block NFκB activation efficiently paradoxically stimulate the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of AP-1 involving induction of the c-fos and c-jun mRNAs (23Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 24Schenk H. Matthias K. Erdbrügger W. Dröge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Therefore, signals triggered under both prooxidant and antioxidant conditions can lead to the activation of AP-1. To understand the mechanisms by which antioxidants activate AP-1, we analyzed their effects on different signal transduction pathways involved in T cell activation. We found that different antioxidant agents stimulate JNK activity. Furthermore, we studied the antioxidant-induced signaling in T lymphocytes using pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a potent antioxidant agent that activates AP-1. Our results are discussed in the context of recent works that implicate JNK as a mediator in the activation of both c-fos and c-jun transcriptional expression. The human Jurkat T cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 with GLUTAMAX-I (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), PDTC, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), N-acetylcysteine, and the calcium ionophore A23187 were purchased from Sigma. Cyclosporin A was from Sandoz. Bisindolylmaleimide and herbimycin A were from Calbiochem. The purified activating anti-CD28.2 monoclonal antibody was provided by Dr. D. Olive, and the anti-CD3 SPV-T3 has been described previously (33Spits H. Yssel H. Leeuwenberg J. De Vries J.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1985; 15: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were incubated with PDTC, PMA plus ionophore, or pretreated with PDTC and then exposed to PMA plus ionophore. After various time points, cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated using the Ultraspec system (Biotox Laboratories, Inc.). For dot-blot analysis, RNA from each sample (10 μg) was denatured and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes in a Bio-Dot SF microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad). For Northern blot analysis denatured RNA (20 μg) was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After UV cross-linking, the filters were hybridized with the corresponding specific probes: a 0.8-kb BglII-NcoI fragment of c-fos cDNA, a 0.8-kb HindIII-PstI fragment of c-jun cDNA, a 1.8-kb EcoRI fragment of human PAC-1 cDNA (34Rohan P.J. Davis P. Moskaluk C.A. Kearns M. Krutzsch H. Siebenlist U. Kelly K. Science. 1993; 259: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and a 0.6-kb HindIII-BamHI fragment of β-actin cDNA. The plasmids used for the expression of activated v-Ha-ras, dominant negative ras, and dominant negative raf were provided by Dr. D. Cantrell. These plasmids were generated by inserting a 0.7-kb BamHI fragment of v-Ha-ras (activated ras), a 4.4-kb XhoI-BamHI fragment of c-Ha-ras N17 (ras dominant negative), and a 0.8-kb polymerase chain reaction fragment containing a carboxyl-terminal truncated form of raf (dominant negative) into the pEFBOS expression vector (35Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). The IL-2Luc reporter construct containing the −326 to +45 human IL-2 promoter/enhancer region fused to the luciferase gene (36Durand D.B. Shaw J.-P. Bush M.R. Replogle R.E. Belagaje R. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. G. Crabtree. The 73colLuc and 60colLuc plasmids including the AP-1-responsive (−73/+63 base pairs) and the AP-1-unresponsive (−60/+63 base pairs) regions of the human collagenase promoter fused to the luciferase gene have been described previously (37Deng T. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and were provided by Dr. M. Karin. Small scale nuclear extracts were obtained from 107 Jurkat cells following a procedure described previously (38Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar) but included in the extracting buffers 10 mM sodium orthomolybdate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. EMSAs were performed as described (32Aragonés J. López-Rodriguez C. Corbí A. Gómez del Arco P. LópezCabrera M. de Landá;zuri M.O. Redondo J.M. J. Biol.

The double-stranded oligonucleotide used as a probe in EMSAs, 5′-GCCCCCTCTGACTCATGCTGACA-3′, included the −68 to −46 base pairs of the CD11c promoter (32Aragonés J. López-Rodriguez C. Corbí A.

Jurkat cells (107) were transfected with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, exponentially growing cells (3-7 × 105/ml) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and incubated for 12 h at 37°C with a mixture of 5 μg/ml plasmid DNA and 10 μg/ml Lipofectin in 1 ml of Opti-MEM. Then, cells were diluted with 14 ml of complete medium (RPMI and 10% fetal bovine serum) and incubated for 36 h. Cells were then treated with different stimuli for 12 additional h, collected by centrifugation, and luciferase activity was determined following instructions described in a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). In cotransfection experiments with expression vectors, the same protocol was followed, but the reporter and expression plasmids were added at concentrations of 5 and 10 μg/ml, respectively, and the Lipofectin to 10 μg/ml. Western blot was performed as described previously (39Lisbona C. Alemany S. Calvo V. Ferná;ndez-Renart M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2746-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells (106) were washed and lysed in 200 μl of buffer A (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 50 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 nM okadaic acid). After vortex, cells were kept on ice for 15 min and microcentrifuged for 15 min. Supernatants were collected, mixed with loading buffer, and separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and then incubated with blocking solution (5% w/v skim milk TBS-T (TBS, 0.05% Tween 20)) for 60 min at 45°C, washed three times in TBS-T, and incubated with anti-ERK 1, 2 (Zymed, San Francisco) 0.1% v/v in TBS-T, 5% w/v skim milk. Then, membranes were washed six times for 5 min each in 0.5% w/v skim milk in TBS-T, and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (ICN) (0.1% v/v in TBS-T) was incubated for 60 min at room temperature. After three washes with TBS-T and one with TBS, membrane-bound antibody was visualized by ECL detection reagent (Amersham Corp.). In-gel kinase assays were performed as described previously (40Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Lysates from 106 cells were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer and separated by electrophoresis in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel polymerized in the presence of GST-c-Jun1-79 fusion protein. GST-c-Jun protein was isolated from 250 ml of bacterial cells expressing pGEX-c-Jun1-79 plasmid (provided by Dr. R. Davis) using GSH-Shepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice for 15 min in 100 ml of 20% v/v 2-propanol, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, and then equilibrated with two 15-min changes of 100 ml of buffer A (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were denatured by incubating the gel twice for 15 min in 100 ml of 6 M urea in buffer A at room temperature. This was followed by four sequential renaturation steps (15 min each) by discarding half of the volume (50 ml) and replacing it with ice-cold renaturation buffer (0.05% v/v Tween 20 in buffer A) at 4°C. After washing three or four times with 150 ml of renaturation buffer at 4°C, the gel was immersed in 25 ml of kinase buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mM MgCl2, 5 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, 2 mM dithiothreitol) for 30 min at 4°C and incubated further in 15 ml of kinase buffer containing 20 μM ATP and 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30°C for 1-2 h. Finally, the gel was washed four times with 150-200 ml of 5% v/v trichloroacetic acid and 1% v/v sodium pyrophosphate at room temperature, dried, and exposed for 1-2 days. Since different antioxidant agents, including PDTC, activate AP-1, we analyzed further the effect of PDTC on c-fos and c-jun mRNA steady state. Kinetic experiments using total RNA from Jurkat cells treated with PDTC and from cells treated with the combination of the phorbol ester PMA and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, either pretreated or not with PDTC, were carried out (Fig. 1A). Incubation with PMA plus A23187 resulted in transient induction of both c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels, having maximal values at 30-60 min, whereas exposure to PDTC caused a prolonged expression of c-jun mRNA reaching maximal levels between 1 and 4 h and remained high for at least 10 h. PDTC induced a weaker expression of c-fos mRNA although displaying kinetics different from that exerted by the combination of PMA and ionophore. Strikingly, the incubation of Jurkat cells with PDTC prior to stimulation with PMA plus ionophore led to a prolonged induction not only of the c-jun mRNA levels, but also of the c-fos levels, which were, on the other hand, higher than those obtained with PDTC and PMA-ionophore separately. As shown previously for other cell types (23Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 24Schenk H. Matthias K. Erdbrügger W. Dröge W.

Taken together these data indicated that in Jurkat T cells, PDTC is able, by itself, to induce a transient expression of c-fos, a strong and prolonged expression of c-jun, and a durable activation of both c-fos and c-jun triggered by PMA plus ionophore.Fig. 2Roles of Ras and Raf on the AP-1 trans-activation mediated by PDTC. Jurkat T cells were cotransfected by lipofection with 5 μg/ml luciferase-based plasmids directed by the AP-1-responsive (−73/+63 base pairs) sequence of the collagenase promoter (−73colLuc) (panels A and B) or by the IL-2 promoter (IL-2Luc) (panels C and D) together with 10 μg/ml expression vectors of the trans-dominant negative forms of ras (panels A and C) and raf (panels B and D) or its parental empty vector, pEFBOS, for 12 h. 36 h post-transfection cells were treated with 50 μM PDTC or 20 ng/ml PMA plus 1 μM A23187 for an additional 12 h. The results are expressed as relative light units (R.L.U) measured for 30 s. Results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Ras/ERK pathway is a common route that serves multiple extracellular signals that activate the SRE of the c-fos promoter (4Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar, 5Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar). Since the SRE has been shown to act as a primary antioxidant responsive element that can be activated by PDTC (23Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether the activation of AP-1 by this antioxidant was mediated through activation of this pathway in Jurkat T cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, the activation of an AP-1 reporter construct (−73colLuc) in response to PDTC was not affected by the expression of a dominant negative ras, c-Ha-ras N17 (Fig. 2A). The efficient expression of the ras construct was confirmed in parallel cotransfections, where expression of c-Ha-ras N17 caused a severe transcriptional inhibition of both a luciferase plasmid directed by the human IL-2 promoter (Fig. 2C) and the AP-1 reporter plasmid in response to PMA plus ionophore (data not shown). Similar experiments were performed to analyze whether Raf-1 kinase was required for the activation of AP-1 induced by PDTC. AP-1 trans-activation by the antioxidant was not significantly affected by the expression of a trans-dominant negative mutant of Raf-1 kinase (Fig. 2B) which efficiently inhibited the IL-2Luc trans-activation, as well as the AP-1Luc trans-activation by PMA plus ionophore (Fig. 2D and data not shown). To explore whether the signals elicited by PDTC affected ERK activity, we performed Western blot analysis using anti-Erk-1, −2 antibodies to detect any possible decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of ERKs which would be indicative of its activation (41Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). PDTC failed to modify the mobility of ERK-2, which appears to be the predominant ERK isoform expressed by Jurkat cells (Fig. 3A). As expected, PMA caused a very rapid transient shift in the mobility of ERK-2 which was detected as early as 30 s and declined after 1 h of treatment (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, when Jurkat cells were pretreated with PDTC and stimulated further with PMA, ERK-2 persisted in its activated form after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 3A). The persistent phosphorylation of ERK-2 observed might be due to an inhibition of the PAC-1 T cell phosphatase, which has been shown to dephosphorylate ERK-2 in vivo (34Rohan P.J. Davis P. Moskaluk C.A. Kearns M. Krutzsch H. Siebenlist U. Kelly K. Science. 1993; 259: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 42Ward Y. Gupta S. Jensen P. Wartmann M. Davis R.J. Kelly K. Nature. 1994; 367: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, Northern blot analysis indicated that mRNA steady-state levels of PAC-1, induced early by PMA, were not significantly affected by previous treatment with PDTC after 90 and 180 min (Fig. 3B) when a complete activation of ERK-2 was found in cotreated cells (Fig. 3A). Taken together, our results indicated that the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway did not appear to mediate the effect of the antioxidant PDTC. In addition, the combined treatment of PDTC and PMA, which has been shown to synergize on AP-1-dependent trans-activation (23Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 24Schenk H. Matthias K. Erdbrügger W. Dröge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) caused a persistent phosphorylation of ERK-2 by mechanisms different from the inhibition of the gene expression of PAC-1. Signals leading to T cell activation by costimulation with phorbol ester and Ca2+ ionophore or by agonistic antibodies to the T cell receptor-CD3 complex and to CD28 involve the activation of JNKs (43Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Besides the ability to phosphorylate c-Jun (40Hibi M. Lin A.

PPZ1 is also important for cell integrity, as ppz1Δ cells undergo lysis under caffeine stress and PPZ1 overexpression overrides the lytic defect of mutants in the protein kinase C/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. The PPZ1 protein can be dissected in two halves. The COOH-terminal half is related to type 1 phosphatases, whereas the NH2-terminal half is unrelated to phosphatases and contains a consensus site for N-myristoylation. Several mutated versions of PPZ1 have been constructed and tested for complementation of ppz1Δ mutants. We show that PPZ1 can be myristoylated in vivo and that change of Gly-2 to Ala results in lack of myristoylation and loss of complementation of salt tolerance. Removal of the entire NH2-terminal half results in complete loss of function, although it does not abolish the phosphatase activity of the protein expressed in Escherichia coli. The deletion of a large region of the NH2-terminal half (residues 17-193) does not affect the ability to complement the salt tolerance phenotype but abolish complementation of caffeine sensitivity, whereas the opposite behavior is observed upon removal of residues from 241 to 318. Mutation of Arg-451 to Leu results in both complete loss of function and of phosphatase activity.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 3Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), yeast cells contain a number of novel phosphatases. A most interesting example of these novel forms are the proteins encoded by genes PPZ1 and PPZ2. The gene PPZ1 was cloned a few years ago in our laboratory (4Posas F. Casamayor A. Morral N. Ariño J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11734-11740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and encodes a 692-residue protein that can be dissected in two halves. Its COOH-terminal half shows a remarkable similarity in sequence (61%) and size (about 350 residues) with the catalytic subunit of type 1 phosphatase (PP-1) from different organisms, whereas the NH2-terminal region is completely unrelated to other phosphatase sequences and is characterized by a large number of Ser and Thr residues, as well as of basic amino acids. The NH2-terminal region of PPZ1 also contains a consensus sequence for N-myristoylation. This is a remarkable feature since, in yeast, only a very limited number of proteins are known to be myristoylated in vivo (for review, see 5Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll LJ. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Interestingly enough, another Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B) can also be myristoylated in vivo and this modification affects its regulatory subunit, encoded by the gene CNB1 (6Cyert M.S. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3460-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed PPZ1 has been characterized in our laboratory and found to display Ser/Thr protein phosphatase activity toward several substrates. Although in some aspects the activity of recombinant PPZ1 resembles that of PP-1, a number of differences (e.g. inability to dephosphorylate glycogen phosphorylase) were also observed (7Posas F. Bollen M. Stalmans W. Ariño J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The gene PPZ2 (8Hughes V. Müller A. Stark M.J.R. Cohen P.T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Lee K.S. Hines L.K. Levin D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5843-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) codes for a 710-residue polypeptide that can also be considered as composed of two halves. The COOH-terminal one is very similar to the COOH-terminal half of PPZ1 (93%), whereas the NH2-terminal halves of PPZ1 and PPZ2 are more divergent from each other (43% of identity). Despite this higher divergence, the NH2-terminal half of PPZ2 is also rich in Ser and Thr residues and, as in PPZ1, contains a consensus sequence for N-myristoylation. Strains lacking both PPZ1 and PPZ2 are prone to cell lysis under certain stress situations, such as exposure to caffeine (10Posas F. Casamayor A. Ariño J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or high temperature (9Lee K.S. Hines L.K. Levin D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5843-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and the lytic phenotype can be rescued by addition of 1 M sorbitol to the medium as osmotic cushion. The contribution of each gene product to this phenotype is different, the lack of PPZ1 being responsible for more dramatic changes. The lytic phenotype is also found in mutants in the protein kinase C/MAP 1The abbreviations used are: MAPmitogen-activated proteinkbpkilobase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. kinase pathway (9Lee K.S. Hines L.K. Levin D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5843-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), involved in the proper construction of the yeast cell wall, and there is evidence that the PPZ phosphatases are somehow related to this pathway, since the deletion of PPZ1/PPZ2 is additive to the deletion of the MAP kinase gene, and this can be complemented by high copy number expression of both phosphatase genes (9Lee K.S. Hines L.K. Levin D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5843-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). mitogen-activated protein kilobase pair(s) polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Recently, our laboratory demonstrated that the PPZ phosphatases are also involved in salt homeostasis (11Posas F. Camps M. Ariño J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13036-13041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Lack of PPZ1 (but not of PPZ2) results in increased tolerance to sodium and lithium cations. An additional increase is observed when PPZ2 is disrupted in a ppz1Δ background. These mutants display an increased output of sodium and lithium, as a result of an increase in the mRNA levels of the ENA1/PMR2A gene (11Posas F. Camps M. Ariño J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13036-13041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), encoding a P-type ATPase that is believed to be the major pump responsible for sodium (and lithium) efflux in yeast cells (12Garciadeblas B.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It is remarkable that calcineurin is also involved in salt homeostasis in yeast. In this case, however, lack of calcineurin results in increased salt sensitivity (15Breuder T. Hemenway C.S. Movva N.R. Cá;rdenas M.E. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4063-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that the mechanisms of action of the PPZ phosphatases and calcineurin are independent and opposite (11Posas F. Camps M. Ariño J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13036-13041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The discovery of relevant phenotypic changes associated with the absence of the PPZ phosphatases (particularly of PPZ1) and the unusual nature of the NH2-terminal half of these proteins moved us to initiate this study, aiming to gain further insight into the structure-function relationship of these phosphatases. E. coli cells (strain NM522) were grown at 37°C (unless otherwise stated) in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, when needed, for plasmid selection. Yeast cells were grown at 28°C in YPD medium or, when indicated, in SD synthetic medium (18Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods of Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Yeast strains used in this work were DL790-3A (MATαppz1::URA3 PPZ2 ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 his4 can-1r) and DL790-3D (MATa PPZ1 PPZ2 ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 his4 can-1r), derived from strain DL790 (9Lee K.S. Hines L.K. Levin D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5843-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), DBY746 (MATa PPZ1 PPZ2 ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 his3-Δ1 trp1-289) and its derivative JA-31 (ppz1::URA3 ppz2::TRP1) (11Posas F. Camps M. Ariño J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13036-13041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and YPH499 (MATa PPZ1 PPZ2 ura3-52 leu2Δ1 ade2-101 lys2-801 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ63) (19Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli cells were transformed using standard calcium chloride treatment (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed by a modification of the lithium acetate method (21Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic yeast DNA was prepared after disruption of yeast cells with glass beads as described (18Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods of Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Restriction reactions, DNA ligations and other standard recombinant DNA techniques were performed essentially as described (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar) using an automated Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer. The sensitivity of the cells to lithium chloride and caffeine was evaluated on freshly prepared SD agar plates containing different concentrations of the compound. Drop tests were performed essentially as in (11Posas F. Camps M. Ariño J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13036-13041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Growth test in liquid cultures was performed as follows. Cultures were grown in SD medium for 2 days, and 30 μl of a 1:100 dilution was inoculated into 5 ml of YPD medium. Then, cultures were grown for 19 h in the presence or absence of lithium chloride, and relative growth was determined as the value of the A660 in lithium-treated cultures in comparison with growth monitored in the same medium in the absence of salt. To generate wild type and mutated versions of PPZ1 we devised an strategy based in the construction of a PPZ1 promoter cassette and its fusion to the different versions of the PPZ1 open reading frame. The promoter cassette was constructed as follows. A DNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides −800 to −10 (the A of the initiating Met being +1) was amplified from genomic DNA using oligonucleotides P4 and P2 (Table I), that contain BamHI and SalI sites, respectively. The source of DNA was not the previously cloned PPZ1 gene (4Posas F. Casamayor A. Morral N. Ariño J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11734-11740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because the initial clone did not contain the full promoter sequence. 2J. Clotet and J. Ariño, unpublished observations. The amplification fragment, which has an internal BamHI site located at about 0.33-kbp from the 5′ end, was digested with BamHI and SalI. This generated a 456-base pair fragment that displayed full promoter activity (not shown) that was cloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of plasmid YCplac111, which carries the LEU2 marker (23Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar), yielding pYPBZ1. A wild type version of the PPZ1 open reading frame was generated by PCR using oligonucleotide C1 (which contains the initiating Met and a SalI site at the 5′ end) and oligonucleotide T1 (which corresponds to the sequence from nucleotide +2256 to +2273, that is, about 175 nucleotides downstream the stop codon, and includes a HindIII restriction site). The resulting 2.3-kbp fragment was digested with SalI and HindIII and cloned into pYPBZ1, yielding pYC1Z1.Table IOligonucleotides used in the generation of the different PPZ1 constructs described in this workNameSequenceC15′-GCGTCGACAAAATGGGTAATTCAA-3′C25′-GCGTCGACAAAATGCAATCTTCCGGGA-3′C35′-GCGTCGACAAAATGGCTAATTCAAGTTCA-3M15′-GTGATTATGTGGACCTTGGTAAACAGTCACTG-3′OV15′-CGGGATCCATGGGTAATCAAGTTCA-3′OV25′-CCGCGGCCGCTTACTGTTGAGATTCGTT-3′OV35′-CCAAGCTTATGATGCATGGATATTACTCA-3′P25′-CGCGTCGACGAAGGAAAGATAAGCAGA-3P45′-GCGGGATCCAAGATTATCAATCCGAT-3′T15′-GGGAAGCTTCAATACACACGCGAAG-3′ Open table in a new tab An open reading frame lacking the entire NH2-terminal half was also generated by standard PCR techniques using oligonucleotides C2 and T1. C2 encodes from residues 345 to 349 of PPZ1, the first triplet being a Met codon, and has a SalI restriction site at its 5′ end. The resulting open reading frame codes for 348 residues and can be easily aligned with type 1 phosphatases from different origins (4Posas F. Casamayor A. Morral N. Ariño J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11734-11740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 1.25-kbp amplification fragment was digested with SalI and HindIII and cloned into pYPBZ1 to yield pYC2Z1. Deletion of residues 241-318 of PPZ1 was accomplished by digestion of pYC1Z1 with NsiI and religating the resulting 8.7-kbp DNA fragment to generate pYC5Z1. Deletion of residues 17-193 was made as follows. The pYC1Z1 plasmid was digested with BamHI and HindIII to liberate the entire insert, and this was cloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). The construct was digested with EcoRI, and the resulting 5.3-kbp fragment was religated. The insert was recovered by digestion with BamHI and HindIII and cloned back into YCplac111 to give pYC4Z1. Change of the putative myristoylation site, Gly-2, to Ala was made as follows. A PCR reaction was performed using oligonucleotides C3 and T1. Note that C3 contains the sequence of C1, except that a C is now present instead of G (Table I). The 2.3-kbp amplification fragment was digested with SalI and HindIII and cloned into pYPBZ1, yielding pYC3Z1. To change Arg-451 to Leu, the 0.4-kbp ClaI fragment, containing the codon to be mutated was excised from the original PPZ1 clone (4Posas F. Casamayor A. Morral N. Ariño J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11734-11740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into the ClaI site of plasmid pSP72 (Promega). The oligonucleotide M1 (Table I) was employed in conjunction with the U.S.E. mutagenesis kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), based in the procedure developed by Deng and Nickoloff (24Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The 2.3-kbp SalI-HindIII fragment was excised from pYC1Z1 and cloned into pBluescript SK+. This construct was digested with ClaI, and the resulting 4.9-kbp fragment ligated with the mutated ClaI fragments. Clones with the appropriate orientation were selected, digested with SalI and HindIII, and the 2.3-kbp fragment was cloned into SalI- and HindIII-digested pYPBZ, to yield pYPC6Z1. When necessary, the above mentioned constructs (promoter plus open reading frame) were recovered by digestion with BamHI and HindIII and placed in the multicopy plasmid YEplac181 (23Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed in all cases by DNA sequencing and/or restriction mapping. The structure of the mentioned mutated forms is depicted in Fig. 1. Strain YPH499 (19Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed with different constructs based in pYES2 (Invitrogen), a high copy number plasmid containing the powerful GAL1 promoter element that is switched off when cells are grown on glucose and switched on when in galactose. To clone the wild type version of PPZ1, oligonucleotide OV1, containing the first codons of PPZ1 and a BamHI site, and oligonucleotide OV2 (Table I), corresponding to the sequence surrounding the stop codon, were used to amplify the PPZ1 open reading frame. The amplification fragment was digested with BamHI and NotI and cloned into these same sites of pYES2. An NH2-terminal truncated version of PPZ1 was created by using oligonucleotides C2 (see above) and OV2. The amplification fragment was digested with SalI and NotI and cloned into these sites of pBluescript SK+. This construct was digested with HincII and NotI, and the insert cloned into SmaI/NotI-digested pBluescript SK+. The insert was recovered by digestion with HindIII/NotI and cloned into pYES2 previously linearized with these restriction enzymes. Finally, the NH2-terminal half of PPZ1 was cloned into pYES2 as follows. Oligonucleotide OV3 (Table I) was used with oligonucleotide OV1 in PCR reactions to amplify a DNA fragment encoding from the initiating Met of PPZ1 to residue 319 (a stop codon, as well as a HindIII site, have been included in OV3). The amplification fragment was digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into plasmid pSP72 (Promega). The insert was recovered by digestion with SmaI and HindIII and cloned into pBluescript SK+, previously linearized with these same enzymes. Finally, the insert was recovered by digestion with BamHI and SalI and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pYES2. Polyclonal antibodies against PPZ1 were obtained by injection into rabbits of bacterially expressed PPZ1. Preparations of a glutathione S-transferase fused PPZ1 were purified by affinity chromatography as described previously (7Posas F. Bollen M. Stalmans W. Ariño J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and used as immunogen. Sera were collected, globulins concentrated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate, and immunoglobulins purified by chromatography on protein A-agarose columns (Boehringer Mannheim). Strain DBY746 was grown in YPD (25 ml) until an optical density of 6 was reached. Cells were collected and resuspended in 4 ml of buffer A, composed of 200 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM ethylene glycol-O,O′-bis(2-aminoethyl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Cells were disrupted by vigorous vortex in the presence of equal volume of glass beads. The mixture was centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was taken to 7 ml with the above mentioned buffer. Aliquots (0.8 ml) of the extract received 0.2 ml of either buffer, 10 M urea, 2.5 M sodium chloride, 5% Triton X-100, or 0.5 M sodium carbonate (pH 11) and were incubated at 4°C for 20 min. Samples were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4°C. Supernatants (0.95 ml) were precipitated with 66 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid. Pellets were resuspended in 0.95 ml of buffer and precipitated as described. Precipitates were washed once with diethyl ether, resuspended in SDS-loading buffer, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore) and incubated overnight with a 1/100 dilution of the anti-PPZ1 antibodies. Detection of immunoreactive proteins was carried out using 125I-protein G (Amersham Corp.) and autoradiography. Yeast cells were grown (5 ml) until an optical density of 2 was achieved. Then, 4 μl of a stock solution (5 mg/ml, prepared in ethanol) of cerulenin (Calbiochem) were added. After 15 min, 0.33 mCi of [3H]myristic acid were added and growth resumed for 75 min. Identical samples were processed in parallel, except that these did not receive the radioactive compound. Cells were collected, homogenates prepared with the aid of glass beads in 0.35 ml of lysing buffer (50 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol plus protease inhibitors), and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. Three μl of anti-PPZ1 antibodies were added to 0.2 ml of supernatants. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, 90 μl of insoluble protein A (Sigma) were added and incubation continued for 75 min. Immunocomplexes were washed four times with lysing buffer and recovered by centrifugation (800 × g for 5 min). Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-loading buffer and samples subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Tritium-labeled samples were stained and treated for fluorography. Nonradioactive immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted as described above to detect the presence of the PPZ1 protein. Plasmid pYC1Z1, pYC2Z1, and pYC3Z1 were digested with SalI and HindIII, and the inserts were cloned into plasmid pSP72. The resulting constructs were digested with BamHI and PvuII, and each insert was ligated into the BamHI and SmaI sites of plasmid pGEX-KT (26Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), yielding pGEX-KT/C1, pGEX-KT/C2, and pGEX-KT/C3, respectively. The construct containing the Arg-431 to Leu mutation was constructed as follows. pGEX-KT/C1 was digested with ClaI and ligated with the 0.4-kbp ClaI fragment of PPZ1 that contained the desired mutation (see above). Positive clones with the appropriate orientation of the ClaI fragment (pGEX-KT/C6) were selected and used in expression experiments. Expression and purification of the different forms of PPZ1 in E. coli were carried out as described previously (7Posas F. Bollen M. Stalmans W. Ariño J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Phosphatase activity was determined using 32P-labeled myelin basic protein as substrate in the presence of Mn+2 ions as described (7Posas F. Bollen M. Stalmans W. Ariño J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Since PPZ1 contains a Gly-2 residue that is located within a consensus sequence for N-myristoylation, we explored the possibility that PPZ1 could be myristoylated in vivo and, in this case, if this modification could have functional relevance. Wild type DBY746 and ppz1Δ JA-31 yeast cells were incubated with [3H]myristate and extracts prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Electrophoretic analysis of whole extracts (not shown) did not reveal any radioactive protein that could be assigned to PPZ1. However, when extracts from prelabeled wild type and ppz1Δ cells were incubated with anti-PPZ1 antibodies, incorporation of radioactivity in immunoprecipitated PPZ1 was found (Fig. 2A). Moreover, when immunoprecipitation was carried out from ppz1Δ cells harboring a construct that expressed a version of PPZ1 in which Gly-2 is mutated to Ala, we did not found radioactivity incorporated into the protein. This was indicative that PPZ1 could be myristoylated in vivo at Gly-2. Wild type, ppz1Δ and ppz1Δ cells carrying a low copy plasmid bearing the Gly → Ala version of PPZ1 expressed from the PPZ1 promoter were then challenged with different concentrations of lithium (Fig. 2, B and C). As described, at high lithium concentrations, wild type cells cannot grow while the ppz1Δ mutant survives. Expression of the wild type form of PPZ1 from plasmid pYC1Z1 fully restores salt sensitivity, demonstrating that the wild type construct perfectly complements the chromosomal gene deletion. On the contrary, mutation of Gly-2 results in near complete loss of function, without affecting the amount of PPZ1 protein present in the cell, as determined by immunoblot experiments (not shown) nor the protein phosphatase activity of the enzyme when expressed in E. coli (see below). Since the NH2-terminal half of PPZ1 is a very distinctive feature of this phosphatase, we decided to investigate whether or not this part of the protein is necessary for function. This was made by generating several constructs based in a centromeric plasmid that, in low copy number, expressed from the PPZ1 promoter different versions of the protein with modifications at the NH2 terminus. One of them, pYC4Z1, lacks a rather large segment located very close to the NH2 terminus (residues 17-193). A second construct (pYC5Z1) has a relatively short deletion near the COOH-terminal half (from residues 241-318). Both deletions closely correspond to regions that are well conserved between PPZ1 and PPZ2. Finally, in construct pYC2Z1, the complete NH2-terminal half has been deleted, and a 348-residues protein that can be aligned with the catalytic subunit of type 1 or 2A phosphatase is expressed. The ppz1Δ strain DL790-3A was transformed with the constructs and plated in medium containing different concentrations of lithium chloride (Fig. 3A). It can be observed that ppz1Δ cells harboring pYC4Z1 are quite sensitive to lithium (roughly as wild type cells are), indicating that, although large (177 residues), this deletion has no effect on PPZ1 function. Interestingly, cells harboring the pYC5Z1 construct, although not as tolerant as ppz1Δ cells, are far more resistant than wild type cells, suggesting that the 241-317 region is needed for the phosphatase to confer the normal level of salt sensitivity. Expression of the COOH-terminal half of PPZ1 does not decrease at all the salt tolerance of the ppz1Δ strain, indicating that removal of the NH2-terminal half dramatically affects this function. In Fig. 3B the relative growth in liquid culture of a ppz1Δ strain carrying the mentioned constructs is shown. These results indicate that, in addition to the myristoylatable Gly-2, the NH2-terminal half of PPZ1 contains additional regions that are important for function in salt homeostasis. The similarity of the COOH-terminal half of PPZ1 with the type 1 phosphatase, together with the fact that functionally inactive ppz1Δ mutants lacked large regions of the COOH-terminal half, made reasonable to assume that, at least in part, the biological role of PPZ1 was based on its catalytic activity as Ser/Thr protein phosphatase. We addressed this question by expressing a mutated version of PPZ1 devoid of phosphatase activity. To this end, Arg-451 (which would correspond to Arg-96 in the catalytic subunit of rabbit skeletal muscle PP-1) was changed to Leu to yield plasmids pGEX-KT/C6 and pYC6Z1. In our case, expression of the mutated form of PPZ1 in E. coli (Fig. 4) shows that the modified protein is virtually inactive as phosphatase. It is worth noting that removal of the NH2 terminus or mutation of the myristoylatable Gly-2 has a very limited effect on the phosphatase activity. As it is the case for the complete PPZ1, none of the mutated forms of PPZ1 displayed significant activity against 32P-labeled glycogen phosphorylase (not shown). When the Arg-451 to Leu mutation is expressed in yeast cells (Fig. 5, A and B), it is observed a failure to decrease the salt tolerance of a ppz1 disruption mutant, indicating that the protein is not functional in vivo. This failure was also observed when the construct was expressed from a multicopy plasmid (not shown). These results clearly confirms that the phosphatase activity of PPZ1 is essential for its f"
https://openalex.org/W2091754665,"The Runt domain is the DNA-binding domain defining a small family of transcription factors that are involved in important developmental processes. Developmental pathways controlled by Runt domain proteins include sex determination, neurogenesis, segmentation, and eye development in Drosophila and hematopoiesis in mammals. In addition to binding DNA, the Runt domain also mediates heterodimerization with another subunit called the core-binding factor β (CBFβ) subunit. In this study we overexpress the Runt domain from the mouse CBFα2 (AML1) protein in Escherichia coli, and purify it from the insoluble fraction. We determine the equilibrium constants for Runt domain binding to two different DNA sequences by surface plasmon resonance technology. Circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrates that the Runt domain is a folded β-domain with essentially no α-helical content. The single tryptophan residue in the CBFα2 Runt domain at amino acid 79 is shown by tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy to reside in a polar environment. Finally, we demonstrate that ATP can be UV cross-linked to the Runt domain and that ATP binding is sensitive to an amino acid substitution in the putative Kinase-1a motif (P-loop). The Runt domain is the DNA-binding domain defining a small family of transcription factors that are involved in important developmental processes. Developmental pathways controlled by Runt domain proteins include sex determination, neurogenesis, segmentation, and eye development in Drosophila and hematopoiesis in mammals. In addition to binding DNA, the Runt domain also mediates heterodimerization with another subunit called the core-binding factor β (CBFβ) subunit. In this study we overexpress the Runt domain from the mouse CBFα2 (AML1) protein in Escherichia coli, and purify it from the insoluble fraction.

https://openalex.org/W2004166535,"The p21-activated kinase (PAK) is a downstream target of Rac and CDC42, members of the Ras-related Rho subfamily, that mediates signaling pathway leading to cytoskeletal reorganization. To investigate its function in Caenorhabditis elegans development, we have isolated the cDNA coding for the p21-activated kinase homologue (CePAK) from a C. elegans embryonic cDNA library. This 2.35-kilobase pair cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 572 amino acid residues, with the highly conserved N-terminal p21-binding and the C-terminal kinase domains. Similar to its mammalian and Drosophila counterparts, the CePAK protein expressed in E. coli exhibits binding activity toward GTP-bound CeRac1 and CDC42Ce. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the recombinant CePAK recognize a specific 70-kDa protein from embryonic extracts that displays CeRac1/CDC42Ce-binding and kinase activities. Immunofluorescence analysis indicates that CePAK is specifically expressed at the hypodermal cell boundaries during embryonic body elongation, which involves dramatic cytoskeletal reorganization. Interestingly, CeRac1 and CDC42Ce are found at the same location, which might point to their common involvement in hypodermal cell fusion, a crucial morphogenetic event for nematode development.

The embryos of multicellular organisms undergo profound cytoskeletal reorganization following fertilization (1Sardet C. McDougall A. Houliston E. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 166-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A striking example of such morphological changes is observed in the embryogenesis of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In the second half of embryonic development, rapid cell proliferation largely ceases, whereas the length of the embryo increases by four times (2Priess J.R. Hirsh D.I. Dev. Biol. 1986; 117: 156-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Unlike plant cells (3Lloyd C.W. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1989; 1: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or insect oocytes (4Tucker J.B. Meats M. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) where elongation is achieved by limiting radial expansion of the symmetrical cell growth, C. elegans embryo maintains the same volume throughout embryonic development. Cytoskeletal reorganization is therefore essential for this developmental process. One noticeable feature during nematode embryo elongation is the shape changes of the hypodermal cells, which become elongated by fusing into each other (5Podbilewicz B. White J.G. Dev. Biol. 1994; 161: 408-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These cells contain contractile circumferentially oriented bundles of microfilaments (both actin fibers and microtubules), which are associated at the apical membranes, similar to the vertebrate adherens junctions (2Priess J.R. Hirsh D.I. Dev. Biol. 1986; 117: 156-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The body elongation is achieved by the shortening of these microfilaments as the hypodermal cells fuse. Interestingly, these microfilaments are only structurally organized during the elongation event. Key molecules involved in cytoskeletal reorganization include the Rho subfamily of p21 Ras-related proteins. In mammalian cells, Rac induces the formation of lamellipodia (6Ridley A. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3017) Google Scholar), and Rho is responsible for the formation of stress fibers (7Ridley A. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3752) Google Scholar), whereas CDC42 promotes formation of filopodia (8Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

In lower multicellular organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster, the Rho subfamily has been shown to be involved in various aspects of actin-dependent morphogenesis including dorsal closure (10Harden N. Loh H.Y. Chia W. Lim L. Development. 1995; 121: 903-914PubMed Google Scholar) and epithelial cell shape changes (11Eaton S. Auvinen P. Luo L. Jan Y.N. Simons K. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 131: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The activity of Rho p21s, like other Ras-related proteins, is modulated by different types of regulatory proteins (GTPase-activating proteins, GDP dissociation inhibitors, and guanine nucleotide exchange factors) resulting in the cycling of these p21s between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form (12Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar).

Its function as an effector is suggested not only by its ability to bind to the active GTP-bound forms of either Rac or CDC42 but more importantly by the fact that it becomes activated upon binding. p21-activated kinase glutathione S-transferase polymerase chain reaction homologue of PAK in Drosophila. To investigate the role of PAK in morphogenesis during C. elegans embryogenesis, we have isolated in this study the nematode PAK homologue (CePAK), which displays conserved biochemical activities. CePAK whose mRNA is highly expressed in embryos, is specifically localized at the hypodermal cell boundaries throughout the embryonic body elongation. Interestingly, our study also shows that both CeRac1 (23Chen W. Lim H.H. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 320-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and CDC42Ce (24Chen W. Lim H.H. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13280-13285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) colocalize with CePAK, therefore suggesting their common involvement in this crucial morphogenetic event. The Bristol N2 strain of C. elegans was grown at 20°C with Escherichia coli OP50 as a food source (23Chen W. Lim H.H. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 320-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 587Google Scholar). Worms of each developmental stage were obtained from cultures synchronized as described previously (23Chen W. Lim H.H. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 320-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Degenerate oligos (LLWN91 and 92; see Fig. 1) were designed on the basis of sequence conservation between the Drosophila DPAK (22Harden N. Lee J. Loh H.Y. Ong Y.M. Tan I. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and rat PAK (13Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR fragment was used as probe to screen a C. elegans embryonic cDNA library (from Stratagene) under low stringency conditions as described previously (23Chen W. Lim H.H. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 320-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA inserts of positive plaques were isolated by in vivo excision. The complete sequence of the cDNA clones was obtained on both strands using the Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (from U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequence analysis and comparison were performed using the DNAStar program package. Total RNA from each developmental stage was isolated as described (23Chen W. Lim H.H. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 320-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nylon filter containing these RNAs was subjected to hybridization under high stringency conditions (23Chen W. Lim H.H. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 320-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a 5′ EcoRI/BamHI fragment of CePAK cDNA as probe (Fig. 1). The coding regions of CePAK was isolated by PCR using specific primers. The resulting fragment was restricted by SmaI prior to in frame ligation into SmaI site of GST (glutathione S-transferase) expression vector pGEX-3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The fusion protein GST/CePAK was induced and purified as described (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.42Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose filters containing the purified GST fusion protein of the full-length CePAK were incubated overnight at 4°C in renaturation solution (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol) (14Prigmore E.

CeRac1, CDC42Ce, and CeRhoA (28Diekmann D. Brill S. Garrett M.D. Totty N. Hsuan J. Monfries C. Hall C. Lim L. Hall A. Nature. 1991; 351: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) were labeled separately with either [γ-35S]GTP or [β-35S]GDP (both at 1200 Ci/mmol, from DuPont NEN) as described (30Chen W. Blanc J. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 820-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of the radiolabeled Rho p21s to CePAK was then carried out as described (14Prigmore E. Ahmed S. Best A. Kozma R. Manser E. Segal A.W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10717-10722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiment was carried out as described (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.42Google Scholar) with 800 μg of the cytosolic fraction of mixed-stage population (29Chen W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32394-32404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), incubated with either 20 μg of the affinity-purified CePAK antibody (see below) or preimmune serum. The filter containing the immunoprecipitation complex was subjected to the in situ kinase assay by incubating for 30 min at room temperature in 1 ml of 40 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 50 μCi/ml [γ-33P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, from DuPont NEN) containing either cold γGTP-CeRac1 or cold γGTP-CDC42Ce labeled as described for the Rho p21s binding assay. The filters were washed as described (21Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). p21 binding assay was separately carried out on these filters using either [γ-35S]GTP-CeRac1 or [γ-35S]GTP-CDC42Ce as described above. Filters were then autoradiographed overnight at −70°C. Embryos of C. elegans were collected by the alkaline hypochlorite method as described (25Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 587Google Scholar). They were then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline plus 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 4 μg/ml pepstatin. The suspension was sonicated, and the cytosolic and particulate fractions were prepared by high speed centrifugation as described (29Chen W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32394-32404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunizations of rabbit were carried out as described (29Chen W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32394-32404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by injecting into rabbits the GST fusion proteins of a partial CePAK coding region, issued from cloning the PCR fragment with LLWN149 and 124 as primers (Fig. 1) into pGEX-3 plasmid, CeRac1 and CDC42Ce previously expressed and purified in E. coli (23Chen W. Lim H.H. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 320-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Chen W. Lim H.H. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13280-13285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies were subsequently affinity-purified using the ImmunoPure Ag/Ab Immobilization Kit (Pierce) as described (29Chen W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32394-32404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using both cytosolic and particulate embryonic extracts was carried out as described (29Chen W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32394-32404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the affinity-purified antibodies against CePAK, CeRac1, and CDC42Ce, respectively. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Corp.). To determine the specificity of the CeRac1 and CDC42Ce antibodies, nitrocellulose filters containing both 2 μg of CeRac1/GST and 2 μg of CDC42Ce/GST proteins were prepared as above and incubated with CeRac1 and CDC42Ce antibodies separately. Embryos of C. elegans were collected and treated as described (31Miller D.M. Shakes D.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 365-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). They were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20 and 2% dried milk powder (solution A) and incubated overnight at 4°C with 0.5 μg of each of the following antibodies: CePAK, CeRac1, CDC42Ce, and MH27 (recognizing exclusively the hypodermal cell boundaries). These embryos were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with Indocarbocyanine (C3)-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), whereas those treated with MH27 were incubated with Rhodamine-coupled anti-mouse antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Nick Harden in our laboratory). The embryos were finally resuspended in the mounting solution (29Chen W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32394-32404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and examined through fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Rhodamine filter 487715. Kodak Ektachrome color films were used for photography. Negative controls include the secondary antibody alone, preimmune serum, and the antibodies against CePAK, CeRac1, and CDC42Ce that were blocked with excess of the respective GST fusion proteins. The p21 Rac/CDC42-activated kinase (PAK) has been shown to be a direct target of these members of the Rho subfamily because it binds exclusively to their active GTP-bound form, and the kinase activity is greatly enhanced upon binding to these Rho p21s (13Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). To investigate its involvement in C. elegans development and establish a biological link to CeRac1 and CDC42Ce previously isolated in our laboratory (23Chen W. Lim H.H. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 320-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Chen W. Lim H.H. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13280-13285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we set out to isolate the nematode PAK homologue. As a first step, we designed degenerate oligos LLWN91 and LLWN92 based on the highly conserved kinase domains between the prototype rat α-PAK (13Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar) and its Drosophila homologue (22Harden N. Lee J. Loh H.Y. Ong Y.M. Tan I. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The sequence of the 150-base pair fragment issued from PCR using a C. elegans mixed-stage cDNA library indicated its identity as part of the putative nematode PAK cDNA. This fragment was then used as probe to screen a C. elegans embryonic cDNA library (from Stratagene). Four clones were isolated from 2 × 105 plaques, and inserts were cloned into Bluescript SK plasmid via in vivo excision. Sequence analysis indicated that the largest clone of 2348 base pairs contained an open reading region coding for 572 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular size of 64 kDa (Fig. 1), whereas the three others were partial clones of identical sequence (data not shown). At the amino acid sequence level, the deduced CePAK polypeptide displayed an overall 52.8 and 53.5% sequence similarity compared with DPAK and rat α-PAK, respectively. However, the similarity level was significantly higher within the two conserved domains; 75 and 72% sequence identity were found in the N-terminal p21-binding domain (spanning 57 amino acid residues; Fig. 2) between CePAK and DPAK and between CePAK and rat α-PAK, respectively, whereas the C-terminal kinase domain (spanning 275 amino acid residues; Fig. 2) of CePAK displayed 80 and 76% identity compared with that of DPAK and rat α-PAK, respectively. This high degree of sequence conservation therefore suggests an important role for PAK in animal development. In collaboration with Dr. A. Coulson (Medical Research Council, UK), the CePAK cDNA was mapped to chromosome X in close proximity to kin-2 coding for the regulatory subunit of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (32Lu X. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mapping result was further confirmed by the C. elegans genome sequencing project in which the CePAK gene was identified at the same location (Genbank accession number U29612). To investigate the correlation between the highly conserved sequence of CePAK and its activities (i.e. Rac/CDC42 binding and kinase activities), the coding region of CePAK cDNA was cloned into pGEX-3 plasmid and the GST fusion protein was induced and purified from E. coli. The ability of the resulting 97-kDa protein (Fig. 3A) to bind the C. elegans Rho p21s was then analyzed. CeRac1, CDC42Ce, and CeRhoA were labeled separately with either [γ-35S]GTP or [β-35S]GDP and incubated with the nitrocellulose filter containing the CePAK/GST fusion protein. Results indicated that CePAK displayed conserved p21 binding activity by binding to the GTP-bound CeRac1 and the GTP-bound CDC42Ce (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 3) but not to the GTP-bound CeRhoA (Fig. 3B, lane 5) nor to any of the GDP-bound C. elegans Rho p21s (Fig. 3B, lanes 2, 4, and 6). This 97-kDa GST/CePAK fusion protein was unable to phosphorylate its substrate MBP, and autophosphorylation was not observed under standard conditions (13Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the endogenous CePAK possesses any kinase activity, a polyclonal antibody was raised by injecting into rabbits the GST fusion protein with the partial coding region of the CePAK cDNA (using LLWN149 and 124 as primers in the polymerase chain reaction; Fig. 1). A single band of 70 kDa, which was present in both the cytosolic and particular fractions of the embryonic extracts, was recognized by the affinity-purified antibody (Fig. 4); this was close to the size of CePAK expressed in E. coli and may therefore represent the endogenous CePAK. Immunoprecipitation was then carried out by incubating this antibody with the cytosolic extract of a mixed stage population of C. elegans, and the complex was separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel prior to the in situ p21 binding and kinase assay. Results indicated that a 70-kDa protein from the complex between CePAK antibody and the C. elegans extracts, which might be the endogenous CePAK, was able to bind the GTP-bound CDC42Ce (Fig. 5, lane 2) and the GTP-bound CeRac1 but not the GTP-bound CeRhoA (data not shown). More importantly, this 70-kDa protein also exhibited kinase activity in the presence of the GTP-CDC42Ce (Fig. 5, lane 1) and GTP-CeRac1 (data not shown). As a control, no activity in either the p21 binding or the kinase assays was detected from the immunoprecipitation complex between the preimmune serum and the C. elegans extract (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4). Our results therefore indicated that CePAK displayed biochemical activities that were conserved in its homologues from other organisms. We have previously shown by Northern blot analysis that all three members of the C. elegans Rho subfamily were highly expressed during embryonic development (23Chen W. Lim H.H. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 320-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Chen W. Lim H.H. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13280-13285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Chen W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32394-32404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the developmental expression pattern of CePAK, Northern blot analysis on total RNA extracted from six developmental stages was carried out using a EcoRI/BamHI fragment (containing the 520-base pair 5′ region of CePAK; Fig. 1) as probe. Results under high stringent hybridization conditions indicated the presence of a 2.4-kilobase pair mRNA, corresponding to the size of CePAK cDNA, throughout development (Fig. 6A). However, its relative abundance measured by normalizing the signal to that of the nematode actin gene at the corresponding stage (Fig. 6B) indicated that CePAK was highly expressed at embryonic stage (Fig. 6C). Despite a similar expression pattern to the three Rho p21s, the decrease of the CePAK mRNA level from L1 stage onward was more dramatic and probably reflects an even more important role of CePAK in embryogenesis. Embryogenesis in C. elegans, which takes 14 h from fertilization to hatching, can be divided into two distinct phases (2Priess J.R. Hirsh D.I. Dev. Biol. 1986; 117: 156-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The first phase of 7 h is marked by rapid cell proliferation with two-thirds of the total somatic cells generated. In contrast, morphogenesis is the most prominent event during the second 7 h of the embryogenesis, whereby virtually no cell division is detected but the embryo body has elongated 4-fold. Such an elongation event involves dramatic cytoskeletal reorganization because the C. elegans embryo remains at a constant volume during the entire process. To investigate further the function of CePAK in embryogenesis as suggested by its high level of mRNA, its tissue distribution was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence using the affinity-purified anti-CePAK antibody. Whereas no signal was detected in early embryogenesis where cell proliferation takes place, CePAK was specifically localized at all hypodermal cell boundaries throughout the second phase of the embryogenesis (Fig. 7, A-E). The identity of these cells as hypodermal cells was supported by the identical staining pattern of the MH 27 monoclonal antibody, which exclusively recognizes hypodermal cell boundaries (kindly provided by Dr. Cousu-Hresko, University of Washington) (Fig. 7F). Hypodermal cells have been shown to be responsible for embryonic body elongation by squeezing the circumferentially oriented microfilament bundles attached to adherens junctions at their apical membranes (2Priess J.R. Hirsh D.I. Dev. Biol. 1986; 117: 156-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 5Podbilewicz B. White J.G. Dev. Biol. 1994; 161: 408-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). During the elongation event, boundaries of the hypodermal cells disappear progressively as the distance between the longitudinal margins of each cell increase, whereas that between the circumferential margins decrease. The CePAK staining pattern coincided with these cell shape changes, as illustrated from an embryo at the beginning of elongation (Fig. 7A) when all hypodermal cell boundaries were still present (arrowhead) to an elongated embryo (Fig. 7E) where only two continuous longitudinal boundaries were observed (arrowheads). Fig. 7, panels B-D, represented embryos at intermediate steps where a decreasing number of cell boundaries was observed. Despite their identical staining pattern, it is unlikely that the CePAK antibody cross-reacts with MH27 antibody because the latter recognizes a much larger 150-kDa protein (33Francis R. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 465-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 34Cousu-Hresko M. Williams B.D. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 491-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As a negative control, no signal was detected in similar immunofluorescence analysis using the CePAK antibody, which was blocked by the GST/CePAK fusion protein (data not shown). Our results therefore suggest an involvement of CePAK in the dynamic cell shape changes during embryonic body elongation, with a possible function in the reorganization of adherens junctions. In support of this involvement, the homologue of PAK in Drosophila (DPAK) has been implicated in the actin assembly at adherens junctions (22Harden N. Lee J. Loh H.Y. Ong Y.M. Tan I. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). DPAK is highly expressed in the leading edge of epidermal cells whose shape changes are responsible for dorsal closure, a morphogenetic event in which Rho p21s are also implicated (10Harden N. Loh H.Y. Chia W. Lim L. Development. 1995; 121: 903-914PubMed Google Scholar, 22Harden N. Lee J. Loh H.Y. Ong Y.M. Tan I. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a transient loss of of both DPAK and the components of adherens junctions (i.e. actin and myosin) was observed during dorsal closure (22Harden N. Lee J. Loh H.Y. Ong Y.M. Tan I. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This may be correlated to hypodermal cell fusion in C. elegans, in which adherens junctions at cell boundaries (where CePAK was localized) disappear progressively, and therefore points to a conserved mechanism in cell shape changes mediated by PAK in these organisms. Both GTP-CeRac1 and GTP-CDC42Ce bind to CePAK (see above). To determine whether these two p21s play a role in the hypodermal cell fusion, polyclonal antibodies against CeRac1 and CDC42Ce were raised and used in indirect immunofluorescence analysis. The affinity-purified antibodies against either CeRac1 or CDC42Ce recognized a single 23-kDa protein in extracts of mixed stage population of C. elegans (Fig. 7I). The specificity of these two antibodies was demonstrated by control Western blot analysis with either recombinant CeRac1/GST or CDC42Ce/GST proteins, which showed no cross-reactivity of the antibodies (data not shown). Indirect immunofluorescence analysis using these two antibodies indicated that these two Rho proteins were ubiquitously expressed throughout embryogenesis (data not shown), as would be expected from their known involvement in morphogenesis and development (6Ridley A. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3017) Google Scholar, 7Ridley A. Hall A.

However, at the stage when hypodermal cell fusion was occurring both CeRac1 (Fig. 7G) and CDC42Ce (Fig. 7H) were found to localize with CePAK at the cell boundaries. No signal was detected using these antibodies when they were blocked with their respective GST fusion proteins (data not shown). This co-localization suggests that these two p21s may participate with PAK in embryonic body elongation. In contrast, similar analysis using the CeRhoA antibody raised previously (29Chen W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32394-32404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that CeRhoA was not detected in cell boundaries throughout embryogenesis (data not shown). Taken together, our localization results disclose a possible functional link between CeRac1 and CDC42Ce and their downstream target (CePAK) in a common morphogenetic process, similar to the involvement of both DRac and DPAK in dorsal closure in Drosophila (22Harden N. Lee J. Loh H.Y. Ong Y.M. Tan I. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The localization of these two p21s at the hypodermal cell boundaries (possibly at adherens junctions) is also consistent with the findings in Drosophila implicating both DRac and DCDC42 in epithelial cell shape changes, with DRac involved in the recruitment of actin at adherens junctions and DCDC42 in polarized cell shape changes (11Eaton S. Auvinen P. Luo L. Jan Y.N. Simons K. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 131: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have shown in this study that the sequence of C. elegans p21Rac1/CDC42-activated kinase (CePAK) is highly conserved within the p21-binding and kinase domains. This sequence conservation is also reflected in its conserved biochemical activities. An involvement of CePAK in C. elegans embryogenesis is indicated by its high mRNA level in embryos and more importantly by its localization to the hypodermal cell boundaries during embryonic body elongation. The colocalization of the CeRac1 and CDC42Ce with CePAK is consistent with our in vitro binding results as well as with these GTPases being activators of PAK (13Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar) and may indicate their common involvement in morphogenetic events during C. elegans development.

https://openalex.org/W2004821315,"Interaction of the blood clotting proteinase, thrombin, with fibrin monomer and heparin to form a thrombin· fibrin monomer·heparin ternary complex is accompanied by a change in thrombin catalytic specificity. Equilibrium binding interactions in the assembly of the ternary complex were characterized quantitatively using thrombin labeled at the active site with a fluorescent probe and related to changes in thrombin specificity toward exosite I-dependent binding of hirudin and cleavage of fibrinogen. Changes in the active site environment accompanying binding of heparin or fibrin to thrombin in binary complexes were reported by fluorescence enhancements which contributed additively to the perturbation accompanying formation of the ternary complex. Quantitative analysis of the interactions supports a preferentially ordered path of ternary complex assembly, in which initial binding of heparin to thrombin facilitates binding of fibrin monomer with an ~40-fold increased affinity. Binding of fibrin monomer in the ternary complex decreased the affinity of native thrombin for hirudin by >100-fold and inhibited cleavage of fibrinogen, but this inhibition was overcome when fibrin(ogen)-fibrin interactions occurred. These results support a ternary complex model in which heparin binding through exosite II of thrombin facilitates fibrin monomer binding via exosite I, with accompanying changes in thrombin catalytic specificity resulting from perturbations in the active site and reduced accessibility of exosite I to hirudin and fibrinogen."

Corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids have distinct tissue-specific effects on expression of α, β, and γENaC. In rat lung epithelia and kidney collecting duct cells, administration of dexamethasone or aldosterone leads to increased expression of the αENaC mRNA associated with an increase in Na+ current (13Champigny G.

In contrast, in rat distal colon, dietary Na+ deprivation or the administration of dexamethasone leads to an increase in βENaC and γENaC mRNA with no apparent effects on α subunit expression (8Lingueglia E.

In the colon, the magnitude of increase in γENaC mRNA following Na+ deprivation correlates with the increase in Na+ transport. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies indicate that although the αENaC message is constitutively expressed, the protein is detectable only under conditions where γENaC is also expressed (8Lingueglia E.

This suggests γENaC expression may be a rate-limiting step that determines processing and insertion of the ENaC complex at the apical membrane of epithelia. While the membrane topology of the hγENaC is unknown, αENaC has two membrane spanning domains and intracellular amino and carboxyl termini (16Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

Splice variants of αENaC in rat taste tissues introduce a premature stop codon that predicts a deleted second transmembrane domain, which, although retaining [3H]phenamil binding, does not generate Na+ currents when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (18Li X.J. Xu R.H. Guggino W.B. Snyder S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1133-1140PubMed Google Scholar). An alternate form of βENaC in human colon, lung, and nasal epithelium introduces significant modifications in the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the predicted protein with uncharacterized consequences (19Voilley N.

Mutations of the ENaC complex have been identified in human disease. Liddle's syndrome, an autosomal dominant hypertensive disorder, is a consequence of an activating mutation in the carboxyl-terminal region of β or γENaC that leads to increased unregulated renal Na+ reabsorption (20Shimkets R.A.

To understand the factors that control gene expression, and the potential significance of alternate splice variants, it is essential to define the structure of the ENaC genes. Here we report on the genomic organization and the 5′ flanking region of human γENaC (hγENaC). A human lung tumor cell line H441 (ATCC, Rockville, MD) was used for RNA preparation, primer extension analysis, and ribonuclease protection assay. Total RNA was prepared by solubilization of H441 cells in guanidinium thiocyanate buffer followed by extraction first with Tris-saturated and then water-saturated phenol and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol (25Chomcznyski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was also prepared from a human cortical collecting duct (CCD) cell line (26Prie D. Friedlander G. Coureau C. Vandewalle A. Cassingena R. Ronco P.M. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 1310-1318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and from lung tissue obtained from a 5-month-old infant. Adult human kidney RNA was purchased (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). We obtained 5′ RACE Ready™ single-stranded human brain cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) which has an anchor sequence 5′-CACGAATTCACTATCGATTCTGGAACCTTCAGAGG-NH2 ligated to its 3′ end. A primer complementary to this anchor sequence and reverse primers 5′-GGCCGCGGGACACCACGATG (+148 to +129 from the initiation codon) and 5′-CGGCGACAGCCATGGGTGTTG (+128 to +107 from the initiation codon) were used in a semi-nested PCR reaction using Taq polymerase. First round and second round PCR were performed for 35 cycles each at 94°C for 30 s, with annealing at 63°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 3 min. We also obtained human kidney Marathon-ready™ cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) which has an adapter sequence ligated to both ends. An adapter primer 5′ CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC and the +148 to +129 gene-specific primer were used in a single-round PCR reaction with annealing at 63°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 2 min for 40 cycles. Amplified fragments from PCR reactions were cloned into pBluescript IISK- (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or pCRII (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and several clones sequenced by automated fluorescent DNA sequencing at the University of Iowa DNA core facility. An antisense oligonucleotide primer 5′ GGGCGCCTGAGGGCCCGTCAC spanning bases +68 to +48 from the initiation codon was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and gel-purified. Labeled primer was hybridized with either total H441 RNA or yeast tRNA at 65°C for 90 min in 150 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.3, and 1 mM EDTA. The primer was then extended with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 50°C for 60 min, in a reaction mixture that included 50 mM KCl, 23 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 10 mM MgCl2, 5.5 mM DTT, 330 μM EDTA and 150 μM dNTPs. The samples were then precipitated with ethanol and extended products analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Total cellular RNA was reverse-transcribed with the +148 to +129 primer exactly as described for primer extension analysis except in control reactions reverse transcriptase was omitted. An aliquot of RNA (−RT) or first strand cDNA was used in a PCR reaction with Taq polymerase for 40 cycles with denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 59°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 3 min. The forward primer was 5′CGCTGCCAGGGGATGCTAGC (−124 to −105 from the initiation codon), and the reverse primer was that used for first strand synthesis.

Membranes were hybridized at 65°C overnight in 7% SDS, 250 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, and 1 mM EDTA and then washed several times with 1 mM EDTA, 40 mM Na2HPO4, and 1% SDS at 65°C. Positive clones were re-screened either by dot-blot hybridization with the same labeled DNA fragment or alternatively by PCR. Portions of hγENaC genomic DNA were then restriction mapped and partially sequenced by automated fluorescent DNA sequencing (service provided by the University of Iowa DNA Core facility). DNA sequence was analyzed for transcription factor binding motifs using MacDNASIS and for CpG islands using GRAIL DNA sequence analysis software at http://avalon.epm.ornl.gov/gallery.html. To map the 5′ end of hγENaC, a DNA template was assembled in pBluescriptII SK-, where the 269-bp human brain cDNA (+1 to +269) has been cloned into the EcoRV site. Two primers 5′ TTGTGAAGTCGTGGCCCGCT and 5′ GCTGCTCCTCTGCTCGCTCTCG were used to amplify a fragment that extended 121 bp upstream and 60 bp downstream of the putative transcription start site in cosmid clone 404D2. This fragment was then spliced to the brain cDNA fragment using an NheI site at +33 to give a DNA construct that extended from −121 to + 269 of γENaC. The construct was sequenced to exclude cloning errors. After linearization with EcoRI, 1 μg of template DNA was used in an in vitro transcription reaction to synthesize a 457-nt 32P-labeled antisense cRNA probe. This probe was hybridized overnight with 20 μg of sample RNA or yeast RNA at 45°C in 80% formamide, 400 mM NaCl, and 40 mM Pipes, pH 6.4 (29Mason P.J. Enver T. Wilkinson D. Williams J.G. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Gene Transcription. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 5Google Scholar). Samples were digested with 1 unit/μl RNase T1 (Ambion, Austin, TX) and analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Mapping of exon-intron boundaries in cosmid clones were determined by amplification of intronic sequences within cosmid clones using primers designed from cDNA sequence. Typically primers were designed with a GC content of 55 to 75% and a Tm of 60 to 70°C. Long distance PCR was performed with rTth DNA polymerase XL (Perkin-Elmer) with a single anneal and extend step at 68°C for 5-10 min and 40 cycles. Amplified fragments were purified, restriction mapped, and in some cases directly sequenced to determine exon-intron junctions. A partial length hγENaC cDNA has been cloned and reported by at least two groups. The 2204-bp clone isolated by McDonald et al. (11McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 267: C1157-C1163Crossref Google Scholar) has a 1947-bp open reading frame that codes for a protein of 649 amino acids and includes 22 bp of 5′ UTR and 232 bp of 3′ UTR. This cDNA when co-expressed in oocytes with hα/βENaC potentiated an amiloride-sensitive Na+ current suggesting that the full coding sequence was contained within this clone. The cDNA clone isolated by Voilley et al. (19Voilley N. Bassilana F. Mignon C. Merscher S. Mattei M.G. Carle G.F. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. Genomics. 1995; 28: 560-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) starts with the presumed translation start codon and in addition to the protein coding region includes 1435 bp of 3′ UTR including a potential poly(A) tail. To delineate the full extent of the 5′ UTR we performed 5′ RACE using anchor-ligated single-stranded human brain cDNA in a semi-nested PCR reaction. A single ~300-bp fragment was amplified, cloned into pBluescript, and inserts were sequenced. All clones were identical, ending at the same position and adding an additional 119 bases of RNA upstream of the known sequence thus making the 5′ UTR 141 bases long (Fig. 1). We also performed 5′ RACE in human kidney, a tissue where γENaC is more abundantly expressed. We amplified a PCR product that was cloned into pCRII and eight clones were sequenced. All eight kidney clones were shorter and began at +39 to +70 from the 5′ terminus seen in brain (Fig. 1). McDonald and co-workers (10McDonald F.J. Snyder P.M. McCray P.B. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L728-L734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line H441 expresses the hαENaC mRNA. We wanted to know if these cells express hγENaC and, if so, to determine transcription start sites. A radiolabeled antisense oligonucleotide primer corresponding to hγENaC was hybridized to H441 RNA and the primer extended with reverse transcriptase. Two discrete bands, 220 and 150 bases long, were detected in H441 RNA (Fig. 2, A and B). The larger product correlates with the size of the brain 5′ RACE clones suggesting that the transcription start site in human brain and the more upstream transcription start site in H441 cells are similar. However, an alternate 5′-spliced exon that gives rise to a different 5′ UTR of a similar size in brain versus lung epithelia could also explain these findings. To evaluate this possibility, we performed RT-PCR in H441 RNA designed to amplify a 272-bp cDNA that begins at base −124 of the brain 5′ UTR sequence (Fig. 2C). We amplified a single fragment of the predicted size making it highly likely that the 5′ UTR in brain and kidney was also present in H441 cells. We screened a human chromosome 16-specific cosmid library using a probe corresponding to the 5′ end of hγENaC cDNA and isolated several cosmid clones. These were restriction mapped and partially sequenced and appear to represent overlapping clones that cover a physical distance of at least 30 kb. Two clones, 404D2 and 320H2, were further characterized. Clone 404D2 contained the first exon and extended just downstream of the exon X, while 320H2 also includes the entire 3′ UTR. The intron-exon boundaries of the hγENaC gene were mapped to exon XII and are shown in Table I and Fig. 3. The 5′ UTR is interrupted by a 3800-bp intron at position −44 from the translation start codon. The other exons vary in size ranging from 76 bases in exon XI to over 1200 bases in exon XII which contains the translation stop codon and most of the 3′ UTR. The 5′ splice junction and the 3′ splice junction sequences at the exon-intron boundaries match consensus splice signals gtnagt and (y)10ncag, respectively, and are shown in Table I (30Padgett R.A.

Open table in a new tab Having obtained genomic clones that included the first exon and upstream genomic fragments, we sequenced 450 bp of putative 5′ flanking DNA, the first exon, and contiguous portion of the first intron. The DNA sequence corresponding to the first exon matches the cDNA exactly. We used this information to accurately characterize transcription start sites by a ribonuclease protection assay using a construct that included 121 bp of 5′ flanking DNA and the first 269 bp of γENaC brain cDNA (−121+269). A single ~270-nt protected fragment was seen in human kidney and lung (Fig. 4A). The absence of a protected fragment of a larger size excludes an alternate upstream transcription start site in these tissues. The protected fragment in kidney and lung was resolved on a sequencing gel to two bands − 269 and 266/267 nt long (Fig. 4B). The larger, more abundant band defined a 5′ terminus identical to that seen in brain. A transcript was not identified in H441 cells or in renal CCD cells, probably secondary to relatively low abundance of this subunit mRNA in these cell lines. The sequence at the 5′ end of the gene was analyzed for consensus transcription factor binding motifs. As shown in Fig. 5A, the 5′ flanking genomic DNA immediately upstream of the transcription start site contains two GC boxes (GGGGCGGGGC) at −21 and −52 but does not contain a canonical TATA or CCAAT box. The transcription factor Sp1 binds to these types of GC-rich motifs and in an as yet undefined way can in turn bind to TFIID in the presence of co-activators to initiate transcription in some TATA-less promoters (31Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). TATA-less promoters tend to initiate transcription at heterogeneous sites although the relevance of these alternate start sites to RNA processing and protein translation is relatively unknown (32Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 33Sehgal A. Patil N. Chao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3160-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Other potential transcription factor binding sites that were identified include AP-2 sites (+286, +191, −13, −239), other Sp1 sites (+257, −102, −150, −211, −222), NF-IL6 sites (−74, −262), cAMP response element (CRE) sites (+179), and PEA-3 sites (−174, −306). The dyad glucocorticoid response element (GRE) motif AGAACANNNTGTTCT was not identified within the sequenced portion. By 5′ RACE, a single 5′ terminus was identified in human brain, and heterogeneous products 39 to 70 bases shorter were obtained in human kidney (Fig. 1). The kidney library used for this reaction was created by blunt ending of double-stranded cDNA prior to adapter ligation and may have resulted in shorter 5′ termini (34Lehman I.R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 29: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The preparation of human brain cDNA library did not include second strand cDNA synthesis or the use of an exonuclease, and the results obtained were consistent with a single transcription start site. When we examined transcription start sites by primer extension analysis of H441 RNA, two products were seen, suggesting that, at least in this cell line, two transcription start sites may be present (Fig. 2B). To clarify whether additional transcription start sites are present, we performed a ribonuclease protection assay in several tissues including H441 cells. The synthesized riboprobe was designed to (i) examine whether additional upstream transcription start sites were present, (ii) to investigate the shorter primer-extended product seen in H441 cells, and (iii) to accurately localize identified start sites. A protected fragment was identified in human kidney and lung tissue, which was resolved on a sequencing gel to two bands, 3 nt apart, and confirmed that the principal transcription start site was identical in kidney, brain, and lung (Fig. 4). Since we were unable to identify a transcript in H441 cells by nuclease protection, we cannot exclude the possibility that the shorter primer-extended product might be produced by hindrance to reverse transcription from the secondary structure of the 5′ end of hγENaC. We report here the genomic organization of hγENaC, defining intron-exon boundaries and portions of 5′ flanking DNA. Two GC boxes are identified within ~50 bp of the transcription start site, whereas a TATA box or a CCAAT box is not seen. In some tissues, expression of hγENaC is increased by mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids both of which bind to GRE to induce transcription of many genes. Within the 450-bp 5′ flanking region that we have sequenced to date, this element is not identified. This may mean that a GRE may be present elsewhere in the gene or that the effect of adrenal steroids on hγENaC expression is via a secondary pathway. A 650-bp region that includes ~350 bp of 5′ flanking sequence, all of the first exon, and proximal portions of the first intron is G + C rich. The GC content is 68%, with 60 CpG dinucleotides in this 600-bp region (Fig. 5B). The ratio of the observed frequency to the expected frequency of CpG dinucleotides of 0.697, and a GC content greater than 50% fulfills the definition of a CpG island (35Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2611) Google Scholar). CpG islands are characteristically seen in the 5′ portion of several genes, and one mechanism that determines relative activity of promoter elements in these CpG islands is the state of methylation of cytosine residues in 5′-CpG dinucleotides (36Bird A.P. Nature. 1986; 321: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (2973) Google Scholar). Typically, CpG islands are hypomethylated in housekeeping genes, while selective expression of some regulated genes is determined in part by tissue-specific methyltransferases, which methylate CpG islands and silence or inhibit transcription in nonexpressing cells (37Bird A. Cell. 1992; 70: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 38Doerfler W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 93-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The human β and γENaC are located within 400 kb of each other on chromosome 16p12, and αENaC is located on chromosome 12 (11McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J.

Genomics. 1995; 28: 560-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analogous activating mutations in β or γ subunits lead to the same phenotype, Liddles's syndrome (20Shimkets R.A. Warnock D.G. Bositis C.M. Nelson-Williams C. Hansson J.H. Schambelan M. Gill Jr., J.R. Ulick S. Milora R.V. Findling J.W. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 407-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar, 21Hansson J.H.

Furthermore, at least in some tissues, there is co-ordinate regulation of β and γ in contrast to α. For example, dietary Na+ deprivation and systemic steroid administration lead to an increase in β and γ subunit expression in rat colonic epithelium (8Lingueglia E. Renard S. Waldmann R. Voilley N.

Thus, their proximity in the genome raises the possibility that they are arranged in tandem or otherwise share regulatory regions.

Previous studies using model Holliday junctions suggested that a certain size of central core of homology and a specific sequence in the junction were required for efficient cleavage by RuvC, although not for binding. To determine the minimum length of sequence homology required for RuvC cleavage, we made a series of synthetic Holliday junctions with various lengths of homologous sequence in the core region. It was demonstrated that a monomobile junction possessing only 2 base pairs of the homology core was efficiently cleaved by RuvC. To study the sequence specificity for cleavage, we made 16 bimobile junctions, which differed only in the homologous core sequence. Among them, 6 junctions were efficiently cleaved. Cleavage occurred by introduction of nicks symmetrically at the 3′-side of thymine in all cases. However, the nucleotide bases at the 3′-side of the thymines were not always identical between the two strands nicked. These results suggest that RuvC recognizes mainly topological symmetry of the Holliday junction but not the sequence symmetry per se, that the thymine residue at the cleavage site plays an important role for RuvC-mediated resolution, and that a long homologous core sequence is not essential for cleavage.

The Holliday junction (HJ) 1The abbreviations used are: HJHolliday junctionbpbase pairPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisM1-M4mobile HJs 1-4IMimmobile HJ. is an important intermediate in the proposed pathway for genetic recombination and recombination repair (Holliday, 1964). In it, two homologous DNA molecules are joined at the single strand crossover by a four-armed DNA structure. Although there have been reports about putative Holliday junction cleavage activities in yeast and mammals (Shinagawa and Iwasaki, 16Shinagawa H. Iwasaki H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the Escherichia coli RuvC protein is the first cellular enzyme that has been highly purified and shown to resolve HJs in vitro (Dunderdale et al., 9Dunderdale H.J.

Studies using HJ analogs have demonstrated that RuvC-mediated resolution occurs by the introduction of symmetrical nicks into two of the four DNA strands around the junction, resulting in two nicked duplex DNAs (Dunderdale et al., 9Dunderdale H.J.

The two catalytic centers of endonuclease activity in the RuvC dimer are symmetrically located at the bottom of the DNA binding cleft, consistent with the relative position of the nicks observed biochemically (Ariyoshi et al., 1Ariyoshi M.

Although recognition of HJs by RuvC is structure-specific, the cleavage reaction additionally requires a divalent cation such as Mg2+ and a homologous sequence core with a certain length, such as 12 bp in two symmetrically related strands of the HJs (Bennett et al., 4Bennett R.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15132-15139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immobile synthetic HJs that had no homology core sequences were not resolved by RuvC (Dunderdale et al., 9Dunderdale H.J.

Holliday junction base pair polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mobile HJs 1-4 immobile HJ. The physical structure of HJs is also a question of great interest. With small synthetic HJs as model substrates, it was shown that the HJ forms a “stacked X structure” in which the arms of the junction are antiparallel (Duckett et al., 8Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I.H.

The stacked X structure exhibits 2-fold symmetry, with two strands approximating B-form DNA, whereas the complementary strands are sharply bent as they pass from one helix to the other (Duckett et al., 8Duckett D.R.

Diekmann S. von Kitzing E. Kemper B. Lilley D.M.J. Cell. 1988; 55: 79-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, the HJs used in these studies (defined here as immobile HJs) were not substrates for RuvC, because they did not contain a homologous core sequence, which allows spontaneous branch migration of the junctions. Therefore, a question remains whether the structures of the immobile junctions are the same as the catalytically competent substrates. On the other hands, synthetic HJs that are cleavable by RuvC can branch migrate spontaneously within the homologous core sequence (mobile HJs), and experimental determination of a single mobile (catalytically competent) HJ structure among the many isomers would be difficult. In this work, to understand the RuvC cleavage requirement for the homologous core sequence and to obtain new insights into molecular mechanisms of the HJ resolution by the protein, we designed a systematic series of synthetic HJs. First, we varied the size of the homologous core sequence from 10 bp with five possible steps of branch point migration (pentamobile HJ) to 2 bp with only a single possible step (monomobile) and analyzed cleavability by RuvC. Second, the sequence specificity for RuvC cleavage was examined in bimobile HJs (4 bp of homology core; two steps of possible branch point migration freedom) with all possible sequence variations in the homologous core. The oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized with an automated synthesizer (ABI 380B). These oligonucleotides were purified by reverse-phase C18 column chromatography. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan). All other reagents (highest available grade) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). RuvC protein was purified as described (Iwasaki et al., 11Iwasaki H. Takahagi M. Shiba T. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4381-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The concentration of RuvC was determined by using a molar extinction coefficient of 7.0 × 103M−1 cm−1 at 280 nm. Synthetic HJs were prepared by annealing stoichiometric amounts (10 μM each in terms of the junction molecule) of four 24-mer oligonucleotides as described (Shida et al., 15Shida T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Kyogoku Y. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Higher concentrations of oligonucleotide were required to form stable HJs from 24-mer oligonucleotides (Shida et al., 15Shida T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Kyogoku Y. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). One of the four oligonucleotides was uniquely labeled at the 5′-end using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase before annealing. Sequences of the oligonucleotides are shown in the appropriate figures. The standard reaction mixture (10 μl) containing a 32P-labeled synthetic DNA junction (5 μM) and RuvC (20 μM) in the reaction buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 8 mM MgCl2, 50 mM sodium glutamate, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol was incubated for 20 min at 37°C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 2.5 μl of 100 mM EDTA, and the reaction mixtures were evaporated to dryness. The reaction products were dissolved in the loading solution (8 M urea, 0.25% bromophenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol), denatured by heat, and analyzed by 20% PAGE containing 7 M urea and 0.4 × Tris borate/EDTA buffer (90 mM Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 2 mM EDTA), followed by autoradiography. Relative efficiencies of the cleavage reactions with the different substrates were determined by densitometric scanning of the autoradiography with a densitometer (Shimadzu CS9000). RuvC cleavage sites were identified by comparison of the cleavage product bands with 5′-32P-labeled synthetic markers (11-13 mer with sequences identical to the possible products). The assay was performed as described (Shida et al., 15Shida T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Kyogoku Y. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In previous studies, the central core of homology in synthetic HJs was required to be cleavable by RuvC, and the predominant cleavage sites by RuvC were 5′-T↓C-3′ or 5′-T↓G-3′ (Dunderdale et al., 9Dunderdale H.J.

Cell. 1994; 79: 853-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To determine the minimum homologous core still cleavable by RuvC, we made a series of HJs keeping the sequence TC in the homologous core and varying the size of homology (Fig. 1). The synthetic mobile HJs, M1 (bimobile), M2 (trimobile), M3 (tetramobile), and M4 (pentamobile) contain, respectively, 4, 6, 8, and 10 bp of homologous sequences around the crossover, which allows, respectively, two through five steps of possible branch point migration freedom. An immobile junction, IM, which does not possess a homologous core sequence, was used as a control. RuvC bound to all of the HJs with the same affinity, as judged by a gel retardation assay, and mediated the cleavage of all mobile HJs at almost the same high efficiency (~95% of the substrates cleaved) except M4, which was less efficiently cleaved (~70% cleaved), and IM, the cleavage of which was not detected (Fig. 2). To determine the cleavage sites in the junctions, the products were analyzed by denaturing PAGE (Fig. 2). All of the mobile HJs were cleaved by the introduction of single nicks into strands 2 and 4. These cleavage sites were symmetrically related within the homologous core and mapped to the sequence 5′-T↓C-3′ in all cases. The cleavage sites are indicated in Fig. 1.Fig. 2Detection of RuvC-mediated cleavage products of the mobile HJs. HJs containing a uniquely 5′-32P-labeled strand were incubated with RuvC. The DNA products were analyzed by 20% denaturing PAGE and autoradiography. Size markers in lanes S2 and S4 consisted of three possible products of strands 2 and 4, respectively, and were 11-13 bases long. Note that all of the cleaved products of strand 2 of M2-M4 showed the same mobility as that of strand 2 of M1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine sequence specificity, if any, for RuvC cleavage, we constructed 16 possible bimobile HJ derivatives of M1 (Fig. 3). Only the homologous core sequence differed. Gel shift assay showed that RuvC bound to all of the bimobile HJs with the same affinity (data not shown). However, only 6 HJs (A, 60%; D, 60%; E, 39%; H, 50%; I, 54%; and P, 93%) were cleaved by RuvC with relatively high efficiency, and the other bimobile HJs were not or very poorly cleaved by RuvC (Fig. 4). The cleavage sites of these HJs were determined and are summarized in Fig. 5. All of the nicks were introduced into exactly symmetrical positions at the 3′-side of thymine within the homologous region. However, there was no specificity for the base at the 3′-side of the thymine. In addition, in the case of A, D, H, and P junctions, the rule of symmetrical sequence identity at the 3′-side of the cleavage site between the opposing strands was not observed (e.g. in the A junction, T↓T of strand 2 and T↓A of strand 4 were the cleavage sites, respectively). This demonstrates that the nucleotide base specificity at the 3′-side of the nicking sites is not a major determinant of RuvC-mediated cleavage. Notably, some of the noncleavable HJs (B, C, L, M, N, and O junctions) also contain thymine in their homologous core sequence; the presence of thymine is obviously not sufficient for cleavage.Fig. 4Resolution of bimobile HJs by RuvC. The DNA products were analyzed by 20% denaturing PAGE. The results of only strands 1 and 2 were shown, because the cleavage sites of the bimobile HJs were symmetrically related (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5Diagram of the RuvC cleavage sites in the bimobile HJs.

The crossover points are arbitrarily positioned.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since sequence identity at the 3′-side of the cleavage site was not absolutely required for RuvC cleavage, certain monomobile HJs may be cleaved efficiently by RuvC. We constructed a monomobile HJ, Q, in which only the T-A bond was exchangeable (Fig. 6A). When junction Q was incubated with RuvC, it was resolved efficiently (~90%) by the introduction of symmetrical nicks at the 3′-side of thymine in the strands 2 and 4 (Fig. 7). As previously seen in the cleavable bimobile HJs, the bases of the 3′-side of cleavage site were different (cytosine in strand 2 and guanine in strand 4). This result also shows that RuvC introduces nicks into the phosphodiester bonds exactly at or 1 base away from the point of strand exchange, because only two junction points are possible in this monomobile junction; the precise distance between the nicking sites and the junction points could not be determined by the previous studies using HJs with larger sizes of homologous core sequences (Dunderdale et al., 9Dunderdale H.J.

The monomobile HJ Q, as shown in Fig. 6, was uniquely 5′-32P labeled and incubated with RuvC. The DNA products were analyzed by 20% denaturing PAGE and autoradiography. Size markers in lanes S2 and S4 consist of three possible products (11-13 bases long) for strands 2 and 4, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cleavage of immobile HJs that had 5′-TC-3′ or 5′-TG-3′ sequences in the junctions, as shown in Fig. 6B, were not detected under our experimental conditions (data not shown); the presence of thymine at the junction is apparently not sufficient for RuvC-mediated cleavage. The present study has provided several novel clues to the molecular mechanism of HJ resolution by RuvC. We have shown that a monomobile HJ was cleavable by RuvC, and this demonstrates that RuvC introduces nicks at or 1 base away from the point of strand exchange (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). In retrospect, the large homology cores (e.g. 12 bp in synthetic HJs) previously used as substrates (Dunderdale et al., 9Dunderdale H.J. Benson F.E. Parsons C.A. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. West S.C. Nature. 1991; 354: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar; Bennett et al., 4Bennett R.J. Dunderdale H.J. West S.C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15132-15139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were not essential. However, not all of the bimobile HJs were cleaved; only 6 bimobile HJs among 16 possible combinations were cleaved by RuvC (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). The size of homology core sequence per se is not the key determinant of cleavage. Introduction of nicks occurred symmetrically at the 3′-side of thymine in all cases, with the nucleotide at the 3′-side of the thymine of cleavage sites varying. In addition, nucleotide bases at the 3′-side of the thymine were not always identical between the two cleaved strands (A, D, H, and P in Figs. 3, 4, 5; and Q in Fig. 6, Fig. 7). Therefore, these results suggest that the thymine residue at the cleavage site plays an important role in RuvC-mediated resolution and that RuvC recognizes mainly topological symmetry of the Holliday junction but not DNA sequence symmetry at both sides of the thymine at the cleavage site. Since some bimobile HJs with thymine in the homologous core (B, C, L, M, N, and O in Fig. 3, Fig. 4) and immobile HJs (S-X in Fig. 6B) were not cleaved, other molecular requirements in addition to the presence of thymine in the homologous core are critical for resolution by RuvC. Unlike restriction enzymes, which recognize and cleave specific primary sequences per se, RuvC may require a certain sequence context for catalysis to occur. This context may, for example, induce a certain structure that can interact productively with RuvC on forming an RuvC-HJ complex. The three-dimensional structure of RuvC has been revealed at a 2.5-Å resolution by x-ray crystallography (Ariyoshi et al., 1Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Iwasaki H. Nakamura H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Cell. 1994; 78: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The subunits in the RuvC dimer are related by a dyad axis, and thus, the DNA binding cleft and catalytic center in each subunit are located symmetrically in the dimer (Saito et al., 13Saito A. Iwasaki H. Ariyoshi M. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7470-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This relative positioning ensures the introduction of symmetrical nicks by RuvC. The computer docking model of RuvC structure with DNAs suggested that the HJ in RuvC consists of two antiparallel, quasicontinuous DNA duplexes linked with at least two unpaired nucleotides. Each DNA duplex is inclined by about 80° to the dyad axis of the dimer (Ariyoshi et al., 1Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Iwasaki H. Nakamura H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Cell. 1994; 78: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This model of HJ differs from that of the protein-free stacked X structure of HJ proposed previously (Duckett et al., 8Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I.H. Diekmann S. von Kitzing E. Kemper B. Lilley D.M.J. Cell. 1988; 55: 79-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar; Cooper and Hagerman, 6Cooper J.P. Hagerman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar; von Kitzing et al., 18von Kitzing E. Lilley D.M.J. Diekmann S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2671-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The stacked X structure exhibits 2-fold symmetry with two strands approximating B-form DNA, whereas the complementary strands are sharply bent where they pass from one helix to the other; as a result, all of the base pairings are maintained around the junction. However, RuvC binding can convert the protein-free junction with a folded stacked X structure into an unfolded form with 2-fold symmetry with base pairings around the crossover disrupted (Bennett et al., 4Bennett R.J. Dunderdale H.J. West S.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar; Bennett and West, 2Bennett R.J. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results suggest that configuration of protein-free HJs is converted into a productive form by RuvC binding. Using synthetic HJs that are constrained to adopt defined isomeric configurations, it has been shown that the nicks are preferentially introduced into the continuous (noncrossing) pair of strands rather than the bent (crossing) pair of strands of antiparallel forms of HJs (Bennett and West, 3Bennett R.J. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5635-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The RuvC-HJ computer docking model agrees with this biochemical evidence. In it, the thymines at the cleavage sites are on the continuous strands of antiparallel forms of HJ and are positioned in the hydrophobic pocket just beside the active sites (Ariyoshi et al., 1Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Iwasaki H. Nakamura H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Cell. 1994; 78: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated by a study using immobile HJs that the choice of partners of crossing or noncrossing strands is governed by the base sequences at the junction (Duckett et al., 8Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I.H. Diekmann S. von Kitzing E. Kemper B. Lilley D.M.J. Cell. 1988; 55: 79-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In the case of mobile HJs the partners of crossing or noncrossing strands may also be changeable during spontaneous branch migration in solution. The cleavable bimobile and monomobile HJs used in this study may be able to form such a catalytically competent structure, whereas the noncleavable ones, including immobile HJs, may not. In summary, the cleavable synthetic HJs may have the following properties: 1) thymines are positioned at or very close to the junction; 2) the strands containing the thymines are continuous (noncrossover) strands, which is governed by the sequence context around the crossover; and 3) the HJ can be converted into a productive form in the complex with RuvC, in which the thymine is in the hydrophobic pocket just beside the active site of RuvC, and base pairings at the crossover are disrupted so that the phosphodiester bond at the 3′-side of the thymine should become closer to the catalytic site. The thymine-containing sequence context around the crossover in the synthetic HJs may determine the ability to adopt such a catalytically competent configuration. This model could explain why RuvC does not cleave all of the synthetic HJs that contain a thymine at the junction. Shah et al. (14Shah R. Bennett R.J. West S.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 853-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have shown that RuvC cleaves the HJs at hot spots with a consensus sequence of 5′-A/TTT↓G/C-3′ in vitro. One of our efficiently cleavable bimobile HJs, P, possesses this consensus sequence, and nicking occurred at 5′-TTT↓G-3′ in strand 1 and 5′-ATT↓C-3′ in strand 3 in this junction (Fig. 5). Therefore, their result does not necessarily conflict with our results. We have found here that HJs that do not possess the consensus sequences were still cleaved by RuvC. They used a HJ made by the RecA protein and then deproteinized. Thus, their substrate can branch migrate over a large DNA sequence, whereas our synthetic HJs have a very limited distance of branch migration, in which two junction points are possible for the monomobile HJ and three junction points are possible for the bimobile HJ. The equilibria among isomers (or choice of junction points) are governed by the sequence contexts around the encountering junction points (Duckett et al., 8Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I.H. Diekmann S. von Kitzing E. Kemper B. Lilley D.M.J. Cell. 1988; 55: 79-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), and they may be quite variable. The consensus sequence might be selected by the two factors: relative stability and cleavable configuration of the junctions with the sequence (with equilibrium biased to such an isomer). However, our cleavable junctions can take only limited numbers of isomers due to the limited junction mobility, which results in relative abundance of the cleavable isomer. It is conceivable that the favorable isomers occur infrequently and rather unstably in a large Holliday structure with freely mobile junctions. We thank Drs. Kosuke Morikawa and Susan Tsunegawa at the Biomolecular Engineering Research Institute for useful discussion and critical reading of the manuscript."

The neurotoxic properties of unconjugated bilirubin make its accumulation undesirable, and inhibition of heme oxygenase is one possible approach to the treatment of this problem.

Two forms of heme oxygenase are known: HO-1, which is induced by a variety of agents and stress conditions and is found in highest concentration in the spleen and liver, and HO-2, which is not induced by xenobiotics and is found in highest concentration in the brain and testes (7Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M.

Müller R.M. Shibahara S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that a fully active truncated version of human HO-1 (hHO-1) lacking the 23 C-terminal amino acids that constitute the membrane anchor can be expressed in Escherichia coli in high yields (10Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A protein lacking the 26 N-terminal amino acids in which the last two amino acids have been mutated (S262R, S263L) has been independently expressed and shown to retain partial activity (11Ishikawa K. Sato M. Ito M. Yoshida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The heme oxygenase reaction proceeds via a multistep mechanism that depends on reduction equivalents provided by NADPH and P450 reductase. The first step of the reaction is thought to be the O2-dependent oxidation of heme to α-meso-hydroxyheme (Fig. 1). The principal experimental evidence for this intermediate is the finding that synthetic α-meso-hydroxyheme is converted to biliverdin IXα both by HO-1 (12Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. Sano S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Yoshinaga T. Sudo Y. Sano S. Biochem.

In the second step of the reaction, α-meso-hydroxyheme undergoes O2-dependent elimination of the hydroxylated α-meso-carbon as CO with the concomitant formation of verdoheme (Fig. 1). The involvement of α-meso-hydroxyheme rationalizes both the chemistry of the process and the finding that an atom of molecular oxygen is incorporated into the CO (18Tenhunen R. Marver H. Pimstone N.R. Trager W.F. Cooper D.Y. Schmid R. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1716-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Finally, in a reaction also catalyzed by HO-1, verdoheme is cleaved in an NADPH- and O2-dependent manner to give biliverdin (19Saito S. Itano H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1393-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Yoshida T. Noguchi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by HO-1 is highly regiospecific and only produces biliverdin IXα, the isomer resulting from hydroxylation and elimination of the α-meso-carbon (21Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The key role proposed for α-meso-hydroxylation in the oxidation of heme by HO-1 has led us to examine the oxidation of a heme in which the α-meso-position is blocked. We recently described the synthesis, isolation, and characterization of the α-, β-, γ-, and δ-meso-methyl derivatives of mesoheme (22Torpey J.W. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 2195-2199Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We report here that α-meso-methylmesoheme is oxidized to mesobiliverdin IXα despite the α-meso-methyl substituent. Furthermore, we have found that the regiochemistry of the oxidation reaction can be redirected by introduction of a methyl group at the γ- or δ-meso-positions. These results suggest an important role for electronic effects in controlling the reaction regiospecificity. Human HO-1 without the 23-amino acid membrane anchor (hHO-1) was expressed and purified as reported (10Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Mass spectra were obtained by (+)LSIMS on a VG-70 or Kratos Concept instrument using a 1:1 (1% trifluoroacetic acid) glycerol:thioglycerol matrix. Binding constants were obtained by adding increasing concentrations (0.32-5.12 μM) of the meso-methylmesoheme to a set of matched cuvettes, one containing 11.5 μM hHO-1 apoprotein and the other aqueous buffer, and determining the difference spectrum. The absorbance difference between the minimum and maximum wavelengths was plotted versus the meso-methylmesoheme concentration. Biphasic curves were obtained, and binding constants were determined by fitting a hyperbolic curve to the data for the initial phase. The second phase represents relatively weak, nonspecific binding to the protein. P450 reductase (12 μg, 0.15 nmol) and NADPH (100 nmol) were added to a 1-ml cuvette containing one of the meso-methylmesoheme·hHO-1 complexes (α = 0.43 mg, 14.3 nmol; β = 0.62 mg, 20.5 nmol; γ = 0.60 mg, 19.9 nmol; δ = 0.59 mg, 19.8 nmol) in 1 ml of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) presaturated with CO by bubbling with the gas. The progress of the reaction was followed by monitoring both the appearance of the Fe(II)mesoverdoheme-CO complex at λmax 616 nm and the loss of the Soret band of the starting complex. H2O2 (10 eq) was added to a cuvette containing one of the meso-methylmesoheme·hHO-1 complexes in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) (α = 0.58 mg, 19.3 nmol; β = 0.22 mg, 7.3 nmol; γ = 0.25 mg, 8.2 nmol; δ = 0.32 mg, 10.7 nmol; 1 ml final volume). The progress of the reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically by the appearance of the Fe(III)mesoverdoheme absorption at 600-700 nm and the decrease in the intensity of the Soret absorbance of the starting complex. A solution of mesoheme (2 mg, 3.2 μmol) in pyridine (20 ml) and deionized water (20 ml) was bubbled vigorously with O2 for 2 min, after which sodium ascorbate (500 mg, 2.5 mmol) was added, and the flask was stoppered and shaken for 5 min (25Bonnett R. McDonagh A.F. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1973; : 881-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Saito S. Itano H.A. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1986; : 1-7Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The bright green mixture was poured into CH2Cl2 (50 ml) and water (400 ml), and the organic phase was washed with water (400 ml) before it was concentrated under vacuum to give a syrupy residue (5 ml). One volume of MeOH was added and the solution was immediately purged with argon. While under argon, a saturated solution of KOH in MeOH (3 ml) was added, and the mixture was allowed to stand for 5 min before pouring it into 25% aqueous HCl (400 ml). The bluish-green solution was allowed to stir at 25°C for 10 min and was then extracted with CH2Cl2 (50 ml), washed with water (400 ml), and concentrated under vacuum. The mesobiliverdin regioisomers were analyzed by HPLC as reported below. P450 reductase (300 μg, 3.9 nmol) and NADPH (30 μmol) were added to a solution in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) of a meso-methylmesoheme·hHO-1 complex (α = 7.1 mg, 237 nmol; β = 5.3 mg, 178 nmol; γ = 6.7 mg, 222 nmol; δ = 7.6 mg, 254 nmol; final volume: α = 11.5 ml, β = 12.0 ml, γ = 10.5 ml, δ = 12.5 ml). The reactions were allowed to stand at 25°C for 1 h and were then extracted and analyzed as described below to give (α): λmax (CH3OH) 366, 636 nm; m/z (MH+) 587, calculated for C33H38O6N4 586; (γ): λmax (CH3OH) 366, 650 nm; m/z (MH+) 587, calculated for C33H38O6N4 586; (δ1): λmax (CH3OH) 322, 358, 570 nm; m/z (MH+) 601, calculated for C34H40O6N4 600; (δ2): λmax (CH3OH) 366, 610 nm; m/z (MH+) 587, calculated for C33H38O6N4 586. H2O2 (2 eq) was added to a solution of a meso-methylmesoheme·hHO-1 complex (γ = 4.3 mg, 143 nmol; δ = 6.8 mg, 227 nmol; final volume: γ = 7.0 ml, δ = 12.0 ml), and the reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically. The mixture was allowed to stand for 1 h at 25°C, after which no further changes in the spectrum were observed. P450 reductase (60 μg, 0.78 nmol) and NADPH (10 μmol) were then added, and the mixture was allowed to stand for 1 h before it was extracted and analyzed as described below to give (γ): λmax (CH3OH) 366, 650 nm; m/z (MH+) 587, calculated for C33H38O6N4 586; (δ1): λmax (CH3OH) 322, 358, 570 nm; m/z (MH+) 601, calculated for C34H40O6N4 600; (δ2): λmax (CH3OH) 366, 610 nm; m/z (MH+) 587, calculated for C33H38O6N4 586. Coupled oxidation with ascorbate was also carried out with each of the meso-methylmesoheme·hHO-1 complexes. To a solution of a meso-methylmesoheme·hHO-1 complex (α = 7.1 mg, 237 nmol; β = 5.3 mg, 178 nmol; γ = 6.7 mg, 222 nmol; δ = 7.6 mg, 254 nmol; final volume: α = 11.5 ml, β = 12.0 ml, γ = 10.5 ml, δ = 12.5 ml) was added sodium ascorbate (50 mg, 0.25 mmol). The solution was gently agitated to facilitate dissolution of the ascorbate. After 1 h at 25°C the reaction was extracted and analyzed as described below to give (α): λmax (CH3OH) 366, 636 nm; m/z (MH+) 587, calculated for C33H38O6N4 586; (γ): λmax (CH3OH) 366, 650 nm; m/z (MH+) 587, calculated for C33H38O6N4 586; (δ1): λmax (CH3OH) 322, 358, 570 nm; m/z (MH+) 601, calculated for C34H40O6N4 600; (δ2): λmax (CH3OH) 366, 610 nm; m/z (MH+) 587, calculated for C33H38O6N4 586. To each reaction mixture was added concentrated HCl (1 drop) and acetic acid (1 ml) before the solution was extracted with CH2Cl2 (100 ml). The organic phase was washed with brine (300 ml) and water (400 ml) and then concentrated under vacuum. The concentrate was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on a Whatman analytical (4.6 × 250 mm) Partisil 10-mm ODS-3 reverse-phase column eluted with 50:50 acetone, 0.1% aqueous formic acid at 0.6 ml/min. The eluent was monitored at 364 nm and referenced against 474 nm. To a 1-ml solution of mesoheme·hHO-1 complex (0.27 mg, 9.0 nmol) was added P450 reductase (0.24 mg, 3.1 nmol) and NADPH (100 nmol). The tube was immediately sealed with a rubber septum. After 5 min at 25°C the solution had turned green, and a freshly prepared solution of ferrous deoxymyoglobin (0.14 mg, 8 nmol) was injected via syringe through the septum. The solution was shaken, the septum removed, and the UV-visible spectrum recorded. This procedure was repeated with a 1-ml solution of the α-meso-methylmesoheme·hHO-1 complex (0.36 mg, 12.0 nmol). The ferrous deoxymyoglobin used to detect CO was prepared by adding sodium dithionite (5 mg) to a 2 ml solution of horse skeletal muscle myoglobin (0.27 mg, 16.0 nmol) in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). This ferrous deoxymyoglobin solution was split in two and subsequently added to one of the hHO-1 reaction mixtures. The dissociation constants for the binding of the meso-methylmesoheme regioisomers were determined by difference spectroscopy. The Kd values for the regioisomers are as follows: α, 1 ± 0.3 μM; β, 2 ± 0.5 μM; γ, 10 ± 1 μM; and δ, 6 ± 1 μM. These values are similar to the value for mesoheme, Kd = 4 ± 0.2 μM. The values are approximate due to the biphasic nature of the plots of absorbance difference versus substrate concentration. It is nevertheless clear that the binding affinities for the meso-methylmesohemes do not differ greatly from that for mesoheme, with the α-meso-methyl isomer binding most tightly and the γ-meso-methyl isomer least tightly. Reaction of the α-meso-methylmesoheme·hHO-1 complex with NADPH and P450 reductase under an atmosphere of O2 and CO results in loss of Soret intensity and the gradual accumulation of an intermediate with a distinct visible band at λmax = 616 nm (Fig. 2A). This intermediate is the Fe(II)mesoverdoheme-CO complex (12Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. Sano S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Lagarias J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 717: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The CO is included in the incubation to arrest the reaction at the mesoverdoheme stage, as the reaction otherwise proceeds directly to mesobiliverdin. The changes in the absorption spectrum due to the incubation of hHO-1 with the other three meso-methylmesoheme isomers are also shown in Fig. 2. Over the time course of each reaction (3-5 min), the Soret band red-shifts and decreases in intensity, and visible bands develop at λmax = 538 and 616 nm. These changes signal formation of the corresponding Fe(II)mesoverdoheme-CO complex. However, the amount of the Fe(II)mesoverdoheme-CO complex that is formed varies with the isomer, the β-methyl isomer giving the lowest spectroscopic conversion (Fig. 2B). Of course, the regiochemistries of the Fe(II)mesoverdoheme complexes that are obtained are not defined by these spectroscopic studies. Previous studies have shown that the oxidation of heme to verdoheme by hHO-1 can be supported by H2O2, although the conversion of verdoheme to biliverdin still requires P450 reductase and NADPH (10Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not necessary to run this reaction in the presence of CO because no reducing equivalents are present and the end product is Fe(III)mesoverdoheme. The meso-methyl-substituted hemes have been incubated with H2O2 to determine if it also supports their conversion to mesoverdohemes. The progress of the reactions of the four isomeric meso-methylmesoheme·hHO-1 complexes with a 10-fold excess of H2O2 has been monitored spectrophotometrically (Fig. 3). The earlier studies showed that the H2O2-dependent oxidation of heme to Fe(III)verdoheme results in decay of the Soret band and appearance of a broad absorption in the 600-700-nm range (10Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, incubation of α-meso-methylmesoheme with hHO-1 and H2O2 results in a peroxide concentration-dependent decay of the Soret band without the appearance of the 600-700-nm absorption (Fig. 3A). The same spectroscopic change was observed if the excess of H2O2 was increased from 10- to 100-fold. Incubation of the β-meso-methyl isomer led to a similar time-dependent decrease in the Soret band, but in this instance a small increase is observed in the 600-700-nm region (Fig. 3B). Incubation of the γ- and δ-meso-methylmesoheme isomers with hHO-1 and H2O2 gives the spectroscopic changes expected for clean conversion of both substrates to Fe(III)mesoverdohemes (Fig. 3). Thus, the δ- and γ-isomers appear to be converted to Fe(III)mesoverdohemes in good yields, but the α- and β-isomers are degraded without the formation, except for a trace in the case of the β-isomer, of mesoverdohemes. Coupled oxidation is the oxidation of heme to biliverdin promoted by ascorbate or other reducing agents (28Lemberg R. Lockwood W.H. Legge J.W. Biochem. J. 1941; 35: 363-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lemberg R. Legge J.W. Hematin Compounds and Bile Pigments. Interscience, New York1949: 453Google Scholar). Ascorbate specifically supports the conversion of the heme·hHO-1 complex to biliverdin IXα (30Ito-Maki M. Ishikawa K. Matera K.M. Sato M. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). 2A. Wilks, J. Torpey, and P. R. Ortiz de Montellano, unpublished results. Coupled oxidation of the meso-methylmesoheme·hHO-1 complexes has been examined to determine whether it exhibits a regiospecificity pattern similar to that of the reactions mediated by NADPH/P450 reductase and H2O2. The reaction was monitored by chromatographic and spectroscopic analysis of the mesobiliverdin products. To facilitate the identification of the mesobiliverdin isomers, a regioisomer mixture was obtained by coupled oxidation of mesoheme in pyridine:water (Fig. 4B). The regiospecificity of the oxidation of each of the meso-methylmesohemes by hHO-1 was examined with the three oxidizing systems NADPH/P450 reductase, H2O2, and ascorbate. The incubations with NADPH and P450 reductase were carried out in the absence of exogenous CO, and the Fe(III)mesoverdoheme·hHO-1 complexes obtained with H2O2 were incubated with NADPH and P450 reductase prior to chromatographic analysis to convert the mesoverdohemes to mesobiliverdins. The products were analyzed by HPLC, absorption spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. The HPLC system reliably separates the four biliverdin regioisomers derived from heme, and the methyl-substituted from the unsubstituted mesobiliverdins, but only partially separates the mesobiliverdin regioisomers from each other. Oxidation of α-meso-methylmesoheme by both NADPH-P450 reductase and ascorbate results in regiospecific oxidation of the α-meso-position to give mesobiliverdin IXα (Fig. 4A), the product also obtained from mesoheme. The identity of this product is confirmed by the congruence of its absorption spectrum, HPLC retention time, and mass spectrum with that of authentic mesobiliverdin IXα (Table I). These results, but most particularly the absence of an extra methyl group in the mass spectrum, establish that the α-meso-carbon and the appended methyl group have been eliminated. In contrast to the reactions supported by NADPH-P450 reductase or ascorbic acid, the H2O2-dependent oxidation of α-meso-methylmesoheme by hHO-1 results in degradation of the substrate but does not produce a spectroscopically detectable Fe(III)mesoverdoheme intermediate (Fig. 3A) or a mesobiliverdin product.Table I.Absorption spectra and molecular ions of the products from the hHO-1-catalyzed oxidation of the meso-methylmesoheme isomers supported by different oxidizing agentsAbsorption spectrum of product(s) (in CH3OH)NADPH P450 reductaseH2O2aAfter further reaction of the H2O2 product with NADPH and cytochrome P450 reductase.Ascorbatenmm/zm/zm/zα-Methyl366, 636586NRbNR indicates reaction gives insufficient mesobiliverdin isomers for definitive characterization.586β-MethylNRbNR indicates reaction gives insufficient mesobiliverdin isomers for definitive characterization.NRbNR indicates reaction gives insufficient mesobiliverdin isomers for definitive characterization.NRbNR indicates reaction gives insufficient mesobiliverdin isomers for definitive characterization.γ-Methyl366, 650586586586δ-Methyl322, 358, 570600600600366, 610586586586a After further reaction of the H2O2 product with NADPH and cytochrome P450 reductase.b NR indicates reaction gives insufficient mesobiliverdin isomers for definitive characterization. Open table in a new tab The hHO-1-catalyzed oxidation of γ-meso-methylmesoheme is well behaved. A single mesobiliverdin isomer (Fig. 4D) is obtained with all three oxidizing systems, including H2O2 (Table I). Identification of this isomer as mesobiliverdin IXγ is based on its mesobiliverdin-like spectrum, an HPLC retention time similar to that of one of the isomers derived from mesoheme, and the mass spectrometric molecular ion (m/z 586) of an unsubstituted mesobiliverdin. The hHO-1-catalyzed oxidation of γ-meso-methylmesoheme in all three oxidizing systems thus leads to elimination of the γ-meso-carbon and the attached methyl group. The hHO-1-catalyzed oxidation of the β- and δ-meso-methylmesoheme isomers is more complicated than that of the α- or γ-isomers. The oxidation of the δ-isomer supported by all three oxidizing systems produces a mixture of mesobiliverdin products (Fig. 4C, Table I). The chromatographic resolution does not allow us to determine whether the product ratio is the same in the three systems. Nevertheless, one of the partially resolved HPLC peaks has the molecular ion at m/z 586 of an unsubstituted mesobiliverdin and is thus mesobiliverdin IXδ (Table I). The other peak, which consists of at least two isomers, has a molecular ion at m/z 600 and thus corresponds to a mixture of two methyl-substituted mesobiliverdin isomers. The hHO-1 catalyzed oxidation of β-meso-methylmesoheme supported by all three oxidizing systems rapidly degrades the heme chromophore but yields mesobiliverdin products in amounts too small for mass spectrometric characterization. An assay based on the affinity of ferrous deoxymyoglobin for CO was used to detect the formation of CO in the NADPH/P450 reductase-supported reactions of hHO-1 with mesoheme and α-meso-methylmesoheme. The assay is based on the shift of the Soret maximum of ferrous deoxymyoglobin (λmax 434 nm) on complexation with CO (λmax 422 nm). Addition of deoxymyoglobin (Fig. 5, trace a) to the mesoheme-hHO-1 reaction mixture after completion of the reaction resulted in immediate formation of the ferrous myoglobin-CO complex (Fig. 5, trace b). No detectable shift of the deoxymyoglobin Soret maximum was observed when the identical experiment was carried out with the α-meso-methylmesoheme·hHO-1 complex (not shown). Thus, CO is not detectably formed in the reaction of α-meso-methylmesoheme with hHO-1 under conditions where it is easily detected in the corresponding reaction with mesoheme. The first major finding of this study is that α-meso-methylmesoheme, like mesoheme, is efficiently and regiospecifically oxidized by hHO-1 to mesobiliverdin IXα (Fig. 4A, Table I). This finding is unexpected because the first step in the heme oxygenase reaction is thought to be α-meso-hydroxylation of the heme, a transformation that is blocked by the methyl substituent. The primary evidence for α-meso hydroxylation is the finding that synthetic α-meso-hydroxyhemes are converted to the corresponding biliverdins by HO-1 (12Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. Sano S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Yoshinaga T. Sudo Y. Sano S. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 31Matera K.M.

Indeed, even in the absence of HO-1, autoxidation of α-meso-hydroxymesoheme produces mesoverdoheme and/or mesobiliverdin products (14Jackson A.H. Kenner G.W. Smith K.M. J. Chem. Soc. (Lond.). 1968; : 302-310Google Scholar, 15Sano S. Sano T. Morishima I. Shiro Y Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Morishima I.

I. 1987; : 1063-1067Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The formation of α-meso-hydroxyheme in the HO-1-catalyzed reaction has not been reported, although spectroscopic evidence for its formation has been obtained. 3Y. Liu and P. R. Ortiz de Montellano, unpublished data. In any case, the oxidation of α-meso-methylmesoheme to mesobiliverdin IXα via α-meso-hydroxylation is not possible unless the methyl group is first removed. This does not occur, however, because CO is not produced in the hHO-1-catalyzed oxidation of α-meso-methylmesoheme under conditions that readily produce CO from mesoheme (Fig. 5). This finding rules out oxidation of the α-meso-methyl derivative by any mechanism that implicates the α-meso-hydroxy species as an intermediate. In view of the above, α-meso-hydroxylation is either not a step in the normal catalytic process or, more likely, the oxidation of α-meso-methylmesoheme to mesoverdoheme IXα occurs by a distinct (nonphysiological) mechanism. The finding that H2O2 does not support the hHO-1-catalyzed oxidation of α-meso-methylmesoheme to mesoverdoheme IXα suggests that the oxidation of meso-methylated and unmethylated substrates diverges early in the catalytic sequence. The first two intermediates in the normal reaction are the ferrous heme and ferrous dioxy heme complexes, neither of which is accessible in the H2O2-supported reaction. Reduction of the ferrous dioxy heme in the third catalytic step produces a complex formally similar to that obtained when H2O2 binds to the ferric heme. The two ferric peroxide species are unlikely to differ in other than possibly the degree of protonation of the distal oxygen. It is therefore possible that successful oxidation of the α-meso-methyl substrate by NADPH-P450 reductase but not H2O2 is due to divergence of the two reactions prior to formation of the ferric peroxide complex. This possibility is ruled out by the fact that NADPH-P450 reductase and H2O2 support the regiospecific hHO-1-catalyzed oxidation of γ-meso-methylmesoheme to mesobiliverdin IXγ and mesoverdoheme IXγ, respectively. It is not clear why both oxidizing systems work well for the γ-meso-methyl derivative but only NADPH-P450 reductase works with the α-meso-methyl isomer. Nevertheless, the fact that both reactions work for the γ-regioisomer shows that the difference is not due to early intermediates of the pathway not accessible with H2O2. The abnormal degradation of α-meso-methylmesoheme by hHO-1 and H2O2 may stem from reaction of a reaction intermediate with a second molecule of H2O2. A second major finding of this study is that the regiospecificity of the HO-1-catalyzed reaction can be redirected by meso-methyl substitution. This is best illustrated by the finding that γ-meso-methylmesoheme is regiospecifically oxidized by hHO-1 to mesobiliverdin IXγ (Fig. 4D, Table I). This is highly surprising because oxidation at the methyl-substituted γ-carbon occurs despite the presence of a normal, unsubstituted α-position! The same regiospecificity is observed whether the oxidation is supported by NADPH-P450 reductase, H2O2, or ascorbate (Table I). All previous work indicates that HO-1 regiospecifically oxidizes hemes at the α-meso-position. Indeed, it has been reported that HO-1 presented with β-, γ-, and δ-meso-hydroxyhemes does not produce biliverdins in more than trace amounts, either because the corresponding verdohemes are not formed or are not oxidized further (13Yoshinaga T. Sudo Y. Sano S. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The basis for the regiospecificity of HO-1 is not known, but the regiochemistry of the coupled oxidation of the heme in sperm whale myoglobin and human hemoglobin has led to the proposal that the reaction regiospecificity is controlled by steric orientation of the ferrous dioxygen complex (32Brown S.B. Chabot A.A. Enderby E.A. North A.C.T. Nature. 1981; 289: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The present results are inconsistent with such a steric control mechanism. Although meso-methyl substitution causes ruffling of the porphyrin ring (33Senge M.O. Ema T. Smith K.M. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1995; : 733-734Crossref Google Scholar, 34Medforth C.J. Senge M.O. Smith K.M. Sparks L.D. Shelnutt J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 9859-9869Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar), it is highly unlikely that γ-meso-methyl substitution could so alter the steric interactions as to produce a clean 180° inversion in the reaction regiospecificity. Although steric steering may play some role, the meso-methylmesoheme results suggest that electronic effects play a dominant role in controlling the HO-1 regiospecificity. Thus, electron donation by a methyl substituent, possibly strengthened by ruffling of the porphyrin, should enhance the reactivity of the substituted meso- position. Two independent pieces of evidence support such a mechanism. First, studies of the ethylhydroperoxide-dependent oxidation of heme by hHO-1 suggest that the oxygen adds electrophilically to the α-meso-position (35Wilks A. Torpey J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29553-29556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron donating substituents should therefore, as observed, facilitate reaction at the substituted position. Second, the 1H NMR spectrum of the hHO-1·heme complex provides evidence for a distinctive distribution of electron density in the highest occupied porphyrin molecular orbital. This electron distribution is seen when electron donating or withdrawing substituents are placed on the meso-carbons of the porphyrin (36Herná;ndez G. Wilks A. Paolesse R. Smith K.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. La Mar G.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This finding has led to the proposal that the HO-1 protein perturbs the heme electronic distribution to favor α-meso-hydroxylation. Additional support for electronic control of the reaction regiochemistry is provided by the lower regiospecificity of the hHO-1-catalyzed oxidation of β- and δ-meso-methylmesoheme (Fig. 4C, Table I). In particular, oxidation of the δ-isomer proceeds with mixed regiochemistry to give both mesobiliverdin IXδ and mesobiliverdins that retain the δ-methyl group (Table I). The products with the methyl group probably derive from oxidation of the heme at the α- and γ-positions, since oxidation of the β-position gives very low yields of biliverdin products. This lower reaction regiospecificity may reflect a competition between the protein-mediated electronic effects that promote reaction at the α-meso-position and the conflicting enrichment by the methyl group of electron density at the δ-meso-position. A comparable conflict in the reaction regiochemistry is not observed when the methyl is at the γ-meso-position because electronic perturbations of the type suggested by the hHO-1 NMR spectrum are symmetry-related (36Herná;ndez G. Wilks A. Paolesse R. Smith K.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. La Mar G.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 37Tan H. Simonis U. Shokhirev N.V. Walker F.A. J. Am.

That is, meso-positions opposite to each other with respect to the iron are similarly affected by meso-substitutions, although the magnitude of the effect at the two sites differs. The α- and γ-positions, and the β- and δ-positions, should therefore be paired in their response to meso-substitution. In this correlation, it is clear that the β-meso-position is unique in that its oxidation by hHO-1 primarily yields products other than mesoverdoheme (or mesobiliverdin) whether it is methyl-substituted or not. The abnormal β-meso reactivity is of further interest because NMR studies show that heme is bound in the hHO-1 active site in two orientations related to each other by a 180° rotation about the α-γ axis. This rotation exchanges the β- and δ-meso-carbons (36Herná;ndez G. Wilks A. Paolesse R. Smith K.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. La Mar G.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The heme was found in approximately a 1:1 distribution between the two orientations. If a similar binding heterogeneity exists for β-meso-methylmesoheme, the β-methyl should be located partially in the “β-site” and partially in “δ-site.” As the δ-meso-methyl isomer is readily oxidized, one might expect that the fraction of the β-meso-methyl isomer with the β-meso-carbon in the δ-site should be similarly oxidized. Indeed, it is possible that the small extent to which the β-meso-methyl isomer is oxidized to a mesobiliverdin may reflect the proportion of the substrate bound in the “inverted” orientation. As the earlier NMR evidence showed that the ratio of the binding orientations is sensitive to the nature of the 2,4-substituents on the porphyrin (36Herná;ndez G. Wilks A. Paolesse R. Smith K.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. La Mar G.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), it is plausible that β-meso-methylmesoheme binds primarily in an unproductive orientation and only to a small extent in the productive inverted orientation. In sum, the present studies demonstrate that meso-hydroxylation is not absolutely required for the HO-1-catalyzed cleavage of heme groups and establish that the regiospecificity of the enzymatic reaction is more influenced by electronic than steric factors. The finding that the same regioselectivity is observed whether the reaction is supported by NADPH-P450 reductase, H2O2, or ascorbate strengthens the conclusion that the factors that determine the regiospecificity are not related to the oxygen activation mechanism but are inherent to the binding of the heme in the active site. Detailed mechanistic studies currently in progress, including efforts to determine the fate of the two carbons removed from the substrate in the oxidative reaction, should further clarify both the mechanism of the reaction by which the methyl-substituted meso-carbon is excised and the relationship of this reaction to the normal catalytic turnover of HO-1.

We used intact human platelets to determine whether α subunits of both G-proteins can be phosphorylated under physiological conditions. Activation of human platelets by thrombin and the thromboxane A2 receptor agonist U46619 lead to phosphorylation of Gα12 and Gα13. Phosphorylation occurred rapidly after addition of thrombin and was not mediated by glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (integrin αIIbβ3) activation.

The phosphorylation of both G protein α subunits was reconstituted in COS-7 cells cotransfected with Gα12 or Gα13 and different protein kinase C isoforms.

Heterotrimeric G-proteins consist of an α-subunit which binds and hydrolyzes GTP, a β- and a γ-subunit. The identity of the G-protein α-subunit defines the heterotrimeric G-protein. Based on sequence and functional homologies the α-subunits can be divided into four families (Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq, and Gα12) (5Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). In a given cell, several signal transduction pathways involving different heterotrimeric G-proteins operate in parallel, and there is increasing evidence that the G-protein mediated signal transduction system undergoes adaptation and cross-regulation at many different levels. Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is an important regulatory mechanism found in a variety of signal transduction systems. Several reports have shown that the α-subunits of some members of the Gi/o family can be phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro. In platelets, thrombin, thromboxane A2 analogs, and phorbol esters lead to a protein kinase C mediated phosphorylation of Gαz (6Lounsbury K.M. Casey P.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

In addition, several reports have shown that Gαi can be phosphorylated in various systems under conditions leading to protein kinase C and cGMP dependent protein kinase activation (9Katada T.

A. 1991; 88: 5582-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Studies using constitutively activated forms of both α-subunits have provided evidence that G12 and G13 are involved in the regulation of different downstream effectors and signaling pathways, e.g. the Na+/H+exchanger (14Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.

However, the effectors directly regulated by G12 and G13 are currently unknown. It is clear that both G-proteins are distinct from most other G-proteins with regard to the biochemical properties of their α-subunits. The receptor-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange rate of G12 and G13 is very low when measured in membrane fractions (19Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), and purified Gα12 and Gα13 exhibit very slow rates of GDP dissociation and GTP association (20Singer D.W. Miller T.R.

Platelets are a well described model system for studies of G-protein mediated signal transduction processes. In human platelet membranes both, Gα12 and Gα13, have been shown to be activated through thrombin and thromboxane A2 receptors (19Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We therefore chose intact human platelets to test whether Gα12 and Gα13 can be phosphorylated under in vivo conditions. Our data show that treatment of human platelets with physiological platelet activators leads to a rapid and sustained phosphorylation of both G-protein α-subunits and that this phosphorylation is mediated by protein kinase C. Thrombin, thrombin receptor peptide (SFLLRNPNDKYEPF), U46619, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), protein A-Sepharose, and Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) were from Sigma. Calphostin C was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and [32P]orthophosphate was from DuPont NEN. Anti-Gα12 and -Gα13 antisera were raised against peptides representing the carboxyl-terminal 10 amino acids of Gα12 and Gα13, respectively. The cDNAs of Gα12 and Gα13 were carried by the cytomegalovirus promotor containing vector pCIS. A β-galactosidase construct inserted into pCIS was used as a transfection control. The PKCα, βI, δ, ϵ, and ζ cDNAs were in the expression vector pMT2, and the cDNA of PKCη was carried by pKSI (22Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. McIntyre P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Venous blood was collected from healthy drug-free volunteers and anticoagulated with 6 mM citric acid, 12 mM sodium citrate. Platelet isolation was carried out at room temperature. Platelet rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation of whole blood for 20 min at 200 × g. Platelet rich plasma was adjusted with citrate buffer to pH 6.5 and centrifuged two times at 200 × g for 15 min to remove contaminating cells. Thereafter, platelets were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 700 × g and washed once in buffer A containing 138 mM NaCl, 6 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM NaHCO3, 5.5 mM glucose, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.5 unit/ml apyrase, and 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4). Platelets were metabolically labeled by incubation in the above buffer containing 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h at room temperature. Metabolically labeled platelets were washed once in buffer A (see above) and about 2 × 109 platelets were preincubated for 3 min at 37°C in 200 μl of the same buffer devoid of apyrase and containing 1 mM CaCl2. Incubation was initiated by addition of indicated agents (10 μl) and was stopped by adding 50 μl of 5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 50 mM Na4P2O7. After 10 min at room temperature, 1 ml of precipitating buffer (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1% (w/v) desoxycholate, 0.5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 5 mM Na4P2O7, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.4)) was added, and lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 12000 × g. Thereafter, supernatants were precleared by incubation with 50 μl of 12.5% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4°C at constant rotation. Sepharose beads were pelleted and supernatants were incubated for another 1-1.5 h in the presence of 10 μl antiserum. After addition of 50 μl of 12.5% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose beads samples were incubated for 1 h at 4°C, and immunocomplexes were washed and prepared for SDS-PAGE as described (19Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were cultured as described (23Wu D. Katz A. Lee C.-H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25798-25802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For transfection experiments, cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well and grown overnight. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline solution and 1 μg of plasmid DNA mixed with 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM was added to each well. In control experiments, the total amount of DNA was maintained constant by adding DNA from a vector encoding β-galactosidase. After 5 h, 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum was added, and cells were used for experiments about 45 h later. For metabolic labeling, cells were washed 3 times with DMEM devoid of phosphate. Thereafter cells were incubated for 2 h in 0.4 ml phosphate-free DMEM containing 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate and 20 mM Hepes·NaOH (pH 7.4). Cells were then washed once with phosphate-free DMEM and incubated in the absence or presence of the indicated agents at 37°C. Reactions were stopped by removing incubation medium and adding of 100 μl of 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaF, 10 mM Na4P2O7. Immunoprecipitation of proteins was done as described above. Transfected COS-7 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Phosphorylation was initiated by adding 0.5 ml of permeabilization solution consisting of 115 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Hepes·NaOH (pH 7), 1 mM EGTA, 100 μM [γ-32P]ATP (100 mCi/mmol), 50 μM each of PKC substrate peptides A and B, 20 μM digitonin, and 0.72 mM CaCl2 (to give a free Ca2+ concentration of 500 nM) (24Schubert R. Comput. Methods Programs Biomed. 1990; 33: 93-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nM PMA for 10 min at 37°C. 400 μl of the supernatant were then spotted onto phosphocellulose paper (Whatman P81) and dried. Filter papers were washed five times in 30% (v/v) acetic acid and counted. PKC substrate peptides A and B represent the pseudosubstrate sites of PKCζ (IYRRGSRRLRKL) and PKCδ (MNRRGSIKQAKI) except for the substitution of serine in place of alanine. Human platelets metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate were incubated with different agents which lead to the inhibition or activation of platelet function, platelet lysates were prepared, and Gα12 and Gα13 were then immunoprecipitated from the lysates with specific antisera. No radioactive phosphate was found in Gα12 and Gα13 immunoprecipitated from untreated platelets or platelets incubated in the presence of the PGI2 receptor agonist cicaprost, forskolin, or sodium nitroprusside (data not shown). However, treatment of platelets with the platelet activators thrombin and thromboxane A2 analogue U46619 as well as with the phorbol ester PMA resulted in a marked phosphorylation of Gα12 and Gα13 (Fig. 1). Thombin receptor peptide mimicked the effect of thrombin, demonstrating the specific activation of the G-protein coupled thrombin receptor. The extent of phosphorylation induced by U46619 and thrombin receptor peptide was lower than that promoted by PMA and thrombin. To confirm the specificity of the antisera used for immunoprecipitation, the anti-Gα12 and anti-Gα13 antisera were preincubated with the individual peptides against which they were raised. Fig. 2 shows that immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated 42-kDa proteins by anti-Gα12 and anti-Gα13 antisera was blocked by the respective peptides. There was no cross-reactivity between both antisera as the Gα12 peptide was unable to block precipitation by the Gα13 antiserum and the Gα13 peptide had no effect on the precipitation by the Gα12 antiserum. No phosphorylated protein was precipitated by preimmune sera (Fig. 2). Similarly and in agreement with previous studies (7Lounsbury K.M. Schlegel B. Poncz M. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3494-3498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), immunoprecipitation with an antiserum recognizing the C terminus of Gαq/11 did not precipitate any phosphorylated Gαq/11 from lysates of platelets treated with different agents (data not shown). Time course experiments revealed a rapid and sustained phosphorylation of Gα12 and Gα13 in response to thrombin (Fig. 3). Phosphorylation of both proteins was maximal 10 s after addition of thrombin, whereas phosphorylation in response to PMA was maximal not earlier than 2 min after PMA was added. To rule out that phosphorylation of both proteins was dependent on activation of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (integrin αIIbβ3) we incubated platelets with the peptide RGDS prior to addition of thrombin (Fig. 4). Pretreatment of platelets with RGDS, an inhibitor of αIIbβ3-fibrinogen binding, had no effect on the thrombin induced phosphorylation of Gα12 and Gα13, whereas it prevented formation of a platelet aggregate which was usually visible about 3-4 min after addition of thrombin. Thus, thrombin induced Gα12 and Gα13 phosphorylation is an event occurring early during platelet activation. Since the effect of thrombin was mimicked by the protein kinase C activating phorbol ester PMA and since platelet activation is known to involve activation of protein kinase C (25Baldassare J.J. Henderson P.A. Burns D. Loomis C. Fisher G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15585-15590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Khan W.A. Blobe G. Halpern A. Taylor W. Wetsel W.C. Burns D.

Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of PKC in Gα12 and Gα13 phosphorylation. Fig. 4 shows that the effects of thrombin and PMA, both employed at maximally effective concentrations were not additive, suggesting that both agents acted through at least similar mechanisms involving the phosphorylation of the same residues. Calphostin C, a potent inhibitor of diacylglycerol and Ca2+-dependent isoforms of protein kinase C (28Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) inhibited the effect of thrombin on the phosphorylation of Gα12 and Gα13 in a concentration dependent manner in human platelets (Fig. 5), indicating that protein kinase C is involved in the thrombin dependent phosphorylation of Gα12 and Gα13. To further elucidate the mechanism of Gα12/Gα13 phosphorylation and to study the possible involvement of specific protein kinase C isoforms, we tried to reconstitute the protein kinase C dependent phosphorylation of both G-protein α-subunits in COS-7 cells. Fig. 6 shows that expression of different protein kinase C isoforms in COS-7 cells resulted in increased basal protein kinase C activity measured in permeabilized cells using PKC substrate peptides. Incubation of cells with the phorbol ester PMA increased the protein kinase C activity in cells expressing the protein kinase C isoforms α, β, δ, ϵ, and η, whereas the kinase activity in cells transfected with the atypical PKC isoform ζ was unresponsive to PMA. These data show that protein kinase C isoforms expressed in COS-7 cells were functionally active. We then coexpressed individual PKC isoforms and Gα12 or Gα13 and measured the phosphorylation of both G-protein α-subunits in response to PMA (Fig. 7). In metabolically labeled COS-7 cells transfected only with a control plasmid encoding β-galactosidase and incubated in the presence of PMA, no phosphorylated Gα12 or Gα13 was immunoprecipitated, whereas in cells transfected with Gα12 or Gα13, PMA induced the phosphorylation of both proteins presumably through the activation of endogenous protein kinase C. This PMA-induced phosphorylation of Gα12 as well as of Gα13 was unchanged in cells coexpressing the PKC isoforms α and η, indicating that these PKC isoforms were unable to mediate the effect of PMA on phosphorylation of Gα12 and Gα13 in our cotransfection system. However, in cells cotransfected with PKCβ, δ, or ϵ and Gα12 or Gα13 PMA-induced phosphorylation of each G-protein α-subunit was increased compared to cells transfected only with the Gα-subunit. The amount of Gα12 and Gα13 expressed in different cotransfected cells was the same when tested by Western blotting of cell lysates (data not shown). Quantification of radioactivity incorporated into Gα12 and Gα13 by using the PhosphorImager showed that PMA stimulated phosphorylation about 4.5-fold in cells expressing PKCβ compared to control cells, whereas PMA stimulated phosphorylation of Gα12 and Gα13 in cells cotransfected with PKCδ and ϵ was slightly lower (2-3.5-fold). These data demonstrate that the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Gα12 and Gα13 observed in human platelets can be reconstituted by cotransfection of different PKC isoforms and both G-protein α-subunits in COS-7 cells. The object of this study was to test whether members of the Gα12 family can be phosphorylated under physiological conditions. Human platelets were used as an experimental system since they contain both Gα12 and Gα13 as well as a variety of well described signaling pathways. We demonstrate that in human platelets both Gα12 and Gα13 undergo phosphorylation in response to the platelet activators thrombin and thromboxane A2. Phosphorylation occurred independent of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (integrin αIIbβ3) activation and was maximal within seconds after addition of thrombin to platelets, indicating that it is an event occurring during the first phase of platelet activation. Phosphorylation of Gα12 and Gα13 could also be observed after addition of phorbol ester PMA, and thrombin induced phosphorylation was blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C, strongly suggesting that phosphorylation of both G-proteins involves protein kinase C. PKC activation can be observed very early after activation of platelets by thrombin and is thought to play an important role in agonist stimulated activation of platelets (25Baldassare J.J. Henderson P.A. Burns D. Loomis C. Fisher G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15585-15590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Khan W.A. Blobe G. Halpern A. Taylor W. Wetsel W.C. Burns D.

Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Several PKC isoforms have been described in platelets including isoforms α, β, δ, and ζ (25Baldassare J.J. Henderson P.A. Burns D. Loomis C. Fisher G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15585-15590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Khan W.A. Blobe G. Halpern A. Taylor W. Wetsel W.C. Burns D.

It was demonstrated that thrombin induces a very rapid rise in diacylglycerol levels followed by a sustained translocation of PKCα, β, and ζ from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction of platelets (24Schubert R. Comput. Methods Programs Biomed. 1990; 33: 93-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Both the thrombin induced diacylglycerol generation as well as the translocation of PKC isoforms were independent of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa activation (24Schubert R. Comput. Methods Programs Biomed. 1990; 33: 93-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, this rapid activation of PKC can well account for the phosphorylation of Gα12 and Gα13 in platelets. The PKC isoform β is a good candidate for mediating the phosphorylation of Gα12 and Gα13 as seen in COS-7 cells cotransfected with PKCβ and Gα12 or Gα13, addition of PMA led to a very efficient phosphorylation of both G-proteins compared to control cells. It is, however, not clear whether PKC directly phosphorylates Gα12 and Gα13 or whether phosphorylation occurs through another yet unknown process involving PKC. Gα12/13 phosphorylation in activated platelets bears some resemblance to the phosphorylation of Gαz in platelets (6Lounsbury K.M. Casey P.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22051-22056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lounsbury K.M. Schlegel B. Poncz M. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3494-3498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gαz was shown to be the substrate of PKC and the primary site of phosphorylation has been mapped to Ser27 of Gαz whereas Ser16 serves as a secondary site for PKC phosphorylation. Ser27 and Ser16 are situated in the N-terminal region of the α-subunit which makes contact with Gβγ (31Rens-Domiano S. Hamm H. FASEB J.l. 1995; 9: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and biochemical evidence has been provided that phosphorylation of Gαz by PKC blocks interaction with Gβγ (8Fields T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23119-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of Gαz and its phosphorylation remains obscure. In analogy to Gαz we mutagenized Ser31 of Gα13 which corresponds to Ser16 in Gαz as well as Ser39 of Gα13 which also lies in the domain which is thought to contact Gβγ. Both the single mutants as well as the double mutant were, however, still phosphorylated in response to phorbol esters when expressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown), indicating that phosphorylation of Gα13 occurs at different residues and that the functional consequences of Gα13 phosphorylation are probably different from those of Gαz phosphorylation. G12 and G13 have been shown to be activated via thrombin and thromboxane A2 receptors in human platelet membranes (19Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), suggesting that both G-proteins are involved in the activation of platelets. Interestingly, both receptors as shown in the present study induce phosphorylation of both G-protein α-subunits in intact human platelets. Both receptors also activate Gq family members leading to the activation of PLCβ and the subsequent rise in [Ca2+]i and PKC activation. Thus, it is possible that thrombin and thromboxane A2 induced Gα12/13 phosphorylation in platelets results from activation of PLCβ by Gαq representing “cross-talk” between the Gq/PLCβ pathway and G12/13. Constitutively active mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 were recently shown to stimulate stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly through the small guanine nucleotide binding protein Rho in Swiss 3T3 cells, whereas activated forms of Gαq or Gαi2 had no effect (18Buhl A.M. Johnson M.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Aggregation of platelets in response to thrombin has been found to be inhibited by Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzym, which ADP-ribosylated and inhibits Rho (32Morii N. Teru-uchi T. Tominaga T. Kumagai N. Kozaki S. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20921-20926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, mediating the activation of Rho in platelets exposed to thrombin is a possible function of Gα12 and Gα13. A striking feature of Gα12 and Gα13 studied in purified form is their low rate of guanine nucleotide turnover (20Singer D.W. Miller T.R. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19796-19802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Similarly, both α-subunits showed a very slow rate of GTP binding in platelet membranes; GTP binding stimulated through the thromboxane A2 and thrombin receptor reached a maximum only after 30 min (19Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This guanine nucleotide exchange rate seems to be far to slow to allow Gα12 and Gα13 to play a significant role during platelet activation which takes place within a few minutes. There might be mechanisms leading to a faster activation of G12 and G13 which eluded experimental analysis in cell free systems. It is tempting to speculate that the rapid phosphorylation of Gα12 and Gα13 we observed in activated platelets may be part of a mechanism which leads to a faster activation of G12/13 and triggers or sustains their function in platelet activation. Taken together, we provide evidence that Gα12 and Gα13 are rapidly phosphorylated in activated platelets in a PKC-dependent manner and that this in vivo phosphorylation can be reconstituted in a cotransfected system. Once, the effector function directly regulated by G-proteins of the Gα12 family has been characterized, the effect of PKC-mediated phosphorylation on G12/13 signaling can be determined. We thank Dr. Peter Parker for providing expression plasmids of PKC isoforms and Dr. Thomas Wieland for critical reading of the manuscript. Recently, Kozasa and Gilman (33Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12562-12567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) showed that purified Gα12 can be phosphorylated by PKCα in vitro."

Shc contains two phosphotyrosine binding domains, an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain in the carboxyl terminus of the protein and a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain in the amino terminus. Since functional roles for these two domains have not been established, we microinjected glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins of either the Shc PTB or SH2 domains into fibroblasts expressing insulin and epidermal growth factor receptors and measured their effects on DNA synthesis. We found that the Shc PTB was necessary for insulin-induced mitogenic signaling, whereas the SH2 domain was not.

In principle, this can be the consequence of actual retention in this organelle or of retrieval from the Golgi. To determine which of the two mechanisms underlies the cysteine-dependent ER localization, we analyze here the post-translational modifications of suitably engineered cathepsin D (CD) molecules. The glycans of this protease are phosphorylated by post-ER phosphotransferases and further modified in the trans-Golgi to generate a mannose 6-phosphate lysosome targeting signal. Only trace amounts of the μtp-tagged CD (CDMμtpCys) are phosphorylated, unless retention is reversed by exogenous reducing agents or the critical cysteine mutated (CDMμtpSer). In contrast, a KDEL-tagged CD, that is retrieved from the Golgi into the ER, acquires phosphates, though mainly resistant to alkaline phosphatase. Similarly to CDMμtpSer, the few CDMμtpCys molecules that escape retention and acquire phosphates in the cis-Golgi are transported beyond the KDEL retrieval compartment, as indicated by their sensitivity to alkaline phosphatase.

Transmembrane and lumenal proteins of the central vacuolar system can achieve their localization in a given organelle either by retention or by retrieval from downstream compartments (reviewed in 1Luzio J.P.

Thus, resident lumenal proteins marked by a KDEL motif are recognized by a receptor in the Golgi and shuttled back to the ER (5Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.

Studies on immunoglobulins (Ig) revealed that the recognition of exposed thiols on unassembled molecules is one of the mechanisms that restrict secretion to structurally mature cargo proteins (7Fra A.M.

Immunol. 1996; 33: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Retention of Ig-λ chains in the ER is mediated by their COOH-terminal cysteine and correlates with the formation of disulfide bonds with numerous resident proteins, including ERp72 and PDI (11Reddy P. Sparvoli A. Fagioli C. Fassina G. Sitia R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2077-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, whether thiol-dependent quality control mechanisms act by causing recycling from the Golgi or by determining actual retention in the ER is still unclear. To address this issue, we have utilized chimeric human cathepsin D (CD) molecules, in which either the KDEL motif or the carboxyl-terminal 20 amino acids of the IgM heavy chain μ (the μ tailpiece, μtp) had been appended to the Myc-tagged lysosomal protease (7Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The μtp is sufficient to cause localization in the ER if the cysteine residue in the penultimate position is present (7Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 13Sitia R. Neuberger M. Alberini C. Bet P. Fra A. Valetti C. Williams G. Milstein C. Cell. 1990; 60: 781-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The well known stepwise processing of CD (for review, see 14Hasilik A. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 130-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) makes this protease a useful reporter to study the interorganelle trafficking. Human CD is synthesized as a diglycosylated precursor of approximately 53 kDa. Upon exit from the ER, mannose groups are phosphorylated by transfer of a N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate (P-GlcNAc) moiety operated by lysosomal-enzyme phosphotransferases. In the cis-Golgi, and possibly also within the intermediate compartment (for review, see 15Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar), phosphotransferases recognize high mannose oligosaccharides only when the latter are linked to a certain amino acid context that hallmarks lysosomal enzymes (16Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1990; 63: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Reitman M.L. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11977-11980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of P-GlcNAc, which is most efficient on the COOH-terminal glycan of pro-CD (18Cantor A.B. Baranski T.J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23349-23356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prevents the formation of complex oligosaccharide chains typical of secretory proteins that traverse the Golgi. Upon further transport, the GlcNAc group is removed by a phosphodiester glycosidase located in the late Golgi stacks and the exposed mannose 6-phosphate mediates lysosomal segregation (19von Figura K. Hasilik A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 167-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The efficiency of GlcNAc removal and of delivery to lysosomes may vary depending on the cell type and culture conditions (20Isidoro C. Radons J. Baccino F.M. Hasilik A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), leading to partial secretion (19von Figura K. Hasilik A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 167-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 20Isidoro C. Radons J. Baccino F.M. Hasilik A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). When the GlcNAc moiety is removed, the “uncovered” phosphate may be cleaved in vitro by treatment with alkaline phosphatase (AP) (21Isidoro C. Grässel S. Baccino F.M. Hasilik A. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1991; 29: 165-171PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, at least three phenotypes can be identified that correspond to different subcellular localizations of proCD: (i) nonphosphorylated proteins that have not reached the cis-Golgi, (ii) phosphorylated, AP-resistant forms that are localized in, or have transited through, the cis but not the trans cisternae of the Golgi, and (iii) phosphorylated, AP-sensitive molecules, that are in or beyond the trans-Golgi. We have exploited immunofluorescence microscopy and biochemical analyses to compare the modes by which a COOH-terminal KDEL sequence or an active cysteine in the μtp context lead to the ER localization of chimeric cathepsins. Our results indicate that, unlike KDEL, the μtp does not require recycling between the Golgi and the ER. Hence, thiol-dependent ER residence is due to true retention in this organelle and appears to be proximal with respect to KDEL retrieval. Monkey COS7 fibroblasts (22Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (23Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) or lipofection (24Felgner P.L.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), CDMμtpCys, and CDMμtpSer have been described in detail previously (7Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, the constructs encode a human CD cDNA tagged at the COOH terminus with a c-Myc-derived epitope (M) to which the hexapeptide SEKDEL or the μtp (wild-type or with the penultimate cysteine replaced by serine) is appended. 48 h after transfection the cells were trypsinized, seeded at low density on sterile coverslips and cultured overnight. When indicated, cells were incubated for further 4 h with 14.4 mM 2-ME. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (10 min at room temperature), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, incubated with the primary antibody (the mouse monoclonal anti-Myc 9E10 or a rabbit anti-calnexin kindly provided by Ari Helenius), followed by the appropriate secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies (Sigma). Metabolic labeling with a [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture (Tran35S-label) or 32P-labeled inorganic phosphate (ICN Biochemicals, Milan, Italy) was performed as described previously (9Guenzi S. Fra A.M. Sparvoli A. Bet P. Rocco M. Sitia R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2477-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Isidoro C. Radons J. Baccino F.M. Hasilik A. Eur. J.

Media and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a rabbit anti-human CD followed by either protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) or a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to oxirane beads (26Isidoro C. Demoz M. De Stefanis D. Baccino F.M. Bonelli G. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 866-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the chimeric protein was precipitated using the 9E10 monoclonal anti-Myc (27Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) covalently conjugated to Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (20Isidoro C. Radons J. Baccino F.M. Hasilik A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). When indicated, immunoprecipitates were incubated with 1 milliunit of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo-H, Boehringer Mannheim) for 24 h at 37°C (10Cals M.M. Guenzi S. Carelli S. Simmen T. Sparvoli A. Sitia R. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The presence of phosphomonoesters on CD molecules was ascertained by treating 32P-labeled immunoprecipitates for 24 h with or without 12.5 units of AP (Boehringer Mannheim), a condition sufficient to remove the phosphates from uncovered phosphomannosyl groups (21Isidoro C. Grässel S. Baccino F.M. Hasilik A. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1991; 29: 165-171PubMed Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were scanned by an automated densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). In some experiments, 32P- or 35S-labeled immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. The latter were first exposed to autoradiographic films or to a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) to detect radiolabeled proteins. Subsequently, to detect both the labeled and unlabeled chimeric proteins, filters were decorated with anti-Myc antibodies followed by peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse K chains and developed by ECL (Amersham Corp.). The chimeric proteins CDMK, CDMμtpCys, and CDMμtpSer have been described previously (7Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, see also Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 1, both CDMK and CDMμtpCys accumulate in a reticular region, largely overlapping with the distribution of the ER marker calnexin (compare panels A-D and B-E). Although the intracellular distribution of the two proteins is rather similar, quantitative differences can be observed, the CDMK staining being generally more intense than CDMμtpCys. As confirmed by biochemical data (see below), this reflects differences in intracellular pool sizes, derived from the different turnover rates of CDMμtpCys and CDMK (7Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with CDMμtpSer show a perinuclear focal staining (panel C) suggestive of intraGolgi accumulation of the chimeric protein. This is consistent with the observation that the cysteine to serine mutation allows secretion of chimeric CD (7Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, see also Fig. 2, panel B). To what extent this protein is also transported to lysosomes is not testable with this assay, as the c-Myc tag is rapidly cleaved within these organelles (12Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that thiol-mediated retention mechanisms can be reversed by treating cells with membrane permeant reducing agents, such as 2-ME (9Guenzi S. Fra A.M. Sparvoli A. Bet P. Rocco M. Sitia R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2477-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Alberini C.M. Bet P. Milstein C. Sitia R.

Also some CDMμtpCys can be mobilized with 2-ME: as shown in panel G, the Golgi area of COS7 cells transiently transfected with CDMμtpCys becomes stained by anti-Myc antibodies upon treatment with the reducing agent.Fig. 1Subcellular localization of chimeric CDs. Fourty-eight hours after transfection with CDMK (panels A and D), CDMμtpCys (panels B E, and G) or CDMμtpSer (panels C and F), COS7 cells were seeded onto sterile slides, cultured for further 16 h, and stained with 9E10 (panels A-C, anti-Myc) or anti-calnexin (panels D-F, anti-clnx) antibodies. Panel G shows the distribution of CDMμtpCys transfectants treated for 4 h with 14.4 mM 2-ME before staining with anti-Myc antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 2Different transport and processing of CDMμtpCys or CDMμtpSer. CDMμtpCys and CDMμtpSer were transiently expressed in COS7 cells and analyzed after labeling either the protein backbone with 35S-labeled amino acids (panels A and B) or the phosphomannosyl moieties with [32P]phosphates (panel C). In panel A, the migration on SDS-PAGE of the endogenous CD (mP) was compared with the heterologous CDMμtpCys chimera after pulse labeling for 15 min CDMμtpCys transfectants and untransfected COS7 cells (−) and chasing for 2 h. As in panels B and C, the different CD forms were immunoprecipitated using polyclonal anti-human CD antibodies, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and revealed by gel fluorography. Samples were treated with or without endoglycosidase H (Endo H). Panel B shows the immunoprecipitates obtained from cell lysates (C) and media (M) of cells pulsed for 2 h with 35S-labeled amino acids before or after 2 h of chase. Only CDMμtpSer presents slower migrating forms due to complex-type sugars (cP*). Panel C shows the chimeric or endogenous CD forms observed in the CDMμtpCys or CDMμtpSer transfectants after labeling for 2 h with [32P]phosphates and chasing for further 2 h. It is of note that the ratio between extracellular (M) and intracellular (C) phosphorylated molecules is higher for CDMμtpSer than for endogenous CD. The nature (covered or uncovered) of the phosphomannosyl group was ascertained on the basis of their sensitivity to alkaline phosphatase (AP). Panel D, the percentage of AP-resistant CDs (endogenous and chimeric) present in the media of cells chased 2 h was determined by densitometric analyses of the autoradiogram shown in panel C. ND, not detectable.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When cells transfected with CDMμtpCys are pulse labeled with radioactive amino acids, three bands are immunoprecipitated by the anti-human CD antibodies (Fig. 2, panel A, lane 3). The two fast migrating bands, which are present in both transfected and untransfected cells (compare lanes 1 and 3), likely correspond to different isoforms of the endogenous, monkey proCD (mP). The doublet is evident also after digestion with Endo-H (lanes 2 and 4), indicating that both these isoforms bear high mannose type oligosaccharides. The upper band present in lane 3, but absent from untransfected COS7 cells (lane 1), corresponds to the chimeric proCD (cP). Having an easy way to identify the transgene products, we then compared the transport-linked processing of CDMμtpCys and CDMμtpSer by labeling cells in parallel with 35S-labeled amino acids (panel B) or with [32P]orthophosphate (panel C). The endogenous CD molecules offer an useful internal control of the interorganelle trafficking and intraorganelle processing in the two transfectants. After a 2-h pulse with 35S-labeled amino acids, both the endogenous (mP) and the heterologous chimeric CD (cP) molecules are detected in the lysates of transfected cells (panel B). While some endogenous CD is present in the media of both CDMμtpCys and CDMμtpSer transfectants, only the CDMμtpSer mutant is secreted. Thus, as frequently observed in cultured cells (19von Figura K. Hasilik A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 167-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 20Isidoro C. Radons J. Baccino F.M. Hasilik A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), some CD molecules escape lysosomal segregation and are secreted by COS7 cells. After 2 h of chase, the differences between CDMμtpCys and CDMμtpSer are more evident. Little if any CDMμtpCys is secreted (lane 4). In contrast, large amounts of CDMμtpSer are present extracellularly, giving yield to a broad band whose heterogeneity likely reflects the processing of the tailpiece glycans (cP*). As the glycosylation site present in the μtp lacks the consensus sequence for mannose phosphorylation, this sugar undergoes the trimming and processing typical of secretory proteins upon transport through the Golgi (10Cals M.M. Guenzi S. Carelli S. Simmen T. Sparvoli A. Sitia R. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Hence, the observation that even after 2 h of chase the CDMμtpCys molecules remain sensitive to Endo-H (compare lanes 3 and 4 of panel A) is consistent with their ER localization. As expected, in both transfectants the endogenous proCD molecules acquire phosphates and are secreted, indicating transport throughout the secretory pathway (20Isidoro C. Radons J. Baccino F.M. Hasilik A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Radons J. Isidoro C. Hasilik A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Likewise, CDMμtpSer molecules are able to traverse the Golgi stacks, as demonstrated by the presence of phosphorylated, AP-sensitive molecules in both the cell lysates and media (panel C, lanes 5-8). In contrast, phosphorylated CDMμtpCys are not detected, suggesting that an active μ tailpiece is sufficient to prevent transport to the phosphotransferase compartments. Endogenous CD and CDMμtpSer show partial sensitivity to AP (panel C), likely due to inefficient uncovering. About one-third of the endogenous and half of the chimeric molecules bear AP-resistant phosphates (panel D). The ER localization of proteins bearing the KDEL signal is ensured through a continuous retrieval from the early Golgi stacks (for review, see 31Pelham H.R.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Consistently, CDMK acquires phosphates (Fig. 3, panel A, lane 1), an observation previously made by Pelham (12Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphorylated CDMμtpCys are barely detected (lane 3) even after prolonged exposures of the gel (lane 3*) unless 2ME is added (see below). In this experiment, samples were normalized with respect to the rate of transgene synthesis, determined by parallel short 35S pulse labeling experiments (not shown). Owing to their different half-lives in the ER, the steady state pool of CDMK is generally higher than that of CDMμtpCys. However, even taking this into account, we find that CDMK bears at least 10 times more phosphates than CDMμtpCys. Indeed, the 32P/WB densitometric ratios (see legend to Fig. 3 for details) were 0.6 and 0.05 for CDMK and CDMμtpCys, respectively (0.5 and 0.15 after 2-ME treatment). As shown in Fig. 1, panel G, part of CDMμtpCys is mobilized by 2-ME. Consistent with this, 2-ME also induces the secretion (Fig. 3, panel C) and phosphorylation (Fig. 3 panel A, lanes 4, and 4*) of CDMμtpCys. Like CDMμtpSer, the phosphorylated CDMμtpCys display partial sensitivity to AP (Fig. 3, panel B, lanes 3 and 4), while the vast majority of CDMK are resistant (lanes 1 and 2). These results indicate that the lack of phosphorylation of CDMμtpCys is not due to alterations in the folding of the chimeric molecule, but rather to its actual retention in a compartment proximal to the site in which phosphotransferases are located. The main conclusion that we draw from these studies is that the thiol-dependent ER localization of proteins is due primarily to actual retention in this organelle without retrieval from the Golgi. The key finding is that, in COS transfectants, CDMμtpCys molecules do not acquire phosphates unless transport is induced by reducing agents or by mutating the critical cysteine residue (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). In contrast, CDMK molecules, which show a similar subcellular distribution by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1), are intensely phosphorylated (Fig. 3). The differences in trafficking and processing detected in our chimeras cannot be ascribed to alterations in the cellular transport machinery, as the endogenous monkey proCD acquires phosphates and is transported similarly in all transfectants. Thus, the addition of an exposed thiol is sufficient (i) to confer ER residence and (ii) to prevent post-ER modifications on a protein not naturally resident in the ER. The results are summarized in the scheme depicted in Fig. 4. Proteins with exposed thiols are effectively retained (and degraded) before the compartment where lysosomal enzymes are phosphorylated. The precise localization of the phosphotransferases within the cis-Golgi network (32Mellman I. Simons K. Cell. 1992; 68: 829-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), and in particular their presence within the intermediate compartment remains to be determined (15Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 33Lazzarino D.A. Gabel C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10118-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Schweizer A. Matter K. Ketcham C.M. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The possibility that thiol exposing proteins transit rapidly through the phosphorylation compartment and are then immediately degraded cannot be formally ruled out. However, several observations argue against this model. The few CDMμtpCys molecules that reach the cis-Golgi and are phosphorylated seem to proceed undisturbed to the trans-Golgi stacks, thus escaping irreversibly the cysteine-mediated quality control. This is in agreement with our previous findings that thiol-mediated retention is not operative in or beyond the Golgi (29Valetti C. Sitia R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1311-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, the degradation of CDMμtpCys is not impaired by brefeldin A (7Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting that, as shown in other systems (35Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1991; 3: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), its proteolysis does not require vesicular transport. During B cell differentiation, the μtp cysteine mediates the different fates of unpolymerized IgM, retention and degradation in B cells, polymerization and secretion in plasma cells (13Sitia R. Neuberger M. Alberini C. Bet P. Fra A. Valetti C. Williams G. Milstein C. Cell. 1990; 60: 781-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Likewise, for unknown reasons, the fate of CDMμtpCys varies depending on the cell lines in which it is expressed: in transient COS7 transfectants, retention (and degradation) prevail over the μtp-dependent dimerization, while in stable CHO transfectants some CDMμtpCys molecules escape retention, mostly through formation of covalent homodimers (7Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). 2C. Maggioni, C. Isidoro, A. Fra, and R. Sitia, unpublished data. Hence, depending on the host cell line, the μtp can be exploited as a portable ER dimerization (or retention) module. While the evidence for a retrieving function of the KDEL receptor is overwhelming, it seems clear that additional mechanisms contribute in determining the localization of ER resident proteins. If the latter had unrestricted access to the Golgi, the KDEL receptor would be easily saturated. Moreover, BiP, PDI, ERp72, and calreticulin mutants lacking the KDEL (or KDEL like) motif are secreted at different rates and in general very slowly (36Mazzarella R.A. Srinivasan M. Haugejorden S.M. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1094-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The KDEL motif, as originally proposed by Munro and Pelham (37Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar), acts then as a salvage mechanism to return proteins which left the ER. Exit from this organelle is thought to occur by a default pathway, limited by retention (38Wieland F.T. Gleason M.L. Serafini T. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 289-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, it can be also accelerated by receptor-mediated transport (39Schimmoller F. Singer-Kruger B. Schroder S. Kruger U. Barlowe C. Riezmann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), possibly by concentration in ER subregions connected with the forward transport machinery (40Bednarek S.Y. Ravazzola M. Hosobuchi M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Schekman R. Orci L. Cell. 1995; 83: 1183-1196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 41Mizuno M. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). It would seem conceivable that thiol-mediated retention and other mechanisms that restrict the exit of cargo proteins from the ER reduce also the movement of resident proteins. Indeed, unassembled Ig-λ chains form reversible disulfide bonds with numerous proteins in the ER (11Reddy P. Sparvoli A. Fagioli C. Fassina G. Sitia R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2077-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Disulfide interchange reactions can be one of the mechanisms that contribute to the formation of an ER protein matrix that functions to exclude macromolecules from vesicular transport (11Reddy P. Sparvoli A. Fagioli C. Fassina G. Sitia R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2077-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 42Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Thus, with hydrophobic, lectin-sugar and other types of dynamic interactions (43Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 44Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), thiol reactivity would contribute in regulating the export of proteins to the Golgi.

To understand the mechanisms that regulate human thrombin receptor (HTR) expression, we cloned and characterized the HTR gene.

DNA sequence analysis indicated the presence of two SP-1-AP-2 consensus binding sequences, near or within the transcription initiation sites, and consensus binding sequences for numerous regulatory proteins that potentially modulate HTR expression. Functional analysis of the HTR promoter was performed by transfecting human microvascular endothelial cells with HTR promoter region-luciferase constructs. The highest level of expression was obtained with a 0.7-kb promoter sequence and was progressively less with fragments of 0.54, 1.16, 1.6, and ~3.2 kb.

The serine protease, thrombin, mediates several biologic processes that are essential for maintaining vascular integrity. In normal arteries, thrombin is a potent endothelial-dependent vasodilator capable of stimulating blood flow to areas of ischemia (1Tesfamariam B. Allen G.T. Normandin D. Antonaccio M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1744-H1749PubMed Google Scholar). In injured arteries, thrombin-mediated blood coagulation (2Yao S.K. Ober J.C. Ferguson J.J. Anderson H.V. Maraganore J. Buja L.M. Willerson J.T.

The majority of these effects are mediated by activation of thrombin receptors present on the cell surface (12Vu T.K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.

A distinguishing feature of the thrombin receptor and of one additional, recently cloned, “protease activated” receptor (15Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Thrombin receptor gene expression is highly regulated in the blood vessel wall (16Nelken N.A. Soifer S.J. O'Keefe J. Vu T.-K. Charo I. Coughlin S. J. Clin.

A full understanding of the mechanisms of thrombin receptor gene regulation will require characterization of the regulatory region of this important gene. For this reason, we cloned and characterized the human thrombin receptor (HTR) *This work was supported by National Institutes of Health, NHLBI Grant HL48667.

Section 1734 solely to indicate this fact.Most of the data presented in this report had been posted in the 68th Scientific Session of the American Heart Association (November 13-16, 1995, Anaheim, CA). While our paper was being revised, Schmidt et al. (48Schmidt V.A. Vitale E. Bahou W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9307-9312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported a human thrombin receptor gene structure analysis that overlaps with some of the findings in this study.The nucleotide sequence(s) reported in this paper has been submitted to the GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank with accession number(s) U63331. gene including the putative regulatory region. Here we report the structural organization and promoter activity of the HTR gene. The genomic organization of the HTR gene consists of two exons, and a single intron that is ~15 kb in size. DNA sequencing of 2.8 kb upstream of the translation initiation codon, the putative regulatory region, reveals no open reading frames and shows multiple potential nuclear protein binding motifs. The presence of several potential antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the proximal promoter region is consistent with the observed redox-sensitive modulation of HTR expression in vitro. Both S1 mapping and RNase protection assay locate multiple transcription initiation sites, consistent with the absence of a TATA box sequence within the proximal promoter. Functional analysis of the regulatory region of the HTR gene indicates significant promoter activity present within 0.54 kb upstream of the translation initiation codon and maximal activity present in a 0.7-kb promoter construct. A human genomic DNA bacteriophage P1 library (Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis, MO) was screened by PCR to obtain HTR gene-positive clones. Based on the HTR-cDNA sequence, a pair of primers, 5′-ATCCCATGCAGTCCCTCT-3′ (841-858 in HTR cDNA), and 3′-CGGAAGAGACGACAGAAG-5′ (1041-1058 in HTR cDNA) was designed to amplify HTR-relevant DNA fragments. These primers were used to amplify the HTR-coding sequence using genomic DNA as a template from whole human blood before library screening for confirming the primers. In brief, 1 μl of whole blood was mixed with 18 μl of deionized formamide, and the sample was heated to 95°C for 5 min to lyse the cells. The lysate was then added to a reaction mixture volume consisting of 200 μM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 0.2 μM primers, 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2.5 units of Tth DNA polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). These mixtures were overlaid with two drops of mineral oil and subjected to 30 cycles of PCR amplification using a Perkin-Elmer Corp. model 480 GeneAmp PCR system at 85°C for 30 s, 40°C for 30 s, and 60°C for 30 s (22Panaccio M. Georgesz M. Lew A.M. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 238-243PubMed Google Scholar). PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gel. The confirmed pair of primers was then used to select the positive sublibrary from the human P1 library (constructed with a P1 phage vector). The positive sublibrary obtained for the HTR gene was then screened for HTR gene-positive clones. HTR gene-containing positive clones were confirmed by dot hybridization and further characterized by Southern blotting. Bacteriophage P1 plasmid DNA (10-50 ng/μl in a 0.5-ml Eppendorf tube), was denatured on the PCR cycler at 100°C for 5 min and immediately placed in an ice-water bath. DNA was then applied to nylon or nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were baked at 80°C for 2 h. Hybridization was performed using either a 300-bp 32P-labeled intron probe containing the HTR-coding sequence 5′ to the intron (5′-cDNA probe), or a 2-kb 32P-labeled intron probe containing the sequence from the 3′ portion of the HTR intron (intron probe, containing no coding sequence). The positive genomic DNA which hybridized with the HTR 5′−300-bp cDNA probe (4-5 μg) was then digested by restriction enzymes and fractionated by electrophoresis on 0.7% agarose gel. The gel was placed in 0.2 N HCl for 10 min, rinsed several times in water, and then denatured in alkaline solution for 15 min. After 30 min of neutralization, the DNA in the gel was transferred to a nylon filter by capillary action and hybridized with either of the 32P-labeled probes described above. The proper hybridizing DNA fragments were then isolated from the agarose gel, purified by Geneclean II kit (Bio 101, Vista, CA), and subcloned into pT7T318U or PUC18 for further restriction analysis and sequencing. Electron microscopy was performed to define the structure of the HTR gene. HTR-cRNA was obtained from HTR-cDNA (23Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as follows. Plasmid DNA (pBluescript SK-HTRcDNA, 5 μg) was linearized with SacI and transcribed in 100 μl of a reaction mixture containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 8 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM spermidine, 30 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM each of rNTP, 100 units of rRNasin® ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI), and 225 units of bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Transcription was carried out at 37°C for 1 h, after which template DNA was removed by incubation with 2 units of RNase-free RQ1 DNase I at 37°C for 15 min. The mixture was extracted with phenol, phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v) and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v), respectively. Sodium acetate (pH 5.2) was added to a final concentration of 0.3 M, and RNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol at −20°C overnight. The pellet was washed twice with 75% ethanol and dried in air for 15 min. The cRNA was resuspended in 10 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and the concentration of cRNA was determined by spectrophotometry. HTR-cRNA was heterohybridized with HTR genomic DNA (gDNA). HTR-gDNA (P1282) was first linearized by rare restriction enzymes, SfiI or NotI, and then allowed to heterohybridize with HTR-cRNA in a 0.5-ml Eppendorf tube in a total volume of 20 μl, containing linearized gDNA (3-5 μg/ml), cRNA (5-8 μg/ml), 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.5), 0.3 M NaCl, and 80% deionized formamide. One drop of mineral oil was placed on top of the 20-μl sample before incubating at 85°C for 5 min, then at 58-60°C for 3 h and finally at 4°C. Immediately before placing hybrid solutions onto collodion-coated grids, pBR322 (double strand, 4.36 kb) and ØX174 DNA (single strand, 5.38 kb) were added to the reaction mixture as internal molecular length markers. Collodion film-covered grids were prepared using 2% collodion in amyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences). The cRNA-gDNA hybrid solution was then spread onto collodion-coated grids using standard techniques (25Davis R.W. Simon M. Davidson N. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 21: 413-428Crossref Scopus (1410) Google Scholar, 26Ferguson J. Davis R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 123: 417-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Grids were stained with uranyl acetate (10 μM in 90% ethanol, prepared immediately before use), for 30 s and subjected to low angle (~5 degrees) rotary shadowing for 5-12 s. Samples were viewed in the electron microscope at a 50-80 kV accelerating voltage at a magnification greater than × 10,000. The distance of the specimen from the electrodes, speed of rotation, current density, and duration of evaporation of platinum were determined before the procedure. To confirm the size of the intron, mega-PCR analysis was performed using P1282 plasmids containing HTR genomic DNA. The oligonucleotide primers used for mega-PCR were: 5′-GCGAAGACCGGCTCCCCGACCCGCAGAAGTCAGGAGAGAGGGTGAAGCGGAG3-′ (121-172 bp in HTR-cDNA, 52 mer) and 3′-CACCCAATTGACTTATGTCTAATCAGAGGTAGT-5′ (415-447 bp in HTR-cDNA, 33 mer). The reaction mixture contained 25-50 ng template DNA (P1282) and 0.2 μM each of the above primers in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 16 mM ammonium sulfate, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 150 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 250 μM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP in a total volume of 50 μl. Immediately before incubation, 12.5 units of KlenTaqI (AB Peptides, Inc.) and 0.08 unit of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were added, and the reaction mixture was placed in Perkin-Elmer microamp thin tube and subjected to 24 cycles of PCR using a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 9600. Incubation temperatures and times for PCR were 99°C for 30 s, 67°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 18 min. After the PCR product was resolved on a 0.7% agarose gel at 50 V overnight, the gel was stained by ethidium bromide for 40 min and photographed, then transferred to a nylon filter for Southern blotting, as above. Potential transcription initiation sites were determined by S1 nuclease protection assay using mRNA from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human placenta. HUVEC poly(A+) RNA was prepared with the poly(A+) RNA isolation kit, (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Human placental poly(A+) RNA was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The primer synthesized for S1 nuclease protection assay was a 22 mer located upstream of the putative translation start site ATG in the HTR gene (nucleotides −133 to −154). This primer was end-labeled with [32P]ATP, and extended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I along the HTR gene using an EcoRI fragment of HTR genomic DNA cloned in a pT7T318U vector (pT7T318U-HTR/5.5). After digestion with EcoRI, the radioactive probe was separated on a 1% alkaline agarose gel. The probe (5 × 104 cpm) was mixed with either 4 μg of HUVEC poly(A+) RNA or 10 μg of human placental poly(A+) RNA in 0.3 M sodium acetate. After precipitation with 2.5 volumes of ethanol, DNA probe-poly(A+) RNA mixtures were resuspended in 20 μl of S1 hybridization solution containing 40 mM PIPES (pH 6.4), 1 mM EDTA, 0.4 M NaCl, and 80% deionized formamide and incubated at 65°C for 10 min, then at 30°C overnight for annealing. The hybrids were digested with 300 μl of S1 nuclease digestion buffer containing 0.28 M NaCl, 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.6), 4.5 mM ZnSO4, and 300-350 units of S1 nuclease (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 30°C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 80 μl of S1 stop buffer containing 4 M NH4Ac, 20 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), and 40 μg/ml tRNA. After precipitation and washing with 100% and 70% ethanol, respectively, the pellets were resuspended in 3 μl of Tris/EDTA buffer, mixed with 4 μl of loading dye in 90% formamide, and electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel next to a M13 sequencing ladder marker. The antisense cRNA probe was obtained using an in vitro transcription kit, MAX1script (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's recommendations with minor modifications: 100 μCi of [32P]UTP at 800 Ci/mmol and 6 μl of 0.05 mM UTP in 20 μl total volume were used for antisense RNA probes (II-V; 870, 322, 545, and 425 bp) of the HTR 5′ region (see Fig. 6A). After transcription for 60 min at 37°C, the DNA template was digested with 2 units of RNase-free DNase I for 25 min, and full-length antisense RNA probes were recovered from 8 M urea-denatured PAGE gel by elusion buffer (0.5 M ammonium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS) at 35°C overnight. RNase protection assays were performed using a ribonuclease protection assay kit (RPA II™, Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 20-50 μg of total RNA were incubated with 106 cpm of 32P-labeled antisense cRNA probes in 20 μl of hybridization buffer (80% deionized formamide, 100 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.4), 300 mM sodium acetate (pH 6.4), and 1 mM EDTA) heated to 90-95°C for 3-5 min and hybridized overnight at 42°C in an incubator. 200 μl of RNase digestion buffer with 2.5 units/ml of RNase A and 100 units/ml of RNase T were then added to the hybridization mixtures and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. 300 μl of RNase inactivation/precipitation mixture was added to stop the RNase treatment and precipitate the protected fragments. After 15 min of precipitation at −70°C, the mixture was centrifuged and dried in room air. The protected fragments were resuspended in 6 μl of gel loading buffer (95% formamide, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.025% SDS). The mixture was heated to 80°C for 3 min before electrophoresis on Tris/borate/EDTA-polyacrylamide/urea sequencing gels along with an RNA ladder and M13 sequencing marker, dried, exposed to x-ray film at −80°C for 1-10 days, and then developed. pT7T318U-HTR/5.5 and pT7T318U-HTR/2.5 were obtained by ligating either a 5.5-kb EcoRI fragment (containing 5′ sequence, Exon I, and the 5′ intron-exon junction) or a 2.5-kb EcoRI fragment (containing most of Exon II and the 3′ sequence intron-exon junction) of HTR genomic DNA from P1282 into pT7T318U at the EcoRI site in the polylinker. pBluescript SKII-HTR/6 was obtained by inserting a 6-kb HindIII fragment from the HTR gene into pBluescript SKII at the HindIII Site. The intron-exon junction sequences were obtained by dideoxy sequencing with the Sequenase™ version 2.0 sequencing kit (Amersham Life Science, Arlington Heights, IL) used according to the manufacturer's specifications. For more comprehensive 5′ sequencing, nested deletions of a 12-kb HTR genomic DNA fragment were obtained. PUC18-HTR/12 was constructed by inserting a 12-kb BamHI HTR 5′ genomic DNA fragment into the PUC18 BamHI site in the polylinker. The 5′ deletions of pUC18-HTR/12 were carried out by the double-stranded nested deletion method (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), as follows. The PUC18-HTR/12 plasmid was digested with SphI and XbaI. The resultant fragment was digested for various increasing lengths of time with exonuclease III and the single-stranded region was removed by S1 nuclease digestion. After analysis of plasmid deletion, recircularization, and transformation, the nested deletion plasmid DNA was prepared by Qiaprep-8 plasmid kit (QIAGEN, Chatsworth, CA). The nucleotide sequences of nested plasmid deletion inserts were determined by PRISM™ ready reaction dideoxy Terminator Cycle™ sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and analyzed on the Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencing system. All sequences were confirmed by a minimum of three separate reactions or sequencing overlap of different nested deletion subclones. The HTR promoter region sequence was analyzed by the Macintosh MacVector™ 4.1.1 software system and Entrez retrieval software system, developed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a division of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), and distributed by subscription through the U. S. Government Printing Office. Poluc-HTR/-4.1, Poluc-HTR/-3.2, Poluc-HTR/-1.6, Poluc-HTR/-1.1, Poluc-HTR/-0.7, Poluc-HTR/-0.5, and Poluc-HTR/-0.15 were constructed by inserting the 4.1-kb XhoII-SmaI, 3.2-kb SSP1-SmaI, 1601-bp PvuII-SmaI, 1163-bp EcoNI-SmaI, 702-bp DraI-SmaI, 542-bp SalI-SmaI HTR, and 158-bp EcoR47-SmaI fragments of the putative regulatory region into the polylinker BamHI/SmaI, SmaI, SmaI, SmaI, SmaI, SalI/SmaI, and SmaI sites, respectively, of Poluc plasmid. Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) were obtained as a gift from Dr. Wright Coughlin and were grown in endothelial cell basal medium (Clonetics, San Diego, CA), with 2% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Before transfection experiments, HMECs were trypsinized, plated into six-well plates and incubated at 37°C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for approximately 18 h. Cells at 50-70% confluency were used for transfection. One hour before transfection the medium was removed and replaced with 2 ml of Opti-MEM 1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The medium was then aspirated, and the cells were washed with PBS (1-2 ml) immediately before adding the DNA-liposome complex. Plasmid DNA (1-4 μg) was added to a tube containing 0.1 ml of Opti-MEM 1 and mixed. Four microliters of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc., BRL) were added to another tube containing 0.1 ml of Opti-MEM 1 and mixed. Plasmid DNA and Lipofectin were then mixed together and incubated at room temperature to allow the complex to form. After 15 min, the DNA-liposomal complex was diluted with 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM 1, mixed, and slowly layered on top of the cells. Cells were then incubated at 37°C for 6 h, after which 2 ml of endothelial cell basal medium with 2% fetal bovine serum were added. Cells were grown for 48 h at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. After 48 h, the cells were lysed in 0.15 ml of lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell lysate was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1 min at 4°C. Luciferase activity was measured by mixing 20 μl of supernatant in a Black-lite 96-well microtiter plate (Packard) with 50 μl of luciferase assay buffer (Promega) for 0.25 min in a Packard top-count scintillation counter. Included with each assay were serial dilutions of luciferase standards (Sigma) from 10−11 to 10−19M. Results were tabulated as counts per second (CPS), and normalized according to alkaline phosphatase (PAP) activity (PAP gene in pSV2Apap) per well. pSV2-luc was used as a positive control and poluc as a negative control for these transfection experiments. We obtained two HTR-gene positive clones (P1282 and P1287) by screening a human genomic DNA bacteriophage P1 library. Dot hybridization analysis of P1282 and P1287 DNA with a 300-bp HTR cDNA sequence from the 5′ end of the cDNA (5′-cDNA probe) and a 2-kb intron sequence located at the 3′ end of the intron (intron probe) indicated that both P1282 and P1287 contained a sequence that hybridized to the Intron probe (Fig. 1C). Only P1282 hybridized to the 5′-cDNA probe (Fig. 1C), indicating that P1282 and P1287 overlap with each other, but that only the P1282 clone contains the 5′ region of the HTR gene (Fig. 1A). The restriction map of P1282 DNA was determined by Southern blotting. P1282 DNA was digested with various restriction enzymes, separated on a 0.7% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with either the 5′-cDNA probe or the intron probe (Fig. 1). Sequencing analysis of the probe-positive bands of subclones (Fig. 1B) using primers based on the HTR-cDNA sequence showed only two exons in the HTR gene (Fig. 1A). Exon I contains the putative regulatory region, the 5′-untranslated sequence present in the thrombin receptor cDNA, and 85 nucleotides of the coding sequence. Exon II contains the remainder of the coding sequence and the 3′-untranslated region essentially identical to the previously published (12Vu T.K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar) 3′-untranslated sequence (Fig. 1D). P1282 DNA was cut with Cfr10I, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with either the 5′-cDNA probe or the intron probe. Both probes hybridized with the same ~15-kb band (Fig. 2A). Combined with results of the HTR gene restriction enzyme map (Fig. 1A) and Southern blot analysis of a P1282 PvuII digestion (Figs. 1A and 2B), this finding suggested that the ~15-kb band is a single intron interposed between a small 5′ exon (Exon I) and a large 3′ exon (Exon II) (Fig. 3). To more accurately confirm the size and number of the introns, mega-PCR analysis with a combination of klenTaq1 polymerase and Pfu DNA polymerase was performed (Fig. 4, A and B). The identity of the mega-PCR product obtained as the intron dividing Exons I and II was confirmed by Southern blotting with a 2-kb intron probe (Fig. 4C), which revealed specific hybridization of the same ~15-kb band. This result was further confirmed by electron microscopic analysis (Fig. 3). The major identifiable intron identified by this approach was the ~15-kb DNA loop (an example of which is shown in Fig. 3) obtained when HTR cRNA and P1282 DNA heterohybridized in an 80% formamide solution at 58-60°C (see “Experimental Procedures”). Subclone DNA sequencing of the HTR gene (Fig. 1B) and extensive PCR analysis (not shown) indicated that no other introns were present within coding sequence of the HTR gene, and although it is difficult to exclude, no evidence of an intron within the 5′ sequence was found. Interestingly, sequencing of the exon-intron junction of the HTR gene suggested that this was an exception of the gt-ag intron rule (Fig. 5).Fig. 3Electron micrographs of HTR gene-cRNA hybrid show the 15-kb intron loop.

https://openalex.org/W2002982667,"In a previous study (Hardy et al. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 18535-18540), we observed that the manganese-based superoxide dismutase mimetic Mn(II)-dichloro(1,4,7,10,13-pentaazacyclopentadecane) (MnPAM) inhibited neutrophil-mediated cell injury in vitro. We have extended these studies with the low molecular weight superoxide dismutase mimic to evaluate the role of superoxide in neutrophil-mediated tissue injury in vivo. In a dose-dependent manner, MnPAM inhibited colonic tissue injury and neutrophil accumulation into the colonic tissue induced by the intracolonic instillation of dilute aqueous acetic acid in mice. Tissue injury was assessed by visual and histological analysis. Neutrophil infiltration was determined by tissue myeloperoxidase activity and confirmed by histological analysis. Two novel Mn(II) dichloro complexes of the carbon-substituted macrocycles 2-methyl-1,4,7,10,13-pentaazacyclopentadecane (MnMAM) and 2-(2-methylpropyl)-1,4,7,10,13-pentaazacyclopentadecane (MnBAM) effectively catalyzed the dismutation of superoxide with catalytic rate constants (kcat) of 3.31 × 107M−1 s−1 and 1.91 × 107M−1 s−1, respectively, as determined by stopped-flow kinetic analysis at pH 8.1 and 21°C. The superoxide dismutase mimetics MnMAM and MnBAM also attenuated dilute aqueous acetic acid-induced tissue injury and neutrophil infiltration into colonic tissue; however, two Mn(II) complexes that had little or no detectable SOD activity (kcat≤ 0.1 × 107M−1 s−1), specifically the Mn(II) dichloro complexes of 1,4,7,10,13-pentaazacyclohexadecane and 1,4,7,11,14-pentaazacycloheptadecane, failed to inhibit the colonic tissue injury or infiltration of neutrophils in mice treated intracolonically with dilute aqueous acetic acid. These results are consistent with a proinflammatory role for superoxide in the mediation of neutrophil infiltration in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2043718821,"We have reported the localization on yeast microsomes for a modified P450c27 (mic-P450c27) that contains the microsomal targeting signal of bovine P450c17 in front of the mature form of rat mitochondrial P450c27 (Sakaki, T., Akiyoshi-Shibata, M., Yabusaki, Y., and Ohkawa, H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16497-16502). In this study, we found that mic-P450c27 could be reduced by NADPH in the yeast microsomes without supplement of its physiological redox partners, adrenodoxin and NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase. In order to elucidate the direct electron transfer from NADPH-P450 reductase to mic-P450c27, we carried out simultaneous expression of mic-P450c27 and yeast P450 reductase. The reduction rate of mic-P450c27 was increased by overproduction of yeast P450 reductase, roughly in proportion to the reductase content in the microsomes. In addition, we constructed a fused enzyme between mic-P450c27 and yeast P450 reductase. The reduction rate of heme iron in the fused enzyme was too rapid to be measured. These recombinant yeast microsomes showed a notable 27-hydroxylation activity toward 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol in the absence of adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase. Finally, we purified mic-P450c27 from the recombinant yeast microsomes and reconstituted the hydroxylation system in liposomal membranes using the purified mic-P450c27 and yeast NADPH-P450 reductase. Mic-P450c27 was reduced by NADPH and showed its monooxygenase activity on the reconstituted system. Therefore, yeast NADPH-P450 reductase alone was found to transfer two electrons from NADPH to mic-P450c27. These results clearly show that mic-P450c27 not only localizes on the microsomes but also functions as a microsomal cytochrome P450 that accepts electrons from NADPH-P450 reductase. We have reported the localization on yeast microsomes for a modified P450c27 (mic-P450c27) that contains the microsomal targeting signal of bovine P450c17 in front of the mature form of rat mitochondrial P450c27 (Sakaki, T., Akiyoshi-Shibata, M., Yabusaki, Y., and Ohkawa, H.

These results clearly show that mic-P450c27 not only localizes on the microsomes but also functions as a microsomal cytochrome P450 that accepts electrons from NADPH-P450 reductase. Cytochrome P450 represents a large group of structurally related hemoproteins that catalyze the monooxygenase reactions of a wide variety of both endogenous and exogenous compounds. P450 monooxygenases can be classified into two types based on the electron supplying proteins to P450. In class I P450s (1Ravichandran K.G. Boddupali S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar), which include most of bacterial soluble P450s and mitochondrial P450s, the electron transport chain involves an FAD-containing enzyme, ferredoxin reductase, and an iron-sulfur enzyme, ferredoxin, to transfer electrons from NADH or NADPH to the terminal P450. In class II P450s, which include microsomal P450s and bacterial P450BM-3 (2Fulco A.J. Ruttinger R.T. Life Sci. 1987; 40: 1754-1769Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), electrons are transferred from NADPH to P450 by the catalysis of NADPH-P450 reductase that contains one molecule each of FAD and FMN. Although detailed studies have been carried out for the interaction between the P450s and their partner proteins in the both electron transfer systems (1Ravichandran K.G. Boddupali S.S. Hasemann C.A.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6848-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the interaction between mitochondrial P450s and the NADPH-P450 reductase or between microsomal P450s and the ferredoxin has not been well demonstrated yet. Recently, Jenkins and Waterman (5Jenkins C.M. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27401-27408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported a very interesting finding for the electron transfer system to heterologously expressed P450c17 in Escherichia coli. They purified both an FMN-containing flavodoxin and an FAD-containing NADPH-flavodoxin reductase from E. coli and found that these enzymes could support 17α-hydroxylation activity of bovine adrenal microsomal P450c17, which explains well why P450c17 expressed in E. coli is functionally active without P450 reductase (6Barnes H.J. Arlotto M.P. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). From an evolutionary standpoint, microsomal P450 is thought to have diverged from a bacterial soluble P450, followed by the appearance of mitochondrial P450 from microsomal P450 (7Nebert D.W. Nelson D.R. Estabrook R.W. Feyereisen R. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Gonzalez F. Guengerich F.P. Gunsalus I.C. Johnson E.F. Loper J.C. Sato R. Waterman M.R. Waxman D.J.

Alteration of soluble P450 to microsomal one could be explained by the addition of an amino-terminal hydrophobic sequence to the soluble P450 and that of microsomal P450 to mitochondrial one could be attributed to the substitution of the signal sequence for the localization into the mitochondrial inner membranes. Indeed, we have succeeded in conversion of subcellular localization of P450c27 from yeast mitochondria to microsomes only by altering its amino-terminal targeting signal (8Sakaki T. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16497-16502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This microsomally modified P450c27 (referred to as mic-P450c27) was active in both 25-hydroxylation of 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 27-hydroxylation of cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol (THC) 1The abbreviations used are: THC5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triolADRNADPH-adrenodoxin reductaseADXadrenodoxin. when reconstituted in vivo and in vitro with adrenodoxin (ADX) and NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase (ADR) (8Sakaki T. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16497-16502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no possible schemes have been suggested for the evolution or alteration of the electron transfer partners to P450. 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase adrenodoxin. In the present study, we examined by the use of molecular engineering methods whether mic-P450c27 could accept electrons efficiently from yeast NADPH-P450 reductase. In addition, we have constructed a highly active fused enzyme between mic-P450c27 and yeast P450 reductase. These findings clearly indicated that yeast P450 reductase can transfer electrons from NADPH directly to mic-P450c27. DNA modifying enzymes, restriction enzymes, and DNA sequencing kit were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. (Kyoto, Japan). 5β-[3H]Cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol (THC) and 125I-labeled Protein A were from Amersham Japan (Tokyo, Japan). L-α-Phosphatidylcholine (egg yolk, type III-E) was obtained from Sigma, and L-α-phosphatidylserine (bovine spinal cord, grade I) and L-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (egg yolk, grade I) were from Lipid Products (Nutfields, Surrey, UK). Linker DNAs were synthesized by using an Applied Biosystems 380A DNA synthesizer. E. coli HB101 (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH22 (9Oeda K. Sakaki T. Ohkawa H. DNA (N. Y.). 1985; 4: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) were used as recombinant host strains. The yeast expression vector pAAH5N (10Murakami H. Yabusaki Y. Sakaki T. Shibata M. Ohkawa H. J. Biochem.(Tokyo). 1990; 108: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was used to construct expression plasmids. The expression plasmid pAMS25 for mic-P450c27 was constructed as described previously (8Sakaki T. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16497-16502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant DNA procedures and transformation of E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells were performed as reported previously (9Oeda K. Sakaki T. Ohkawa H. DNA (N. Y.). 1985; 4: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the synthesized linker DNAs and the junction region of the fused enzyme cDNA was performed as described previously (11Sakaki T. Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H. DNA Cell Biol. 1987; 6: 31-39Google Scholar). Recombinant E. coli and S. cerevisiae strains were cultivated in L broth and concentrated SD medium, respectively, as described (12Sakaki T. Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Murakami H. Ohkawa H. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction was carried out with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene Cloning Systems, CA) by using Perkin Elmer PC2000 apparatus. P450 hemoprotein content in whole cells or subcellular fractions was determined by a reduced CO difference spectrum (9Oeda K. Sakaki T. Ohkawa H. DNA (N. Y.). 1985; 4: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) using an extinction coefficient of 91 mM−1 cm−1 (13Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular proteins from the recombinant yeast strain were subjected to an electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred electrophoretically from the gel to a nitrocellulose filter (9Oeda K. Sakaki T. Ohkawa H. DNA (N. Y.). 1985; 4: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The filter was probed with anti-mic-P450c27 antiserum (8Sakaki T. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16497-16502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-yeast NADPH-P450 reductase Ig (14Aoyama Y. Yoshida Y. Kubota S. Kumaoka H. Furumichi A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 185: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), followed by 125I-labeled Protein A as described previously (9Oeda K. Sakaki T. Ohkawa H. DNA (N. Y.). 1985; 4: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Microsomal fraction was prepared from the recombinant yeast strains as described previously (9Oeda K. Sakaki T. Ohkawa H. DNA (N. Y.). 1985; 4: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Mic-P450c27 was purified from AH22/pAMS25 microsomes to an electrophoretically homogeneous form by the same procedures as reported (8Sakaki T. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16497-16502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final preparation (12 nmol of P450/mg of protein) was incorporated into liposomal membranes, and the hydroxylation system was reconstituted in vitro with yeast NADPH-P450 reductase (specific activity of 150 units/mg protein, provided by Dr. Y. Aoyama, Soka University) (15Kominami S. Inoue S. Higuchi A. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The molar ratio of mic-P450, P450 reductase, and phospholipid was 1:1:3000. The monooxygenase activity of the microsomal fraction was measured as follows. The reaction mixture contained each of the microsomal fractions prepared from the recombinant yeast strains (0.025-0.1 μM P450), 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.5 mM EDTA, and [3H]THC (20, 50, 100, or 200 μM). The reaction was initiated by addition of NADPH to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. After incubation at 37°C for 3 or 5 min, the reaction was stopped by vigorous mixing with CH2Cl2. The organic phase was recovered and dried up. The resulting residue was solubilized with acetonitrile for high performance liquid chromatography analysis with a linear gradient of 50-100% acetonitrile aqueous solution at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 50°C (8Sakaki T. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16497-16502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]THC and its hydroxylated metabolite were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with monitoring the radioactivity on a Flow-one β system (Packard). The THC 27-hydroxylation activity on the reconstituted liposomal membrane was similarly measured. The cellular THC 27-hydroxylation activity of the recombinant yeast was measured by incubation of the cell culture with 10 μM [3H]THC at 30°C as described previously (8Sakaki T. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16497-16502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stopped flow analysis was performed at 10°C using a dual-wavelength stopped-flow device (Unisoku Co., Ltd., Hirakata, Japan) as described previously (16Kominami S. Ogawa N. Morimune R. De-Ying H. Takemori S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Sakaki T. Kominami S. Takemori S. Ohkawa H. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4933-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained the microsomal fraction (0.2 μM P450 or its fused enzyme), 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 20% glycerol, 50 mM glucose, 20 units/ml glucose oxidase, 200 units/ml catalase, and 100 μM THC. The reaction was initiated by rapid mixing of the microsomes with an equal volume of 80 μM NADPH in the presence of CO, and the change in the absorbance difference between 450 and 490 nm was recorded. A computer program was employed to fit the kinetic data as described (17Sakaki T. Kominami S. Takemori S. Ohkawa H. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4933-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c reductase activity derived from NADPH-P450 reductase or the fused enzyme in the microsomal fractions was measured as described previously (14Aoyama Y. Yoshida Y. Kubota S. Kumaoka H. Furumichi A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 185: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Murakami H. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H. DNA (N. Y.). 1987; 5: 1-10Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The expression plasmid pAMS25R for simultaneous expression of mic-P450c27 and yeast NADPH-P450 reductase was constructed by inserting the NotI fragment of pAMS25 containing the expression unit for mic-P450c27 into the unique NotI site of the plasmid pARR3N (10Murakami H. Yabusaki Y. Sakaki T. Shibata M. Ohkawa H. J. Biochem.(Tokyo). 1990; 108: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The plasmid pF250 for the fused enzyme between mic-P450c27 and yeast P450 reductase was constructed by adapting the procedure for the construction of pAFCR1 (17Sakaki T. Kominami S. Takemori S. Ohkawa H. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4933-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A BamHI-XhoI fragment (250 base pairs) encoding the carboxyl-terminal portion of mic-P450c27 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The resulting BamHI-XhoI fragment was doubly inserted with the HindIII-BamHI fragment prepared from pAMS25 between the HindIII and XhoI sites of pBluescript II. The plasmid pGYR encoding yeast NADPH-P450 reductase (20Yabusaki Y. Murakami H. Ohkawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was digested with PvuII to insert a linker containing an XhoI site. Both HindIII-XhoI fragments from the resulting plasmids that encode mic-P450c27 and P450 reductase, respectively, were doubly inserted into the unique HindIII site of the expression vector pAAH5N in the correct orientation. Fig. 1 schematically represents the three expression plasmids used in the present study, pAMS25 for mic-P450c27, pAMS25R for both mic-P450c27 and yeast P450 reductase, and pF250 for the fused enzyme between mic-P450c27 and yeast P450 reductase. The individual expression plasmids were introduced into S. cerevisiae AH22 cells to obtain the corresponding recombinant yeast strains. Fig. 2 shows Western blot analysis of whole cellular proteins prepared from the recombinant yeast strains. A clear band reactive with anti-mic-P450c27 antiserum was detected in both AH22/pAMS25 and AH22/pAMS25R at the position of apparent molecular mass of about 55 kDa (Fig. 2, left, lanes 2 and 3). AH22/pF250 shows a protein band reactive with both anti-mic-P450c27 antiserum and anti-P450 reductase Ig (Fig. 2, left, lane 4 and right, lane 2). The apparent molecular mass of the protein was about 130 kDa, which agrees with the structure of the fused enzyme as deduced from its cDNA sequence. The expression levels of mic-P450c27 in AH22/pAMS25 and AH22/pAMS25R and the fused enzyme in AH22/pF250 were estimated to be about 2.0, 1.6, and 1.1 × 105 molecules/cell, respectively, on the basis of reduced CO difference spectra of the recombinant yeast cells. Mic-P450c27 expressed in yeast was localized in the microsomal fraction as reported previously (8Sakaki T. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16497-16502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fused enzyme exhibited a subcellular distribution quite similar to mic-P450c27. Thus, we determined the P450 and P450 reductase contents in the yeast microsomal fractions based on reduced CO difference spectra and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity, respectively (Table I). While the P450 content in AH22/pAMS25R microsomes was slightly less than in AH22/pAMS25 microsomes, the P450 reductase content in AH22/pAMS25R microsomes was about 24-fold higher than in AH22/pAMS25 microsomes. The ratio of mic-P450c27 to P450 reductase contents was roughly estimated to be 1:0.06 and 1:1.7 in AH22/pAMS25 and AH22/pAMS25R microsomes, respectively. The AH22/pF250 microsomes exhibited the highest cytochrome c reductase activity, suggesting that the reductase portion of the fused enzyme can reduce cytochrome c more efficiently than P450 reductase itself. These results are consistent with those obtained for the fused enzyme between rat P4501A1 and yeast P450 reductase (17Sakaki T. Kominami S. Takemori S. Ohkawa H. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4933-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Table IP450 content and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity in recombinant yeast strainsStrainP450Cytochrome c reductase activitypmol/mg proteinnmol/min/mg proteinAH22/pAMS2511061AH22/pAMS25R901460AH22/pF250582640 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3A shows the reduced CO difference spectra of AH22/pAMS25 microsomes in the presence of 100 μM THC when reduced by addition of NADPH or sodium hydrosulfite. Most of mic-P450c27 in AH22/pAMS25 microsomes was reduced by NADPH within 2 min. Similarly, almost all of mic-P450c27 on the reconstituted membrane was reduced within 1 min (Fig. 3B). Thus, it seems most likely that mic-P450c27 was reduced by endogenous yeast NADPH-P450 reductase present in the microsomes. The reduction rate of the heme iron by NADPH in the presence of substrate was also examined by stopped flow analysis. The rate constant k (s−1) in AH22/pAMS25 and AH22/pAMS25R microsomes was estimated to be 0.040 and 0.67, respectively (Table II). Therefore, the reduction rate of the heme iron in mic-P450c27 was found to be roughly proportional to the yeast P450 reductase content in the microsomes. The reduction rate constant of mic-P450c27 was slightly larger than the reduction rate constant for rat microsomal P4501A1 similarly expressed in the yeast microsomes (17Sakaki T. Kominami S. Takemori S. Ohkawa H. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4933-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, the reduction rate of the heme iron of the fused enzyme was too rapid to be measured, as was the case for the fused enzyme between rat P4501A1 and yeast P450 reductase (17Sakaki T. Kominami S. Takemori S. Ohkawa H. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4933-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These results also strongly support the finding that yeast P450 reductase is an electron donor enzyme that can transfer electrons directly to mic-P450c27.Table IIReduction rate constant of mic-P450c27 and its fused enzyme in the yeast microsomesStraink(1−1)AH22/pAMS250.040 ± 0.008AH22/pAMS25R0.67 ± 0.22AH22/pF250ND Open table in a new tab We reported previously that AH22/pRXMS25 strain containing mic-P450c27 and mature forms of bovine ADX and ADR converts THC into its 27-hydroxylated product 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,27-tetrol (8Sakaki T. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16497-16502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate THC was also added to the cell culture of AH22/pAMS25R and AH22/pF250 strains. After 14 h incubation, 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,27-tetrol was detected in the culture supernatants of both strains (data not shown). Both mic-P450c27 and its fused enzyme were localized on the yeast endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Thus, the observed hydroxylation activity in the recombinant cells could depend on the electron transfer system on endoplasmic reticulum membranes and/or cytoplasm. The mitochondrial electron donor protein(s) could not be involved in the mic-P450c27-dependent activity in the cell culture of AH22/pAMS25R and AH22/pF250 strains. THC 27-hydroxylation activity in AH22/pAMS25, AH22/pAMS25R, and AH22/pF250 microsomes was further examined without addition of ADR and ADX. AH22/pAMS25R and AH22/pF250 microsomes showed a notable THC 27-hydroxylation activity, whereas AH22/pAMS25 microsomes showed little activity. The kinetic parameters, apparent Km (μM) and Vmax (mol product/min/mol P450) values, were calculated by Lineweaver-Burk plots (Table III). The kinetic parameters for AH22/pAMS25 microsomes could not be estimated because of its low activity. Mic-P450c27 and its fused enzyme had nearly the same Km values for THC, whereas the fused enzyme showed five times larger Vmax values than mic-P450c27. These results strongly suggest that the two electrons essential for the P450c27-dependent THC hydroxylation are transferred from NADPH through NADPH-P450 reductase to mic-P450c27. The Vmax value of the fused enzyme (110 min−1) was about 2-fold higher than for mic-P450c27 in the AH22/pAMS25 microsomes in the presence of ADX and ADR (8Sakaki T. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16497-16502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This high monooxygenase activity of the fused enzyme is likely due to a very efficient electron transfer from the reductase part to the P450 part of the fused enzyme. Efficient electron transfer has been observed in several fusion constructs between microsomal P450 and NADPH-P450 reductase (11Sakaki T. Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H.

The apparent Km value for THC of mic-P450c27 in the liposomes containing mic-P450c27 and the reductase (1:1 in molar ratio) was similar to that of AH22/pAMS25R microsomes, although the Vmax value was about a third of that obtained in the microsomes that contain the reductase about 1.7 times more than mic-P450c27. P450c27 was first purified from rat liver mitochondria by Okuda et al. (24Okuda K. Masumoto O. Ohyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18138-18142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who demonstrated the requirement of ADX and ADR for its activity in a reconstituted system. For the interaction of P450s with their electron donor proteins, Bernhardt and Gunsalus (25Bernhardt R. Gunsalus I.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) examined heterologous electron transfer from the bacterial electron donor putidaredoxin to rabbit microsomal P4502B4 and found very low affinity of the bacterial redoxin for the microsomal P450. Jenkins and Waterman (5Jenkins C.M. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27401-27408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the electron transfer from NADPH to heterologously expressed microsomal P450c17 through E. coli flavodoxin and flavodoxin reductase system, although the 17α-hydroxylation activity supported by the E. coli redox system was 10-fold less efficient as compared with purified rat P450 reductase. This flavodoxin and flavodoxin reductase system can be replaced by another ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase system from spinach for human P4501A2 and 3A4 expressed in E. coli (26Dong M.-S. Yamazaki H. Guo Z. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Yamazaki H. Ueng Y.-F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8380-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Recently, Black et al. (28Black S.M. Harikrishna J.A. Szklarz G.D. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7247-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) reported the monooxygenase activity of the fusion construct of P450scc with NADPH-P450 reductase expressed in COS-1 cells, although the mitochondrial localization of the fused enzyme was absolutely required for its activity. However, because the mitochondrial fraction of COS-1 cells contains an electron transfer system consisting of ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase, any other protein(s) than P450 reductase may participate in the electron transfer from NADPH to P450scc part. Thus, no direct evidence has been reported for heterologous electron transfer from the microsomal electron donor P450 reductase to mitochondrial P450. On the expression of mic-P450c27 in yeast, we have previously concluded that endogenous yeast NADPH-P450 reductase was insufficient for mic-P450c27 to show monooxygenase activity, because 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 25-hydroxylation activity could not be detected without the addition of both ADX and ADR (8Sakaki T. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16497-16502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, to our surprise, stopped flow analysis revealed that the reduction rate of mic-P450c27 heme iron in AH22/pAMS25 microsomes is somewhat more rapid than that observed for rat P4501A1 in AH22/pAMC1 microsomes (17Sakaki T. Kominami S. Takemori S. Ohkawa H. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4933-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the existence of the electron donor protein(s) to mic-P450c27 on the yeast microsomal membrane. In order to confirm the electron transfer from NADPH-P450 reductase to mic-P450c27, we first constructed the simultaneous expression plasmid pAMS25R for mic-P450c27 and yeast P450 reductase. The resulting AH22/pAMS25R strain contained a 24-fold increased amount of the reductase as compared with AH22/pAMS25 cells. The reduction rate of mic-P450c27 heme iron in AH22/pAMS25R microsomes was 17-fold more rapid than mic-P450c27 in AH22/pAMS25 microsomes, roughly in proportion to the reductase content. In addition, AH22/pAMS25R microsomes showed THC 27-hydroxylation activity without addition of ADX and ADR. These results strongly support our hypothesis that mic-P450c27 can accept two electrons from P450 reductase in the P450 reaction cycle. Next, we constructed the fused enzyme between mic-P450c27 and yeast NADPH-P450 reductase to further investigate the electron transfer from NADPH through P450 reductase to mic-P450c27. The rate of the first electron transfer from NADPH to the heme iron was too rapid to be measured, as was the case for the fused enzyme between rat P4501A1 and yeast P450 reductase (17Sakaki T. Kominami S. Takemori S. Ohkawa H. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4933-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, the fused enzyme showed a 5-fold higher THC 27-hydroxylation activity than mic-P450c27 in AH22/pAMS25R microsomes. These observations also strongly suggested the direct electron transfer from the reductase part to the heme iron in the mic-P450c27 part of the fused enzyme. To exclude the possibility of contamination of other electron transfer proteins in the yeast microsomes, mic-P450c27 was purified from the recombinant yeast microsomes. The purified preparation of mic-P450c27 in the liposomal membranes reconstituted with yeast P450 reductase showed a significant THC 27-hydroxylation activity. This is clear evidence that electrons are transferred directly from NADPH to mic-P450c27 through P450 reductase. The discrepancy between the observation of Okuda et al. (24Okuda K. Masumoto O.

As compared with the reconstituted system used by Okuda et al. (24Okuda K. Masumoto O. Ohyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18138-18142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we employed equal or more amounts of yeast P450 reductase for the reconstitution of the liposomal membranes and for coexpression in the present study. Mic-P450c27 has the microsomal targeting signal derived from bovine microsomal P450c17 that is absent in the mature form of native mitochondrial P450c27. Therefore, it seems likely that the amino-terminal hydrophobic sequence of mic-P450c27 plays an important role not only in its localization to the microsomal membrane but also in its membrane topology resulting in efficient interaction with NADPH-P450 reductase. The redox potential of mitochondrial P450s is quite similar to that of microsomal P450s. Therefore, in the view of electrochemistry there is no difficulty for the electron transfer from P450 reductase to mitochondrial P450s if they can properly interact with each other (29Lambeth J.D. Pember S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The direct electron transfer from microsomal P450 reductase to mic-P450c27 is also of interest from the evolutionary aspect of P450 superfamily. Comparison of primary structures of more than 200 P450 species revealed that microsomal P450s have diverged from an ancestral form of a soluble bacterial P450 and mitochondrial P450s then evolved from a microsomal P450 (7Nebert D.W. Nelson D.R. Estabrook R.W. Feyereisen R. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Gonzalez F. Guengerich F.P. Gunsalus I.C. Johnson E.F. Loper J.C. Sato R. Waterman M.R. Waxman D.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). We substantiated the conversion of P450c27 localization from mitochondria to microsomes by altering its amino-terminal targeting signal (8Sakaki T. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16497-16502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showing that only the amino-terminal sequences of 20-40 residues decide its subcellular localization. On the other hand, the conversion of the electron transport chain from class I (bacteria) to class II (microsomes), and then back again to class I (mitochondria), accompanied with the change in subcellular localization could not have been clearly explained. As shown in the previous (8Sakaki T. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16497-16502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and present reports, mic-P450c27 is an example that accepts electrons from both class I and class II electron donors. Accordingly, it is very plausible that P450c27 is located at the divergence point between microsomal and mitochondrial P450s. It is noteworthy that P450c27 appears most closely related to microsomal P450 in evolution (31Nelson D.R. Kamataki T. Waxman D.J. Guengerich F.P. Estabrook R.W. Feyereisen R. Gonzalez F.J. Coon M.J. Gunsalus I.C. Gotoh O. Okuda K. Nebert D.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Jenkins and Waterman (5Jenkins C.M. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27401-27408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) discussed the evolution of eukaryotic P450 reductase based on the result of electron transfer capability of E. coli flavodoxin and flavodoxin system to microsomal P450c17. Flavodoxin and NADPH-flavodoxin reductase in E. coli show some similarity in their sequences to NADPH-P450 reductase within regions of functional importance (5Jenkins C.M. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27401-27408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that P450 reductase evolved from a bacterial flavodoxin and flavodoxin reductase system by a fusion event (5Jenkins C.M. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27401-27408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Porter T.D. Kasper C.B.

In this report, we applied the similar technique to construct a fused enzyme between mitochondrial P450 with an amino-terminal hydrophobic sequence and microsomal NADPH-P450 reductase. Thus, this novel technique for construction of a highly active single chain enzyme consisting of mitochondrial P450 and microsomal P450 reductase would be very useful to study structure-function analysis of P450 monooxygenases.

In order to identify structural domains that may confer the different substrate specificities between HL and LPL, we have utilized a novel approach for performing structure-function analysis of a protein, in vivo, by using recombinant adenovirus vectors to express native and mutant enzymes in an animal model for a human genetic deficiency. HL-deficient mice (n = 19) characterized by increased plasma cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations were injected with adenovirus expressing luciferase (rLucif-AdV), native hepatic (rHL-AdV), and lipoprotein lipase (rLPL-AdV) or lipase mutants in which the lid covering the catalytic site of either enzyme was exchanged (rHL+LPL lid-AdV and rLPL+HL lid-AdV). Mice injected with rLucif-AdV had no changes in post-heparin HL and LPL activities (217 ± 29 and 7 ± 2 nmol/min/ml, respectively) as well as plasma lipids. Despite expression of similar levels of post-heparin plasma lipase activity on day 5 post-adenovirus infusion (9806 ± 915 and 9677 ± 2033 nmol/min/ml, respectively) mice injected with rHL-AdV or rHL+LPL lid-AdV demonstrated marked differences in the reduction of plasma phospholipids (70% and 32%, respectively, p < 0.005). Similarly, despite post-heparin plasma lipolytic activities of 4495 ± 534 and 4844 ± 1336 nmol/min/ml, injection of rLPL-AdV or rLPL+HL lid-AdV resulted in phospholipid reductions of 31% and 81% (p < 0.005). Exchange of the lipase lid did not significantly alter plasma triglyceride concentrations. Thus, preferential in vivo hydrolysis of phospholipids was demonstrated in animals expressing lipases containing the HL lid but not the LPL lid. These studies identify the lipase lid as a major structural motif responsible for conferring the different in vivo phospholipase activities between HL and LPL, a function which may modulate the distinct physiological roles of these two similar lipolytic enzymes in lipoprotein metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2060553590,"Most biological fluids are supersaturated with calcium salts. A mechanism controlling crystal growth is therefore necessary to prevent excessive precipitation and development of a lithiasis. In pancreatic juice, calcite precipitation is prevented by lithostathine, a glycoprotein that inhibits calcite crystal growth. We describe here the interaction of lithostathine with calcite crystals. Without lithostathine, calcite crystals grew as rhombohedra showing six {101¯4} faces. At low concentration (1 μM), lithostathine already altered crystal growth by generating new {112¯0} faces. At physiological concentrations (3-10 μM), adsorption resulted in a transition from rhombohedral to sub-cubic habits. Immunochemical localization demonstrated that, although all {101¯4} faces are equivalent, lithostathine binding was restricted to the face edges distal to the c axis. Scanning electron microscopy showed that, at the site of lithostathine binding, spreading of new CaCO3 layers during crystal growth was arrested before reaching the crystal diad axis-bearing edges. The successive kinks generated during crystal growth formed the new, striated {112¯0} faces. Similar modifications were observed with the N-terminal undecapeptide of lithostathine that bears the inhibitory activity. With 100 μM lithostathine, {112¯0} faces could reach the c axis outcrop of the former rhombohedron, resulting in an olive-shaped crystal. Finally, the number of crystals increased and their average size decreased when lithostathine concentration increased from 0.1 to 100 μM. Decreased Ca2+ concentration during crystal growth was delayed in the presence of lithostathine. It was concluded that lithostathine controls lithogenesis 1) by triggering germination of numerous calcite crystals and 2) by inhibiting the rate of Ca2+ ion apposition on the nuclei and therefore interfering with the apposition of new layers on calcite. Formation of smaller crystals, whose elimination is easier, is thereby favored. Most biological fluids are supersaturated with calcium salts.

Formation of smaller crystals, whose elimination is easier, is thereby favored. Biological fluids are generally supersaturated with respect to a calcium salt, such as oxalate in urine, phosphate in saliva, and carbonate in bile or pancreatic juice. As a result, formation of calcium salt crystals occurs spontaneously. This can be beneficial, as in the process of tooth or bone mineralization. However, it might become harmful if continuous crystal growth is allowed, leading to the formation of stones and the development of lithiasis. It is therefore essential that the precipitation of these salts is controlled. Stabilization of fluids is mainly ensured by protein inhibitors of nucleation, growth, and aggregation of crystals. Several inhibitors have been described, such as statherine in saliva (1Hay D.I. Arch. Oral Biol. 1973; 18: 1531-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), nephrocalcin in urine (2Nakagawa Y. Abram V. Kezdy F.J. Kaiser E.T. Coe F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12594-12600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), gallstone protein in bile (3Shimitzu S. Sabsay B. Veis A. Ostrow J.D.

Lafont H. Lombardo D. Sarles H. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Lithostathine is a glycoprotein of 144 amino acids, showing a structural homology with C-type lectins, and synthesized by pancreatic acinar cells (5Dagorn J.C. Go V.L. Di Magno E.P. Gardner J.D.

It is a powerful inhibitor of CaCO3 crystal nucleation and growth in vitro (6Multigner L. De Caro A. Lombardo D. Campese D. Sarles H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Measurements of lithostathine mRNA concentration in healthy subjects and patients presenting with chronic calcifying pancreatitis, a lithogenic disorder leading to the formation of pancreatic calculi (8Edmonson H.A. Bullock W.K. Mehl J.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1950; 26: 37-55PubMed Google Scholar), showed a marked decrease in patients (9Giorgi D. Bernard J.-P. Rouquier S. Iovanna J. Sarles H. Dagorn J.-C. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). With lithostathine being the only protein from pancreatic juice with inhibitory activity on CaCO3 crystal growth, these results suggest that it is a key factor in the prevention of stone formation in pancreatic ducts. The present work is aimed at determining the consequences of lithostathine binding onto calcite crystals. Our results led us to propose a model of calcite growth inhibition by lithostathine. Lithostathine, a gift of Dr. J. P. Bernard, was purified from pancreatic juice of patients without chronic calcifying pancreatitis, using the procedure previously described by Montalto et al. (10Montalto G. Bonicel J. Multigner L. Rovery M. Sarles H. De Caro A. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Antibodies against lithostathine were raised in rabbit according to De Caro et al. (4De Caro A. Multigner L. Lafont H. Lombardo D. Sarles H. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The N-terminal undecapeptide of lithostathine, pyroEEAQTELPQAR, was synthesized at the Biotechnology Service Center (Toronto). RNase A and proteinase K were from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany), and concanavalin A was from Sigma. We used a variant of the method originally described by Gruzenski (11Gruzenski P.M. J. Phys. Chem. Solids G. B. 1967; 1: 365-367Google Scholar). Briefly, CaCO3 crystals were grown by slow diffusion, in a dessicator, of CO2 gas from the dissociation of hydrated (NH4)2CO3 vapor into wells containing 100 μl of 7.5 mM CaCl2, pH 8, for 2 days. The slow diffusion of carbonate ions into the CaCl2 solution allows the formation of the most stable CaCO3 polymorph, i.e. calcite, at the air-water interface. The pH was checked throughout the experiment and was shown to remain between 7 and 7.5. Using the above mentioned technique, the effect of lithostathine on crystal morphology was examined by adding appropriate amounts of protein, ranging from 0.1 to 100 μM, to filtered 7.5 mM CaCl2, pH 8, prior to the onset of crystallization. Controls without lithostathine or with several other control proteins were run in parallel. Calcite crystals were then observed by optical microscopy. Crystals obtained in the presence of 1 μM lithostathine were recovered, dried, and observed by scanning electron microscopy. The same experiments were run with the N-terminal undecapeptide of lithostathine that bears the inhibitory activity on CaCO3 crystal growth (7Bernard J.-P. Adrich Z. Montalto G. De Caro A. De Reggi M. Sarles H. Dagorn J.-C. Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1277-1284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), except that peptide concentration ranged from 10 μM to 10 mM. Crystals grown in the presence of 1 mM peptide were subsequently observed by scanning electron microscopy. Control experiments were performed with three proteins apparently devoid of activity on crystal growth. RNase A, proteinase K, and concanavalin A were used at concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 μM. Free Ca2+ ion concentrations in the supersaturated solution was monitored during crystal growth in the absence or in the presence of 3 μM lithostathine. Briefly, 10-μl aliquots were withdrawn at different time intervals and mixed to 5 ml of Ca2+-depleted water. The Ca2+ concentration was measured with an ionization flame atomic absorption spectrometer (SpectrAA-20, Varian, Australia). A standard reference curve with a known amount of Ca2+ was made in the same conditions. Specific binding of lithostathine onto calcite crystals was determined by immunofluorescence as follows. Calcite crystals formed in the presence of 1 μM lithostathine were washed twice with 100 μl of 7.5 mM CaCl2, pH 8. Then, calcite crystals were incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti-serum to lithostathine diluted 10 times with 50 μl of 7.5 mM CaCl2, pH 8. Wells were then washed with 100 μl of the CaCl2 solution and incubated for 1 h with anti-rabbit fluoresceine isothiocyanate-labeled goat antibodies, diluted at 1/160, in 50 μl of the CaCl2 solution. After several washes, crystals were observed under a fluorescence microscope. Controls with or without lithostathine or antibodies were run and treated in parallel. Optical microscopy examination was performed with an Orthomat microscope (Leitz Wetzlar, Germany) at magnifications up to ×200. Scanning electron microscopy analysis was carried out using a Jeol 35C microscope, operated at 25 kV. Dried crystal batches were mounted on metal stubs, coated with a thin gold layer of about 600-800 Å by ion sputtering. The resolution was 60 Å. The micrographs were produced with secondary electrons. Crystals were observed at magnification up to ×10,000. Immunofluorescence experiments were performed on an optical microscope Dialux (Leitz) coupled with a PLOEM system for epifluorescence. Crystals were observed at a magnification of ×40. Fig. 1 shows the aspect of calcite crystals grown in the presence of various concentrations of lithostathine. Without protein (0 μM), calcite crystals grew as perfect 1Crystal planes are denoted by the Miller indices h,k,i, andl, which define their orientation relative to the crystal axes. rhombohedra, as confirmed by measurement of obtuse angles (102°) between face edges, until they reached 100 μm in size, which is the maximum size reached by calcite crystals in our conditions of supersaturation. When the crystals had reached this size, further growth was not possible because all free Ca2+ initially available had precipitated, and the solution had become saturated with respect to the calcite. Minute amounts of lithostathine (0.1 μM) already affected crystal morphology, one of the upper edges being altered (see arrow). A smooth face progressively became a rough face. When the lithostathine concentration was raised to 1 μM, this effect was more pronounced, and we observed a progressive roughening of two edges of each rhombic face (see arrows). At 2 μM, crystals were profoundly affected, losing their rhombohedral shape. Single crystals converted to crystal aggregates. From 1 to 3 μM, we observed a habit transition from rhombohedral to sub-cubic. This was confirmed by interedge angle measurement that gave roughly 90° (see arrow in the 4 μM panel). With 4 μM lithostathine, some twins appeared. These structures, resulting from the interpenetration of two cubes, are characteristic of calcite (see arrow in the 3 μM panel). When protein concentration was increased to 10 μM, which is the physiological concentration, monocrystal habits disappeared, giving place to small aggregates. The size of crystals, measured in linear dimensions, was also considerably affected by lithostathine. They were approximately eight times smaller with 4 μM lithostathine than in the control. Maximal effect was observed for lithostathine concentrations up to 100 μM. In this case, crystals totally lost their original shape and displayed an “olive” shape. Finally, another important finding was that increasing lithostathine concentration led to an increase in the number of crystals formed. Controls were performed with 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 μM RNase A, proteinase K, or concanavalin A. From 0 to 10 μM, calcite crystals were not affected by these proteins, displaying their typical rhombohedric shape (not shown). Also, in contrast to lithostathine (at 100 μM), no nucleation (i.e. no crystals appeared) was detected. Fig. 2 shows experiments where calcite was grown in the presence of the synthetic N-terminal undecapeptide of lithostathine (L11). Below 500 μM of peptide, calcite crystals kept their perfect crystalline shape. At 500 μM and 1 mM, the effect on crystal growth was very similar to that observed with the whole protein. This is particularly visible with 1 mM of L11 (see arrows). Interestingly, a peptide concentration of 10 mM totally prevented crystal formation in our experimental conditions. These observations confirm that L11 is capable of inhibiting crystal growth (7Bernard J.-P. Adrich Z. Montalto G. De Caro A. De Reggi M. Sarles H. Dagorn J.-C. Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1277-1284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), as lithostathine does, although similar effects require at least a concentration 100 times higher.Fig. 2Effect of various concentrations of lithostathine N-terminal undecapeptide on calcite crystal morphology. Experiments were realized under light microscopy at magnification up to ×100. The horizontal bar corresponds to 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown on Fig. 3, nucleation was very fast in the absence of lithostathine and occurred within 30 min (C). Crystal growth was completed in about 2 h, 30 min, when the limit of solubility had been reached. In the presence of lithostathine (L), the number of neo-formed crystals increased. This is strengthened by the counting of crystals at the bottom of the wells (Table I) that clearly shows an increased number of neo-formed calcite crystals when increasing lithostathine concentration. These results show that the protein slowed down crystal growth and increased the rate of crystal nucleation. Furthermore, as already observed in Fig. 1, calcite crystals displayed a more rounded shape and were approximately two times smaller, compared to control (C). Monitoring Ca2+ concentration with time in the supersaturation solution showed that, after a short induction period (of approximately 30 min) where no nucleation is detected, calcite crystal nucleation appears, essentially followed by a growth phase. In the presence of 3 μM lithostathine, the decrease in Ca2+ is delayed, compared to control, during the first 8 h (Fig. 4).Table I.Estimation of the number of calcite crystals formed from a supersaturated CaCO3 solution, in the presence of various concentration of lithostathineLithostathine concentrationAverage number of crystals/unit areaμM03.8 ± 1.220.14 ± 115.33 ± 1.53213.33 ± 1.53425.67 ± 2.081157.33 ± 2.52100aIn this case, the total number of calcite crystals is very difficult to assess because most of them are agglomerates of numerous monocrystals.>100a In this case, the total number of calcite crystals is very difficult to assess because most of them are agglomerates of numerous monocrystals. Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Influence of lithostathine on the decrease in free Ca2+ concentration during crystal growth from a supersaturated solution of CaCO3. Experimental conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Free Ca2+ concentration was measured at different times in the absence (□) or in the presence (▪) of 3 μM lithostathine. Each point represents the mean value for three determinations. The standard deviation of the mean was always less than 0.01 mg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The intrinsic fluorescence of calcite crystals was checked in the absence of lithostathine and antibodies. A very weak emission of fluorescence was detected all around the crystal, representing 5% of the fluorescence obtained with the complete reaction (not shown). To test for nonspecific binding of antibodies, we incubated crystals in the absence of lithostathine. In these conditions, we found that fluorescence represented 10% of the total fluorescence (not shown). Conversely, when crystals were incubated with lithostathine, a specific fluorescence was detected on the adjacent faces of the crystal (Fig. 5) whose structure was altered. These results are in good agreement with those obtained from Fig. 1 and indicate that alterations actually correspond to the region of lithostathine binding. Fig. 6A shows the perfect rhombohedral shape of calcite crystal bounded by the {101¯4} form as indexed in the hexagonal setting (Fig. 6D). When incubated with lithostathine (Fig. 6, B and C), they developed new, rough, and striated adjacent faces, belonging to the {112¯0} form (Fig. 6, E and F). The top and adjacent edges of the rhombohedron were not affected. Considering the trigonal and diad axes of calcite, which determine specific symmetry properties, these observations suggest the existence of six newly born faces belonging to the {112¯0} form. This is partly shown on Fig. 6B with the {2¯110} face. Thus, the inhibition of growth by lithostathine occurs by generating new faces organized as a “zigzag” ring running normal to the triad axis (see also Fig. 8). With the progressive arrest of growth, the steps stacked on each other, thereby forming macrosteps close to the upper edge of the {112¯0} faces (the intersection of two contiguous edges linked by the obtuse angle). Striated facets appeared on such angles. Fig. 7 also shows details of the microtopography of the new prismatic faces. They are striated along the c axis and are formed by the bunching of rough steps issued from the rhombohedral faces.Fig. 8Model of calcite crystal growth in the presence of lithostathine.

The horizontal bar corresponds to 1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate the mechanism by which lithostathine inhibits calcite crystal growth, we analyzed the modifications of crystal morphology induced by the binding of the protein. When crystals form from a supersaturated solution of a given salt, they exhibit a particular shape, depending on the solvent, on salt supersaturation and on the presence of impurities in the solution. In our conditions, calcite always formed rhombohedral crystals with six {101¯4} faces (12Addadi L. Weiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4110-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). However, if the solution is not pure, crystal habits will be disturbed if the contaminating substances can interfere with the successive deposition of salt molecules onto the crystal nucleus. In a calcite rhombohedron, the atomic composition of all six faces is identical and isotropic. Therefore, binding of an impurity with affinity for the surface of the crystal will occur at random, and further growth will result in a crystal with irregular shape. This is not what occurs with lithostathine. Observation of crystals grown in the presence of 1 μM lithostathine revealed that the structure of the rhombohedron faces was retained near the emergence point of the c axis and that apposition of new CaCO3 layers on these faces had been halted before the edge of the previous layer was reached, with formation of a festoon border of steps (Fig. 7). Adsorption of the protein was therefore non-random, preferential binding to the edges of growing layers being evidenced by immunolocalization (Fig. 5). When calcite crystals were grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of lithostathine, a transition from the rhombohedral to the cubic habit was observed (Fig. 1), followed by a transition to an olive-shaped habit when protein concentration reached 100 μM. The successive steps form new groove-like faces parallel to the {112¯0} set of lattice planes. Hence, with lithostathine concentrations in the 5 μM range, the crystal showed a sub-cubic habit with six {101¯4} faces and six {112¯0} faces. With increasing lithostathine concentrations, the size of the {112¯0} faces increased at the expense of the original {101¯4} faces, resulting ultimately in the formation of olive-shaped crystals. Close examination by scanning electron microscopy revealed that the newly formed {112¯0} faces presented with macrosteps heavily corrugated in response to protein adsorption. Step sources on {101¯4} faces can be considered to be screw dislocation(s) emanating from the regular occurrence of one to a few growth hillocks located at random on each face (13Staudt W.J. Reeder R.J. Schoonen M.A.A. Geochem. Cosmochem. Acta. 1994; 58: 2087-2098Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this case, a strong anisotropy of step velocities and microstructures (kink site content, bunching) would occur, as observed on synthetic calcite grown from trace metal-bearing solutions by Paquette and Reeder (14Paquette J. Reeder R.J. Geochem. Cosmochem. Acta. 1995; 59: 735-749Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The two upper step directions parallel to the upper edges of the cleavage rhombohedron would belong to regular trains of elementary steps, thus resulting in a rather smooth upper part of the growth pyramid close to the inverse triad axis outcrop. The two lower ones, conversely, would bunch (each thus forming macrosteps) and would become heavily corrugated in response to the protein preferential adsorption there. Increasing protein concentration would therefore promote the appearance of the heavily striated {112¯0} form on the calcite habit, in the same manner as metal adsorption operates (14Paquette J. Reeder R.J. Geochem. Cosmochem. Acta. 1995; 59: 735-749Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar). However, with inorganic cations (Mg2+, Mn2+, and Sr2+) or anions (SO2−4 and SeO2−4) (13Staudt W.J. Reeder R.J. Schoonen M.A.A. Geochem. Cosmochem. Acta. 1994; 58: 2087-2098Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 14Paquette J. Reeder R.J. Geochem. Cosmochem. Acta. 1995; 59: 735-749Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar), 2R. Reeder, personal communication. additional {011¯2} faces appear, which is not the case with lithostathine. Therefore, the role of lithostathine adsorption on calcite habit is similar but not identical to that of inorganic ions. With the latter, inhibition is attributed to their incorporation into the crystal (15Abbona F. Boistelle R. J. Crystal Growth. 1979; 46: 339-354Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Boistelle R. Abbona F. J. Crystal Growth. 1981; 54: 275-295Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which is not observed nor expected with lithostathine owing to the huge size of the molecule. Arrest of growth is probably obtained when the number of lithostathine molecules bound to the growing edge and carried along during layer extension is sufficient to prevent further apposition of calcium and carbonate ions. The rate of lithostathine binding being a direct function of its concentration, the size of the {101¯4} faces should decrease when concentration increases, which is consistent with our observations (Fig. 1). That hypothesis of a steric hindrance is further supported by experiments in which calcite crystal were grown in the presence of the N-terminal undecapeptide (L11) of lithostathine (Fig. 2). L11 was previously shown to inhibit CaCO3 crystal growth in vitro, in experiments where a metastable solutions of CaCO3 was seeded with calcite crystals (7Bernard J.-P. Adrich Z. Montalto G. De Caro A. De Reggi M. Sarles H. Dagorn J.-C. Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1277-1284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Efficacy of the natural (glycosylated) and synthetic (non-glycosylated) L11 were approximately 100 and 200 times lower compared with lithostathine. Because of the smaller size and bulk of L11 peptide, it would offer less steric hindrance to new accretion than the much larger intact molecule and, therefore, more molecules would be needed to obtain the same degree of inhibition. In the present conditions, crystals grown in the presence of 1 μM lithostathine or 500 μM synthetic L11 showed similar alterations in morphology. Altogether, these observations suggest that, in our experimental conditions, calcite growth occurs by successive apposition of new CaCO3 layers starting from the two emergence points of the c axis of the rhombohedron. Inhibition by lithostathine results from binding to the edges of the growing layers, generating six new, identical {112¯0} faces organized as a chair-like structure (Fig. 8). On the other hand, these experiments showed that, besides affecting crystal growth, lithostathine also triggered crystal nucleation. The number of crystals formed from a solution with a given supersaturation increased in the presence of lithostathine, while their average volume decreased (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). This comes in apparent discrepancy with a previous report from our laboratory that lithostathine inhibited calcite nucleation (7Bernard J.-P. Adrich Z. Montalto G. De Caro A. De Reggi M. Sarles H. Dagorn J.-C. Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1277-1284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In those experiments we had assumed that the initial rates of crystal growth reflected the nucleation rates, as already published in studies with other inhibitors (for example, see 17Hay D.I. Moreno E.C. Schlesinger D.H. Inorg. Persp. Biol. Med. 1979; 2: 271-285Google Scholar). In fact, this is not true when the molecule suspected of altering the nucleation rate is an inhibitor of crystal growth (for a review, see 18Boistelle R. Mutaftschiev B. Interfacial Aspects of Phase Transformations. D. Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht1982: 621Crossref Google Scholar). On the contrary, visual monitoring of the number of crystals formed gives an appropriate estimate of the frequency of nucleation. Observation that lithostathine triggers nucleation suggests that the control of CaCO3 calculi formation is a two-step mechanism. First, lithostathine serves as a substrate for heterogeneous nucleation, resulting in the formation of numerous calcite crystallites. Then, by adsorption onto neo-formed faces, it slows down the rate of Ca2+ ion apposition on the nuclei and, consequently, the crystal growth rate. Interference with both nucleation and growth rate of CaCO3 crystals seem to be characteristics of lithostathine because we observed that three control proteins did not influence nucleation and growth (not shown), and we had previously demonstrated that lithostathine was the only protein in pancreatic secretion that could inhibit calcite crystal growth (7Bernard J.-P. Adrich Z. Montalto G. De Caro A. De Reggi M. Sarles H. Dagorn J.-C. Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1277-1284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Bernard J.P. Adrich Z. Montalto G. Multigner L. Dagorn J.C. Sarles H. De Caro A. Pancreas. 1991; 6: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In vivo, the ionic and protein composition of the milieu is more complex than in our in vitro system. However, there is in pancreatic ducts a continuous flow of Ca2+ and lithostathine secreted by the acinar cells. In these conditions, we can consider that lithostathine and newly formed crystals are static with regard to the flow. They flow together and interact as they would if they were in a motionless environment. As a consequence, this in vitro system, although simplified, might reflect the in vivo situation. Therefore, the role of lithostathine in pancreatic juice would be to induce formation of numerous small calcite crystals that can be easily washed out by juice flow. Control of CaCO3 crystal growth in other supersaturated biological fluids that contain protein inhibitors similar to lithostathine might be exerted by a similar mechanism. We are indebted to L. Addadi and R. J. Reeder for helpful comments and suggestions. We thank A. Ragon for help in the measurements of free calcium concentrations."

Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). PAI-2, a bone fide member of the plasminogen activator enzyme system, controls the enzymatic activity of urokinase (u-PA) and to a lesser extent, of tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA). This poorly secreted protein does not contain any typical signal sequence, whereas recent reports showed that PAI-2 readily polymerizes in the cells, which further reduces the efficiency of PAI-2 secretion (Mikus and Ny, 21Mikus P. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10048-10053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A potential intracellular role for PAI-2 was proposed over a decade ago, but only in relatively recent times has such a possibility been directly investigated. Recent in vitro evidence shows that PAI-2 is involved in keratinocyte differentiation (Jensen et al., 14Jensen P.J. Wu Q.Y. Janowitz P. Ando Y. Schechter N.M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1995; 217: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas other groups have suggested a modulatory role for PAI-2 in the control of apoptosis (Kumar and Baglioni, 15Kumar S.

Constitutive levels of PAI-2 mRNAs and protein are low, even undetectable in most cell systems investigated, but they can be profoundly induced by growth factors, phorbol esters, and inhibitors of protein phosphatases. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is the most impressive physiological regulator of PAI-2. This inflammatory mediator modulates various endothelial cell functions relevant to thrombosis, hemostasis, and fibrinolysis and activates coagulation in vivo (van der Poll et al., 34van der Poll T. Buller H.R. Ten Cate H. Wortel C.H. Bauer K.A. van Deventer S.J.H. Hack E. Sauerwein H.P. Rosenberg R.D. ten Cate J.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1622-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In endothelial and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells, TNF profoundly increases expression of both the PAI-1 and PAI-2 genes but simultaneously suppresses t-PA expression (Medcalf et al., 19Medcalf R.L.

The response of the PAI-2 gene to TNF and other agents, including PMA and okadaic acid, involves transcriptional events (Schleuning et al., 30Schleuning W.D. Medcalf R.L. Hession C. Rothenbuhler R.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12220-12226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recent PAI-2 expression analyses have provided evidence for a complex regulatory control between repressor and activator domains within the proximal and distal promoter regions (see Dear and Medcalf (8Dear A.E. Medcalf R.L. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 321-330Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) for review). Although transcriptional processes are strongly involved in the control of PAI-2 gene expression, a potential contribution of PAI-2 mRNA stabilization in its net regulation has received relatively little attention. The 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of PAI-2 mRNA harbors a number of potentially important AU-rich motifs including the nonameric sequence, UUAUUUAUU. Such AU-rich motifs in general (Shaw and Kamen, 31Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar), and the nonameric motif in particular (Lagnado et al., 16Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar; Zubiaga et al., 37Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), independently promote mRNA destabilization in different mammalian systems, but their influence in the turnover of PAI-2 mRNA is unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that treatment of HT-1080 cells with a combination of TNF and PMA produces a selective and powerful synergistic induction of PAI-2 gene expression. We provide evidence that this regulation requires both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. Using the rabbit β-globin as a reporter gene, we show that the 3′-UTR of PAI-2 mRNA is inherently unstable but can confer stabilization to chimeric reporter genes when stably transfected cells are treated with TNF and PMA. We also demonstrate that the nonameric AU-rich motif in the 3′-UTR is involved in inherent PAI-2 mRNA destabilization. Our results indicate that the concerted action of TNF and PMA on PAI-2 gene expression is a complex phenomenon, requiring the engagement of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. Human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured to confluence at 37°C in 10-cm diameter cell culture dishes according to standard techniques in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Australia). Cell treatments were conducted in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without 50 ng/ml recombinant human TNF (kindly donated by Dr. Wolf-Dieter Schleuning, Schering AG, Berlin, FRG) or 25 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma). The transcription inhibitors, actinomycin D and 5,6-dichloro-1-β-Δ-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole (DRB) were obtained from Sigma and used at a final concentration of 5 and 20 μg/ml, respectively. The plasmids pCMVglo and pCMVglo-uPA were kindly provided by Dr. Yoshikuni Nagamine (Friedrich Miescher Institute, Basel, Switzerland). pCMVglo contains the rabbit β-globin gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. pCMVglo-uPA is identical to pCMVglo but contains the 3′-UTR of the pig u-PA gene inserted into the 3′-end of the β-globin 3′-UTR (Nanbu et al., 23Nanbu R. Menoud P.-A. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4920-4928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chimeric β-globin-PAI-2 constructs were generated by PCR amplification of different regions of the PAI-2 3′-UTR and insertion of the corresponding fragments into the XhoI site of pCMVglo (see Fig. 6). The orientation of the inserts was determined by restriction mapping and sequencing. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for these procedures are provided in the legend of Fig. 6. Site-directed mutagenesis of the AU-rich nonameric sequence within the 3′-UTR region of PAI-2 was performed using the Transformer DNA kit (Clontech), following the manufacturer's instructions. The mutagenic primer was designed to insert a HindIII restriction site into the core element of the AU-rich motif, effectively creating a 4-bp substitution (underlined below). The selection primer was designed to replace the ApaI restriction site (upstream of the XhoI site) in the pCMVglo-PAI-2 template plasmid with a restriction site for EcoRV. These oligonucleotides have the following sequences: mutagenic primer, 5′-CTTTGTTAAAGCTTATTTTATATAATGG-3′; selection primer, 5′-GTCCAAACCGATATCCTCTGCTAAC-3′. Stable transfections of DNA into HT-1080 cells were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure (Sambrook et al., 28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.30Google Scholar). 20 μg of plasmid DNA (pCMVglo, or variations thereof) were co-precipitated with 2 μg of the pNTneo vector carrying a neomycin resistance gene under the control of the CMV promoter (kindly provided by Dr. Phil Bird, Monash University, Australia). Transfected cells were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 600 μg/ml G418 (Boehringer Mannheim), and resistant colonies (at least 200) were pooled by trypsinization. The method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (6Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) was used to purify total RNA from the transfected HT-1080 cells. Unless indicated otherwise, 10 μg of RNA were loaded to each lane and electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel containing 20% formaldehyde and then transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham, Sydney, Australia). The filters were hybridized overnight at 42°C in a 50% formamide buffer (Medcalf et al., 18Medcalf R.L. Richards R.I. Crawford R.J. Hamilton J.A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2217-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) containing the 32P-labeled cDNA probes. After hybridization, the membranes were processed by standard techniques and exposed to Kodak BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70°C with an intensifying screen. Labeled inserts used for Northern hybridizations were obtained as follows: the 0.38-kb BamHI/HindIII fragment of pGEMglo containing exon 2 of the rabbit β-globin (Vakalopoulou et al., 33Vakalopoulou E.

Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar) and modified by Medcalf et al. (20Medcalf R.L. Van den Berg E. Schleuning W.D. J. Cell. Biol. 1988; 108: 971-978Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar), using nuclei extracted from 107 cells. The plasmid pGEMglo was denatured by boiling for 10 min in the presence of 100 mM NaOH and fixed to nitrocellulose using a HYBRI-SLOT Manifold slot-blot apparatus (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two micrograms of DNA were applied per slot. Filter strips were hybridized with labeled RNA for 36 h at 65°C and then washed, RNase-treated, air-dried, and exposed to x-ray film for up to 10 days. The cytoplasmic extracts obtained from HT-1080 cells during the preparation of nuclei (above), were retained for the quantitation of PAI-2 antigen using a PAI-2-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Biopool, Umea, Sweden). PAI-2 antigen levels were expressed as ng of PAI-2 antigen/mg of total cell-associated protein. Total protein concentrations of cell extracts were determined by the Bio-Rad protein dye reagent (Bio-Rad, Sydney, Australia). HT-1080 cells were treated for 24 h with 50 ng/ml TNF or 25 ng/ml PMA, added alone or in combination. Northern blot experiments show that both PAI-1 and PAI-2 mRNA levels increase while, as previously reported (Medcalf et al., 19Medcalf R.L. Kruithof E.K.O. Schleuning W.D. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), t-PA gene expression is reduced (Fig. 1). However, markedly different responses are observed when both drugs are added in combination. In this situation, PAI-2 mRNA levels are increased in a profound synergistic manner (greater than 200-fold as assessed by densitometric analysis of the autoradiogram), whereas PAI-1 mRNA levels are not influenced further by the co-treatment. t-PA gene expression is suppressed by both agents in combination, whereas u-PA and β-actin mRNA levels remain essentially unaffected by any treatment. We focused on the mechanisms underlying the powerful synergistic induction of the PAI-2 gene by TNF/PMA. As shown in Fig. 2, time course analyses reveal that the induction of PAI-2 gene expression by TNF, PMA, and TNF/PMA is transient over a relatively long time frame. In the presence of TNF, PAI-2 mRNA is induced within 8 h, while levels reduce to undetectable signals between 24 and 48 h. PMA treatment markedly increases PAI-2 mRNA levels within 8 h, but this effect is reduced by approximately 50 and 90% after 24 and 48 h, respectively. The synergistic increase in PAI-2 gene expression in response to the TNF/PMA co-treatment is evident at all time points studied. Nonetheless, PAI-2 mRNA levels are clearly lower after 48 h. As measured by nuclear run-on transcription assays, a 16-h treatment with TNF, PMA, and TNF/PMA also selectively induces the rate of PAI-2 gene transcription by a 8.3-, 12-, and 26-fold increase, respectively (Fig. 3). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantitations of PAI-2 protein in cytoplasmic extracts prepared from the same cells used for the run-on assays above show that PAI-2 protein levels are increased 6-, 76-, and 181-fold after a 16-h stimulation with TNF, PMA, and TNF/PMA, respectively (Fig. 3). Indeed, in cells co-treated with TNF/PMA, PAI-2 constitutes 0.27% of total protein cell-associated fraction. Co-stimulation of HT-1080 cells with TNF/PMA clearly induces a synergistic increase in PAI-2 antigen, mRNA, and transcription levels. However, under these conditions, the increase in PAI-2 transcription is far lower than those observed at the level of mRNA and synthesized protein. Treatment with PMA alone also produces a greater relative increase in PAI-2 mRNA and antigen compared with the transcriptional activation. These observations highly suggest that post-transcriptional events are involved in implementing the PAI-2 response to PMA and, more particularly, the full synergistic response to TNF/PMA. We designed experiments to explore the potential post-transcriptional mechanisms engaged in the induction of PAI-2 gene expression by PMA and by TNF/PMA. The 3′-UTR of PAI-2 mRNA contains a number of AU-rich motifs generally considered to play a role in mRNA turnover. We therefore postulated that the discrepancy between the levels of PAI-2 transcription and the levels of both antigen and mRNA was a consequence of PAI-2 mRNA stabilization. To determine the potential destabilizing properties of the 3′-UTR of PAI-2 mRNA, we inserted this entire region into the 3′-UTR of the rabbit β-globin reporter gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and stably introduced the resulting construct (pCMVglo-PAI-2), as well as the wild-type β-globin plasmid (pCMVglo), into HT-1080 cells. Since the 3′-UTR of the pig u-PA is known to destabilize β-globin mRNA in transfected porcine LL-CPK cells, we used a pCMVglo-u-PA vector as a destabilization control. The stability of each β-globin hybrid mRNA was tested by DRB-chase experiments. 20 μg/ml of the transcription inhibitor, DRB, were added to the confluent transfected cells for 3, 6, or 9 h, and the chimeric β-globin mRNA expression was assessed by Northern blotting using a specific β-globin probe. As expected for this control, a high level of constitutive and stable β-globin mRNA is detected in cells transfected with the wild-type vector (Fig. 4, lanes 1-5), whereas the insertion of u-PA 3′-UTR into the 3′-UTR of the reporter gene rapidly destabilizes constitutive chimeric β-globin-u-PA mRNA, as previously reported by Nanbu et al. (23Nanbu R. Menoud P.-A. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4920-4928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (lanes 11-15). On the other hand, introduction of the 3′-UTR of PAI-2 into the 3′-UTR of β-globin reduces constitutive chimeric β-globin-PAI-2 mRNA expression by approximately 80%, as determined by phosphor-imaging analysis, but these levels are not influenced by DRB (lanes 6-10). The lack of effect of DRB suggests that the protein(s) that would otherwise promote mRNA decay may be dependent upon ongoing gene transcription. A similar response was observed when transcription was blocked by actinomycin D (data not shown). Run-on transcription assays using nuclei isolated from the stably transfected HT-1080 cells show that the relative transcription rates of pCMVglo, pCMVglo-PAI-2, and pCMVglo-u-PA are similar (Fig. 5), confirming that the changes observed at the mRNA levels are not a reflection of modifications in the transcriptional activities. To determine the broad region within the 580-bp PAI-2 3′-UTR harboring the destabilizing properties, we amplified fragments F1 and F2 by PCR, introduced them in both orientations into the XhoI site of pCMVglo (Fig. 6) and stably transfected the resulting chimeric β-globin-PAI-2 constructs into HT-1080 cells. Northern blot analyses first confirmed that the transfected cells expressed the chimeric β-globin mRNA species of the expected sizes (data not shown). Fragment F1, in either orientation, has no influence on the constitutive and stable expression levels of β-globin mRNA when compared with pCMVglo alone (Fig. 7). In contrast, fragment F2 reduces constitutive β-globin mRNA expression regardless of the orientation to a degree similar to that produced by the full-length PAI-2 3′-UTR. As observed for the full-length 3′-UTR, DRB treatment does not modify these mRNA expression levels. The 3′-fragment of the 3′-UTR of PAI-2 (fragment F2) reduces β-globin mRNA expression. This region harbors the AU-rich nonameric sequence (UUAUUUAUU), an element associated with the decay of other mRNAs (Lagnado et al., 16Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar; Zubiaga et al., 37Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). To determine whether this nonameric element is involved in the destabilization of β-globin by the full-length PAI-2 3′-UTR, we introduced a 4-bp substitution into its core sequence using pCMVglo-PAI-2 as a template. The expression of the resulting construct (pCMVglo-PAI-2mut) was analyzed in stably transfected HT-1080 cells. As shown on Fig. 8, the disruption of the nonameric sequence abrogates the destabilizing ability of the PAI-2 3′-UTR, restoring the expression level to approximately 90% of the wild-type β-globin mRNA. The increased levels of this chimeric transcript are not influenced by treatment with DRB. Nuclear run-on assays indicate that the relative transcription rates of cells expressing pCMVglo-PAI-2 and pCMVglo-PAI-2mut are similar (data not shown). As the synergistic effect of TNF/PMA on endogenous PAI-2 is associated with an increase in mRNA stability, in addition to an increase in gene transcription, we expected that a TNF/PMA co-treatment of cells expressing pCMVglo-PAI-2 would result in an increase in β-globin expression, by an inducible stabilization process conferred via the PAI-2 3′-UTR. To this end, HT-1080 cells stably expressing pCMVglo and pCMVglo-PAI-2 were treated for 16 h in the presence of TNF and PMA. Northern blotting and phosphor-imaging results show that PMA alone or TNF/PMA treatments produce a 3-4-fold increase in the β-globin-PAI-2 chimeric mRNA expression levels (Fig. 9), whereas the wild-type β-globin expression levels remain constant (data not shown). Treatment with TNF alone does not influence chimeric mRNA expression. The inherent destabilizing activity conferred to β-globin is therefore subject to regulation by these agents. Our earlier experiments had demonstrated that PAI-2 mRNA induction by TNF/PMA was transient, over a relatively long time frame, suggesting that the PAI-2 transcript was relatively stable once induced. To address this possibility, we added TNF and PMA, alone and in combination, to wild-type HT-1080 cells for 16 h and then replaced the culture medium with normal medium and subjected the cells to 5 μg/ml actinomycin D for 3, 6, or 9 h. When compared with the PAI-2 mRNA levels in cells not exposed to actinomycin D, PAI-2 mRNA expression remained essentially unchanged even after 24 h treatment with the transcription inhibitor, revealing that PAI-2 mRNA, once induced in the cells, is extremely stable (Fig. 10). In this study, we demonstrate that the regulation of the PAI-2 gene in HT-1080 cells by TNF and PMA is strikingly different from the response of genes encoding other proteins of the plasminogen activator family. We show that PAI-2 gene expression is profoundly and synergistically increased when cells are co-treated with TNF and PMA, whereas the PAI-1 gene, although induced by TNF and PMA alone, does not respond further when cells are co-treated. Time course experiments indicate that TNF and PMA, either added alone or in combination, transiently induce PAI-2 gene expression over an extended period, with elevated mRNA levels evident within 8 h, present maximally between 8 and 24 h, and declining back to near basal expression between 24 and 48 h. PAI-2 mRNA induction is also reflected at the protein level. However, PAI-2 gene transcription rates are not increased to the same extent. These observations raised the possibility that induction of PAI-2 expression by TNF/PMA also required post-transcriptional mRNA-stabilizing events. Many labile transcription factor and cytokine mRNAs harbor multiple copies of regulatory AU-rich motifs in their 3′-UTR. Such AU-rich elements were described over a decade ago as having an important function in the control of mammalian mRNA turnover, and different reports show that relocation of sequences harboring these motifs promotes mRNA destabilization (Shaw and Kamen (31Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar); see Ross (26Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 27Ross J. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) for reviews). As an early step in the process of mRNA decay, these motifs also direct an increase in deadenylation (Shyu et al., 32Shyu A.B. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar; Wilson and Treisman, 36Wilson T. Treisman R. Nature. 1988; 336: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that the pentameric AUUUA motif was the minimum sequence required to confer mRNA decay. However, mutagenesis of this element in the c-fos 3′-UTR does not significantly alter the mRNA decay rate, and other examples show that the presence of AUUUA-like sequences in labile mRNAs does not guarantee a destabilizing function (see Chen and Shyu (4Chen C.Y.A. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar) for a recent review). Recent studies identified the nonameric UUAUUUAUU motif as a minimum AU-rich sequence required to confer mRNA decay (Lagnado et al., 16Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar; Zubiaga et al., 37Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Deletion of a uridine residue from either end weakened the destabilizing effect of the resulting sequence, whereas removal of one residue from both ends abolished its destabilizing properties. This nonameric AU-rich element was also shown to be a critical mediator of the rapid deadenylation and decay of labile mRNAs (Zubiaga et al., 37Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR of PAI-2 mRNA possesses three pentameric AUUUA motifs and one nonameric UUAUUUAUU sequence (see Fig. 6). Using the rabbit β-globin as a reporter mRNA in a stable cell expression system, we show that the 3′-UTR of PAI-2 confers a destabilized phenotype to the hybrid β-globin mRNA. In fact, the entire 580-bp 3′-UTR of PAI-2 is able to reduce the constitutive β-globin mRNA expression level by more than 80%, suggesting that endogenous PAI-2 mRNA is likely to be inherently unstable. This observation may account, at least in part, for the characteristically low, often undetectable levels of PAI-2 mRNA in resting cells. In order to identify the regions responsible for its destabilizing properties, the PAI-2 3′-UTR was divided into two partially overlapping fragments, F1 and F2, which were analyzed for their effect on β-globin mRNA expression. Fragment F1 spans the first 229 residues of the 3′-UTR. Although containing two pentameric AUUUA motifs, F1 is not able to confer destabilization to the reporter mRNA. Fragment F2 contains the 368 nucleotides preceding the PAI-2 poly(A) tail. This region, harboring two pentameric AUUUA motifs (including the most 3′ pentameric motif in fragment F1) as well as the nonameric UUAUUUAUU element, confers β-globin messenger destabilization to a degree comparable with that observed with the full-length 3′-UTR and in an orientation-independent manner. It appears likely that the sequences within fragment F2 are both necessary and sufficient to promote mRNA destabilization. Since we could not completely exclude the possibility that regulatory motifs within fragment F2 were influenced by cryptic sequences located in fragment F1, we used the entire 580-bp PAI-2 3′-UTR as a template for mutagenesis. Given the recent demonstration of the importance of the nonameric UUAUUUAUU motif in mammalian mRNA decay, we chose to disrupt this site in PAI-2 by introducing a 4-base pair substitution into its core element (underlined), creating the sequence UUAAAGCUU. Our results show that this mutation causes a 4-fold increase in the level of the chimeric β-globin-PAI-2 transcript, thereby restoring expression levels close to those of the wild-type β-globin mRNA. These results clearly indicate that the nonameric motif is the major destabilizing region within the PAI-2 3′-UTR. The mechanism by which this motif destabilizes mRNA is unknown but could presumably involve the binding of nuclear or cytoplasmic protein(s) to this site. Since mRNA decay is often associated with deadenylation (see Ross (26Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 27Ross J. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), Beelman and Parker (2Beelman C.A. Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), and Chen and Shyu (4Chen C.Y.A. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar) for reviews), requiring the disengagement of the poly(A)-binding protein, the binding activity of the poly(A)-binding protein may be influenced by the nonameric binding factor(s). In this context, it is also interesting to note that the PAI-2 poly(A) addition signal and its flanking sequences are complementary to the nonameric motif (e.g. AAUAAAUAA). As suggested by preliminary secondary structure analyses of the PAI-2 3′-UTR region using the “squiggles” and “fold” programs of Genetics Computer Group (data not shown; Devereux et al. (9Devereux J.R. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar)), it is possible that the nonameric motif and the poly(A) addition signal may indeed associate. Under constitutive conditions, this structure could prevent or reduce the effectiveness of polyadenylation and may also influence the transport and/or the stability of the transcript. Unstable mRNAs are often studied in vitro by inhibiting transcription with the specific inhibitors actinomycin D or DRB. Although the 3′-UTR of PAI-2 mRNA destabilizes β-globin expression under constitutive conditions without affecting the transcription rate, blocking of transcription did not result in any further alteration of β-globin steady state mRNA levels. This effect is in contrast to the properties harbored by the 3′-UTR of u-PA, which profoundly destabilized constitutive β-globin mRNA and also accelerated mRNA decay during transcriptional blockade. In our studies, the lack of accelerated decay in the presence of DRB is not a reflection of the β-globin reporter system, since endogenous PAI-2 mRNA levels, once induced by 16-h treatment with TNF, PMA, or TNF/PMA, also remain stable after removal of the inducing agents and transcription blockade. Our earlier data indicated that induction of PAI-2 mRNA by these agents was transient but followed a relatively long time course (up to 48 h). Many labile mRNAs are also induced in a transient manner, but for most of them, their induction and decline occur in less than 1 h. The long term transient induction of PAI-2 mRNA may be explained, at least in part, by the stable nature of the transcript once induced. The mechanisms responsible for the decline of PAI-2 mRNA after 24 h remain to be determined, but this may be a reflection of a transient transcriptional response, since induction of PAI-2 transcription rates in U-937 cells treated with PMA is transient (Schleuning et al., 30Schleuning W.D. Medcalf R.L. Hession C. Rothenbuhler R. Shaw A. Kruithof E.K.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 53: 4564-4567Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is also possible that protein factors that presumably associate with the 3′-UTR of PAI-2 and induce mRNA degradation are themselves dependent on transcription. If true, this would preclude the use of global transcription inhibitors in such analyses. We are presently attempting to study intrinsic mRNA decay in the absence of exogenous inhibitors by using the transiently expressed and serum-inducible c-fos promoter (Lagnado et al., 16Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We designed a series of experiments to determine if TNF and PMA treatment of cells would stabilize the 3′-UTR of PAI-2. We hypothesized that the net synergistic increase in PAI-2 mRNA in cells treated with TNF/PMA was a consequence of both transcription activation and stabilization of the PAI-2 mRNA. Such a response would be analogous to the mechanism described by Chen et al. (5Chen F.Y. Amara F.M. Wright J.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) in which the half-life of the ribonucleotide reductase R1 mRNA is reported to increase in 3T3 cells treated with PMA. That report also shows that a specific protein binding activity on the 3′-UTR is reduced in cells exposed to PMA. In our study, we were able to demonstrate a 3-4-fold increase in the accumulation of the chimeric β-globin-PAI-2 transcript after TNF/PMA co-treatment. Although this effect would contribute to the abundance of PAI-2 mRNA produced in response to these mediators, it remains to be determined if this can fully account for the level of endogenous PAI-2 mRNA induction seen under these conditions. Since endogenous PAI-2 mRNA levels are increased at least 200-fold by TNF/PMA, whereas the PAI-2 gene transcription rate is only increased 26-fold, it is possible that other regulatory sites are required to implement the net stabilizing effect caused by these agents. Treatment of HT-1080 cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, produces a marked increase in PAI-2 mRNA (Medcalf et al., 20Medcalf R.L. Van den Berg E. Schleuning W.D. J. Cell. Biol. 1988; 108: 971-978Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar) but not in the rate of PAI-2 gene transcription. 2F. Maurer and R. Medcalf, unpublished observations. These observations suggest that PAI-2 mRNA is modulated by labile protein(s), which, under constitutive conditions, promote PAI-2 mRNA decay. Furthermore, down-regulation of PAI-2 mRNA by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone has been reported to be mediated by destabilization of PAI-2 mRNA. Whether labile cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins that interact with the nonameric AU-rich sequence motif identified in this study are influenced by dexamethasone treatment is unknown. It also remains to be determined whether the stabilizing effect of PMA and TNF/PMA on PAI-2 mRNA is mediated by altering the activity or abundance of nonameric AU-rich binding protein(s). The demonstration of a destabilizing motif within the PAI-2 3′-UTR underscores the complex regulatory nature of PAI-2 gene expression. The human PAI-2 gene is an end point for a number of important intracellular signal transduction pathways. For the most part, much of the induction of PAI-2 expression can be attributed to changes in the transcription rate. Here, we also demonstrate that the 3′-UTR of PAI-2 mRNA plays a significant role in PAI-2 expression. Future studies need to be directed to elucidate the mechanisms by which the nonameric AU-rich motif promotes PAI-2 mRNA decay and the mechanisms by which TNF/PMA promotes stabilization. These studies may provide novel insights to influence the expression of the PAI-2 gene in vivo, which may have advantages in the context of tumor metastasis and cellular differentiation."

Transcription of the PDGF A-chain gene can be stimulated or inhibited by a variety of growth factors and cytokines (reviewed in 11). The transcriptional mechanisms mediating these effects and cell-specific patterns of A-chain expression are not fully understood, although accumulating evidence indicates that the transcriptional regulation of the A-chain gene is governed by a complex interaction of positive and negative regulatory elements. A highly GC-rich region in the proximal 5′-flanking sequence of the human A-chain promoter (−80 to −50) has been shown to contribute over 80% promoter activity (12Kaetzel D.M. Maul R.S. Liu B.

In this study, we have employed deletion mutagenesis, S1 nuclease hypersensitivity assay, and transient transfection to identify a 31-bp silencer element in the distal 5′ flanking region (−1418 to −1388; 5′SHS) that represses transcription of the A-chain promoter in a variety of cell lines. Mutational analysis of the 5′SHS element suggests that a centrally located GGGGAGGGGG motif, found in both 5′SHS and int-SHS elements, is required both for binding of antisense strand-specific proteins and for full silencer function. Furthermore, we have determined that 5′SHS and int-SHS bind to the same antisense strand-specific binding proteins (p97, p87 and p17), strongly suggesting a common mechanism of transcriptional silencing by these topologically distant DNA elements. These results highlight the role of transcriptional repression in the regulation of A-chain gene expression and indicate the importance of single strand DNA-specific binding proteins in eukaryotic gene transcription. Construction of the plasmids pAC261 and pUTKAT3 has been described (12Kaetzel D.M. Maul R.S. Liu B. Bonthron D. Fenstermarker R.A. Coyne D.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Prost E. Moore D.D. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The plasmid pGL261 was constructed by inserting an XhoI-HindIII fragment of the PDGF A-chain promoter fragment (−261 to +8) into pGL2-basic (Promega), a promoterless plasmid containing the luciferase reporter gene. To localize DNA elements in the upstream negative regulatory region involved in repression of PDGF A-chain transcription, the −1853 to −883 region was digested with restriction endonucleases AccI and BssHII into four fragments, designated A (−1853 to −1716), B (−1680 to −1374), C (−1373 to −1032), and D (−1031 to −883). The four fragments were inserted in both orientations into the XbaI site of pUTKAT3 and the NheI site of pGL261. DNA sequence in the −1853 to −883 region of the PDGF A-chain promoter was obtained by double-stranded DNA sequencing of plasmids containing fragments A-D by the Sequenase procedure (Amersham Corp.). Wild type and mutated 5′SHS oligodeoxynucleotides and their complementary strands were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies), annealed, and inserted in both orientations 5′ to the cat gene into the XbaI site of pAC261. The wild type 5′SHS was also inserted in both orientations 3′ to the cat gene into the BamHI site of pAC261, and 5′ to the cat sequence at the XbaI site of pUTKAT3. BSC-1, A172 (human glioblastoma), U87 (human astrocytoma), and HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. HeLa S3 (human cervical carcinoma) cells were kindly provided by Dr. Anuradha Ray (Rockefeller University). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 10 mM nonessential amino acids, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All plasmids used in transient transfection were purified by an ion-exchange chromatographic procedure (Qiagen). BSC-1 and HepG2 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation as described previously (12Kaetzel D.M. Maul R.S. Liu B. Bonthron D. Fenstermarker R.A. Coyne D.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6445) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and were lysed for cat assays by three freeze-thaw cycles in 100 μl of 0.25 mM Tris, pH 7.8, per dish. For luciferase assays, cells were lysed in 200 μl of 1 × reporter lysis buffer (25 mM Bicine, pH 7.6, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.05% Tween 80). U87 and HeLa cells were transfected with Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (18Shamah S.M. Stiles C.D. Guha A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7203-7212Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). U87 cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection on fibronectin-coated (1 μg/cm2 for 1 h, Sigma) 60-mm diameter tissue culture dishes at a density of 4 × 105 cells per dish. HeLa cells were plated at a density of 1.4 × 106 cells per 60-mm dish 24 h prior to transfection. Lipofectin was added to DMEM at a concentration of 16 μl/ml, mixed with an equal volume of DMEM containing 1.5 μg of pRSV-βgal, and 3.5 μg of test plasmid, and the DNA-Lipofectin mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were rinsed twice with 1 × PBS and incubated with the Lipofectin-DNA mixture (1.6 ml per dish) at 37°C for 5 h. An equal volume of DMEM containing 10% FBS was then added to the dishes, and the cells were harvested 60 h after transfection. Assays of cat and β-gal activity were performed on cell lysates as described (12Kaetzel D.M. Maul R.S. Liu B. Bonthron D. Fenstermarker R.A. Coyne D.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5280) Google Scholar, 20Herbomel P.

Relative cat activity represents the percent conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol to acetylated products after correction for transfection efficiency by β-gal activity. Luciferase assays were conducted as described by the manufacturer (Promega). Twenty-μl aliquots were assayed by injection of 100 μl of reconstituted luciferase assay reagent (20 mM Tricine, 1.07 mM (MgCO3)4 Mg(OH)2·5H2O, 2.67 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM EDTA, 33.3 mM DTT, 270 μM coenzyme A, 470 μM Luciferin, 530 μM ATP, final pH 7.8) and measurement of light output for 15 s with a LB9501 Lumet luminometer (Wallac). S1 nuclease hypersensitivity (SHS) assays were performed as described (21Wang Z. Lin X-H. Qiu Q-Q. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17022-17031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To localize regions of the upstream PDGF A-chain promoter that were hypersensitive to S1 nuclease, mapping of SHS sites was performed with 1 μg of supercoiled pGL261+B plasmid DNA in 50 μl of S1 buffer (30 mM NaOAc, pH 4.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, and 3 mM Zn(OAc)2) with increasing amounts of S1 nuclease (0.1, 0.5, 1 or 5 units) at 37°C for 10 min. S1 nuclease-nicked DNA was end-labeled on the antisense strand by linearization with MluI and incubation with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [α32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN). Radiolabeled DNA was digested with XhoI and the 300-bp product isolated by electrophoresis. The sense strand was radiolabeled in similar fashion, except that S1 nuclease-nicked DNA was treated with XhoI prior to end labeling, followed by digestion with MluI. SHS sites were visualized by electrophoresis on a 6% denaturing gel followed by autoradiography. Sites of cleavage were determined relative to a sequencing ladder obtained by DNA sequencing of pGL261+B by the Sequenase procedure. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HepG2, U87, HeLa, BSC-1, and A172 cells by the method of Dignam et al. (22Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9106) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were conducted as described (23Bokar J.A. Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Kaetzel D.M. Hanson R.W. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19740-19747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 36-bp irrelevant DNA sequence (5′-GGGCCGGCGGACTCGCACGGTGGGTTTTAACCTTTT-3′) was used as a nonspecific competitor. Competitive EMSAs with wild type and mutated 5′SHS were scanned with an M2 densitometer (Imaging Research Inc.) to quantify radioactivity in protein-DNA and free probe bands. Southwestern blotting was performed as described (24Farrell F.X. Sax C.M. Zehner Z.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2349-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Crude nuclear extract (50 μg) was mixed with Dignam buffer D and 6 μl of 4 × sample loading buffer (8% SDS, 28% glycerol, 0.32 M Tris, pH 6.8, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 10 mM DTT) to a final volume of 24 μl, heated at 95°C for 5 min, and then loaded onto a denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel (3% stacking, 10 or 15% separating) in a buffer of 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS. After electrophoresis, gels were incubated for 30 min in gel transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol) and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes with a Bio-Rad transfer cell at 20 V for 1 h. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TNED (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) containing 5% Carnation nonfat dry milk, washed in TNED for 5 min, and placed in a sealed plastic bag containing 5 ml TNED, 5 × 105 cpm/ml oligodeoxynucleotide probe, with or without unlabeled competitor DNA. Membranes were incubated with the probe mixture for 1 h at room temperature, washed twice with TNED for 10 min, and air-dried. Bands were visualized by autoradiography. We previously employed 5′-end point deletion analysis to identify two regions in the 5′-flanking sequence of the A-chain promoter that exhibited negative regulatory activity, designated NRE1 (−1853 to −1032) and NRE2 (−1031 to −883) (12Kaetzel D.M. Maul R.S. Liu B. Bonthron D. Fenstermarker R.A. Coyne D.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of the −1853 to −883 region was obtained (Fig. 1), and the region was digested into four fragments, A, B, C, and D, with restriction endonucleases AccI and BssHII (Fig. 2A). These fragments were subcloned into pGL261, which contains the −261 to +8 segment of the PDGF A-chain promoter and the luciferase reporter gene. BSC-1 cells, which exhibit considerable A-chain expression when maintained in basal serum-containing culture medium conditions (12Kaetzel D.M. Maul R.S. Liu B. Bonthron D. Fenstermarker R.A. Coyne D.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), were transiently transfected with these constructs. Fragment A had no effect on luciferase activity when oriented correctly with respect to the A-chain promoter (sense) but modestly inhibited transcription in the opposite orientation (Fig. 2B). Fragment B displayed the most inhibitory activity of the four fragments, reducing luciferase activity to 35% of pGL261 when oriented correctly, although it failed to inhibit transcription in the opposite orientation. Fragment C did not affect transcriptional activity, whereas fragment D displayed a 50% inhibition in either orientation.Fig. 2Localization of negative regulatory activity in the 5′ A-chain promoter by transient transfection of BSC-1 cells. A, relative positions of fragments A, B, C, and D in the A-chain promoter, with the transcriptional start site (+1) noted with an arrow. Shown are the results of transient transfection with plasmids containing fragments A-D, inserted 5′ of the A-chain promoter (pGL261, B) or the heterologous HSV-tk promoter (pTK, C). The activities of the four fragments in both sense (black) and antisense (shaded) orientations are corrected for co-transfected β-gal activity and expressed as a relative percent of the activities of pGL261 or pTK alone, which are set respectively to 100%. The results represent the mean of four independent transfections (± S.E.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test the ability of fragments A-D to repress transcription of a heterologous promoter, they were inserted into the plasmid pUTKAT3 that contains a promoter/enhancer segment of the thymidine kinase gene from herpes simplex virus (HSV-tk) and the cat reporter gene (16Prost E. Moore D.D. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Fragment A modestly inhibited tk promoter activity in both orientations (Fig. 2C). Fragments B and C were much more active than fragment A in their sense orientations, decreasing cat activity to 20 and 35% of the pUTKAT3 parent vector, respectively. In their negative orientations, fragments B and C also inhibited the tk promoter, albeit to a lesser extent, decreasing cat activity to 55 and 75% of the parent construct. Fragment D also significantly inhibited tk promoter activity but only in the opposite orientation. These results indicate the presence of multiple subregions in the −1853 to −883 fragment of the PDGF A-chain gene that repress transcription. Fragment B exerted the strongest inhibitory activity upon both promoters, and its ability to inhibit transcription in a distance-independent manner suggested that it could be liberally characterized as a classical silencer element. Hypersensitivity to S1 nuclease has proven useful in mapping cis-acting DNA transcriptional elements, since single-stranded, non-B form DNA structures often serve as recognition sites for binding of trans-acting factors. When a supercoiled plasmid containing the upstream negative regulatory region of the A-chain promoter (−1836 to −814) was treated with S1 nuclease and then digested with BamHI, a single, predominant S1 nuclease-hypersensitive (SHS) site was revealed within the fragment B region, at approximately −1400 (data not shown). To localize this SHS site, high resolution mapping was performed as described under “Materials and Methods” with the plasmid pGL261+B, which contains the fragment B region (see Fig. 2B). S1 nuclease hypersensitivity was observed on both DNA strands over an 18-bp region (−1416 to −1399), consistent with the location identified by crude mapping. The antisense strand was particularly accessible to S1 nuclease, with two adjacent nucleotides A and C displaying the most sensitivity and two nearby nucleotides T and C showing a lesser degree (Fig. 3, left). Cleavage induced at the site was directly correlated with increasing concentrations of S1 nuclease, while none was observed in the absence of enzyme (Fig. 3, lane 1). Two G residues on the sense strand were S1 nuclease-hypersensitive, with two nucleotides A and C exhibiting lesser sensitivity (Fig. 3, right). The DNA sequence in this region bore considerable homology to an SHS silencer element previously identified in the first intron of the A-chain gene, including an identical GGGGAGGGGG motif (Fig. 4A; 15Wang Z. Masaharu N. Qiu Q. Takimoto Y. Deuel T.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Hereafter, the upstream SHS region will be designated 5′SHS and intron silencer element as int-SHS.Fig. 4The 5′SHS sequence functions as a silencer element in multiple cell lines. A, DNA sequence homology between SHS sites in the first intron (+1605 to +1630, int-SHS) and 5′ promoter region (−1418 to −1388, 5′SHS) of the PDGF A-chain gene. Lowercase letters indicate overhanging ends of restriction enzyme sites. B, transient transfection of BSC-1 cells with plasmids containing 5′SHS inserted in both orientations in either the A-chain promoter (pAC261, black) or tk promoter (pTK, shaded). C, transient transfection with plasmids containing 5′SHS inserted in both orientations upstream of the A-chain promoter (pAC261) in HepG2 (unshaded), U87 (shaded), and HeLa (black) cells. Relative cat activity is expressed as a percent of the activity of the parent vectors pAC261 or pTK. The results are the average of three independent experiments, with error bars representing the S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the 5′SHS region harbored transcriptional silencer activity, a double-stranded 31-bp oligodeoxynucleotide encompassing the 5′SHS (−1418 to −1388) was synthesized and inserted either 5′- or 3′- to the A-chain promoter in pAC261 and 5′- to the tk promoter in pUTKAT3. Transient transfection of BSC-1 cells with these plasmids revealed a significant ability of the 5′SHS sequence to repress the A-chain promoter, reducing cat activity to approximately 40% of control in both orientations when placed upstream of the promoter. The 5′SHS also repressed promoter activity in the correct orientation downstream of promoter and cat sequences but significantly enhanced transcription (1.8-fold) in the opposite orientation. The 5′SHS inhibited transcription from the heterologous tk promoter in both orientations, decreasing cat activity to less than 40% in the opposite orientation and to a lesser extent when oriented correctly (85%, Fig. 4B). The 5′SHS can thus be defined as a classical silencer element based on its ability to repress homologous and heterologous promoters, to function in a distance-independent manner, and to inhibit transcription in both orientations with respect to the A-chain promoter. To assess 5′SHS silencer activity across a panel of cell lines that express varying amounts of A-chain, HeLa (low expression), HepG2 (intermediate), and U87 (high) cells were transiently transfected with plasmid constructs 5′SHS+/pAC261 and 5′SHS−/pAC261. As previously observed in BSC-1 cells, the 5′SHS element reduced cat activity to 40-50% of control in all three cell lines and both orientations (Fig. 4C). The ability to repress transcription in multiple, unrelated cell lines indicates a ubiquitous role of 5′SHS as a silencer. To identify nuclear factors that bind to 5′SHS, EMSAs were performed with BSC-1 cell nuclear extract and oligodeoxynucleotide probes derived from the 5′SHS. To address whether 5′SHS and int-SHS bind to the same proteins, an oligodeoxynucleotide containing the int-SHS sequence was also included. Double-stranded 5′SHS probe (ds-5′SHS) formed two distinct DNA-protein complexes in the absence of unlabeled competitor (Fig. 5A, lane 1). The intensities of these two bands were both reduced by more than 80% in the presence of unlabeled ds-5′SHS competitor at a 10-fold molar excess (lane 2), with complete displacement at a 100-fold molar excess (lane 3). Unlabeled, double-stranded int-SHS oligodeoxynucleotide (ds-int-SHS) also competed at a 100-fold molar excess with ds-5′SHS probe for binding to the two proteins but was not as efficient as unlabeled ds-5′SHS at a 10-fold molar excess (lanes 4 and 5). Single-stranded (sense or antisense) forms of 5′SHS and int-SHS did not compete with ds-5′SHS probe for protein binding (lanes 6-9), suggesting high affinity binding requires contacts furnished by both DNA strands. An irrelevant 36-mer oligodeoxynucleotide in single-stranded form did not compete with ds-5′SHS probe for binding to these two complexes (lane 10). The double-stranded form of the irrelevant oligodeoxynucleotide competed inefficiently at a 100-fold molar excess for binding to complex 1 (lane 11), at a level less than that seen with a 10-fold excess of homologous ds-5′SHS competitor. The irrelevant oligodeoxynucleotide competed somewhat more efficiently for binding to complex 2, suggesting this binding interaction was less sequence-specific. The S1 nuclease hypersensitivity of 5′SHS suggested that proteins with specificity for single-stranded structures might bind to this region. Thus, EMSAs were conducted with single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide probes derived from both strands of the 5′SHS. Antisense 5′SHS probe (as-5′SHS) formed two distinct DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 5B, lane 1) with significantly greater mobility than those formed with ds-5′SHS probe. Efficient dose-dependent competition of binding was observed with unlabeled homologous competitor (lanes 2 and 3), indicating a high affinity interaction between these two protein complexes and as-5′SHS. Unlabeled ds-5′SHS competed to a lesser extent (lanes 4 and 5), indicating the affinity of these complexes was higher for the antisense strand form. The as-int-SHS sequence competed effectively with as-5′SHS probe for protein binding (lanes 6 and 7), strongly suggesting that the antisense strands of both 5′SHS and int-SHS are recognized as high affinity binding sites for the same nuclear proteins. Double-stranded int-SHS competed less efficiently for binding of these proteins to the as-5′SHS probe at a 100-fold molar excess (lanes 8 and 9). Neither the sense strand of int-SHS (lane 10) nor nonspecific competitor (lanes 11 and 12) significantly displaced protein binding to the antisense 5′SHS probe, indicating the sequence specificity of these complexes. EMSAs conducted with 5′SHS sense probe (s-5′SHS) revealed the formation of numerous DNA-protein complexes, only one of which was specifically displaced by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled s-5′SHS competitor (Fig. 5C, lanes 1-3). The ability of unlabeled int-SHS oligodeoxynucleotides to compete with radiolabeled 5′SHS probes for protein binding suggested that the 5′SHS and int-SHS sequences bind the same set of proteins. This conclusion was reinforced by EMSAs conducted with radiolabeled as-int-SHS probes, in which a doublet of bands identical in mobility to that formed with as-5′SHS probes was observed (data not shown). Taken together, the EMSA analyses suggest that the antisense strands of 5′SHS and int-SHS are recognized as high affinity binding sites for the same set of nuclear proteins, whereas sense and double-stranded forms of 5′SHS are recognized by their own cognate DNA-binding proteins. To identify individual nucleotides within the 5′SHS sequence required for protein binding, the ability of a panel of mutant 5′SHS oligodeoxynucleotides to compete for binding to radioactive 5′SHS probes was evaluated (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W2008165719,"A circularly permuted self-splicing group I intron from Anabaena was used to generate covalently closed circular trans-acting ribozymes in Escherichia coli. The RNA component of Bacillus subtilis RNaseP and an artificial trans-acting hepatitis delta virus ribozyme were expressed as the exon portion of the permuted intron. RNA isolated from these cells contained circular forms of the ribozymes, indicating that circles were generated from precursors expressed in these cells. Total RNA isolated from cells producing the circular RNA contained ribozyme activity. In contrast, a linear form of the delta virus ribozyme expressed as part of an unprocessed transcript yielded no detectable activity. These data extend previous in vitro and in vivo studies on splicing-mediated RNA circularization by demonstrating the intracellular production of circular ribozymes. These results have implications for the development of systems expressing therapeutic forms of small RNAs such as ribozymes and decoy-type competitors. Circular RNAs generated by splicing are devoid of flanking sequences that could potentially interfere with function. Also, because circular RNAs are not primary substrates for exonucleases, they may have increased in vivo half-lives relative to linear molecules with similar sequences."

C. (1994) FEBS Lett. 352, 109-112). To identify which PKC isoform is responsible for this effect, aspartate transport through system X−AG, PKC activity, and the subcellular distribution of PKC isoforms have been studied before and after treatment with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) in fibroblasts maintained at low serum for 1 (control cells) or 7 days (quiescent cells). In control cells aspartate transport and PKC activity in the particulate fraction were stimulated by short term PDBu treatment; both stimulatory effects were down-regulated by a prolonged exposure to the phorbol. In contrast, in quiescent cells aspartate transport and particulate PKC activity were higher than control under basal conditions, unaffected by a short term PDBu treatment, and lowered by a prolonged incubation with the phorbol. In both control and quiescent cells a short term PDBu treatment modified PKCα distribution, increasing its membrane-associated fraction. PKCδ was mostly in the soluble fraction and scarcely sensitive to PDBu. A brief exposure to PDBu increased membrane-associated PKCϵ in control but not in quiescent cells. In these cells ϵ isoform was found exclusively in the particulate fraction even in PDBu-untreated cells. A prolonged PDBu treatment caused a partial down-regulation of membrane-associated PKCϵ in control cells and its marked decrease in quiescent cells. It is concluded that PKC-dependent changes in system X−AG activity parallel the behavior of PKCϵ, thus suggesting a specific role for this isoform in system X−AG regulation."

Antibodies raised to residues 263-282 of the gene product (peptide Pro-20-Ala) block both cell attachment and cell haptotaxis toward laminin (15Wewer U.M. Taraboletti G. Sobel M.E. Albrechtsen R. Liotta L.A. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5691-5698PubMed Google Scholar). 67-LR immunoreactivity has a surface location on whole cells (16Romanov V. Sobel M.E. Dasilva P.P. Menard S. Castronovo V. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1994; 2: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but a large pool of the precursor is also found in the cytoplasm (17Castronovo V. Claysmith A.P. Barker K.T. Cioce V. Krutsch H.C. Sobel M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We found that a linear peptide encompassing residues 33-42 of murine EGF C-loop (mEGF-(33-42); CVIGYSGDRC) blocks the stimulatory effects of laminin in cell motility and chick angiogenesis assays (5Nelson J. Allen W.E. Scott W.N. Bailie J. Walker B. McFerran N.V. Wilson D.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3772-3776PubMed Google Scholar). Although derived from mEGF, mEGF-(33-42) has no demonstrable EGF receptor binding activity (18Bailie J.R. McGivern M. Nelson J. Walker B. Murphy R.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1989; 17: 409-410Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The 67-LR agonist, Lam.B1-(925-933), is partially homologous with the decapeptide C-loop sequence of all transforming growth factors α and EGFs (19Panayotou G. End P. Aumailley M. Timpi R. Engel J.

Lam.B1-(925-934) represents the “C-loop” of one of eight EGF-like repeats found in domain III of both murine and human forms of the laminin B1 chain (21Sasaki M. Kato S. Kohno K. Martin G.R.

Consequently, we have examined the ability of mEGF-(33-42) to interact with 67-LR in both radioreceptor and attachment assays and attempt to explain, in terms of a common predicted structure, the peptides' shared abilities to block both specific laminin binding and laminin-dependent cell attachment. Murine epidermal growth factor (receptor grade) was obtained from Biogenesis (Bournemouth, UK); murine laminin (affinity-purified) was from Sigma (Poole, UK); CDPGYIGSR-amide (Lam.B1-(925-933)) was from Novabiochem (Nottingham, UK); and acetyl-C-(S-Acm)-VIGYSGDR-C-(S-Acm)-amide (mEGF-(33-42)) was synthesized as described previously (18Bailie J.R. McGivern M. Nelson J. Walker B. Murphy R.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1989; 17: 409-410Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Control peptides were as follows: neuromedin B (obtained from Novabiochem) and a decapeptide containing all residues from mEGF-(33-42) in a random sequence, which was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems automated peptide synthesizer (model 431A) using standard solid-phase Fmoc procedures. Peptides were purified after synthesis using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and purity was confirmed by automated amino acid analysis and electrospray mass spectrometry. A biotinylated analog of mEGF-(33-42) was synthesized as above, in which an Nϵ-biotinylated lysine residue was incorporated as its N-α-Fmoc derivative to give acetyl-C-(S-Acm)-VIGYSGDR-C-(S-Acm)-K-(Nϵ-biotin)-amide. In calculations of molarity, the following values for molecular mass (m) were used: laminin, m = 900,000 Da; mEGF-(33-42), m = 1,255 Da; LamB1-(925-933), m = 966 Da; “random”, m = 1,255 Da; neuromedin B, m = 1,133 Da. The peptide (PTEDWSAQPATEDWSAAPTA, peptide Pro-20-Ala), corresponding to a linear sequence from the C-terminal end of the human laminin receptor (15Wewer U.M. Taraboletti G. Sobel M.E. Albrechtsen R. Liotta L.A. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5691-5698PubMed Google Scholar), was used as the antigen template. The peptide was synthesized as a multiple antigen presentation derivative (23Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5409-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar), using standard Fmoc protocols. New Zealand White rabbits were immunized subcutaneously with 500 μg of antigen in adjuvant (Alum Imject, Pierce, Chester, UK), with boosts of 800 μg (at 21-day intervals). Test bleeds were taken 2 days after each boost, and serum was prepared. The IgG fraction of antiserum was purified using immobilized protein G-Sepharose columns (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The titer and specificity of antiserum as well as IgG fractions were confirmed using an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbant assay, as described (15Wewer U.M. Taraboletti G. Sobel M.E. Albrechtsen R. Liotta L.A. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5691-5698PubMed Google Scholar) except that the multiple antigen presentation antigen was dried onto plates. The R1 monoclonal antibody against the human EGF receptor was kindly provided by the Hybridoma Development Unit of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (London, UK). This antibody has previously been shown to specifically block the biological effects of the EGF receptor (24Gullick W.J. Downward D.J.H. Marsden J.J. Waterfield M.D. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). T-47D human breast cancer cells and SK HEP-1 human endothelial cells (25Heffelfinger S.C. Hawkins H.H. Barrish J. Taylor L. Darlington G.J. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1992; 28A: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) were obtained from the European Animal Cell Culture Collection (Porton Down, UK), media, and fetal calf serum were from ICN Biomedicals (High Wycombe, UK). T-47D and SK HEP-1 cells were routinely passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Embryonic chick endothelial cells were isolated from the area vasculosa of the chick embryo, as described earlier (26Allen W.E. Wilson D.J. J. Anat. 1994; 184: 194Google Scholar), and cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (200 units·ml−1), streptomycin (200 μg·ml−1), and fungizone (2.5 μg·ml−1). Bovine retinal capillary endothelial cells (BRCE) were kindly provided by Dr. Usha Chakravarthy (Department of Opthalmology, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, UK) and were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Affinity-purified murine laminin (Sigma) was radioiodinated using 125I-labeled sodium iodide (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) and immobilized chloramine-T (Iodobeads, Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the reaction, excess Na125I and unincorporated 125I2 was separated from the iodinated protein by gel filtration on a GF-5 exclusion column (Pierce). Iodinated laminin fractions were recovered at a specific activity of approximately 1.2 μCi·μg−1 protein (864 Ci·mmol−1). Near confluent cultures of T-47D or SK HEP-1 cells were removed from flasks using 0.02% EGTA in calcium-free phosphate-buffered saline (CFS) and passed through a G-25 syringe needle to produce single-cell suspensions. Aliquots of each cell type (106 cells·ml−1) were dispensed into separate Eppendorf tubes (1 ml each) and pelleted. The cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, either laminin or synthetic peptide (at the concentrations indicated), and iodinated laminin at a final 125I-laminin concentration of 0.1 nM (approximately 50,000 cpm). These mixtures were incubated overnight at 4°C. The tubes were then microcentrifuged at high speed, and the supernatant was removed. After washing the pellet with 500 μl of CFS, the remaining radioactivity was determined using a γ radiation counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by incubating cells with a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled laminin. All estimations were carried out in triplicate. IC50 (concentration of peptide required for 50% inhibition of radioligand binding), EC50 (effective concentration for 50% inhibition of cell attachment), and their S.D. values were calculated using computerized curve fitting (27Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK1992Google Scholar). Non-tissue culture grade 96-well plates (Sterilin Ltd., Middlesex, UK), coated with 2.5 μg of murine laminin (Sigma) in 50 μl of CFS/well, were air-dried overnight at room temperature. Preliminary experiments indicated that cell attachment was concentration-dependent; maximal binding occurred at a laminin coating of 2.5 μg/well (data not shown). After rinsing with CFS (100 μl), the plastic was saturated with casein (0.2% in CFS). Plates were incubated at room temperature for 45 min and then washed extensively with CFS (3 × 100 μl). After removal of culture media, cells were detached from monolayers with EGTA (0.02% in CFS) at 37°C. The cells were then centrifuged at low speed, and the pellet was resuspended in serum-free DMEM. Peptides and soluble laminin (at the concentrations indicated) were incubated with aliquots of 106 cells (37°C for 1 h) in a volume of 1 ml. 100-μl samples of each cell suspension were then added to the precoated multiwell plates and incubated for a further 60 min. Incubation media were removed, and the wells washed with CFS (3 × 100 μl) to remove nonadherent cells. Attached cell numbers were evaluated spectrophotometrically at 620 nm after fixing with 10% formaldehyde and staining with crystal violet (28Kanamuru H. Yoshida O. Urol. Res. 1989; 25: 259-264Google Scholar). All incubations were carried out at least in triplicate. In order to demonstrate cell adhesion to immobilized mEGF-(33-42), a modification of the above laminin attachment assay was used. Solid-phase streptavidin (coated onto 96-well plates) was used to capture the biotinylated derivative of mEGF-(33-42), since it had previously determined that underivatized mEGF-(33-42) bound to the plastic with low affinity (data not shown). Briefly, non-tissue culture grade 96-well plates were coated with 100 μg/well streptavidin (Sigma) in 0.2 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.8). Following an overnight incubation at 37°C, the wells were washed with CFS (3 × 100 μl), and the plastic was blocked with casein (0.2% in CFS). The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 45 min and washed with CFS as previously detailed. Biotinylated mEGF-(33-42) in CFS was then aliquoted into the wells (1.6 μg/well), and the plates were incubated for 3 h at 37°C. After a further block with 0.2% casein, the wells were washed with CFS (3 × 100-μl aliquots). Control cells were prepared as above and preincubated for 1 h at 37°C in peptide-free medium, test cells were preincubated with serial dilutions of either the anti-laminin receptor polyclonal or anti-EGF (R1) receptor monoclonal antibodies, prior to addition to coated wells. Subsequent procedures were as detailed for the laminin attachment assay. Amino acid residues in the synthetic peptides are numbered by their position (P1-P10) when aligned with mEGF-(33-42). 2Synthetic peptides are aligned with mEGF-(33-42), and residue positions are numbered in the text starting from the N-terminal cysteine 33. For example, the positions for mEGF-(33-42) are as follows: Cys (P1), Val (P2), Ile (P3), Gly (P4), Tyr (P5), Ser (P6), Gly (P7), Asp (P8), Arg (P9), Cys (P10). The Sybyl suite of programs (version 6.0, Tripos Associates Inc., St Louis, MO), running on an ESV3+ workstation (Evans and Sutherland Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) was used throughout the modeling. The starting structure was obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (29Bernstein F. Koetzle T.T. Williams G.J.B. Meyer E.F.J. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8135) Google Scholar), (entry 1EPI, mEGF (30Kohda D. Inagaki F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11928-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)). Residues 1-32 and 43-53 of mEGF were deleted, and the N and C termini of the remaining decapeptide structure (CVIGYSGDRC) were capped with acetyl and amide groups, respectively. Acm groups were built on the exposed sulfur atoms to give mEGF-(33-42) in the initial, native conformation S0, a starting point for all the dynamics simulations. This structure was minimized to generate an initial structure for the dynamics run. Partial atomic charges were calculated using the Pullman method (31Berthod H. Giessner-Prettre C. Pullman A. Theoret. Chim. Acta. 1967; 8: 212-222Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and a distance-dependent dielectric of 4 × r was employed, with an 8-Å cutoff for nonbonded interactions. Asp (P8) and Arg (P9) were assigned charges of −1 and +1, respectively. During the simulation, the SHAKE algorithm (32Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.C. J. Comp. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (16339) Google Scholar) was used for nonpolar hydrogen atoms using a 100-fs interval with a dynamics calculation interval of 1 fs. The temperature was raised from 0 K to 350 K in seven equal steps of 200 fs, with coupling to the temperature bath every 10 fs. The simulation was continued for a further 40 ps, with coordinates, temperatures, and potential energies being recorded at 200-fs intervals. During this simulation, both the “local temperatures” of the backbone and side chain atoms and also the root mean square deviation of the C-α atoms from the starting mEGF-like conformation were monitored. A conformer from late in the simulation was chosen as being representative and was refined by minimization to give the final mEGF-(33-42) fold. For the laminin B1 nonapeptide, the mEGF-(33-42) structure (S0) was used as a starting point. The C-terminal cysteine-(S-Acm)-amide residue at P10 was removed, and the exposed arginyl residue (P9) was capped with an amide. Since this laminin nonapeptide, unlike mEGF-(33-42), was not N-terminally acetylated, the N-terminal acetyl capping group was replaced with an ammonium group. The rest of the residues were then “mutated” to reflect the required laminin sequence on a residue-by-residue basis with the proline geometry being adjusted by the software. This structure was minimized without charges, as for mEGF-(33-42), and was subjected to a dynamics simulation, extended to 51.4 ps, with identical conditions to the mEGF-(33-42) decapeptide. In order to generate a possible structure for the random peptide, the same starting molecular conformation (S0) of mEGF-(33-42) was used as for the generation of the previous structures. This was mutated to reflect the desired sequence, and the S-ACM groups were added as before, with manual adjustment of the side chain torsion angles. The starting conformation was then minimized and subjected to the same dynamics simulation as the other two structures. The simulation extended to 41.4 ps. Laminin receptor assays were carried out on live cells in suspension at 4°C to prevent possible interference from laminin-induced receptor up-regulation or temperature-dependent laminin polymerization (16Romanov V. Sobel M.E. Dasilva P.P. Menard S. Castronovo V. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1994; 2: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 33Yurchenco P.D. Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7636-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the Lam.B1-(925-933) and mEGF-(33-42) peptides were found to be approximately equipotent with unlabeled native laminin in their respective abilities to compete with binding of 125I-labeled laminin to receptors on the human breast cancer cell line T-47D, and the immortalized human endothelial cell line SK HEP-1. For example, Lam.B1-(925-933), mEGF-(33-42), and laminin displaced the radiolabeled ligand from T-47D cells with respective IC50 values of 1 nM, 3 nM, and 1 nM (see Fig. 1A, Table I). In SK HEP-1 cells, the two synthetic peptides exhibited receptor binding activity close to that of native laminin (IC50 value range ≈ 1.5-2 nM, Table I). This similarity in binding affinities was confirmed in receptor assays of early passage BRCE cells, where laminin, Lam.B1-(925-933), and mEGF-(33-42) were equally active with IC50 values in the range 3-4.3 nM (Table I).Table I.Laminin receptor assayCell lineLamininLam.

Open table in a new tab In contrast, both neuromedin B and random mEGF-(33-42) failed to bind to the laminin receptor on any of the three cell types (Fig. 1A, Table I). Preliminary investigations determined that cell binding to solid-phase laminin becomes increasingly irreversible with time. After addition to the laminin substratum, cells rapidly become resistant to detachment by subsequently added peptides, such that after 15 min of adhesion, additions of mEGF-(33-42) or Lam.B1-(925-933) are completely without effect (not shown). EC50 values were 2-fold higher if cells and peptides were added simultaneously to the laminin substratum, compared with cells pre-equilibrated with the competing peptides. Binding by cell suspensions of mEGF-(33-42) or Lam.B1-(925-933) reached equilibrium by 40 min, as assessed by subsequent laminin attachment assays, and remained steady for up to 4 h of preincubation (not shown). In the final assay configuration (described under “Materials and Methods”), treatment of the T-47D human breast cancer cells with solutions of laminin, Lam.B1-(925-933), or mEGF-(33-42) all resulted in inhibition of cell attachment to the laminin-coated wells. However, in contrast to the results obtained in liquid phase laminin receptor assays, binding to solid phase laminin was more resistant to displacement by the two synthetic peptides compared with displacement by native laminin (Fig. 1B, Table II). In all cell lines tested, concentrations of soluble laminin required for 50% inhibition of attachment (EC50 values) were in the range 0.2-0.3 nM, which is approximately 1000-fold lower than the EC50 values of Lam.B1-(925-933) (230-330 nM) or mEGF-(33-42) (269-380 nM). Similar results were obtained with both established human cell lines (T-47D, SK HEP-1) and primary cultures of endothelial cells (BRCE and avian embryonic endothelial cells).Table II.Laminin attachment assayCell lineLamininLam.B1-(925-933)mEGF-(33-42)Neuromedin BRandom mEGF-(33-42)T-47D0.299 ± 0.013295 ± 16276 ± 16NDNDSK HEP-10.233 ± 0.16272 ± 19264 ± 18NDNDBRCE0.279 ± 0.031326 ± 30351 ± 26NDNDAEECbAvian embryonic endothelial cells.0.308 ± 0.014231 ± 8384 ± 12NDNDND, not detectable.

Parallel incubations with neuromedin B or random mEGF-(33-42) were carried out in all of the above experiments. In all cases, neither of these control peptides caused inhibition up to concentrations of 1 mM. Neither neuromedin B (an unrelated decapeptide included as a negative control) nor the random mEGF-(33-42) peptide had any effect on cell attachment to the laminin substratum when each was tested up to concentrations of 1 mM (Fig. 1B, Table II). Attachment of cells to laminin was found to be blocked by the anti-67-LR antibody (anti-peptide Pro-20-Ala), but was unaffected by similar amounts of the R1 anti-EGF receptor antibody (results not shown). In order to further confirm the specificity of mEGF-(33-42) for the 67-LR, we examined the ability of solid-phase mEGF-(33-42) to support cell adhesion, as has been demonstrated for solid-phase YIGSR (11Massia S.P. Rao S.S. Hubbell J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8053-8059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Graf J. Iwamoto Y. Sasaki M. Martin G.R. Kleinman H.K. Robey F.A. Yamada Y. Cell. 1987; 48: 989-996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Biotinylated mEGF-(33-42), bound to streptavidin-coated microtiter plates, was found to efficiently promote the adhesion of T-47D cells (Fig. 2). The antibody raised against the extracellular portion of 67-LR was found to completely block the attachment of cells to solid-phase mEGF-(33-42); in contrast, the anti-EGF receptor R1 antibody had no effect on cell attachment to solid-phase mEGF-(33-42) (Fig. 2). All three of the modeled peptides showed significantly different folds from the native mEGF starting conformation, as measured by the C-α root mean square deviation values (Table III). Stable structures were obtained at 350 K for mEGF-(33-42), Lam.B1-(925-933), and the random control peptide after 20, 30, and 30 ps, respectively; “sweep” displays of the α-carbon atoms of the individual molecules showed stable folds for the central residues with less stability at the ends of the molecules (Fig. 3). The representative minimized structures (obtained at 22.6, 36.6, and 32.4 ps for mEGF-(33-42), Lam.B1-(925-933), and the random peptide, respectively) are shown in Fig. 4.Table III.Comparative measurements of modeled and native mEGF structures with reference to mEGF-(32-42)PeptideHelix axesRelative positions of C-α atoms (RMSDaRMSD, root mean square deviation. versus mEGF-(33-42)Tyr (P5) orientation (RMSD versus mEGF-(33-42)Tyr (P5) to Arg (P9) distancebMeasured between the tyrosyl oxygen and arginyl Cz atoms.Surface accessibility of Tyr (P5)cUsing a 1.5-Å Connolly probe.MajorMinor(Å)(Å)(Å)(Å)(Å)(Å2)Lam.B1-(925-933)7.7dMeasured between C-α s of P3 and P6 in each minimized structure.6.4eMeasured between C-α s of P4 and P7 in each minimized structure.0.58 (P2-P7)0.2516.280.80.26 (P3-P6)mEGF-(33-42)7.9dMeasured between C-α s of P3 and P6 in each minimized structure.5.9eMeasured between C-α s of P4 and P7 in each minimized structure.11.089.5Random5.6fMean value, C-αn-C-αn+ 2, range n = P2-P6: 5.7, 5.6, 5.5, 5.7, 5.3 Å.NAgNA, inappropriate measurement, due to difference in conformation.NA5.487.2Native mEGFNA0.34 (P2-P6)0.3713.223.2a RMSD, root mean square deviation.b Measured between the tyrosyl oxygen and arginyl Cz atoms.c Using a 1.5-Å Connolly probe.d Measured between C-α s of P3 and P6 in each minimized structure.e Measured between C-α s of P4 and P7 in each minimized structure.f Mean value, C-αn-C-αn+ 2, range n = P2-P6: 5.7, 5.6, 5.5, 5.7, 5.3 Å.g NA, inapp"

Immunohistochemical staining indicated that in the cortex these proteins are perinuclear, or are embedded in the nuclear membrane. Evidence is presented for an endogenous ADP-ribosylation of these proteins, which competes with their PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. The endogenous reaction has the characteristics of nonenzymatic ADP-ribosylation of cysteine residues, known to involve NAD-glycohydrolase activity. In vitro experiments showed that the α-subunit of Go-proteins in the cell membrane also acts as a substrate of this endogenous ADP-ribosylation. The in situ effect of membrane depolarization on the nuclear GTP-binding proteins may be attributable to their depolarization-induced endogenous ADP-ribosylation, suggesting a novel signaling mechanism in neuronal cells in the central nervous system.

The in situ effect of membrane depolarization on the nuclear GTP-binding proteins may be attributable to their depolarization-induced endogenous ADP-ribosylation, suggesting a novel signaling mechanism in neuronal cells in the central nervous system. NAD is the substrate for enzymes that catalyze ADP-ribosylation, i.e. cleavage of the bond between nicotinamide and ribose and the transfer of ADP-ribose to nucleophilic acceptors (1McDonald L.J. Wainschel L.A. Oppenheimer N.J. Moss J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11881-11887Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation represents a mechanism for post-translational modification of proteins. Among the known acceptors for ADP-ribose are GTP-binding proteins in cell membranes (2Althaus F.R. Richter C.R. Mol. Biol. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 37: 140-194Crossref Google Scholar). ADP-ribosyltransferases that catalyze ADP-ribosylation of arginine residues in GTP-binding proteins (similar to cholera toxin) (2Althaus F.R. Richter C.R. Mol. Biol. Biochem.

In this report we present evidence for an endogenous ADP-ribosylation of cysteine residues in GTP-binding protein(s) in the nuclei of cells in rat brain stem and cortex. These proteins also act as substrates of PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation and react with antibodies against the α-subunits of Gi- and Go- proteins (Gαi- and Gαo-proteins). Unlike these membrane G-proteins, however, the nuclear GTP-binding proteins are apparently modified by a nonenzymatic ADP-ribosylation of cysteine residues, which competes with their PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. Also, unlike membrane G-proteins, the nuclear GTP-binding proteins are not extractable by detergents, nor are they activated by membrane depolarization (6Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol.

The evidence presented here is consistent with a depolarization-induced ADP-ribosylation of these nuclear GTP-binding proteins, suggesting a novel signaling mechanism in neuronal cells in the central nervous system. Nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (grade I), adenosine triphosphate (grade I), GDPβS, GTPγS, tetrodotoxin, dithiothreitol (DTT), azidoaniline, sodium nitroprusside, 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB), and thymine were all purchased from Sigma. PTX and the A-protomer of PTX (ADP-ribosyltransferase) were purchased from List Biological Laboratories. [adenylate-32P]Nicotinamide adenine-dinucleotide, di(triethyl-ammonium) salt ([32P]NAD) (1000 Ci/mmol), [32P]GTP (800 Ci/mmol), and (batrachotoxinin-B) (3H-BTX-B) (50 Ci/mmol >99% purity) were purchased from DuPont NEN. [14C]NAD (57 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Corp. Antibodies against the C termini of Gαi- and Gαo-proteins were kindly supplied by Dr. Milligan, Glasgow University, UK. Antibodies against the N terminus of Gαo-proteins (CG/2) and α-common antibodies against the binding sites of GTP in Gi- and Go-proteins (EC/2) were purchased from DuPont. The neurotoxin batrachotoxin (BTX) was kindly supplied by Dr. J. W. Daly, NIH, Bethesda, MD. Adult male rats of the CD strain were maintained as described previously (10Cohen-Armon M. Garty H. Sokolovsky M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Brain stem and cortical regions were obtained from 2-3-month-old rats. Crude nuclei were isolated from pooled rat brain stems or cortex according to a previously described procedure (11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.Chap. 12.1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1991Google Scholar), with slight modifications. The tissues were homogenized in 0.32 M sucrose with a glass/Teflon homogenizer, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 900 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The resulting pellet was resuspended twice in hypotonic solution (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in the same solution and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The final pellet was designated as crude nuclei (11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.Chap. 12.1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1991Google Scholar). In a separate procedure, crude nuclei were isolated on a sucrose gradient (12Snelter C.H. Kricha L. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1979; 24: 129-133Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared from synaptoneurosomes as described elsewhere (13Hollingsworth E.B. McNeal E.T. Burton J.L. Williams R.J. Daly J.W. Creveling C.R. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 2240-2253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat brain stem and cortex were cut into slices (100 μm) with a Sorvall tissue chopper and dispersed either in 0.32 M sucrose, 20 mM Tris-HCl, or in Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 118 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.18 MgCl2, 24.9 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM glucose, and 1.18 mM KH2PO4 in an atmosphere of 95% O2, 5% CO2, pH 7.4. Cells in slices of rat brain cortex and brain stem were depolarized by exposure to high concentrations of K+ in Ca2+-free Krebs-Henseleit buffer solution through an exchange of Na+ for K+ (7Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2595-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In most experiments, membrane depolarization was achieved by an increase in [K+] from 4.7 to 50 mM. Cell membranes were also depolarized by inward Na+ current induced by prolonged activation of the voltage-dependent Na+-channel in the presence of BTX (14Daly J.W. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 1982; 1: 33-86Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Aliquots of membranes or of crude nuclei in Krebs-Henseleit buffer, pH 7.4 (20 μl), were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with [3H]BTX-B at various concentrations (0.1 to 1.1 μM), in the presence or absence of carbamylcholine (10 μM) (10Cohen-Armon M. Garty H. Sokolovsky M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12498-12505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific [3H]BTX-B binding was determined in the presence of 300 μM veratridine (16Creveling C.R. McNeal E.T. Daly J.W. Brown G.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 23: 350-358Google Scholar). The labeled preparations were filtered and washed on GF/C filters and counted for tritium as described previously (10Cohen-Armon M. Garty H. Sokolovsky M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12498-12505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Slices in Ca2+-free Krebs-Henseleit buffer were treated with 2 μg/ml PTX (90 min, 37°C 95% O2, 5% CO2) in Krebs-Henseleit buffer, pH 7.4. [32P]ADP-ribosylation of proteins (200 μg/50 μl) was catalyzed by the A-protomer of PTX (2 μg/ml) in the presence of 9-10 pmol/ml [32P]NAD (1 μCi) in hypotonic buffered solution containing 2 mM ATP, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM EDTA, and 20 mM DTT, according to a previously described procedure (7Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2595-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins in the crude nuclei were [32P]ADP-labeled, in the absence of the PTX A-protomer, by incubation of the nuclei for 30 min at 37°C in the above solution (in which the DTT concentration was changed to 0.5 mM), or by incubation in Krebs-Henseleit buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mM DTT and 10 pmol/ml [32P]NAD. Membranes were [32P]ADP-labeled, in the absence of the PTX A-protomer, by incubation with crude nuclei and [32P]NAD (50 pmol/ml) at 37°C for 30 min in the same hypotonic buffered solution as that used for the PTX- independent reaction in the crude nuclei, but with the addition of the protease inhibitors aprotinin (5 units/ml), pepstatin A (5 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mM). The labeled nuclei or membranes were pelleted, resuspended in sample buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar), and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (7.5 or 10% polyacrylamide). The dried gels were autoradiographed (usually for 24 h at −70°C). Densitometry was performed with a laser densitometer (LKB Broma Ultrascan II). Gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose paper overnight at 10°C and a constant current of 150 mA, as described elsewhere (18Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose strips were exposed to specific antibodies against the N terminus of the α-subunit of Go-protein (19Gierschik P. Milligan G. Pines M. Goldsmith P. Codina J. Klee W. Spiegel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2258-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) or α-common antibodies (20Spiegel A.M. Moss J. Vaughan M. ADP-Ribosylating Toxins and G-proteins: Insights into Signal Transduction. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990: 207Google Scholar), or antibodies against the C termini of αo- and αi-proteins (19Gierschik P. Milligan G. Pines M. Goldsmith P. Codina J. Klee W. Spiegel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2258-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Protein bands with bound antibodies were detected by binding of peroxidase-conjugated second antibody. [azido-32P]GTP was synthesized by incubation of [32P]GTP with azidoaniline and purified by ion-pairing chromatography (21Pfeuffer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7224-7234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crude nuclei in samples containing approximately 200 μg of protein were UV-irradiated (300 nm, 350 W) for 5 min on ice in the presence of [azido-32P]GTP (0.3-0.6 μM). GTP-binding proteins were photolabeled by this procedure as described previously (22Offermans S. Schafer R. Offmann B. Bombien E. Spicher K. Hinsch K.-D. Schultz G. Rosental W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Samples containing 200 μg of protein were applied to isoelectric focusing gels (first dimension) containing 1.8% Ampholines, pH 5-8, and 0.3% Ampholines, pH 3-10. Isoelectric focusing followed by SDS-PAGE (second dimension) was performed according to Ferro-Luzzi and Nikaido (23Ferro-Luzzi A.G. Nikaido K. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 617-623Google Scholar). In the second dimension, gels containing the electrofocused proteins were applied on 10% polyacrylamide slab gels and subjected to SDS-PAGE at room temperature. These gels were then dried and autoradiographed. Brain cortex was cut into small pieces (5 × 5 mm2) and fixed with freshly prepared paraformaldehyde (4%) in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 h at 4°C. The tissue was then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Polyclonal antibodies against the C terminus of Gαi-proteins (kindly donated by Dr. G. Milligan) were localized by a standard immunoperoxidase method (24Polak M.J. Van Noorden S. An Introduction to Immunocytochemistry: Current Techniques and Problems. Royal Microscopical Society, Oxford University Press, Oxford1984Google Scholar). Paraffin sections (4 μm thick) were mounted on slides that were precleaned in 1 N HCl and coated with poly-L-lysine. After drying overnight at 37°C the sections were dewaxed, treated with 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min, and incubated with 3% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Antibody against the C terminus of Gαi-proteins was diluted (1:200) and incubated with the tissue for 16 h at 4°C or for 1 h at 37°C. The antibody was detected by the use of goat anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugated antibody, or alternatively by the use of biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG and avidin-biotin complex peroxidase (ABC; Vector Labs, Burliname, CA). The peroxidase activity was visualized with diaminobenzidine. Antibody specificity was determined by omitting the antibody against the C terminus of Gαi-proteins. All tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. (40,000 cpm/pmol) was prepared from [32P]NAD according to the protocol of McDonald et al. (1McDonald L.J. Wainschel L.A. Oppenheimer N.J. Moss J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11881-11887Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Crude nuclei prepared from rat brain stem and cortical slices were found to contain proteins that are specifically photolabeled with [azido-32P]GTP (Fig. 1A). Like Gαo- and Gαi-proteins in the cell membrane (20Spiegel A.M. Moss J. Vaughan M. ADP-Ribosylating Toxins and G-proteins: Insights into Signal Transduction. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990: 207Google Scholar), these nuclear proteins (39-40 kDa on SDS-PAGE) acted as substrates for PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation (Fig. 1B). The presence of these GTP-binding proteins in the crude nuclei could not be attributed to cytosolic contamination, as only traces of these proteins were found in cytosolic fractions of homogenates prepared from brain stem or cortex (Fig. 1B). In addition, the possibility that they are embedded in membrane residues in the crude nuclear fraction was ruled out by using specific markers (see below). The GTP-binding nuclear proteins reacted with antibodies against both Gαi- and Gαo-proteins in the cell membrane (19Gierschik P. Milligan G. Pines M. Goldsmith P. Codina J. Klee W. Spiegel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2258-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Immunolabeling in crude nuclei revealed, however, that these nuclear proteins were not extractable by treatment with detergents that extract Gαo- and Gαi-proteins from the cell membrane (6Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of these nuclear proteins was even enhanced following detergent treatment, as if the proteins had now become more available as substrates for ADP-ribosyltransferase (PTX A-protomer) (Fig. 1D). The possibility that these proteins are embedded in the nuclear membrane was examined by treatment with citric acid (1%), which separates the nuclear membrane from the inner matrix (25Rubins J.B. Benditt J.O. Dickey B.F. Riedel N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7080-7084Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Compared with controls, the treated nuclei exhibited only faint labeling with antibodies against the C terminus of Gαi-proteins (Fig. 1C). Traces of the [32P]ADP-ribosylated proteins detected in the nuclear extracts were attributed to extraction of these proteins by the citric acid treatment. The possibility that these proteins are embeded in the nuclear membrane was supported by the results of immunohistochemical staining. Post-embedding labeling of paraffin sections of brain cortex (see “Materials and Methods”) with antibodies against the C terminus of Gαi-proteins and the N terminus of Gαo-proteins resulted in intense antibody binding to the cell nuclei (which were counterstained by hematoxylin), with a halo of dark staining at the nuclear borders that was clearly distinguishable from the immunolabeling of the cytoplasm (Fig. 2). Some of the cell nuclei in the section were not labeled (Fig. 2, A and B), and no labeling was observed in control samples in which the anti-Gαi or anti- Gαo-antibody was omitted (Fig. 2C). The specific immunolabeling supports the presence of these proteins in the crude nuclei (Figs. 1C and 2). Poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) activity was used as a marker of the nuclear fraction (26Udea K. Moss J. Vaughan M. ADP-Ribosylating Toxins and G-proteins: Insights into Signal Transduction. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990: 525Google Scholar) (see Figs. 1, 7, and 8). Significant contamination of the crude nuclei by cell membranes during preparation was excluded by the use of [3H]BTX-B (a labeled derivative of the lipophilic neurotoxin, batrachotoxin), which binds specifically to voltage-dependent Na+-channels in the cell membrane (15Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12498-12505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27McNeal E.T. Lewandowski G.A. Daly J.W. Creveling C.R. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). No such binding was detected in crude nuclei isolated from slices of brain stem or brain cortex, while binding of [3H]BTX-B to membranes prepared from these brain regions was similar to that observed previously in membranes prepared from brain synaptoneurosomes (15Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12498-12505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in agreement with our previous findings, the specific binding of [3H]BTX-B in membranes was stimulated by muscarinic agonists (10Cohen-Armon M. Garty H. Sokolovsky M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12498-12505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating a possible interaction between muscarinic receptors and voltage-dependent Na+-channels in the cell membrane (8Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9824-9838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cohen-Armon M. Garty H. Sokolovsky M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12498-12505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this effect was not observed in the crude nuclear fraction (Fig. 3). These differences between BTX-B binding in cell membranes and in the crude nuclei were attributed to the lack of voltage-dependent Na+-channels and muscarinic receptors and hence of membrane residues in the crude nuclei.Fig. 8Effect of free ADP-ribose on the [32P]ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins in brain cortex. A, [32P]ADP-ribosylation of proteins in crude nuclei prepared from brain cortical slices was performed in the absence of PTX-A protomer (lane 1) and in the presence of ADP-ribose at concentrations of 5 μM (lane 2) and 50 μM (lane 3). The labeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and autoradiographed (n = 3). Each lane contained 200 μg protein (41Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Each lane contained 200 μg of protein. C, [32P]ADP-ribosylation of proteins in crude nuclei prepared from brain cortical slices was performed with [32P]ADP-ribose (140,000 cpm/pmol) in the absence of PTX A-protomer (lane 1) and with [32P]NAD (1000 Ci/mmol) in the presence of PTX A-protomer (lane 2). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and autoradiographed. Each lane contained 200 μg of protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Specific binding of [3H]BTX-B to voltage-dependent Na+-channels as a marker for membrane residues in the crude nuclear preparation. Specific binding of [3H]BTX-B (control (•) and stimulated by 10 μM carbamylcholine (○)) to voltage-dependent Na+-channels was measured in membranes prepared from brain stem synaptoneurosomes and in crude nuclei prepared from brain stem slices. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of veratridine (300 μM) (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) GTP-binding proteins (39-40 kDa) in crude nuclei prepared from brain stem or cortical slices, that act as substrates for [32P]ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by the PTX-A protomer, were [32P]ADP-labeled by incubation of the nuclei with [32P]NAD even in the absence of the PTX A-protomer (Fig. 4). These proteins were labeled in nuclei incubated at 37°C for 30 min, either in the hypotonic buffered solution used for their PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, in which DTT concentration was reduced to 0.5 mM, or in Krebs-Henseleit buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mM DTT. PTX-catalyzed [32P]ADP-ribosylation of GTP-binding proteins in crude nuclei that had been preincubated under the above experimental conditions in the absence of [32P]NAD and PTX A-protomer was inhibited by 62 ± 5% (n = 10) (Fig. 4, lane 2), suggesting that an endogenous reaction of NAD with these nuclear proteins during preincubation may have interfered with their subsequent PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. The PTX-independent [32P]ADP-labeling of the nuclear proteins in the presence of [32P]NAD (Fig. 4, lane 3) was temperature-dependent (inactive at 4°C and optimal at 37°C), suggesting the possible involvement of an enzymatic process. In addition, this labeling was inhibited by 40 ± 5% (n = 3) in the presence of GTPγS (100 μM) (Fig. 4, lane 8), reminiscent of the effect of GTPγS on ADP-ribosylation of membrane Gi- and Go-proteins, which are better substrates for PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation in their nonactivated than in their activated state (28Neer E.J. Lok J.M. Wolf L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14222-14229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, labeling of the nuclear G-proteins in control preparations was not enhanced by GDPβS (100 μM) (n = 3) (Fig. 4, lane 7). Changes in [32P]ADP-labeling of the nuclear proteins were quantified by scanning analysis (see “Materials and Methods”). Inhibition of PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of the 39-40-kDa proteins in preincubated brain stem crude nuclei was also detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Crude nuclear proteins were [32P]ADP-ribosylated by PTX A-protomer after preincubation of the cell nuclei under the experimental conditions employed for their PTX-independent ADP-ribosylation, but in the absence of [32P]NAD (i.e. 37°C, 30 min, Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 0.5 mM DTT) (Fig. 5A). Subsequent PTX-catalyzed [32P]ADP-ribosylation of the 39-40-kDa proteins, which reacted with antibodies against the C terminus of Gαi-proteins, was inhibited in the preincubated nuclei (Fig. 5A). This inhibition may be attributable to an endogenous ADP-ribosylation of these proteins, as indicated by their PTX-independent reaction with [32P]NAD (Fig. 4). Since ADP-ribosylation of the 39-40-kDa proteins would decrease their isoelectric pH, the possibility that these proteins act as substrates of an endogenous ADP-ribosylation was further examined by comparing their isoelectric pH in crude nuclei before and after incubation under conditions enabling their PTX-independent [32P]ADP-labeling on exposure to [32P]NAD. Measurement of the mobility shifts of these nuclear proteins on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed a shift toward acidic pH, detected by immunolabeling of the blotted proteins with antibodies against Gαi-proteins following either their PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation or their incubation under conditions inducing competition with their PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. The isoelectric pH of the blotted 39-40-kDa proteins in untreated nuclei was less acidic by approximately 0.5 pH units (n = 3) (Fig. 5B). The possibility that cysteine residues in the 39-40-kDa proteins are acceptors for endogenous ADP-ribosylation in the crude nuclei was examined by the use of cell membrane Gαi- and Gαo- proteins as substrates (29Van Meurs K.P. Angus C.W. Lavu S. Kung H.-F. Czarnecki S.K. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3107-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Membranes prepared from brain stem or cortical synaptoneurosomes (7Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2595-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with crude nuclei prepared from these brain regions, in the presence of protease inhibitors, in buffered hypotonic solution containing [32P]NAD (10 pmol, 1000 Ci/mmol), 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM EDTA, 2 mM ATP, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The crude nuclei in this mixture had been preincubated for 30 min at 37°C in the absence of [32P]NAD in order to prevent subsequent [32P]ADP-labeling of the 39-40-kDa nuclear proteins (see Fig. 4, Fig. 5). After incubation, the labeled membranes were separated from the mixture by the following procedure. The incubated mixture was centrifuged (30,000 × g, 15 min), and the pellet was resuspended in isotonic sucrose (0.32 M) 1:50 (v/v) and centrifuged (800 × g, 15 min). The pellet, which contained the crude nuclei, was removed. A protein band (100 kDa), which includes poly(ADP-ribosylated) proteins (see Figs. 1B, 7, and 8), was used as a marker for the crude nuclear fraction (Figs. 6A). The supernatant was centrifuged (800 × g, 15 min), the pellet was removed, six volumes of 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, were added to the supernatant, and the mixture was centrifuged (30,000 × g, 15 min). The resulting pellet contained cell membranes (12Snelter C.H. Kricha L. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1979; 24: 129-133Google Scholar). Proteins in the last pelleted fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted. Proteins (39 kDa) that were specifically immunolabeled with antibodies against the N terminus of Gαo-proteins had also been [32P]ADP-labeled during incubation with the crude nuclei and [32P]NAD (Fig. 6). No [32P]ADP-labeling of membrane proteins was observed following their incubation with [32P]NAD in the absence of crude nuclei (Fig. 6A). The [32P]ADP-labeling of the 39-kDa membrane protein was susceptible to proteases (see “Materials and Methods”) and to cleavage of thioglycoside bonds by mercuric ions (4McDonald L.J. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6238-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), suggesting that an endogenous reaction in the crude nuclei that competes with PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation (Fig. 4, Fig. 5) might have catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of cysteine residues in membrane Gαo-proteins. For further verification, the products of the PTX-independent reaction, i.e. the [32P]ADP-labeled proteins in membranes prepared from brain cortex, were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, blotted, and subjected to immunolabeling with antibodies against the N terminus of Gαo-proteins (Fig. 6B). Proteins (39 kDa) in membranes preincubated with crude nuclei and [32P]NAD by the above procedure were found to be both [32P]ADP-labeled and immunolabeled with antibodies against Gαo-pro"
https://openalex.org/W1981279166,"The mechanism by which depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores activates Ca2+ influx is not understood. We recently showed that primaquine, an inhibitor of vesicular transport, blocks the activation of the calcium release-activated calcium current (ICRAC) in rat megakaryocytes (Somasundaram, B., Norman, J. C., and Mahaut-Smith, M. P. (1995) Biochem. J. 309, 725-729). Since it is well established that vesicular transport is temperature-sensitive, we have investigated the effect of temperature on both the activation and maintenance of store-mediated Ca2+ and Mn2+ influx in the human leukemic cell line KU-812 using a combination of whole cell ICRAC recordings and measurements of Mn2+ photoquench of fura-2. Activation of ICRAC was temperature-sensitive, showing a nonlinear reduction when the temperature was lowered from 27 to 17°C with an abrupt change at 21-22°C and complete inhibition at 17°C. Once activated, ICRAC also displayed an abrupt reduction at 21-22°C but was not completely blocked even when the temperature was reduced to 14°C, suggesting that at least one of the temperature-sensitive components is exclusively involved in ICRAC activation. Activation of store-mediated Mn2+ influx also showed similar nonlinear temperature sensitivity and complete inhibition at 19°C. However, in contrast to ICRAC measurements, lowering the temperature following maximal activation of the influx pathway at 37°C did not result in any detectable residual Mn2+ entry below 19°C. We conclude that the mechanism of store-mediated Ca2+ influx involves temperature-dependent steps in both its maintenance and activation, suggesting dependence on a lipid membrane environment. The mechanism by which depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores activates Ca2+ influx is not understood.

In many nonexcitable cells, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate activates Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane, a phenomenon termed “capacitative Ca2+ entry” (Putney, 29Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2077) Google Scholar). This Ca2+ entry pathway was first characterized electrophysiologically in mast cells and named “calcium release-activated calcium current” (ICRAC) 1The abbreviations used are: ICRACcalcium release-activated calcium currentGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)[Ca2+]ifree cytosolic Ca2+ concentrationTGthapsigarginBAPTA1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidQ10temperature coefficientEaactivation energyETH(−)-(R,R)-N,N′-bis-[11-(ethoxycarbonyl)undecyl]-N,N′-4,5-tetramethyl-3,6-dioxaoctane-diamide, diethyl-N,N′-[(4R5R)-4,5-dimethyl-1,8-dioxo-3,6-dionachamethylene]bis(12-methylaminododecanoate).

Store depletion-activated currents with different properties from ICRAC have been described in some cell types (Lückhoff and Clapham, 20Lückhoff A. Clapham D.E. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 177-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar; Vaca and Kunze 41Vaca L. Kunze D.L. Am. J.

(Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (655) Google Scholar; Zweifach and Lewis, 45Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. 1994; 15: 77-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). ICRAC is distinguishable from other store-dependent influx currents by being highly selective for Ca2+ and having a single channel conductance below the resolution of patch clamp recordings (Hoth and Penner, 15Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (655) Google Scholar; Zweifach and Lewis, 45Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby depletion of Ca2+ stores is coupled to the activation and control of ICRAC is still unclear. Several signaling mechanisms have been proposed, including direct coupling of the store and plasma membrane via protein-protein interaction (Irvine, 16Irvine R.F. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3085-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) or release of a small, nonproteinaceous phosphate-containing second messenger from the Ca2+ stores that diffuses to the plasma membrane (Randriamampita and Tsien, 31Randriamampita C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9706-9708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A number of other biochemical modulators have been implicated in the control of ICRAC, including cytochrome P-450, phosphatases, tyrosine kinases, cGMP (for review, see Sargeant and Sage, 35Sargeant P. Sage S.O. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 395-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and protein kinase C (Parekh and Penner, 27Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has also been postulated that store depletion may cause insertion of ICRAC channels into the plasma membrane from specialized vesicles (Fasalato et al., 9Fasalato C. Innocenti B. Pozzan T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 77-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) following evidence of a role of small GTP-binding proteins in ICRAC activation (Fasalato et al., 8Fasalato C. Hoth M. Penner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20737-20740PubMed Google Scholar; Bird and Putney, 3Bird G.S.J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21486-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the well recognized role of these molecules in vesicular transport (Pryer et al., 28Pryer N.K. Wuestehube L.J. Schekman R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 471-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). We recently provided evidence to further support this notion by showing that two established inhibitors of vesicle-mediated protein transport, the antimalarial amine primaquine and GTPγS, block the appearance of ICRAC in response to store depletion in rat megakaryocytes (Somasundaram et al., 38Somasundaram B. Norman J.C. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Primaquine is far less effective if added after ICRAC has developed. Thus the channels responsible for ICRAC or a molecule activating the channel may be held in a membrane compartment and transported to the plasma membrane following depletion of stores (Somasundaram et al., 38Somasundaram B. Norman J.C. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is also well established that vesicular transport is temperature-sensitive and is blocked below temperatures ranging from 16 to 18°C (Matlin and Simons 22Matlin K.S. Simons K. Cell. 1983; 34: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar; Tartakoff, 40Tartakoff A.M.

A. 1986; 83: 6425-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study, we have investigated the effect of temperature on the activation and maintenance of store-mediated Ca2+ influx in a human leukemic cell line, KU-812 (Nakazawa et al., 25Nakazawa M. Mitjavila M.T. Debili N. Casadevall N. Mayeux P. Rouyer-Fessard P. Dubart A. Roméo P.H. Beuzard Y. Kishi K. Breton-Gorius J. Vainchenker W. Blood. 1989; 73: 2003-2013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using a combination of whole cell patch clamp recordings and fluorescent photoquench of fura-2. The KU-812 cell line was selected because it displayed a high ICRAC channel density and an ability to load and retain the Ca2+-sensitive dye fura-2 and because of the availability of large numbers of cells for population studies of Mn2+ quench. KU-812 cells were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research, Wiltshire, United Kingdom) and cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in a standard external solution (see below). Thapsigargin (TG), valinomycin, and ionomycin were obtained from Calbiochem, and fura-2/AM and pluronic acid F-127 were from Molecular Probes, Inc., (Eugene, OR). All these agents were prepared as stocks in dimethyl sulfoxide. Cs4-BAPTA was from Molecular Probes (Eugene OR), and all other reagents were from Sigma. Patch clamp experiments were performed in the conventional whole cell configuration (Hamill et al., 12Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakman B. Sigworth F.J. Pflueg. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15066) Google Scholar) by means of an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass tubing (Clark Electromedical Instruments) and had filled resistances of 2-3 megaohms. Series resistances were in the range of 10-30 megaohms, and 40-70% series resistance compensation was used. The cells were stored at 23-24°C in a standard external solution containing 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 (adjusted with Tris) before transfer to the recording chamber. All recordings were conducted in an external solution in which Na+ and K+ ions were replaced by equal concentrations of positively charged n-methyl-D-glucamine and Cs+, respectively. The internal saline contained 60 mM cesium gluconate, 20 mM Cs4-BAPTA, 5 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, (adjusted with Tris). This Ca2+/BAPTA mixture maintained [Ca2+]i near resting cytosolic levels and reduced the chance of spontaneous activation of ICRAC due to leaking of Ca2+ from internal stores that often occurred with BAPTA alone. TG (3 μM) was applied from a puffer pipette placed 150 μm from the cell. A diffusible factor required for activation of ICRAC is washed out during whole cell recordings from rat megakaryocytes (Somasundaram et al., 38Somasundaram B. Norman J.C. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and rat basophilic leukemic cells (Fasalato et al., 8Fasalato C. Hoth M. Penner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20737-20740PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of dialysis of the cytoplasm will depend on the whole cell access resistance. Therefore, to allow comparison of ICRAC in different cells, the time after breakthrough to the whole cell mode was normalized for series resistance, and thapsigargin was applied at a standard normalized time range of 9 s megaohm−1. Cells were held at −20 mV, and current-voltage relationships were obtained at regular intervals using 300-ms voltage ramps from −140 to +60 mV. The membrane currents during voltage ramps were low pass filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 100 μs using a Digidata 1200 interface and pClamp software (Axon Instruments). A continuous record of whole cell current was also obtained using a Cairn Research computer interface and associated software (Cairn Research Ltd., Kent, UK) following acquisition at a rate of 60 Hz (low pass filtered at approximately 30 Hz). Liquid junction potentials were measured by reference to a 3 M KCl agar bridge, and membrane potentials were adjusted accordingly. Currents were normalized for cell capacitance, and ICRAC was measured as the amount of inward current that developed in response to TG at a given voltage. In the electrophysiological experiments the temperature of the recording chamber was adjusted by a combination of a heating block and a heat exchanger controlled by a Peltier element. A gravity-fed perfusion system was used to exchange the saline in the experimental chamber. With this system the temperature of the recording chamber could be varied from 14 to 30°C. Temperature was measured with a thermistor positioned 1 mm from the cell. At each temperature selected, the cell was allowed to equilibrate for at least 2 min before whole cell configuration was established. In experiments in which the effect of temperature on the maintenance of ICRAC was measured, the whole cell configuration was established at 24°C, and the temperature was lowered at a rate of approximately 0.1°C/s. In the fluorescence experiments the temperature was controlled by a water jacket connected to a heating-cooling system, which enabled the temperature to be varied between 10 and 37°C. In the calcium electrode experiments the temperature was changed between 15 and 30°C using a Peltier element. Ca2+ was determined with a Ca2+-sensitive minielectrode suspended in 60 μl of permeabilized cell suspension solution stirred by a magnetic agitator. The Ca2+ minielectrodes were prepared using a protocol similar to that of Clapper and Lee (6Clapper D.L. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13947-13954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The electrode membrane was made with a Ca2+ electrode mixture (Fluka Chemical Corp.) containing 4.15 mg of ETH 1001 Ca2+ ionophore, 37 mg of S-nitrophenyloctyl ether, 0.42 mg of sodium tetraphenyl borate, and 24 mg of polyvinyl chloride dissolved in 240 μl of tetrahydrofuran. The electrode was filled with a 10 mM CaCl2 solution and connected to a Genway 3040 pH and ion analyzer. The minireference (3 M KCl) electrode used (ULTRAWICK™) was purchased from World Precision Instruments, Inc. The electrode was calibrated at 15, 20, and 30°C using various Ca2+-EGTA buffers and displayed a linear response within the range of 0.1-100 μM free Ca2+ (25 mV/pCa2+ unit). Cells were washed in a solution containing 120 mM KCl, 25 mM HEPES, 3 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM EGTA, washed again in the same solution without EGTA, and finally resuspended in this non-EGTA-containing solution at a final concentration of 2 × 108 cells/ml. The cells were then stored on ice until use. For each experiment, 25 μl of the cell suspension was warmed to 37°C, and digitonin was added to give a final concentration of 40 μM and incubated for 2 min. The cell suspension was made up to 60 μl with non-EGTA-containing solution, phosphocreatine (10 mM), creatine kinase (20 units/ml), and 3 mM ATP and then transferred to form a droplet into which the calcium electrode tip was placed. The temperature was adjusted as required before experimentation. Fura-2 fluorescence measurements were carried out on cell populations in a final volume of 1.5 ml (106 cells/ml) using a Cairn spectrophotometer system. Excitation wavelengths of 340, 360, and 380 nm were provided by a filter wheel rotating at 35 Hz in the light path. Emitted light was filtered by a 485 nm long pass filter and samples averaged to give a data point every 500 ms. The background-corrected 340:380 ratio was multiplied by the dissociation constants for fura-2 at different temperatures obtained from Shuttleworth and Thompson (36Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1410-1414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to give an indication of [Ca2+]i. The isosbestic excitation wavelength (360 nm) was used to monitor the fura-2 photoquench by Mn2+; an established measure of influx through the Ca2+ store-activated influx pathway. Cells were loaded with fura-2 by incubation with 1 μM fura-2/AM and 0.025% Pluronic F127 for 30 min at 24°C in standard external solution containing 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose, 2 mg/ml apyrase, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 (adjusted with Tris), and 1 mM CaCl2. The apyrase was used to minimize purinergic receptor activation, which may be caused by ATP or ADP released from damaged cells. The cells were spun down and resuspended in the standard external solution with 2 mM CaCl2 and split into 100-ml aliquots each containing 106 cells and stored at room temperature until use. Prior to experimentation the cells were spun and resuspended in 100 ml of nominally Ca2+-free standard external medium with the K+ ionophore valinomycin (1 mM). Valinomycin was then present throughout the experiment allowing the cell membrane potential to be “clamped” close to the reversal potential of K+ (approximately −80 mV). No differences in Mn2+ influx were observed (at 16 and 37°C) when valinomycin was added immediately or 6 min before measurement of Mn2+ photoquench (n = 3). To study the effect of temperature on activation of store-dependent Mn2+ influx, the 100-μl cell aliquot was added to 1.4 ml of medium at the required temperature. After a 30-s delay, 100 nM TG was added, followed 6 min later by 100 μM Mn2+. To measure basal Mn2+ influx, 100 μM Mn2+ was added in place of TG, after a 30-s incubation at the required temperature. To study the effects of temperature on the maintenance of the store-mediated Mn2+ influx pathway, the stores were emptied first by adding 100 nM TG to the 100-μl cell suspension in nominally Ca2+-free standard external medium and incubated for 6 min at 37°C. The cell suspension was then added to the cuvette containing 1.4 ml of nominally Ca2+-free standard external medium at the required temperature. After a 30-s delay, 100 μM Mn2+ was added, and the quench was measured. In controls, the 100-μl cell suspensions were incubated at 37°C without TG for the same length of time but with 1 mM added Ca2+ to prevent any passive store depletion during incubation. To quantify Mn2+ entry, the slopes of the fura-2 photoquench over the first 15 s after Mn2+ addition were determined. The very initial, sharp drop in fluorescence observed in some experiments, due to external free dye, was not included in the calculations. The degree of TG-induced store depletion was assessed at both 34 and 18°C by comparing the ionomycin-induced (5 μM) Ca2+ rise before and after a 6-min incubation with TG. To eliminate the contribution of Ca2+ influx to these measurements, 0.1 mM EGTA was added to the external medium immediately before addition of ionomycin. Cytosolic ATP concentrations were measured using an ATP assay kit (Calbiochem) based on the firefly luciferase-catalyzed oxidation of D-luciferin in the presence of an ATP-magnesium salt and oxygen. A cell suspension (3 × 105 cells/ml) in standard external medium was incubated at the desired temperature for 8 min, spun, and resuspended in HEPES buffer, pH 7.75, containing a permeabilizing reagent (Calbiochem). To assess ATP released from the cytoplasm, luciferase was added, and the peak amount of photons emitted was measured using a photomultiplier tube (Thorn EMI Electron Tubes Ltd., Ruislip, Middlesex, UK) coupled to a spectrophotometer (Cairn). Luminescence following addition of luciferase was measured and subtracted from luminescence in the absence of cells. The cytosolic ATP concentration was calculated using a measured mean cell diameter of 10 μm and assuming the cytosolic volume to be 20% of the total cell volume. Temperature coefficient (Q10) values were determined for current densities and Mn2+ influx rates within a given temperature range using Q10 = (P1/P2)10/(T1 −T2), where P1 and P2 are current densities at temperature T1 and T2, respectively. Activation energy (Ea) was determined from an equation describing the slope of the Arrhenius plot: Ea = R (lnP1− lnP2)/(1/T1 − 1/T2), where R is the gas constant. To study ICRAC in KU-812 cells, conditions were selected that have been shown to enhance this small current and largely eliminate contributions from other ionic currents (Somasundaram et al., 38Somasundaram B. Norman J.C. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar; see “Materials and Methods”). Briefly, the external medium contained 2 mM Ca2+ and no K+ or Na+, and any outward K+ currents were blocked by replacing the internal K+ with Cs+. The [Ca2+]1 was strongly buffered with 20 mM BAPTA. Under whole cell voltage clamp, depletion of internal Ca2+ stores by 3 μM TG, an endoplasmic Ca-ATPase inhibitor, evoked an inward current at a holding potential of −50 mV (Fig. 1A). The currents generated by voltage ramps from −140 to + 50 mV before TG application and at various times during the development of the inward current are shown in Fig. 1B. This inwardly rectifying current showed little or no reversal within the voltage range studied, developed without detectable single channel events, was selective for Ca2+ (data not shown), and was blocked by 1 mM Zn2+ (data not shown), all of which are characteristic of ICRAC reported in other cells (Fasalato et al., 9Fasalato C. Innocenti B. Pozzan T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 77-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar; Somasundaram et al., 38Somasundaram B. Norman J.C. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To study the effect of temperature on the activation of ICRAC, cells were held at various temperatures ranging from 15 to 27°C, and the current evoked by TG was recorded. The currents activated at a holding potential of −20 mV at four different temperatures are shown in Fig. 1C. The maximum TG-induced current density was reduced with decreasing temperature such that no measurable current was activated at or below 17°C. The speed of development of the current was also reduced, and the times to half-maximum current were 82 ± 12, 72 ± 8, 55 ± 9, and 50 ± 7 s at 19, 20, 23, and 26°C, respectively. At maximal activation, the current-voltage relationship generated by voltage ramps from −140 mV to +50 mV at the different temperatures did not show any obvious shift in the reversal potential along the x axis (Fig. 1D). It should be noted that it was not technically possible to perform whole cell patch clamp recordings from cells held at temperatures greater than 27°C due to rapid deterioration of glass membrane seals. The TG-evoked ICRAC densities, measured at −120 mV, in individual cells at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 2A. Despite the considerable variation in current density between cells, there is a clear positive correlation between current density and temperature. This relationship is further illustrated in Fig. 2B, in which the mean current density values at −120, −70, and −20 mV are plotted against temperature. Over the temperature range of 27 to 21°C the current density at all three voltages displayed little change, whereas further lowering of temperature caused a significant decrease in current, which became blocked completely at 17°C. To describe quantitatively the temperature dependence of the current density, we have presented the same data in the form of Arrhenius plots (Fig. 2C). The current density decreases linearly as temperature is lowered from 27 to 22°C, and from the slope, apparent Ea values of 4.3 kcal/mol (Q10 = 1.11), 5.1 kcal/mol (Q10 = 1.26), and 5.8 kcal/mol (Q10 = 1.18) were calculated at −120, −70, and −20 mV, respectively. On lowering the temperature from 21 to 17°C, there was an abrupt increase in the Ea by a factor of approximately 33 to give Ea values of 161 kcal/mol (Q10 = 196), 178 kcal/mol (Q10 = 67), and 167 kcal/mol (Q10 = 180) at the respective voltages, reflecting a very high energy barrier at the lower temperatures. For both the high and low temperature ranges, the activation energies were similar at different membrane potentials, suggesting that these steps were not voltage-dependent. Although depletion of Ca2+ stores at 17°C failed to induce an inward current, an increase in temperature several min after TG application at 17°C resulted in ICRAC activation, as shown by the experiment in Fig. 3. The current-voltage relationships at 17°C 2 min after TG application (Fig. 3B, trace b) showed no evidence of a store-dependent current, whereas this current slowly developed following a temperature increase to 20°C (Fig. 3B, trace c). A further abrupt increase in temperature to 28°C produced a parallel increase in ICRAC (Fig. 3B, trace d), and furthermore, this temperature-dependent effect was reversible, as shown by the currents obtained at 20°C before and after increasing the temperature to 28°C (Fig. 3B, traces c and e). We next studied the effect of temperature on ICRAC following full activation at 24°C, to determine whether the temperature dependence arose primarily from an effect on the activation mechanism of the current or via a direct effect on the influx pathway itself. In the experiments of Fig. 4, ICRAC was maximally activated by TG-induced store depletion at 24.5°C before the temperature was lowered to 14.5°C at a rate of 0.1°C/s and then returned to 24.5°C. A continuous record of ICRAC at a holding potential of −60 mV is shown in Fig. 4A, and current-voltage relationships at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 4B. Fig. 4C shows the average current density at −120 and −70 mV calculated from 10 cells at different temperatures following protocols similar to that of Fig. 4A and shows the complete reversibility of this temperature block. When the temperature was dropped from 24.5 to 22°C, the inhibition of current density was of a level (Fig. 5A) very similar to that observed when measuring temperature effects on ICRAC activation (Fig. 2B). However, reduction in temperature from 22 to 14.5°C resulted in incomplete inhibition of current. Even at 14.5°C, the ICRAC current density remained at 44% of maximum, in contrast to the complete inhibition at this temperature observed for ICRAC activation (Fig. 2B). Indeed, even after prolonged incubations of up to 3 min at 14°C, cells still maintained substantial amounts of ICRAC (data not shown). This was in contrast to the complete block of ICRAC activation observed at this temperature (Fig. 2A). To quantitatively describe the temperature dependence of ICRAC maintenance, the mean current densities were plotted against temperature in the form of an Arrhenius plot (Fig. 5B) from which Ea values were calculated for temperatures from 24.5 to 22°C of 5 kcal/mol (Q10 = 1.4) at −120 mV and 2.2 kcal/mol (Q10 = 1.1) at −70 mV. From 22 to 14.5°C, the Ea values increased to 23 kcal/mol (Q10 = 3.5) at −120 mV and 35 kcal/mol (Q10 = 5.6) at −70 mV. Although patch clamp recordings of ICRAC give a direct measure of Ca2+ influx, the current is measured under nonphysiological ionic conditions. In addition, as a result of the whole cell patch configuration, dialysis of the cytosol may lead to removal of intracellular components controlling Ca2+ influx. These potential problems were minimized by investigating the effect of temperature on store-mediated Ca2+ influx in intact cells using Mn2+ as a surrogate permeable ion and measuring the rate of the Mn2+-induced photoquench of cytosolic fura-2 at different temperatures. The experimental protocol is illustrated in Fig. 6A and shows a greatly increased Mn2+ quench in cells depleted at 37°C than in cells depleted at 16°C. TG-induced store release led to a substantial increase in Mn2+ influx compared with nondepleted cells at 32°C (Fig. 6B, traces c and d). At 10°C, however, the photoquench in store-depleted cells was indistinguishable from that in nondepleted cells (Fig. 6B, traces a and b). The differences in the Mn2+ photoquench between store-depleted and nondepleted cells at 10, 16, 22, and 32°C are shown in Fig. 6C. From this basal-subtract"
https://openalex.org/W2009642222,"We report the isolation and characterization of a novel cDNA from quail neuroretina encoding a putative protein named nectinepsin. The nectinepsin cDNA identifies a major 2.2-kilobase mRNA that is detected from ED 5 in neuroretina and is increasingly abundant during embryonic development. A nectinepsin mRNA is also found in quail liver, brain, and intestine and in mouse retina. The deduced nectinepsin amino acid sequence contains the RGD cell binding motif of integrin ligands. Furthermore, nectinepsin shares substantial homologies with vitronectin and structural protein similarities with most of the matricial metalloproteases. However, the presence of a specific sequence and the lack of heparin and collagen binding domains of the vitronectin indicate that nectinepsin is a new extracellular matrix protein. Furthermore, genomic Southern blot studies suggest that nectinepsin and vitronectin are encoded by different genes. Western blot analysis with an anti-human vitronectin antiserum revealed, in addition to the 65- and 70-kDa vitronectin bands, an immunoreactive protein of about 54 kDa in all tissues containing nectinepsin mRNA. It seems likely that the form of vitronectin found in chick egg yolk plasma by Nagano et al. ((1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 24863-24870) is the protein that corresponds to the nectinepsin cDNA.

https://openalex.org/W2005372537,"Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) associates with an α subunit (CNTFRα) of the receptor complex to initiate signal transduction by facilitating heterodimerization of the gp130 transducing protein and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) β. CNTFRα is anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage; however, a soluble form of the α subunit can still bind CNTF to recruit the signal transducing components of the receptor complex. In the present study we show that alanine substitution for residues Thr268 and Asp269 of the CNTFRα subunit results in a mutated receptor subunit (R3), which can bind CNTF with an affinity similar to that of the wild type CNTFRα but, when expressed as a soluble receptor subunit, lowers the binding of CNTF to its tripartite receptor. In addition, CNTFR3α inhibits the proliferation of the TF1 hematopoietic cell line triggered by CNTF plus soluble wild type CNTFRα but not by IL-6 or oncostatin M. Similarly, CNTFR3α specifically antagonizes the induction of gp130 and LIFRβ tyrosine phosphorylation observed in response to CNTF and wild type soluble CNTFRα in the HepG2 hepatoma cell line, as well as the subsequent events leading to haptoglobin synthesis. Positions 268 and 269 of CNTFRα appear to be critical for its interaction with gp130 and LIFRβ, whereby alanine substitution of the residues at these positions results in antagonism of the CNTF-induced response."
https://openalex.org/W2043545169,"We attached human transferrin to Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) to specifically localize this toxin to the endosomal compartment and study its translocation from purified endosomes using a cell-free assay. Transferrin was linked to PE via a disulfide bond. Chemical derivatization inactivated the PE cell-binding domain, and transferrin-PE was found to be endocytosed via the transferrin receptor only. Transferrin was also conjugated to a truncated PE with no receptor-binding domain (PE46). After labeling mouse lymphocytes with radiolabeled transferrin-PE or transferrin-PE46 and endosome isolation, selective translocation of the full-sized toxin portion of the conjugate was observed in a cell-free system. This translocation was strictly dependent upon ATP hydrolysis and was not affected when the acidity of the endosome lumen was neutralized using weak bases, protonophores, or bafilomycin A1. Nevertheless, when present during cell labeling, inhibitors of endosome acidification prevented PE from acquiring translocation competence. Similar inhibition was observed when endocytosis was performed in the presence of brefeldin A, a drug known to interfere with the delivery of endocytic tracers to acidic endosomes. Our data indicate that full-length PE can be transferred to the cytosol directly from endosomes during intoxication by PE conjugates and that, although exposure to acidic pH is a prerequisite for translocation, ATP hydrolysis directly provides the energy required for PE translocation."
