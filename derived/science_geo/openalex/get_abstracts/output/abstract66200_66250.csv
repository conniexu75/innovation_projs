The alpha-galactosidase activity in the leukocytes of female carriers of the disease is 15 to 40 percent of the amount present in normal leukocytes. The activities of beta-galactosidase, beta-acetylgalactosaminidase, and beta-acetylglucosaminidase in the leukocytes of affected individuals are normal."

Glial membrane specific resistance is low (approximately 200 to 500 ohm centimeters squared. Neuroglial cells are ideally suited to buffer the immediate extraneuronal space at areas of synaptic contact against the increases in external potassium ion concentration that accompany postsynaptic and spike activity and to minimize the spread of potassium ions to other pre- and postsynaptic regions."

The free food was then presented while subjects were pressing on several reinforcement schedules. Subjects continued to press for reinforcement when one or two presses were required for reinforcement, and ate little free food. When ten presses were required for reinforcement, rats preferred free food and pressed little or not at all. It was concluded that, when work demands are not too high, rats prefer earned food to free food."
https://openalex.org/W1515009017,"The formation of ceramide from long chain bases and 14C-acyl coenzyme A's by a mouse brain microsomal preparation was investigated. Activity of the acyl-CoA:long chain base N-acyltransferase was measured as a function of time, acyl-CoA concentration, amount of amine, and microsomal protein concentration. The rate and extent of conversion of stearoyl-, lignoceroyl-, palmitoyl-, and oleoyl-CoA to ceramide were in the ratio of about 60:12:3:1, respectively. Since this ratio strongly resembles the relative distribution of these fatty acids in brain sphingolipids, we suggest that the transferase plays an important role in controlling the observed distribution. There was some specificity with respect to the base, particularly with lignoceroyl-CoA, which reacted somewhat better with dihydrosphingosine than with sphingosine. The keto analogue of dihydrosphingosine acted as an acceptor, with stearoyl-CoA, to form ketoceramide. The microsomal preparation also converted the acyl-CoAs to free fatty acid and polar lipid during the incubations. Ceramide synthesis was found to occur primarily in microsomal membranes, but ceramide hydrolase was rather widely distributed in subcellular fractions; its highest specific activity was in the lysosome-rich fractions. Free stearic acid did not react to form ceramide, yet it could react with ethanolamine to form the analogous amide. From these and related considerations, we conclude that the synthetic capability of ceramide hydrolase has little or no physiological significance."

Facilitation of this rhythm through conditioning selectively enhances a similar pattern recorded during sleep, the familiar spindle burst. The training also produced longer epochs of undisturbed sleep. The specific neural mechanism manipulated during wakefulness appears to function also in sleep and to be involved with the regulation of phasic motor behavior."

https://openalex.org/W1508889369,"Abstract Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1) was isolated and purified approximately 60-fold from bovine adrenal medullae. The final product appears homogeneous by column chromatography, electrophoresis, and ultracentrifugation. The enzyme gave a s20,w of 3.0 S with a molecular weight by Sephadex chromatography of 38,000. No cofactors were needed for the reaction. The pH optimum was 7.9 in either Tris or borate buffers. Titration with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate showed that 8.5 moles of sulfhydryl were titrated per mole of enzyme of 38,000 molecular weight and that activity was lost on titration of 2 moles of sulfhydryl groups per mole of enzyme. Kinetic measurements indicated a complex reaction mechanism which is best described as a random binding of substrates with S-adenosylmethionine being kinetically preferred as the first substrate bound."

https://openalex.org/W1545566831,"Abstract The glucagon immunoreactivity present in canine pancreatic extracts can be separated by gel filtration into two fractions; one fraction, comprising over 90% of the immunoreactivity, is similar in molecular size to the glucagon-131I marker, while the other appears to be at least twice as large. Incubation of this large glucagon immunoreactivity (LGI) in solutions such as 1 m acetic acid, 8 m urea, 0.1 m mercaptoethanol, or 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, which favor the dissociation of noncovalent protein complexes, fails to change its molecular size as determined by gel filtration, suggesting that LGI is not glucagon noncovalently bound either to itself or to another protein. However, tryptic hydrolysis of LGI results in the disappearance of most of the immunoreactivity and in a reduction in the molecular size of the remaining immunoreactivity to approximately that of glucagon-131I. Neither LGI nor its tryptic product, both of which resemble glucagon immunologically, has glycogenolytic activity in the perfused rat liver. It is possible that LGI includes the immunoreactive sequence of glucagon or of an immunologically similar peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1613995184,"Abstract Polyribonucleotides that contain 7-methylguanylic acid have been prepared and used to determine the base-pairing properties of 7-methylguanine in templates for RNA polymerase. Experiments with copolymers of uridylic and 7-methylguanylic acids indicate that 7-methylguanine can still pair normally with cytosine to produce copolymers of adenylic and cytidylic acids. When copolymers of cytidylic and 7-methylguanylic acids are incubated with GTP and UTP, some abnormal base pairing is evident between 7-methylguanine and uracil. However, this is at the same level as abnormal pairing between guanine and uracil, and can be blocked by the addition of CTP to the incubation mixture. It is concluded that the base-pairing properties of 7-methylguanine and guanine are very similar in this assay system."

https://openalex.org/W1480317558,"Abstract Porcine plasma and erythrocytes were found to contain the same glycosphingolipids as humans, namely glucosyl ceramide, lactosyl ceramide, galactosylgalactosylglucosyl ceramide, and globoside, and the actual concentrations were very similar. The in vivo studies were carried out by using uniformly labeled 14C-d-glucose as the isotopic precursor and isolating the glycolipids from 30-ml samples of blood removed at frequent intervals over the 3-month study period. The results suggested that erythrocyte lactosyl ceramide, galactosylgalactosylglucosyl ceramide and globoside were synthesized in the bone marrow, did not exchange with their plasma counterparts, and were released into the plasma at the time of general erythrocyte catabolism. Erythrocyte glucosyl ceramide did not appear to be synthesized in the marrow and was in dynamic equilibrium with plasma glucosyl ceramide. The label was rapidly and randomly incorporated into all the plasma glycosphingolipids but after 9 days no labeling could be detected until the erythrocytes began to be catabolized (50 to 70 days). The relative amounts of label in the glycolipids during the 1st week and the latter period from 40 to 60 days confirmed that the rapid source of plasma glycosphingolipid biosynthesis is a minor pathway and showed that the release or catabolism of erythrocyte glycosphingolipids (especially globoside, the major component) is the major source of all four plasma glycosphingolipids."

https://openalex.org/W1516897247,"Abstract Urocanase was purified 60-fold and crystallized from extracts of Pseudomonas putida. Crystalline preparations of the enzyme were homogeneous by ultracentrifugal and electrophoretic criteria. Urocanase has an s20,w of 7.6 S, and a molecular weight of 110,000 ± 4,000 was calculated from sedimentation equilibrium data. Electrophoresis of the enzyme in 4 m urea resulted in a dissociation of the native protein into two electrophoretically distinct fractions. Urocanase has a specific activity of 5.1 µmoles of urocanate degraded per min per mg of protein when measured at pH 7.5 and extrapolated to saturating substrate concentration. The Michaelis constant is 0.24 mm. Urocanase was inactivated upon treatment with carbonyl inhibitors such as hydroxylamine and semicarbazide, which suggests that an enzyme-bound carbonyl group was required for the catalytic process. Pyridoxal phosphate was ruled out as a cofactor on the basis of enzyme spectral measurements and direct pyridoxal phosphate analysis. Reduction of urocanase with tritiated sodium borohydride resulted in the complete inactivation of the enzyme and led to the stable incorporation of slightly less than 1 g atom of hydrogen per mole of enzyme. Hydrolysis of labeled enzyme released a radioactive compound which was identified as α-hydroxybutyrate by paper chromatography, by high voltage electrophoresis, and by formation of a p-bromophenacyl ester identical with one prepared from authentic α-hydroxybutyrate. These results indicate that the native urocanase contains a covalently bound α-ketobutyrate which is essential for catalytic activity. A mechanism for urocanase action is presented to explain the role of α-ketobutyrate in the reaction process."

The salt- and acid-extracted collagens differ little in their chemical composition, and produce galactobiitol and galactotriitol in the same ratio upon alkaline borohydride treatment. These oligosaccharide chains appear to be linked directly to threonine and serine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1650694890,"Staphylococcal nuclease reacts stoichiometrically at tyrosine 115 with the diazonium derivative of deoxythymidine 3'-p-aminophenylphosphate 5'-phosphate. This reaction, which results in enzymatic inactivation, can be prevented by addition of the competitive inhibitor, deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate, or by the omission of Ca++ from the reaction mixture. Specific modification of the tryptophan residue at position 140 and of the histidine residue at position 46 occurs upon treating the enzyme with the diazonium derivative of deoxythymidine 3'-p-aminophenylphosphate. The diazonium derivative of deoxythymidine 5'-p-aminophenylphosphate reacts selectively with tyrosine 85. The chemical exploration of the binding site of this enzyme with a variety of affinity labeling reagents permits certain stereochemical formulations that can be used to compare the solution and crystal structures of this protein."

https://openalex.org/W1576823044,"Abstract The collagen synthesized by minced feet of 7- to 10-day-old chick embryos labeled with radioactive proline remained adsorbed to carboxymethyl cellulose columns under the usual conditions for eluting collagen α and β components. In contrast, the collagen synthesized by 16- to 19-day-old lathyritic minces gave the expected α1 and α2 components under these chromatographic conditions. Such older, lathyritic minces were therefore used to examine the nature of the protocollagen that was synthesized when the hydroxylation of collagen prolyl residues was inhibited by α,α'-dipyridyl. Unlike the identically prepared collagen, such protocollagen samples failed to give appreciable α components under the usual chromatographic conditions, but remained adsorbed to the column. Inclusion of 4 m urea in the chromatographic buffers, however, caused appearance of an elution profile from protocollagen samples identical in position and number of peaks with that given by collagen. These collagen peaks could be shown to be α components by disc electrophoresis. Two of the peaks from protocollagen were shown by gel filtration to be the same in size as the corresponding two peaks from collagen. These protocollagen species were, therefore, the size of α chains. The elution position of these two peaks, as well as the effect of injecting β-aminopropionitrile or d-penicillamine into the embryos prior to preparing the minces, suggested that they represented, respectively, the α1 chain in which the e-amino group of a lysine residue had been deaminated to yield an aldehyde (α1ald), and the α1 chain in which the lysine residue was still intact (α1lys). Both peaks gave predominantly the original peak on rechromatography, except that much of the radioactivity remained adsorbed to the column, until eluted by a high concentration of salt. In the case of the α1lys peak, addition of some of the original mince extract to the sample, prior to rechromatography, decreased this adsorption and enabled the original peak to reappear."

https://openalex.org/W1510861176,"Abstract The cytochromes in hamster brown fat cells were identified by trapped steady state spectra using liquid nitrogen. Simultaneous measurements of oxygen consumption and cytochrome b changes at 430 – 410 nm were made. Using the above techniques, fatty acids, released from triglyceride stores by norepinephrine, have been shown to have a dual function: (a) provision of substrate for oxidative breakdown; (b) regulation of energy transfer for control of respiration. The second function has been shown to operate mainly prior to the incorporation of inorganic phosphate in the oxidative phosphorylation sequence by experiments with oligomycin. Summarized are studies on other systems which suggest that fatty acids exert their effect on energy coupling at the same level at which uncoupling agents act. Experiments with succinate and α-glycerol phosphate as substrates are presented and discussed with reference to either differential extent or tightness of coupling at Sites I, II, and III along the respiratory chain, or both of these factors."

Two plants that each contained 36 Tripsacum and 14 maize chromosomes were deprived from the F(1) of maize x Tripsacum. Chromo. somes of these plants frequently formed 25 bivalents, 18 between Tripsacum chromosomes and seven between maize chromosomes. Maize chromosomes could be distinguished from Tripsacum chromosomes on the basis of size. The withint-genome pairing is probably induced by the genetic background."
https://openalex.org/W1522747168,"Fatty acids can be synthesized in mitochondrial membranes of rat liver either by elongation or by synthesis de novo. The outer membranes incorporate greater amounts of substrate into fatty acids than do the inner membranes. Outer membranes synthesize 6- and 8-carbon fatty acids completely de novo, while smaller amounts of 10-carbon acids are produced by the mechanism de novo. The reactions de novo utilize acetyl coenzyme A more effectively than malonyl coenzyme A, and synthesis de novo occurs in the absence of exogenous ATP. Elongation, which produces fatty acids 14 carbon atoms long and longer, depends on added ATP, and acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA are incorporated about equally. Synthesis de novo of shorter chain fatty acids by outer membranes continues in the presence of ATP and the concomitant elongation reactions. Inner membranes synthesize only longer fatty acids by elongation. If synthesis de novo of fatty acids occurs in the inner membranes, these acids might be removed by oxidation. The ATP concentrations in these experiments were compared with the levels of ATP produced by actively respiring liver mitochondria. During metabolically adverse conditions within the cell, the capacity for manufacturing fatty acids by elongation may fluctuate with the ATP levels whereas synthesis de novo continues."
https://openalex.org/W1527963668,Abstract Deaggregation of human hemoglobin in solutions of high ionic strength is pH-dependent in the range 6 to 8.5. The pH optimum for aggregation of deoxy- is lower than that for oxyhemoglobin. The known favored deaggregation of oxyover deoxyhemoglobin is further characterized; the difference is more marked at lower pH values in this range. A similar difference is also seen when deaggregation is induced by acidification to pH 4.7. At high ionic strengths and also at pH 4.7 the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin is concentration-dependent. This dependence can be related to differences in deaggregation of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin through linkage relations.

There is a need for improved methods of specific sensitive and quantitative determination of these compounds in samples of interest. Polarographic methods3–6 are sensitive to rather less than one part per million but they lack specificity. Thin layer chromatography7–9 offers a measure of discrimination between N-nitrosamines, but the methods so far developed are not entirely satisfactory. A specific and sensitive gas chromatographic method for N-alkylnitrosamines is described below."
https://openalex.org/W1575695860,"Abstract The rates at which the sulfhydryl groups on each chain of hemoglobin β4 react with N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetate have been measured. The sulfhydryl group at position 93 reacts with both alkylating agents at approximately the same rate as normal liganded hemoglobin. The sulfhydryl group at position 112, which is not available in normal hemoglobin, reacts in hemoglobin β4 and does so much more rapidly than does the sulfhydryl at position 93. The rapidly and slowly reacting groups were identified by isolation of tryptic peptides labeled with 14C-N-ethylmaleimide or 14C-iodoacetate. Because of the different rates of reaction of the two sulfhydryl groups, it was possible to produce a derivative carboxymethylated only at position 112. This modification makes the β chains unable to form tetramers. They have a sedimentation coefficient of 1.88 S which corresponds to monomers."
https://openalex.org/W1535241281,"Abstract Appearance of the enzyme mutarotase in kidney and intestine of embryonic and newborn rats was compared with the ability of these tissues to transport sugars. Kidney enzyme was first detected in the 17-day-old embryo, but levels in both the embryonic and the newborn kidney were marginal compared to those in the adult. A rapid and progressive increase in mutarotase levels which began immediately following birth correlated well with the increase in tubular volume. The mutarotase content of the fully developed kidney was about 1200 international enzyme units per g. Mutarotase appeared earlier in embryonic intestine (Day 15) and increased to almost double the adult level in the 24 hours preceding birth. Levels of the intestinal enzyme returned to normal at the end of the suckling period. Measurements of functional capacity to transport sugars were made with the use of 3H-d-galactose as the test sugar. Kidney slices from newborn animals did not concentrate d-galactose under conditions which allowed establishment of 3- to 5-fold gradients with adult tissue. In contrast, a sugar transport mechanism was well developed in the newborn rat intestine. A phloridzin-sensitive preferential uptake of 3H-d-galactose was observed with both 14C-inulin and 14C-d-mannose as reference compounds. The studies show that the mutarotase content of developing kidney and intestine correlates well with the development of active transport processes for sugars in these tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1527298275,"Abstract A model is proposed whereby serum albumin synthesis is expressed in terms of production of inorganic sulfate in the liver or in the entire organism, following the administration of 35S-l-cystine. The feasibility of the proposed method was tested by comparing the synthesis rate of rat serum albumin with the catabolic rate of the radioiodinated protein measured in the same animal. A good agreement between the two rates was noted in a group of adult rats, whereas an excess of anabolism was observed in young growing animals. The equilibration between hepatic and plasma radiosulfate concentration was complete within 4 hours after the injection of 35S-cystine. The advantages and limitations of the proposed method in the measurement of the absolute rate of synthesis of liver-produced plasma proteins are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1507104581,"Abstract The tetrameric molecule of hemoglobin has two different interfaces between unlike chains. The residues in these contact regions serve both to hold the molecule together and to mediate the cooperative interactions which attend the saturation of hemoglobin with ligand. In this paper, we describe experiments designed to show how much disruption of the subunit contact surfaces can be tolerated without destroying the physical and functional integrity of the molecule. We studied two derivatives of human hemoglobin with modifications in the same interface. In the first, the sulfhydryl group at position 112 on the β chain was carboxymethylated. In the second, the —SH group at position 104 on the α chain was reacted with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. When the modified chains were mixed with their normal partners, they recombined to form dimers and tetramers. The criteria of recombination were electrophoretic mobility and sedimentation velocity. Both derivatives showed qualitatively the same change in function: loss of cooperative interactions, increased oxygen affinity, and decreased Bohr effect. This was more marked when the α chain was modified. These experiments, together with those already in the literature, indicate that interference with any interface reduces cooperative function and shifts the dissociation equilibrium toward the dimer."

https://openalex.org/W1501956727,"Abstract Hemoglobins αa, αpmb, and βpmb (where PMB is pmercuribenzoate) lack the pH-dependent and form-dependent ultraviolet difference spectra seen in hemoglobin A. Hemoglobin H exhibits difference spectra which are smaller than those in hemoglobin A and, in the case of pH-dependent spectra, at different wave length location. A difference spectrum of reconstitution of hemoglobin A from hemoglobins αa and H exists at pH 8.5 but not at pH 6. The major perturbation in this spectrum is probably attributable to the chromophore of tyrosine C7α(42)."
