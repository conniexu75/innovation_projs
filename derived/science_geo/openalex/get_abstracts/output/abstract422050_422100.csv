https://openalex.org/W2092943609,"Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. Although infection with microorganisms is not involved in the development of heart failure in most cases, inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure. However, the mechanisms responsible for initiating and integrating inflammatory responses within the heart remain poorly defined. Mitochondria are evolutionary endosymbionts derived from bacteria and contain DNA similar to bacterial DNA. Mitochondria damaged by external haemodynamic stress are degraded by the autophagy/lysosome system in cardiomyocytes. Here we show that mitochondrial DNA that escapes from autophagy cell-autonomously leads to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9-mediated inflammatory responses in cardiomyocytes and is capable of inducing myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Cardiac-specific deletion of lysosomal deoxyribonuclease (DNase) II showed no cardiac phenotypes under baseline conditions, but increased mortality and caused severe myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy 10 days after treatment with pressure overload. Early in the pathogenesis, DNase II-deficient hearts showed infiltration of inflammatory cells and increased messenger RNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, with accumulation of mitochondrial DNA deposits in autolysosomes in the myocardium. Administration of inhibitory oligodeoxynucleotides against TLR9, which is known to be activated by bacterial DNA, or ablation of Tlr9 attenuated the development of cardiomyopathy in DNase II-deficient mice. Furthermore, Tlr9 ablation improved pressure overload-induced cardiac dysfunction and inflammation even in mice with wild-type Dnase2a alleles. These data provide new perspectives on the mechanism of genesis of chronic inflammation in failing hearts."
https://openalex.org/W2105711740,"P2X receptors are trimeric ATP-activated ion channels permeable to Na+, K+ and Ca2+. The seven P2X receptor subtypes are implicated in physiological processes that include modulation of synaptic transmission, contraction of smooth muscle, secretion of chemical transmitters and regulation of immune responses. Despite the importance of P2X receptors in cellular physiology, the three-dimensional composition of the ATP-binding site, the structural mechanism of ATP-dependent ion channel gating and the architecture of the open ion channel pore are unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the zebrafish P2X4 receptor in complex with ATP and a new structure of the apo receptor. The agonist-bound structure reveals a previously unseen ATP-binding motif and an open ion channel pore. ATP binding induces cleft closure of the nucleotide-binding pocket, flexing of the lower body β-sheet and a radial expansion of the extracellular vestibule. The structural widening of the extracellular vestibule is directly coupled to the opening of the ion channel pore by way of an iris-like expansion of the transmembrane helices. The structural delineation of the ATP-binding site and the ion channel pore, together with the conformational changes associated with ion channel gating, will stimulate development of new pharmacological agents."

https://openalex.org/W2059772834,"tert-Butoxy-(4-phenyl-quinolin-3-yl)-acetic acids (tBPQA) are a new class of HIV-1 integrase (IN) inhibitors that are structurally distinct from IN strand transfer inhibitors but analogous to LEDGINs. LEDGINs are a class of potent antiviral compounds that interacts with the lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) binding pocket on IN and were identified through competition binding against LEDGF. LEDGF tethers IN to the host chromatin and enables targeted integration of viral DNA. The prevailing understanding of the antiviral mechanism of LEDGINs is that they inhibit LEDGF binding to IN, which prevents targeted integration of HIV-1. We showed that in addition to the properties already known for LEDGINs, the binding of tBPQAs to the IN dimer interface inhibits IN enzymatic activity in a LEDGF-independent manner. Using the analysis of two long terminal repeat junctions in HIV-infected cells, we showed that the inhibition by tBPQAs occurs at or prior to the viral DNA 3'-processing step. Biochemical studies revealed that this inhibition operates by compound-induced conformational changes in the IN dimer that prevent proper assembly of IN onto viral DNA. For the first time, tBPQAs were demonstrated to be allosteric inhibitors of HIV-1 IN displaying a dual mode of action: inhibition of IN-viral DNA assembly and inhibition of IN-LEDGF interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2048205090,"Autophagy is a cellular process directed at eliminating or recycling cellular proteins. Recently, the autophagy pathway has been implicated in immune dysfunction, the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders, and response to viral infection. Associations between two genes in the autophagy pathway, ATG5 and ATG7, with childhood asthma were investigated.Using genetic and experimental approaches, we examined the association of 13 HapMap-derived tagging SNPs in ATG5 and ATG7 with childhood asthma in 312 asthmatic and 246 non-allergic control children. We confirmed our findings by using independent cohorts and imputation analysis. Finally, we evaluated the functional relevance of a disease associated SNP.We demonstrated that ATG5 single nucleotide polymorphisms rs12201458 and rs510432 were associated with asthma (p = 0.00085 and 0.0025, respectively). In three independent cohorts, additional variants in ATG5 in the same LD block were associated with asthma (p<0.05). We found that rs510432 was functionally relevant and conferred significantly increased promotor activity. Furthermore, Atg5 expression was increased in nasal epithelium of acute asthmatics compared to stable asthmatics and non-asthmatic controls.Genetic variants in ATG5, including a functional promotor variant, are associated with childhood asthma. These results provide novel evidence for a role for ATG5 in childhood asthma."

https://openalex.org/W1974856908,"Ocean acidification, caused by elevated seawater carbon dioxide levels, may have a deleterious impact on energetic processes in animals. Here we show that high PCO2 can suppress metabolism, measured as oxygen consumption, in the pteropod, L. helicina forma antarctica, by ∼20%. The rates measured at 180–380 µatm (MO2 = 1.25 M−0.25, p = 0.007) were significantly higher (ANCOVA, p = 0.004) than those measured at elevated target CO2 levels in 2007 (789–1000 µatm, = 0.78 M−0.32, p = 0.0008; Fig. 1). However, we further demonstrate metabolic plasticity in response to regional phytoplankton concentration and that the response to CO2 is dependent on the baseline level of metabolism. We hypothesize that reduced regional Chl a levels in 2008 suppressed metabolism and masked the effect of ocean acidification. This effect of food limitation was not, we postulate, merely a result of gut clearance and specific dynamic action, but rather represents a sustained metabolic response to regional conditions. Thus, pteropod populations may be compromised by climate change, both directly via CO2-induced metabolic suppression, and indirectly via quantitative and qualitative changes to the phytoplankton community. Without the context provided by long-term observations (four seasons) and a multi-faceted laboratory analysis of the parameters affecting energetics, the complex response of polar pteropods to ocean acidification may be masked or misinterpreted."
https://openalex.org/W2020256091,"Background Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain syndrome with unknown etiology and a wide spectrum of symptoms such as allodynia, debilitating fatigue, joint stiffness and migraine. Recent studies have shown some evidences demonstrating that oxidative stress is associated to clinical symptoms in FM of fibromyalgia. We examined oxidative stress and bioenergetic status in blood mononuclear cells (BMCs) and its association to headache symptoms in FM patients. The effects of oral coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation on biochemical markers and clinical improvement were also evaluated. Methods We studied 20 FM patients and 15 healthy controls. Clinical parameters were evaluated using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), visual analogues scales (VAS), and the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6). Oxidative stress was determined by measuring CoQ10, catalase and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels in BMCs. Bioenergetic status was assessed by measuring ATP levels in BMCs. Results We found decreased CoQ10, catalase and ATP levels in BMCs from FM patients as compared to normal control (P<0.05 and P<0.001, respectively) We also found increased level of LPO in BMCs from FM patients as compared to normal control (P<0.001). Significant negative correlations between CoQ10 or catalase levels in BMCs and headache parameters were observed (r = −0.59, P<0.05; r = −0.68, P<0.05, respectively). Furthermore, LPO levels showed a significant positive correlation with HIT-6 (r = 0.33, P<0.05). Oral CoQ10 supplementation restored biochemical parameters and induced a significant improvement in clinical and headache symptoms (P<0.001). Discussion The results of this study suggest a role for mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in the headache symptoms associated with FM. CoQ10 supplementation should be examined in a larger placebo controlled trial as a possible treatment in FM."
https://openalex.org/W2075489369,"Protective proteases are key elements of protein quality control pathways that are up-regulated, for example, under various protein folding stresses. These proteases are employed to prevent the accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins that can impose severe damage to cells. The high temperature requirement A (HtrA) family of serine proteases has evolved to perform important aspects of ATP-independent protein quality control. So far, however, no HtrA protease is known that degrades protein aggregates. We show here that human HTRA1 degrades aggregated and fibrillar tau, a protein that is critically involved in various neurological disorders. Neuronal cells and patient brains accumulate less tau, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuritic plaques, respectively, when HTRA1 is expressed at elevated levels. Furthermore, HTRA1 mRNA and HTRA1 activity are up-regulated in response to elevated tau concentrations. These data suggest that HTRA1 is performing regulated proteolysis during protein quality control, the implications of which are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2028606847,"Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIα (PI4KIIα) is predominantly Golgi-localized, and it generates >50% of the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate in the Golgi. The lipid kinase activity, Golgi localization, and ""integral"" membrane binding of PI4KIIα and its association with low buoyant density ""raft"" domains are critically dependent on palmitoylation of its cysteine-rich (173)CCPCC(177) motif and are also highly cholesterol-dependent. Here, we identified the palmitoyl acyltransferases (Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) PATs) that palmitoylate PI4KIIα and show for the first time that palmitoylation is cholesterol-dependent. DHHC3 and DHHC7 PATs, which robustly palmitoylated PI4KIIα and were colocalized with PI4KIIα in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), were characterized in detail. Overexpression of DHHC3 or DHHC7 increased PI4KIIα palmitoylation by >3-fold, whereas overexpression of the dominant-negative PATs or PAT silencing by RNA interference decreased PI4KIIα palmitoylation, ""integral"" membrane association, and Golgi localization. Wild-type and dominant-negative DHHC3 and DHHC7 co-immunoprecipitated with PI4KIIα, whereas non-candidate DHHC18 and DHHC23 did not. The PI4KIIα (173)CCPCC(177) palmitoylation motif is required for interaction because the palmitoylation-defective SSPSS mutant did not co-immunoprecipitate with DHHC3. Cholesterol depletion and repletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin reversibly altered PI4KIIα association with these DHHCs as well as PI4KIIα localization at the TGN and ""integral"" membrane association. Significantly, the Golgi phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate level was altered in parallel with changes in PI4KIIα behavior. Our study uncovered a novel mechanism for the preferential recruitment and activation of PI4KIIα to the TGN by interaction with Golgi- and raft-localized DHHCs in a cholesterol-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2011290663,"Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved degradation process of cytoplasmic cellular constituents. It has been suggested that autophagy plays a role in tumor promotion and progression downstream oncogenic pathways; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been elucidated. Here, we provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence of a novel signaling pathway whereby the oncogene KRAS induces the expression of VMP1, a molecule needed for the formation of the authophagosome and capable of inducing autophagy, even under nutrient-replete conditions. RNAi experiments demonstrated that KRAS requires VMP1 to induce autophagy. Analysis of the mechanisms identified GLI3, a transcription factor regulated by the Hedgehog pathway, as an effector of KRAS signaling. GLI3 regulates autophagy as well as the expression and promoter activity of VMP1 in a Hedgehog-independent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that GLI3 binds to the VMP1 promoter and complexes with the histone acetyltransferase p300 to regulate promoter activity. Knockdown of p300 impaired KRAS- and GLI3-induced activation of this promoter. Finally, we identified the PI3K-AKT1 pathway as the signaling pathway mediating the expression and promoter activity of VMP1 upstream of the GLI3-p300 complex. Together, these data provide evidence of a new regulatory mechanism involved in autophagy that integrates this cellular process into the molecular network of events regulating oncogene-induced autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2082628782,"Many neurons receive excitatory glutamatergic input almost exclusively onto dendritic spines. In the absence of spines, the amplitudes and kinetics of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) at the site of synaptic input are highly variable and depend on dendritic location. We hypothesized that dendritic spines standardize the local geometry at the site of synaptic input, thereby reducing location-dependent variability of local EPSP properties. We tested this hypothesis using computational models of simplified and morphologically realistic spiny neurons that allow direct comparison of EPSPs generated on spine heads with EPSPs generated on dendritic shafts at the same dendritic locations. In all morphologies tested, spines greatly reduced location-dependent variability of local EPSP amplitude and kinetics, while having minimal impact on EPSPs measured at the soma. Spine-dependent standardization of local EPSP properties persisted across a range of physiologically relevant spine neck resistances, and in models with variable neck resistances. By reducing the variability of local EPSPs, spines standardized synaptic activation of NMDA receptors and voltage-gated calcium channels. Furthermore, spines enhanced activation of NMDA receptors and facilitated the generation of NMDA spikes and axonal action potentials in response to synaptic input. Finally, we show that dynamic regulation of spine neck geometry can preserve local EPSP properties following plasticity-driven changes in synaptic strength, but is inefficient in modifying the amplitude of EPSPs in other cellular compartments. These observations suggest that one function of dendritic spines is to standardize local EPSP properties throughout the dendritic tree, thereby allowing neurons to use similar voltage-sensitive postsynaptic mechanisms at all dendritic locations."
https://openalex.org/W1992395427,"In the postgenomic era, bioinformatic analysis of sequence similarity is an immensely powerful tool to gain insight into evolution and protein function. Over long evolutionary distances, however, sequence-based methods fail as the similarities become too low for phylogenetic analysis. Macromolecular structure generally appears better conserved than sequence, but clear models for how structure evolves over time are lacking. The exponential growth of three-dimensional structural information may allow novel structure-based methods to drastically extend the evolutionary time scales amenable to phylogenetics and functional classification of proteins. To this end, we analyzed 80 structures from the functionally diverse ferritin-like superfamily. Using evolutionary networks, we demonstrate that structural comparisons can delineate and discover groups of proteins beyond the “twilight zone” where sequence similarity does not allow evolutionary analysis, suggesting that considerable and useful evolutionary signal is preserved in three-dimensional structures.

https://openalex.org/W2033183800,"Chromogranin A knock-out (Chga-KO) mice display increased adiposity despite high levels of circulating catecholamines and leptin. Consistent with diet-induced obese mice, desensitization of leptin receptors caused by hyperleptinemia is believed to contribute to the obese phenotype of these KO mice. In contrast, obesity in ob/ob mice is caused by leptin deficiency. To characterize the metabolic phenotype, Chga-KO mice were treated with the CHGA-derived peptide catestatin (CST) that is deficient in these mice. CST treatment reduced fat depot size and increased lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. In liver, CST enhanced oxidation of fatty acids as well as their assimilation into lipids, effects that are attributable to the up-regulation of genes promoting fatty acid oxidation (Cpt1α, Pparα, Acox, and Ucp2) and incorporation into lipids (Gpat and CD36). CST did not affect basal or isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production in adipocytes but inhibited phospholipase C activation by the α-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist phenylephrine, suggesting inhibition of α-AR signaling by CST. Indeed, CST mimicked the lipolytic effect of the α-AR blocker phentolamine on adipocytes. Moreover, CST reversed the hyperleptinemia of Chga-KO mice and improved leptin signaling as determined by phosphorylation of AMPK and Stat3. CST also improved peripheral leptin sensitivity in diet-induced obese mice. In ob/ob mice, CST enhanced leptin-induced signaling in adipose tissue. In conclusion, our results implicate CST in a novel pathway that promotes lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation by blocking α-AR signaling as well as by enhancing leptin receptor signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2063987356,"Eukaryotic cells generate energy in the form of ATP, through a network of mitochondrial complexes and electron carriers known as the oxidative phosphorylation system. In mammals, mitochondrial complex I (CI) is the largest component of this system, comprising 45 different subunits encoded by mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Humans diagnosed with mutations in the gene NDUFS4, encoding a nuclear DNA-encoded subunit of CI (NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone Fe-S protein 4), typically suffer from Leigh syndrome, a neurodegenerative disease with onset in infancy or early childhood. Mitochondria from NDUFS4 patients usually lack detectable NDUFS4 protein and show a CI stability/assembly defect. Here, we describe a recessive mouse phenotype caused by the insertion of a transposable element into Ndufs4, identified by a novel combined linkage and expression analysis. Designated Ndufs4fky, the mutation leads to aberrant transcript splicing and absence of NDUFS4 protein in all tissues tested of homozygous mice. Physical and behavioral symptoms displayed by Ndufs4fky/fky mice include temporary fur loss, growth retardation, unsteady gait, and abnormal body posture when suspended by the tail. Analysis of CI in Ndufs4fky/fky mice using blue native PAGE revealed the presence of a faster migrating crippled complex. This crippled CI was shown to lack subunits of the “N assembly module”, which contains the NADH binding site, but contained two assembly factors not present in intact CI. Metabolomic analysis of the blood by tandem mass spectrometry showed increased hydroxyacylcarnitine species, implying that the CI defect leads to an imbalanced NADH/NAD+ ratio that inhibits mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation.

https://openalex.org/W2094170482,"There has been increased interest in discovering combinations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are strongly associated with a phenotype even if each SNP has little individual effect. Efficient approaches have been proposed for searching two-locus combinations from genome-wide datasets. However, for high-order combinations, existing methods either adopt a brute-force search which only handles a small number of SNPs (up to few hundreds), or use heuristic search that may miss informative combinations. In addition, existing approaches lack statistical power because of the use of statistics with high degrees-of-freedom and the huge number of hypotheses tested during combinatorial search. Due to these challenges, functional interactions in high-order combinations have not been systematically explored. We leverage discriminative-pattern-mining algorithms from the data-mining community to search for high-order combinations in case-control datasets. The substantially improved efficiency and scalability demonstrated on synthetic and real datasets with several thousands of SNPs allows the study of several important mathematical and statistical properties of SNP combinations with order as high as eleven. We further explore functional interactions in high-order combinations and reveal a general connection between the increase in discriminative power of a combination over its subsets and the functional coherence among the genes comprising the combination, supported by multiple datasets. Finally, we study several significant high-order combinations discovered from a lung-cancer dataset and a kidney-transplant-rejection dataset in detail to provide novel insights on the complex diseases. Interestingly, many of these associations involve combinations of common variations that occur in small fractions of population. Thus, our approach is an alternative methodology for exploring the genetics of rare diseases for which the current focus is on individually rare variations."
https://openalex.org/W1964586355,"The biosynthetic pathway for staphyloxanthin, a C(30) carotenoid biosynthesized by Staphylococcus aureus, has previously been proposed to consist of five enzymes (CrtO, CrtP, CrtQ, CrtM, and CrtN). Here, we report a missing sixth enzyme, 4,4'-diaponeurosporen-aldehyde dehydrogenase (AldH), in the staphyloxanthin biosynthetic pathway and describe the functional expression of the complete staphyloxanthin biosynthetic pathway in Escherichia coli. When we expressed the five known pathway enzymes through artificial synthetic operons and the wild-type operon (crtOPQMN) in E. coli, carotenoid aldehyde intermediates such as 4,4'-diaponeurosporen-4-al accumulated without being converted into staphyloxanthin or other intermediates. We identified an aldH gene located 670 kilobase pairs from the known staphyloxanthin gene cluster in the S. aureus genome and an aldH gene in the non-staphyloxanthin-producing Staphylococcus carnosus genome. These two putative enzymes catalyzed the missing oxidation reaction to convert 4,4'-diaponeurosporen-4-al into 4,4'-diaponeurosporenoic acid in E. coli. Deletion of the aldH gene in S. aureus abolished staphyloxanthin biosynthesis and caused accumulation of 4,4'-diaponeurosporen-4-al, confirming the role of AldH in staphyloxanthin biosynthesis. When the complete staphyloxanthin biosynthetic pathway was expressed using an artificial synthetic operon in E. coli, staphyloxanthin-like compounds, which contained altered fatty acid acyl chains, and novel carotenoid compounds were produced, indicating functional expression and coordination of the six staphyloxanthin pathway enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2083849440,"We have developed a new biodegradable scaffold that does not require any cell seeding to create an in-situ tissue-engineering vasculature (iTEV). Animal experiments were conducted to test its characteristics and long-term efficacy. An 8-mm tubular biodegradable scaffold, consisting of polyglycolide knitted fibers and an L-lactide and ε-caprolactone copolymer sponge with outer glycolide and ε-caprolactone copolymer monofilament reinforcement, was implanted into the inferior vena cava (IVC) of 13 canines. All the animals remained alive without any major complications until euthanasia. The utility of the iTEV was evaluated from 1 to 24 months postoperatively. The elastic modulus of the iTEV determined by an intravascular ultrasound imaging system was about 90% of the native IVC after 1 month. Angiography of the iTEV after 2 years showed a well-formed vasculature without marked stenosis or thrombosis with a mean pressure gradient of 0.51 ± 0.19 mmHg. The length of the iTEV at 2 years had increased by 0.48 ± 0.15 cm compared with the length of the original scaffold (2-3 cm). Histological examinations revealed a well-formed vessel-like vasculature without calcification. Biochemical analyses showed no significant differences in the hydroxyproline, elastin, and calcium contents compared with the native IVC. We concluded that the findings shown above provide direct evidence that the new scaffold can be useful for cell-free tissue-engineering of vasculature. The long-term results revealed that the iTEV was of good quality and had adapted its shape to the needs of the living body. Therefore, this scaffold would be applicable for pediatric cardiovascular surgery involving biocompatible materials."
https://openalex.org/W1994735427,"Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is an effective anti-cancer drug, but its clinical usage is limited by a dose-dependent cardiotoxicity characterized by widespread sarcomere disarray and loss of myofilaments. Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP, ANKRD1) is a transcriptional regulatory protein that is extremely susceptible to doxorubicin; however, the mechanism(s) of doxorubicin-induced CARP depletion and its specific role in cardiomyocytes have not been completely defined. We report that doxorubicin treatment in cardiomyocytes resulted in inhibition of CARP transcription, depletion of CARP protein levels, inhibition of myofilament gene transcription, and marked sarcomere disarray. Knockdown of CARP with small interfering RNA (siRNA) similarly inhibited myofilament gene transcription and disrupted cardiomyocyte sarcomere structure. Adenoviral overexpression of CARP, however, was unable to rescue the doxorubicin-induced sarcomere disarray phenotype. Doxorubicin also induced depletion of the cardiac transcription factor GATA4 in cardiomyocytes. CARP expression is regulated in part by GATA4, prompting us to examine the relationship between GATA4 and CARP in cardiomyocytes. We show in co-transfection experiments that GATA4 operates upstream of CARP by activating the proximal CARP promoter. GATA4-siRNA knockdown in cardiomyocytes inhibited CARP expression and myofilament gene transcription, and induced extensive sarcomere disarray. Adenoviral overexpression of GATA4 (AdV-GATA4) in cardiomyocytes prior to doxorubicin exposure maintained GATA4 levels, modestly restored CARP levels, and attenuated sarcomere disarray. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated depletion of CARP completely abolished the Adv-GATA4 rescue of the doxorubicin-induced sarcomere phenotype. These data demonstrate co-dependent roles for GATA4 and CARP in regulating sarcomere gene expression and maintaining sarcomeric organization in cardiomyocytes in culture. The data further suggests that concurrent depletion of GATA4 and CARP in cardiomyocytes by doxorubicin contributes in large part to myofibrillar disarray and the overall pathophysiology of anthracycline cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W1974144264,"Escherichia coli has homologues of the competence genes other species use for DNA uptake and processing, but natural competence and transformation have never been detected. Although we previously showed that these genes are induced by the competence regulator Sxy as in other gamma-proteobacteria, no conditions are known that naturally induce sxy expression. We have now tested whether the competence gene homologues encode a functional DNA uptake machinery and whether DNA uptake leads to recombination, by investigating the effects of plasmid-borne sxy expression on natural competence in a wide variety of E. coli strains. High- and low-level sxy expression alone did not induce transformation in any of the strains tested, despite varying the transforming DNA, its concentration, and the incubation conditions used. Direct measurements of uptake of radiolabelled DNA were below the limit of detection, however transformants were readily detected when recombination functions were provided by the lambda Red recombinase. This is the first demonstration that E. coli sxy expression can induce natural DNA uptake and that E. coli's competence genes do encode a functional uptake machinery. However, the amount of transformation cells undergo is limited both by low levels of DNA uptake and by inefficient DNA processing/recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2035490264,"Immunotherapy with high-dose interleukin-2 (HDIL-2) is an effective treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. However, it is accompanied by severe toxicity involving endothelial cell injury and induction of vascular leak syndrome (VLS). In this study, we found that resveratrol, a plant polyphenol with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties, was able to prevent the endothelial cell injury and inhibit the development of VLS while improving the efficacy of HDIL-2 therapy in the killing of metastasized melanoma. Specifically, C57BL/6 mice were injected with B16F10 cells followed by resveratrol by gavage the next day and continued treatment with resveratrol once a day. On day 9, mice received HDIL-2. On day 12, mice were evaluated for VLS and tumor metastasis. We found that resveratrol significantly inhibited the development of VLS in lung and liver by protecting endothelial cell integrity and preventing endothelial cells from undergoing apoptosis. The metastasis and growth of the tumor in lung were significantly inhibited by HDIL-2 and HDIL-2 + resveratrol treatment. Notably, HDIL-2 + resveratrol co-treatment was more effective in inhibiting tumor metastasis and growth than HDIL-2 treatment alone. We also analyzed the immune status of Gr-1+CD11b+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and FoxP3+CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg). We found that resveratrol induced expansion and suppressive function of MDSC which inhibited the development of VLS after adoptive transfer. However, resveratrol suppressed the HDIL-2-induced expansion of Treg cells. We also found that resveratrol enhanced the susceptibility of melanoma to the cytotoxicity of IL-2-activated killer cells, and induced the expression of the tumor suppressor gene FoxO1. Our results suggested the potential use of resveratrol in HDIL-2 treatment against melanoma. We also demonstrated, for the first time, that MDSC is the dominant suppressor cell than regulatory T cell in the development of VLS."
https://openalex.org/W1993046320,"Provider-initiated testing and counselling (PITC) is a priority strategy for increasing access for HIV-exposed children to prevention measures, and infected children to treatment and care interventions. This article examines efforts to scale-up paediatric PITC at a second-level hospital located in Zambia's Southern Province, and serving a catchment area of 1.2 million people.Our retrospective case study examined best practices and enabling factors for rapid institutionalization of PITC in Livingstone General Hospital. Methods included clinical observations, key informant interviews with programme management, and a desk review of hospital management information systems (HMIS) uptake data following the introduction of PITC. After PITC roll-out, the hospital experienced considerably higher testing uptake. In a 36-month period following PITC institutionalization, of total inpatient children eligible for PITC (n = 5074), 98.5% of children were counselled, and 98.2% were tested. Of children tested (n = 4983), 15.5% were determined HIV-infected; 77.6% of these results were determined by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing in children under the age of 18 months. Of children identified as HIV-infected in the hospital's inpatient and outpatient departments (n = 1342), 99.3% were enrolled in HIV care, including initiation on co-trimoxazole prophylaxis. A number of good operational practices and enabling factors in the Livingstone General Hospital experience can inform rapid PITC institutionalization for inpatient and outpatient children. These include the placement of full-time nurse counsellors at key areas of paediatric intake, who interface with patients immediately and conduct testing and counselling. They are reinforced through task-shifting to peer counsellors in the wards. Nurse counsellor capacity to draw specimen for DNA PCR for children under 18 months has significantly enhanced early infant diagnosis. The hospital's bolstered antiretroviral supply chain, package of on-site HIV services, and follow-up care for children and families improved the continuum of service uptake.The clinical impact and operational experience emphasizes that institutional PITC is a feasible strategy for increasing access to paediatric HIV care, particularly in generalized epidemic settings."
https://openalex.org/W2067084320,"The use of top predators as bio-platforms is a modern approach to understanding how physical changes in the environment may influence their foraging success. This study examined if the presence of thermoclines could be a reliable signal of resource availability for a marine top predator, the little penguin (Eudyptula minor). We studied weekly foraging activity of 43 breeding individual penguins equipped with accelerometers. These loggers also recorded water temperature, which we used to detect changes in thermal characteristics of their foraging zone over 5 weeks during the penguin's guard phase. Data showed the thermocline was detected in the first 3 weeks of the study, which coincided with higher foraging efficiency. When a thermocline was not detected in the last two weeks, foraging efficiency decreased as well. We suggest that thermoclines can represent temporary markers of enhanced food availability for this top-predator to which they must optimally adjust their breeding cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1972140706,"Thioredoxins (Trxs) are important regulators of photosynthetic fixation of CO(2) and nitrogen in plant chloroplasts. To date, they have been considered to play a minor role in controlling the Calvin cycle in marine diatoms, aquatic primary producers, although diatoms possess a set of plastidic Trxs. In this study we examined the influences of the redox state and the involvement of Trxs in the enzymatic activities of pyrenoidal carbonic anhydrases, PtCA1 and PtCA2, in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. The recombinant mature PtCA1 and -2 (mPtCA1 and -2) were completely inactivated following oxidation by 50 μm CuCl(2), whereas DTT activated CAs in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximum activity of mPtCAs in the presence of 6 mm reduced DTT increased significantly by addition of 10 μm Trxs from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtTrx-f2 and -m2) and 5 μm Trxs from P. tricornutum (PtTrxF and -M). Analyses of mPtCA activation by Trxs in the presence of DTT revealed that the maximum mPtCA1 activity was enhanced ∼3-fold in the presence of Trx, whereas mPtCA2 was only weakly activated by Trxs, and that PtTrxs activate PtCAs more efficiently compared with AtTrxs. Site-directed mutagenesis of potential disulfide-forming cysteines in mPtCA1 and mPtCA2 resulted in a lack of oxidative inactivation of both mPtCAs. These results reveal the first direct evidence of a target of plastidic Trxs in diatoms, indicating that Trxs may participate in the redox control of inorganic carbon flow in the pyrenoid, a focal point of the CO(2)-concentrating mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1996321741,"Although an increased expression level of XIAP is associated with cancer cell metastasis, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unexplored. To verify the specific structural basis of XIAP for regulation of cancer cell migration, we introduced different XIAP domains into XIAP(-/-) HCT116 cells, and found that reconstitutive expression of full length HA-XIAP and HA-XIAP ΔBIR, both of which have intact RING domain, restored β-Actin expression, actin polymerization and cancer cell motility. Whereas introduction of HA-XIAP ΔRING or H467A mutant, which abolished its E3 ligase function, did not show obvious restoration, demonstrating that E3 ligase activity of XIAP RING domain played a crucial role of XIAP in regulation of cancer cell motility. Moreover, RING domain rather than BIR domain was required for interaction with RhoGDI independent on its E3 ligase activity. To sum up, our present studies found that role of XIAP in regulating cellular motility was uncoupled from its caspase-inhibitory properties, but related to physical interaction between RhoGDI and its RING domain. Although E3 ligase activity of RING domain contributed to cell migration, it was not involved in RhoGDI binding nor its ubiquitinational modification."
https://openalex.org/W2133270411,"We present here the x-ray structures of the progesterone receptor (PR) in complex with two mixed profile PR modulators whose functional activity results from two differing molecular mechanisms. The structure of Asoprisnil bound to the agonist state of PR demonstrates the contribution of the ligand to increasing stability of the agonist conformation of helix-12 via a specific hydrogen-bond network including Glu723. This interaction is absent when the full antagonist, RU486, binds to PR. Combined with a previously reported structure of Asoprisnil bound to the antagonist state of the receptor, this structure extends our understanding of the complex molecular interactions underlying the mixed agonist/antagonist profile of the compound. In addition, we present the structure of PR in its agonist conformation bound to the mixed profile compound Org3H whose reduced antagonistic activity and increased agonistic activity compared with reference antagonists is due to an induced fit around Trp755, resulting in a decreased steric clash with Met909 but inducing a new internal clash with Val912 in helix-12. This structure also explains the previously published observation that 16α attachments to RU486 analogs induce mixed profiles by altering the binding of 11β substituents. Together these structures further our understanding of the steric and electrostatic factors that contribute to the function of steroid receptor modulators, providing valuable insight for future compound design.

https://openalex.org/W1992507332,"The organic solute transporter, Ost/Slc51, is composed of two distinct proteins that must heterodimerize to generate transport activity, but the role of the individual subunits in mediating transport activity is unknown. The present study identified regions in Ostβ required for heterodimerization with Ostα, trafficking of the Ostα-Ostβ complex to the plasma membrane, and bile acid transport activity in HEK293 cells. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis revealed that a 25-amino acid peptide containing the Ostβ transmembrane (TM) domain heterodimerized with Ostα, although the resulting complex failed to reach the plasma membrane and generate cellular [3H]taurocholate transport activity. Deletion of the single TM domain of Ostβ abolished interaction with Ostα, demonstrating that the TM segment is necessary and sufficient for formation of a heteromeric complex with Ostα. Mutation of the highly conserved tryptophan-asparagine sequence within the TM domain of Ostβ to alanines did not prevent cell surface trafficking, but abolished transport activity. Removal of the N-terminal 27 amino acids of Ostβ resulted in a transporter complex that reached the plasma membrane and exhibited transport activity at 30 °C. Complete deletion of the C terminus of Ostβ abolished [3H]taurocholate transport activity, but reinsertion of two native arginines immediately C-terminal to the TM domain rescued this defect. These positively charged residues establish the correct Nexo/Ccyt topology of the peptide, in accordance with the positive inside rule.

The overall structure of Ostα-Ostβ resembles that of certain G protein-coupled receptors, including the G protein-coupled receptor-receptor activity-modifying protein (GPCR-RAMP) complexes. Ostβ, a 128-amino acid protein in humans and mice, is predicted to contain a single transmembrane (TM) domain, and to be oriented in the plasma membrane with its N terminus in the extracellular space and its C terminus in the cytosol (Nexo/Ccyt with no signal peptide, classified as a type Ia integral membrane protein) (5Li N.

Interestingly, although skate Ostβ and human OSTβ display roughly 25% amino acid identity, previous studies have shown that human OSTα can generate comparable taurocholate transport activity when complemented with either human OSTβ or skate Ostβ, suggesting that only a few conserved amino acids or the secondary structure of the OSTβ/Ostβ proteins is important for interaction (4Seward D.J. Koh A.S. Boyer J.L. Ballatori N. Functional complementation between a novel mammalian polygenic transport complex and an evolutionarily ancient organic solute transporter, Ostα-Ostβ.J. Biol.

The goal of this work was to identify regions of Ostβ that are critical for dimerization with Ostα, trafficking, and transport activity. The three main amino acid segments of Ostβ were analyzed: (i) C-terminal residues 54–107; (ii) N-terminal residues 1–27; and (iii) the TM domain region. In addition, point mutants of evolutionarily conserved residues in Ostβ were constructed and characterized. HEK293 cells (ATCC, CRL-1573) were grown as monolayers at 37 °C, unless otherwise indicated, in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were maintained in DMEM (GIBCO) containing 10% FBS and antibiotics. [3H]Taurocholic acid (2 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Ostα, Ostβ, and the truncations of Ostβ were amplified via PCR using primers shown in supplemental Table S1 and inserted into pcDNA3.3 (Invitrogen). Ostβ-Δ34–53, the Ostβ point mutants, Ostβ-1–55, and Ostβ-1–55 R54A/R55A were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange (Stratagene). All constructs were sequenced for accuracy. HEK293 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 900 ng of Ostα and 100 ng of each Ostβ species DNA using LipoD293 (SignaGen). Twelve h later, the medium was replaced, and cells were incubated at 30 °C or 37 °C for an additional 36 h. At 48 h after transfection, medium was replaced with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Invitrogen) containing 25 μm [3H]taurocholic acid, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold HBSS containing 1 mm unlabeled taurocholate and 0.2% (w/v) BSA and then once with ice-cold HBSS alone. Monolayers were lysed overnight in 1 n NaOH, and an aliquot of the transport media and the lysate was analyzed by liquid scintillation to assess transport activity. Lysate protein concentrations were determined with the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), and nonspecific cell-associated radioactivity was accounted for by subtracting radioactivity detected at time zero.

Ostα-YN in pBiFCN and Ostβ-YC in pBiFCC were described previously (5Li N. Cui Z. Fang F. Lee J.Y. Ballatori N.

J. 2007; 407: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Truncations of Ostβ were PCR-amplified and ligated into pBiFCC. Constructs in pBiFCN/pBiFCC were then subcloned into pcDNA3.3. BiFC-tagged Ostβ point mutants were produced via site-directed mutagenesis. Cerulean (from Dr. David Piston, Vanderbilt University) was PCR-amplified and ligated 3′ to Ostα. The two halves of YFP in pBiFCN and pBiFCC were combined 3′ to Ostβ, generating Ostβ-YFP. Two rounds of mutagenesis were conducted to change the YFP coding sequence to Topaz (16Tsien R.Y. The green fluorescent protein.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4926) Google Scholar). The Topaz coding sequence was then PCR-amplified and ligated 3′ to Ostβ mutants. Stop codons in the linkers were changed to alanine codons via site-directed mutagenesis. For visualization, HEK293 cells on glass-bottom Petri dishes (Mat-Tek) were transfected with 900 ng of Ostα-YN/Cerulean and 100 ng of each Ostβ species-YC/Topaz DNA. Twelve h later, the medium was replaced, and cells were incubated at 30 °C (BiFC) or 37 °C (Cerulean/Topaz) for 36 h. At 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in HBSS containing 2 μg/ml wheat germ agglutinin-Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate, 2 μm Hoechst 33342, and 2 μm ER-Tracker Red (all from Molecular Probes). Cells were then washed and visualized in imaging buffer (136 mm NaCl, 560 μm MgCl2, 4.7 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm HEPES, 5.5 mm glucose, and 1.3 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) with an FV1000 Olympus laser scanning confocal microscope using a 60×objective. Imaging was conducted with virtual channels in two phases: (i) Hoechst 33342 (405 nm excitation, 425/456 nm emission), ER-Tracker Red (559 nm, 575/620 nm), and wheat germ agglutinin 647 (635 nm, 655/755 nm); and (ii) Cerulean (440 nm, 472/497 nm) and YFP/Topaz (515 nm, 530/585 nm). Sequential scanning was used for both phases, and saturation was controlled through the FV1000 software. The N termini of Ostα and Ostβ were tagged with V5 and triple HA (3×HA) epitopes, respectively, via site-directed mutagenesis. HEK293 cells were transfected with 900 ng of V5-Ostα and 100 ng of each 3×HA-Ostβ species DNA in 24-well plates. At 48 h after transfection, cell surface ELISA was conducted as described previously (17Gehret A.U. Jones B.W. Tran P.N. Cook L.B. Greuber E.K. Hinkle P.M.

Briefly, plates were incubated with monoclonal anti-V5 (Invitrogen) and anti-HA (Covance) at 1:5,000 followed by anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Bio-Rad) at 1:5,000. Antibody binding was detected with 3,3′5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, and the reaction was terminated with 10% sulfuric acid. Absorbance was read at 450 nm, and values from duplicate points were averaged. Absorbance in mock-transfected cells was subtracted, and the resulting values were normalized to those obtained in V5-Ostα-3×HA-Ostβ-transfected cells, which were present on each plate. At 48 h after transfection, HEK293 cells were lysed with PBS containing 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm PMSF, and 0.2% Triton X-100. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was taken as the whole cell lysate and immediately frozen at −80 °C. Lysate protein concentrations were determined with the DC protein assay. For immunoblotting of V5-Ostα, 15 μg of each sample was subjected to Laemmli-SDS-PAGE on 10% Tris-HCl ready gels (Bio-Rad) followed by wet transfer onto PVDF using Dunn carbonate buffer (10 mm NaHCO3, 3 mm Na2CO3, pH 9.9, 20% methanol) for 90 min at 100 volts. Blots were blocked in milk at room temperature for 3 h and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-V5 at 1:10,000. Anti-mouse IgG-HRP (KPL) at 1:5,000 was then applied for 1 h at room temperature. For immunoblotting of 3×HA-Ostβ mutants, 15 μg of each sample was subjected to Tricine-SDS-PAGE on 10–20% or 16.5% Tris-Tricine precast gels (Bio-Rad) followed by wet transfer using Towbin buffer (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with anti-HA HRP conjugate (Roche Applied Science) at 25 milliunits/ml for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody binding was detected with LumiGLO Peroxidase Chemiluminescent Substrate (KPL). For loading controls, blots were probed with anti-α-tubulin or anti-β-actin (Sigma). Glycosylation tags (N*N*) were added to the N termini of constructs via mutagenic PCR. The glycosylation tag is a segment of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-factor receptor Ste2p with the amino acid sequence STINYTSIYGNGSTITSSS, which contains two Asn residues that are known to be N-glycosylated when luminal in the ER (18Harley C.A.

HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with 900 ng of V5-Ostα and 100 ng of each N*N*-3×HA-Ostβ species DNA, and whole cell lysates were collected 48 h later. Protein samples were processed with the Glycoprofile II, Enzymatic In-Solution N-Deglycosylation kit (Sigma) and subjected to SDS-PAGE for band shift analysis. All bar graphs show the mean ± S.E. from three or four independent experiments, each performed in duplicate or triplicate. Data were evaluated with Prism 4 using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test, or the two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE program (multiple sequence comparison by log-expectation). To identify regions of Ostβ that are important for function, five truncation mutants were constructed (Fig. 1A). These Ostβ truncations were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells with Ostα, and [3H]taurocholate transport activity was measured (Fig. 1B). To correlate functional and visualization results with the BiFC-tagged proteins, cells were incubated at either 30 or 37 °C before transport activity was measured (see below). As expected, cells co-expressing wild-type Ostα and Ostβ demonstrated robust taurocholate uptake (Fig. 1B). Deletion of the 21 C-terminal residues of Ostβ, generating Ostβ-1–107, did not affect transport activity; however, complete truncation of the C terminus, yielding Ostβ-1–53, markedly decreased taurocholate uptake (Fig. 1B). Deletion of the N terminus of Ostβ, producing Ostβ-28–128, resulted in a heteromeric transporter complex that elicited transport activity, but only if cells were incubated at 30 °C. Transport activity of the wild-type heteromer was also slightly higher if cells were incubated at 30 °C (Fig. 1B). Culturing at low temperatures is known to increase protein production (19Kaufmann H.

No transport activity was detected when Ostα was expressed with mutants of Ostβ that contained only the TM domain region (Ostβ-29–53) or lacked the entire TM domain (Ostβ-Δ34–53) (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the loss of transport activity observed with these Ostβ mutants was due to failure of the resulting transporter complex to traffic to the plasma membrane, Ostα and the truncated Ostβs were tagged at the N termini with V5 and triple HA (3×HA) epitopes, respectively, and the amounts of these proteins at the cell surface were determined (Fig. 1C). The tagged proteins gave taurocholate transport activity comparable with, although somewhat lower than, their untagged counterparts (compare Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1), as observed previously (5Li N. Cui Z. Fang F. Lee J.Y. Ballatori N. Heterodimerization, trafficking and membrane topology of the two proteins, Ostα and Ostβ, that constitute the organic solute and steroid transporter.Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As expected, neither 3×HA-Ostβ nor V5-Ostα was found at the cell surface when expressed alone. When expressed with V5-Ostα, the Ostβ constructs that displayed transport activity (3×HA-Ostβ, 3×HA-Ostβ-1–107, and 3×HA-Ostβ-28–128) were readily detected at the plasma membrane along with the V5-Ostα subunit, although 3×HA-Ostβ-28–128 was present at half the level of the full-length protein even though V5-Ostα was detected in normal amounts (Fig. 1C). One possible explanation for this result is that the 3×HA tag on 3×HA-Ostβ-28–128 is closer to the TM domain of Ostβ and may be partially occluded in the resulting V5-Ostα-3×HA-Ostβ-28–128 heteromer. The Ostβ constructs that did not give transport activity (3×HA-Ostβ-1–53, 3×HA-Ostβ-29–53, and 3×HA-Ostβ-Δ34–53) were not localized at the plasma membrane, nor was co-expressed V5-Ostα (Fig. 1C), explaining the absence of functional activity. The Ostβ constructs that were detected at the plasma membrane (3×HA-Ostβ, 3×HA-Ostβ-1–107, and 3×HA-Ostβ-28–128) gave strong bands on immunoblots when expressed with V5-Ostα (Fig. 1D). V5-Ostα was also present at high levels and appeared fully glycosylated, indicating that it had been post-translationally modified in the Golgi apparatus upon interaction with the Ostβ constructs. In contrast, 3×HA-Ostβ-1–53, which was not detectable on the cell surface, was visible on immunoblots; however, in this pairing V5-Ostα was largely absent and not fully glycosylated (Fig. 1D). Neither 3×HA-Ostβ-29–53 nor 3×HA-Ostβ-Δ34–53 was detected on immunoblots (Fig. 1D), suggesting that these mutants are unstable. To observe the interaction between Ostα and Ostβ and its subcellular localization simultaneously in live cells, BiFC analysis was conducted using confocal microscopy. The N-terminal half of YFP (YN) was fused to the C terminus of Ostα and the C-terminal half of YFP (YC) to the C terminus of each Ostβ species. If Ostα and Ostβ interact directly, the two halves of the fluorophore form YFP. The BiFC constructs exhibited taurocholate transport activity roughly comparable with that of the untagged constructs (compare Figs. 1B and 2A). One interesting exception was Ostβ-1–53-YC, which showed significant transport activity upon co-expression with Ostα-YN (Fig. 2A), whereas their untagged counterparts did not (Fig. 1B). Ostβ-YC, Ostβ-1–107-YC, and Ostβ-28–128-YC showed clear YFP fluorescence at the plasma membrane, indicating that they heterodimerized with Ostα-YN and trafficked to the cell surface (Fig. 2B). These findings are consistent with surface expression measurements described above. In contrast with the behavior of the epitope-tagged proteins, Ostβ-1–53-YC and Ostα-YN heterodimerized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B), consistent with the transport activity generated by this complex (Fig. 2A). Ostβ-29–53-YC (TM domain region of Ostβ only) and Ostα-YN formed a BiFC complex that was retained in the ER (Fig. 2B), in accord with the lack of detectable complex on the cell surface (Fig. 1C). The Ostβ complex lacking the TM region (Ostβ-Δ34–53-YC) did not interact with Ostα-YN (Fig. 2B), in agreement with surface expression and immunoblotting data (Fig. 1, B and D). These findings suggest that the TM domain of Ostβ is sufficient for interaction with Ostα but not for trafficking. To ensure that these findings did not result from the affinity of the YFP fragments for one another, the fluorophores Cerulean and Topaz, which exhibit no affinity for each other, were fused to the C termini of Ostα and the Ostβ truncations, respectively. The Topaz fusions of Ostβ, Ostβ-1–107, Ostβ-1–53, and Ostβ-28–128 all co-localized with Ostα-Cerulean at the plasma membrane (supplemental Fig. S2), in agreement with the BiFC results (Fig. 2B). Ostβ-29–53-Topaz (TM domain region only) and Ostβ-Δ34–53-Topaz (no TM domain) were detected in cells (supplemental Fig. S2), whereas the 3×HA-tagged versions were not (Fig. 1D). This is not surprising because GFP and its variants tend to increase the stability of proteins (26Bokman S.H. Ward W.W. Renaturation of Aequorea green fluorescent protein.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

https://openalex.org/W1974448526,"Our large brain, long life span and high fertility are key elements of human evolutionary success and are often thought to have evolved in interplay with tool use, carnivory and hunting. However, the specific impact of carnivory on human evolution, life history and development remains controversial. Here we show in quantitative terms that dietary profile is a key factor influencing time to weaning across a wide taxonomic range of mammals, including humans. In a model encompassing a total of 67 species and genera from 12 mammalian orders, adult brain mass and two dichotomous variables reflecting species differences regarding limb biomechanics and dietary profile, accounted for 75.5%, 10.3% and 3.4% of variance in time to weaning, respectively, together capturing 89.2% of total variance. Crucially, carnivory predicted the time point of early weaning in humans with remarkable precision, yielding a prediction error of less than 5% with a sample of forty-six human natural fertility societies as reference. Hence, carnivory appears to provide both a necessary and sufficient explanation as to why humans wean so much earlier than the great apes. While early weaning is regarded as essentially differentiating the genus Homo from the great apes, its timing seems to be determined by the same limited set of factors in humans as in mammals in general, despite some 90 million years of evolution. Our analysis emphasizes the high degree of similarity of relative time scales in mammalian development and life history across 67 genera from 12 mammalian orders and shows that the impact of carnivory on time to weaning in humans is quantifiable, and critical. Since early weaning yields shorter interbirth intervals and higher rates of reproduction, with profound effects on population dynamics, our findings highlight the emergence of carnivory as a process fundamentally determining human evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2075772547,"Brain regions involved with processing dynamic visuomotor representational transformation are investigated using fMRI. The perceptual-motor task involved flying (or observing) a plane through a simulated Red Bull Air Race course in first person and third person chase perspective. The third person perspective is akin to remote operation of a vehicle. The ability for humans to remotely operate vehicles likely has its roots in neural processes related to imitation in which visuomotor transformation is necessary to interpret the action goals in an egocentric manner suitable for execution. In this experiment for 3(rd) person perspective the visuomotor transformation is dynamically changing in accordance to the orientation of the plane. It was predicted that 3(rd) person remote flying, over 1(st), would utilize brain regions composing the 'Mirror Neuron' system that is thought to be intimately involved with imitation for both execution and observation tasks. Consistent with this prediction differential brain activity was present for 3(rd) person over 1(st) person perspectives for both execution and observation tasks in left ventral premotor cortex, right dorsal premotor cortex, and inferior parietal lobule bilaterally (Mirror Neuron System) (Behaviorally: 1(st)>3(rd)). These regions additionally showed greater activity for flying (execution) over watching (observation) conditions. Even though visual and motor aspects of the tasks were controlled for, differential activity was also found in brain regions involved with tool use, motion perception, and body perspective including left cerebellum, temporo-occipital regions, lateral occipital cortex, medial temporal region, and extrastriate body area. This experiment successfully demonstrates that a complex perceptual motor real-world task can be utilized to investigate visuomotor processing. This approach (Aviation Cerebral Experimental Sciences ACES) focusing on direct application to lab and field is in contrast to standard methodology in which tasks and conditions are reduced to their simplest forms that are remote from daily life experience."
https://openalex.org/W2041221216,"In humans, three soluble extracellular cobalamin-binding proteins; transcobalamin (TC), intrinsic factor (IF), and haptocorrin (HC), are involved in the uptake and transport of cobalamin. In this study, we investigate a cobalamin-binding protein from zebrafish (Danio rerio) and summarize current knowledge concerning the phylogenetic evolution of kindred proteins. We identified a cobalamin binding capacity in zebrafish protein extracts (8.2 pmol/fish) and ambient water (13.5 pmol/fish) associated with a single protein. The protein showed resistance toward degradation by trypsin and chymotrypsin (like human IF, but unlike human HC and TC). The cobalamin analogue, cobinamide, bound weaker to the zebrafish cobalamin binder than to human HC, but stronger than to human TC and IF. Affinity for another analogue, adenosyl-pseudo-cobalamin was low compared with human HC and TC, but high compared with human IF. The absorbance spectrum of the purified protein in complex with hydroxo-cobalamin resembled those of human HC and IF, but not TC. We searched available databases to further explore the phylogenies of the three cobalamin-binding proteins in higher vertebrates. Apparently, TC-like proteins are the oldest evolutionary derivatives followed by IF and HC (the latter being present only in reptiles and most but not all mammals). Our findings suggest that the only cobalamin-binding protein in zebrafish is an intermediate between the three human cobalamin binders. These findings support the hypothesis about a common ancestral gene for all cobalamin-binding proteins in higher vertebrates."

Studies using knock-out mice suggest that β3-adrenoceptor (β3-AR) signaling is dependent on caveolin-1; however, it is not known whether caveolin-1 is associated with the β3-AR or solely with downstream signaling proteins. We have addressed this question by examining the impact of membrane rafts and caveolin-1 on the differential signaling of mouse β3a- and β3b-AR isoforms that diverge at the distal C terminus. Only the β3b-AR promotes pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive cAMP accumulation. When cells expressing the β3a-AR were treated with filipin III to disrupt membrane rafts or transfected with caveolin-1 siRNA, the cyclic AMP response to the β3-AR agonist CL316243 became PTX-sensitive, suggesting Gαi/o coupling.

https://openalex.org/W2118052242,"The obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasites, e.g. Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium species, induce an IFNγ-driven induction of host indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of tryptophan catabolism in the kynurenine pathway. Induction of IDO1 supposedly depletes cellular levels of tryptophan in host cells, which is proposed to inhibit the in vitro growth of auxotrophic pathogens. In vivo function of IDO during infections, however, is not clear, let alone controversial. We show that Eimeria falciformis, an apicomplexan parasite infecting the mouse caecum, induces IDO1 in the epithelial cells of the organ, and the enzyme expression coincides with the parasite development. The absence or inhibition of IDO1/2 and of two downstream enzymes in infected animals is detrimental to the Eimeria growth.

Other enzymes of the pathway include kynurenine aminotransferase and kynurenine 3-hydroxylase (supplemental Fig. S1A). Over the last three decades, the tryptophan catabolism has gained an increasing attention because the ensuing depletion of the essential amino acid and the accumulation of downstream products can influence multiple and disparate biological processes such as antimicrobial effect, immunosuppression, cellular transformation, and neuromodulation (1Taylor M.W.

IDO1 was first reported to play a defensive role against the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, supposedly by depleting intracellular tryptophan in IFNγ-treated host cells (7Pfefferkorn E.R.

Together these reports postulated IDO1 contributing to the host defense by depleting the subcellular tryptophan available to susceptible microbes. In addition, IDO1 is believed to be an important immunoregulatory enzyme. The biochemical inhibition of IDO in pregnant mice causes rejection of the developing fetus, indicating the importance of this enzyme in pregnancy-associated immunotolerance (13Munn D.H. Zhou M.

Besides, blocking of IDO exerted no apparent effect on the mouse immune response in a toxoplasmosis model, whereas an increase in IFNγ and a decrease in IL-10 level were observed in Leishmania-infected animals (18Divanovic S. Sawtell N.M. Trompette A. Warning J.I. Dias A. Cooper A.M. Yap G.S. Arditi M. Shimada K. Duhadaway J.B. Prendergast G.C. Basaraba R.J. Mellor A.L. Munn D.H. Aliberti J. Karp C.L. Opposing biological functions of tryptophan catabolizing enzymes during intracellular infection.J. Infect. Dis. 2012; 205: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is thus debatable whether an induced expression of IDO is required for the host resistance against the pathogens and/or for antiproliferative effects to counteract an escalated immune response. Eimeria species belong to the apicomplexan phylum, which comprises obligate intracellular parasites such as Toxoplasma and Plasmodium. Individual Eimeria species infect an exclusive tissue and host cell type and complete their life cycle within a single organism, offering a particular advantage for in vivo and site-specific parasite-host interactions. This study uses Eimeria falciformis, a murine parasite, and demonstrates a previously unanticipated subversion of the host IDO1 and tryptophan catabolism by this parasite. The IDO1 knock-out mice (Balb/c strain) were a kind donation by Muriel Moser (Institut de Biologie et de Médecine Moléculaires, Université Libre de Bruxelles). The parental control Balb/c and NMRI mice were purchased from the Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany). Animal procedures were performed according to the German Animal Protection Laws as directed and approved by the overseeing authority Landesamt fuer Gesundheit und Soziales (Berlin, Germany). E. falciformis oocysts were procured from Bayer. The natural life cycle of E. falciformis was maintained by continuous passages of the parasite oocysts in female NMRI mice. Oocysts in the animal feces were washed in water, sterilized and floated with NaOCl, and quantified using a McMaster counting chamber (19Stockdale P.G. Stockdale M.J. Rickard M.D. Mitchell G.F. Mouse strain variation and effects of oocyst dose in infection of mice with Eimeria falciformis, a coccidian parasite of the large intestine.Int. J. Parasitol. 1985; 15: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The purified oocysts were stored in potassium dichromate at 4 °C and for the experiments were used within 3 months of collection. The 8–12-week-old animals were orally infected with 100 μl of PBS containing the indicated amount of oocysts. Infected mice were kept on grids in separate cages, and oocyst yield was evaluated by collecting feces on a daily basis. Individual fecal samples were dissolved in water and diluted in saturated sodium chloride for counting. All of the animals were weighed every day to monitor their weight loss during the course of infection. The female NMRI animals infected with 1500 oocysts were sacrificed on day 1 to day 8 during infection, and their caeca were collected. The parasitized caecal tissues were fixed with 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and 2.0% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 100 mm cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 4 h at room temperature and for an additional 12 h at 4 °C. Tissues were rinsed with 100 mm cacodylate buffer three times for 15 min and postfixed for 4 h with 2% (v/v) osmium tetroxide and 3% (w/v) potassium hexacyanoferrate (II) on ice. The samples were rinsed once with 100 mm cacodylate buffer for 30 min and then washed with 5 mm maleate buffer three times for 15 min. Tissue samples were stained en bloc with 0.5% (w/v) uranyl acetate, washed again with 5 mm maleate buffer (three times for 15 min), dehydrated in an increasing series of ethanol and propylene oxide, and embedded in Spurr resin. Thin sectioning was performed with a Reichert Ultra Cut, and sections (70–90 nm) were counterstained with 4% (w/v) uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate. All of the samples were imaged on a transmission electron microscope equipped with a wide angle CCD camera (Zeiss EM 900; TRS Systems, Moorenweis, Germany). The caeca of infected or uninfected female Balb/c mice were removed, carefully washed, and stored in 4% PFA/PBS for immunohistochemical staining. The tissues embedded in paraffin were cut into 2-μm sections. The samples were treated with xylene, rehydrated in descending ethanol concentrations, and then washed with water. Antigen retrieval was achieved by boiling in citric buffer solution (pH 6.0) in a pressure cooker. The slides were rinsed in water and washed with TBS, and the primary antibody (rat anti-mouse clone mIDO-48; Biolegend) was added (1:200, 30 min). After washing, the sections were incubated with the secondary antibody (biotinylated rabbit anti-rat, 1:200, 30 min, Dako). Streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase solution was applied (30 min) onto the sections, which were visualized by Fast RED (Dako). The slides were rinsed in water and then counterstained with hematoxylin. The images were acquired using a LEICA DMIL microscope and LEICA DFC 480 camera and processed with LEICA Application Suite (v2.8.1). Immunoblot analysis of tissue homogenates was performed using polyclonal rabbit anti-IDO and rabbit anti-β-tubulin primary antibodies (Genscript) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (GE Healthcare). The caeca of uninfected or infected female NMRI mice were removed, washed, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total proteins were prepared in a lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm PMSF, and protease-inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). The samples were homogenized and centrifuged (5 min, 4 °C, 12000 rpm), and the protein amount in the supernatant was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). 30 μg of total tissue protein was separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Applichem). Unspecific binding was blocked by overnight incubation in 5% skim milk powder in TBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 (TBS-T). The primary antibody (1:1000) was applied in blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature, followed by three washes in TBS-T and addition of the secondary antibody (1:3000, 45 min at room temperature). The samples were subjected to three washes in TBS-T, and the protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). The same blots were used to monitor anti-β-tubulin expression (protein loading) using the immunoblot recycling kit (Alpha Diagnostic). Protein expression was quantified by densitometric method using Adobe Photoshop suite. Infected or uninfected caeca were isolated, washed in calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution, opened longitudinally, and cut into 5 mm pieces. To isolate epithelial cells, the tissues were transferred into tubes and incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution and DTT (1 mm) for 30 min and 37 °C with gentle shaking. The supernatants were discarded. The samples were suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution and EDTA (1 mm), and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with vigorous shaking every 10 min. Subsequent supernatants were passed through a 70-μm cell strainer (BD Bioscience) into fresh tubes and centrifuged (1500 rpm, 5 min). The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was isolated using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen). 100 ng of RNA was either reverse transcribed into first strand cDNA (SuperScript III first strand synthesis SuperMix for quantitative RT-PCR; Invitrogen) for standard PCR (1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, 1 μm primers, 1.25 units of GoTaq DNA polymerase) or subjected to quantitative real time PCR (SuperScript III Platinum SYBR Green One-Step quantitative RT-PCR kit with ROX) (primers in supplemental Table S1). Primers for the mouse 18 S rRNA (Mm18S-F/R) and IDO1 transcript (MmIDO1-F/R) were designed based on the NCBI accession numbers NR_003278 and NM_008324.1, respectively. The E. falciformis 18 S rRNA (Ef18S-F/R) primers were designed using the entry AF080614.1, and the gametocyte-specific primers (EfGam56-F/R and EfGam82-F/R) were based on the ongoing genome-sequencing project (kindly made available by Simone Spork (Humboldt University, Berlin) and Christoph Dieterich (Max-Delbrück Center, Berlin)). Purified oocysts were digested with 0.4% pepsin (pH 3, 37 °C, 1 h; Sigma-Aldrich). The oocyst pellet was mixed with 0.5-mm glass beads (Sartorius) in a 1:1 ratio, and briefly vortexed to release free sporocysts. To excyst the sporozoites, DMEM containing 0.25% trypsin, 0.75% sodium tauroglycocholate, glutamine (20 mm), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml) was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C up to 2 h. The free sporozoites were column-purified by DE-52 anion exchange chromatography (20Schmatz D.M. Crane M.S. Murray P.K. Purification of Eimeria sporozoites by DE-52 anion exchange chromatography.J. Protozool. 1984; 31: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and adjusted to 2 × 106 parasites/ml in DMEM. The parasite antigen was prepared by three freeze-thaw cycles and stored at −80 °C. To perform cell proliferation and IFNγ assays, spleens and intestinal mesenteric lymph nodes were extracted, and single cell suspension was prepared by passaging the tissue through a 70-μm strainer. Cell number was adjusted to 3.5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%), l-glutamine (20 mm), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). 3.5 × 105 cells were incubated in the presence of sporozoite antigen (equivalent to 1.17 × 105 parasites/well) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 48 h. Supernatants were collected for IFNγ detection, and the cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/well of methyl-[3H]thymidine (GE Healthcare) for 20 h at 37 °C. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The IFNγ levels in the supernatants were measured using the mouse ELISA Ready-SET-Go kit (eBioscience). (S)-4-(Ethylsulfonyl) benzoylalanine hydrochloride (Enzo Life Sciences) inhibits kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT-II) (21Pellicciari R. Rizzo R.C. Costantino G. Marinozzi M. Amori L. Guidetti P. Wu H.Q. Schwarcz R. Modulators of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. Synthesis and preliminary biological evaluation of (S)-4-(ethylsulfonyl)benzoylalanine, a potent and selective kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II) inhibitor.Chem. Med. Chem. 2006; 1: 528-531Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and Ro61-8048 (Tocris Bioscience) is a competitive inhibitor of kynurenine 3-hydroxylase (22Röver S. Cesura A.M. Huguenin P. Kettler R. Szente A. Synthesis and biochemical evaluation of N-(4-phenylthiazol-2-yl)benzenesulfonamides as high-affinity inhibitors of kynurenine 3-hydroxylase.J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 4378-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). 100 mm stock solutions in PBS were prepared for both inhibitors. The animals infected with E. falciformis were treated once daily with 1 mm of Ro61-8048 or (S)-4-(ethylsulfonyl) benzoylalanine diluted in PBS. Inhibitors were applied via oral tube. To inhibit indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, the mice were given 1-methyl-dl-tryptophan (5 mg/ml of l-1-MT and 2 mg/ml of d-1-MT; Sigma Aldrich) in drinking water supplemented with artificial sweetener, which was changed every 2 days. All of the treatments started 2 days prior to infection and continued until the end of the experiments. All of the graphs represent the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments with five or six individual mice unless specified otherwise. The two-tailed nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used for determination of the statistical significance. The p values below 0.05 were considered as significant. We first examined a nonlethal natural infection of the inbred and outbred mice via oral inoculation of the purified oocysts of E. falciformis. The NMRI mice were infected with increasing numbers of oocysts (10–500), and the kinetics of oocyst shedding into animal feces was determined. Irrespective of the inoculums, the first batch of oocyst was detectable on day 7 of infection that continued until day 12, indicating a stringently synchronized development of the parasite (Fig. 1A). The total oocyst output increased at higher doses and correlated with increments in infection inoculums (Fig. 1B). The animals receiving 10 oocysts discharged a total of 1.7 × 106, and a 10-fold higher dose yielded a 3-fold increase in the oocysts (5.3 × 106). A further increment of the initial dose to 500 oocysts resulted in yet another nonlinear enhancement in the oocyst yield (7.5 × 106), indicating a saturated infection (Fig. 1B). Compared with the outbred NMRI animals, the inbred Balb/c strain receiving equivalent inoculums yielded a similar kinetics of oocyst shedding (supplemental Fig. S2A). Both strains produced their first batch of oocysts on day 7, and the peak days were not influenced at low and high doses (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S2A), confirming identical prepatent and patent periods regardless of the animal breeding or inoculums. The parasitized animals were weighed every day to assess the infection-associated pathology, deduced by loss in their body weight (supplemental Fig. S2, B and C). Infection at all doses resulted in a modest reduction of weight from day 7 to day 10 of infection in two strains, which was subsequently followed by a recovery on day 11 and onwards. Neither NMRI (supplemental Fig. S2B) nor Balb/c (supplemental Fig. S2C) infected with 10 oocysts showed a loss of more than 6% of the weight when compared with day 5. Interestingly, a considerably higher dose of 500 oocysts was well tolerated, and animals did not lose more than 10–15% of their body weight. In brief, these results reveal that E. falciformis completes its natural life cycle in a 1-week period, irrespective of the inoculums or strains. These data confirmed the suitability of both mouse strains for further assays using considerably variable inoculums of E. falciformis. We next performed transmission electron microscopy to investigate in vivo progression of E. falciformis in NMRI mice (Fig. 1C). The animals were infected with a dose of 1500 oocysts for an easier identification of the parasitized sections in infected caeca. As summarized below, E. falciformis exhibited asexual and sexual stages within the 1 week of its life cycle. Infection on days 3 and 4 revealed immature and mature schizonts in the parasitized epithelial cells of the caecum, which indicated the progression of asexual development (Fig. 1C, day 3 and day 4). The nuclei within the immature schizonts on day 6 represent developing merozoites, which were released following the host cell rupture and detectable in axenic or intracellular form (Fig. 1C, day 5). Imaging of early development was not feasible in infected sections collected on days 1 and 2. The onset of parasite growth, however, was quite evident on these days as deduced by 18 S ribosomal RNA (Fig. 1D). The ratio of host and parasite RNA increased over 7 days and then declined on day 8, indicating a constant increase in parasite burden followed by completion of its life cycle (supplemental Fig. S1B). An immature macrogamont and a mature macrogamont with a central nucleus and wall forming bodies were observed on days 7 and 8, which marked the initiation and succession of sexual development (Fig. 1C, day 7 and day 8). Fig. 1C (day 8) shows a microgamont with microgametes adjacent to a macrogamont. The transition to sexual phase on day 6 was confirmed by detection of EfGam56 and EfGam82 transcripts identified between days 6 and 8 (Fig. 1D). The homologs of EfGam56 and EfGam82 proteins are expressed in a macrogamont-specific manner in the avian species of Eimeria (23Belli S.I. Ferguson D.J. Katrib M. Slapetova I. Mai K. Slapeta J. Flowers S.A. Miska K.B. Tomley F.M. Shirley M.W. Wallach M.G. Smith N.C. Conservation of proteins involved in oocyst wall formation in Eimeria maximaEimeria tenellaEimeria acervulina.Int. J. Parasitol. 2009; 39: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Taken together, we show the entire natural development of E. falciformis in mouse, which consists of distinct asexual and sexual stages in the epithelial cells of host caecum. To examine the expression of IDO1 during in vivo development of E. falciformis, the naïve control and parasite-infected mice were sacrificed, and samples were isolated for quantitative PCR (Fig. 2A) and Western blot (Fig. 2B). Compared with uninfected control, the IDO1 transcript was up-regulated by 64-fold on the first day of infection, and amplified by more than 250-fold on day 3. The relative amount of IDO1 mRNA increased further up to 400-fold on day 5 and subsequently decreased to about 230-fold during the late infection (day 7). In accord with quantitative PCR, immunoblot analysis of uninfected and infected caeca revealed a similar outcome (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, IDO1 protein as a 46-kDa band was first detectable on day 2 of infection, which then persisted throughout the parasite life cycle. The observed lag in protein expression suggests a post-transcriptional regulation of IDO1. The enzyme expression reached a maximum on day 5 and then declined until day 7, as quantified by immunoblot performed on samples from three independent in vivo infections (Fig. 2C). In brief, we show that E. falciformis infection of mouse results in the induced expression of host IDO1 in the parasitized caecum. To precisely determine the site of IDO expression within the parasitized host tissue, the caeca of control and infected animals were subjected to immunohistochemical staining. As expected from Fig. 2B, no IDO staining of the naïve tissue was observed. Also, neither epithelial nor cells of the lamina propria appeared stained for IDO protein up to 24 h of infection (Fig. 2D). In contrast, a strong expression of IDO was evident in caecal epithelial cells on days 6 and 8 of infection. An apparent reduction in IDO expression on day 8 (Fig. 2D) corresponds to the protein quantification (Fig. 2C) and is likely a consequence of host cell lysis by the parasite. Collectively, we demonstrate a strong and selective induction of IDO in the epithelial cells of mouse caecum in response to infection with E. falciformis. Induced expression of IDO exerts an antimicrobial effect on susceptible pathogens, likely by depleting the subcellular tryptophan (24Carlin J.M. Ozaki Y. Byrne G.I. Brown R.R. Borden E.C. Interferons and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. Role in antimicrobial and antitumor effects.Experientia. 1989; 45: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To examine the significance of IDO for in vivo development of E. falciformis, we infected the IDO1−/− (Balb/c) mice and evaluated the entire parasite development as indicated by oocyst formation (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, deficiency of IDO reduced the oocyst yield to nearly half of the control group. Whereas the parental mice produced a total of 6.7 × 106 oocysts, the IDO1−/− group shed only 4 × 106 oocysts corresponding to a significant reduction (p < 0.0001) of 2.7 × 106 oocysts in transgenic animals (Fig. 3A). The kinetics of oocyst shedding remained unaltered in the IDO1−/− group (Fig. 3B), and the decline in yield was confined to the peak days of infection (day 8, p < 0.001; days 9 and 10, p < 0.0001). The growth of E. falciformis was not completely abolished in the absence of IDO1 that might be attributed to the presence of IDO2. This prompted us to inhibit the total IDO activity using a specific and competitive inhibitor (1-MT) (Fig. 3C). Inhibition of enzyme activity by 1-MT treatment of the NMRI mice via the drinking water reduced the oocysts yield to 35% (p < 0.0001) compared with the untreated control. An equivalent phenotype with 55% fewer oocysts (p < 0.001) was obtained when using the Balb/c strain. The prepatent and patent per"

Fas ligand (FasL, CD95L, CD178) 2The abbreviations used are: FasLFas ligandHGFhepatocyte growth factorMβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrin. is a 40-kDa type II transmembrane protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family.

In addition to initiating the Fas signal, FasL can also transmit a costimulatory signal in the reverse direction. For instance, whereas CD4+ T cells show reduced cell cycle progression and undergo apoptosis upon Fas/FasL engagement, CD8+ T cells require the reverse signal of FasL for rapid proliferation and maturation (6Suzuki I.

Upon T cell activation, FasL is recruited into lipid rafts where the serine residue on the casein kinase I motif is phosphorylated. The proline-rich domain of FasL binds to Src homology 3 domain-containing proteins, such as Fyn, Grb2, and PI3K, and subsequently enhances the phosphorylation of Akt, Erk1/2, and JNK (12Sun M.

At the moment, the signal of FasL in tumor cells correlated with the malignant transformation is still undecided. Regarding the escape of Fas/FasL-mediated cytotocixity, the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor (Met) has been reported to sequester Fas and thus inhibits Fas activation and apoptosis in hepatocytes (19Wang X. DeFrances M.C. Dai Y. Pediaditakis P. Johnson C. Bell A. Michalopoulos G.K. Zarnegar R. A mechanism of cell survival. Sequestration of Fas by the HGF receptor Met.Mol.

Unexpectedly, we found that Met and FasL were co-immunoprecipitated by monoclonal anti-FasL antibody G247-4. Met is a tyrosine kinase receptor expressed by embryo cells, hepatocytes, and cancer cells (20Lai A.Z. Abella J.V. Park M.

For example, Met associates with CD44 upon HGF stimulation, leading to MEK and ERK activation and interacts with integrins in the presence or absence of ligand (24Wang R. Kobayashi R. Bishop J.M.

Given the importance of the Met pathway in tumor metastasis, we hypothesized that Met contributes to FasL-associated tumor malignancy. In this study, we provide evidence to show that FasL interacts with Met to activate the Met signaling pathway. A human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549), a human hepatoma cell line (PLC/PRF/5), and a human glioma cell line (U118MG) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts, kindly provided by Dr. M. D. Lai (National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan), were cultured in high-glucose DMEM. FasL was detected either with monoclonal antibody G247-4, recognizing the C-terminal of FasL (BD Biosciences, Pharmingen) or with polyclonal antibody N-20, recognizing the N-terminal of FasL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, San Diego, CA). ZB4 (Santa Cruz), a Fas-neutralizing antibody, was used to block the Fas signal. Met was inhibited by PHA665752 (Tocris Cookson, Bristol, UK). Stat3 was inhibited by AG490 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). FasL(117–126) short peptides, stsqmhtass, were synthesized by MDBio, Taipei, Taiwan. The cDNA clones for human full-length FasL and Fas were obtained from Open Biosystems (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL). Truncated human FasL was generated from a full-length FasL cDNA clone by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using various primer sets (Table 1), subcloned into EGFP-N1 vector, and confirmed by DNA sequencing (MB Mission Biotech, Taipei, Taiwan).TABLE 1The primer sets for FasL truncationConstructsPrimer setsOligonucleotide sequences (5′-3′)FasLΔ33 (31Jodo S.

To produce lentivirus, 15 μg of the transfer plasmid, 9 μg of the package plasmid (psPAX2), and 6 μg of the envelope plasmid (pMD2.G) were cotransfected into 293T cells by the calcium phosphate method. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were cultured in 15 ml of fresh serum-free medium for another 48 h. The culture medium with virions was then collected, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 90 min. For transduction, tumor cells or NIH3T3 cells were infected for 16 h with 10 μl of virus suspension containing 8 μg/ml of Polybrene (Sigma). Total extracted proteins were heat-denatured with sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, separated in 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. After being blocked with 5% skim milk, the membrane was probed with the primary antibody for targeted proteins followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Targeted proteins were made visible by fluorography using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Millipore, Bedford, MA). For immunoprecipitation, 0.5–2 mg of protein lysates were precleared with protein G-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and then incubated with FasL-specific antibody and protein G-agarose beads. In the short peptides blocking experiment, transfectants of the cells were treated with short peptides at the indicated concentrations for 2 h. Immunocomplex binding on the beads was eluted and subjected to Western blot analysis for FasL and Met. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Equal amounts of lysates were brought to 600 μl with 40% OptiPrep (Sigma) and covered with 2,400 μl of 30% OptiPrep and 600 μl of 5% OptiPrep. Protein lysates were ultracentrifuged at 485,000 × g for 20 h to separate the lipid rafts. 600 μl of each fraction were collected for further analysis. A six-well culture plate was coated with 2 ml of medium containing 0.5% Noble-agarose. After the preloaded medium was gelled at room temperature, 5 × 103 cells suspended in 400 μl of medium containing 0.5% Noble-agarose and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were then added. Cell colonies were counted after 2 weeks of culture. About 2 × 105 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and grown to confluence. A wound on the cell monolayer was created by scraping. After the scraped cells were washed away, fresh medium was added. The migration of cells into the denuded areas was monitored at the time described. For invasion assessment, Matrigel containing laminin, collagen IV, and heparin sulfate proteoglycans were thawed on ice and diluted to 1 mg/ml with cold serum-free medium. The membrane filter of the upper chamber of a transwell was coated with 50 μl of the diluted Matrigel and incubated at 37 °C for gelling. About 2 × 105 cells suspended in 200 μl of serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were added to a well of a 12-well transmigration plate. The lower chamber was loaded with 600 μl of medium containing 10% FBS as the nutritional attractant. After 16 h of incubation, the invading cells attached to the underside of the membrane filter were stained with Giemsa and counted. About 5 × 104 cells were seeded in a 40-mm culture dish and incubated for 6 h to allow cell attachment. Cell migration was captured every 5 min for up to 6 h using a time-lapse microscope system and Image-Pro ExpressTM (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). Cell motility was tracked and measured by ImageJ software (NIH). Proliferating cells were excluded from analysis. Cells grown on coverslips for 24 h were incubated with cholera toxin subunit B-Alexa Fluor 647 (CTxB-Alexa Fluor 647, Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) to stain lipid rafts for 20 min on ice, washed with PBS, and then fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 prepared in PBS and probed with monoclonal anti-FasL antibody G247-4 (BD Biosciences, Pharmingen) and anti-Met (Santa Cruz) antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After being washed with PBS, the cells were further probed with the appropriate Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 dye. Images were taken using a FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Colocalization of Met, FasL, and lipid raft was analyzed using FV10-ASW software (Olympus). Eight-week-old BALB/cAnN.Cg-Foxn1nu/CrlNarl nude mice were obtained from the National Laboratory Animal Breeding and Research Center, Tainan, Taiwan, and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. All animal experiments were carried out with the approval of the Ethics Committee of the Animal Research Center, National Cheng Kung University. Mice received 5 × 105 cells suspended in 0.1 ml of PBS via tail vein injection. Tumor nodules in the lungs of inoculated mice were counted under a dissecting microscope. The lungs, kidneys, liver, and spleen were removed from tumor-bearing mice, fixed in 10% buffered formalin, and then embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (5 μm) were placed on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Tumor tissues were captured by a dotSlide-digital virtual microscope system (Olympus). Transfectant cells were detached from culture plate with 10 mm EDTA solution, then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde solution. These cells were stained with anti-FasL antibody (G247-4) for 60 min at room temperature followed by anti-mouse IgG-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 for another 60 min. The fluorescence intensity was recorded by flow cytometry, and analyzed by WinMDI software. Membrane proteins were prepared by the centrifugal protein extraction method. Transfectant cells were homogenized by sonication in a buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, and a protease inhibitor mixture. The homogenate was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 170,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was dissolved in KCl buffer and centrifuged again at 170,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was solubilized in a sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol for Western blotting analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used, with p < 0.05 considered as significant. A549, PLC/PRF/5, and U118 cells expressed various amounts of FasL and the expressions, both at transcriptional and translational levels, were significantly inhibited by a lentivirus carrying shRNA against FasL (Fig. 1, A and B). Along with knockdown of FasL, the migration ability of transfectants was reduced by 20–70% (Fig. 1C). Notably, the phosphorylation of Met in A549, PLC/PRF/5, and U118 cells was also reduced (Fig. 1B). We further pulled down FasL protein by the monoclonal antibody (G247-4), recognizing its extracellular domain, and unexpectedly found that the Met protein was co-immunoprecipitated with FasL (Fig. 1D). FasL has been shown to transduce a reverse signal in CD8+ T lymphocytes by recruiting effector proteins to its cytoplasmic domain (6Suzuki I. Fink P.J. Maximal proliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes requires reverse signaling through Fas ligand.J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 12Sun M. Ames K.T. Suzuki I. Fink P.J. The cytoplasmic domain of Fas ligand costimulates TCR signals.J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1481-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We wondered whether a similar signaling mechanism is used by FasL in tumor cells. To explore possible binding proteins for the FasL cytoplasmic domain, we constructed truncated versions of human FasL, called Δ70 and Δ33 (Fig. 2A). The expression level of full-length FasL in NIH3T3 cells was low, probably due to a degradation process, as reported in a previous study (27Xiao S. Deshmukh U.S. Jodo S. Koike T. Sharma R. Furusaki A. Sung S.S. Ju S.T. Novel negative regulator of expression in Fas ligand (CD178) cytoplasmic tail. Evidence for translational regulation and against Fas ligand retention in secretory lysosomes.J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5095-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although high levels of Δ70 and Δ33 variants were detected in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2B), they did not bring about the endoplasmic reticulum stress-response protein, Bip. Cell-surface FasL expression was detected on those transfectants by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 2C). In addition, the growth rate and viability of NIH3T3 cells were not affected by FasL variants, regardless of the length of their intracellular domain (Fig. 2, D and E). In the wound healing assay (Fig. 2F), transfectants of full-length FasL and Δ33 showed about 85% healing in 10 h. The Δ70 transfectant reached about 60% healing in 10 h, which is slower than full-length FasL and Δ33, but still faster than the control cells (45% healing). Similar to a previous report (28Barnhart B.C. Legembre P. Pietras E. Bubici C. Franzoso G. Peter M.E. CD95 ligand induces motility and invasiveness of apoptosis-resistant tumor cells.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), overexpression of Fas in NIH3T3 cells elevated the wound healing capacity to 60% healing in 10 h. To exclude the potential of the Fas signal being activated by the ectopic expression of FasL, we used the blocking antibody ZB4 to prevent interaction of Fas and FasL. The ZB4 antibody effectively reverted the wound healing capacity of the Fas transfectant from 60 to 45%. However, the elevated wound healing ability of the FasL transfectants was not affected by the ZB4 antibody, indicating a Fas-independent pathway in our study system. We further measured the motility of individual cells by time-lapse videomicroscopy (Fig. 2G). Control NIH3T3 cells moved about 100 μm in 6 h. Transfectants of Fas, full-length FasL, Δ70, and Δ33 moved significantly further (170–250 μm). In addition, treatment with ZB4-neutralized antibody effectively blocked the Fas-enhanced motility, but not the FasL-mediated migration. Similarly, transfectants of full-length FasL, Δ70, and Δ33 showed a higher cell invasion degree in Matrigel than did the control group (Fig. 2H). We have also measured MMP2 and MMP9, but their expressions did not change in cells with different levels of FasL (data not shown). Collectively, these results reveal that FasL increases the metastatic potential in the absence of a cytoplasmic domain (e.g. Δ70). This finding goes against the conventional receptor-mediated signaling concept, in which a cytoplasmic protein domain is required for adaptor protein recruitment. As mentioned earlier, while searching for FasL-binding proteins, we found that Met was co-immunoprecipitated with FasL (Fig. 1D). Colocalization of FasL and Met was observed in confocal microscopy images (Fig. 3A). FasL, with or without intracellular domains, not only appeared on the surface membrane but also showed a punctate pattern in the cytoplasm. In control NIH3T3 cells, about 30% of Met was localized in lipid rafts (Fig. 3B, ML/L). Ectopic expression of FasL did not significantly change the distribution of Met. In addition, 30–50% of the total Met was colocalized with FasL (Fig. 3B, MF/M). To verify the interaction of FasL and Met, we investigated their cellular distribution. By fractionation in the density gradient, FasL, full-length or truncated, was present both in lipid rafts (fraction 3) and nonraft regions (fractions 5 and 6). Caveolin-1, a lipid raft marker, was detected only in fraction 3. In agreement with confocal microscopy images, overexpression of FasL variants did not alter the distribution of Met. However, the Met in lipid rafts became highly phosphorylated (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, we pulled down the FasL of transfectants by immunoprecipitation. The amount of Met protein detected in the precipitates was positively correlated with FasL (Fig. 3D). To determine whether lipid rafts are required for the formation of FasL-Met complexes, we extracted cholesterol from the plasma membranes with MβCD to disrupt the integrity of the rafts (29Härtel S. Diehl H.A. Ojeda F. Methyl-beta-cyclodextrins and liposomes as water-soluble carriers for cholesterol incorporation into membranes and its evaluation by a microenzymatic fluorescence assay and membrane fluidity-sensitive dyes.Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Treatment with 10 μm MβCD for 1 h had no effect on the expression of Met and FasL, but severely reduced the formation of complexes (Fig. 3D). The Met-Stat3 signal axis is essential for the invasive behavior of many tumors (22Cramer A. Kleiner S. Westermann M. Meissner A. Lange A. Friedrich K.

Hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIFα) is the well-known substrate of pVHL. Besides HIFα, pVHL also binds to many other proteins and has multiple functions. In this manuscript, we report that the nuclear clusterin (nCLU) is a target of pVHL. We found that pVHL had a direct interaction with nCLU. nCLU bound to pVHL at pVHL's β domain, the site for recognition of substrate, indicating that nCLU might be a substrate of pVHL. Interestingly, pVHL bound to nCLU but did not lead to nCLU destruction. Further studies indicated that pVHL mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of nCLU and promoted nCLU nuclear translocation. In summary, our results disclose a novel function of pVHL that mediates K63-linked ubiquitination and identify nCLU as a new target of pVHL."

https://openalex.org/W2062203028,"A novel function for the binder of Arl two (BART) molecule in pancreatic cancer cells is reported. BART inhibits invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells through binding to a Ca(2+)-dependent, phosphorylated, guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) membrane fusion protein, annexin7 (ANX7). A tumor suppressor function for ANX7 was previously reported based on its prognostic role in human cancers and the cancer-prone mouse phenotype ANX7(+/-). Further investigation demonstrated that the BART-ANX7 complex is transported toward cell protrusions in migrating cells when BART supports the binding of ANX7 to the protein kinase C (PKC) isoform PKCα. Recent evidence has suggested that phosphorylation of ANX7 by PKC significantly potentiates ANX7-induced fusion of phospholipid vesicles; however, the current data suggest that the BART-ANX7 complex reduces PKCα activity. Knocking down endogenous BART and ANX7 increases activity of PKCα, and specific inhibitors of PKCα significantly abrogate invasiveness induced by BART and ANX7 knockdown. These results imply that BART contributes to regulating PKCα activity through binding to ANX7, thereby affecting the invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells. Thus, it is possible that BART and ANX7 can distinctly regulate the downstream signaling of PKCα that is potentially relevant to cell invasion by acting as anti-invasive molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2083921927,"Background The treatment of chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is still charged of significant risk of hematoma recurrence. Patient-related predictors and the surgical procedures themselves have been addressed in many studies. In contrast, postoperative management has infrequently been subjected to detailed analysis. Moreover variable intravenous fluid administration (IFA) was not reported in literature till now in the context of cSDH treatment. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 45 patients with cSDH were operated in our department via two burr hole craniostomy within one calendar year. Downward drainage was routinely left in hematoma cavity for a one day. Independent variables selected for the analysis were related to various aspects of patient management, including IFA. Two dependent variables were chosen as measure of clinical course: the rate of hematoma recurrence (RHR) and neurological status at discharge from hospital expressed in points of Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed. Hematoma recurrence with subsequent evacuation occurred in 7 (15%) patients. Univariate regression analysis revealed that length of IFA after surgery influenced both dependent variables: RHR (p = 0.045) and GOS (p = 0.023). Multivariate regression performed by backward elimination method confirmed that IFA is a sole independent factor influencing RHR. Post hoc dichotomous division of patients revealed that those receiving at least 2000 ml/day over 3 day period revealed lower RHR than the group with less intensive IFA. (p = 0.031). Conclusions/Significance IFA has been found to be a sole factor influencing both: RHR and GOS. Based on those results we may recommend administration of at least 2000 ml per 3 days post-operatively to decrease the risk of hematoma recurrence."

https://openalex.org/W2020299722,"Transcription of the ascorbate transporter, SVCT2, is driven by two distinct promoters in exon 1 of the transporter sequence. The exon 1a promoter lacks a classical transcription start site and little is known about regulation of promoter activity in the transcription start site core (TSSC) region. Here we present evidence that the TSSC binds the multifunctional initiator-binding protein YY1. Electrophoresis shift assays using YY1 antibody showed that YY1 is present as one of two major complexes that specifically bind to the TSSC. The other complex contains the transcription factor NF-Y. Mutations in the TSSC that decreased YY1 binding also impaired the exon 1a promoter activity despite the presence of an upstream activating NF-Y/USF complex, suggesting that YY1 is involved in the regulation of the exon 1a transcription. Furthermore, YY1 interaction with NF-Y and/or USF synergistically enhanced the exon 1a promoter activity in transient transfections and co-activator p300 enhanced their synergistic activation. We propose that the TSSC plays a vital role in the exon 1a transcription and that this function is partially carried out by the transcription factor YY1. Moreover, co-activator p300 might be able to synergistically enhance the TSSC function via a ""bridge"" mechanism with upstream sequences."

https://openalex.org/W2019319681,"Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) are a subset of CD4+ T-cells that have been found to suppress the immune response. During HIV viral infection, Treg activity has been observed to have both beneficial and deleterious effects on patient recovery; however, the extent to which this is regulated is poorly understood. We hypothesize that this dichotomy in behavior is attributed to Treg dynamics changing over the course of infection through the proliferation of an ‘adaptive’ Treg population which targets HIV-specific immune responses. To investigate the role Tregs play in HIV infection, a delay differatial equation model was constructed to examine (1) the possible existence of two distinct Treg populations, normal (nTregs) and adaptive (aTregs), and (2) their respective effects in limiting viral load. Sensitivity analysis was performed to test parameter regimes that show the proportionality of viral load with adaptive regulatory populations and also gave insight into the importance of downregulation of CD4+ cells by normal Tregs on viral loads. Through the inclusion of Treg populations in the model, a diverse array of viral dynamics was found. Specifically, oscillatory and steady state behaviors were both witnessed and it was seen that the model provided a more accurate depiction of the effector cell population as compared with previous models. Through further studies of adaptive and normal Tregs, improved treatments for HIV can be constructed for patients and the viral mechanisms of infection can be further elucidated."

This study characterizes intracellular trafficking of two FXYD family members, FXYD1 (phospholemman (PLM)) and FXYD7. Surface expression of PLM in Xenopus oocytes requires coexpression with the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase. On the other hand, the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, another PLM-interacting protein could not drive it to the cell surface. The Na(+)/K(+) ATPase-dependent surface expression of PLM could be facilitated by either a phosphorylation-mimicking mutation at Thr-69 or a truncation of three terminal arginine residues. Unlike PLM, FXYD7 could translocate to the cell surface of Xenopus oocytes independently of the coexpression of α1β1 Na(+)/K(+) ATPase. The Na(+)/K(+) ATPase-independent membrane translocation of FXYD7 requires O-glycosylation of at least two of three conserved threonines in its ectodomain.

The intention is to reduce complications and associated costs, while improving the quality of care by mandating VTE prophylaxis. We applied a system dynamics model to estimate the impact of HACS on VTE rates, and potential unintended consequences such as increased rates of bleeding and infection and decreased access for patients who might benefit from TKA.The system dynamics model uses a series of patient stocks including the number needing TKA, deemed ineligible, receiving TKA, and harmed due to surgical complication. The flow of patients between stocks is determined by a series of causal elements such as rates of exclusion, surgery and complications. The number of patients harmed due to VTE, bleeding or exclusion were modeled by year by comparing patient stocks that results in scenarios with and without HACS. The percentage of TKA patients experiencing VTE decreased approximately 3-fold with HACS. This decrease in VTE was offset by an increased rate of bleeding and infection. Moreover, results from the model suggest HACS could exclude 1.5% or half a million patients who might benefit from knee replacement through 2020.System dynamics modeling indicates HACS will have the intended consequence of reducing VTE rates. However, an unintended consequence of the policy might be increased potential harm resulting from over administration of prophylaxis, as well as exclusion of a large population of patients who might benefit from TKA."
https://openalex.org/W2120205640,"The glycine receptor (GlyR) exists either in homomeric α or heteromeric αβ forms. Its agonists bind at extracellular subunit interfaces. Unlike subunit interfaces from the homomeric α GlyR, subunit interfaces from the heteromeric αβ GlyR have not been characterized unambiguously because of the existence of multiple types of interface within single receptors. Here, we report that, by reconstituting β+/α- interfaces in a homomeric GlyR (αChb+a- GlyR), we were able to functionally characterize the αβ GlyR β+/α- interfaces. We found that the β+/α- interface had a higher agonist sensitivity than that of the α+/α- interface. This high sensitivity was contributed primarily by loop A. We also found that the β+/α- interface differentially modulates the agonist properties of glycine and taurine. Using voltage clamp fluorometry, we found that the conformational changes induced by glycine binding to the β+/α- interface were different from those induced by glycine binding to the α+/α- interface in the α GlyR. Moreover, the distinct conformational changes found at the β+/α- interface in the αChb+a- GlyR were also found in the heteromeric αβ GlyR, which suggests that the αChb+a- GlyR reconstitutes structural components and recapitulates functional properties, of the β+/α- interface in the heteromeric αβ GlyR. Our investigation not only provides structural and functional information about the GlyR β+/α- interface, which could direct GlyR β+/α- interface-specific drug design, but also provides a general methodology for unambiguously characterizing properties of specific protein interfaces from heteromeric proteins."
