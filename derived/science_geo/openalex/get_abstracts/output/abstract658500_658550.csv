https://openalex.org/W3081367520,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of depression and anxiety among Bangladeshi university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also aimed at identifying the determinants of depression and anxiety. A total of 476 university students living in Bangladesh participated in this cross-sectional web-based survey. A standardized e-questionnaire was generated using the Google Form, and the link was shared through social media—Facebook. The information was analyzed in three consecutive levels, such as univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. Students were experiencing heightened depression and anxiety. Around 15% of the students reportedly had moderately severe depression, whereas 18.1% were severely suffering from anxiety. The binary logistic regression suggests that older students have greater depression (OR = 2.886, 95% CI = 0.961–8.669). It is also evident that students who provided private tuition in the pre-pandemic period had depression (OR = 1.199, 95% CI = 0.736–1.952). It is expected that both the government and universities could work together to fix the academic delays and financial problems to reduce depression and anxiety among university students."
https://openalex.org/W3080746647,"Perception of biotic and abiotic stresses often leads to stomatal closure in plants1,2. Rapid influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) across the plasma membrane has an important role in this response, but the identity of the Ca2+ channels involved has remained elusive3,4. Here we report that the Arabidopsis thaliana Ca2+-permeable channel OSCA1.3 controls stomatal closure during immune signalling. OSCA1.3 is rapidly phosphorylated upon perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Biochemical and quantitative phosphoproteomics analyses reveal that the immune receptor-associated cytosolic kinase BIK1 interacts with and phosphorylates the N-terminal cytosolic loop of OSCA1.3 within minutes of treatment with the peptidic PAMP flg22, which is derived from bacterial flagellin. Genetic and electrophysiological data reveal that OSCA1.3 is permeable to Ca2+, and that BIK1-mediated phosphorylation on its N terminus increases this channel activity. Notably, OSCA1.3 and its phosphorylation by BIK1 are critical for stomatal closure during immune signalling, and OSCA1.3 does not regulate stomatal closure upon perception of abscisic acid—a plant hormone associated with abiotic stresses. This study thus identifies a plant Ca2+ channel and its activation mechanisms underlying stomatal closure during immune signalling, and suggests specificity in Ca2+ influx mechanisms in response to different stresses. A study in Arabidopsis thaliana shows that the immune receptor-associated cytosolic kinase BIK1 phosphorylates OSCA1.3 and identifies OSCA1.3 as the pathogen-responsive Ca2+-permeable channel that regulates stomatal closure."

Spatial compartmentation was first proposed over 30 years ago to explain how diverse G protein-coupled receptors achieve specificity despite converging on a ubiquitous messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). However, the mechanisms responsible for spatially constraining this diffusible messenger remain elusive. Here, we reveal that the type I regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), RIα, undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) as a function of cAMP signaling to form biomolecular condensates enriched in cAMP and PKA activity, critical for effective cAMP compartmentation. We further show that a PKA fusion oncoprotein associated with an atypical liver cancer potently blocks RIα LLPS and induces aberrant cAMP signaling. Loss of RIα LLPS in normal cells increases cell proliferation and induces cell transformation. Our work reveals LLPS as a principal organizer of signaling compartments and highlights the pathological consequences of dysregulating this activity architecture.

Our work reveals LLPS as a principal organizer of signaling compartments and highlights the pathological consequences of dysregulating this activity architecture. 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a universal regulator of cellular function and behavior across evolution. In eukaryotes, cAMP production is canonically triggered in response to hormone signaling via G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated activation of transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (ACs), which catalyze synthesis of cAMP from ATP. cAMP signals are transduced by a number of well-studied effector proteins, most prominently cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), a tetrameric holoenzyme consisting of a regulatory subunit dimer bound to a pair of catalytic subunits. Binding of cAMP to the PKA regulatory subunit unleashes the activity of the PKA catalytic subunit (PKAcat), which then phosphorylates a myriad of targets throughout the cell. Together, cAMP and PKA exert tight control over numerous physiological processes, from cell growth and survival (Gottesman and Fleischmann, 1986Gottesman M.M. Fleischmann R.D.

However, this long-standing model of PDE-controlled cAMP compartmentation is at odds with reports describing almost unrestricted (e.g., 270–780 μm2/s) cAMP diffusion in cells (Bacskai et al., 1993Bacskai B.J.

Notably, more recent investigations have reported significantly lower cytosolic cAMP diffusion rates that are more conducive for cAMP compartmentalization than the original estimates (Agarwal et al., 2016Agarwal S.R.

Res. 2016; 110: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the specific mechanisms responsible for spatially constraining this critical second messenger remain to be elucidated. Here we identify the formation of biomolecular condensates of the type I regulatory subunit of PKA, RIα, as a key driver of cAMP compartmentation. RIα undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) at endogenous levels as a function of dynamic cAMP signaling to form RIα bodies harboring high levels of cAMP and PKA activity, and this dynamic cAMP sequestration is required to spatially constrain cAMP in cells. Importantly, RIα LLPS is explicitly disrupted by a PKAcat fusion oncoprotein present in the atypical liver cancer fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) (Honeyman et al., 2014Honeyman J.N. Simon E.P. Robine N. Chiaroni-Clarke R. Darcy D.G. Lim I.I.P. Gleason C.E. Murphy J.M. Rosenberg B.R. Teegan L. et al.Detection of a recurrent DNAJB1-PRKACA chimeric transcript in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma.Science. 2014; 343: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), leading to aberrant cAMP signaling and cell transformation. Our work reveals LLPS as an essential coordinator of signaling compartments and provides critical mechanistic clues into the etiology of FLC, highlighting the pathological consequences of dysregulated signaling activity architecture. Of the four non-redundant PKA regulatory subunits, only RIα is ubiquitously expressed, and it is essential for proper regulation of PKA activity (Cadd and McKnight, 1989Cadd G. McKnight G.S. Distinct patterns of cAMP-dependent protein kinase gene expression in mouse brain.Neuron. 1989; 3: 71-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To visualize the dynamics of RIα expressed at endogenous levels, we introduced the 11th β strand of GFP (FP11) (Leonetti et al., 2016Leonetti M.D. Sekine S. Kamiyama D. Weissman J.S. Huang B. A scalable strategy for high-throughput GFP tagging of endogenous human proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: E3501-E3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) at the C terminus of RIα via CRISPR-Cas9 in HEK293A cells, yielding the 293-RIα cell line. This small segment permits efficient knockin and enables targeted reconstitution of intact GFP when the remainder of superfolder GFP (GFP1–10) is co-expressed. By doing so in 293-RIα cells, we observed fluorescent puncta (Figure 1A) similar to those seen with overexpressed RIα (Day et al., 2011Day M.E. Gaietta G.M. Sastri M. Koller A. Mackey M.R. Scott J.D.

Genet. 2006; 15: 2962-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These puncta are highly dynamic, and coalescence of dispersed puncta occurred on the minute scale (Figure 1B; Video S1). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments indicated that labeled RIα can dynamically exchange between the puncta and diffusible pools, as indicated by similar fluorescence recovery kinetics (time to half maximum [t1/2] of 7 s ± 0.44 s, mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM] indicated throughout the paper, n = 12 puncta versus t1/2 of 7.8 s ± 0.41 s, n = 5 cytosolic regions) (Figure 1C; Video S2), although labeled RIα showed decreased mobility within puncta (t1/2, 35 s ± 1.3 s; n = 9 regions inside RIα puncta; p < 0.0001; Figure S1A). In addition, treatment with 2.5% 1,6-hexanediol (Hex), which disrupts weak intermolecular forces present in liquid-like assemblies (Peskett et al., 2018Peskett T.R. Rau F. O’Driscoll J. Patani R.

FRAP of RIα Phase-Separated Bodies, Related to Figure 1Confocal imaging of endogenous RIα phase-separated bodies in 293-RIα cells expressing GFP1-10 showing photobleaching and recovery of fluorescence. Arrowheads indicate the photobleached puncta. Scale bar, 10 μm.3 Strikingly, purified RIα by itself formed liquid droplets in vitro (Figure 1E). Increasing molecular crowding with increasing concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) decreased the concentrations of RIα needed for liquid droplet formation (Figure 1F), whereas increasing salt (KCl) concentrations increased the concentrations of RIα needed for liquid droplet formation (Figure S1B). RIα droplets varied in size in vitro and in cells (Figure S1C), and although endogenous RIα puncta account for only 0.09% ± 0.02% of the entire cellular volume, we estimated the RIα concentration inside these puncta to be about 5.5 μM (Figures S1D and S1E). We also observed similar fluorescent puncta in various other cell types expressing RIα-GFP, such as cardiomyocytes, astrocytes, and neurons (Figures S1F–S1H). Together, these data indicate that RIα is capable of forming biomolecular condensates and that it does so at endogenous expression levels. RIα forms an obligate dimer via its N-terminal dimerization and docking (D/D) domain, which bridges its binding to A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Connecting the D/D domain and cAMP binding domains is a linker region that is relatively disordered (STAR Methods) and contains an inhibitory sequence that acts as a pseudosubstrate for PKAcat (Figure 2A; Kim et al., 2005Kim C. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Crystal structure of a complex between the catalytic and regulatory (RIalpha) subunits of PKA.Science. 2005; 307: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To probe the role of these domains in RIα LLPS, we generated a panel of EGFP-tagged RIα truncation mutants and monitored their ability to form puncta when overexpressed in wild-type HEK293T cells. No puncta were observed with mutants lacking the D/D domain or the linker region (Figures 2B and S2A–S2E), in contrast to the wild-type control, whereas fluorescent puncta were observed in cells expressing a truncation mutant containing only these two regions (Figure 2B).

The inhibitory sequence and a portion of the linker region become disordered when cAMP-bound RIα is dissociated from PKAcat (Kim et al., 2005Kim C. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Crystal structure of a complex between the catalytic and regulatory (RIalpha) subunits of PKA.Science. 2005; 307: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Because this region is involved in RIα LLPS, we hypothesized that PKAcat and cAMP might directly influence this process. Indeed, increasing concentrations of purified PKAcat increased the minimal RIα concentration required for liquid droplet formation in vitro (Figure 2C). Moreover, overexpression of PKAcat in GFP1–10-expressing 293-RIα cells decreased the number of endogenous RIα puncta per cell by 67% (p = 0.001; −PKAcat, n = 18 cells; +PKAcat, n = 16 cells) in the basal state (Figure S2F). On the other hand, cAMP directly enhances RIα LLPS in the presence of PKAcat because addition of cAMP attenuated the inhibitory effect of PKAcat on RIα liquid droplet formation in vitro and allowed liquid droplet formation at lower RIα concentrations (Figure 2C). In 293-RIα cells expressing GFP1–10, stimulation with the AC activator forskolin (Fsk) to elevate cAMP induced an acute increase in endogenous RIα puncta (70% ± 12%, n = 32 cells) (Figures 2D and 2F). Furthermore, increasing cAMP levels through the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol transiently increased the number of endogenous RIα puncta per cell (Figure 2F), consistent with the cAMP dynamics induced by this GPCR agonist (DiPilato and Zhang, 2009DiPilato L.M.

USA. 2001; 98: 13049-13054Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These data suggest that cAMP-bound RIα is more prone to undergo LLPS, consistent with an increase in disorder within the inhibitory sequence and linker region when cAMP-bound RIα dissociates from PKAcat. To observe the localization of PKAcat in this process, we stimulated HEK293T cells overexpressing RIα and PKAcat with Fsk and observed a 164% ± 32% increase in the number of RIα puncta per cell, and PKAcat co-localized with RIα puncta (Figures 2E, S2G, and S2H; Video S3; n = 22 cells). Consistent with this observation, PKAcat (1% GFP-tagged) formed liquid droplets in vitro when mixed with RIα and cAMP (Figure 2G) but did not form liquid droplets on its own (Figure S5B).

https://openalex.org/W3080140042,"In many eukaryotes, Argonaute proteins, guided by short RNA sequences, defend cells against transposons and viruses. In the eubacterium Thermus thermophilus, the DNA-guided Argonaute TtAgo defends against transformation by DNA plasmids. Here, we report that TtAgo also participates in DNA replication. In vivo, TtAgo binds 15- to 18-nt DNA guides derived from the chromosomal region where replication terminates and associates with proteins known to act in DNA replication. When gyrase, the sole T. thermophilus type II topoisomerase, is inhibited, TtAgo allows the bacterium to finish replicating its circular genome. In contrast, loss of gyrase and TtAgo activity slows growth and produces long sausage-like filaments in which the individual bacteria are linked by DNA. Finally, wild-type T. thermophilus outcompetes an otherwise isogenic strain lacking TtAgo. We propose that the primary role of TtAgo is to help T. thermophilus disentangle the catenated circular chromosomes generated by DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W3081086874,"Strained cyclic organic molecules, such as arynes, cyclic alkynes and cyclic allenes, have intrigued chemists for more than a century with their unusual structures and high chemical reactivity1. The considerable ring strain (30–50 kilocalories per mole)2,3 that characterizes these transient intermediates imparts high reactivity in many reactions, including cycloadditions and nucleophilic trappings, often generating structurally complex products4. Although strategies to control absolute stereochemistry in these reactions have been reported using stoichiometric chiral reagents5,6, catalytic asymmetric variants to generate enantioenriched products have remained difficult to achieve. Here we report the interception of racemic cyclic allene intermediates in a catalytic asymmetric reaction and provide evidence for two distinct mechanisms that control absolute stereochemistry in such transformations: kinetic differentiation of allene enantiomers and desymmetrization of intermediate π-allylnickel complexes. Computational studies implicate a catalytic mechanism involving initial kinetic differentiation of the cyclic allene enantiomers through stereoselective olefin insertion, loss of the resultant stereochemical information, and subsequent introduction of absolute stereochemistry through desymmetrization of an intermediate π-allylnickel complex. These results reveal reactivity that is available to cyclic allenes beyond the traditional cycloadditions and nucleophilic trappings previously reported, thus expanding the types of product accessible from this class of intermediates. Additionally, our computational studies suggest two potential strategies for stereocontrol in reactions of cyclic allenes. Combined, these results lay the foundation for the development of catalytic asymmetric reactions involving these classically avoided strained intermediates. Asymmetric nickel catalysis is used to intercept transient cyclic allene intermediates to achieve stereocontrol."
https://openalex.org/W3081421442,"The G2019S mutation in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a common cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). This mutation results in dopaminergic neurodegeneration via dysregulated protein translation, although how alterations in protein synthesis contribute to neurodegeneration in human neurons is not known. Here we define the translational landscape in LRRK2-mutant dopaminergic neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) via ribosome profiling. We found that mRNAs that have complex secondary structure in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) are translated more efficiently in G2019S LRRK2 neurons. This leads to the enhanced translation of multiple genes involved in Ca2+ regulation and to increased Ca2+ influx and elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels, a major contributor to PD pathogenesis. This study reveals a link between dysregulated translation control and Ca2+ homeostasis in G2019S LRRK2 human dopamine neurons, which potentially contributes to the progressive and selective dopaminergic neurotoxicity in PD."

However, studies conducted to date in Ethiopia upon short birth interval were inconclusive and they did not show the extent and determinants of short birth interval in developing (Afar, Somali, Gambella, and Benishangul-Gumuz) regions of the country. Thus, this study was intended to assess the short birth interval and its determinants in the four developing regions of the country. Methods Data were retrieved from the Demographic and Health Survey program official database website (http://dhsprogram.com). A sample of 2683 women of childbearing age group (15–49) who had at least two alive consecutive children in the four developing regions of Ethiopia was included in this study. A multilevel multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify the independent predictors of short birth interval and Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) was used during the model selection procedure. Results In this study, the prevalence of short birth interval was 46% [95% CI; 43.7%, 47.9%]. The multilevel multivariable logistic regression model showed women living in rural area [AOR = 1.52, CI: 1.12, 2.05], women attended secondary education and above level [AOR = 0.27, CI: 0.05, 0.54], have no media exposure [AOR = 1.35, CI: 1.18, 1.56], female sex of the index child [AOR = 1.13, CI:1.07,1.20], breastfeeding duration [AOR = 0.79, CI: 0.77, 0.82], having six and more ideal number of children [AOR = 1.14, CI: 1.09, 1.20] and having preferred waiting time to birth two years and above [AOR = 0.86, CI: 0.78, 0.95] were the predictors of short birth interval. Conclusions The prevalence of short birth intervals in the developing regions of Ethiopia is still high. Therefore, the government of Ethiopia should work on the access of family planning and education in rural parts of the developing regions where more than 90% of the population in these regions is pastoral."
https://openalex.org/W3081108426,"Brachycephalic breeds are proliferating internationally, with dramatic rises in popularity juxtaposed with common and severe breed-related health problems. Physical appearance is as a dominant factor attracting owners to brachycephalic breeds; however, whether these owners will choose their current breed for future ownership and develop ‘breed-loyalty’ in the face of health problems is not yet known. The aims of this study were (1) to quantify levels of, and explore factors associated with, brachycephalic dog owners’ intentions to: (i) reacquire and/or (ii) recommend their current breed to potential first-time dog owners, and (2) to use qualitative methods to explore why brachycephalic dog owners would or would not recommend their current breed. This large mixed methods study reports on 2168 owners of brachycephalic breeds (Pugs: n = 789; French Bulldog: n = 741; Bulldogs: n = 638). Owners were highly likely to want to own their breed again in the future (93.0%) and recommend their breed to other owners (65.5%). Statistical modelling identified that first-time ownership and increased strength of the dog-owner relationship increased the likelihood of reacquisition and/or recommendation. In contrast, an increased number of health problems, positive perception of their dog’s health compared with the rest of their breed, and dog behaviour being worse than expected decreased the likelihood of reacquisition and/or recommendation. Thematic analyses constructed three themes describing why owners recommend their breed: positive behavioural attributes for a companion dog, breed suited to a sedentary lifestyle with limited space, and suitability for households with children. Five themes described why owners recommended against their breed: high prevalence of health problems, expense of ownership, ethical and welfare issues associated with breeding brachycephalic dogs, negative effects upon owner lifestyle and negative behavioural attributes. Understanding how breed-loyalty develops, and whether it can be attenuated, will be key to controlling the current population boom in brachycephalic breeds in the long-term."

We used known cases of pathogenic deletions from ISCA database to specifically define regions critical for the target syndromes. Our approach to detect microdeletions, from whole genome sequencing data, is based on sample normalization and read counting for individual bins. We performed both an in-silico study using artificially created data sets and a laboratory test on mixed DNA samples, with known microdeletions, to assess the sensitivity of prediction for varying fetal fractions, deletion lengths, and sequencing read counts. The in-silico study showed sensitivity of 79.3% for 10% fetal fraction with 20M read count, which further increased to 98.4% if we searched only for deletions longer than 3Mb. The test on laboratory-prepared mixed samples was in agreement with in-silico results, while we were able to correctly detect 24 out of 29 control samples. Our results suggest that it is possible to incorporate microaberration detection into basic NIPT as part of the offered screening/diagnostics procedure, however, accuracy and reliability depends on several specific factors."

Alongside changing patterns of raw material use and decreasing artefact sizes, changes in artefact types are commonly employed to differentiate Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Later Stone Age (LSA) assemblages. The current paper employs a quantitative analytical framework based upon the use of neural networks to examine changing constellations of technologies between MSA and LSA assemblages from eastern Africa. Network ensembles were trained to differentiate LSA assemblages from Marine Isotope Stage 3&4 MSA and Marine Isotope Stage 5 MSA assemblages based upon the presence or absence of 16 technologies. Simulations were used to extract significant indicator and contra-indicator technologies for each assemblage class. The trained network ensembles classified over 94% of assemblages correctly, and identified 7 key technologies that significantly distinguish between assemblage classes. These results clarify both temporal changes within the MSA and differences between MSA and LSA assemblages in eastern Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3081176111,"Mount Everest is an extreme environment for humans. Nevertheless, hundreds of mountaineers attempt to summit Everest each year. In a previous study we analyzed interview data for all climbers (2,211) making their first attempt on Everest during 1990–2005. Probabilities of summiting were similar for men and women, declined progressively for climbers about 40 and older, but were elevated for climbers with experience climbing in Nepal. Probabilities of dying were also similar for men and women, increased for climbers about 60 and older (especially for the few that had summited), and were independent of experience. Since 2005, many more climbers (3,620) have attempted Everest. Here our primary goal is to quantify recent patterns of success and death and to evaluate changes over time. Also, we investigate whether patterns relate to key socio-demographic covariates (age, sex, host country, prior experience). Recent climbers were more diverse both in gender (women = 14.6% vs. 9.1% for 1990–2005) and in age (climbers ≥ 40 = 54.1% vs. 38.7%). Strikingly, recent climbers of both sexes were almost twice as likely to summit–and slightly less likely to die–than were comparable climbers in the previous survey. Temporal shifts may reflect improved weather forecasting, installation of fixed ropes on much of the route, and accumulative logistic equipment and experience. We add two new analyses. The probability of dying from illness or non-traumas (e.g., high-altitude illness, hypothermia), relative to dying from falling or from ‘objective hazards’ (avalanche, rock or ice fall), increased marginally with age. Recent crowding during summit bids was four-fold greater than in the prior sample, but surprisingly crowding has no evident effect on success or death during summit bids. Our results inform prospective climbers as to their current odds of success and of death, as well as inform governments of Nepal and China of the safety consequences and economic impacts of periodically debated restrictions based on climber age and experience."

https://openalex.org/W2971001246,"The World Health Organization describes zoonotic diseases as a major pandemic threat, and modeling the behavior of such diseases is a key component of their control. Many emerging zoonoses, such as SARS, Nipah, and Hendra, mutated from their wild type while circulating in an intermediate host population, usually a domestic species, to become more transmissible among humans, and moreover, this transmission route will only become more likely as agriculture and trade intensifies around the world. Passage through an intermediate host enables many otherwise rare diseases to become better adapted to humans, and so understanding this process with mathematical epidemiological models is necessary to prevent epidemics of emerging zoonoses, guide policy interventions in public health, and predict the behavior of an epidemic. In this paper, we account for spillovers of a zoonotic disease mutating in an intermediate host by means of modeling transmission dynamics within and between three host species, namely, wild reservoir, intermediate domestic animals, and humans. We calculate the basic reproductive number of the pathogen, present critical conditions for the emergence dynamics of zoonosis, and perform stability analysis of admissible disease equilibria. Our analytical results agree well with long-term simulations of the system. We find that in the presence of biologically realistic interspecies transmission parameters, a zoonotic disease can establish itself in humans even if it fails to persist in its reservoir and intermediate host species. Our model and results can be used to understand the dynamic behavior of any zoonosis with intermediate hosts and assist efforts to protect public health."
https://openalex.org/W3080859615,"Candida albicans is a dimorphic fungus that converts from a yeast form to a hyphae form during infection. This switch requires the formation of actin cable to coordinate polarized cell growth. It's known that nucleation of this cable requires a multiprotein complex localized at the tip called the polarisome, but the mechanisms underpinning this process were unclear. Here, we found that C. albicans Aip5, a homolog of polarisome component ScAip5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that nucleates actin polymerization and synergizes with the formin ScBni1, regulates actin assembly and hyphae growth synergistically with other polarisome proteins Bni1, Bud6, and Spa2. The C terminus of Aip5 binds directly to G-actin, Bni1, and the C-terminal of Bud6, which form the core of the nucleation complex to polymerize F-actin. Based on insights from structural biology and molecular dynamic simulations, we propose a possible complex conformation of the actin nucleation core, which provides cooperative positioning and supports the synergistic actin nucleation activity of a tri-protein complex Bni1-Bud6-Aip5. Together with known interactions of Bni1 with Bud6 and Aip5 in S. cerevisiae, our findings unravel molecular mechanisms of C. albicans by which the tri-protein complex coordinates the actin nucleation in actin cable assembly and hyphal growth, which is likely a conserved mechanism in different filamentous fungi and yeast."
https://openalex.org/W3080757057,"Abdominal tuberculosis (ATB) continues to pose a major diagnostic challenge for clinicians due to its nonspecific clinical presentation, variable anatomical location and lack of sensitive diagnostic tools. In spite of the development of several assays till date; no single test has proved to be adequate for ATB diagnosis. In this study, we for the first time report the detection of circulating cell-free Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) DNA (cfMTB-DNA) in ascitic fluid (AF) samples and its utility in ATB diagnosis. Sixty-five AF samples were included in the study and processed for liquid culture, cytological, biochemical and molecular assays. A composite reference standard (CRS) was formulated to categorize the patients into ‘Definite ATB’ (M. tuberculosis culture positive, n = 2), ‘Probable ATB’ (n = 16), ‘Possible ATB’ (n = 13) and ‘Non-TB’ category (n = 34). Two molecular assays were performed, namely, the novel cfMTB-DNA qPCR assay targeting M. tuberculosis devR gene and Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert), and their diagnostic accuracy was assessed using CRS as reference standard. Clinical features such as fever, loss of weight, abdominal distension and positive Mantoux were found to be strongly associated with ATB disease (p<0.05). cfMTB-DNA qPCR had a sensitivity of 66.7% (95% CI:40.9,86.7) with 97.1% specificity (95% CI:84.7,99.9) in ‘Definite ATB’ and ‘Probable ATB’ group collectively. The sensitivity increased to 70.9% (95% CI:51.9,85.8) in the combined ‘Definite’, ‘Probable’ and ‘Possible’ ATB group with similar specificity. The cfMTB-DNA qPCR assay performed significantly better than the Xpert assay which demonstrated a poor sensitivity of ≤16.7% with 100% (95% CI:89.7,100) specificity (p<0.001). We conclude that cfMTB-DNA qPCR assay is an accurate molecular test that can provide direct evidence of M. tuberculosis etiology and has promise to pave the way for improving ATB diagnosis."

We addressed laboratory, liver-related, virus-related as well as vaccine-related variables, and their association to HBV vaccine response. Differences were tested using either a Chi-squared test or a T test to compare means between the two populations. Multivariate regression was modeled as a logistic regression.1506 patients were evaluated, of which 525 received appropriate HBV vaccination and were assessed for response. Among those, 79% were vaccine responders and 21% were non-responders. On multivariate analysis, cirrhosis was associated with lower response to the vaccine (OR 0.6, CI 0.44-0.94). We found no significant differences for vaccine response in relation to smoking (87% vs 86%), IV drug abuse (74% vs 72%), Diabetes Mellitus (26% vs 22%) being on hemodialysis (2% vs.5%), or virus related variables.HCV infection seems to impair HBV vaccine response, with cirrhosis being the only identifiable risk factor for hypo-responsiveness among studied clinical and virus-related variables."

Therefore, we analyzed albumin- and immunoglobulin G-depleted plasma samples from 148 and 60 patients with HCC and CCA, respectively, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The algorithm used to measure the content of each protein was the percentage of exponentially modified protein abundance index. From 5320 proteins assayed in plasma, 53 and 25 biomarker candidates were identified for HCC and CCA, respectively. The abundance of six and two HCC markers particularly protruded in stage II and III, respectively, whereas plasma serine protease inhibitor was the sole marker the level of which steadily decreased with CCA progression. From a prognostic facet, we showed candidate markers and their cutoff levels for evaluating probability of tumor recurrence and patient survival period. Combination Kaplan-Meier models showed that HCC stage III or IV and both the content of alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein and apolipoprotein CIII <0.2% exhibited the poorest post-surgical recurrence-free and overall survivals. Furthermore, the content of afamin ≥0.2% played a significant role on the poor prognosis in patients with CCA. Our findings, taken together, characterized novel plasma biomarker signatures in dissecting tumor stages and post-surgical outcomes of HCC and CCA."
https://openalex.org/W3081257112,"The fovea is a neural specialization that endows humans and other primates with the sharpest vision among mammals. This performance originates in the foveal cones, which are extremely narrow and long to form a high-resolution pixel array. Puzzlingly, this form is predicted to impede electrical conduction to an extent that appears incompatible with vision. We observe the opposite: signal flow through even the longest cones (0.4-mm axons) is essentially lossless. Unlike in most neurons, amplification and impulse generation by voltage-gated channels are dispensable. Rather, sparse channel activity preserves intracellular current, which flows as if unobstructed by organelles. Despite these optimizations, signaling would degrade if cones were lengthier. Because cellular packing requires that cone elongation accompanies foveal expansion, this degradation helps explain why the fovea is a constant, miniscule size despite multiplicative changes in eye size through evolution. These observations reveal how biophysical mechanisms tailor form-function relationships for primate behavioral performance."

However, sitosterol cannot be accurately measured by routine diagnostic assays, meaning that sitosterolemia diagnosis can often be difficult, especially with many clinical features overlapping with familial hypercholesterolemia. With such complications resulting in increasing reports of misdiagnosis, the prevalence of sitosterolemia is predicted to be much higher than previously reported.Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was utilized to measure sitosterol levels of normocholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic children. Subsequently, an epidemiologically determined cutoff level of sitosterol was calculated and applied to estimate the prevalence of children with increased sitosterol and identify potential sitosterolemia patients. Massively parallel sequencing was used to confirm the diagnosis in suspected patients.Samples from 109 normocholesterolemic and 220 hypercholesterolemic were tested for phytosterols. Sitosterol and campesterol levels were significantly increased in hypercholesterolemic children (mean 22.0±45.9 μmol/L for sitosterol and 26.0±32.8 μmol/L for campesterol) compared to normocholesterolemic children (mean 12.1±4.9 μmol/L for sistosterol and 14.8±6.7 μmol/L for campesterol). Via application of a cutoff of 35.9 μmol/L, the prevalence rates for increased and overtly increased sitosterol in hypercholesterolemic children were 6.4% and 1.4% respectively. Furthermore, 3 suspected sitosterolemia patients were identified, with 2 patients receiving molecular confirmation for sitosterolemia diagnosis.Our findings reaffirm that the prevalence of sitosterolemia is probably much higher than previously reported, which also indicates the significant risk of misdiagnosis of sitosterolemia with familial hypercholesterolemia. Special lipid testing including sitosterol, especially in children with uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia, is recommended in children in order to identify potential sitosterolemia patients that would otherwise be neglected."

By using a newly generated transgenic line of P. falciparum (PfGCaMP3) that expresses constitutively the genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator GCaMP3, we have investigated the dynamics of Ca2+ release and influx elicited by inhibitors of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pumps, cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), and thapsigargin (Thg). Here we show that in isolated trophozoite phase parasites: (i) both CPA and Thg release Ca2+ from intracellular stores in P. falciparum parasites; (ii) Thg is able to induce Ca2+ release from an intracellular compartment insensitive to CPA; (iii) only Thg is able to activate Ca2+ influx from extracellular media, through a mechanism resembling store-operated Ca2+ entry, typical of mammalian cells; and (iv) the Thg-sensitive Ca2+ pool is unaffected by collapsing the mitochondria membrane potential with the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone or the release of acidic Ca2+ stores with nigericin. These data suggest the presence of two Ca2+ pools in P. falciparum with differential sensitivity to the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump inhibitors, and only the release of the Thg-sensitive Ca2+ store induces Ca2+ influx. Activation of the store-operated Ca2+ entry-like Ca2+ influx may be relevant for controlling processes such as parasite invasion, egress, and development mediated by kinases, phosphatases, and proteases that rely on Ca2+ levels for their activation."

One such area is the Sub-Boreal Pine-Spruce xeric-cold (SBPSxc) region in British Columbia, Canada, which is characterized by weakly-developed, parched soils that lack an organic forest floor and essential plant-available nutrients. We hypothesized that plant growth-promoting bacteria could play a significant role in sustaining the growth of lodgepole pine trees in the SBPSxc region. Testing this hypothesis, we evaluated plant growth-promoting abilities of six endophytic bacterial strains previously isolated from lodgepole pine trees growing in this region. These bacterial strains significantly enhanced the length and biomass of their natural host (lodgepole pine) as well as a foreign host (hybrid white spruce) in a 540-day long greenhouse trial. This growth stimulation could be linked to the diverse plant growth-promoting (PGP) abilities detected in these strains using in vitro assays for inorganic/organic phosphate-solubilization, siderophore production IAA production, ACC deaminase activity, lytic enzymes (chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase, protease, and cellulase) activity, ammonia production and catalase activity. ACC deaminase activity was also detected in vivo for all strains using ethylene-sensitive plants–canola and tomato. Notably, strains belonging to the Burkholderiaceae family (HP-S1r, LP-R1r and LP-R2r) showed the greatest potential in all PGP assays and enhanced pine and spruce seedling length and biomass by up to 1.5-fold and 4-fold, respectively. Therefore, such bacterial strains with multifarious PGP abilities could be crucial for survival and growth of lodgepole pine trees in the SBPSxc region and could potentially be utilized as bioinoculant for Pinaceae trees in highly disturbed and nutrient-poor ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3080918407,"The leukocyte profile has the potential to be a reliable method to measure health conditions and stress in wild animals, but limitations occur because current knowledge on reference intervals is largely incomplete, especially because data come from studies on captive animals involving few individuals from single populations. Here we propose a general framework for achieving reliable leukocyte reference intervals, encompassing a set of internal and external factors, potentially affecting the leukogram. To do so, we present a systematic survey of the hematology of the common wall lizard, Podarcis muralis, involving 794 lizards from 54 populations over the whole geographic range of the species in Italy. Reference intervals for white blood cell (WBC) and leukocyte differential count were obtained by using linear mixed models in a Bayesian framework. The application of the procedure clearly showed that both internal (sex and size) and external (latitude and season) factors are a source of variation of leukocyte profile. Furthermore, the leukogram of common wall lizard has a strong variability among populations, which accounts for more than 50% of the whole variation. Consequently, some common assumptions used in studies on captive individuals are no longer supported in wild populations, namely, i) any group of individuals is a representative sample, ii) any population is representative of all others, iii) geographic clines do not occur over the species range, and iv) seasonal variation has limited effects. We encourage researchers aimed at the definition of leukocyte reference intervals for wild populations of reptiles to involve a large number of populations over a wide geographic range in ad hoc statistical models to disentangle local and geographic effects on leukocyte profile variation."
https://openalex.org/W3080232137,"Pinyon-juniper (PJ) woodlands have drastically changed over the last century with juniper encroaching into adjacent habitats and pinyon experiencing large-scale mortality events from drought. Changes in climate and forest composition may pose challenges for animal communities found in PJ woodlands, especially if animals specialize on tree species sensitive to drought. Here we test habitat specialization of ground-dwelling arthropod (GDA) communities underneath pinyon and juniper trees. We also investigate the role of climate and productivity gradients in structuring GDAs within PJ woodlands using two elevational gradients. We sampled 12,365 individuals comprising 115 taxa over two years. We found no evidence that GDAs differ under pinyon or juniper trees, save for a single species of beetle which preferred junipers. Climate and productivity, however, were strongly associated with GDA communities and appeared to drive differences between sites. Precipitation was strongly associated with arthropod richness, while differences in GDA composition were associated with environmental variables (precipitation, temperature, vapor pressure, and normalized difference vegetation index). These relationships varied among different arthropod taxa (e.g. ants and beetles) and community metrics (e.g. richness, abundance, and composition), with individual taxa also responding differently. Overall, our results suggest that GDAs are not dependent on tree type, but are strongly linked to primary productivity and climate, especially precipitation in PJ woodlands. This implies GDAs in PJ woodlands are more susceptible to changes in climate, especially at lower elevations where it is hot and dry, than changes in dominant vegetation. We discuss management implications and compare our findings to GDA relationships with vegetation in other systems."
https://openalex.org/W3080415235,"Previously we reported that adipocyte SNAP23 (synaptosome-associated protein of 23 kDa) deficiency blocks the activation of macroautophagy, leading to an increased abundance of BAX, a pro-death Bcl-2 family member, and activation and adipocyte cell death both in vitro and in vivo Here, we found that knockdown of SNAP23 inhibited the association of the autophagosome regulators ATG16L1 and ATG9 compartments by nutrient depletion and reduced the formation of ATG16L1 membrane puncta. ATG16L1 knockdown inhibited autophagy flux and increased BAX protein levels by suppressing BAX degradation. The elevation in BAX protein had no effect on BAX activation or cell death in the nutrient-replete state. However, following nutrient depletion, BAX was activated with a concomitant induction of cell death. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that SNAP23 and ATG16L1 proteins form a stable complex independent of nutrient condition, whereas in the nutrient-depleted state, BAX binds to SNAP23 to form a ternary BAX-SNAP23-ATG16L1 protein complex. Taken together, these data support a model in which SNAP23 plays a crucial function as a scaffold for ATG16L1 necessary for the suppression of BAX activation and induction of the intrinsic cell death program."

The aim of our study was to investigate the antibiotic-resistance profiles and evaluate the various combinations of ciprofloxacin (CIP) or levofloxacin (LEV) with antimicrobial agents and non-antimicrobial agents to combat antimicrobial resistance of XDR A. baumannii. A total of 100 (6.25%) A. baumannii clinical isolates were recovered from 1600 clinical specimens collected from hospitalized patients of two major university hospitals in Upper Egypt. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were carried out according to CLSI guidelines. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the respective isolates showed a high percentage of bacterial resistance to 19 antimicrobial agents ranging from 76 to99%. However, a lower percentage of resistance was observed for only colistin (5%) and doxycycline (57%). The isolates were categorized as PDR (2; 2%), XDR (68; 68%), and multi-drug resistant (MDR) (30; 30%). Genotypic analysis using ERIC-PCR on 2 PDR and 32 selected XDR isolates showed that they were not clonal. Combinations of CIP or LEV with antibiotics (including, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, amikacin, or doxycycline) were tested on these A. baumannii non-clonal isolates using standard protocols where fractional inhibitory concentrations (−FICs) were calculated. Results of the respective combinations showed synergism in 23.5%, 17.65%, 32.35%, 17.65% and 26.47%, 8.28%, 14.71%, 26.47%, of the tested isolates, respectively. CIP or LEV combinations with either chlorpromazine (CPZ) 200 μg/ml, propranolol (PR) in two concentrations, 0.5 mg/ml and 1.0 mg/ml or diclofenac (DIC) 4 mg/ml were carried out and the MIC decrease factor (MDF) of each isolate was calculated and results showed synergism in 44%, 50%, 100%, 100% and 94%, 85%, 100%, 100%, of the tested isolates, respectively. In conclusion, combinations of CIP or LEV with CPZ, PR, or DIC showed synergism in most of the selected PDR and XDR A. baumannii clinical isolates. However, these combinations have to be re-evaluated in vivo using appropriate animal models infected by XDR- or PDR- A. baumannii."

By varying the pH of the humic-acid sample, the concentration of the titrant, and the nitrogen-gas flow rate, the optimal titration conditions were determined to be a sample pH of 4, titrant concentration of 0.05 mol/L, and nitrogen-gas flow rate of 80 mL/min. Applying the detection method to p-hydroxybenzoic acid showed that its phenolic-hydroxyl content was 758.82±111.76 cmol/kg and carboxyl content was 744.44±51.11 cmol/kg. The theoretical phenolic-hydroxyl and carboxyl-groups contents of the p-hydroxybenzoic acid were 723.96 cmol/kg respectively, indicating that the method can accurately quantify the carboxyl and phenolic-hydroxyl groups in the sample. The NACT was used to measure the phenolic-hydroxyl and carboxyl-groups contents in humic acid quickly and accurately. In addition, 29 humic acid samples from 8 provinces of China covering the main humic-acid producing areas were collected and analyzed for acidic-groups content using the reported method."
https://openalex.org/W3081067920,"Indo-Pacific lionfish have become invasive throughout the western Atlantic. Their predatory effects have been the focus of much research and are suggested to cause declines in native fish abundance and diversity across the invaded range. However, little is known about their non-consumptive effects, or their effects on invertebrates. Lionfish use shelters on the reef, thus there is potential for competition with other shelter-dwelling organisms. We demonstrate similar habitat associations between invasive lionfish, native spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus) and native long-spined sea urchins (Diadema antillarum), indicating the potential for competition. We then used a laboratory experiment to compare activity and shelter use of each species when alone and when lionfish were paired with each native species. Spiny lobsters increased their activity but did not change their shelter use in the presence of a lionfish, whilst long-spined sea urchins changed neither their activity nor shelter use. However, lionfish reduced their shelter use in the presence of spiny lobsters and long-spined sea urchins. This study highlights the importance not only of testing for the non-consumptive effects of invasive species, but also exploring whether native species exert non-consumptive effects on the invasive."
https://openalex.org/W3080279411,"Spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) and auditory evoked potentials (AEP) have been suggested to monitor the level of consciousness during anesthesia. As both signals reflect different neuronal pathways, a combination of parameters from both signals may provide broader information about the brain status during anesthesia. Appropriate parameter selection and combination to a single index is crucial to take advantage of this potential. The field of machine learning offers algorithms for both parameter selection and combination. In this study, several established machine learning approaches including a method for the selection of suitable signal parameters and classification algorithms are applied to construct an index which predicts responsiveness in anesthetized patients. The present analysis considers several classification algorithms, among those support vector machines, artificial neural networks and Bayesian learning algorithms. On the basis of data from the transition between consciousness and unconsciousness, a combination of EEG and AEP signal parameters developed with automated methods provides a maximum prediction probability of 0.935, which is higher than 0.916 (for EEG parameters) and 0.880 (for AEP parameters) using a cross-validation approach. This suggests that machine learning techniques can successfully be applied to develop an improved combined EEG and AEP parameter to separate consciousness from unconsciousness."

Power can be a useful method in predicting relative toxin concentrations within the same device, but does not correlate well to inter-device levels. Herein, we have developed a simple mathematical model utilizing parameters of an e-cigarette’s coil and wick in order to predict relative levels of e-liquid solvent degradation. Model 1, which is coil length/(wick surface area*wraps), performed in the moderate-to-substantial range as a predictive tool (R2 = 0.69). Twelve devices, spanning a range of coil and wick styles, were analyzed. Model 1 was evaluated against twelve alternative models and displayed the best predictability. Relationships that included power settings displayed weak predictability, validating that power levels cannot be reliably compared between devices due to differing wicking and coil components and heat transfer efficiencies."
https://openalex.org/W3081337750,"Transmission opportunity (TXOP) is a key factor to enable efficient channel bandwidth utilization over wireless campus networks (WCN) for interactive multimedia (IMM) applications. It facilitates in resource allocation for the similar categories of multiple packets transmission until the allocated time is expired. The static TXOP limits are defined for various categories of IMM traffics in the IEEE802.11e standard. Due to the variation of traffic load in WCN, the static TXOP limits are not sufficient enough to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) for IMM traffic flows. In order to address this issue, several existing works allocate the TXOP limits dynamically to ensure QoS for IMM traffics based on the current associated queue size and pre-setting threshold values. However, existing works do not take into account all the medium access control (MAC) overheads while estimating the current queue size which in turn is required for dynamic TXOP limits allocation. Hence, not considering MAC overhead appropriately results in inaccurate queue size estimation, thereby leading to inappropriate allocation of dynamic TXOP limits. In this article, an enhanced dynamic TXOP (EDTXOP) scheme is proposed that takes into account all the MAC overheads while estimating current queue size, thereby allocating appropriate dynamic TXOP limits within the pre-setting threshold values. In addition, the article presents an analytical estimation of the EDTXOP scheme to compute the dynamic TXOP limits for the current high priority traffic queues. Simulation results were carried out by varying traffic load in terms of packet size and packet arrival rate. The results show that the proposed EDTXOP scheme achieves the overall performance gains in the range of 4.41%—8.16%, 8.72%—11.15%, 14.43%—32% and 26.21%—50.85% for throughput, PDR, average ETE delay and average jitter, respectively when compared to the existing work. Hence, offering a better TXOP limit allocation solution than the rest."
https://openalex.org/W3081446706,"Although popular culture describes them as mortal enemies, more and more often, dogs and cats live under the same roof. Does this make them best friends? Can sharing the same social and physical environment make them similar? This study compares the approaches of dogs and cats living in the same household have towards humans and other pets as perceived by the owner. Questionnaires collected from 1270 people owning both dog(s) and cat(s) were analysed. Most dogs and cats living together are playful with familiar humans (76.2%) but dogs have a more sociable approach towards strangers and conspecifics than cats (P<0.001). Moreover, the percentage of dogs that have a playful relationship with the owner (84.0%) was higher than cats (49.2%; P<0.001). Dogs and cats living together eat in different places and show different mutual interactions: more dogs lick the cat (42.8%) and more cats ignore the dog (41.8%) than vice versa (P<0.001). However, most dogs and cats sleep at least occasionally (68.5%) and play together (62.4%; P<0.001). Although some body postures, such as the tail’s position, are interpreted differently by the two species, the greater proportions of dogs and cats show a relaxed response to several kinds of approaches of their roommate. Our questionnaire confirms the common beliefs about the sociability of the dog and the privacy of the cat, but this does not result in continuous internal struggles. Most cohabitations are peaceful. Moreover, it is true that they speak different languages, but they seem to understand each other well and interpret each other's approaches in the right way. Thus, aspiring owners should not blindly believe popular assumptions, but both knowledge and respect for species-specific pet behaviours are essential to establish a balance in the household."
https://openalex.org/W3080134760,"One of the most studied mechanisms involved in bacterial evolution and diversification is conjugative transfer (CT) of plasmids. Plasmids able to transfer by CT often encode beneficial traits for bacterial survival under specific environmental conditions. Rhizobium etli CFN42 is a Gram-negative bacterium of agricultural relevance due to its symbiotic association with Phaseolus vulgaris through the formation of Nitrogen-fixing nodules. The genome of R. etli CFN42 consists of one chromosome and six large plasmids. Among these, pRet42a has been identified as a conjugative plasmid. The expression of the transfer genes is regulated by a quorum sensing (QS) system that includes a traI gene, which encodes an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) synthase and two transcriptional regulators (TraR and CinR). Recently, we have shown that pRet42a can perform CT on the root surface and inside nodules. The aim of this work was to determine the role of plant-related compounds in the CT of pRet42a. We found that bean root exudates or root and nodule extracts induce the CT of pRet42a in the plant rhizosphere. One possibility is that these compounds are used as nutrients, allowing the bacteria to increase their growth rate and reach the population density leading to the activation of the QS system in a shorter time. We tested if P. vulgaris compounds could substitute the bacterial AHL synthesized by TraI, to activate the conjugation machinery. The results showed that the transfer of pRet42a in the presence of the plant is dependent on the bacterial QS system, which cannot be substituted by plant compounds. Additionally, individual compounds of the plant exudates were evaluated; among these, some increased and others decreased the CT. With these results, we suggest that the plant could participate at different levels to modulate the CT, and that some compounds could be activating genes in the conjugation machinery."
https://openalex.org/W3080311311,"In addition to quantitative individual differences in working memory (WM) capacity, qualitative aspects, such as enhanced sensory modality (modality dominance), can characterize individual WM ability. This study aimed to examine the neurological basis underlying the individual modality dominance component of WM using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). To quantify the degree of individual WM modality dominance, 24 participants were required to find seven hidden targets and hold their spatial location and appearance order with vibrotactile or visual stimuli aids. In this searching task, eight participants demonstrated higher performance with the tactile condition (tactile-dominant) whereas sixteen demonstrated visual dominance. We then measured prefrontal activity by fNIRS during memorization of visual stimulus numbers while finger tapping as a cognitive-motor dual-task. Individual modality dominance significantly correlated with bilateral frontopolar and dorsolateral prefrontal activity changes over repeated fNIRS sessions. In particular, individuals with stronger visual dominance showed marked decreases in prefrontal area activity. These results suggest that distinct processing patterns in the prefrontal cortex reflect an individual’s qualitative WM characteristics. Considering the individual modality dominance underlying the prefrontal areas could enhance cognitive or motor performance, possibly by optimizing cognitive resources."
https://openalex.org/W3080836199,"Gentian is an important ornamental flower in Japan. The corolla of the majority of cultivated Japanese gentians have green spots, which are rarely encountered in flowers of other angiosperms. Little information is available on the functional traits of the green spots. In this study, we characterized the green spots in the Japanese gentian corolla using a number of microscopic techniques. Opto-digital microscopy revealed that a single visible green spot is composed of approximately 100 epidermal cells. The epidermal cells of a green spot formed a dome-like structure and the cell lumen contained many green structures that were granular and approximately 5 μm in diameter. The green structures emitted red autofluorescence when irradiated with 488 nm excitation light. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the green structures contained typical thylakoids and grana, thus indicating they are chloroplasts. No grana were observed and the thylakoids had collapsed in the plastids of epidermal cells surrounding green spots. To estimate the rate of photosynthetic electron transfer of the green spots, we measured chlorophyll fluorescence using the MICROSCOPY version of an Imaging-PAM (pulse-amplitude-modulated) fluorometer. Under actinic light of 449 μmol m-2 s-1, substantial electron flow through photosystem II was observed. Observation of green spot formation during corolla development revealed that immature green spots formed at an early bud stage and developed to maturity associated with chloroplast degradation in the surrounding epidermal cells. These results confirmed that the Japanese gentian corolla contains functional chloroplasts in restricted areas of epidermal cells and indicated that a sophisticated program for differential regulation of chloroplast formation and degradation is operative in the epidermis."

The species boundaries within both of L. rufiantennus+Fruhstorferiola tonkinensis and F. viridifemorata species groups are unclear. In this study, we explored the phylogenetic positions of the genus Longgenacris and the species L. rufiantennus and the relationships among F. viridifemorata group based on the 658-base fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcode and the complete sequences of the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1 and ITS2) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. The phylogenies were reconstructed in maximum likelihood framework using IQ-TREE. K2P distances were used to assess the overlap range between intraspecific variation and interspecific divergence. Phylogenetic species concept and NJ tree, K2P distance, the statistical parsimony network as well as the generalized mixed Yule coalescent model (GMYC) were employed to delimitate the species boundaries in L. rufiantennus+F. tonkinensis and F. viridifemorata species groups. The results demonstrated that the genus Longgenacris should be placed in the subfamily Melanoplinae but not Catantopinae, and L. rufiantennus should be a member of the genus Fruhstorferiola but not Longgenacris. Species boundary delimitation confirmed the presence of oversplitting in L. rufiantennus+F. tonkinensis and F. viridifemorata species groups and suggested that each group should be treated as a single species."

https://openalex.org/W3081506022,"Eavesdropping is the acquisition of information by observing third-party interactions. Considering dogs’ (Canis lupus familiaris) dependence on humans, it would be beneficial for them to eavesdrop on human interactions to choose an appropriate partner to associate with. Previous studies have found that dogs preferred a human who acted generously or cooperatively towards another human over one who acted selfishly or non-cooperatively, however they often did not control for potential location biases. This study controlled for local enhancement and investigated whether dogs derive and act on information about unfamiliar humans through reputation-like inferences by observing third-party interactions. 42 dogs participated in the experiment, which consisted of an observation phase and a test phase. In the observation phase, the animals observed a human with a box of food ask for help to open it from two people—one was helpful and the other was not. The test phase consisted of the impossible task and a choice test. Half of the sample was tested in the experimental condition and the other half was tested in the side control condition, where the two people swapped positions before the test phase. The results of the impossible task showed that dogs only looked at the helpful person first when the people stayed on the same side as they did in the observation phase. In the choice test, dogs chose at random, regardless of whether the people stayed on the same side or swapped positions. Our findings provide tentative support for a local enhancement interpretation of eavesdropping."

However, it is not well known how persisting CD8 T cells are generated. In this study, we analyzed CD8 T cells primed by antigens in tumor-draining lymph nodes and found that CD8 T cells first differentiated into a CD62L-intermediate (CD62Lint) stage upon antigen stimulation. These cells gave rise to tumor-infiltrating CD62L-CD44high Bcl6- effector T cells and CD62L+CD44highBcl6+ memory-like T cells. Memory-like T cells within the tumor expressed CD127, CXCR3 and had the potential to proliferate significantly when they were transferred into tumor-bearing mice. Bcl6 expression in these T cells was critical because Bcl6-/-CD62L+CD44highCD8T cells within the tumor were defective in expansion after secondary transfer. Taken together, our findings show that CD62L+CD44highBcl6+ cells are generated from highly proliferating CD62Lint T cells and retain high proliferative potential, which contributes to replenishment of effector T cells within the tumor."
https://openalex.org/W3014470382,"Reliability analysis allows for the estimation of a system’s probability of detecting and identifying outliers. Failure to identify an outlier can jeopardize the reliability level of a system. Due to its importance, outliers must be appropriately treated to ensure the normal operation of a system. System models are usually developed from certain constraints. Constraints play a central role in model precision and validity. In this work, we present a detailed investigation of the effects of the hard and soft constraints on the reliability of a measurement system model. Hard constraints represent a case in which there exist known functional relations between the unknown model parameters, whereas the soft constraints are employed where such functional relations can be slightly violated depending on their uncertainty. The results highlighted that the success rate of identifying an outlier for the case of hard constraints is larger than soft constraints. This suggested that hard constraints be used in the stage of pre-processing data for the purpose of identifying and removing possible outlying measurements. After identifying and removing possible outliers, one should set up the soft constraints to propagate their uncertainties to the model parameters during the data processing."

We used RNA-Seq to explore the systemic response of Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) gene expression to three levels of Mycoplasma infection to better understand the host response to this bacterial pathogen. We found over an order of magnitude more genes differentially expressed between male and female tortoises (1,037 genes) than differentially expressed among immune groups (40 genes). There were 8 genes differentially expressed among both variables that can be considered sex-biased immune genes in this tortoise. Among experimental immune groups we find enriched GO biological processes for cysteine catabolism, regulation of type 1 interferon production, and regulation of cytokine production involved in immune response. Sex-biased transcription involves iron ion transport, iron ion homeostasis, and regulation of interferon-beta production to be enriched. More detailed work is needed to assess the seasonal response of the candidate genes found here. How seasonal fluctuation of testosterone and corticosterone modulate the immunosuppression of males and their susceptibility to Mycoplasma infection also warrants further investigation, as well as the importance of iron in the immune function and sex-biased differences of this species. Finally, future transcriptional studies should avoid drawing blood from tortoises via subcarapacial venipuncture as the variable aspiration of lymphatic fluid will confound the differential expression of genes."

We extracted and formally compared 'how' (i.e., visual arrangement) and 'what' information was presented.We identified 103 RRs (52 JP and 51 NJP) from 2016. A higher percentage of certain features were observed in JP RRs compared to NJP RRs (e.g., reporting authors; use of a traditional journal article structure; section headers including abstract, methods, discussion, conclusions, acknowledgments, conflict of interests, and author contributions; and use of figures (e.g., Study Flow Diagram) in the main document). For NJP RRs, a higher percentage of features were observed (e.g., use non-traditional report structures; bannering of executive summary sections and appendices; use of typographic cues; and including outcome tables). NJP RRs were more than double in length versus JP RRs. Including key messages was uncommon in both groups.This comparative study highlights differences between JP and NJP RRs. Both groups may benefit from better use of plain language, and more clear and concise design.

https://openalex.org/W3080902157,"Purpose Real-time monitoring of physiological changes of tumor tissue during radiation therapy (RT) could improve therapeutic efficacy and predict therapeutic outcomes. Cherenkov radiation is a normal byproduct of radiation deposited in tissue. Previous studies in rat tumors have confirmed a correlation between Cherenkov emission spectra and optical measurements of blood-oxygen saturation based on the tissue absorption coefficients. The purpose of this study is to determine if it is feasible to image Cherenkov emissions during radiation therapy in larger human-sized tumors of pet dogs with cancer. We also wished to validate the prior work in rats, to determine if Cherenkov emissions have the potential to act an indicator of blood-oxygen saturation or water-content changes in the tumor tissue–both of which have been correlated with patient prognosis. Methods A DoseOptics camera, built to image the low-intensity emission of Cherenkov radiation, was used to measure Cherenkov intensities in a cohort of cancer-bearing pet dogs during clinical irradiation. Tumor type and location varied, as did the radiation fractionation scheme and beam arrangement, each planned according to institutional standard-of-care. Unmodulated radiation was delivered using multiple 6 MV X-ray beams from a clinical linear accelerator. Each dog was treated with a minimum of 16 Gy total, in ≥3 fractions. Each fraction was split into at least three subfractions per gantry angle. During each subfraction, Cherenkov emissions were imaged. Results We documented significant intra-subfraction differences between the Cherenkov intensities for normal tissue, whole-tumor tissue, tissue at the edge of the tumor and tissue at the center of the tumor (p<0.05). Additionally, intra-subfraction changes suggest that Cherenkov emissions may have captured fluctuating absorption properties within the tumor. Conclusion Here we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain Cherenkov emissions from canine cancers within a fraction of radiotherapy. The entire optical spectrum was obtained which includes the window for imaging changes in water and hemoglobin saturation. This lends credence to the goal of using this method during radiotherapy in human patients and client-owned pets."

While previous studies have indicated the safety of this practice, real-world comprehensive outcomes, case volume changes, economic impacts, and readmission rates at diverse healthcare centers with and without cSoS remain poorly understood. Methods Consecutive patients undergoing non-PPCI at 47 hospitals (33 cSoS and 14 non-cSoS) in Michigan from April 2016 to March 2018 were included. Using propensity-matching, patients were analyzed to assess outcomes and trends in non-PPCI performance at sites with and without cSOS. Results Of 61,864 PCI’s performed, 50,817 were non-PPCI, with 46,096 (90.7%) performed at sites with cSoS and 4,721 (9.3%) at sites without cSoS. From this cohort, 4,643 propensity-matched patients were analyzed. Rates of major adverse cardiac events (2.6% vs. 2.8%; p = 0.443), in-hospital mortality (0.6% vs. 0.5%; p = 0.465), and several secondary clinical and quality outcomes showed no clinically significant differences. Among a small subset with available post-discharge data, there were no differences in 90-day readmission rates, standardized episode costs, or post-discharge mortality. Overall PCI volume remained stable, with a near three-fold rise in non-PPCI at sites without cSoS. Conclusions Non-PPCI at centers without cardiac SoS was associated with similar comprehensive outcomes, quality of care, 90-day episode costs, and post-discharge mortality compared with surgical sites. Mandatory quality oversight serves to maintain appropriate equivalent outcomes and may be considered for other programs, including the performance of non-PPCI at ambulatory surgical centers in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W3081287378,"Arthropods are a major soil fauna group, and have the potential to substantially influence the spatial and temporal variability of soil greenhouse gas (GHG) sinks and sources. The overall effect of soil-inhabiting arthropods on soil GHG fluxes still remains poorly quantified since the majority of the available data comes from laboratory experiments, is often controversial, and has been limited to a few species. The main objective of this study was to provide first insights into field-level carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) release of soil-inhabiting larvae of the Scarabaeidae family. Larvae of the genus Melolontha were excavated at various sites in west-central and southern Germany, covering a wide range of different larval developmental stages, larval activity levels, and vegetation types. Excavated larvae were immediately incubated in the field to measure their GHG production. Gaseous carbon release of individual larvae showed a large inter- and intra-site variability which was strongly correlated to larval biomass. This correlation persisted when upscaling individual CO2 and CH4 production to the plot scale. Field release estimates for Melolontha spp. were subsequently upscaled to the European level to derive the first regional GHG release estimates for members of the Scarabaeidae family. Estimates ranged between 10.42 and 409.53 kt CO2 yr-1, and 0.01 and 1.36 kt CH4 yr-1. Larval N2O release was only sporadically observed and not upscaled. For one site, a comparison of field- and laboratory-based GHG production measurements was conducted to assess potential biases introduced by transferring Scarabaeidae larvae to artificial environments. Release strength and variability of captive larvae decreased significantly within two weeks and the correlation between larval biomass and gaseous carbon production disappeared, highlighting the importance of field measurements. Overall, our data show that Scarabaeidae larvae can be significant soil GHG sources and should not be neglected in soil GHG flux research."
https://openalex.org/W3081446991,"The neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain; however, it is becoming more evident that this non-proteinogenic amino acid plays multiple physiological roles in biology. In the present study, the transport and function of GABA is studied in the highly infectious intracellular bacterium Brucella abortus. The data show that 3H-GABA is imported by B. abortus under nutrient limiting conditions and that the small RNAs AbcR1 and AbcR2 negatively regulate this transport. A specific transport system, gts, is responsible for the transport of GABA as determined by measuring 3H-GABA transport in isogenic deletion strains of known AbcR1/2 regulatory targets; however, this locus is unnecessary for Brucella infection in BALB/c mice. Similar assays revealed that 3H-GABA transport is uninhibited by the 20 standard proteinogenic amino acids, representing preference for the transport of 3H-GABA. Metabolic studies did not show any potential metabolic utilization of GABA by B. abortus as a carbon or nitrogen source, and RNA sequencing analysis revealed limited transcriptional differences between B. abortus 2308 with or without exposure to GABA. While this study provides evidence for GABA transport by B. abortus, questions remain as to why and when this transport is utilized during Brucella pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3081449732,"Snow algae are microalgae, growing in melting snowpacks, and are thought to act as primary producers in the snow ecosystem. Chloromonas (Volvocales, Chlorophyceae) contains more than 15 snow-inhabiting species. Although vegetative cells and zygotes, or asexual cysts, of snow species of the genus are frequently collected in the field, sexual reproduction and zygote formation in culture have only been induced in C. tughillensis. Here we describe the sexual reproduction of another snow-inhabiting species, C. fukushimae, which was induced using both previously examined and newly established Japanese strains. Mating of isogamous gametes began after mixing two different strains, implying that C. fukushimae is an outcrossing species. Motile and nonmotile zygotes of the species were also described in this report. The nonmotile zygote of C. fukushimae was distinguishable from those of the other snow-inhabiting species of Chloromonas, based on the zygote shape and the presence of several large lipid bodies within the cell. In addition, C. fukushimae carried out sexual reproduction and produced zygotes even under the nitrogen-sufficient condition."
https://openalex.org/W3081443828,"Working memory (WM) is the key process linking perception to action. Several lines of research have, accordingly, highlighted WM’s engagement in sensori-motor associations between retrospective stimuli and future behavior. Using human fMRI we investigated whether prior information about the effector used to respond in a WM task would have an impact on the way the same sensory stimulus is maintained in memory despite a behavioral response could not be readily planned. We focused on WM-related activity in posterior parietal cortex during the maintenance of spatial items for a subsequent match-to-sample comparison, which was reported either with a verbal or with a manual response. We expected WM activity to be higher for manual response trials, because of posterior parietal cortex’s engagement in both spatial WM and hand movement preparation. Increased fMRI activity for manual response trials in bilateral anterior intraparietal sulcus confirmed our expectations. These results imply that the maintenance of sensory material in WM is optimized for motor context, i.e. for the effector that will be relevant in the upcoming behavioral responses."
https://openalex.org/W3081486249,"Indeterminate HIV test results are common, but little is known about the evolution of indeterminate serology and its sociodemographic and behavioral correlates. We assessed future HIV serological outcomes for individuals with indeterminate results and associated factors in Rakai, Uganda.115,944 serological results, defined by two enzyme immunoassay (EIAs), among 39,440 individuals aged 15-49 years in the Rakai Community Cohort Study were assessed. Indeterminate results were defined as contradictory EIAs. Modified Poisson regression models with generalized estimating equations were used to assess prevalence ratios (PRs) of subsequent HIV serological outcomes and factors associated with HIV indeterminate results.The prevalence of HIV serologically indeterminate results was 4.9%. Indeterminate results were less likely among women than men (adjPR 0.76, 95% CI 0.71,0.81), in unmarried participants than married participants (adjPR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85,99), and in individuals with primary (adjPR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80,1.02), secondary (adjPR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73,0.96) and post-secondary (adjPR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60,0.94) education, relative to no education. The proportions of persons with indeterminate results progressing to HIV positive, negative or indeterminate results in subsequent visits was 5%, 71% and 24%, respectively.HIV serologically indeterminate results were associated with gender and marital status. HIV surveillance programs should develop a protocol for reporting individuals with mixed or persistently indeterminate HIV results on multiple follow-up visits. Most indeterminate results became HIV-negative over time, but follow-up is still needed to detect positive serologies."
