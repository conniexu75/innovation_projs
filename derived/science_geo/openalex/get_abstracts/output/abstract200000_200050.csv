It has long been known by histologists that mast cells “are numerous in parts where fat is being laid down”4. This, and the extraction of active clearing factor preparations from adipose tissue5, suggested to us that heparin might be an essential agent in fat mobilization and deposition, and in consequence be present in all animal fat. As a preliminary step we have determined the amount of heparin in the adipose tissue of cattle and the study forms the subject of this communication."

There is thus drawn to a close an investigation that was initiated many years ago in Berlin in the Imperial Institute of Physics (9)."

https://openalex.org/W2095203723,"IT is generally supposed1 that there is a close relationship between the sex chromosomes and the nucleoli in most species, though the evidence for this in mammals is scanty2. It is nearly certain that the sex chromatin body3 found in most nuclei in females of some species, including man, represents the heterochromatin of the X chromosome pair4. The demonstration of a persistent connexion between these bodies in some nuclei may serve to support both hypotheses. Reitalu5 has described such a connexion in human fœtal liver; the matter seems important enough to justify this further description, based on observations, made in ignorance of Reitalu's, of similar structures seen elsewhere."

Small amounts of the enzymes adenase and guanase have been reported in Hydrophilus and Dytiscus 2 and in Prodenia and Tenebrio 3. Larvæ and pupæ of Antheraea pernyi Guér. (Lepidoptera) contain adenine, hypoxanthine and xanthine4. At Lethbridge, female sheep keds have been found to excrete xanthine and hypoxanthine as well as uric acid. Male keds excreted only uric acid."

https://openalex.org/W2315214613,"IT has been suggested that the hyperglycæmic substance present in the blood of the pancreaticoduodenal vein of animals treated with the growth hormone of the pituitary gland is 5-hydroxytryptamine1. This amine may be derived from the enterochromaffin or other cells of the gastrointestinal tract. Yet injections of 5-hydroxytryptamine into normal dogs fail to produce a significant rise in blood sugar, although similar injections into depancreatized animals result in hyperglycæmia. Thus the pancreas may be responsible for the inactivation of 5-hydroxytryptamine."

Samples of important calcium sources such as milk, vegetables, cereals, and tap water were includcd. From an analysis of the data it is concluded that the strontium- 90 conient in ihe dlet of an average United States citizen in 1957 was about 6.5 Sunshine Units. corresponding to an equilibrium base level of 1.5 Sunshine Units, since the discrimination factor belween diet and base appears to be about 4. If the diet concentration remains constant for a decade. the equilibrium bone level of 1.6 Sunshine Unit would be approached by young children. New-born children would have about half of this value on account of fetal discrimination, and adults would reach only 20 to 30 percent of the equillbrium level, because of the slow rate of exchange of calclum in bone.

One of these (spectrum h) has been found to be identical with the spectrum given by a sample of pure 1,2,3,4-dibenzopyrene, which has since become available for reference."
