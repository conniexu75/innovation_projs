https://openalex.org/W2076372887,"In tumor cells from virtually all patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, the Philadelphia chromosome, a fusion of chromosomes 9 and 22, directs the synthesis of the P210bcr/abl protein. The protein-tyrosine kinase activity and hybrid structure of P210bcr/abl are similar to the oncogene product of the Abelson murine leukemia virus, P160gag/v-abl, which induces acute lymphomas. To determine whether P210bcr/abl can induce chronic myelogenous leukemia, murine bone marrow was infected with a retrovirus encoding P210bcr/abl and transplanted into irradiated syngeneic recipients. Transplant recipients developed several hematologic malignancies; prominent among them was a myeloproliferative syndrome closely resembling the chronic phase of human chronic myelogenous leukemia. Tumor tissue from diseased mice harbored the provirus encoding P210bcr/abl. These results demonstrate that P210bcr/abl expression can induce chronic myelogenous leukemia. Retrovirus-mediated expression of the protein provides a murine model system for further analysis of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1982745900,"We recently detected a novel activated oncogene by transfection analysis on NIH 3T3 cells in five out of 20 primary human thyroid papillary carcinomas and in the available lymph node metastases. We designated this transforming gene PTC (for papillary thyroid carcinoma). Here we describe the molecular cloning and sequencing of the gene. The new oncogene resulted from the rearrangement of an unknown amino-terminal sequence to the tyrosine kinase domain of the ret proto-oncogene. This gene rearrangement was detected in all of the transfectants and in all of the original tumor DNAs, but not in normal DNA of the same patients, thus indicating that this genetic lesion occurred in vivo and is specific to somatic tumors. Moreover, the transcript coded for by the fused gene was detected in an additional PTC-positive human papillary carcinoma for which mRNA was available."
https://openalex.org/W2056652776,"Entry into mitosis in fission yeast is controlled by the p34cdc2 protein kinase, which is activated by cdc25+ and inhibited by wee1+. In “wee” mutants one or the other of these controls is circumvented resulting in advancement of mitosis. We report that dependence of mitosis on DNA synthesis is lost in wee mutants in which cdc25+ control is circumvented either by mutations in cdc2+ or by overproduction of cdc25+. In contrast, dependence is maintained when the weel+ control is bypassed. We propose that cdc25+ activity requires completion of earlier cell-cycle events such as DNA synthesis, and thus links p34cdc2 kinase activation to completion of these earlier events. Constitutive expression of cdc25+ homologs could explain why mitosis is not dependent on DNA replication in some early embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2015625581,"Expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 structural proteins requires both the viral Rev trans-activator and its cis-acting RNA target sequence, the Rev response element (RRE). The RRE has been mapped to a conserved region of the HIV-1 env gene and is predicted to form a complex, highly stable RNA stem-loop structure. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to define a small subdomain of the RRE, termed stem-loop II, that is essential for biological activity. Gel retardation assays demonstrated that the Rev trans-activator is a sequence-specific RNA binding protein. The RRE stem-loop II subdomain was found to be both necessary and sufficient for the binding of Rev by the RRE. We propose that the HIV-1 Rev trans-activator belongs to a new class of sequence-specific RNA binding proteins characterized by the presence of an arginine-rich binding motif."
https://openalex.org/W1596685255,"We have demonstrated a dramatic induction of manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) mRNA levels in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-1, and tumor necrosis factor in pulmonary epithelial cells. These stimuli had no effect on the corresponding mRNA levels for the copper/zinc (Cu/Zn)-SOD. Identical treatments of pulmonary fibroblast cells with LPS showed only minor changes in the Mn-SOD mRNA levels demonstrating a cell type-specific effect for this acute inflammatory mediator. Furthermore, we have shown that hyperoxia has no effect within 24 h on Mn-or Cu/Zn-SOD mRNA levels in either fibroblasts or epithelial cells. The induction of Mn-SOD mRNA levels by LPS is completely inhibited by actinomycin. Treatment of cells with cycloheximide causes an induction equal to that for LPS, whereas co-treatment with cycloheximide and LPS resulted in a super induction. This data is strongly suggestive of an important role for the Mn-SOD in the acute inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1557263829,"Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) profoundly affect endothelial cell function, promoting for example interaction with leukocytes and inducing a procoagulant phenotype. Changes of this nature are likely to be central to the proinflammatory effects of TNF. In order to elucidate molecular mechanisms by which TNF alters endothelial cell function we utilized differential plaque hybridization to identify TNF-responsive genes. Forty TNF-inducible cDNAs were identified which on cross-hybridization were found to arise from six unique genes. DNA sequencing of these cDNAs revealed two encoded known cytokine-induced genes, endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 and neutrophil chemotactic factor. One of the cDNAs encodes a recently described monocyte-specific chemotactic factor not previously associated with endothelium. The production of a monocyte chemotaxin by cytokine-activated endothelium has important implications for understanding the role of the vessel wall in disease states such as atherosclerosis and may also in part explain the indirect angiogenic activity of TNF. The three other cDNAs are completely novel as judged by data bank searches of partial DNA sequences and remain unidentified. On exposure of endothelial cells to TNF there is a rapid and substantial increase in levels of mRNA encoding the six genes, which are further superinduced by cycloheximide. Thus these represent primary response genes as their induction does not depend on protein synthesis. Interleukin-1 beta and lipopolysaccharide are also potent inducers. Nuclear run-on studies revealed that in most cases induction by TNF is mediated largely at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2046837764,"Drosophila fasciclin I is a homophilic cell adhesion molecule expressed in the developing embryo on the surface of a subset of fasciculating CNS axons, all PNS axons, and some nonneuronal cells. We have identified protein-null mutations in the fasciclin I (fas I) gene, and show that these mutants are viable and do not display gross defects in nervous system morphogenesis. The Drosophila Abelson (abl) proto-oncogene homolog encodes a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that is expressed during embryogenesis primarily in developing CNS axons; abl mutants show no gross defects in CNS morphogenesis. However, embryos doubly mutant for fas I and abl display major defects in CNS axon pathways, particularly in the commissural tracts where expression of these two proteins normally overlaps. The double mutant shows a clear defect in growth cone guidance; for example, the RP1 growth cone (normally fas I positive) does not follow its normal path across the commissure."

https://openalex.org/W1523034549,"A series of glutathione S-transferase pi (GST-pi) transfectant cell lines have been constructed in activated c-H-ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells (pT22-3) by using a pKOneo plasmid and an expression vector containing cDNA for GST-pi with a beta-actin gene promoter. From the wild type pT22-3 cells, two clones were selected and designated RGN1 and RGN2. The degree of overexpression of GST-pi was estimated by Northern and Southern blot analysis to be incrementally higher in RGN2 compared with RGN1. Translation of mRNA was estimated by Western blot analysis using isozyme-specific polyclonal antibodies and confirmed the relative GST-pi levels. Each cell line, including the wild type, expressed alpha and mu class isozymes to the same degree and had similar but negligible expression of the mdr 1 gene. Sensitivity to various anticancer drugs and radiation was estimated by a series of cytotoxicity assays. The data confirmed that GST-pi provided a degree of protection against the toxicity of ethacrynic acid and adriamycin, but sensitivity to alkylating agents such as chlorambucil, melphalan, and cis-platinum was not influenced by GST-pi. Similarly, the response to ionizing radiation was similar for each line. Since the levels of intracellular GSH were also not significantly different, the availability of co-substrate was not a factor in determining response. In creating the GST-pi transfectants, these data establish that while increased isozyme levels can play a role in determining sensitivity to some agents, the protective effect is selective."
https://openalex.org/W1529498974,"The intracellular processing of the gp160 HIV-1 envelope precursor was characterized in acutely infected CD4+ T cells. Our data show that gp160 undergoes endoproteolytic cleavage by a nonacid dependent protease(s) in the rough endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex, within cis or medial cisternae, and is not transported to the cell surface. Two-dimensional electrophoretic pulse-chase analysis indicates that it takes greater than 2 h for gp160 to be transported from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the site of action of sialyltransferases in the trans Golgi. Evidence is presented that gp160 is subject to mannose trimming in the Golgi complex, which is inhibited by 1-deoxymannojirimycin (a specific Golgi alpha-mannosidase I inhibitor). Preliminary data also suggest that gp120 is post-translationally modified by sialylated O-linked oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1605985146,"Cytochrome P-450BM-3 is a catalytically self-sufficient enzyme which monooxygenates saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, alcohols, and amides. The protein has two domains: one which contains heme and is P-450-like and the other which contains FAD and FMN and is P-450 reductase-like. Both domains are on a single polypeptide chain. Utilizing a plasmid containing the gene encoding P-450BM-3, we have transformed the Escherichia coli strain DH5 alpha. This clone overexpresses P-450BM-3 to make approximately 20% of the soluble protein of this organism under optimal conditions. P-450BM-3 can be purified to homogeneity from the soluble fraction of the protein of these cells with a recovery of 50% making this cell line an excellent source of this important enzyme. Purified preparations of P-450BM-3 hydroxylate palmitic acid at a rate of 1600 mol/min/mol of heme at 25 degrees C. The stoichiometry of NADPH to oxygen utilized was 1 for all conditions; however, the ratio of oxygen or NADPH utilized per molecule of fatty acid substrate metabolized was different for different homologs of saturated fatty acids, when low concentrations (less than 100 microM) of substrate were used. Lauric and myristic acids were metabolized to two hydroxylated products, irrespective of the initial concentration of fatty acid in the reaction mixture, and the ratio of oxygen consumed to fatty acid hydroxylated was 1. High concentrations of palmitic acid (greater than 200 microM) led to the formation of three polar metabolites and a stoichiometry of 1:1 was observed for oxygen and palmitic acid utilization. These results indicate that a single hydroxyl group was inserted into each of these molecules. Lower concentrations (less than 50 microM) of palmitic acid were metabolized to additional polar metabolites, and the ratio of oxygen consumed to fatty acid substrate consumed approximated 3:1. These results can be explained best by a hypothesis that the initial hydroxylated compounds, which accumulate during the oxidation of palmitic acid by P-450BM-3, can be further oxidized by this enzyme to polyhydroxy- or hydroxy-ketone products."
https://openalex.org/W2029467097,"A region in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) env message, with the potential to form a complex secondary structure (designated RRE), interacts with the rev protein (Rev). This interaction is believed to mediate export of HIV structural messenger RNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In this report the regions essential for Rev interaction with the RRE are further characterized and the functional significance of Rev-RRE interaction in vivo is examined. A single hairpin loop structure within the RRE was found to be a primary determinant for Rev binding in vitro and Rev response in vivo. Maintenance of secondary structure, rather than primary nucleotide sequence alone, appeared to be necessary for Rev-RNA interaction, which distinguishes it from the mechanism for cis-acting elements in DNA. Limited changes within the 200 nucleotides, which preserved the proper RRE conformational structure, were well tolerated for Rev binding and function. Thus, variation among the RRE elements present in the diverse HIV isolates would have little, if any, effect on Rev responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W1732388491,"Histatin 5 (Asp1-Ser-His-Ala4-Lys-Arg-His-His8-Gly-Tyr-Lys-Arg12-Lys-Ph e-His-Glu16-Lys-His - His-Ser20-His-Arg-Gly-Tyr24), one of the basic histidine-rich peptides present in human parotid saliva and several of its fragments, 1-16 (N16), 9-24 (C16), 11-24 (C14), 13-24 (C12), 15-24 (C10), and 7-16 (M10), were synthesized by solid-phase procedures. Native histatin 5 from human parotid saliva was also purified. Their antifungal activities on two strains of Candida albicans have been studied and their conformational preferences both in aqueous and non-aqueous solutions examined by circular dichroism. The synthetic histatin 5, C16, and C14 peptides were highly active and inhibited the growth of C. albicans. The candidacidal activity data of synthetic histatin 5 were comparable to the values of the native histatin 5 isolated from parotid saliva and those reported previously, although the assay system used and the strains examined were different. The C16 fragment was as active as the whole peptide itself, whereas the N16 fragment was far less active than C14, suggesting that the sequence at the C-terminal is important for its fungicidal activity. An increase in the chain length of the C-terminal sequence from 12 to 16 residues increased the candidacidal activity, thereby indicating that a peptide chain length of at least 12 residues is necessary to elicit optimum biological activity. The CD spectra of these linear peptides showed that they are structurally more flexible, and they adopt different conformations depending on the solvent environment. CD studies provided evidence that histatin 5 and the longer fragments, C16, N16, and C14 preferred alpha-helical conformations in non-aqueous solvents such as trifluoroethanol and methanol, while in water and pH 7.4 phosphate buffers, they favored random coil structures. The shorter sequences seemed to adopt either turn structures or unordered structures both in aqueous and non-aqueous solutions. It appears that the sequence at the C-terminal of histatin 5 with a minimum chain length of 14 residues and alpha-helical conformation are the important structural requirements for appreciable candidacidal activity."

Using conventional analysis techniques, including 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectroscopy and negative ion fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy, the structure of the carbohydrate-containing part of the molecule is determined as: (Sequence: see text). There is uncertainty as to which 2-O-substituted alpha-D-Manp unit is attached the side chain or whether it is distributed between the two units. Some of the structures lack the Galf side chain. The inositol unit is linked to ceramide via a phosphodiester bridge. The major aliphatic components of the ceramide portion were lignoceric acid and sphinganine."
https://openalex.org/W1561793264,"A gene fragment encoding the extracellular domain of the human growth hormone (hGH) receptor from liver was cloned into a plasmid under control of the Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase promoter and the heat-stable enterotoxin (StII) signal peptide sequence. Strains of E. coli expressing properly folded hGH binding protein were identified by blotting colonies with 125I-hGH. The E. coli strain capable of highest expression (KS330) secreted 10 to 20 mg/liter of culture of properly processed and folded hGH receptor fragment into the periplasmic space. The protein was purified to near homogeneity in 70 to 80% yield (in tens of milligram amounts) using ammonium sulfate precipitation, hGH affinity chromatography, and gel filtration. The unglycosylated extracellular domain of the hGH receptor has virtually identical binding properties compared to its natural glycosylated counterpart isolated from human serum, suggesting glycosylation is not important for binding of hGH. The extracellular binding domain codes for 7 cysteines, and we show that six of them form three disulfide bonds. Peptide mapping studies show these disulfides are paired sequentially to produce short loops (10-15 residues long) as follows: Cys38-Cys48, Cys83-Cys94, and Cys108-Cys122. Cys241 is unpaired, and mutagenic analysis shows that the extreme carboxyl end of the receptor fragment (including Cys241) is not essential for folding or binding of the protein to hGH. High level expression of this receptor binding domain and its homologs in E. coli will greatly facilitate their detailed biophysical and structural analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1547330783,"We have purified yeast DNA polymerase II to near homogeneity as a 145-kDa polypeptide. During the course of this purification we have detected and purified a novel form of DNA polymerase II that we designate as DNA polymerase II. The most highly purified preparations of DNA polymerase II are composed of polypeptides with molecular masses of 200, 80, 34, 30, and 29 kDa. Immunological analysis and peptide mapping of DNA polymerase II and the 200-kDa subunit of DNA polymerase II indicate that the 145-kDa DNA polymerase II polypeptide is derived from the 200-kDa polypeptide of DNA polymerase II. Activity gel analysis shows that the 145- and the 200-kDa polypeptides have catalytic function. The polypeptides present in the DNA polymerase II preparation copurify with the polymerase activity with a constant relative stoichiometry during chromatography over five columns and co-sediment with the activity during glycerol gradient centrifugation, suggesting that this complex may be a holoenzyme form of DNA polymerase II. Both forms of DNA polymerase II possess a 3'-5' exonuclease activity that remains tightly associated with the polymerase activity during purification. DNA polymerase II is similar to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-independent form of mammalian DNA polymerase delta in its resistance to butylpheny-dGTP, template specificity, stimulation of polymerase and exonuclease activity by KCl, and high processivity. Although calf thymus PCNA does not stimulate the activity of DNA polymerase II on poly(dA):oligo(dT), possibly due to the limited length of the template, the high processivity of yeast DNA polymerase II on this template can be further increased by the addition of PCNA, suggesting that conditions may exist for interactions between PCNA and yeast DNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1532455251,"Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PI-TPs) catalyze the transfer of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine between membranes in vitro. However, the in vivo function of these proteins is unknown. In this paper, we use a combined biochemical and genetic approach to determine the importance of PI-TP in vivo. An oligonucleotide based on the amino-terminal sequence of the PI-TP from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to screen a yeast genomic library for the gene encoding PI-TP (PIT1 gene). Positive clones showed overproduction of transfer activities and transfer protein in the 100,000 x g supernatants. The 5' terminus of the PIT1 gene correlates with the predicted codons for residues 3-30 of the determined protein sequence. A putative intron is located between the codons for residues 2 and 3 of the protein sequence. The codons for the first two amino acids of the protein and the presumptive initiation methionine precede the intron. Tetrad analysis of a heterozygous diploid (PIT1/pit1::LEU2) revealed that the PIT1 gene is essential for cell growth. Nonviable spores could be rescued by transformation of the above diploid prior to sporulation, with a plasmid-borne copy of the wild type gene."

https://openalex.org/W1912879893,"Comparative analyses of a number of secretory proteins processed by eukaryotic and prokaryotic signal peptidases have identified a strongly conserved feature regarding the residues positioned -3 and -1 relative to the cleavage site. These 2 residues of the signal peptide are thought to constitute a recognition site for the processing enzyme and are usually amino acids with small, neutral side chains. It was shown previously that the substitution of aspartic acid for alanine at -3 of the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) signal peptide blocked maturation by signal peptidase I but had no noticeable effect or MBP translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane of its biological activity. This identified an excellent system in which to undertake a detailed investigation of the structural requirements and limitations for the cleavage site. In vitro mutagenesis was used to generate 14 different amino acid substitutions at -3 and 13 different amino acid substitutions at -1 of the MBP signal peptide. The maturation of the mutant precursor species expressed in vivo was examined. Overall, the results obtained agreed fairly well with statistically derived models of signal peptidase I specificity, except that cysteine was found to permit efficient processing when present at either -3 and -1, and threonine at -1 resulted in inefficient processing. Interestingly, it was found that substitutions at -1 which blocked processing at the normal cleavage site redirected processing, with varying efficiencies, to an alternate site in the signal peptide represented by the Ala-X-Ala sequence at positions -5 to -3. The substitution of aspartic acid for alanine at -5 blocked processing at this alternate site but not the normal site. The amino acids occupying the -5 and -3 positions in many other prokaryotic signal peptides also have the potential for constituting alternate processing sites. This appears to represent another example of redundant information contained within the signal peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2010683202,"Group II intron bI1, the first intron of the COB gene in the mitochondria of S. cerevisiae, is able to self-splice in vitro with the basic pathway similar to nuclear pre-mRNA splicing. We show that incubation of the intron lariat with ligated exons bE1 and bE2 leads to a complete reversal of the splicing reaction. The integration of the intron into the ligated exons is correct; the reconstituted preRNA of the reverse reaction can undergo a self-splicing reaction anew. When incubated with a foreign RNA species bearing a sequence motif that is complementary to exon binding site 1, the lariat can integrate into this RNA with the position of insertion immediately downstream of this sequence. This result implies that transposition of group II introns on the RNA level by reversal of the splicing reaction is, in principle, conceivable."

https://openalex.org/W1581413625,"The arginine residue at position 308 in the Flp recombinase corresponds to the only invariant arginine within the Int family of recombinases. Alterations of this residue result in Flp variants that retain substrate recognition, but form weaker protein-DNA complexes than wild type Flp. Furthermore, their DNA cleavage activity is significantly diminished. A conservative change of R308K results in a functional Flp variant; however, this protein has a lowered temperature optimum for recombination. The Arg-308 mutants can be stabilized on the DNA substrate through cooperativity with a partner Flp mutant that is tight binding. Thus, interactions between Flp monomers must be a relevant feature of the normal recombination reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1869883584,"We describe the cooperativity in the biotin binding of streptavidin. We have developed an electrophoretic method which can separate streptavidin molecules with bound biotin from those without biotin. In 6 M urea, the electrophoretic mobility of streptavidin in polyacrylamide gels becomes significantly faster upon biotin binding. When streptavidin was titrated with biotin, only two major bands were observed on the gel, consisting of streptavidin molecules without bound biotin and those saturated with biotin. The change in mobility is due partly to the negative charge of the bound biotin, but it must reflect conformational changes of the protein molecule associated with biotin binding. Gel filtration chromatography showed that the streptavidin molecule dissociates into two subunit dimers in the presence of 6 M urea. These results suggest that the biotin binding by the streptavidin subunit dimer is cooperative and that some communication must exist between the two subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2169608732,"We have investigated the recombinase activity of recA441 protein by comparing its in vitro DNA strand exchange activity to that of wild-type recA protein. Consistent with its proficiency in recombination in vivo, recA441 protein is able to catalyze the in vitro exchange of a circular single-stranded DNA molecule for a homologous strand in a linear double-stranded DNA molecule. Under conditions optimal for wild-type recA protein, the rates of joint molecule formation are the same for the two recA proteins, but the wild-type protein converts these intermediate species to gapped circular heteroduplex DNA product molecules more rapidly than recA441 protein. In the recA441 protein reaction, joint molecules are instead converted to extensive homology-dependent DNA networks via presumed reinitiation reactions. Under some conditions, the DNA strand exchange activity of recA441 protein is enhanced relative to the wild-type. These conditions include when single-stranded DNA.SSB protein (where SSB is Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein) complexes are formed prior to the addition of recA protein, at low magnesium ion concentration in the presence of spermidine, and at low ATP concentrations. Under the conditions examined, recA441 protein competes more effectively with SSB protein for DNA-binding sites; thus, the differences between the strand exchange activities of the wild-type and recA441 proteins can be attributed to this enhanced ability in SSB protein competition."
https://openalex.org/W1594652840,"Facilitated diffusion along nontarget DNA is employed by numerous DNA-interactive proteins to locate specific targets. Until now, the biological significance of DNA scanning has remained elusive. T4 endonuclease V is a DNA repair enzyme which scans nontarget DNA and processively incises DNA at the site of pyrimidine dimers which are produced by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. In this study we tested the hypothesis that there exists a direct correlation between the degree of processivity of wild type and mutant endonuclease V molecules and the degree of enhanced UV resistance which is conferred to repair-deficient Eshcerichia coli. This was accomplished by first creating a series of endonuclease V mutants whose in vitro catalytic activities were shown to be very similar to that of the wild type enzyme. However, when the mechanisms by which these enzymes search nontarget DNA for its substrate were analyzed in vitro and in vivo, the mutants displayed varying degrees of nontarget DNA scanning ranging from being nearly as processive as wild type to randomly incising dimers within the DNA population. The ability of these altered endonuclease V molecules to enhance UV survival in DNA repair-deficient E. coli then was assessed. The degree of enhanced UV survival was directly correlated with the level of facilitated diffusion. This is the first conclusive evidence directly relating a reduction of in vivo facilitated diffusion with a change in an observed phenotype. These results support the assertion that the mechanisms which DNA-interactive proteins employ in locating their target sites are of biological significance."
https://openalex.org/W1586020973,"We have investigated the mechanism of transcription termination by T7 RNA polymerase using templates encoding variants of the transcription-termination structure (attenuator) of the regulatory region of the threonine (thr) operon of Escherichia coli. The thr attenuator comprises the following two distinct structural elements: a G + C-rich inverted repeat, which encodes an RNA hairpin structure, and A + T-rich regions, one of which contains a continuous sequence of template deoxyadenosine residues within which the transcription terminates. Fourteen attenuator variants were analyzed and we find that not only the hairpin structure itself but also its sequence influences termination. Furthermore, the formation of a hairpin in the RNA encoded by the A + T-rich regions of the attenuator is not mandatory for termination. A series of seven deletion variants that successively shorten the deoxyadenosine tract in the attenuator template were also analyzed. Results from these experiments indicate that complete readthrough occurs when there are four or fewer deoxyadenosine residues. With 5 template deoxyadenosine residues there is 5% termination increasing to 32% with 8 deoxyadenosines, the value produced by the wild-type attenuator. In addition, a comparison with E. coli RNA polymerase shows that T7 RNA polymerase requires a more perfect region of dyad symmetry and a longer deoxyadenosine tract than does the bacterial enzyme to terminate with maximum efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1521406343,"The precursor of the chloroplast protein ferredoxin from Silene pratensis was expressed in Escherichia coli. When a low copy number plasmid was used, the preferredoxin level was low, and the protein was soluble. The expression level was increased by using a high copy number plasmid. In protease-deficient cells transformed with the latter plasmid, the preferredoxin accumulated up to 1% of total protein, and it was found in insoluble aggregates. These aggregates were dissolved in 4 M urea, and the protein was purified to homogeneity. Amino-terminal sequencing confirmed the amino acid sequence as deduced from the copy DNA. However, the first methionine residue of the expected sequence was absent in E. coli. The purified precursor was readily imported by isolated chloroplasts and processed to the mature size."
https://openalex.org/W1499525134,"RAS2 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes post-translational modifications involving methyl esterification and palmitic acid addition, resulting in their association with the plasma membrane. In this paper, we provide evidence that two kinds of proteolytic events accompany the biosynthesis. This is shown by separating and characterizing three intracellular forms of RAS2 protein: precursor, intermediate, and mature (fatty acid-acylated) forms. N-Terminal sequencing has revealed that all three forms start with proline, which is the second amino acid expected from the RAS2 gene sequence. Thus, the first methionine is removed very early during the biosynthesis. Isolation and sequencing of C-terminal peptides indicate that three C-terminal amino acids present in the precursor form are removed in the intermediate and in the fatty acid acylated forms. C-Terminal proteolysis appears to accompany methyl esterification, since the methylation occurs with the intermediate and the fatty acid-acylated forms, but not with the precursor. Palmitic acid is identified as the major fatty acid attached to the fatty acid-acylated form."
https://openalex.org/W1577153977,"The processes of transcription and posttranscription are assumed to proceed in close association with the nuclear matrix. In this study we demonstrated that Tat, the trans-activating protein from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), binds both to the TAR region of the nascent HIV mRNAs and the nuclear matrix with high affinity. Both North/Western blotting experiments and nitrocellulose binding studies revealed that Tat binds with an association constant (K alpha) of approximately 1 x 10(9) M-1 to the TAR segment of HIV RNA; binding of Tat to this sequence which is present between position 32 and 82 downstream from the TATA box was also confirmed by gel retardation assays. Binding of Tat to TAR only occurs if the loop segment in the proposed stem-loop secondary structure of HIV leader mRNA is present. Likewise, Tat binds to the nuclear matrix with a K alpha of 7.5 x 10(7) M-1. The number of binding sites has been estimated to be 2 x 10(8)/micrograms of matrix protein, corresponding to 4 x 10(3) sites/nucleus. Tat displays its bimodal function only in the presence of Zn2+ ions. In vitro transcription experiments, using HIV-1 infected nuclei, demonstrate that beyond the TAR-region HIV RNA synthesis occurs only in the presence of Tat. Present studies indicate that Tat may function as a linker by binding of nascent HIV RNAs to the nuclear matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2418815503,"Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase from Escherichia coli uses a pyruvate group as the enzyme cofactor (Satre, M., and Kennedy, E. P. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 479-483). Comparison of the DNA sequence of the psd gene with the partial amino acid sequence of the mature gene product suggests that the two nonidentical subunits of the mature enzyme are formed by cleavage of a proenzyme resulting in the conversion of Ser-254 to an amino-terminal pyruvate residue (Li, Q.-X., and Dowhan, W. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 11516-11522). The cleavage of the wild-type proenzyme occurs rapidly with a half-time on the order of 2 min. When Ser-254 is changed to cysteine (S254C), threonine (S254T), or alanine (S254A) by site-directed mutagenesis, the rate of processing of the proenzyme and the production of the functional enzyme are drastically affected. Proenzymes with S254C or S254T are cleaved with a half-time of around 2-4 h while the S254A proenzyme does not undergo processing. The reduced processing rate for the mutant proenzymes is consistent with less of the functional enzyme being made. Mutants encoding the S254C and S254T protein produce 16 and 2%, respectively, of the activity of the wild-type allele but can still complement a temperature-sensitive mutant in the psd locus. There is no detectable activity or complementation observed with the S254A protein. These results are consistent with the hydroxyl group of Ser-254 playing a critical role in the cleavage of the peptide bond between Gly-253 and Ser-254 of the prophosphatidylserine decarboxylase and support the mechanism proposed by Snell and coworkers (Recsei and Snell (1984) Annul Rev. Biochem. 53, 357-387) for the formation of the prosthetic group of pyruvate-dependent decarboxylases."
https://openalex.org/W1560130646,"The classical scheme involving inositol phospholipid breakdown by phospholipase C as the sole source of diacylglycerol (DAG) has recently been challenged by evidence that phosphatidylcholine (PC) is an alternative source. In synaptic membranes of canine cerebral cortex, cholinergic agonists caused rapid accumulation of [3H]phosphatidic acid (PA) from [3H]PC within 15 s, whereas [3H]DAG formation showed a transient lag period before becoming elevated and then exceeding the amount of [3H]PA. Additional evidence shows that DAG is produced from PC by the action of phospholipase D to yield PA, which is further dephosphorylated to DAG by PA phosphatase. Our results indicate that this muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-regulated PC phospholipase D-PA phosphatase pathway may be a novel mechanism in cell signal transduction processes for activation of protein kinase C in brain."
https://openalex.org/W1482388811,A 138-kDa nuclear protein was identified from HeLa cell extracts as a factor which binds to a previously described 20-base pair cis element located in the intron I of the c-myc gene. This myc intron factor (MIF) binds to the wild type c-myc sequence but does not bind under similar conditions to c-myc from Burkitt's lymphoma which contain point mutations in this binding region. We have demonstrated that the 138-kDa MIF is a phosphoprotein and that treatment of the purified MIF with potato acid phosphatase abolished binding to its 20-base pair c-myc recognition sequence; binding activity was protected by inclusion of phosphatase inhibitors. These results suggest that phosphorylation is required for the specific DNA-MIF interaction in vitro and that the phosphorylation state of MIF may be an important factor in controlling c-myc expression in vivo.
https://openalex.org/W1592746453,"The active site sequence of T4 thioredoxin, Cys-Val-Tyr-Cys, has been modified in two positions to Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys to mimic that of Escherichia coli thioredoxin. The two point mutants Cys-Gly-Tyr-Cys and Cys-Val-Pro-Cys have also been constructed. The mutant proteins have similar reaction rates with T4 ribonucleotide reductase as has the wild-type T4 thioredoxin. Mutant T4 thioredoxins with Pro instead of Tyr at position 16 in the active site sequence have three to four times lower apparent KM with E. coli ribonucleotide reductase than wild-type T4 thioredoxin. The KM values for these mutant proteins which do not have Tyr in position 16 are thus closer to E. coli thioredoxin than to the wild-type T4 thioredoxin. The bulky tyrosine side chain probably prevents proper interactions to E. coli ribonucleotide reductase. Also the redox potentials of these two mutant thioredoxins are lower than that of the wild-type T4 thioredoxin and are thereby more similar to the redox potential of E. coli thioredoxin. Mutations in position 15 behave more or less like the wild-type protein. The kinetic parameters with E. coli thioredoxin reductase are similar for wild-type and mutant T4 thioredoxins except that the apparent kcat is lower for the mutant protein with Pro instead of Tyr in position 16. The active site sequence of T4 thioredoxin has also been changed to Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys to mimic that of glutaredoxins. This change does not markedly alter the reaction rate of the mutant protein with T4 ribonucleotide reductase or E. coli thioredoxin reductase, but the redox potential is lower for this mutant protein than for wild-type T4 thioredoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1515300281,"The double mutant, Val-177/Asn-322, was investigated with regard to its ability to transport H+ and galactosides. In downhill lactose transport assays, the wild-type strain had a Km value for lactose uptake of 0.9 mM and a Vmax of 0.65 mumol lactose/min.mg protein while the mutant had a significantly higher Km value of 1.9 mM but a similar Vmax of 0.49 mumol/min.mg protein. In spite of its moderate ability to transport lactose downhill, the Val-177/Asn-322 mutant exhibited the striking property of being completely defective in the uphill accumulation of lactose or methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Direct measurements of H+ transport, however, showed that the mutant's defect in active accumulation is not due to a defect in the ability to transport H+ with lactose or methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. The Val-177/Asn-322 mutant strain had a H+:lactose stoichiometry of 0.84 which was similar to that measured in the wild-type strain (0.68). These results are discussed with regard to the role His-322 plays in H+ transport, active accumulation of sugars, and sugar recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1550186110,"The olfactory neuroepithelium is the principal site of interaction for airborne molecules, mainly odorants, in the organism. The presence of an active cytochrome P-450-dependent oxidative metabolism in this tissue has not yet been studied as well as the hepatic cytochrome P-450-dependent oxidations. In this report, we describe cytochrome P-450olf1 (IIG1), a P-450 gene expressed at high levels uniquely in the olfactory epithelium. By Southern analysis and genomic DNA cloning, we demonstrate that a single copy of the P-450olf1 gene is present in the rat genome and contains 9 exons. We conclude that rat P-450IIG1 is a single gene subfamily. P-450olf1 gene expression was activated after birth in both male and female Sprague-Dawley rats and remained active in adult olfactory epithelium. A first maximum level of expression was reached around postnatal day 21. The coincidence between the temporal gene activation of P-450olf1 and the postnatal increase in the sensitivity of olfactory response to odorants is consistent with a potential role of this enzyme in olfactory function."
https://openalex.org/W1550216293,"Ultraviolet irradiation of EcoRII methyltransferase in the presence of its substrate, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), results in the formation of a stable enzyme-substrate adduct. This adduct can be demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after irradiation of the enzyme in the presence of either [methyl-3H]AdoMet or [35S]AdoMet. The extent of photolabeling is low. Under optimal conditions, 4.5 pmol of [3H]AdoMet is incorporated into 100 pmol of enzyme. Use of the 8-azido derivative of AdoMet as the photolabeling substrate increases the incorporation by approximately 2-fold. However, this adduct, unlike the one formed with AdoMet, is not stable when treated with thiol reagents or precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. A catalytically active conformation of the enzyme is needed for AdoMet photolabeling. Heat-inactivated enzyme or proteins for which AdoMet is not a substrate or cofactor do not undergo adduct formation. Two other methyltransferases, MspI and dam methylases are also shown to form adducts with AdoMet upon UV irradiation. The binding constant of the EcoRII methyltransferase for AdoMet determined with the photolabeling reaction is 11 microM, which is similar to the binding constant of 9 microM previously reported (Friedman, S. (1986) Nucleic Acids Res. 14, 4543-4556). The AdoMet analogs S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (Ki = 0.83 microM) and sinefungin (Ki = 4.3 microM) are effective inhibitors of photolabeling, whereas S-adenosyl-D-homocysteine (Ki = 46 microM) is a poor inhibitor. These experiments indicate that AdoMet becomes covalently bound at the AdoMet-binding site on the enzyme molecule. The EcoRII methyltransferase-AdoMet adduct is very stable and could be used to identify the AdoMet-binding site on DNA methyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W1539209825,"The structure of the phosphorylated form of isocitrate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli has been solved and refined to an R-factor of 16.9% at 2.5-A resolution. Comparison with the structure of the dephosphorylated enzyme shows that there are no large scale conformational changes and that small conformational changes are highly localized around the site of phosphorylation at serine 113. Tyrosine 160 rotates by 15 degrees, and there is a local rearrangement of water structure. There is an 0.2-A net movement of loop 230-234, and side chain shifts of 0.2 A root mean square for isoleucine 159 and lysine 199. The lack of large conformational changes, the observation of a possible isocitrate binding site close to serine 113, and the demonstration that the phosphorylated enzyme is unable to bind isocitrate suggest that this enzyme is inactivated by a direct electrostatic interaction between the substrate and the serine phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1533531703,"Clathrin light chains are extended molecules located along the proximal segment of each of the three heavy chain legs of a clathrin trimer. All mammalian light chains share a central segment with 10 repeated heptad motifs believed to mediate the interaction with clathrin heavy chains. In order to test this model in more detail, we have expressed intact rat liver clathrin light chain LCB3 in Escherichia coli and find that it binds tightly to calf clathrin heavy chains. Using a set of expressed truncated mutants of LCB3, we show that the presence of seven to eight heptads is indeed necessary for a successful interaction. More extensive deletions of the central segment completely abolish the ability to bind to heavy chains. Neither the amino- nor the carboxyl-terminal domain is essential for binding, but competition experiments show that the presence of the carboxyl-terminal domain does enhance the interaction with heavy chains."
https://openalex.org/W1659260557,"A major proline carrier in Escherichia coli encoded by the putP gene mediates proline/Na+ or Li+ symport. Proline carrier mutants with altered cation specificity were obtained by mutagenesis with nitrous acid in vitro of a plasmid carrying the wild-type putP gene. Two mutant strains harboring plasmid pMOP4135 and pMOP4141 could transport proline efficiently only in the presence of an increased concentration of sodium ion. Mutations of these plasmids, putP4135 and putP4141, caused reduction of affinity for Na+ of proline transport and binding, without remarkable change in the affinity for proline or in production of the carriers. Consistent with the lower affinity of the putP4141 carrier for Na+, the mutant carrier was supersensitive to N-ethylmaleimide inhibition. The pH dependence of proline binding was also changed in these mutant carriers. The lesions of putP4135 and putP4141 were located in the N-terminal part of the putP gene (ClaI-PvuII fragment) by in vitro recombination and subsequent examination of the phenotype of the transformants. DNA sequencing of these fragments revealed one base alteration of G to A at nucleotides 299 and 656 in pMOP4141 and pMOP4135, respectively, which corresponded to amino acid changes from Gly22 to glutamic acid and Cys141 to tyrosine, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1887074654,"In the absence of cyclic AMP, the Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor protein (CAP) binds without detectable sequence specificity to restriction fragments containing lac and crp promoter sequences. Under standard conditions (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), our estimates of the equilibrium constant and cooperativity parameter for complex formation are 114,000 +/- 1400 M-1 and 1.3 +/- 0.8, respectively. Thus, this interaction lacks the substantial cooperativity previously reported for CAP binding to genomic DNAs. Using the electrophoresis mobility shift assay, we find that complexes of increasing CAP content differ by a highly uniform mobility decrement. This result is most consistent with a binding mode in which little or no DNA bending occurs. The ability of CAP to distinguish between restriction fragments and genomic DNA, shown by the difference in binding cooperativity, suggests the existence of previously unsuspected DNA sequences or structures that modulate its binding cooperativity."
https://openalex.org/W35296227,"N alpha-Acetylation is the most frequently occurring chemical modification of the alpha-NH2 group of eukaryotic proteins and was believed until now to be catalyzed by a single N alpha-acetyltransferase. The transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to the alpha-amino group of five NH2-terminal residues (serine, alanine, methionine, glycine, and threonine) in proteins accounts for approximately 95% of acetylated residues. We have found that a crude lysate from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant (aaa1) deficient in N alpha-acetyltransferase activity can effectively transfer an acetyl group to peptides containing NH2-terminal methionine but not to serine or alanine. This methionine N alpha-acetyltransferase has been extensively purified, and this purified enzyme can selectively transfer an acetyl group to various model peptides containing an NH2-terminal methionine residue and a penultimate aspartyl, asparaginyl, or glutamyl residue. Such specificity of N alpha-acetylation of methionine has been previously observed based on the analysis of eukaryotic protein sequences (Persson, B., Flinta, C., Heijne, G., and Jornvall, H. (1985) Eur. J. Biochem. 152, 523-527; Arfin, S.M., and Bradshaw, R. A. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 7979-7984). The indentification of this methionine N alpha-acetyltransferase provides an explanation as to why two distinct classes of N alpha-acetylated proteins exist in nature: (i) those whose initiator methionine is acetylated and (ii) those whose penultimate residue is acetylated after cleavage of the initiator methionine."
https://openalex.org/W1614929635,"Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) catalyzes the intravascular synthesis of lipoprotein cholesteryl esters by converting cholesterol and lecithin to cholesteryl ester and lysolecithin. LCAT is unique in that it catalyzes sequential reactions within a single polypeptide sequence, a phospholipase A2 reaction followed by a transacylation reaction. In this report we find that LCAT mediates a partial reverse reaction, the transacylation of lipoprotein cholesteryl oleate, in whole plasma and in a purified, reconstituted system. As a result of the reverse transacylation reaction, a linear accumulation of [3H]cholesterol occurred during incubations of plasma containing high density lipoprotein labeled with [3H]cholesteryl oleate. When high density lipoprotein labeled with cholesteryl [14C]oleate was also included in the incubation the labeled fatty acyl moiety remained in the cholesteryl [14C]oleate pool showing that the formation of labeled cholesterol did not result from hydrolysis of the doubly labeled cholesteryl esters. The rate of release of [3H]cholesterol was only about 10% of the forward rate of esterification of cholesterol using partially purified human LCAT and was approximately 7% in whole monkey plasma. Therefore, net production of cholesterol via the reverse LCAT reaction would not occur. [3H]Cholesterol production from [3H]cholesteryl oleate was almost completely inhibited by a final concentration of 1.4 mM 5,5'-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) during incubation with either purified LCAT or whole plasma. Addition of excess lysolecithin to the incubation system did not result in the formation of [14C]oleate-labeled lecithin, showing that the reverse reaction found here for LCAT was limited to the last step of the reaction. To explain these results we hypothesize that LCAT forms a [14C]oleate enzyme thioester intermediate after its attack on the cholesteryl oleate molecule. Formation of this intermediate allows [3H]cholesterol to be liberated from the enzyme by exchange with unlabeled cholesterol of plasma lipoproteins. The liberated [3H]cholesterol thereby becomes available for reesterification by LCAT as indicated by its appearance as newly synthesized cholesteryl linoleate."
https://openalex.org/W1556296914,"We have labeled a template primer-dependent substrate deoxynucleoside triphosphate binding domain in Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I using an affinity labeling analogue of dATP, the 5'-fluorosulfonylbenzoyldeoxyadenosine (FSBdA). Using enzyme-template primer complex as a test system, we find that FSBdA-mediated inactivation occurs only when the template in the enzyme-template primer complex is poly(dT).(dA)10. A ribonucleotide analogue, 5'-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) is not an effective inactivator under these conditions. In the absence of template primer, however, deoxyribonanalogue (FSBdA) irreversibly inactivates polymerase activity with characteristics similar to those reported for FSBA (Pandey, V.N., and Modak, M.J. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6068). Binding stoichiometric studies in the presence and absence of template primer revealed that only 1 mol of FSBdA is incorporated per mol of enzyme which results in complete inactivation. The site of FSBdA action was investigated by comparative tryptic peptide mapping, followed by amino acid composition analysis of the modified peptide. Arginine 682 was found to be the target of FSBdA reactivity. We therefore conclude that the domain containing Arg-682 plays a major role in template-dependent dNTP binding and polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W1597580632,"The formation of new membrane vesicles normally occurs during eukaryotic organellogenesis and maturation of bacteriophage PM2. This virus was studied as a simple model for membrane morphogenesis. Previous biochemical and genetic studies suggest that a major structural protein of PM2, sp6.6, is an integral membrane protein involved in viral membrane morphogenesis. To establish the necessity of sp6.6 in membrane formation, restriction fragments of PM2 that contained the sp6.6 coding sequence were cloned into several plasmid vectors for expression in Escherichia coli. A construction in pBR322 containing two HindIII fragments of PM2 DNA caused production of intracellular membrane vesicles of the same size as those produced in the course of natural infection of Alteromonas espejiana. Similar results were obtained with a smaller construct of HindIII fragments in the plasmid vector pPL-lambda. Expression of sp6.6 was detected via incorporation of 35S-labeled methionine after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and with a specific rabbit antiserum on immunoblots. Other constructs did not produce recognizable vesicles or sp6.6. These results are the first to suggest that a hydrophobic membrane protein can cause development of new membrane structure."
https://openalex.org/W1577290863,"DNA polymerase alpha was studied in a direct gap-filling assay. Using a defined template, DNA synthesis was primed from the M13 17-mer universal primer and blocked by an oligonucleotide hybridized 56 nucleotides downstream of the primer. DNA polymerase alpha filled this gap to completion. A time course of the reaction showed that in 50% of the substrate molecules, gaps were filled to completion within 10 min. In another 35% of the molecules the final nucleotide was lacking after 10 min. This nucleotide was added at a reduced rate, and was not incorporated into all of the molecules even after 6 h. The reduced rate of incorporation of the final nucleotide is reflected in an increased Km for de novo incorporation of one nucleotide at a single nucleotide gap (0.7 microM), as opposed to the Km for de novo incorporation of one nucleotide into singly primed M13 DNA (0.18 microM). DNA polymerase alpha purified from murine cells infected with the parvovirus minute virus of mice, and HeLa cell DNA polymerase alpha 2, exhibited the same kinetics of gap filling as did DNA polymerase alpha purified from uninfected Ehrlich ascites murine tumor cells. T4 DNA polymerase filled gaps to completion in this assay. Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment quantitatively displaced the downstream oligonucleotide, and extended nascent DNA chains for an additional 100 nucleotides. Nicks and single-nucleotide gaps produced in gap-filling reactions by murine DNA polymerase alpha and T4 DNA polymerase were sealed by T4 DNA ligase."
https://openalex.org/W1607120100,"Homopolymeric dAn.dTn sequences, where n is 4 or greater, have special properties leading to increased duplex stability and DNA bending. The lacUV5 promoter was used to examine the functional consequences of changing the -10 TATAAT consensus sequence to the sequence TAAAAT. The transversion mutation at the underlined site was accomplished with site-directed mutagenesis using translation termination as the selection procedure. For free DNA, structural differences at the 5' and 3' junction regions of the dA4.dT4 tract can be readily detected by DNase I digestion. However, site binding by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase appeared unaltered by the TAAAAT sequence since identical DNase I footprints were obtained for the lacUV5 and mutant promoters. Binding competition studies under different ionic strengths revealed a significant reduction in mutant promoter open complex formation relative to the lacUV5 promoter. Mutant promoter open complexes also dissociated faster and to a greater extent than the corresponding lacUV5 promoter open complexes when challenged with heparin or a combination of heparin and increased KCl concentration. Consequently, mutant promoter open complexes appear less stable than lacUV5 promoter open complexes."
