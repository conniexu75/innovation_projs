https://openalex.org/W2080148317,"Individual carbon nanotubes are like minute bits of string, and many trillions of these invisible strings must be assembled to make useful macroscopic articles. We demonstrated such assembly at rates above 7 meters per minute by cooperatively rotating carbon nanotubes in vertically oriented nanotube arrays (forests) and made 5-centimeter-wide, meter-long transparent sheets. These self-supporting nanotube sheets are initially formed as a highly anisotropic electronically conducting aerogel that can be densified into strong sheets that are as thin as 50 nanometers. The measured gravimetric strength of orthogonally oriented sheet arrays exceeds that of sheets of high-strength steel. These nanotube sheets have been used in laboratory demonstrations for the microwave bonding of plastics and for making transparent, highly elastomeric electrodes; planar sources of polarized broad-band radiation; conducting appliqués; and flexible organic light-emitting diodes."

Pelagibacter ubique , the first cultured member of this clade, has the smallest genome and encodes the smallest number of predicted open reading frames known for a free-living microorganism. In contrast to parasitic bacteria and archaea with small genomes, P. ubique has complete biosynthetic pathways for all 20 amino acids and all but a few cofactors. P. ubique has no pseudogenes, introns, transposons, extrachromosomal elements, or inteins; few paralogs; and the shortest intergenic spacers yet observed for any cell."
https://openalex.org/W2066753890,"The extensive somatic diversification of immune receptors is a hallmark of higher vertebrates. However, whether molecular diversity contributes to immune protection in invertebrates is unknown. We present evidence that Drosophila immune-competent cells have the potential to express more than 18,000 isoforms of the immunoglobulin (Ig)-superfamily receptor Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam). Secreted protein isoforms of Dscam were detected in the hemolymph, and hemocyte-specific loss of Dscam impaired the efficiency of phagocytic uptake of bacteria, possibly due to reduced bacterial binding. Importantly, the molecular diversity of Dscam transcripts generated through a mechanism of alternative splicing is highly conserved across major insect orders, suggesting an unsuspected molecular complexity of the innate immune system of insects."

https://openalex.org/W1981372238,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) with protein covalently attached to 5' strand termini are formed by Spo11 to initiate meiotic recombination. The Spo11 protein must be removed for the DSB to be repaired, but the mechanism for removal is unclear. Here we show that meiotic DSBs in budding yeast are processed by endonucleolytic cleavage that releases Spo11 attached to an oligonucleotide with a free 3'-OH. Two discrete Spo11-oligonucleotide complexes were found in equal amounts, differing with respect to the length of the bound DNA. We propose that these forms arise from different spacings of strand cleavages flanking the DSB, with every DSB processed asymmetrically. Thus, the ends of a single DSB may be biochemically distinct at or before the initial processing step-much earlier than previously thought. SPO11-oligonucleotide complexes were identified in extracts of mouse testis, indicating that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Oligonucleotide-topoisomerase II complexes were also present in extracts of vegetative yeast, although not subject to the same genetic control as for generating Spo11-oligonucleotide complexes. Our findings suggest a general mechanism for repair of protein-linked DSBs."
https://openalex.org/W2138224451,"Several described growth factors influence the proliferation and regeneration of the intestinal epithelium. Using a transgenic mouse model, we identified a human gene, R-spondin1 , with potent and specific proliferative effects on intestinal crypt cells. Human R-spondin1 (hRSpo1) is a thrombospondin domain-containing protein expressed in enteroendocrine cells as well as in epithelial cells in various tissues. Upon injection into mice, the protein induced rapid onset of crypt cell proliferation involving β-catenin stabilization, possibly by a process that is distinct from the canonical Wnt-mediated signaling pathway. The protein also displayed efficacy in a model of chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis and may have therapeutic application in gastrointestinal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2093076064,"Menopause is associated with increased adiposity and greater risk of metabolic disease. In the ovariectomized (OVX) rodent model of menopause, increased adiposity is prevented by estrogen (E2) replacement, reflecting both anorexigenic and potentially metabolic actions of E2. To elucidate metabolic and molecular mechanisms by which E2 regulates fat storage and fat mobilization independently of reduced energy intake, C57 BL/6 mice were ovariectomized, randomized to estrogen (OVX-E2) or control pellet implants (OVX-C), and pairfed for 40 days. E2 treatment was associated with reduced adipose mass and adipocyte size and down-regulation of lipogenic genes in adipocytes under the control of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1c. Adipocytes of OVX-E2 mice contained >3-fold more perilipin protein than adipocytes of pairfed control (OVX) mice, and this difference was associated with enhanced ex vivo lipolytic response to catecholamines and with greater levels of serum-free fatty acids following fasting. As in adipose tissue, E2 decreased the expression of lipogenic genes in liver and skeletal muscle. In the latter, E2 appears to promote the partitioning of free fatty acids toward oxidation and away from triglyceride storage by up-regulating the expression of peroxisome proliferation activator receptor-δ and its downstream targets and also by directly and rapidly activating AMP-activated protein kinase. Thus, novel genomic and non-genomic actions of E2 promote leanness in OVX mice independently of reduced energy intake.

For example, women randomized to hormone replacement therapy in the Women's Health Initiative were leaner, more insulin sensitive, and less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than women randomized to placebo (20Margolis K.L.

These observations suggest an important, beneficial role for estrogen in energy regulation. Moreover, the beneficial metabolic role of estrogen may not be limited to women (21Herrmann B.L.

The molecular and cell-biological mechanisms underlying the metabolic actions of estrogen are poorly understood. Much of our current view of the actions of estrogen on adiposity and metabolism derive from the ovariectomized rodent model of menopause. OVX rodents rapidly become obese and E2 administration prevents the increase in body fat (23Cooke P.S. Naaz A. Exp. Biol. Med.

However, ovariectomy induces hyperphagia in rodents, and this hyperphagia is itself ameliorated by E2 replacement (25Wade G.N. Gray J.M. Bartness T.J. Int. J.

Thus, reduced energy intake contributes to reduced adiposity in E2-treated OVX rodents (OVX-E2). This differential energy intake confounds our elucidation of how and to what extent, reduced adiposity in OVX-E2 rodents reflects estrogen actions on metabolically critical tissues (adipose, liver, and muscle). Employing a pairfeeding paradigm, the present study defines for the first time how estrogen protects against increased adiposity in OVX mice independently of differences in energy intake. We demonstrate that estrogen inhibits lipogenic gene expression, promotes catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes, and stimulates lipid-oxidative pathways in muscle. These metabolic effects reflect the genomic actions of estrogen on SREBP-1c and PPAR-δ-regulated gene expression, as well as novel, non-genomic estrogen actions on AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Animals—Female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Taconic Laboratories (Germantown, NY). All animals were housed in an AAALAC-approved animal facility with 12-h light/dark cycles, given free access to water, and fed standard rodent chow (PROLAB, Syracuse, NY). Bilateral ovariectomy was performed on 10-week-old mice as previously described (30Sullivan Jr., T.R. Karas R.H. Aronovitz M. Faller G.T. Ziar J.P. Smith J.J. O'Donnell Jr., T.F. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 2482-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). After a 7-day recovery, mice were randomized to either placebo pellets (OVX-C) or E2 pellets (OVX-E2) containing 0.25 mg of 17β-estradiol released over 60 days (Innovation Research, Sarasota, FL) (n = 4 and 5, respectively). This supplementation protocol re-establishes and maintains circulating physiological levels of estrogen in ovariectomized mice (31Karas R.H. Schulten H. Pare G. Aronovitz M.J. Ohlsson C. Gustafsson J.A. Mendelsohn M.E. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). OVX-C mice were pair-fed to OVX-E2 mice. To do this, OVX-C mice were individually housed and fed the average food intake of the OVX-E2 group from the previous day. Food intake and body weight were monitored daily. On the day prior to tissue harvest, mice were fed at 16:00 h and food was removed at 20:00 h for an overnight fast. Plasma Collection and Systemic Measures—After 40 days of treatment, blood was obtained from overnight-fasted mice by terminal exsanguination under isoflurane anesthesia. Plasma-free fatty acids (FFA) were measured using a NEFA-C assay kit (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA). Plasma adiponectin was measured by radioimmunoassay and plasma resistin, insulin, and leptin were measured using a mouse adipokine multiplex assay (Linco Diagnostics, St. Charles, MI). Glucose was measured using a Beckman Glucose Analyzer 2 (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Adiposity Index and Fat Pad Weight—Periovarian, perirenal, inguinal subcutaneous, mesenteric, and omental fat pads were excised and weighed. Adiposity index, a quantitative measure of total fat mass, was calculated using the previously described equation (32Gregoire F.M. Zhang Q. Smith S.J. Tong C. Ross D. Lopez H. West D.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E703-E713Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar): adiposity index(%) = (∑ (fat pads)/body weight) × 100. Adipocyte Isolation—Periovarian adipocytes were isolated using collagenase and centrifugation as previously described (33Honnor R.C. Dhillon G.S. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15122-15129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The samples were gassed (5% CO2, 95% O2), capped, and incubated at 37 °C with shaking until digestion was complete (30–40 min). Adipocyte Lipolysis—Adipocytes were aliquoted in triplicate to measure lipolysis under basal (200 nm phenyl isopropyl adenosine) and stimulated (200 nm phenyl isopropyl adenosine + 10 μm epinephrine) conditions. Lipolytic rate was assessed as glycerol released into the media over 3 h using a Free Glycerol Determination kit (Sigma) (34Souza S.C. de Vargas L.M. Yamamoto M.T. Lien P. Franciosa M.D. Moss L.G. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24665-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Lipolysis was quantified “per cell,” “per mg of lipid,” and “per adipocyte surface area.” Adipocyte Number—The number of fat cells per incubation was determined according to previously published methods (35Di Girolamo M. Mendlinger S. Fertig J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1971; 221: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Lipid content (mg/ml) was determined by organic extraction of lipids from isolated adipocytes. Adipocytes were visually sized (100–150 adipocytes per mouse) using a light microscope and a 100-μm ocular micrometer. Cell number was then calculated using measures of lipid concentration and adipocyte diameter (35Di Girolamo M. Mendlinger S. Fertig J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1971; 221: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). C2C12 Culture—Mouse C2C12 myoblasts (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured and differentiated as previously described (36Shih H.H. Tevosian S.G. Yee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4732-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). On day 5, cells were serum-depleted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16 h prior to experiments. 17β-Estradiol and ICI 182,780 were purchased from Sigma and Tocris (Ellisville, MO), respectively. ICI 182,780 was added to the appropriate wells 30 min prior to the addition of E2. Incubations were terminated by addition of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 nm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4. Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of adipocyte lysates for perilipin and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) was performed as previously described (34Souza S.C. de Vargas L.M. Yamamoto M.T. Lien P. Franciosa M.D. Moss L.G. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24665-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The method of Wang et al. (37Wang Y. Sullivan S. Trujillo M. Lee M.J. Schneider S.H. Brolin R.E. Kang Y.H. Werber Y. Greenberg A.S. Fried S.K. Obes. Res. 2003; 11: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was used to quantitatively recover perilipin from the adipocyte fat cake. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies to perilipin A (38Zhang H.H. Souza S.C. Muliro K.V. Kraemer F.B. Obin M.S. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51535-51542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), HSL (a generous gift from Dr. F. A. Kraemer), and β-actin (Sigma), which served as a loading control. Chemiluminescence (Super Signal, Pierce) was quantified by laser densitometry within the linear range of detection. E2-induced phosphorylation of AMPK on threonine 172 was assessed in lysates of mouse skeletal muscle (rectus femoris) and/or C2C12 myocytes following sonication in SDS lysis buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Lysates were electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies against AMPK and phosphorylated AMPK (Cell Signaling, Beverly MA). Real-time PCR—Adipose tissue (perirenal), liver, and muscle (rectus femoris) were dissected, immediately placed in RNAlater (Qiagen, Valencia California), and subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Total RNA was extracted from ∼100 mg of frozen tissue using commercially available kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was quantified by RiboGreen Quantitation Assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using a Reverse Transcription System (Promega). Real-time PCR was performed on each sample in triplicate on an ABI PRISM® 7700 Sequence Detection System in a 20-μl total volume using SYBR® Green PCR Master MIX (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers were designed using Primer Express or from previously published sequences (sequences available on request). Data were analyzed using a comparative critical threshold (Ct) method (39Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar), with the amount of target gene normalized to the average of two endogenous control genes (18 S ribosomal RNA and cyclophilin B). Percent difference was calculated by 2–ΔΔCt. Statistical Analysis—Data are reported as mean ± S.E. and were analyzed by SPSS 10.0.7 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Treatment effects were evaluated by independent T tests of group means using Bonferroni adjustments for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Estrogen Decreases Adiposity and Adipocyte Size in Pairfed Ovariectomized Mice—Estrogen-treated mice (OVX-E2) consumed less food on day 1 (∼30%) as compared with ad libitum fed controls (OVX-C) (Fig. 1A). After day 1, OVX-C received only the amount of food consumed by OVX-E2 mice on the previous day. On day 40, body weights and indices of linear growth (femur length, nasoanal length) were equivalent in OVX and OVX-E2 mice. There was no difference in femur length or nasoanal length, indicating linear growth was not affected by treatment (Fig. 1B). Uterine weight was 10-fold higher in OVX-E2 mice, confirming the efficacy of estrogen treatment in this study (Fig. 1B). Whereas body weights and linear growth were similar, total adiposity was reduced (∼30%) in OVX-E2 mice (Fig. 2A). The associated reductions in adipose mass were observed in both intra-abdominal (perirenal, periovarian, and mesenteric/omental) and subcutaneous depots, although the effect was not statistically significant in subcutaneous fat pads (trend, p = 0.1) (Fig. 2B). Adipose mass reflects both adipocyte number and adipocyte size, the latter a direct manifestation of fat (triglyceride) storage. Decreased adipose tissue mass in OVX-E2 mice was coincident with comparable reductions in mean adipocyte size, suggesting that estrogen effects on adipose mass are mediated in large part by estrogen effects on adipocyte size (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that chronic estrogen treatment promotes smaller adipocytes and reduced adipose mass independently of reduced energy intake in OVX mice. Estrogen Treatment Increases Plasma FFA and Decreases Plasma Glucose in Fasted Mice—Because both estrogen treatment and body fat mass may influence plasma FFA, insulin, and glucose, we measured these metabolites in our fasting animals. Plasma insulin values were not different between groups but OVC-E2 mice had significantly lower serum glucose values as compared with the OVX-C, suggesting differences in glucose/insulin homeostasis (Fig. 3). Interestingly, plasma FFAs in OVX-E2 mice were approximately twice that of OVX-C mice. These results were surprising in light of the fact that elevated circulating FFA are believed to promote peripheral insulin resistance by accumulation of fatty acid derivatives in muscle and liver (40Shulman G.I. Physiology. 2004; 19: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To better understand this apparent paradox, we examined genomic and signaling pathways that may allow peripheral tissues to better accommodate (i.e. utilize) increased circulating FFA (discussed later in the article) as well as potential factors contributing to elevated FFA. Estrogen Treatment Increases Adipocyte Perilipin Expression and Enhances Lipolytic Response to Catecholamines—To determine whether elevated circulating FFA in fasting OVX-E2 mice reflected increased rates of catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis, we measured lipolysis in isolated periovarian adipocytes from OVX-C and OVX-E2 mice in the absence (basal) and presence of the catecholamine, epinephrine. Adipocytes isolated from E2-treated mice demonstrated lower rates of basal lipolysis (in the absence of catecholamines), but an approximate doubling of lipolytic rate following stimulation by epinephrine (Fig. 4A). Similar results were found when lipolysis was expressed per mg of lipid, per adipocyte surface area, and when lipolysis was stimulated by isoproterenol, a selective β-adrenergic receptor agonist (data not shown). Enhanced catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis was not associated with increases in HSL, the predominant lipase in adipocytes (Fig. 4B). However, levels of the lipid droplet-associated protein perilipin were elevated (>3-fold) in adipocytes of OVX-E2 mice. Increased expression of perilipin has been shown to suppress basal lipolysis and increase stimulated lipolysis (41Souza S.C. Muliro K.V. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto M.T. Schaffer J.E. Dallal G.E.

Interestingly, there was no difference in perilipin mRNA expression (Fig. 5), suggesting that perilipin protein expression is regulated, at least in part, post-translationally. These results suggest that chronic E2 treatment enhances the lipolytic rate by enhancing levels of perilipin protein. This enhancement may be related to E2-induced reductions in adipocyte size (37Wang Y. Sullivan S. Trujillo M. Lee M.J. Schneider S.H. Brolin R.E. Kang Y.H. Werber Y. Greenberg A.S. Fried S.K. Obes.

Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Our results do not exclude the demonstrated ability of E2 injection to acutely stimulate lipolysis in vivo (44Darimont C. Delansorne R. Paris J. Ailhaud G. Negrel R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1092-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Estrogen Regulates Adipose Tissue Gene Expression to Prevent TG Accumulation—We used real-time PCR to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism(s) by which E2 decreases adipose tissue mass. These studies revealed dramatic E2-induced down-regulation of genes that promote adipocyte lipid storage (Fig. 5). These included lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which promotes adipocyte uptake of circulating lipids for TG formation, and the lipogenic genes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC-1) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). E2-mediated reductions in ACC-1 and FAS gene expression are likely the result of down-regulation of liver X receptor α (LXR-α) and SREBP-1c, a downstream target of LXR-α that transcriptionally regulates ACC-1 and FAS gene expression (Fig. 5). It was recently demonstrated that E2 can directly regulate adipose tissue LXR-α expression through an ERE in the LXR-α promoter (45Lundholm L. Moverare S. Steffensen K.R. Nilsson M. Otsuki M. Ohlsson C. Gustafsson J.A. Dahlman-Wright K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 879-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast to the down-regulation of genes promoting lipid storage, E2 had no effect on markers of adipocyte differentiation (PPAR-γ, preadipocyte factor 1, and CCCAT/enhancer binding protein-α), or on genes regulating thermogenesis (uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1)), fat oxidation (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX)), or oxidative metabolism-related transcription factors (PPAR-α, PPAR-γ coactivator protein 1α, and estrogen-related receptor α) (data not shown). Collectively, data for adipocytes suggest that estrogen promotes leanness in part by reducing adipocyte size through reduced uptake of fatty acids (down-regulated LPL), reduced lipogenesis (down-regulated ACC-1 and FAS), and elevated catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis. Novel Non-genomic Actions of Estrogen Directly Activate (Phosphorylate) AMPK in Muscle—AMPK is a critical energy sensor in metabolic tissues. Activation of this kinase increases glucose uptake and facilitates fat oxidation by promoting FFA uptake into mitochondria. Activation of AMPK is believed to be an important mediator of the beneficial metabolic effects of exercise (46Pold R. Jensen L.S. Jessen N. Buhl E.S. Schmitz O. Flyvbjerg A. Fujii N. Goodyear L.J.

To assess the potential role of AMPK activation in mediating the metabolic effects of estrogen, we assessed AMPK phosphorylation (threonine 172), a hallmark of AMPK activation in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue of OVX-C and OVX-E2 mice. Western blot analysis revealed a dramatic increase (∼5-fold) in AMPK phosphorylation in the skeletal muscle of OVX-E2 mice (Fig. 6). No differences were seen in liver and adipose tissue AMPK phosphorylation (data not shown). These results suggest that chronic estrogen treatment selectively up-regulates AMPK activity in skeletal muscle of ovariectomized mice. The adipokines leptin and adiponectin have been shown to activate AMPK, whereas resistin is proposed to decrease AMPK activation (47Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Minokoshi Y. Ito Y. Waki H. Uchida S.

We report the discovery of two bright x-ray flares in GRB afterglows, including a giant flare comparable in total energy to the burst itself, each peaking minutes after the burst. These strong, rapid x-ray flares imply that the central engines of the bursts have long periods of activity, with strong internal shocks continuing for hundreds of seconds after the gamma-ray emission has ended."

https://openalex.org/W1965572772,"Growth of normal cells is anchorage dependent because signalling through multiple pathways including Erk, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) and Rac requires integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Components of these pathways localize to low-density, cholesterol-rich domains in the plasma membrane named 'lipid rafts' or 'cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains' (CEMM). We previously reported that integrin-mediated adhesion regulates CEMM transport such that cell detachment from the extracellular matrix triggers CEMM internalization and clearance from the plasma membrane. We now report that this internalization is mediated by dynamin-2 and caveolin-1. Internalization requires phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on Tyr 14. A shift in localization of phospho-caveolin-1 from focal adhesions to caveolae induces CEMM internalization upon cell detachment, which mediates inhibition of Erk, PI(3)K and Rac. These data define a novel molecular mechanism for growth and tumour suppression by caveolin-1."
https://openalex.org/W2060115989,"Neuronal development requires highly coordinated regulation of the cytoskeleton within the developing axon. This dynamic regulation manifests itself in axonal branching, turning and pathfinding, presynaptic differentiation, and growth cone collapse and extension. Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), a secreted guidance cue that primarily functions to repel axons from inappropriate targets, induces cytoskeletal rearrangements that result in growth cone collapse1. These effects require intra-axonal messenger RNA translation. Here we show that transcripts for RhoA, a small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) that regulates the actin cytoskeleton, are localized to developing axons and growth cones, and this localization is mediated by an axonal targeting element located in the RhoA 3′ untranslated region (UTR). Sema3A induces intra-axonal translation of RhoA mRNA, and this local translation of RhoA is necessary and sufficient for Sema3A-mediated growth cone collapse. These studies indicate that local RhoA translation regulates the neuronal cytoskeleton and identify a new mechanism for the regulation of RhoA signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2085786821,"TERT, the protein component of telomerase, serves to maintain telomere function through the de novo addition of telomere repeats to chromosome ends, and is reactivated in 90% of human cancers. In normal tissues, TERT is expressed in stem cells and in progenitor cells, but its role in these compartments is not fully understood. Here we show that conditional transgenic induction of TERT in mouse skin epithelium causes a rapid transition from telogen (the resting phase of the hair follicle cycle) to anagen (the active phase), thereby facilitating robust hair growth. TERT overexpression promotes this developmental transition by causing proliferation of quiescent, multipotent stem cells in the hair follicle bulge region. This new function for TERT does not require the telomerase RNA component, which encodes the template for telomere addition, and therefore operates through a mechanism independent of its activity in synthesizing telomere repeats. These data indicate that, in addition to its established role in extending telomeres, TERT can promote proliferation of resting stem cells through a non-canonical pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1963708619,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an ideal model for the study of many aspects of cell biology, including the hot topic of RNA interference (RNAi). But there was a problem in using the worm to study antiviral RNAi responses: C. elegans seemed not to support viral replication. But now the insect pathogen Flock house virus and the mammalian pathogen vesicular stomatitis virus are both shown to infect the worm, and to provoke a strong RNAi-based antiviral defence. So this important genetic model is now available for the study of host–virus interactions, and the antiviral effect of RNAi. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a model system for studying many aspects of biology, including host responses to bacterial pathogens1,2, but it is not known to support replication of any virus. Plants and insects encode multiple Dicer enzymes that recognize distinct precursors of small RNAs and may act cooperatively3,4,5,6,7. However, it is not known whether the single Dicer of worms and mammals is able to initiate the small RNA-guided RNA interference (RNAi) antiviral immunity as occurs in plants8 and insects9. Here we show complete replication of the Flock house virus (FHV) bipartite, plus-strand RNA genome in C. elegans. We show that FHV replication in C. elegans triggers potent antiviral silencing that requires RDE-1, an Argonaute protein10,11 essential for RNAi mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) but not by microRNAs. This immunity system is capable of rapid virus clearance in the absence of FHV B2 protein, which acts as a broad-spectrum RNAi inhibitor9,12 upstream of rde-1 by targeting the siRNA precursor. This work establishes a C. elegans model for genetic studies of animal virus–host interactions and indicates that mammals might use a siRNA pathway as an antiviral response."

The Sertoli cell, the only somatic cell within seminiferous tubules, provides the stem cell niche through physical support and expression of surface proteins and soluble factors2,3. Here we show that the Ets related molecule4 (ERM) is expressed exclusively within Sertoli cells in the testis and is required for spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal. Mice with targeted disruption of ERM have a loss of maintenance of spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal without a block in normal spermatogenic differentiation and thus have progressive germ-cell depletion and a Sertoli-cell-only syndrome. Microarray analysis of primary Sertoli cells from ERM-deficient mice showed alterations in secreted factors known to regulate the haematopoietic stem cell niche. These results identify a new function for the Ets family transcription factors in spermatogenesis and provide an example of transcriptional control of a vertebrate stem cell niche."

Although posttranslational modification of clock proteins is likely to finely control their circadian functions, only limited information is available to date. Here, we show that BMAL1, an essential transcription factor component of the clock mechanism, is SUMOylated on a highly conserved lysine residue (Lys259) in vivo. BMAL1 shows a circadian pattern of SUMOylation that parallels its activation in the mouse liver. SUMOylation of BMAL1 requires and is induced by CLOCK, the heterodimerization partner of BMAL1. Ectopic expression of a SUMO-deficient BMAL1 demonstrates that SUMOylation plays an important role in BMAL1 circadian expression and clock rhythmicity. This reveals an additional level of regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock."

Pronounced apoptosis was also observed in blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. These events were accompanied by ERK1/2 inactivation and caspase-independent down-regulation of Mcl-1.

Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide or proteasome function with MG132 and pulse-chase studies with [35S]methionine demonstrated that BAY 43-9006 did not diminish Mcl-1 protein stability, nor did it enhance Mcl-1 ubiquitination, but instead markedly attenuated Mcl-1 translation in association with the rapid and potent dephosphorylation of the eIF4E translation initiation factor.

Interestingly, BAY 43-9006 has been shown to inhibit C-Raf and wild type as well as mutant V600E B-Raf kinase activities in vitro and to diminish MEK/ERK activation in various tumor cell lines, including those harboring mutant Ras or B-Raf (21Wilhelm S.M.

For example, depletion of Mcl-1 using antisense oligonucleotides rapidly triggers apoptosis in U937 cells (24Moulding D.A. Giles R.V. Spiller D.G. White M.R. Tidd D.M. Edwards S.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 1756-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, inducible deletion of Mcl-1 in mice resulted in loss of early bone marrow progenitor populations, including hematopoietic stem cells (25Opferman J.T. Iwasaki H. Ong C.C. Suh H. Mizuno S. Akashi K. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2005; 307: 1101-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Deletion of Mcl-1 during early lymphocyte differentiation also increased apoptosis and arrested development at the pro-B-cell and double-negative T-cell stages. In addition, specific ablation of Mcl-1 in peripheral B- and T-cell populations resulted also in their rapid loss (26Opferman J.T. Letai A. Beard C. Sorcinelli M.D. Ong C.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). On the other hand, selective overexpression of Mcl-1 in hematopoietic tissues of transgenic mice promotes the survival of hematopoietic cells and enhances the outgrowth of myeloid cell lines (27Zhou P. Qian L. Bieszczad C.K. Noelle R. Binder M. Levy N.B. Craig R.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 3226-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of Mcl-1 protects cells from apoptosis induced by a variety of agents, including UV, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, etoposide, staurosporine, actinomycin D, among others (28Nijhawan D. Fang M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 29Weng C. Li Y. Xu D. Shi Y. Tang H. J. Biol.

Such evidence suggests that Mcl-1 may play a critical role in the survival of leukemia and possibly other malignant hematopoietic cells. Interestingly, expression of Mcl-1 has been shown to be dependent upon an intact MEK/ERK pathway in both hematopoietic (32Huang H.M. Huang C.J. Yen J.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 1764-1771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and nonhematopoietic cells (33Leu C.M. Chang C. Hu C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1665-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Currently, the one or more mechanisms by which BAY 43-9006 induces cell death in human leukemia cells remain to be fully elucidated. Here we report that BAY 43-9006 potently induces mitochondrial injury and apoptosis in these cells in association with a pronounced and MEK/ERK-independent reduction in Mcl-1 expression. Moreover, prevention of BAY 43-9006-mediated Mcl-1 down-regulation by ectopic expression of an Mcl-1 construct substantially diminishes BAY 43-9006-induced mitochondrial injury and apoptosis. Finally, the present results indicate that BAY 43-9006 down-regulates Mcl-1 expression through inhibition of translation, rather than through a transcriptional, post-translational, or caspase-dependent mechanism.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells—The human leukemia U937, Jurkat, and K562 cells were cultured as previously reported (34Rahmani M. Yu C. Reese E. Ahmed W. Hirsch K. Dent P. Grant S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6231-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). U937 cells stably overexpressing Mcl-1 were kindly provided by Dr. Ruth Craig (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover). These cells were obtained by transfecting U937 cells with a pCEP4-Mcl-1construct that encodes for the 40-kDa Mcl-1 protein. Stable single cell clones were selected in the presence of 400 μg/ml hygromycin. Thereafter, cells from each clone were analyzed for Mcl-1 expression by Western blot. A Tet-On Jurkat cell line inducibly expressing constitutively active MEK1 under doxycycline control was previously described (34Rahmani M. Yu C. Reese E. Ahmed W. Hirsch K. Dent P. Grant S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6231-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Isolation of Patient-derived Leukemic Blasts—Leukemic blasts were obtained with informed consent from the peripheral blood of several patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), FAB subtype M2. These studies have been sanctioned by the Investigational Review Board of Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College of Virginia, and all patients provided informed consent. In each case, the percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood was >70%. Blood was collected into heparinized syringes, diluted 1:3 with RMPI 1640 medium, and transferred as an overlayer to centrifuge tubes containing 10 ml of Ficoll-Hypaque (specific gravity, 1.077–1.081). After centrifugation at room temperature for 30 min, the interface layer, containing predominantly leukemic blasts, was extracted with a sterile Pasteur pipette, suspended in RPMI medium, and washed three times. Leukemic blasts, which displayed >90% viability by trypan blue exclusion, were then diluted into RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at a concentration of 106 cells/ml, and exposed to drugs as described in the case of continuously cultured cell lines.Reagents—BAY 43-9006 (Bayer, West Haven, CT) was provided by Dr. John Wright, Cancer Treatment and Evaluation Program, NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). It was dissolved in Me2SO, and aliquots were maintained at –80 °C. MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem; cycloheximide and actinomycin D were purchased from Sigma. SB202190 was purchased from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). Rapamycin and U0126 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The broad spectrum cell-permeable caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-FMK was purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). All reagents were prepared and used as recommended by their suppliers.Assessment of Apoptosis—Apoptotic cells were routinely identified by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining as previously described (35Rahmani M. Dai Y. Grant S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 277: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, 105 cells were collected, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) containing fluorescein-labeled annexin V (BD Pharmingen) and propidium iodide. Samples were incubated for 15 min and then analyzed by flow cytometer (BD Biosciences FACScan).Quantitative Real-time PCR—U937 cells were left untreated or treated with 10 μm BAY 43-9006 for the indicated period after which they were lysed and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was carried out on the ABI Prism® 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the TaqMan® One Step PCR Master Mix Reagents Kit (polynucleotide: 4309169) as recommended by the manufacturer. The cycling conditions were: 48 °C/30 min; 95 °C/10 min; and 40 cycles of 95 °C/15 s and 60 °C/1 min. The cycle threshold was determined to provide the optimal standard curve values (0.98–1.0). The probes (5′-TCAAGTGTTTAGCCACAAAGGCACCAAAAG-3′) and Mcl-1-specific primers (forward, GGGCAGGATTGTGACTCTCATT; reverse, 5′-GATGCAGCTTTCTTGGTTTATGG-3′) were designed using the Primer Express® 2.0 version. The probes were labeled at the 5′-end with 6-carboxyfluoresceine and at the 3′-end with 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. Ribosomal RNA (18 S rRNA) was used as endogenous control. Each sample was tested in triplicate, and the Mcl-1 mRNA level was normalized to that of 18 S rRNA.Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—K562 cells were transiently transfected using Amaxa nucleofector™ (Koeln, Germany) as previously described (36Dai Y. Rahmani M. Corey S.J. Dent P. Grant S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34227-34239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Constitutively active MNK1 T332D and eIF4E (wild type) were kindly provided by Dr. J. A. Cooper (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) (37Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). PcDNA3.1-Mcl-1 was a generous gift from Dr. R. W. Craig. Empty vector pcDNA3.1 was purchased from Invitrogen. Reporter gene assays were carried out as previously described (38Rahmani M. Reese E. Dai Y. Bauer C. Kramer L.B. Huang M. Jove R. Dent P. Grant S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1166-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cotransfected with a –203/+10-Mcl-1-pGL2 plasmid (39Croxton R. Ma Y. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1563-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) in which firefly luciferase is driven by the –203 to +10 element of the Mcl-1 gene promoter, or the pGL2-basic empty vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and pRL-TK-luc plasmid encoding for Renilla luciferase. Cells were incubated for 6 h and then treated with BAY 43-9006 for an additional 20 h, after which the activity of firefly and Renilla luciferases was measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Values for firefly luciferase activity were normalized to those obtained for Renilla luciferase activity.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, antiproteases (10 μg/ml of leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 1% Triton X-100 after which 500 μg of protein lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation using the designated antibodies. Immunoblotting was performed using the immunoprecipitates or the whole cells lysates as previously described in detail (35Rahmani M. Dai Y. Grant S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 277: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: caspase-3, Bax, caspase-7, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 (BD Pharmingen); Caspase-8 (Alexis Corp.); poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP, Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA); Bcl-xL XIAP, total and Phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), ubiquitin, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, phospho-4EBP1 (Ser-65), phospho-eIF4E (Ser-209), phospho-eIF4G (Ser-1108), phospho-p90RSK (Ser-380), phospho-p70S6K (Thr-389), phospho-p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182), and phospho-JNK1 (Thr-183/Tyr-185) (Cell Signaling Technology); eIF4G (BD Transduction Laboratories); Bim, HA, cytochrome c, AIF, total and phosphorylated Bcr-abl, eIF4E, p70S6K, myc, JNK1, and p38 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); and Bak and α-tubulin (Calbiochem).Mcl-1 Protein Stability—U937 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and cultured at a density of 5 × 106 cells, in methionine-free RPMI for 15 min, then labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (ICN, Biomedicals, Inc., Irvine, CA) for 60 min. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in complete RPMI containing fetal bovine serum and excess of cold methionine (10 mm) and cysteine (5 mm) for the indicated periods in the presence or absence of BAY 43-9006 with or without the proteasome inhibitor MG132. At the end of the indicated intervals, 107 cells were collected and subsequently subjected to immunoprecipitation using Mcl-1 antibodies as described above. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.m7-GTP-Sepharose Chromatography—Following stimulation, cells were lysed in lysis buffer as indicated above. 500 μg of protein lysates was incubated with 50 μl of m7-GTP-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4°C after which the beads were washed three times and boiled in Laemmli buffer for 5 min, and following centrifugation, the supernatants containing the proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis.Subcellular Fractionation—Leukemic cells (4 × 106) were lysed using digitonin buffer (35Rahmani M. Dai Y. Grant S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 277: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), after which cytosolic and membrane fractions were separated by centrifugation, solubilized in Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were analyzed by Western blot to evaluate cytochrome c release into the cytosol.Statistical Analysis—The significance of differences between experimental conditions was determined using the Student's t test for unpaired observations.RESULTSTreatment with BAY 43-9006 Results in a Marked Induction of Mitochondrial Injury and Apoptosis in Human Leukemia Cells—To characterize the effects of BAY 43-9006 in U937 cells, dose-response and time-course studies were performed (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1A, exposure of U937 cells to increasing concentrations of BAY 43-9006 for 24 h revealed a moderate induction of apoptosis at concentration as low as 5 μm as indicated by annexin V analysis. Higher concentration of BAY 43-9006 resulted in more pronounced cell death (e.g. 80% at 15 μm). Virtually identical results were obtained in Jurkat lymphoid leukemia cells (Fig. 1B). Exposure of U937 cells to 10 μm BAY 43-9006 at varying intervals resulted in induction of apoptosis that was detected as early as 4 h after drug treatment. Longer exposure intervals resulted in a marked increase in cell death (e.g. 55 and 70% at 24 and 48 h, respectively). Essentially equivalent findings were observed when Jurkat cells were examined (data not shown). Furthermore, exposure to BAY 43-9006 resulted in a release of cytochrome c and AIF into the cytosol (Fig. 1D) accompanied by cleavage of caspases-7, -8, -9, and -3 as well as PARP (Fig. 1E). These events were readily apparent after 8 h of treatment and became more pronounced after 20 h. Together, these findings indicate that BAY 43-9006 results in a striking induction of caspase activation, mitochondrial injury, and apoptosis in human myeloid and lymphoid leukemic cells.Exposure of U937 Cells to BAY 43-9006 Is Associated with a Decrease in ERK Phosphorylation—Dose-response studies (Fig. 2) revealed that exposure of U937 cells to BAY 43-9006 at concentration as low as 5 μm resulted in a discernable decrease in ERK phosphorylation as early as half an hour after beginning of exposure, and this decrease persisted at 4 and 8 h of drug administration. Exposure to 7.5 and 10 μm BAY 43-9006 produced even more pronounced reductions in ERK phosphorylation. In contrast, total levels of ERK were unchanged. These findings confirm that, as previously described in other cell types (21Wilhelm S.M. Carter C. Tang L. Wilkie D. McNabola A. Rong H. Chen C. Zhang X. Vincent P. McHugh M. Cao Y. Shujath J.

U937 cells were exposed to BAY 43-9006 for 0.5, 4, and 8 h, after which protein lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis to monitor ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Each lane was loaded with 20 μg of protein; the blots were subsequently reprobed with antibody directed against tubulin to control for equal loading and transfer of proteins. Two additional experiments yielded similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Treatment of U937 Cells with BAY 43-9006 Results in Rapid Decrease in Mcl-1 Protein Level and Late Bcl-2, Bax, and XIAP Cleavage—In view of the critical role that Bcl-2 family proteins play in apoptosis regulation (40Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar, 41Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J.

After 20 h of treatment, a decline in protein levels of Bcl-xL, Bak, Bim, as well as cleavage of Bcl-2, Bax, and XIAP were detected, however, no major changes were observed at earlier intervals. The finding that these changes were detected after caspase activation argues against the possibility of a primary role for these phenomena in BAY 43-9006-mediated cell death.

https://openalex.org/W2019213459,"Osteoclast differentiation from hematopoietic precursors is controlled by the tumor necrosis factor family member tumor necrosis factor-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE) via induction of various transcription factors, including nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) c1. During osteoclast differentiation, NFATc1 is further activated via calcium signaling when costimulatory receptors expressed on osteoclast precursors, such as osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR), are stimulated. Here we show that NFATc1 expression precedes that of OSCAR during TRANCE-mediated osteoclastogenesis and that inhibition of NFATc1 by cyclosporin A abolishes TRANCE-induced OSCAR expression and subsequent osteoclast differentiation. Moreover, we show that the 1.0-kb promoter region of the OSCAR gene contains three potential NFATc1-binding sites. Induction of an OSCAR promoter-luciferase reporter is significantly increased when transiently transfected into 293T cells in combination with NFATc1 expression plasmid. Deletion and site-directed mutant constructs confirmed that NFATc1-binding sites are both functional and NFATc1-specific. Furthermore, NFATc1 synergistically activates an OSCAR reporter construct together with microphthalmia transcription factor and PU.1, transcription factors previously shown to be critical for osteoclast differentiation. In addition, a plasmid expressing constitutively active MAP kinase kinase 6 enhances the transactivation activity of NFATc1/microphthalmia transcription factor/PU.1 on the OSCAR promoter. Taken together, our results indicate that NFATc1 is an important transcription factor in the induction of OSCAR during osteoclastogenesis. Elucidation of NFATc1 as a transcription factor for OSCAR expression implies the presence of a positive feedback circuit of TRANCE-induced activation of NFATc1, involving NFATc1-mediated OSCAR expression and its subsequent activation of NFATc1, necessary for efficient differentiation of osteoclasts.

Recently, it has been reported that ectopic expression of NFATc1 causes precursors to undergo efficient differentiation in the absence of TRANCE and that NFATc1-deficient embryonic stem cells fail to differentiate into osteoclasts in response to TRANCE (14Takayanagi H.

OSCAR is a member of the Ig-like surface receptor family and plays an important role as a costimulatory receptor for osteoclast differentiation (16Kim N. Takami M. Rho J. Josien R. Choi Y. J. Exp.

Although NFATc1 plays a central role in regulating terminal differentiation of osteoclasts mediated by TRANCE and in inducing the expression of osteoclast-specific genes such as TRAP and calcitonin receptor, a role for NFATc1 in the regulation of OSCAR gene expression has not yet been described. We report here that NFATc1 directly induces OSCAR gene expression. In addition, OSCAR expression is synergistically regulated by the combined activity of Mitf, PU.1, and NFATc1. Therefore, this study indicates that NFATc1, cooperating with other transcription factors, plays a role in the up-regulation of its target genes that include the costimulatory receptor OSCAR. Of significance, our data suggest a potentially important molecular mechanism of osteoclast differentiation via a positive feedback circuit involving TRANCE, NFATc1, and OSCAR. Reagents—All of the cell culture media and supplements were obtained from Invitrogen. Soluble recombinant mouse TRANCE was purified from insect cells as described (24Kim N. Odgren P.R. Kim D.K. Marks Jr., S.C. Choi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10905-10910Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and recombinant human M-CSF was a gift from Dr. Daved Fremont (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). TRIzol was obtained from Invitrogen. The Ready-to-Go labeling kit and ProbeQuant G-50 purification kit were from Amersham Biosciences. Cyclosporin A and SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem. Expression Vectors and OSCAR Promoter Luciferase Constructs—The Mitf expression vector (pFLAG CMV-Mitf), the PU.1 expression vector (pFLAG CMV-PU.1), and the 1.0-kb OSCAR reporter plasmid (pGL2 OSCAR 1.0) were constructed as previously described (9So H.

NFATc1 expression vector (pcDNA3-NFATc1) and retroviral vector containing constitutively active NFATc1 (MSCV-ca-NFATc1) were kindly provided by Dr. M. A. Brown (Emory University School of Medicine) and Dr. N. A. Clipstone (Northwestern University), respectively (15Hirotani H. Tuohy N.A. Woo J.T. Stern P.H. Clipstone N.A. J. Biol.

Ostrowski M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11077-11083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of the NFATc1-binding sites, pGL2 OSCAR 0.2 (–200 to +68), and pGL2 OSCAR 0.05 (–50 to +68), were generated by PCR and cloned into pGL2 basic vector. Point mutations of N1 and N2 in the OSCAR promoter were generated by the QuikChange method of site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis were: N1 point mutant type (Mut), 5′-GTT TTT TGT TGT TGT TGT TGT TGT TGG CCT CTT GGC CAT TTT TCT TCC TCC CAC CTG CCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGG CAG GTG GGA GGA AGA AAA ATG GCC AAG AGG CCA ACA ACA ACA ACA ACA ACA AAA AAC-3′ (antisense); N2 point Mut, 5′-GAC TGT TCC ATC TTG CAA CTT TGG CCA AGA CAA TGA AAC TAT GAC ACA GTT ACC C-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGG TAA CTG TGT CAT AGT TTC ATT GTC TTG GCCAAA GTT GCA AGA TGG AAC AGTC-3′(antisense). All of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Korea Basic Science Institute, Gwangju, Korea). Osteoclast Formation—Murine osteoclasts were prepared from bone marrow cells as previously described (9So H. Rho J. Jeong D. Park R. Fisher D.E. Ostrowski M.C. Choi Y. Kim N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24209-24216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Takami M. Kim N. Rho J. Choi Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1516-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In brief, bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing femurs and tibiae from 6–8-week-old ICR mice. Bone marrow cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with M-CSF (5 ng/ml) for 16 h in 100-mm-diameter dishes (Corning Glass, Corning, NY) to separate adherent cells and nonadherent cells. Then nonadherent cells were harvested and cultured with M-CSF (30 ng/ml) in 100-mm-diameter dishes (1 × 107 cells/10 ml/dish). After 3 days of culture, floating cells were removed, and attached cells were used as osteoclast precursors (BMMs). BMMs were treated with cell dissociation solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min and harvested. To generate osteoclasts, BMMs were cultured with M-CSF (30 ng/ml) and TRANCE (100 ng/ml) for 3 days. In some experiments, cyclosporin A or SB203589 (10 μm) was added to the cultures as indicated in figures. All of the cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Ectopic Overexpression of NFATc1 in BMMs—Plat-E cells were transfected with MSCV-ca-NFATc1 or control vector plasmid. Viral supernatant was collected from cultured media 24–48 h after transfection. BMMs were incubated with virus supernatant for 8 h in the presence of polybrene (10 μg/ml). After removing the viral supernatant, BMMs were further cultured for 4 days in the presence of M-CSF (30 ng/ml). RT-PCR—RT-PCR analysis was performed using cDNA from BMMs overexpressing ca-NFATc1 or control. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was transcribed from 1 μg of RNA using Superscript RT (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the supplier. The PCR was performed at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for a total of 25 cycles (for NFATc1, TRAP, and HPRT) or 30 cycles (for OSCAR and calcitonin receptor). The primers used were the following: 5′-NFATc1, 5′-CTC GAA AGA CAG CAC TGG AGC AT-3′; 3′-NFATc1, 5′-CGG CTG CCT TCC GTC TCA TAG-3′; 5′-OSCAR, 5′-CTG CTG GTA ACG GAT CAG CTC CCC AGA-3′; 3′-OSCAR, 5′-CCA AGG AGC CAG AAC CTT CGA AAC T-3′; 5′-TRAP, 5′-CAG TTG GCA GCA GCC AAG GAG GAC-3′; 3′-TRAP, 5′-GTC CCT CAG GAG TCT AGG TAT CAC-3′; 5′-calcitonin receptor, 5′-GTT CTT CAG GCT CCT ACC AAT CTC A-3′; 3′-calcitonin receptor, 5′-TCA CCC TCT GGC AGC TAA GGT TCT-3′; 5′-HPRT, 5′-GTA ATG ATC AGT CAA CGG GGG AC-3′; and 3′-HPRT, 5′-CCA GCA AGC TTG CAA CCT TAA CCA-3′. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA samples were electrophoresed and transferred to nylon membranes as described (16Kim N. Takami M. Rho J. Josien R. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed at 42 °C for 16 h with a [32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probe prepared using the Ready-to-Go labeling kit and ProbeQuant G-50 purification kit. After washing with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 56 °C for 1 h, the membrane was exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak, New Haven, CT). Western Blot Analysis—Cells from transfected 293T, BMMs, or osteoclasts were harvested after washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% protease inhibitor mixture). The cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Primary antibodies used included NFATc1 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), OSCAR (16Kim N. Takami M. Rho J. Josien R. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were probed and developed with ECL solution (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were detected and analyzed by LAS3000 luminescent image analyzer (Fuji Co., Tokyo, Japan). Transfection and Luciferase Assay—For transfection of reporter plasmids, 293T cells were plated on 24-well plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well on 1 day before transfection. A total of 500 ng of plasmid DNA was mixed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Sciences) and transfected into the cells following the manufacturer's protocol. The amount of transfected DNA was held constant to 500 ng by the addition of empty vector DNA where necessary. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and then lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was measured with a luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured in triplicate, averaged, and then normalized with β-galactosidase activity using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich) as a substrate. In Vitro Translation and Preparation of Probes—Full-length murine NFATc1 cDNA was transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase, and RNA was subjected to in vitro translation with TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing the NFATc1-binding site 1 (N1) or the NFATc1-binding site 2 (N2) were labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—4 μl of TnT cell lysate and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. After pre-incubation, 50,000 cpm labeled probes and reaction buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, and 5% glycerol) were added and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Samples were resolved on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE buffer. N1 and N2 oligonucleotides encompassing nucleotides –266 to –236 and –92 to –69 of mouse OSCAR promoter, respectively, were used as probes and cold competitors. Wild and mutant type sequences of NFATc1-binding sites are as follows: N1 wild type, 5′-TGT TGT TGT TTT CCT CTT TTC CAT TTT TCT T-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAG AAA AAT GGA AAA GAG GAA AAC AAC AAC A-3′ (antisense); N1 Mut, 5′-TGT TGT TGT TAA GCT CTT AAG CAT TTT TCT T-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAG AAA AAT GCT TAA GAG CTT AAC AAC AAC A-3′ (antisense); N2 wild type, 5′-CTT GCA ACT TTT TCC AAG ACA ATG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAT TGT CTT GGA AAA AGT TGC AAG-3′ (antisense), N2 Mut, 5′-CTT GCA ACT TTA AGC AAG ACA ATG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAT TGT CTT GCT TAA AGT TGC AAG-3′ (antisense). Antibodies against NFATc1 (BD Pharmingen) or Mitf (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for supershift experiments. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—A ChIP assay was performed with a ChIP kit (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 × 106 BMMs or osteoclasts were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed, harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 0.01% protease inhibitor mixture). The cells were sonicated to shear the DNA and then subjected to centrifugation. Supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-NFATc1 or with control murine IgG antibody at 4 °C overnight. Cross-linking between protein and DNA were reversed by incubation at 65 °C for 4 h, and protein was digested with proteinase K. After extraction with phenol/chloroform, DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in distilled water. PCR was performed using specific primers for 35 cycles. PCR products were subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. The following primers were used for PCR: 5′-GAA CAC CAG AGG CTA TGA CTG TTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCG TGG AGC TGA GGA AAA GGT TG-3′ (antisense). Gene Expression of NFATc1 and OSCAR during Osteoclastogenesis Mediated by TRANCE—NFATc1 is a key regulator in the late phase of TRANCE-induced osteoclastogenesis and acts upon osteoclast-specific genes such as TRAP and calcitonin receptor (13Matsumoto M.

To investigate the gene expression pattern of NFATc1 and its putative target genes, we performed Northern blot analysis using BMMs treated with M-CSF and TRANCE (Fig. 1A). TRANCE stimulation increased the expression of NFATc1 mRNA. The induction of NFATc1 gene expression was followed by the expression of TRAP and calcitonin receptor. In addition, OSCAR, an important modulator of osteoclast differentiation, was found to be expressed at later time point than NFATc1, suggesting that NFATc1 might induce the gene expression of OSCAR, as well as that of its other known targets. It has been shown that cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of calcineurin activity, inhibits TRANCE-mediated osteoclastogenesis by suppressing NFATc1 gene expression (14Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T.

To investigate whether down-regulation of NFATc1 expression by cyclosporin A would affect the expression level of OSCAR, we performed Western blot analysis on samples prepared in the absence or presence of cyclosporin A. Consistent with the mRNA expression profile, the expression of NFATc1 was followed by that of OSCAR gene during osteoclastogenesis. Compared with the control, cyclosporin A inhibited the expression of NFATc1 as well as of OSCAR, which would normally be induced by TRANCE stimulation (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the same concentration (10 μg/ml) of cyclosporin A completely inhibited osteoclast formation mediated by M-CSF and TRANCE (Fig. 1, C and D). These results suggest that NFATc1 may regulate the expression of OSCAR. Identification of Consensus Binding Sites for NFATc1 on OSCAR Promoter—We previously showed that there are two E-boxes for Mitf and two functional PU.1-binding sites in the murine OSCAR promoter region (9So H. Rho J. Jeong D. Park R. Fisher D.E. Ostrowski M.C. Choi Y. Kim N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24209-24216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition to these regulatory cis-elements, we also found three potential NFATc1-binding sites that closely matched the consensus sequence (5′-GGAAAA-3′). These three sites were located from –245 to –258 (N1, 5′-GGAAAAGAGGAAAA-3′) and from –78 to –83 (N2, 5′-GGAAAA-3′) in the region of OSCAR promoter upstream of the transcription start site (Fig. 2). OSCAR Is a Target of the Transcription Factor NFATc1—To examine whether NFATc1 can directly regulate OSCAR expression in osteoclasts, we used a reporter assay involving transient transfections into 293 human embryonic kidney cells (293T), which show high transfection efficiency. The 1.0-kb OSCAR promoter region, including the transcription initiation site, was constructed in the pGL2 basic luciferase vector. This pGL2 OSCAR 1.0 plasmid was cotransfected with various amounts of NFATc1 plasmid. As shown in Fig. 3A, NFATc1 increased the luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Because NFATc1 expression increased OSCAR promoter activity, we further examined which of the two NFATc1-binding sites (N1 and N2) was critical for NFATc1 binding. To address this question, various deletion plasmids were constructed and transfected into 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, luciferase activities were slightly decreased in the pGL2 OSCA"

BMPs were originally identified as molecules that induced ectopic bone formation when implanted into rodent muscles (1Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar, 2Urist M.R. Science. 1965; 150: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (4504) Google Scholar). In accordance with such in vivo effects, BMPs have been shown to regulate osteogenic differentiation in vitro (3Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ernesto Canalis M.D. Skeletal Growth Factors. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2000: 269-290Google Scholar). However, naturally occurring or genetically engineered mice deficient in BMPs reported so far are either normal, exhibit abnormalities in skeletal patterning, or die during early embryonic development, thus being non-informative as to the role of endogenous BMPs in bone formation (4Zhao G.Q. Genesis. 2003; 35: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 5Karsenty G. Ernesto Canalis M.D. Skeletal Growth Factors.

In mammals, there are two distinct modes of bone formation: intramembranous and endochondral (6Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). Most of the bones form through the latter process, which is characterized by the replacement of a cartilage mold by bone and bone marrow (7Chung U.I. Endocr. J. 2004; 51: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). During this process, cells in the mesenchymal condensations become chondrocytes, the primary cell type of cartilage; cells at the border of the condensations form a perichondrium. Chondrocytes have a characteristic shape, express a characteristic genetic program driven by SOX9 and other transcription factors, and secrete a matrix rich in type II collagen and proteoglycan. Cartilage enlarges through chondrocyte proliferation and matrix production. Chondrocytes in the center of the cartilage mold then stop proliferating, enlarge (hypertrophy), and change their genetic program to synthesize the type X collagen. Hypertrophic chondrocytes mineralize their surrounding matrix, attract blood vessels through the production of the vascular endothelial growth factor and other factors, and attract chondroclasts and osteoclasts. Moreover, these chondrocytes direct mesenchymal cells in the perichondrium and in the bone marrow to become osteoblasts, which form the bone collar and the primary spongiosa (8Chung U.I. Schipani E. McMahon A.P. Kronenberg H.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 9Takeda S. Bonnamy J.P. Owen M.J. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Thus, during the endochondral bone formation, hypertrophic chondrocytes link chondrogenesis to osteogenesis by inducing osteogenesis and angiogenesis (8Chung U.I. Schipani E. McMahon A.P. Kronenberg H.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 9Takeda S. Bonnamy J.P. Owen M.J. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Hypertrophic chondrocytes express a number of growth factors, cytokines, and matrix proteins. Among them, Indian hedgehog (Ihh) has been proven to be indispensable for the induction of osteogenesis by these chondrocytes (8Chung U.I. Schipani E. McMahon A.P. Kronenberg H.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 10Long F. Chung U.I. Ohba S. McMahon J. Kronenberg H.M. McMahon A.P. Development. 2004; 131: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Ihh alone, however, cannot induce bone formation (11Long F. Zhang X.M. Karp S. Yang Y. McMahon A.P. Development. 2001; 128: 5099-5108PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that other factors secreted from these chondrocytes may also be necessary for osteogenesis. Because some BMPs can induce ectopic bone formation when implanted into rodent muscles and promote osteogenic differentiation in vitro, they are strong candidates for the osteogenic factors secreted by these chondrocytes. Among them, BMP2 and BMP6 are known to be expressed by these chondrocytes (8Chung U.I. Schipani E. McMahon A.P. Kronenberg H.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). As is the case with the other BMPs, however, there is no direct evidence that the endogenous BMP2 and BMP6 are involved in bone formation, because homozygous Bmp2-deficient (Bmp2-/-) mice die during the early embryonic stage (12Zhang H. Bradley A. Development. 1996; 122: 2977-2986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and homozygous Bmp6-deficient (Bmp6-/-) mice show no skeletal abnormality except for a slight delay in the ossification of the sternum (13Solloway M.J. Dudley A.T. Bikoff E.K. Lyons K.M. Hogan B.L. Robertson E.J. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 321-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that there might be a genetic redundancy between BMP2 and BMP6 in the regulation of bone formation. Hence, the present study generated compound knock-out mice lacking one allele of the Bmp2 gene and both alleles of the Bmp6 gene (Bmp2+/-; Bmp6-/-) and investigated the effect of their compound loss on bone metabolism under both physiological and pathological conditions. Animals—Bmp2+/- mice were kindly provided by A. Bradley (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) (12Zhang H. Bradley A. Development. 1996; 122: 2977-2986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); Bmp6-/- mice by E. Robertson (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) (13Solloway M.J. Dudley A.T. Bikoff E.K. Lyons K.M. Hogan B.L. Robertson E.J. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 321-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The mice were maintained in a C57BL/6 background. To generate Bmp2+/-; Bmp6-/- mice, Bmp2+/- mice were mated with the homozygous Bmp6-/- mice to obtain Bmp2+/-;Bmp6+/- mice. Bmp2+/-; Bmp6+/- mice were then mated with each other. Because Bmp2-/- mice were embryonically lethal, two of 12 live mice were expected to be Bmp2+/-;Bmp6-/-. All experiments were performed on male mice in accordance with the protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Tokyo. Genotyping—Genomic DNA was isolated from the tail. 10 ng of genonic DNA was used for genotyping by PCR. The PCR primers were as follows: 5′-AGCATGAACCCTCATGTGTTGG-3′ (forward primer for Bmp2 wild-type (WT) and mutant alleles), 5′-GTGACATTAGGCTGCTGTAGCA-3′ (reverse primer for Bmp2 WT allele), 5′-GAGACTAGTGAGACGTGCTACT-3′ (reverse primer for Bmp2 mutant allele), 5′-TCCCCACATCAACGACAC-3′ (forward primer for Bmp6 WT and mutant alleles), 5′-TCCCCACCACACAGTCCTTG-3′ (reverse primer for Bmp6 WT allele) and 5′-CGCTGACAGCCGGAACACGG-3′ (reverse primer Bmp6 mutant allele). PCR were performed at 94 °C for 1 min, at 58 °C for 1 min, and at 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles. The PCR product from the WT Bmp2 allele was 322 bp and that from the Bmp2 mutant allele, 367 bp. The PCR product from the WT Bmp6 allele was 112 bp and that from the Bmp6 mutant allele, 499 bp. Skeletal Preparation—Embryos at E17.5 were eviscerated, fixed in 100% ethanol for 4 days, and then transferred to 100% acetone. After 3 days, they were rinsed with water and stained for 10 days in staining solution containing 1 volume of 0.1% Alizarin red S (Sigma), 95% ethanol; 1 volume of 0.3% Alcian blue 8GX (Sigma), 70% ethanol; 1 volume of 100% acetic acid, and 17 volumes of 100% ethanol. After rinsing with 96% ethanol, the specimens were kept in 20% glycerol, 1% KOH at 37 °C for 16 h and subsequently at room temperature until the skeletons became clearly visible. For storage, the specimens were transferred to 50, 80, and finally 100% glycerol (14Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.H. Inada M. Sato M. Okamoto R. Kitamura Y. Yoshiki S. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1997; 89: 755-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3653) Google Scholar). Histological Analysis—For the histological analysis, embryonic limbs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h and embedded in paraffin for sectioning, according to the standard procedures. Sections (5 μm thick) were then stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) for morphological study, with toluidine blue for detection of the cartilage matrix, or with 5% silver nitrate for detection of mineralization (the von Kossa method), then mounted in xylene-based media, and photographed. For immunohistochemistry, after treatment with 25 μg/ml hyaluronidase for 1 h at 37°C, the sections were incubated with monoclonal rat anti-mouse antibodies against the type I, II, and X collagens (LSL, Tokyo, Japan), and MMP-13 (CHEMICON International, Inc., Temecula, CA) for 12-24 h at 4 °C. To visualize the immunoreactivity for type I, II, and X collagens using fluorescence, the sections were incubated with the Alexa 488 anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. To visualize the immunoreactivity for MMP-13, the sections were incubated with the horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies against rabbit IgG (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH) for 20 min at room temperature, immersed in a diaminobenzidine solution for 10 min at room temperature, then counterstained with methylgreen. As a control, rabbit nonimmune serum (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA) was used at the same dilution instead of the primary antibody. To quantify the areas of interest, NIH Image was used to measure the ratio to the total area. In Situ Hybridization—Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C, processed, embedded in paraffin, and cut. The in situ hybridization was performed as previously described (15Lee K. Deeds J.D. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 453-463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using complementary 35S-labeled riboprobes for mouse BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, BMP7, GDF5 (kindly provided by E. Robertson, Harvard University) (13Solloway M.J. Dudley A.T. Bikoff E.K. Lyons K.M. Hogan B.L. Robertson E.J. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 321-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and type I collagen (8Chung U.I. Schipani E. McMahon A.P. Kronenberg H.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using an ISOGEN Kit (Wako Pure Chemicals Industry, Ltd., Tokyo) and an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), then treated with DNase I (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. One μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using a Takara RNA PCR Kit (AMV) version 2.1 (Takara Shuzo Co., Shiga, Japan) to generate the single-stranded cDNA. PCR was performed with the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each PCR consisted of 1× QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen), 0.3 μm specific primers, and 500 ng of cDNA. The mRNA copy number of a specific gene in the total RNA was calculated with a standard curve generated using serially diluted plasmids containing PCR amplicon sequences and normalized to the human or rodent total RNA (Applied Biosystems) with mouse actin as the internal control. Standard plasmids were synthesized using a TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All reactions were run in triplicate. The primer sequences are available upon request. Radiological Analysis—Bone radiographs were taken with a soft x-ray instrument (CMB-2, SOFTEX, Kanagawa, Japan). A three-dimensional CT scan was taken with a composite x-ray analyzing system (NX-HCP, NS-ELEX Inc., Tokyo). The bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by single energy x-ray absorptiometry using a bone mineral analyzer (DCS-600R, Aloka Co., Tokyo). Bone Histomorphometry—Eight 9-week-old mice were used in each group. For Villanueva-Goldner staining, tibias were fixed with ethanol, embedded in methyl methacrylate, and sectioned in 6-μm slices. For double labeling, the mice were subcutaneously injected with 8 mg/kg body weight of calcein at 3 and 10 days before sacrifice. Tartrate-resistand acid phosphatase-positive cells were stained at pH 5.0 in the presence of l-(+)-tartaric acid with naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma) in N,N-dimethyl formamide as the substrate. The specimens were subjected to histomorphometric analyses using an image analyzer (Histometry RT CAMERA, System Supply Co., Nagano, Japan). The parameters of the trabecular bone were measured in an area 1.2 mm in length from 0.5 mm below the growth plate at the proximal metaphysis of the tibias. The parameters of the cortical bone were measured at the midshaft of the tibias. The thickness of the growth plate was measured at the proximal tibias. Fracture Model—Bone fractures were generated as previously described (16Shimoaka T. Kamekura S. Chikuda H. Hoshi K. Chung U.I. Akune T. Maruyama Z. Komori T. Matsumoto M. Ogawa W. Terauchi Y. Kadowaki T. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15314-15322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Eight 9-week-old mice were used in each group. Briefly, under general anesthesia with xylazine (0.05 mg/10 g body weight) and ketamine (0.5 mg/10 g body weight, Sigma), a 15-mm incision was longitudinally made to expose the femur. A transverse osteotomy was performed with a bone saw (Volvere GX, NSK Nakanishi, Inc., Tochigi, Japan) at the middle of the femur. Fractured bones were repositioned, and then the full-length of the bone marrow cavity was internally stabilized with an intramedullary nail with the inner pin of a 23-gauge spinal needle. The animals were allowed activity, diet, and water ad libitum. For the histological analyses, the animals were killed at 5, 7, and 18 days after surgery by asphyxiation with carbon dioxide, and their femurs were excised. The calcified area and the bone mineral content of the entire femur were measured. The % gain of calcified area and the % gain of BMC were calculated, and the differences were compared between WT, Bmp2+/-, Bmp6-/-, and Bmp2+/-;Bmp6-/- mice. To distinguish between the intramembranous bone formation and endochondral bone formation during fracture healing, the callus was divided into three equal portions along the axis of the bone. The distal and proximal portions, where bones mainly form through the intramembranous process (17Kawaguchi H. Kurokawa T. Hanada K. Hiyama Y. Tamura M. Ogata E. Matsumoto T. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), were designated as the peripheral part, and the middle portion, where bones mainly form through the endochondral process (17Kawaguchi H. Kurokawa T. Hanada K. Hiyama Y. Tamura M. Ogata E. Matsumoto T. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), was designated as the central part. In each part, we measured the ratio of the calcified area to the total area of the histological sections using NIH Image. Serum and Urinary Biochemistry—Blood samples from 9-week-old WT and Bmp2+/-;Bmp6-/- mice (n = 6 for each group) were collected by heart puncture under anesthesia with nembutal (0.4 mg/10 g body weight) (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo). Urine samples were collected for 24 h before sacrifice in oil-sealed bottles in the metabolism cages (CL-0305, CLEA Japan, Inc., Tokyo). The levels of creatinine, calcium, and inorganic phosphorus in the serum were measured using a standard colorimetric technique, a Calcium HR Kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), and an Inorganic Phosphorus II Kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), respectively, by an autoanalyzer (Type 7170, Hitachi High-Technologies Co., Tokyo). Urinary deoxypyridinoline was measured using a Pyriliks-D enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Metra Biosystems, Inc., Mountain View, CA). The values were corrected for urinary creatinine measured by a standard colorimetric technique using the Type 7170 autoanalyzer. In Vitro Bone Marrow Differentiation Assay—Bone marrow cells were isolated from WT and Bmp2+-;Bmp6-/- mice at 3 weeks of age and inoculated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well onto 24-well plates in α-minimal essential medium containing 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and ITS+1 liquid media supplement (×100) (Sigma) (osteogenic medium). For treatment with BMP, we added recombinant human (rh) BMP2 at 200 ng/ml. We changed the medium every 4 days with BMP2 being replenished each time. Two weeks after confluence, total RNA was extracted, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Alizarin red S, and von Kossa stainings were performed. For ALP staining, cells were fixed in 70% EtOH and stained for 10 min with a solution containing 0.01% naphtol AS-MX phosphate disodium salt (Sigma), 1% N,N-dimethyl formamide (Wako Pure Chemicals Industry, Ltd.), and 0.06% fast blue BB (Sigma). For the Alizarin red S staining, the cells were fixed in 10% formalin/phosphate-buffered saline and stained for 10 min with 2% Alizarin red S, pH 4.0, (Sigma) solution. For the von Kossa staining, the cells were fixed with 100% ethanol at room temperature for 15 min, stained with 5% silver nitrate solution (Wako Pure Chemicals Industry, Ltd.) under ultraviolet light for 10 min, and incubated for 5 min with 5% sodium thiosulfate solution (Wako Pure Chemicals Industry, Ltd.). The numbers of total fibroblastic colonies (CFU-F), ALP positive colonies (CFU-ALP), and bone nodules were assessed as described (18Aubin J.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 30-31: 73-82Crossref Google Scholar, 19Malaval L. Aubin J.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 63-70Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Nishida S. Tsurukami H. Sakai A. Sakata T. Ikeda S. Tanaka M. Ito M. Nakamura T. Bone. 2002; 30: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, bone marrow cells isolated from WT and Bmp2+/-; Bmp6-/- mice at 3 weeks of age were disseminated into a six-well plate at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml and cultured in osteogenic medium for 5, 10, and 15 days in the presence or absence of rhBMP2 at 200 ng/ml. Subsequently, cells were fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin and subjected to the ALP or von Kossa stainings as described above. Colonies consisting of more than 50 cells were defined as CFU-F, and ALP-positive CFU-F were defined as CFU-ALP. Bone nodules were counted on a grid under low power microscopy. Statistical Analysis—The means of the groups were compared by analysis of variance, and the significance of differences was determined by post-hoc testing using Bonferronis method. BMP Subtypes Expressed by Hypertrophic Chondrocytes—To determine the BMP subtypes expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes, we performed in situ hybridization for BMPs known to be expressed in chondrocytes (5Karsenty G. Ernesto Canalis M.D. Skeletal Growth Factors. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2000: 291-310Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous report (8Chung U.I. Schipani E. McMahon A.P. Kronenberg H.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), the main BMP subtypes expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes were BMP2 and BMP6 (Fig. 1A). As for the other BMPs examined, BMP4 was weakly expressed in the prehypertrophic chondrocytes, BMP7 in the proliferating chondrocytes, and GDF5 in the periarticular proliferating chondrocytes. Analysis of Fetal Bmp2-/-;Bmp6-/- Mice—To investigate the roles of the enodogenous BMP2 and BMP6 during bone formation, we generated their compound-deficient mice by appropriate mating. Because of the early embryonic lethality of Bmp2-/- mice, we studied the bone phenotypes of Bmp2+/-;Bmp6-/- mice. To macroscopically visualize bone and cartilage elements, whole embryos at E17.5 were double stained with Alizarin red and Alcian blue (Fig. 1B). The staining revealed a normal skeletal patterning in the single deficient (Bmp2+/- and Bmp6-/-) and the compound-deficient mice. However, the size of the compound-deficient mice was smaller than that of WT mice, whereas that of the single deficient mice was not. Temporal profiles of the body length and weight of the compound-deficient mice showed an ∼5% decrease in axial growth and body weight throughout life (Fig. 1C). Histological analysis of the growth plate of the proximal tibias from the E17.5 WT and Bmp2+/-;Bmp6-/- mice disclosed that the size of the compound-deficient growth plate was smaller than that of WT (643 ± 17 versus 723 ± 24 μm, p < 0.05), but the proportions of the distinct layers of the growth plate chondrocytes were not significantly different between the two groups (the layer of proliferating chondrocytes, 72.9 ± 2.3 versus 72.1 ± 2.6%; the layer of hypertrophic chondrocytes, 27.1 ± 0.8 versus 27.9 ± 0.9%) (Fig. 1D). Immunohistochemistry of the type II and X collagens showed no remarkable difference between the two groups (Fig. 1E). To evaluate bone formation in the fetal growth plate, we performed immunohistochemistry and real-time RT-PCR detecting the type I collagen (Fig. 1F) and von Kossa staining (Fig. 1G). The type I collagen immunoreactivity and type I collagen mRNA expression in the tibia were similar between the compound-deficient and WT mice. The von Kossa staining revealed that the mineralized area in the primary spongiosa of the compound-deficient mice was reduced in comparison with that of WT, although the mineralized area in the hypertrophic layer was similar between the two groups. The number of osteoclasts of the compound-deficient mice was not significantly different from that of WT (data not shown). During endochondral bone formation, osteogenesis is influenced by chondrogenesis. To rule out the possibility that the reduced mineralization of the primary spongiosa of the compound-deficient mice was because of a cartilage defect, we investigated whether chondrocytes reached terminal differentiation by examining the onset of hypertrophic differentiation and cartilage mineralization. H&E staining, immunohistochemical analysis with anti-type X collagen and MMP-13 antibodies, and von Kossa staining of the metatarsal bone sections at E15.5 showed that neither hypertrophic differentiation nor cartilage mineralization occurred in WT or compound-deficient mice (Fig. 1H). At E16.5, chondrocytes in the center of the cartilage underwent hypertrophic differentiation, expressing type X collagen and mineralizing the surrounding matrix in both WT and Bmp2+/-; Bmp6-/- mice. MMP-13, a marker of terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes (21D'Angelo M. Yan Z. Nooreyazdan M. Pacifici M. Sarment D.S. Billings P.C. Leboy P.S. J. Cell.

Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2005; 13: 632-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), just began to be expressed in both groups. At E17.5, MMP-13 expression was markedly up-regulated, the area of the mineralized cartilaginous matrix was increased, and the bone collar was formed in both groups. Thus, no abnormality of terminal differentiation of the chondrocytes was detected in the compound-deficient mice. Taken together, these data suggest that the differentiation/function of osteoblasts is impaired by the compound deficiency of Bmp2 and Bmp6. Analysis of Adult Bmp2+/-;Bmp6-/- Mice—We then investigated whether the compound deficiency of Bmp2 and Bmp6 had effects on the bone metabolism in adult mice. X-rays of the femur at 9 weeks of age showed that the lengths of the femur and the tibia were shorter and that the trabecular bone volume was reduced in Bmp2+/-;Bmp6+/- mice compared with that in WT (Fig. 2A). Quantitative analysis of the BMD disclosed that the femoral BMD of the compound-deficient mice was reduced compared with that of WT, whereas that of Bmp2+/-, Bmp6+/-, Bmp6-/-, or Bmp2+/-;Bmp6+/- mice was not significantly different from that of WT (Fig. 2B). Three-dimensional CT analysis manifested a marked reduction in the trabecular bone volume of the compound-deficient mice (Fig. 2C). Next, to investigate the role of endogenous Bmp2 and Bmp6 in intramembranous bone formation, the calvarias were examined. X-ray of the calvarias at 9 weeks of age from WT, Bmp2+/-, Bmp6-/-, and Bmp2+/-;Bmp6-/- mice did not show any significant difference (Fig. 2D), which was confirmed by the quantitative analysis of the BMD (Fig. 2E). Histological analysis with von Kossa staining of the proximal tibia revealed a trabecular bone loss in Bmp2+/-;Bmp6-/- mice compared with that in WT (Fig. 3A). Although there was no significant difference in the proportions of the growth plates or in the cartilaginous mineralization between the two groups, the mineralization in the primary spongiosa was notably reduced in the compound-deficient mice (Fig. 3B). To analyze the mechanism of the bone loss in detail, bone histomorphometric analysis was performed on the tibias (Fig. 3C). The bone volume and cortical thickness of the compound-deficient mice were found to be decreased compared with those of WT. Regarding the parameters of bone formation, the mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate per bone surface were markedly decreased with no remarkable difference in the osteoblast number expressed by Ob.S/BS. On the other hand, the parameters of bone resorption were normal. These data suggest that the bone loss in the compound-deficient mice is caused by the inhibition of the bone formation because of the impaired osteoblast function. To rule out the possibility that the bone loss of these mice was caused by general conditions, such as renal failure or abnormal calcium homeostasis, the serum biochemical data were analyzed. There was no remarkable difference in the serum creatinine, calcium, or inorganic phosphorus between WT and compound-deficient mice (data not shown). Urinary deoxypyridinoline, a marker for bone resorption, showed no remarkable difference between the two groups, confirm"
https://openalex.org/W2058255189,"Chromatin structure is a fundamental component of gene regulation, expression, and cellular differentiation. We have previously reported that the multifunctional coactivator p300 is a member of the Sox9 (Sry-type high mobility group box 9)-related transcriptional apparatus and activates Sox9-dependent transcription during chondrogenesis. However, the mechanism of synergy between Sox9 and p300 in chromatin-mediated transcription has not been elucidated. In the present study we investigated the activity of Sox9 and p300 on chromatinized templates in vitro. Recombinant Sox9 was shown to be associated with several transcriptional cofactors including p300. In vitro transcription assays revealed that p300 potentiated Sox9-dependent transcription on chromatinized DNA and, importantly, was associated with hyperacetylated histones. Consistent with these results, the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A stimulated the expression of Sox9-regulated cartilage matrix genes and induced histone acetylation around the enhancer region of the collagen α1 (II) gene in chondrocytes. These findings suggest that Sox9 interacts with chromatin and activates transcription via regulation of chromatin modification.

The eukaryotic genome is packaged into chromatin in which DNA wraps around the surface of a histone octamer (two sets of histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) and forms the nucleosome-repeated structure (11Li E.

These inhibitory effects can be reversed by the activity of chromatin remodeling factors. In vitro chromatin assembly and transcription assays have been very useful in elucidating the effects of chromatin structure on gene expression. Several proteins have been identified as important factors for regulating chromatin assembly and modification. In vitro chromatin assembly requires factors such as nucleosome assembly protein-1 (NAP-1), which acts as a histone-shuttling protein (14Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell.

Additionally, the ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor (ACF), consisting of Acf1 and ISWI subunits, assembles periodic nucleosome arrays on histone-attached DNA in an ATP-dependent process (15Nakagawa T.

Factors that regulate histone modifications (including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation) have a critical role in regulating chromatin structure and, by extension, transcription (11Li E.

In transcriptional events regulated by CREB or MyoD, for example, the acetylation of histone tails is a crucial step for relaxing the condensed chromatin structure leading to activation. CBP/p300 has intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and modulates the function of its associated transcription factors (22Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T.

Protein concentrations were measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation analyses using purified recombinant proteins were performed with anti-Sox9 or Smad2/3 antibody in 1× buffer D as described (35Canettieri G. Morantte I. Guzman E. Asahara H.

Briefly, indicated amounts of recombinant proteins and/or nuclear extracts were incubated for 1 h at 25°C. Ten percent of the reaction volume was loaded as an input fraction. Half of the mixture was incubated with each antibody and protein A beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4°C. The remaining mixture was incubated with rabbit IgG or anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) as a control. Purification of Histones and Recombinant Proteins—Core histones were purified from HeLa nuclear extracts and dialyzed in HEG buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA). Histidine-tagged NAP-1, FLAG-tagged ISWI, and Acf-1 were isolated from baculovirus (16Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T.

Sox9 and Smad3/4 were made using the BaculoDirect system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Recombinant NAP-1 was produced in Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic resin (Invitrogen) as described (36Ito T. Ikehara T. Nakagawa T. Kraus W.L. Muramatsu M.

Recombinant Smad3/4 was purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells after 30-min treatments of transforminggrowthfactor-β3(R&DSystems).Purifiedproteinswereassessed by silver stain (Bio-Rad) and Western blotting analyses. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—An electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed essentially as described previously (31Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Col2a1 enhancer probe containing the Sox9-binding site (in capital letters) was generated by annealing the oligonucleotides 5′-gcgcttgagaaaagcccCATTCATgagaggc-3′ and 5′-gcctctcATGAATGgggcttttctcaagcgc-3′. Probes were 32P end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). Purified Sox9 (30 ng) was incubated with the labeled probe (0.8 pmol). The unlabeled Col2a1 enhancer probe (16 pmol) was used as a competitor. In supershift analysis a 15-min treatment with anti-Sox9 antibody (0.2 μg) was performed before protein-DNA binding reactions. Luciferase Reporter Assay—12× 48-pGL3P was used as a reporter gene for investigating the Sox9-dependent transcriptional activity. Plasmids (20 ng, except for 60 ng of p300) were transiently transfected into SW1353 cells using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science). pRL-CMV (5 ng, Promega) was used as an internal control. The cells were harvested for 24 h after transfection, and then the luciferase activities were analyzed using Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) as described previously (10Furumatsu T. Tsuda M. Taniguchi N. Tajima Y. Asahara H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8343-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The assays were performed in triplicate. Chromatin Assembly and Micrococcal Nuclease Assay—Chromatin assembly and micrococcal nuclease digestion analyses were performed as described (37Asahara H. Tartare-Deckert S. Nakagawa T. Ikehara T. Hirose F. Hunter T. Ito T. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2974-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using 12× 48-pGL3P. For chromatin reconstitution, standard reactions (20 μl) containing plasmid (150 ng), histones (100 ng), NAP-1 (500 ng), ISWI/Acf-1 (0.65 ng each), ATP (3 mm), and ATP regeneration systems (30 mm phosphocreatine and 20 ng of creatine phosphokinase) were incubated at 30 °C for 4 h. In micrococcal nuclease assays, chromatinized plasmids (300 ng) were digested with micrococcal nuclease (0, 0.02, and 0.04 units/15 μl) for 5 min at 37 °C. In Vitro Transcription and S1 Nuclease Assay—After chromatin assembly, standard reactions (12× 48-pGL3P, 150 ng) were incubated with Sox9 (10 ng), p300 (30 ng), and acetyl-coenzyme A (Acetyl-CoA, 5 μm) for 30 min at 30 °C. For in vitro transcription, SW1353 nuclear extracts (30 μg) were added and incubated with ribonucleoside triphosphates at 30 °C for 40 min. pRL-CMV (100 ng) was used as an internal control. In vitro transcribed RNAs were recovered and subjected to S1 nuclease analyses using the following specific primers against each luciferase gene: 5′-GCAGTTGCTCTCCAGCGGTT CCATCTTCCAGCGGATAGAATGGCGCCGG-3′ (49 bp) for 12× 48-pGL3P and 5′-CCCACCACTGCGGACCAGTTATCATCCGTTTCCTTTGTTCTGG-3′ (43 bp) for pRL-CMV. RNAs were annealed with 32P end-labeled primers (0.2 pmol each) for 12 h and then digested with 50 units of S1 nuclease (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. The protected fragments were run on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Each experiment was performed at least three times. Histone Acetyltransferase Assay—After chromatin assembly (12× 48-pGL3P, 600 ng), purified Sox9 (20 ng) and/or p300 (60 ng) was added to the reaction mixtures with 14C-Acetyl-CoA (1 μm, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated for 1 h at 30°C in the absence of unlabeled Acetyl-CoA. Reactions were stopped by boiling in loading buffer and analyzed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with GelCode Blue reagents (Pierce) and then dried and exposed to autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Human chondrocytes (2× 106 cells) were maintained in the presence or absence of TSA (300 nm) for 4 h. The procedures used for analysis were described previously (29Alsalameh S. Amin R. Gemba T. Lotz M. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 1522-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) except for protein A beads and anti-acetyl-histone H3(Lys-9) and H4(Lys-8) antibodies (Cell Signaling). Rabbit IgG was used as a control. Input fractions were loaded as 10% volume of samples. PCR analyses were performed using the specific primer set for amplifying the COL2A1 enhancer region (29Alsalameh S. Amin R. Gemba T. Lotz M. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 1522-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Recombinant Sox9 Associates with p300 and Binds to the Col2a1 Enhancer in Vitro—Col2a1 was detected in human chondrocytes but not in MSCs (Fig. 1, A and B). To assess the role of CBP/p300 in Sox9-dependent transcription during chondrogenesis, we first compared the amount of Sox9 complex in chondrocytes and human MSCs. Both SOX9 and p300 were highly expressed in mature chondrocytes but only weakly detected in MSCs (Fig. 1C). Higher amounts of Smad2/3/4 were also detected in the nuclear extracts of chondrocytes (supplemental Fig. 1A, available in the on-line version of this article). The correlation between the high expression of p300 and Col2a1 in chondrocytes supports our previous findings that p300 is involved in Sox9-dependent transcription of its target gene, Col2a1 (8Tsuda M. Takahashi S. Takahashi Y. Asahara H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27224-27229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Because p300 can acetylate histones and activate transcription, we monitored the effect of p300 on Sox9-dependent transcriptional initiation using a chromatinized target gene. To do this, we employed an in vitro reconstituted transcription system. First, we purified histones from HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. 2A, available in the on-line version of this article) and components from baculovirus, namely chromatin assembly-related molecules (NAP-1 and ACF complex; supplemental Fig. 2, B and C), Sox9 (supplemental Fig. 2D), and p300 (supplemental Fig. 2E). Purified NAP-1 and ACF assembled chromatin in the presence of DNA, histones, and ATP regenerating conditions. We verified the assembly of chromatin in vitro by micrococcal nuclease digestion assay (data not shown). We also examined whether purified Sox9 would interact with cofactors p300 and tested the ability of recombinant Sox9 to bind to the Col2a1 gene by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (data not shown) as reported previously (8Tsuda M.

Based on these results, we decided to analyze the transcriptional activity of the Sox9 complex on a chromatinized template. Sox9 and p300 Cooperatively Activate the Chromatin-mediated Transcription in Vitro—We assessed the formation of the Sox9 protein complex on chromatin assembled in vitro using several different nuclear extracts. Consistent with our previous reports (8Tsuda M. Takahashi S. Takahashi Y. Asahara H. J. Biol.

However, these proteins were not co-immunoprecipitated with purified Sox9 in MSC nuclear extracts (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that Sox9-associating molecules are present during chondrogenesis. Next, we investigated the function of the Sox9 complex in vitro using chondrocyte and SW1353 extracts on chromatinized template DNA. In our assays with chromatinized templates, Sox9 was able to activate transcription of target DNA (Fig. 3B, lane 8). Consistent with the presence of Sox9 in this nuclear extract (Fig. 2), p300 was able to weakly activate transcription (Fig. 3B, lane 9), which may be due to complex formation between endogenous Sox9 and recombinant p300. In fact, the addition of p300 potentiated the transcriptional activation by recombinant Sox9 (Fig. 3B, lane 10), clearly demonstrating that both p300 and Sox9 were necessary for activation of chromatin-mediated transcription (Fig. 3B, lane 10). In contrast, no significant differences were observed between Sox9- and Sox9/p300-treated samples in histone-free closed circular plasmids (Fig. 3B, section labeled Histone-free DNA). We confirmed these results in vivo using a reporter plasmid containing tandem copies of the Sox9 binding site. In reporter assays, the addition of p300 increased the relative luciferase activity in a Sox9-dependent manner, but not in assays using the p300-HAT-deficient mutant p300DHAT (Fig. 3C, line labeled Sox9, bars labeled 1–507). Sox9 182–507, which lacks the DNA-binding domain, was unaffected by the presence or absence of p300 (Fig. 3C, line labeled Sox9, bars labeled 182–507). In addition, the p300-binding domain of Sox9 (amino acids 328–507) was necessary for the p300-mediated transactivation (Fig. 3C, line labeled Sox9, bars labeled 1–327). These results suggest that the altered chromatin structure caused by the HAT activity of p300 may have an important role for the Sox9-dependent transcription. Sox9-dependent Transcription Is Regulated by p300-mediated Histone Acetylation on Chromatin—Next, we explored the relationship between p300-induced histone acetylation and Sox9-dependent transcriptional activation on naked or chromatinized DNA. Because p300-mediated acetylation requires Acetyl co-A as a substrate, we performed in vitro transcription assays in the presence and absence of Acetyl co-A. The addition of Acetyl-CoA had no significant effect on in vitro transcription of a naked DNA template (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–5). In contrast, the absence of Acetyl-CoA severely reduced Sox9-dependent transcription after chromatin assembly (Fig. 4B, lanes 6–8). Additionally, p300 failed to stimulate the Sox9-dependent transcription in the absence of Acetyl-CoA (Fig. 4B, lanes 9 and 10). In HAT assays, free histones were acetylated by p300 even in the absence of Sox9 (Fig. 4C, section labeled Free Histones, top photograph). However, both p300 and Sox9 synergistically acetylated histones, which were assembled on a chromatin template (Fig. 4C, section labeled Chromatin, top photograph). These findings suggest that Sox9-regulated gene expression and subsequent chondrogenesis might be induced by chromatin acetylation through p300 recruitment by Sox9. Histone Hyperacetylation Activates Cartilage Matrix Gene Expression in Chondrocytes—To assess the relationship between COL2A1 expression and histone acetylation on the COL2A1 enhancer region, we used the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA to induce histone hyperacetylation in human chondrocytes. TSA treatments stimulated COL2A1 expression in chondrocytes (Fig. 5A). The expression of Aggrecan, one of the cartilage-specific matrix genes regulated by Sox9, was also enhanced by TSA treatments (Fig. 5B). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that histones H3 and H4 around the COL2A1 enhancer region were highly acetylated by TSA treatments (Fig. 5C). These results also suggest that Sox9-dependent transcription might be activated by histone acetylation during chondrocyte differentiation and maturation. The present study demonstrates that the p300 HAT activity modulates the Sox9-dependent transcription on the assembled chromatin. Our findings suggest that p300-mediated chromatin modifications are important steps for the induction of chondrogenesis (21Dilworth F.J. Seaver K.J. Fishburn A.L. Htet S.L. Tapscott S.J. Proc. Natl.

The transcriptional regulatory property of p300 is exerted through several mechanisms. p300 acts as a protein scaffold and bridging factor for forming multicomponent complexes and connecting DNA-binding transcription factors to the transcription apparatus. In addition, the intrinsic HAT activity of p300 has the potential to facilitate the transcriptional activation by histone modification (23Utley R.T. Ikeda K. Grant P.A. Cote J. Steger D.J.

However, it is not fully known if p300-HAT activity regulates transcription by altering chromatin structure during chondrogenesis. In this report we investigated the function of p300 in Sox9-dependent transcription using an in vitro chromatin assembly model.

In our chromatin assembly assays, p300 stimulated Sox9-dependent transcription through the modification of histone acetylation (Fig. 4, B and C). These findings suggest that p300-dependent histone acetylation regulates chondrogenesis. Animal models have revealed a fundamental role for p300 in embryonic development. The p300 (–/–) and p300 (+/–) mice show embryonic lethal phenotypes (40Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Ch'ng L.E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R.

In addition, Cbp heterozygous mice and Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (a heterozygous mutation in CBP allele) show skeletal abnormalities (41Petrij F. Giles R.H. Dauwerse H.G. Saris J.J. Hennekam R.C.

From these observations, embryogenesis and cellular differentiation might be regulated by gene dosage and overlapping roles of p300 and CBP. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that the amount of p300 in multi-potential human MSCs was lower than that in human chondrocytes (Fig. 1C). In vitro immunoprecipitation analyses showed purified Sox9 associated with p300 in chondrogenic cells (Fig. 2, sections labeled Chondrocytes and SW1353 cells) but not in MSCs (data not shown). Because the Sox9-regulated Col2a1 expression is increased by p300 (8Tsuda M. Takahashi S. Takahashi Y. Asahara H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27224-27229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 10Furumatsu T. Tsuda M. Taniguchi N. Tajima Y. Asahara H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8343-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that gene dosage-dependent regulation by p300 might modulate chondrogenesis through association with Sox9. We demonstrated previously that Smad3 and PGC-1α regulate Col2a1 expression by associating with Sox9 and p300 (9Kawakami Y. Tsuda M. Takahashi S. Taniguchi N. Esteban C.R. Zemmyo M. Furumatsu T.

In this study, purified Sox9 formed a protein complex with endogenous Smad3, PGC-1α, and p300 in vitro (Fig. 2). Recent observations support the idea that transcription is regulated by multi-protein complexes that associate with DNA-binding transcription factors (26Kitagawa H. Fujiki R. Yoshimura K. Mezaki Y.

To understand the precise mechanism of Sox9-dependent gene expression, it would be useful to purify the whole Sox9-related molecular complex from chondrocytes and analyze its function on chromatin templates. Cartilage matrix proteins have important roles in the maintenance and organization of chondrocyte phenotypes. The presences of cartilage-specific matrix proteins in the cell signify the developmental stages of chondrogenesis. Many of these are regulated by the sequence-specific transcription factor Sox9 (6Bell D.M. Leung K.K. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S. Ling K.W. Sham M.H. Koopman P. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Nat.

The expression of the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein gene is down-regulated by histone deacetylase-1 but increased by the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA (48Liu C.J. Prazak L. Fajardo M. Yu S. Tyagi N. Di Cesare P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47081-47091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), indicating that histone acetylation is involved in gene expression. However, there are few reports that describe the functional link between histone acetylation and Sox9-regulated gene expression in chondrogenesis. In this study, we demonstrated that TSA treatments enhanced the expression of COL2A1 and Aggrecan in chondrocytes (Fig. 5, A and B) and also increased the acetylation levels of histone H3/H4 around the COL2A1 enhancer region containing the Sox9-binding site (Fig. 5C). In contrast, no significant differences in the expression of COL2A1 and Aggrecan in human MSCs was observed after TSA treatments (data not shown). These findings indicate that TSA-induced histone hyperacetylation stimulates Sox9-regulated gene expression and support our findings that p300-mediated histone acetylation promotes Sox9-dependent transcription and chondrogenesis. Further investigation of the switching mechanism between histone deacetylase and p300 and the effect on Sox9 may provide a novel therapeutic target for cartilaginous diseases, including osteoarthritis.

https://openalex.org/W2020290247,"The crossing of two electronic potential surfaces (a conical intersection) should result in geometric phase effects even for molecular processes confined to the lower surface. However, recent quantum simulations of the hydrogen exchange reaction (H + H2 --> H2 + H) have predicted a cancellation in such effects when product distributions are integrated over all scattering angles. We used a simple topological argument to extract reaction paths with different senses from a nuclear wave function that encircles a conical intersection. In the hydrogen-exchange reaction, these senses correspond to paths that cross one or two transition states. These two sets of paths scatter their products into different regions of space, which causes the cancellation in geometric phase effects. The analysis should generalize to other direct reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2095266989,"Dopamine transporter (DAT) localization in dopaminergic neurons plays an important role in regulating dopamine signaling. However, the mechanisms of DAT trafficking that control DAT localization are still poorly understood. To gain insight into these mechanisms, human DAT was purified in large amounts using a two-step affinity chromatography procedure from untreated HeLa cells or cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Mass spectrometric analysis of purified DAT complexes revealed the presence of several proteins, among which ubiquitin was particularly abundant in the PMA-treated sample. Western blotting of highly purified DAT protein confirmed constitutive ubiquitylation of DAT and a dramatic increase in DAT ubiquitylation in cells treated with PMA. This increase was blocked by pretreatment with the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor bis-indolylmaleimide. DAT ubiquitylation by ectopically expressed ubiquitin was demonstrated in cells transiently transfected with yellow fluorescent protein-tagged ubiquitin. In addition, fluorescence resonance energy transfer was detected between cyan fluorescent protein-tagged DAT and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged ubiquitin, indicative of DAT-ubiquitin conjugation. Interestingly, the largest fluorescence resonance energy transfer signals were observed in endosomes. Ubiquitylated DAT was detected in the plasma membrane using cell surface biotinylation as well as in intracellular compartments, suggesting that ubiquitylation begins at the plasma membrane and is maintained in endosomes. In both porcine aortic endothelial and HeLa cells, where PKC-dependent DAT ubiquitylation was observed, PKC activation resulted in rapid degradation of DAT (t12 = 1-2 h). Altogether, these data suggest that PKC-induced DAT ubiquitylation may target DAT to lysosomal degradation."

PCs were considered to be redundant because a large body of in vitro work had shown that several PCs could cleave the same substrate. Recently, lessons from the studies of neural apoptosis-regulated convertase 1 (NARC-1), a newly discovered PC (10Cohen J. Pertsemlidis A. Kotowski I.K. Graham R. Garcia C.K. Hobbs H.H. Nat.

However, the substrate of NARC-1 is not yet identified. Endothelial lipase (EL) is a recently described modulator of lipoprotein metabolism that belongs to the triglyceride lipase family, which also includes lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) (12Wong H. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 993-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Like LPL and HL, the EL protein is secreted and binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the endothelial cell surface, where it interacts with lipoproteins (13Choi S.Y. Hirata K. Ishida T.

Fuki I.V. Marchadier D. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1554-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). EL protein was detected in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages in human atherosclerotic lesions (21Azumi H. Hirata K. Ishida T. Kojima Y. Rikitake Y. Takeuchi S. Inoue N. Kawashima S. Hayashi Y. Itoh H. Quertermous T. Yokoyama M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 58: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Unlike LPL and HL, EL is up-regulated in response to cytokines, shear stress, and cyclic stretch (22Hirata K. Ishida T. Matsushita H. Tsao P.S. Quertermous T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Jin W. Sun G.S. Marchadier D. Octtaviani E. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. Circ.

Yamashita T. Hirata K.I. Kojima Y. Yokoyama M. Cooper A.D. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45085-45092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two major forms of the EL protein, the full-length and a smaller form, are detected in conditioned media from endothelial cells by Western blotting using an anti-hEL peptide antibody generated against an N-terminal peptide (16Jaye M. Lynch K.J. Krawiec J. Marchadier D. Maugeais C. Doan K. South V. Amin D. Perrone M. Rader D.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Expression of EL cDNA in vitro and in vivo results in generation of the same two proteins (25Maugeais C. Tietge U.J. Broedl U.C. Marchadier D. Cain W. McCoy M.G. Lund-Katz S. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the smaller form of EL is the product of a specific proteolytic cleavage of the full-length protein. In this report, we document the site of this processing, elucidate the specific sequence requirements, demonstrate that specific PCs are responsible for the cleavage of EL, show that cleavage reduced EL activity, and provide evidence that LPL is also cleaved by PCs. Materials—We obtained horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (affinity-purified) from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, monoclonal anti-myc (IgG fraction) from the culture medium of hybridoma clone 9E10 (American Type Culture Collection), human embryonic kidney HEK293 cell line from American Type Culture Collection, BisTris NuPage Gels (10% resolving gel; 4% stacking gel) from Invitrogen, peptides, anti-FLAG-M2 (anti-FLAG) antibody from Sigma, Lipofectamine Transfection reagent from Invitrogen, SuperScript Plasmid System for cDNA Synthesis and Plasmid Cloning from Roche, and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone, cholchicine, monensin, and brefeldin A from Calbiochem. l-[35S]Methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and glycosidase H was obtained from New England Biolabs. Endothelial cells were purchased from Clonetics. Decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (DPC) was obtained from Bachem. Anti-LPL antibody (5D2) was kindly provided by Dr. John Brunzell (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Cell Culture—Monolayers of HEK293 cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. For transient transfection, cells were set up on day 0 (1.3 × 105 cells/well on a 6-well plate). On day 2, cells were transfected with 1 μg of the indicated plasmid using Lipofectamine in 1 ml of Opti-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Five hours after transfection, 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum was added into each well. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 10 units/ml of heparin (Sigma). The culture media were collected at 48 h post-transfection. The media collected with heparin are referred to as conditioned media. After incubation for 48 h, the cells were harvested, resuspended in 450 μl of buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected. For adenoviral infection, 3000 particles per cell were used for COS-7 cells, and 800 particles per cell were applied for HUVECs. Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were carried out as described (23Jin W. Sun G.S. Marchadier D. Octtaviani E. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were a rabbit polyclonal antibody against human EL peptide (amino acids 8–23) and mouse monoclonal antibodies against myc or FLAG. Treatment of samples with heparin-Sepharose beads was carried out as previously reported (16Jaye M. Lynch K.J. Krawiec J. Marchadier D. Maugeais C. Doan K. South V. Amin D. Perrone M. Rader D.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). F, N, and C denote the full uncleaved precursor form, the cleaved N-terminal fragment of EL, and the cleaved C-terminal fragment of EL, respectively. PC Processing of EL and LPL in HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells stably expressing myc-tagged EL or transiently expressing myc-tagged LPL were transiently transfected with pIRE2-EGFP recombinant cDNAs coding for each of the convertases: furin, PACE4, PC5A, PC5A-ΔC (lacking the Cys-rich domain), PC5B, PC7, SKI-1, and NARC-1. Two days post-transfections, cells were pulse-labeled for 3 h in the presence of [35S]Met + Cys. Cell media were subjected to immunoprecipitated with the anti-myc antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and then autoradiographed, as reported (8Seidah N.G.

Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—One microgram of total RNA was converted into cDNA using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All primers designed were identical to the previous report (29Cheng M. Watson P.H. Paterson J.A. Seidah N. Chretien M. Shiu R.P. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 966-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Production of Lentiviral Vectors and Generation of HUVEC Stably Expressing Small Hairpin RNAs—All recombinant lentiviruses were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells according to standard protocols (Invitrogen). Briefly, the VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were produced by transient transfection of HEK293 cells (5 × 106) plated in 100-mm dishes. A pLenti6/BLOCK-iT™-DEST construct (3 μg) and ViralPower™ Package Mix (9 μg) were cotransfected into 293T cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Various HUVEC lines stably expressing small hairpin RNAs were generated by transduction with lenti-small hairpin luciferase, lenti-small hairpin furin, and lenti-small hairpin PC5 and selected in the presence of 6 μg/ml of Blasticidin. The target sequences were shown as follows: for luciferase, 5′-CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3′; for furin, 5′-GTTCACCCTCGTACTCTAT-3′; for PC5, 5′-TGATGCAAGCAACGAGAAC-3′. Lipase Activity Assays—The lipoprotein binding assays were performed as previously described (30Fuki I.V. Blanchard N. Jin W. Marchadier D.H. Millar J.S. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34331-34338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Both triglyceride lipase and phospholipase activities were assayed as previously described (31McCoy M.G. Sun G.S. Marchadier D. Maugeais C. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EL Is Proteolytically Cleaved—Conditioned media from various types of human endothelial cells were treated with heparin-Sepharose beads, and proteins bound to the beads were subjected to immunoblotting using an anti-hEL antibody that detects only the N-terminal epitope of EL (Fig. 1B). All of the endothelial cells tested expressed EL as demonstrated by the presence of an immunoreactive 68-kDa form of EL. In addition, the media also contained a 40-kDa protein recognized by this same antibody (Fig. 1A). The ratio of 40/68-kDa forms of EL differed considerably among the different endothelial cells, suggesting that the processing of EL is cell-type dependent. We hypothesized that the 40-kDa protein was derived from full-length EL by proteolytic cleavage. To identify the C-terminal cleavage product of EL, we prepared cDNAs encoding full-length EL with either a C-terminal myc-His tag (ELmyc) or a FLAG tag version of human EL (ELflag) (see supplemental experimental procedures). After transfection in HEK293 cells, the anti-N-terminal EL antibody detected full-length ELmyc or ELflag slightly larger than the untagged EL (Fig. 1C) as well as N-terminal 40-kDa fragments that were identical in size to untagged EL and to that found in endothelial cell media (Fig. 1C, lane 5). This suggests that EL is proteolytically cleaved even when expressed in cell types other than endothelial cells. The anti-myc antibody detected the full-length ELmyc as well as a smaller 33-kDa band, and the anti-FLAG antibody detected the full-length ELflag as well as a 33-kDa band (Fig. 1D). This suggests that the 33-kDa band represents the tagged C-terminal cleavage product. In side by side comparative studies, we demonstrated that the myc tag has no effect on EL processing (data not shown). To better understand the kinetics of cleavage of EL, stable HEK293 cells expressing human ELmyc were pulse-labeled in a chemically defined medium with [35S]methionine. EL was immunoprecipitated from media obtained at different time points using a polyclonal rabbit anti-adhEL antibody that recognizes both N- and C-terminal regions of EL (23Jin W. Sun G.S. Marchadier D. Octtaviani E. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As expected, more EL protein was recovered from the media in the presence of heparin. Control antibody did not pull down similar size bands (data not shown). Both in the presence and absence of heparin, the full-length ELmyc appeared in the medium first, with the smaller fragments appearing later (Fig. 1E). The ratio of 40/68-kDa forms of EL changed as a function of the incubation time, suggesting that the processing of EL is time-dependent. Processing of EL Requires a PC Consensus Sequence—To narrow down the site of cleavage, we prepared a series of truncated ELmyc constructs (Fig. 2A) (supplemental experimental procedures). An initial study verified that EL is cleaved between amino acids 297 and 346 (data not shown). cDNAs encoding the full-length EL and the truncated versions were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells. All of the truncated EL proteins as well as full-length EL were easily detected in the media with the anti-N-terminal EL antibody (Fig. 2B). The shorter truncation mutants Δ323 and Δ327 were easily detected by anti-myc antibody, but the longer Δ330 and Δ334 mutants were not detected with the same antibody (Fig. 2C). Thus, the loss of the C-terminal myc epitope through cleavage occurred between residues 327 and 330. This placed the cleavage in the hinge region between the N- and C-terminal domains of EL. In contrast to the limited processing of full-length of EL, all truncated forms of EL were either completely cleaved or completely uncleaved, indicating the importance of the C terminus of EL in regulating this process. To identify the precise cleavage site, we overexpressed full-length EL using a plasmid encoding ELmyc in HEK293 cells by transient transfection, purified proteins containing a His epitope from cell culture medium using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, separated these proteins by SDS-PAGE, and transferred them to membranes. The C terminus of ELmyc was confirmed by Western blotting. N-terminal sequencing (supplemental experimental procedures) of this protein revealed that the cleavage of EL occurs immediately after residue 330, the second arginine of an RNKR330 sequence (Fig. 2D). To determine the amino acid residues that are important for cleavage of EL, we made a systematic series of mutations in which alanine was individually substituted for the amino acids around the RNKR sequence. Fig. 2E shows representative results. Only two single alanine substitutions reduced EL cleavage: R327A (P4 mutant; partial cleavage) and the R330A (P1 mutant; no cleavage). Mutation of the positively charged arginine to lysine at position 327 still permitted EL cleavage, but substitution of lysine for arginine at position 330 abolished cleavage. In addition, two multiple alanine replacements abolished EL cleavage and all included the R330A substitution. These data indicate that arginine 327 at the P4 position relative to the cleavage site and arginine 330 at the P1 position are the only two residues in the region required for effective proteolytic processing, although we cannot rule out the importance of the P6 Lys325 that may compensate for the absence of a P4 arginine (8Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) and explain the partial cleavage seen in the R327A mutant. There is no dramatic change of EL secretion even though the cleavage is greatly inhibited by mutagenesis (data shown in Fig. 6). Deletion of asparagine 328 or insertion of alanine within the RNKR sequence did not affect secretion of the EL protein into the culture medium, but dramatically reduced EL cleavage (Fig. 2F). These data indicate that an intact RNKR sequence length is also required for effective EL cleavage. Processing of EL Occurs Both Intracellularly and Extracellularly—A stable HEK293 cell line expressing ELmyc was used to determine the subcellular location of the proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 3A). Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone, which interferes with transport of glycoproteins out of the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi (32Burkhardt J.K. Hester S. Argon Y. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 643-654PubMed Google Scholar), blocked secretion of full-length of EL into the medium but did not result in intracellular accumulation of the 40-kDa fragment in the cell lysate, indicating that proteolytic pathways associated with the endoplasmic reticulum do not participate in processing EL. Monensin, which interferes with intra-Golgi vesicular transport (33Tartakoff A.M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1026-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), and brefeldin A, which induces the fusion of the rough endoplasmic reticulum with the early Golgi compartment (34Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.G. Hauri H.P. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), also did not result in intracellular accumulation of the N-terminal fragment. These results demonstrate that proteolytic processing of the EL is unlikely to occur prior to the trans Golgi network. In contrast, colchicine, which interferes with post-Golgi transport (35Redman C.M. Banerjee D. Howell K. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 66: 42-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), resulted in substantial accumulation of the N-terminal fragment in the cell lysate, indicating that processing of EL can occur in the late Golgi. We could not detect an intracellular cleavage product of EL in HUVECs, which might be below the limit of detection using our antibody (data not shown). As another approach to study the intracellular proteolytic processing of EL, the endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) (36Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) was inserted at the C terminus of EL. Cells expressing the ELkdel construct had no secretion of EL into the media (data not shown) but had substantial EL in the cell extract (Fig. 3C). Endoglycosidase H sensitivity of EL further proved that ELkdel did not reach the Golgi (Fig. 3C). In the cells expressing wild type EL, the N-terminal fragment was clearly seen in the cell extract (Fig. 3C). In contrast, no N-terminal fragment was seen in cells expressing ELkdel. This suggests that cleavage occurs distal to the early Golgi and is consistent with the chemical inhibitor studies. Overall, these results suggest that proteolytic processing of EL is either a late intracellular or post-secretion event or both. When we treated the stable HEK293 cell line expressing ELmyc with 10 units/ml heparin at 4 °C for 30 min, mainly full-length EL is recovered from the conditioned medium (Fig. 3D, 0 h), suggesting that the secreted form of EL is largely full-length. To test whether extracellular proteolysis can occur, the medium containing full-length ELmyc was incubated at 37 °C in the absence or presence of HUVEC for up to 48 h. In the absence of cells, no full-length EL was proteolytically cleaved (data not shown). In the presence of cells, the full-length ELmyc was gradually converted to the 33-kDa C-terminal fragment with t½ about 12 h (Fig. 3D). Thus, HUVEC are able to secrete, or expose at the cell surface, the enzyme that cleaves EL. Proprotein Convertases Are Responsible for EL Cleavage—Because the sequence RNKR is a typical PC recognition site and PCs are known to be active after the late Golgi, we used PC inhibitors to study their effects on the proteolytic processing of EL. DPC (decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone) is a modified peptide that binds covalently to the substrate binding site of PCs and inhibits their activity (37Garten W. Stieneke A. Shaw E. Wikstrom P. Klenk H.D. Virology. 1989; 172: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine whether DPC affects the cleavage of EL, HEK293 cells transfected with a plasmid encoding hEL were treated with DPC for 24 h. As seen in Fig. 4A, DPC caused a reduction of cleavage of EL, without accumulation of the full-length EL. In contrast, EL cleavage was not affected by other serine protease inhibitors, including aprotinin (0.1 μm), leupeptin (1 μM), Pefabloc SC (1 mm), or a protease inhibitor mixture obtained from Roche (data not shown). The prosegments of furin and PC5A are potent autoinhibitors of PC activity by noncovalently attaching to PCs, and profurin as well as proPC5A inhibit both furin and PC5A (27Nour N. Basak A. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2886-2895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Zhong M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Benjannet S. Mowla S.J. Decroly E. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33913-33920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We investigated the ability of overexpressed profurin and proPC5A to inhibit the processing of EL. As seen in Fig. 4B, overexpression of either profurin or proPC5A resulted in a complete inhibition of EL cleavage. Another PC inhibitor, α1-PDX, was generated by mutating the reactive-site loop of α1-antitrypsin to contain the minimal consensus sequence for PCs cleavage (-R-I-P-R-) and to act as a competitive inhibitor (39Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We investigated the ability of overexpressed α1-PDX to inhibit the processing of EL. The processing of EL was apparent when COS-7 cells were infected with AdhEL alone, but co-expression of α1-PDX completely blocked EL cleavage (Fig. 4C). Importantly, the expression of α1-PDX also significantly reduced the processing of endogenous EL in HUVEC as compared with untreated or Ad-enhanced green fluorescent protein-infected samples (Fig. 4C). Because the RNKR sequence is the site of cleavage, a synthetic peptide corresponding to this site should competitively inhibit the processing of EL. We studied the effects of two peptides on the processing of EL after expressing ELmyc in HEK293 cells: peptide A, which contains the intact RXKR sequence, and as a control, peptide B, a mutant version containing an RNAA sequence. EL cleavage was substantially reduced by peptide A, whereas peptide B had no effect on cleavage (Fig. 4D). Because these peptides are not expected to enter the cells, this strongly suggests that substantial processing occurs either at the cell surface or in the medium. Only Some PCs Have the Ability to Cleave EL—To determine which member(s) of the PC family cleave EL, we transiently expressed, in the stable HEK293 cell line expressing ELmyc, each of the PCs individually. PACE4, PC5A, and furin were all found to generate substantial C-terminal fragment from full-length EL (Fig. 5A), but not PC5B, PC5ΔC (without the C-terminal Cys-rich domain) (5Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), PC7, SKI-1/S1P, or NARC-1. The C-terminal cleavage products of EL were immunoprecipitated and subjected to N-terminal protein sequencing. All contained EL sequence immed"

Here we demonstrated that the mechanism by which the ATF3 mRNA content is increased following amino acid limitation of human HepG2 hepatoma cells is mRNA stabilization. Analysis of ATF3 mRNA turnover revealed that the half-life was increased from about 1 h in control cells to greater than 8 h in the histidine-deprived state, demonstrating mRNA stabilization in response to nutrient deprivation. Treatment of HepG2 cells with thapsigargin, which causes endoplasmic reticulum stress, also increased the half-life of ATF3 mRNA. HuR is an RNA-binding protein that regulates both the stability and cytoplasmic/nuclear localization of mRNA species containing AU-rich elements. Another RNA-binding protein, AUF1, regulates target mRNA molecules by enhancing their decay. Amino acid limitation caused a slightly elevated mRNA level for HuR and AUF1 mRNA. The nuclear HuR protein content was unchanged, and AUF1 protein increased slightly after amino acid limitation, whereas the cytoplasmic levels of both HuR and AUF1 protein increased. Immunoprecipitation of HuR-RNA complexes followed by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that HuR interacted with ATF3 mRNA in vivo and that this interaction increased following amino acid limitation. In contrast, the interaction of AUF1 with the ATF3 mRNA is decreased in histidine-deprived cells relative to control cells. Suppression of HuR expression by RNA interference partially blocked the accumulation of ATF3 mRNA following amino acid deprivation. The results demonstrated that coordinated regulation of mRNA stability by HuR and AUF1 proteins contributes to the observed increase in ATF3 expression following amino acid limitation.

Suppression of HuR expression by RNA interference partially blocked the accumulation of ATF3 mRNA following amino acid deprivation. The results demonstrated that coordinated regulation of mRNA stability by HuR and AUF1 proteins contributes to the observed increase in ATF3 expression following amino acid limitation. Metabolite control of gene expression in mammalian cells is an important aspect of regulating cellular responses to changes in the nutritional status of the organism (1Straus D.S.

Another mechanism for increasing mRNA and protein expression following amino acid limitation is mRNA stabilization, which has been documented for the cationic amino acid transporter 1 (cat-1) (9Yaman I.

Chem. 2002; 277: 41539-41546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and the cell cycle regulatory protein p21 (8Leung-Pineda V. Pan Y. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Control of mRNA stability represents a critical regulatory mechanism of gene expression in mammalian cells that is not well understood. It is becoming evident that specific trans-acting factors bind to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of a given mRNA and thereby mediate control of mRNA degradation or stabilization. Among the RNA-binding proteins identified so far, HuR and its neuronal homologues HuB, HuC, and HuD have been associated with post-transcriptional stabilization of mRNA for cyclin, vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, c-Myc, interleukins, p21, p27, and p53 (20Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). In contrast, a number of other RNA-binding proteins, including TTP, BRF1, KSRP, AUF1/hnRNP D, and other members of the hnRNP family of proteins, function as destabilizers of the target mRNA to which they bind. The abundance and subcellular localization of HuR is altered by amino acid limitation, and it stabilizes cat-1 mRNA by binding to the 3′-UTR (9Yaman I. Fernandez J. Sarkar B. Schneider R.J.

ATF3 is a transcription factor for which expression is low in normal and quiescent cells, but can be rapidly induced in response to diverse stress signals, and is likely to be involved in controlling a wide variety of stress-related cellular activities (21Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar). Pan et al. (22Pan Y.-X. Chen H. Siu F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol.

Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1365-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the expression of ATF3 is induced in response to amino acid deprivation or to ER stress. Ron and co-workers (18Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol.

Recently, Wek and co-workers (23Jiang H.Y. Wek S.A. McGrath B.C. Lu D. Hai T. Harding H.P. Wang X. Ron D. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell.

The ATF3 transcript is also known to undergo alternative splicing yielding an extensive set of proteins of different sequence, coding frames, and length (22Pan Y.-X. Chen H. Siu F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38402-38412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Hashimoto Y. Zhang C. Kawauchi J. Imoto I. Adachi M.T. Inazawa J. Amagasa T. Hai T. Kitajima S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 32899-32904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The longest protein, full-length ATF3, can function as a homodimer, in which case it often acts to repress transcription, or as a heterodimer with other bZIP family members, in which case it can either repress or activate transcription (27Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Following amino acid deprivation, there is an increase in multiple ATF3 mRNA species that results from alternative splicing and a change in the ratio among these species (22Pan Y.-X. Chen H. Siu F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38402-38412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggesting that the splicing machinery is somehow regulated by amino acid availability. However, the net accumulation of ATF3 mRNA molecules could also involve increased stabilization, which is the hypothesis tested in this report. The experiments in this report establish that mRNA stability contributes to the increased ATF3 expression following amino acid limitation or ER stress and that specific RNA-binding proteins are involved in the regulation of the ATF3 stabilization. Analysis of ATF3 mRNA turnover revealed that the half-life was increased from about 1 h in HepG2 human hepatoma cells maintained in amino acid-complete medium, to greater than 8 h in histidine-deficient medium. ER stress also increased the half-life of ATF3 mRNA, from 1 to 3 h. Immunoprecipitation of HuR-RNA complexes followed by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that HuR interacts with the ATF3 mRNA in vivo and that the interaction of HuR with ATF3 mRNA increases following amino acid limitation. In contrast, the interaction of AUF1 with the ATF3 mRNA is slightly decreased in histidine-deprived cells relative to control cells. Furthermore, suppression of HuR protein expression using RNAi partially blocked the increased accumulation of ATF3 mRNA resulting from histidine limitation. These results show that HuR is involved in stress-induced ATF3 mRNA stabilization, whereas AUF1 may be a destabilizing factor for this ARE-containing mRNA molecule. Cell Culture—Human HepG2 hepatoma cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM, pH 7.4; Mediatech, Herndon, VA), supplemented to contain 1× nonessential amino acid solution, 4 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air incubator and were replenished with fresh MEM and serum 12 h prior to initiating all treatments. Nutrient deprivation was performed by incubating the cells in complete MEM or MEM lacking histidine (Invitrogen), each containing 10% dialyzed FBS. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For each sample, 2 μg of RNA was dried and resuspended in RNase-free H2O to make a final concentration of 50 ng/μl. To measure the relative amount of the ATF3 mRNA, real time quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed using a DNA Engine Opticon 2 system (MJ Research, Reno, NV), and the product was detected with SYBR Green I, as described previously (22Pan Y.-X. Chen H. Siu F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38402-38412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The primers for amplification were as follows: ATF3, sense 5′-GCTGTCACCACGTGCAGTATCTCA-3′ and antisense 5′-CTGTTCCTCCTCTTGCTGACAAGC-3′; AUF1, sense 5′-GGTGGTTTTGGTGAGGTGGAATC-3′ and antisense 5′-CCCACGCCTCTTATTGGTCTTGT-3′; and HuR, sense 5′-TTCACCACCAGGCGCAGAGA-3′ and antisense 5′-GAGCCCGCTCATGTGATCGA-3′. The reactions, containing 100 ng of total RNA, were incubated at 50 °C for 30 min followed by 95 °C for 15 min to activate the Taq polymerase, and then amplified for 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. After PCR, melting curves were acquired by stepwise increase of the temperature from 55 to 95 °C to ensure that a single product was amplified in the reaction. The mRNA level for ribosomal protein L7a was measured at the same time to serve as the internal control. The L7a primers for amplification were as follows: sense 5′-TTTGGCATTGGACAGGACATCC-3′ and antisense 5′-AGCGGGGCCATTTCACAAAG-3′. Samples from at least three independent experiments, each measured in duplicate, were analyzed and the data expressed as the averages ± S.E. Transfection and Reporter Assay of ATF3 3′-UTR Constructs—A 418-bp fragment of ATF3 3′-UTR mRNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into the XbaI site downstream of the luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3-Promoter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Transcription from this construct was driven by an SV40 promoter. To evaluate whether the ATF3 3′-UTR mediates mRNA stability in HepG2 cells, the luciferase reporter constructs with or without the ATF3 3′-UTR were individually transfected into HepG2 cells (1 μg of DNA per 2 × 106 cells in a 60-mm dish), using a calcium phosphate protocol (28Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). Twenty four hours after transfection, the cells were incubated in MEM without histidine for 12 h to enhance mRNA production and then transferred to either fresh histidine-free MEM or complete MEM, both containing 5 μm actinomycin D (ActD). At specific times, total cellular RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and luciferase mRNA content was assayed by qPCR. The luciferase primers for amplification were as follows: sense 5′-AGGCAAGGATATGGGCTCACT-3′ and antisense 5′-CATCCCCCTCGGGTGTAATC-3′. The rate of decay was analyzed graphically by using duplicate samples from at least three independent experiments and the data expressed as the averages ± S.E. Immunoblotting—Total cellular or nuclear protein extracts were collected at the time points indicated, placed in sample dilution buffer, and then 80 μg/lane of cellular protein extract or 20 μg/lane of nuclear protein extract were separated on a 10% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and electrotransferred to a Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), as described previously (22Pan Y.-X. Chen H. Siu F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38402-38412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After staining with Fast Green to check for equal loading, the membrane was incubated with 5% blocking solution (5% (w/v) Carnation nonfat dry milk, 30 mm Tris base, pH 7.5, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 200 mm NaCl) for 2 h at room temperature with mixing. Immunoblotting was performed using an antibody against HuR or AUF1 at a concentration of 0.8 μg/ml in 5% blocking solution by incubation for 2 h at room temperature (∼21 °C). Anti-AUF1 (catalog number sc22368) and anti-HuR (catalog number sc20694) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The blots were washed five times for 5 min in 1% dry milk blocking solution on a shaker and then incubated for 45 min at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) at a 1:5,000 dilution in 1% dry milk blocking solution. The blots were then washed five times for 5 min in 1% dry milk blocking solution and two times for 5 min in freshly made TBS/Tween (30 mm Tris base, 0.1% Tween 20, and 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). The bound secondary antibody was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) and exposing the blot to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak). RNA Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Immunoprecipitation of protein-RNA complexes was performed by a modified protocol for chromatin immunoprecipitation (29Liang G. Lin J.C. Wei V. Yoo C. Cheng J.C. Nguyen C.T. Weisenberger D.J. Egger G. Takai D. Gonzales F.A. Jones P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Briefly, HepG2 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 107/150-mm dish with complete MEM and grown for 24 h. Cells were transferred to fresh MEM 12 h before treatment and then incubated in either complete MEM or MEM lacking histidine (MEM-His), each containing 10% dialyzed FBS, for 8 h. After protein-RNA cross-linking with 1% formaldehyde, the cells were lysed with nuclei swelling buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and the nuclei were pelleted and discarded. Cytoplasmic extract equaling ∼20 × 106 cells was incubated at 4 °C overnight with 15 μg of either rabbit anti-chicken IgG (nonspecific control) or an antibody against either HuR or AUF1. Cytoplasmic extract not incubated with antibody was saved as an “input” sample. The antibody-bound complex was precipitated by protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and the beads were sequentially washed once each for 5 min with low salt, high salt, LiCl, and TE buffers (low salt wash: 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl; high salt wash: 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 500 mm NaCl; LiCl wash: 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; TE buffer: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA). The protein-RNA complex was eluted from the protein A-Sepharose beads with 250 μlof elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3) at 37 °C for 15 min. The RNA in the immunoprecipitated complex and the RNA in the previously saved input fraction were released by reversing the cross-linking at 65 °C for 2 h with 200 mm NaCl and 20 μg of proteinase K. The RNA was then extracted from the solution using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and subjected to RT-PCR using primers to amplify a sequence in the 3′-untranslated region of the human ATF3 mRNA (sense 5′-GCTGTCACCACGTGCAGTATCTCA-3′; antisense 5′-CTGTTCCTCCTCTTGCTGACAAGC-3′). RNA Interference Using a Vector-based Short Hairpin siRNA—An expression plasmid for an siRNA directed against HuR was constructed containing the U6 promoter region from nt –265 to +1, specific for RNA polymerase III, which was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA with the following primers: sense 5′-CGTAGTAACAATTGATCCGACGCCGCCATCTCT-3′ and antisense 5′-GCCGATGCTAGCGTCTCACAAACAAGGCTTTTCTCCAA-3′. A BsmBI site (underlined) in the antisense primer allowed insertion of siRNA sequences at the first nucleotide of the U6 transcript. The U6 promoter was cloned into the vector pcDNA3.1/zeo and named pcU6K. HuR-specific siRNA oligonucleotides were designed that contained a sense strand (5′-CTACCTCCCTCAGAACATGTTCAAGAGACATGTTCTGAGGGAGGTAG-3′) of nucleotide sequence followed by a short spacer (5′-TTCAAGAGA-3′), the reverse complement of the sense strand (5′-CTACCTCCCTCAGAACATGTCTCTTGAACATGTTCTGAGGTAG-3′), and then five thymidines as an RNA polymerase III transcriptional stop signal. The siRNA sequences were synthesized as two complementary DNA oligonucleotides, annealed, and then ligated into the BsmBI site of pcU6K. To ensure the effective depletion of HuR mRNA (more than 70%), two successive transfections with the short hairpin siRNA-containing plasmid were performed. Briefly, HepG2 cells were seeded at 1.0 × 106 per 60-mm dish with complete MEM and grown for 18 h before transfection using CaPO4 for 12 h (28Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). Eighteen hours after the first transfection, a second transfection was performed using Superfect for 3 h, as described (22Pan Y.-X. Chen H. Siu F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38402-38412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Total RNA and protein extracts from the transfected HepG2 cells were collected for analysis 24 h after the second transfection. Effect of Amino Acid Limitation on ATF3 mRNA Synthesis and Turnover—Although we observed previously that the ATF3 mRNA content of cells is increased after 12 h of amino acid limitation, analysis of the kinetics of mRNA accumulation was necessary to determine whether this increase was transient. Consequently, HepG2 human hepatoma cells were incubated in histidine-free MEM for 0–24 h, and the mRNA level for ATF3 was measured by qPCR (Fig. 1A). An initial increase in ATF3 mRNA content was observed after 2 h of histidine limitation and then reached a maximum of about 15 times the control value at 8 h. Although there was a trend of decline from 8 to 24 h, the level was still elevated by 10 times the control after 24 h. To evaluate whether mRNA stabilization contributes to the increase in ATF3 mRNA in HepG2 cells, they were first incubated in MEM without histidine for 12 h to elevate ATF3 mRNA content, and then transferred to either fresh histidine-free MEM or complete MEM, both containing 5 μm ActD (Fig. 1B). ATF3 RNA content was assayed by qPCR, and the rate of decay was analyzed graphically. The half-life was increased from about 1 h in control cells, to greater than 8 h in the histidine-deprived state, documenting a role for mRNA stabilization in response to nutrient deprivation. Treatment of HepG2 cells with thapsigargin (300 nm), which induces an ER stress response through inhibition of the ER Ca2+-ATPase, also increased the half-life of ATF3 mRNA from 1 to 3 h (Fig. 1C), but the increase was much less than that by amino acid limitation. Analysis of transcription rate from the ATF3 gene revealed that it was only increased by about 2-fold after amino acid limitation (data not shown). These results indicate that amino acid limitation of HepG2 cells elevates the ATF3 mRNA content mainly by increasing mRNA stability. The 3′-UTR of the ATF3 mRNA Is a Determinant of Stability—Regulation of mRNA stability is often mediated by AU-rich sequences within the 3′-UTR (20Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The possible importance of such sequences within the ATF3 3′-UTR was suggested by sequence analysis of the human, chimp, and rat ATF3 mRNA, which revealed that a stretch of 3′-UTR AU-rich regions existed and was highly conserved among all three species. To test whether or not the ATF3 3′-UTR mediates mRNA stability during amino acid limitation, a luciferase reporter construct was made such that a 418-bp fragment (nt 1463–1880) from the ATF3 3′-UTR was inserted between the luciferase coding sequence and the SV40 polyadenylation region in the pGL3-Promoter plasmid (Fig. 2). The half-life of the luciferase mRNA from the pGL3-Promoter plasmid in cells incubated without histidine was increased slightly (Fig. 2A). The addition of the ATF3 3′-UTR to the luciferase mRNA resulted in an increase in mRNA half-life from 2 h in the amino acid complete MEM condition to 8 h in the histidine-free MEM condition (Fig. 2B). This result demonstrates that the ATF3 3′-UTR is capable of conferring amino acid-regulated stabilization to a heterologous mRNA. Furthermore, the fold increase in the half-life of the heterologous mRNA is similar to the increase observed for the endogenous ATF3 mRNA (Fig. 1), indicating that the 418-bp fragment from the ATF3 3′-UTR contains all the sequences required for the regulation of ATF3 mRNA by stabilization. Effect of Amino Acid Limitation on AUF1 and HuR mRNA and Protein Levels—HepG2 cells were incubated in histidine-free MEM for 0–8 h, and the mRNA level for AUF1 and HuR was measured by qPCR (Fig. 3). Amino acid limitation caused a slightly elevated mRNA level for both HuR and AUF1 mRNA. HuR is a 32-kDa RNA-binding protein predominantly nuclear in localization, but a number of stimuli can cause its translocation to the cytoplasm (30Lal A. Mazan-Mamczarz K. Kawai T. Yang X. Martindale J.L. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3092-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). AUF1 or hnRNP D is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins expressed in four isoforms, p37, 40, 42, or 45, through alternative splicing of a common pre-mRNA (31Wagner B.J. DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To establish the kinetics of AUF1 or HuR protein content and subcellular localization after amino acid limitation, cytoplasmic extracts or nuclear extracts from control (complete MEM) or histidine-deprived (MEM-His) HepG2 cells were subjected to immunoblotting (Fig. 4). Amino acid limitation increased the cytoplasmic content of both HuR and AUF1 (Fig. 4A). For AUF1, the protein was detectable predominantly as the p40/42 isoform. The relative amount of the AUF1 isoforms was more equally distributed in the nucleus, and there was a slight increase in abundance at 4–8 h after histidine deprivation (Fig. 4B).

https://openalex.org/W2090009283,"Analytical ultracentrifugation and fluorescence anisotropy methods have been used to measure the equilibrium parameters that control the formation of the core subcomplex of NusB and NusE proteins and boxA RNA. This subcomplex, in turn, nucleates the assembly of the antitermination complex that is involved in controlling the synthesis of ribosomal RNA in Escherichia coli and that also participates in forming the N protein-dependent antitermination complex in lambdoid phage synthesis. In this study we determined the dissociation constants (Kd values) for the individual binary interactions that participate in the assembly of the ternary NusB-NusE-boxA RNA subassembly, and we showed that multiple equilibria, involving both specific and nonspecific binding, are involved in the assembly pathway of this protein-RNA complex. The measured Kd values were used to model the in vitro assembly reaction and combined with in vivo concentration data to simulate the overall control of the assembly of this complex in E. coli at two different cellular growth rates. The results showed that at both growth rates assembly proceeds via the initial formation of a weak but specific NusB-boxA complex, which is then stabilized by NusE binding. We showed that NusE also binds nonspecifically to available single-stranded RNA sequences and that such nonspecific protein binding to RNA can help to regulate crucial interactions in the assembly of the various macromolecular machines of gene expression.

We showed that NusE also binds nonspecifically to available single-stranded RNA sequences and that such nonspecific protein binding to RNA can help to regulate crucial interactions in the assembly of the various macromolecular machines of gene expression. Macromolecular machines involving multiple protein and nucleic acid components drive and regulate many important cellular processes. These include gene expression, protein synthesis and trafficking, as well as signal transduction and many other processes. The assembly of the relevant macromolecular complexes is often controlled by additional regulatory factors that modulate the effective binding affinity of the central components of a self-assembling macromolecular machine. Another regulatory strategy involves controlling the local concentration of a critical component of the complex, which can perturb crucial binding interactions by manipulating mass action effects. In principle this strategy uses changes in the concentration parameter as a “switch” to turn the targeted assembly reaction on or off; a good example of this strategy involves using the control of the synthesis (and thus of the free concentration) of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein of T4 (gp32) to regulate the assembly of the functional T4 DNA replication complex (1von Hippel P.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. Paul L.S. Stormo G.D. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 795-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, if this component is “tethered” in the vicinity of the assembly to be regulated (e.g. by cis-RNA looping (2Whalen W.A. Das A. New Biol. 1990; 2: 975-991PubMed Google Scholar, 3Van Gilst M.R. Rees W.A. Das A. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1514-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)), this switch can be used to confine the regulation of concentration change only to nearby target loci on the genome and not to others.Characterizing the binding interactions between particular components of a macromolecular complex and elucidating the mechanisms of assembly is a challenging, but vital, part of understanding how cellular processes are regulated. This problem is compounded when RNA is one of the binding partners, because the same RNA molecule can assume different conformations, and proteins that interact with RNA can bind specifically to one particular sequence or conformation and may also bind nonspecifically to other sequences or conformations. RNA-protein complex assembly often begins with one or more binding events that nucleate complex formation by either increasing or decreasing the affinity of other factors for elements of the complex, thus regulating the various competing reaction pathways that function in processes such as RNA transcription, RNA processing, or protein synthesis.One such regulatory RNA-protein subassembly is the “core” boxA complex that is involved in antitermination control of the transcription of ribosomal RNA genes (rrn) in bacteria (4Nodwell J.R. Greenblatt J. Cell. 1993; 72: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 5Sharrock R.A. Gourse R.L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5275-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). RNA transcription can be regulated by specific signal sequences in the DNA, in the nascent RNA, and by protein factors that interact with the RNA polymerase complex. Once initiated, RNA transcription may also be suspended by pause, backtracking, or arrest signals (see Refs. 6Weisberg R.A. Gottesman M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 359-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 7Greive S.J. von Hippel P.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Termination occurs (generally at pause sites) when the elongation complex dissociates; the RNA transcript is released, and the RNA polymerase is recycled to initiate another round of transcription. In bacteria, the elements that regulate reaction pathways in transcription often involve signals in the nascent RNA and may control the efficiency of either Rho-dependent or intrinsic terminators or both.The hexameric Rho helicase binds to cytosine-rich sequences and, driven by ATP hydrolysis, translocates 5′ → 3′ along the nascent RNA strand to “catch up with” elongation complexes that have been slowed by pause signals. Rho then uses its RNA-DNA helicase activity to remove the RNA from the complex, causing the polymerase also to release the template DNA and thus to terminate transcription (reviewed in Ref. 8Richardson J.P. Cell. 2003; 114: 157-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Intrinsic terminators are characterized by a stable terminator hairpin stem-loop structure that forms in the nascent RNA immediately adjacent to the polymerase. This hairpin is followed by a run of uridine residues that, with their complementary deoxyadenine partners, form a particularly weak RNA-DNA hybrid at the terminator. These RNA sequence elements work together to destabilize the elongation complex and bring about transcription termination (9Wilson K.S. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8793-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 10Rees W. Weitzel S. Das A. von Hippel P. J. Mol.

Cell. 2002; 10: 1151-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition transcript release at these terminators competes with further elongation, is regulated by antitermination factors that involve signals in the RNA that loop back and bind to the RNA polymerase, either directly or through protein co-factors, and modulates the efficiency of vicinal terminators. How this modulation of termination is brought about has been the subject of numerous studies (12Van Gilst M.R. von Hippel P.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 323: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 13Condon C. Squires C. Squires C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 623-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Antitermination of Rho-mediated termination of rrn genes is mediated by boxA, which comprises a specific sequence of 11 nucleotide residues located in the leader region of the 16 S RNA and in the spacer region between the 16 S and the 23 S RNA genes on the template (14Berg K.L. Squires C. Squires C.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Heinrich T. Condon C. Pfeiffer T. Hartmann R.K. J.

The boxA sequence is also required for long range N-mediated antitermination during the lytic growth of lambdoid phages (17DeVito J. Das A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8660-8664Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a heterodimer of protein co-factors NusB and NusE (ribosomal protein S10; see Fig. 1A) binds to boxA RNA, along with NusA, NusG, and ribosomal proteins (S4, S2, L4, and L13) in controlling rrn transcription, and with N and boxB RNA in regulating lambdoid phage development (Fig. 1B). These complexes then interact with RNA polymerase to greatly reduce the local efficiency of transcript termination (4Nodwell J.R. Greenblatt J. Cell. 1993; 72: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Nodwell J.R. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2141-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 19Van Gilst M. von Hippel P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 160-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Torres M. Condon C. Balada J.M. Squires C. Squires C.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3811-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Binding of NusB and NusE to boxA RNA has been considered to be a central nucleation event for the assembly of the antitermination core complex, because this interaction is needed to permit the assembly of the other components of both the rrn and the phage λ antitermination systems (21Mason S.W. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Mogridge J. Mah T.F. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4143-4148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study we characterize the interaction of NusB and NusE with boxA RNA, and we explore the mechanism of assembly of this initial (core) antitermination complex.Earlier studies (4Nodwell J.R.

Biol. 2002; 316: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) of this assembly reaction, carried out using gel shift and surface plasmon resonance assays, have been interpreted in terms of a sequential two-step assembly mechanism for the formation of the NusB-NusE-boxA RNA complex (Fig. 1A). In these studies it was assumed that a NusB-NusE heterodimer forms first, and this heterodimer then binds to the rrn boxA RNA sequence. Based on this model and these data, an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd)of ∼0.1 to 1 μm was estimated for the binding of the protein heterodimer to the boxA RNA sequence. No binding of these proteins to λ nutR boxA RNA was observed in the gel shift experiments (4Nodwell J.R. Greenblatt J. Cell. 1993; 72: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).In this study we have used sensitive fluorescence anisotropy and analytical ultracentrifugation methods to characterize the interaction of NusB and NusE with the rrn and λ boxA RNAs, as well as to monitor the two-component assembly of the protein heterodimer itself. Our results show that this assembly process is more subtle than previously appreciated, involving competing sets of binary interactions of the components that are characterized by similar dissociation constants. We have shown that the direct binding of NusE to boxA is nonspecific but results in the stabilization of the specific binding of NusB to this RNA. These findings provide a more detailed view of the assembly pathway that leads to the formation of the boxA-containing core antitermination complex and (as considered under the “Discussion”) provide insights into how this pathway might be controlled to regulate antitermination in vivo in both the transcription of the rrn genes and in the lytic phase of phage λ synthesis in E. coli.MATERIALS AND METHODSBuffers and Reagents—All fluorescence anisotropy titrations and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses were conducted in buffer A (25 mm Hepes, 100 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.5), unless otherwise stated. DNA oligonucleotides used for PCR were synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA), and RNA oligonucleotides used in fluorescence anisotropy and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were ordered from Dharmacon (Lafayette CO; TABLE ONE), de-protected according to the manufacturer's instructions, and purified by urea 20% PAGE, followed by further purification over a C18 SepPak column (Waters). RNA concentrations were determined using UV absorbance measurements at 260 nm. NusB and NusE were purified as described below, and protein concentrations were determined via absorbance at 280 nm, on molar extinction coefficients of 14,650 and 1,280 cm-1 based m-1, respectively (25Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5023) Google Scholar). The concentrations of NusB and NusE used in this study are within 10% of the stated values. Prior to use, RNA and proteins were diluted or dialyzed into buffer A, as stated below. Tobacco etch virus (TEV) 3The abbreviations used are:TEVtobacco etch virusMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight protease used in the purification of NusB (below) was expressed and purified according the method of Lucast and co-workers (26Lucast L.J.

The fragment coding for NusE was inserted into pET11a (Promega, Madison, WI) at BamHI and HindIII restriction sites, whereas the NusB fragment was inserted (at BamHI and XhoI restriction sites) into the pBH expression vector (a kind gift from the Prehoda Lab, Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon), which codes for an N-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by a TEV protease site. Plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells, and protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h when cell growth had reached an A600 of 0.5. Cells containing expressed protein were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min in an F6B Sorvall rotor in a Beckman J-6M centrifuge. The resulting cell pellets were stored at -80 °C.The cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm potassium acetate) containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm dithiothreitol (for NusE) and lysed by three passes through a French press at 1000 p.s.i. The resulting lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to remove cell debris, and the supernatants were processed as described below. Lysates containing NusE protein were precipitated overnight at 4 °C with an equal volume of 40% ammonium sulfate in buffer A (20% final concentration) added dropwise while stirring. The precipitated protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, washed twice with buffer A, and dissolved in buffer B (6 m urea, 25 mm Hepes, 50 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.5). The protein was purified over a cation exchange column (MonoS; Bio-Rad), washed with 2 column volumes of buffer B, and eluted in 3-ml fractions with a 50-300 mm potassium acetate gradient in buffer B. Fractions containing NusE were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, dialyzed against buffer B, and passed over a second MonoS column as described above. Fractions containing purified NusE from the second column were pooled and dialyzed against a 6-0 m urea gradient in buffer A over 24 h, after which precipitated NusE was removed by centrifugation and aliquots of the NusE protein snap-frozen and stored at -80 °C.NusB lysates were passed over a Talon resin column (BD Biosciences), washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A, followed by 10 column volumes of buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole, and eluted with a 20-250 mm imidazole gradient. Fractions containing NusB were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis, pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and digested with TEV protease overnight at 16 °C, followed by dialysis against buffer A. The NusB protein was passed over another Talon column to remove uncleaved protein and the protease, dialyzed against buffer A. Aliquots were then snap-frozen and stored at -80 °C.Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments were carried out in a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge, and the data were subjected to van Holde-Weischet analysis using Ultrascan (B. Demeler, the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio (27Demeler B. van Holde K.E. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 335: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)), Sedfit, and Sedphat (P. Schuck, National Institutes of Health (28Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar, 29Dam J. Schuck P. Biophys.

Lary, National Ultracentrifuge Facility) for equilibrium runs. Fits using Sedfit and Sedphat were considered satisfactory if the root mean square deviation was less than 0.007, and the residuals were completely random and represented less than 10% of the signal.The individual proteins, NusB (4.5 μm) and NusE (∼20 μm; maximum concentration in phosphate buffer), and their various complexes with one another and with boxA RNA, including NusB-NusE (∼5 μm each), NusB-boxA (9 and 2 μm, respectively), and NusB-NusE-boxA (5.4, 6, and 2 μm, respectively), were analyzed by sedimentation velocity methods. Samples were equilibrated by microdialysis with a 5000 molecular weight cut-off membrane with buffer A or buffer C (25 mm potassium phosphate, 200 mm potassium acetate, pH 7) for NusE alone and were inserted into the sample chamber of a two-channel ultracentrifuge cell (buffer A, or buffer C for NusE alone, was inserted into the buffer chamber) using quartz windows and an aluminum centerpiece. Cells were placed in an An60 titanium rotor and centrifuged at 60,000 rpm for 5 h at 20 °C and were scanned continuously using absorbance at 229 and 280 nm for proteins, and 260 nm for RNA. For sedimentation equilibrium analysis, NusB (4.5 μm) in buffer A and buffer A were placed in the sample and buffer chambers, respectively, of a 6-well equilibrium centerpiece, and the cell was assembled with quartz windows. Three scans at 280 nm in an An60 Ti rotor were conducted after equilibrium was reached at each of the following speeds: 10,000, 15,000, 27,000, 31,000, and 40,000 rpm at 20 °C. Data collected at 31,000 rpm were analyzed with the Winnl06 program, assuming a single globular species to determine σ values that were then used to calculate molecular weights.Mass Spectroscopy—The NusB and NusE proteins were also examined by mass spectroscopy (Matthews Laboratory, Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon), using a Voyager Biospectrometry MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Proteins were prepared for analysis in a matrix of sinapinic acid (Sigma), and NusE was desalted before analysis with a ZipTip C18 column (Millipore, Billerica, MA).Fluorescence Anisotropy—RNA sequences for rrn boxA, λ nutR boxA, and reverse rrn boxA (TABLE ONE), 5′-labeled with 5-carboxy fluorescein, were used for fluorescence anisotropy experiments in buffer A unless otherwise specified. Unlabeled rrn boxA RNA was used in the competition experiments. Proteins (in buffer A) were titrated into a 0.5-cm quartz cuvette (Starna, Atascadero, CA) containing fluorescent RNA and, where indicated, protein as well, and the fluorescence anisotropy at each point was determined at 25 °C using an L-format Jobin-Yvon Horiba Fluoromax fluorimeter.Data Fitting and Simulation—Anisotropy data were fit to a two-component binding equation (Equation 1) to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) by using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and error analysis in the program Profit (Quantumsoft, Uetikon am See, Switzerland) and the following fitting Equation 1, A=Ao+(A−Ao)×±(−Kd+[Po]+[RNAo]√((Kd−[Po],−[RNAo])2−4[Po][RNAo])2[Po](Eq. 1) where A is the anisotropy; Ao is the initial anisotropy, and Po and RNAo are the total protein and RNA concentrations, respectively. Complex equilibria in multiple data sets were fit by global analysis using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in the Dynafit program (Biokin, Pullman, WA (31Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar)), based on the following dissociation constants and equilibrium relationships as shown in (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3), (Eq. 4), (Eq. 5), (Eq. 6), (Eq. 7), BE↔B+E:K1=[B][E]/[BE](Eq. 2) BER↔BE+R:K2=[BE][R]/[BER](Eq. 3) BR↔B+R:K5=[B][R]/[BR](Eq. 4) BER↔BR+E:K6=[BR][E]/[BER](Eq. 5) BER↔B+E+R:Kber=[B][E][R]/[BER](Eq. 6) (ER)n↔E+R:Kn=[E][R]/[(ER)n](Eq. 7) where B represents NusB; E represents NusE; (ER)n represents the non-specific binary complex of E and RNA, and R represents the RNA oligomer involved. A range of initial values for each parameter, including those determined experimentally, was used in multiple rounds of fitting to ensure that the final values calculated for K2 and Kber represented the best fit and confidence intervals. The information gained from the global fits were used to simulate boxA assembly kinetics under various conditions using the Berkeley Madonna program (R. Macey and G. Oster, University of California, Berkeley), and data from both analyses of the complex equilibria were plotted using the Profit program.RESULTSAssociation States of NusB and NusE—N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged E. coli NusB protein was purified by chromatography using TALON resin, and the His tag was removed by cleavage with TEV protease (see “Materials and Methods”). This protease leaves two “extra” N-terminal residues (serine and glycine) on purified NusB protein, increasing the predicted molecular mass slightly from 15.67 to 15.8 kDa. However, the function of this protein, which is required (along with NusE and the other components of the λ and rrn antitermination complexes) to increase the transcription rate from long templates (data not shown) and λ N-mediated antitermination activity in vitro, 4C. Conant, unpublished data. was not changed by this modification.Sedimentation velocity experiments with purified NusB protein, using the van Holde-Weischet analysis, revealed that the protein exists as a monomer in solution and is characterized by a corrected sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) of 1.7 S and a relatively spherical shape (Fig. 2A, note the absence of nonideality in these data). Analysis with the Sedfit program also yielded an s20,w value of 1.7 S and an estimated molecular mass of 16 kDa, as well as a frictional ratio of 1.35, indicative of a globular shape (Fig. 2, B and C). The monomer molecular mass of NusB was confirmed by sedimentation equilibrium runs at 31,000 rpm, using absorbance optics at 280 nm. Winnonlin software was used to analyze the equilibrium data. Assuming a single globular species yielded a σ factor of 2.179 for NusB, corresponding to a molecular mass of 16.2 kDa (Fig. 2D). This value was also confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (data not shown) and is consistent with previous studies and with a monomer of 15.8 kDa based on the amino acid residue sequence (24Luttgen H.

A, van Holde-Weischet analysis of sedimentation velocity data at 280 nm and 60,000 rpm yields a sedimentation coefficient (s20,w value) of 1.7 S and shows that the NusB protein sediments as a globular monomer species. B and C, further analysis of these data with Sedfit (28Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar) also yields a plot of c(s) versus s20,w and shows that the main component in this sedimentation profile sediments with an s20,w of 1.7 S, which is equivalent to a molecular mass of 16 kDa for a (assumed globular) NusB monomer in a c(M) versus s20,w plot. D, a sedimentation equilibrium plot of NusB protein concentration versus radial position (R) in the ultracentrifuge cell. Sedimentation was at 31,000 rpm, and the data (circles) from scans at 280 nm were fit to a single species model using the Winnonlin program. A σ value of 2.18 and a mass of 16.2 kDa were obtained.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)E. coli NusE was purified as described above. Despite previous reports that this protein is insoluble in its native form (24Luttgen H. Robelek R. Muhlberger R. Diercks T. Schuster S.C. Kohler P. Kessler H. Bacher A. Richter G. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 33Culver G.M. Noller H.F. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 832-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we note that concentrations of NusE up to a concentration of ∼20 μm could be obtained by slow dialysis through a urea gradient (from 6 m to native buffer). Previous data from proteolytic digests and chemical degradation experiments had suggested that free E. coli NusE might exist in a relatively unstructured form (34Yaguchi M. Roy C. Wittmann H.G. FEBS Lett. 1980; 121: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and because NusE from Mycobacterium tuberculosis has also been shown (by CD spectroscopy and NMR) to be relatively unstructured (even when bound to NusB (35Gopal B. Papavinasasundaram K.G. Dodson G. Colston M.J. Major S.A. Lane A.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 920-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)), it seems likely that E. coli NusE is also largely unstructured. It also seems likely that NusE functions within the core complex in a manner similar to that of λ N protein in the N-dependent antitermination system. N has also been shown to be largely unstructured in free solution and to assume a partially helical structure (in its N-terminal domain) on binding to its specific (boxB) RNA target. N also binds to its various other reaction partners (including NusA and RNA polymerase) in a modular fashion, using its other (initially unstructured) sequence domains (36Greenblatt J. Li J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 37Van Gilst M. Rees W.A. von Hippel P.H. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1995; 33: 145-147Google Scholar).The sedimentation properties of free NusE in phosphate buffer (see “Materials and Methods”) were determined from sedimentation velocity experiments analyzed with Sedfit. The data were noisy, due both to the strong tendency of the free protein to aggregate and to its paucity of aromatic amino acid residues and small size. However, despite these limitations, the data collected at 229 nm could be reasonably well fit (with a root mean square deviation of 0.03 and residual values somewhat greater than 10% of the signal to obtain an s20,w of 0.5 S (Fig. 3A) and a frictional ratio of 2.6 (consistent with a largely random coil structure)). A molecular mass of 10.5 kDa (Fig. 3B) was estimated from these data, consistent with the existence of this protein as a monomer in free solution. This estimated molecular mass was confirmed by mass spectrometry, which yielded a mass of 11.8 kDa for the NusE protein (data not shown), consistent with expectations from"
https://openalex.org/W2090052767,"Transcriptional regulation by transforming growth factor-β signaling is mediated by the Smad family of transcription factors. It is generally accepted that Smads must interact with other transcription factors to bind to their targets. However, recently it has been shown that a complex of the Drosophila Smad proteins, Mad and Medea, binds with high affinity to silencer elements that repress brinker and bag of marbles in response to Dpp signaling. Here we report that these silencers are bound by a heterotrimer containing two Mad subunits and one Medea subunit. We found that the MH1 domains of all three subunits contributed directly to sequence-specific DNA contact, thus accounting for the exceptionally high stability of the Smad-silencer complex. The Medea MH1 domain binds to a canonical Smad box (GTCT), whereas the Mad MH1 domains bind to a GC-rich sequence resembling Mad binding sites previously identified in Dpp-responsive enhancer elements. The consensus for this sequence, GRCGNC, differs from that of the canonical Smad box, but we found that Mad binding nonetheless required the same β-hairpin amino acids that mediate base-specific contact with GTCT. Binding was also affected by alanine substitutions in Mad and Med at a subset of basic residues within and flanking helix 2, indicating a contribution to binding of the GRCGNC and GTCT sites. The slight alteration of the Dpp silencers caused them to activate transcription in response to Dpp signaling, indicating that the potential for Smad complexes to recognize specific targets need not be limited to repression.

Transforming growth factor-β signaling pathways activate or repress transcription by means of cooperative action of Smad proteins with a large number of interacting cofactors (1Shi Y. Massague J.

Upon activation by signaling, Smads form complexes such that more than one MH1 domain is available to contact DNA (5Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. Ten D.P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M.

With a major portion of target recognition provided by interacting cofactors, DNA contact by a single MH1 domain can be sufficient for regulation in response to signaling (7Chen X. Weisberg E.

In contrast, Smad complexes bind to several Drosophila silencer elements without the assistance of a cofactor (11Muller B. Hartmann B. Pyrowolakis G. Affolter M. Basler K.

These silencers repress the brinker (brk), bag of marbles (bam), and gooseberry (gsb) genes in response to signaling by decapentaplegic (dpp). Repression of brk plays a central role in the dpp pathway (13Affolter M. Marty T. Vigano M.A. Jazwinska A. EMBO Journal. 2001; 20: 3298-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Raftery L.A.

Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 701-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); in addition to direct activation by Smads, Dpp targets are regulated indirectly through repression by the Brk protein (15Minami M.

Mad is homologous to the BMP 2The abbreviations used are:BMPbone morphogenetic proteinMHMad homologyeGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutinin -specific Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 receptor-activated Smads (rSmads). Med is the homolog of Smad4, the coSmad that forms complexes with rSmads. Genetic and biochemical analyses confirmed that Mad and Medea are both required for repression of brk (11Muller B.

Repression of brk also requires the large zinc finger protein Schnurri (Shn) (11Muller B. Hartmann B. Pyrowolakis G. Affolter M. Basler K.

Although Shn contains three zinc finger clusters, alone it does not bind to the silencer, and repression requires only a carboxyl-terminal region containing three zinc fingers that confer interaction with the silencer-bound Mad-Med complex (11Muller B.

One means of achieving this would be for a greater number of MH1 domains to interact with DNA in a sequence-specific manner. The number of MH1 domains contained within a Smad complex is determined by the way in which Smad MH2 domains oligomerize (26Zhang Y. Feng X. Wu R. Derynck R.

However, work from several groups has provided evidence that Smads also form other types of complexes, including heterodimers (35Jayaraman L. Massague J. J. Biol.

Here we report that Mad and Med bind to the brk and bam silencers through all three MH1 domains of a Mad-Med heterotrimer. The results reveal a mechanism by which Smad complexes bind certain regulatory elements with high affinity and specificity. The arrangement of these sites is critical for silencing, and minor alterations can result in Dpp-responsive transcriptional activation instead of repression. Plasmids—Mad, Med, and TkvQD effector plasmids for expression in human 293T cells were generated by insertion of full-length cDNAs into the polylinker of a version of the pCI expression vector that had been modified to contain an amino-terminal FLAG, HA, or Myc tag; ShnCT was cloned into epitope tag versions of pCI as a PCR fragment encoding Ser-1884 through Asn-2527. 1XGFPMed was generated by ligating into the XbaI site of pCI an NheI-XbaI fragment from pEGFP-Med (provided by Y. Cai) containing the fused eGFP and Med coding regions. A second copy of eGFP was inserted as a XmaI-BspEI fragment into the BspE1 site of 1XGFPMed to give 2XGFPMed. Substitution of an XbaI-NotI fragment encoding Mad in place of the Med coding region yielded 1XGFPMad and 2XGFPMad. Site-directed mutagenesis of Mad and Med effector plasmids was carried out using a previously described method (38Sawano A. Miyawaki A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: e78Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Plasmid constructs and products of site-directed mutagenesis were verified by DNA sequencing. For reporter assays, the BrkS sequence GACTGGCGACATTCTGTCTGGTGGCGATCGC was inserted between the EcoRI and NotI sites of 3xSu(H)-HSC, which was generated by insertion of the sequence GTTCTCACGGAACCAAAGGTTCTCACGGAACCAAAGGTTCTCAC between the NotI and KpnI sites of hsplacCaSpeR (39Nelson H.B. Laughon A. Roux's Arch Dev. Biol. 1993; 202: 341-354Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). pPacTkvQD, pPacSu(H), and pPacNAct have been described previously (40Kirkpatrick H. Johnson K. Laughon A. J.

Gel Shift Assay—Whole cell lysates for use in gel shift assays were prepared from human 293T cells that had been transfected in 10-cm dishes with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the supplier's protocol. The per plate amounts of pCI effector plasmids expressing Mad, Med, and TkvQD were 2, 2, and 1 μg, respectively. Twenty-four hours after transfection, 293T cells were harvested and lysed in 400 μl of ice-cold DNAP buffer (80 mm NaCl, 35 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet-P40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm NaF, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a microfuge at 4 °C and stored frozen at –80 °C. DNA probes were made by [α-32P]dATP fill-in labeling of annealed oligonucleotides, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and spin column gel filtration. For each gel shift DNA-binding reaction, 9 μl of cell lysate was mixed with 1 μl of DNA probe diluted to 10–9m with 1 mg/ml dIdC. Reactions were incubated 30 min on ice, then 2 μl was loaded per well onto a 60 × 80 × 1.5 mm 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE buffer. Gels were run with 4 °C cooling at 100 V for 40–70 min (run time adjusted according to probe length). Gels were dried and then imaged with a Storm PhosphorImager. Reporter Assay—Drosophila S2 cells were grown at 25 °C in M3 medium supplemented with 12.5% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected in 24-well non-coated plates using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the supplier's protocol. Cells were harvested 2 days after transfection, and a chemiluminescent β-galactosidase assay was performed on cell extracts using the GalactoStar assay system (Tropix, Inc.) according to the supplier's instructions. All reporter experiments were performed in triplicate. Dpp Silencers Are Bound by a Heterotrimer Containing Mad and Med in a 2:1 Ratio—The BrkS and BamSE silencers are the only examples in which Smad proteins appear to be solely responsible for target recognition (11Muller B.

The silencer consensus sequence was derived from sequence alignment and from determining the effects of base substitutions (12Pyrowolakis G. Hartmann B. Muller B. Basler K. Affolter M. Dev.

The left side of the consensus, GRCGNC, resembles the Mad binding consensus, GCCGnCG (41Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), whereas the right side, GTCT, matches the Smad3/Smad4 consensus for binding of a single MH1 domain (4Zawel L. Dai J.L.

Haijuan Y. Massague J. Pavletich N. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Gel shift experiments with purified Mad and Med fusion proteins showed that Mad binds with similar affinity to either site, whereas Med has high affinity only for the GTCT (Fig. 1B) (12Pyrowolakis G. Hartmann B. Muller B. Basler K. Affolter M. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Chen D.H. McKearin D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1786-1791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This suggests a simple model in which Mad and Med bind to the left and right side of the silencer, respectively. Gel shift experiments with lysates of transfected cells show that Mad and Med bind the silencers as a complex, with antibody supershifts confirming the presence of both proteins in the complex (Fig. 1C) (11Muller B. Hartmann B. Pyrowolakis G. Affolter M. Basler K. Cell. 2003; 113: 221-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 12Pyrowolakis G. Hartmann B. Muller B. Basler K. Affolter M. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The binding of the Mad-Med complex allows Shn to be recruited via a carboxyl-terminal region (ShnCT, Fig. 1C) (11Muller B. Hartmann B. Pyrowolakis G. Affolter M. Basler K. Cell. 2003; 113: 221-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 12Pyrowolakis G. Hartmann B. Muller B. Basler K. Affolter M. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We noticed that when supershifting a complex in which Mad was epitope-tagged, a faint second supershifted band was sometimes visible (Fig. 1D), which is an indication that some complexes may contain two Mad subunits. To investigate the stoichiometry of silencer-bound Mad-Med complexes, we fused one or two copies of eGFP to the amino-terminal ends of FLAG-tagged Mad and of FLAG-tagged Med. eGFP was deemed suitable for this approach (43Hope I.A. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2781-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) because it is effectively monomeric (44Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11984-11989Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 45Vogel M. Vorreiter J. Nassal M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Bioinformatics. 2005; 58: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The resulting 1× and 2× GFP fusions to Mad and Med bound to BamSE and BrkS probes in gel shift assays with about the same affinity as their normal counterparts but with slower mobility that was easily distinguishable from the wild-type Mad-Med-silencer complex (Fig. 2A). This allowed us to test whether each Smad existed in one or two copies within the DNA-bound complex. For example, if only one Mad exists in the complex, coexpression of Mad and 2xGFPMad (together with Med and TkvQD) should give two bands, the normal Mad-Med complex and the slower mobility 2xGFPMad-Med complex. If the complex contains two Mad subunits, there should be three bands, Mad-Mad-Med, Mad-2xGFPMad-Med, and 2xGFPMad-2xGFPMad-Med. Using a BamSE probe, the combination of Mad, 2xGFPMad, and Med resulted in three bands (Fig. 2A), of which the intermediate band was the strongest in intensity, as expected because Mad-2xGFPMad-Med complexes should be twice as abundant as complexes containing only one Mad isoform. Furthermore, the intermediate band had the same mobility observed for a 1xGFP-Mad + Med complex, consistent with a mobility shift caused by the presence of two copies of eGFP. The same result was obtained using a BrkS probe (Fig. 2B), and thus we conclude the Mad-Med-silencer complex contains two Mad subunits. In contrast, we found that lysates containing Mad, Med and 2xGFPMed formed only two bands (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that the Mad-Med-silencer complex contains only a single Med subunit. Mad Contacts GRCGNC by Means of the β-Hairpin—The DNA-binding interface of Smad3 is a β-hairpin structure (42Shi Y. Wang Y. Jayaraman L. L. H.Y. Haijuan Y. Massague J. Pavletich N. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) that is completely conserved in all rSmads, with only two amino acid differences in coSmads. This conservation of the DNA-binding interface suggests that all Smads might bind DNA with the same sequence specificity. However, the GC-rich binding sites first described for Mad and later for Smad1 appear to be distinct from the canonical Smad3 GTCT site, and it has been proposed that such sites are bound through sequence-nonspecific contact with the lysine-rich helix 2, which lies adjacent to the β-hairpin (46Shi Y.G. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 47Chai J.J. Wu J.W. Yan N. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Shi Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20327-20331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Single base pair substitutions in the GRCGNC sites of BrkS and BamSE diminish binding of the Mad-Med complex and repression (12Pyrowolakis G. Hartmann B. Muller B. Basler K. Affolter M. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (data not shown), evidence that binding of the Mad-Med complex to GRCGNC sites is sequence-specific. To investigate the basis for this sequence specificity, we introduced alanine substitutions at three positions within the Mad β-hairpin, Arg-88, Gln-90, and Lys-95, each of which corresponds to a Smad3 residue whose side chain makes direct base-specific contact in the Smad3-DNA structure (Fig. 3A) (42Shi Y. Wang Y. Jayaraman L. L. H.Y. Haijuan Y. Massague J. Pavletich N. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Western blots showed that these mutations and all others described below had little or no effect on the level of Mad or Med in whole cell lysates (Fig. 3B, bottom). Nonetheless, all three mutations strongly reduced complex formation with BrkS (Fig. 3B) or BamSE (data not shown). As expected, alanine substitutions at the corresponding positions in Med had a similar effect (Fig. 3B). We also tested an alanine substitution for Mad His-93, which corresponds to His-79 in Smad3, a residue that makes indirect base contact through water molecules (47Chai J.J. Wu J.W. Yan N. Massague J.

These results demonstrate that the β-hairpin of Mad is necessary for contact of GRCGNC sites, just as it is for GTCT contact by Med. Helix 2 Contributes to DNA Binding—Although our results indicated that binding of Mad to the GRCGNC occurs via the β-hairpin, we went on to test whether residues within or adjacent to helix 2 might nevertheless contribute to binding. The lysine-rich stretch of helix 2 has been shown to function as a nuclear localization signal (48Xiao Z. Liu X.D. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7853-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 49Xiao Z. Watson N. Rodriguez C. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39404-39410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) but a series of helix 2 lysine to alanine mutations resulted in little or no change in Mad or Med levels in whole cell lysates of transfected 293T cells, as determined from Western blots (Fig. 3B). Comparing these lysates in gel shift experiments, we found that Mad-Med-BrkS complex formation was strongly disrupted by Mad R58A, a residue that is just carboxyl-terminal to helix 2, with moderate effects caused with Mad K46A and by Med R66A, K74A and D80A (Fig. 3B). The results show that helix 2 and carboxyl-terminally adjacent residues contribute to the DNA binding activity of Med as well as that of Mad, suggesting that helix 2-backbone contact may be a general feature of Smad-DNA interaction and not exclusive to interaction with the GRCGNC site. Together, these results suggest that Mad and Med both contact DNA via the β-hairpin in a configuration that is similar to that of the Smad3 MH1 domain bound to GTCT, possibly with helix 2 tilted somewhat closer to the DNA backbone. Notably, alanine substitutions in helix 2 of Mad and Med had no obvious effect on recruitment of ShnCT (Fig. 3C). Because binding of ShnCT requires precise 5-bp spacing between GRCGNC and GTCT (discussed below), the MH1 domains are likely sites for Shn interaction. These results indicate that any MH1 contact with ShnCT does not depend critically on solvent-exposed helix 2 side chains. The stretch of basic amino acids that starts in helix 2 extends further in Mad than in Smad3, and we found that one of these additional residues, Arg-58, is required to form the silencer complex. However, from comparison with the Smad3MH1-DNA crystal structure, it is doubtful that Arg-58 would be able to contact the DNA backbone from its position at the end of helix 2. Indeed, the R58A substitution had little effect on binding of purified maltose-binding protein-MadNL (which binds as a monomer) to probes containing GTCT or GGCGAC, whereas R88A dramatically reduced binding to both probes (data not shown), evidence that Arg-58 is not directly involved in DNA contact. Rather than directly contacting DNA, Arg-58 may engage in protein-protein interactions that stabilize the DNA-bound Mad-Med heterotrimer. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that, when bound as a heterotrimer, the Mad MH1 domain adopts a structure in which Arg-58 contacts the DNA backbone. The β-Hairpin Is Required in Both Mad Subunits—The results described above prove only that the β-hairpin is required in at least one of the two Mad subunits contained within the heterotrimer. To test whether the β-hairpin is required in both Mad subunits, we coexpressed Mad R88A, Q90A and K95A mutant proteins with wild-type 2xGFP-Mad and performed a gel shift with a BrkS probe. If β-hairpin contact was required in only one of the two Mad MH1 domains, we expected to observe an intermediate band containing 2xGFPMad and MadR88A (or Q90A/K95A). Faint intermediate bands were observed (Fig. 4), but even the strongest of these, Q90A, was much weaker than for wild-type. We interpret these results as a demonstration that an intact β-hairpin is required in both Mad subunits, although presence in just one subunit does allow for some residual binding. Interestingly, Arg-58 was also required in both Mad subunits. A Mad-Med Heterotrimer Can Activate Transcription—The significance of the GRCGNC(N)5GTCT topology was investigated with a series of rearrangements (Fig. 5A). Reversal of the GTCT in BrkS (mut1 in Fig. 5A) reduced binding of the Mad-Med-silencer complex formation (Fig. 5B) and essentially eliminated repression (Fig. 5C). In contrast, changing GTCT to GGCG (mut2 in Fig. 5A) had only a modest effect on Mad-Med binding but prevented recruitment of Shn (Fig. 5B), transforming the silencer into a Dpp-responsive activating element (Fig. 5C). Similarly, a 1-bp increase (data not shown) or decrease (mut3 in Fig. 5A) in spacing converted the silencer into an activating element (Fig. 5C), again disrupting Shn binding without severely affecting the binding of Mad and Med (Fig. 5B). In the latter two cases, Mad and Med still bound to the DNA as a heterotrimer with a 2:1 ratio (Fig. 5D). Similar results were obtained with the same alterations of BamSE. These results demons"

https://openalex.org/W2043226961,"A critical aspect of tumor progression is the generation of survival signals that overcome default apoptotic programs. Recent studies have revealed that elevated phospholipase D activity generates survival signals in breast and perhaps other human cancers. We report here that the elevated phospholipase D activity in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 suppresses the activity of the putative tumor suppressor protein phosphatase 2A in a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent manner. Increasing the phospholipase D activity in MCF7 cells also suppressed protein phosphatase 2A activity. Elevated phospholipase D activity suppressed association of protein phosphatase 2A with both ribosomal subunit S6-kinase and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1. Suppression of protein phosphatase 2A by SV40 small t-antigen has been reported to be critical for the transformation of human cells with SV40 early region genes. Consistent with a critical role for protein phosphatase 2A in phospholipase D survival signals, either SV40 small t-antigen or pharmacological suppression of protein phosphatase 2A restored survival signals lost by the suppression of either phospholipase D or mTOR. Blocking phospholipase D signals also led to reduced phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD at the protein phosphatase 2A dephosphorylation site at Ser-112. The ability of phospholipase D to suppress protein phosphatase 2A identifies a critical target of an emerging phospholipase D/mTOR survival pathway in the transformation of human cells."

By using a yeast two-hybrid screening system, we identified a transmembrane protein, designated PamA (encoded by sll0985), as a PII-binding protein in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The interaction between PII and PamA was confirmed in vitro, and the interaction was inhibited in the presence of ATP and 2-oxoglutarate, whereas the interaction was not influenced by the phosphorylation status of PII.

The mRNA and protein levels of a group 2 σ factor SigE were also reduced by the pamA mutation, and transcripts for sugar catabolic genes, such as gap1, zwf, and gnd that are under the control of SigE, were consequently decreased in the pamA mutant.

Cyanobacteria are prokaryotes that perform oxygenic photosynthesis similar to that in higher plants and algae. These bacteria coordinately regulate various aspects of cellular metabolism in response to changes in their environment. Carbon and nitrogen are important for cell growth, and the complex metabolism of each of these elements is regulated in synchrony under all conditions. The internal balance of carbon and nitrogen in unicellular cyanobacteria is monitored by the PII sensor protein, which is highly conserved among bacteria, Archaea, and plant chloroplasts (1Ninfa A.J.

Hedler A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The intracellular 2-OG level is assumed to reflect not only the carbon status but also the nitrogen status in cyanobacteria because of the lack of canonical 2-OG dehydrogenase (6Stanier R.Y. Hedler A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1977; 31: 225-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Therefore, PII is considered to be able to integrate energy, carbon, and nitrogen signals by monitoring ATP and 2-OG levels (4Forchhammer K. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 28: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition to ATP and 2-OG binding, Synechococcus and Synechocystis PII proteins are phosphorylated at a serine residue under nitrogen starvation (7Forchhammer K. Tandeau de Marsac N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 8Hisbergues M. Jeanjean R. Joset F. Tandeau de Marsac N. Bedu S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation level is also affected by carbon status (9Forchhammer K. Tandeau de Marsac N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recent analyses revealed that PII dephosphorylation specifically responded to intracellular 2-OG concentrations (10Irmler A. Sanner S. Dierks H. Forchhammer K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).A PII-deficient mutant (MP2) of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 does not inhibit the nitrate/nitrite transporter in the presence of ammonium, which is the preferred nitrogen source for unicellular cyanobacteria; however, it inhibits the nitrate/nitrite transporter in the wild-type strain (11Lee H.-M. Flores E. Herrero A. Houmard J. Tandeau de Marsac N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). High affinity bicarbonate transporters are constitutively activated regardless of the ambient carbon status in a PII-deficient mutant of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (8Hisbergues M. Jeanjean R. Joset F. Tandeau de Marsac N. Bedu S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, it was suggested that carbon metabolism is also regulated by PII in this cyanobacterium. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which the nitrate/nitrite and bicarbonate transporters are regulated by PII remain unknown.The expression of nitrogen-related genes in cyanobacteria is activated by the global nitrogen regulator NtcA, a transcription factor that belongs to the CRP family (12Vega-Palas M.A. Flores E. Herrero A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1853-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Vega-Palas M.A. Madueno F. Herrero A. Flores E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 643-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was recently shown that 2-OG binds directly to NtcA and thereby promotes its interaction with target promoters (14Muro-Pastor M.I. Reyes J.C. Florencio F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38320-38328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Vazquez-Bermudez M.F. Herrero A. Flores E.

A. 2002; 99: 4251-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, both PII and NtcA are two independent 2-OG sensors among cyanobacteria. With regard to the potential role of PII in transcriptional regulation, it was shown that the level of expression of NtcA-regulated genes, such as ntcA, nirA, glnA, and amt1, was reduced in MP2 cells, implicating PII in transcriptional activation of NtcA regulons (17Paz-Yepes J. Flores E. Herrero A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 543: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Aldehni et al. (18Aldehni M.F. Sauer J. Spielhaupter C. Schmid R. Forchhammer K. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2582-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) also revealed that PII was involved in regulating the in vivo activity of the NtcA regulons in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 (18Aldehni M.F. Sauer J. Spielhaupter C. Schmid R. Forchhammer K. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2582-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism for this PII function also remains unclear.At present, there are two proteins known to interact with PII in unicellular cyanobacteria. Irmler and Forchhammer (19Irmler A. Forchhammer K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12978-12983Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) identified a PP2C-type protein phosphatase PphA of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that dephosphorylates phosphorylated PII proteins in vivo and in vitro (19Irmler A. Forchhammer K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12978-12983Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A second PII interacting protein was recently discovered when it was found that PII formed a complex with N-acetyl glutamate kinase, a key enzyme of arginine biosynthesis, and controlled the activity in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 (20Burillo S. Luque I. Fuentes I. Contreras A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3346-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Heinrich A. Maheswaran M. Ruppert U. Forchhammer K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, it remains to be elucidated how PII is involved in transcriptional regulation, and no interacting protein involved in transcriptional regulation has been discovered so far.In this study we used the yeast two-hybrid approach and identified a putative membrane protein PamA that binds PII in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Transcripts for a set of nitrogen-related and sugar catabolic genes were reduced in a pamA mutant, suggesting that PamA might play a role in the control of their transcript abundances.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—The glucose-tolerant strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (GT), isolated by Williams (22Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar), and its pamA deletion mutant were grown on BG-11 plates or in BG-11 liquid medium (5 mm NH4Cl as the nitrogen source) at 30 °C under continuous white light (∼70 μmol of photons m-2 s-1) (23Rippka R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). For photomixotrophic growth, BG-11 plates were supplemented with 5 mm glucose.Yeast Two-hybrid Library Screening—The full-length PII gene, glnB (encoded by open reading frame ssl0707), of Synechocystis sp.

PCC 6803 genome encoding a COOH-terminal portion of PamA (amino acids 475–680) was amplified by PCR with specific primers (see TABLE ONE), digested with ScaI and XhoI, and inserted into the SmaI-XhoI sites of pGEX5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length ssl0707 was amplified with specific primers (see TABLE ONE), digested with StuI and SacI, and inserted into the ScaI-SacI sites of pET35b (Novagen). The constructed plasmids encoding GST-PamA-(475–680) or CBD-PII were introduced separately into E. coli BL21 Codon Plus (Novagen) by transformation, expression of the encoded proteins was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Wako) to 1 liter of LB medium, and the cells were subsequently cultured overnight at 37 °C. The cells were then collected by centrifugation and lysed in a solution containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, and 4.5% Triton X-100, and an insoluble fraction containing the recombinant protein was isolated by centrifugation of the cell lysate at 17,400 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The insoluble fraction was washed with cell lysis buffer, suspended in sterilized water, and solubilized by the addition of half a volume of a solution containing 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The solubilized GST-PamA-(475–680) and CBD-PII proteins were dialyzed against PBS or CBinD buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) or CBinD 100 resin (Novagen), respectively. The total yields of GST-PamA-(475–680) and CBD-PII were ∼4 and 3.5 mg, respectively. Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay.GST Precipitation Assay—Purified GST or GST-PamA-(475–680) (2.5 μg) was bound to 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B, mixed with 3.0 μg of CBD-PII in 400 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100), and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The resin was washed 3 times with 300 μl of binding buffer, suspended in an equal volume of SDS sample buffer (1 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 12% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.04% bromphenol blue), and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. The released proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with antibodies specific to the CBD tag (Novagen).Production of Anti-PII and PamA Antiserum and Immunoblotting—For the production of anti-PII and PamA antiserum, fusion proteins were purified as described above. The protein concentrations and purities were examined by Bio-Rad protein assay and SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant staining, respectively. Each 2 mg of purified PII and PamA protein was injected into rabbits, and the antiserum production was performed by Qiagen (Tokyo, Japan). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (24Tanaka K. Takayanagi Y. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Takahashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).Far Western Blotting—3.0 μg of GST or GST-PamA-(475–680) protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE with a 12% gel, and blotted onto Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore). Cyanobacterial cell extracts containing nonphosphorylated or full-phosphorylated PII protein were prepared from an ammonia-grown GT cell culture or a GT cell culture deprived of nitrogen for 4 h. Cells were disrupted by sonication (30 s 5 times) in ice-cold PBS-T (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma)), and debris was removed by centrifugation (17,400 g × 10 min). In previous experiments we found that the amount of PII protein was increased 2.1 times under this nitrogen deprivation condition (data not shown). Subsequently, 100 μg (for ammonia grown cells) or 48 μg (for nitrogen-deprived cells) of protein was used for the reaction with the membrane in 10 ml of PBS-T for 3 h at 4°C. After washes with PBS-T (10 min 5 times), binding proteins were cross-linked by 0.5% formaldehyde in PBS-T at room temperature for 30 min. The reactions were quenched by incubation with 2% glycine in PBS-T for 10 min and then washed with PBS-T (10 min 2 times). The membranes were incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin, and PII associated with GST or GST-PamA-(475–680) was detected by the anti-PII antiserum. For Far Western analysis with endogenous PamA, 3.0 μg of CBD-PII protein was similarly electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a membrane as described above. To prepare cell extracts, cells were disrupted by sonication (30 s 5 times), and PamA proteins were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100(Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C. Debris was removed after centrifugation at 17,400 g for 10 min. 1.6 mg of protein was incubated with the membrane in 10 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 for 3 h at 4 °C followed by washing with the same buffer (10 min 3 times). The subsequent steps were performed as mentioned above.Construction of a pamA Deletion Mutant—A 5.5-kbp HpaI fragment of cosmid cs0120 (25Shestopalov V.I. Nashchokina O.O. Shestakov S.V. Iankovskii N.K. Genetica. 1994; 30: 452-455Google Scholar) containing pamA was subcloned into pTZ18R (Amersham Biosciences) that had been digested with HincII, ensuring that the orientation of pamA was the same as that of the lacZ gene of the vector. The resulting plasmid, p0985, was digested with SmaI and XhoI, rendered blunt-ended with a DNA Blunting Kit (TaKaRa), and self-ligated to eliminate the BamHI site in the polylinker region. The new plasmid was digested with BamHI, resulting in the deletion of an ∼2.4-kbp fragment (from the +165 position of the pamA-coding region to the 3′ end of the downstream transposase gene sll0986), and the deleted portion was replaced with a kanamycin resistance cassette (26Reece K.S. Phillips G.J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 165: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) to yield p0985B. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells were transformed with p0985B and selected on BG-11 plates containing kanamycin (10 μg/ml).Isolation of RNA and Northern Blot Analysis—Cells of mid-exponential phase cultures of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (A750, 0.5–0.7) grown in BG-11 medium were collected by filtration and resuspended in BG-110 medium (BG-11 without NH4Cl). After culturing for 0 or 4 h, the cells were collected and subjected to RNA extraction by the acid phenol-chloroform method as previously described (27Los D.A. Ray M.K. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1167-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of the isolated RNA was performed as described previously (28Kanamaru K. Nagashima A. Fujiwara M. Shimada H. Shirano Y. Nakabayashi K. Shibata D. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1034-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For the construction of gene-specific probes, we amplified the corresponding coding region by PCR with specific primers (see TABLE ONE) and labeled the PCR products with digoxigenin with the use of a DIG DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Applied Science).Complementation of the pamA Mutant—A DNA fragment including the pamA gene was obtained by digestion of the p0985 plasmid with SacII and EcoRV. The resulting 3.3-kbp fragment was blunt-ended with a DNA blunting kit (TaKaRa) and inserted into the cyanobacterial autonomous replication plasmid pVZ322 (29Zinchenko V.V. Piven I.V. Melnik V.A.

The resultant complementation vectors, namely, pVZ322:pamAC, were introduced into GN10 cells by triparental gene transfer (29Zinchenko V.V. Piven I.V. Melnik V.A. Shestakov S.V. Rus. J. Genet. 1999; 35: 228-232Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIdentification of a PII-binding Protein by Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screening of 3.8 × 106 independent clones of a Synechocystis genomic library with Synechocystis PII as bait yielded four positive clones. One of these four clones contained the PII gene (glnB) itself, consistent with the trimeric nature of PII, and the other three clones were found to harbor the 3′ terminal region of a predicted gene sll0985. The potential protein encoded by sll0985 comprised 680 amino acids and contained seven membrane-spanning segments, as predicted by the SOSUI program (30Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Analysis of sequence similarity with the BLAST program indicated that this protein belonged to the protein family defined by the MSC mechanosensitive ion channel of E. coli (31Pivetti C.D. Yen M.R. Miller S. Busch W. Tseng Y.-H. BoothI R. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 66-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that PII interacted with amino acids 571–680 of Sll0985, located in the COOH-terminal tail region (amino acids 498–680) of the protein, a region that is well conserved among several cyanobacterial proteins (Fig. 1B). We designated the hypothetical gene sll0985 as pamA (PII-associated membrane protein A).Interaction of PII with PamA in Vitro—To confirm in vitro the interaction between PII and PamA, as detected by the yeast two-hybrid screening, we expressed a GST fusion protein containing the COOH-terminal region (residues 475–680) of PamA in E. coli and purified the recombinant protein to homogeneity by glutathione affinity chromatography (Fig. 2A). PII was similarly expressed as a CBD fusion protein and purified to homogeneity. Either GST-PamA-(475–680) or GST bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was then incubated with CBD-PII. The beads were isolated by centrifugation, and bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the CBD tag. CBD-PII was found to coprecipitate with GST-PamA-(475–680) but not with GST (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, although neither ATP nor 2-OG alone affected the interaction between PamA and PII in vitro, the presence of both 1 mm ATP and 1 mm 2-OG prevented the association of the two proteins (Fig. 2B). In Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, the binding of 2-OG to PII has previously been shown to require the presence of ATP (5Forchhammer K. Hedler A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our results may suggest that PII binds with PamA under nitrogen-repleted conditions and dissociates under nitrogen-limited conditions.FIGURE 2Interaction of PII with the COOH-terminal region of PamA in vitro. A, purification of recombinant PII and PamA. CBD-PII and GST-PamA-(475–680) fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified by affinity chromatography, resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. B, GST pull-down assay with purified recombinant PII and PamA fusion proteins. GST or GST-PamA-(475–680) bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was incubated with CBD-PII in the absence or presence of 1 mm ATP or 1 mm 2-OG as indicated, after which bead-bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the CBD tag. M, molecular mass markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further analyze the interaction between PII and PamA, we performed Far Western blotting analyses. GST or GST-PamA-(475–680) protein was resolved in a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted onto a membrane. To examine the effect of PII phosphorylation on the PII-PamA interaction, cell extracts were prepared from ammonia-grown or nitrogen-starved GT cells and incubated with the membrane, and bound PII was detected with PII-specific antiserum. Both nonphosphorylated (ammonia-grown) and fully phosphorylated (nitrogen-starved) PII could interact with GST-PamA-(475–680) but not with GST (Fig. 3A). This indicates that phosphorylation states do not affect the PII-PamA interaction. 2-OG was increased immediately after nitrogen starvation (increased ∼2-fold, 15 min after nitrogen depletion), whereas phosphorylation of PII proteins only took place 1 h after nitrogen depletion (14Muro-Pastor M.I. Reyes J.C. Florencio F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38320-38328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these results imply that PII and PamA proteins may be promptly dissociated under nitrogen starvation by 2-OG accumulation.FIGURE 3Far Western analysis with the recombinant or endogenous PamA proteins. A, 3.0 μg of GST or GST-PamA-(475–680) was electrophoresed with a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted onto Immobilon-P membrane. Cell extracts containing nonphosphorylated PII or full-phosphorylated PII were incubated with the membranes, and the associated PII proteins were detected by anti-PII antiserum. Signals were visualized by reaction with alkali phosphatases with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium as a substrate. As a control reaction, 1.5 μg of GST and GST-PamA-(475–680) was resolved in the same gel and detected by anti-GST antibody (Molecular Probe). B, Far Western analysis with the endogenous PamA protein. 3.0 μg of purified CBD-PII protein was resolved with a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. GT cell extracts containing the endogenous PamA protein was incubated with the membrane, and the PamA protein was detected with anti-PamA antiserum. Anti-SigE antiserum was used as a negative control. Detection of 0.6 μg of the recombinant PII protein with the anti-PII antiserum is shown in the right panel for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Additionally, we examined the effect of PamA truncation on the PII interaction (Fig. 3B). In brief, purified CBD-PII was electrophoresed and blotted onto a membrane. Cell lysates prepared from GT cells were incubated with this filter, and endogenous PamA, interacting with the filter bound PII, was detected with the PamA antiserum. The results showed that native PamA could also interact with PII, denying an artificial interaction by the PamA truncation.Transcripts of Nitrogen-related Genes Were Decreased by the pamA Mutation—To analyze the functions of PamA, we constructed a pamA deletion mutant (GN10) of Synechocystis by transforming cells with a targeting plasmid in which a genomic fragment from the 5′ region of pamA to the 3′ end of the downstream transposase gene sll0986 was replaced by a kanamycin resistance cassette (Fig. 4A). This pamA deletion mutant grew equally well as the parental GT strain (data not shown). However, Northern blot analysis of the RNA expression of a set of nitrogen-related genes revealed that the transcripts of nblA, nrt-ABCD, and ureG were greatly reduced in GN10 compared with the GT strain (Fig. 4B). nblA (whose product is responsible for phycobilisome degradation) and the nrtABCD operon (which encodes the nitrate/nitrite transporter) are known to be regulated by NtcA (32Collier J.L. Grossman A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 33Richaud C. Zabulon G. Joder A. Thomas J.-C. J.

On the other hand, the transcripts of other NtcA-regulated genes such as glnA (which encodes glutamine synthetase type I), glnB, amt1 (which encodes the ammonium transporter), and glnN (which encodes glutamine synthetase type III) were less affected by the pamA mutation (Fig. 4C). These genes, except for ureG, are known to be controlled by NtcA (36Herrero A. Muro-Pastor A.M. Flores E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The ureG gene, which encodes a urease accessory protein, was shown to be regulated by NtcA in Prochlorococcus marinus PCC 9511 (37Palinska K.A. Jahns T. Ripppka R. Tandeau de Marsac N. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 3099-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and, therefore, could also be regulated by NtcA in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. These results indicate that only a set of NtcA-regulated genes was affected by PamA disruption, suggesting that genes included in NtcA regulons might be sub-grouped by differential controls. Thus, the pamA function is involved in the expression of a part of the NtcA-regulated genes.FIGURE 4A, disruption of pamA in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. A 2.4-kbp BamHI fragment containing pamA and the putative downstream transposase gene was deleted and replaced with a kanamycin resistance cassette (1.2 kbp). The resulting deletion mutant GN10 was confirmed by PCR with specific primers (TABLE ONE). B and C, Northern blot analysis of nitrogen-related genes in GT and GN10 cells. Total RNA was isolated from GT or GN10 cells 0 or 4 h after nitrogen deprivation and was subjected to Northern blot analysis (8 μg of RNA/lane) with probes specific for the indicated genes. The positions of molecular size markers are indicated in kilobases. As a control, rRNA was stained with methylene blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownl"

In the sumoylation pathway, SUMO/Smt3 is transferred to substrate lysine residues through the thioester cascade of E1 (activating enzyme) and E2 (conjugating enzyme), and E3 (SUMO ligase) functions as an adaptor between E2 and each substrate. Yeast Ull1 (ubiquitin-like protein ligase 1)/Siz1, a PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT)-type SUMO ligase, modifies both cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. In this paper, we performed a domain analysis of Ull1/Siz1 by constructing various deletion mutants. A novel conserved N-terminal domain, called PINIT, as well as the RING-like domain (SP-RING) were required for the SUMO ligase activity in the in vitro conjugation system and for interaction with Smt3 in an in vitro binding assay. The most distal N-terminal region, which contains a putative DNA-binding SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS (SAP) motif, was not required for the ligase activity but was involved in nuclear localization. A strong SUMO-binding motif was identified, which interacted with Smt3 in the two-hybrid system but was not necessary for the ligase activity. The most distal C-terminal domain was important for stable localization at the bud neck region and thereby for the substrate recognition of septins. Furthermore, the C-terminal half conferred protein instability on Ull1/Siz1. Taken together, we conclude that the SP-RING and PINIT of Ull1/Siz1 are core domains of the SUMO ligase, and the other domains are regulatory for protein stability and subcellular localization.

The E1 enzymes are heterodimers known as Uba2-Aos1 for the yeast Smt3 system and form a thioester bond between the C-terminal glycine residue of SUMO and the cysteine residue of Uba2 (9Dohmen R.J.

Eventually, SUMO1/Smt3 ligases (E3s) were discovered and found to be required for both substrate recognition and promoting conjugation. Yeast Ull1/Siz1, a member of the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) family, was identified as an E3 factor specific for septin components (13Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A.

Cell. 2001; 107: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), a putative zinc-binding RING-like domain with an octet of ordered cysteine and histidine residues essential for the ligase activity in vivo and in vitro, just like certain ubiquitin-ligase components (19Jackson P.K.

Ull1/Siz1 exhibits cell cycle-dependent subcellular localization; Ull1/Siz1 localizes in the nucleus before the G2/M phase and accumulates in the M phase at the bud neck region, a junction between a mother cell and its bud (13Johnson E.S.

Consistent with this result, both cytoplasmic (Cdc3, Cdc11, and Shs1) and nuclear proteins, such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Pol30), have been identified as target proteins of Ull1/Siz1 (21Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). In addition, Ull1ΔC440, a C-terminal truncated form of Ull1/Siz1 always localizes in the nucleus but functions as a SUMO ligase for Cdc3 in the in vitro conjugation system (22Takahashi Y. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These results raise the question of how Ull1/Siz1 is regulated in both cellular compartments. The Ull1 protein (we use Ull1 (ubiquitin-like protein ligase 1) in this report) is composed of 904 amino acids and carries two domains and two motifs (see Fig. 1). The SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS (SAP) domain (aa 34–68) with the LXXLL signature in the N-terminal region may interact with DNA, because PIAS-SAP binds to DNA (23Okubo S. Hara F. Shimotakahara S. Suzuki S. Hatanaka H. Yokoyama S. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Shindo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31455-31461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A newly identified PINIT motif has been defined as a well conserved region of 180 residues in the PIAS family and is involved in nuclear retention (24Duval G. Kedinger C. Poch O. Boeuf H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This motif may be located between aa 181 and 349, which is adjacent to the SP-RING domain (aa 352–409). A putative SXS motif, originally reported as a SUMO-interacting motif (25Minty A. Dumont X. Kaghad M. Caput D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), may be located around aa 490 of the Ull1 sequence. However, it has been reported recently that a true SUMO binding motif was identified as SBM, which resides adjacent to the SXS motif of PIAS proteins (26Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether Ull1 contains the SBM in the equivalent region. Here we present our in vitro and in vivo assay findings, using various truncated forms of Ull1, and demonstrate that Ull1, a SUMO ligase, is regulated through subcellular localization and protein stability.

To construct pT-89 (pGAL-GFP-ull1-(1–326)), a DNA fragment from the N terminus to the 326th amino acid of the ULL1 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using ULL1-N ATG-SalI (5′-GCGCGTCGACATGATAAATTTAGAGGATTACTG-3′) and ULL1-N326-SalI (5′-GCGCGTCGACATGCTGTAATACTTTTTCCAGG-3′) primers, cut with SalI, and inserted into a pGAL-GFP vector so as to express GFP-X fusion proteins under the GAL1 promoter. pT-92 (pGAL-GFP-ull1-(112–326)) was constructed by cloning the SpeI-SalI DNA fragment from pT-82 into the pGAL-GFP vector. pT-97 (pGAL-GFP-ull1-(1–103)) was constructed from pT-89 by deleting the DNA fragment from the endogenous BglII site to the HindIII site of the vector. pT-110 (pGAL-ULL1ΔC440-(1–465)-HA) and pT-115 (pGAL-ULL1-(1–904)-HA) contained the SalI fragments of ull1ΔC440 and ULL1 open reading frame in the pTS911CU vector, respectively (32Sasaki T. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7971-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). pT-98 (pGBDU-Ull1-(466–793)) was constructed by cloning the SalI fragment generated by PCR into the pGBDU vector (30James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pT-99 (pGBDU-Ull1-(466–611)) contained the EcoRI-XhoI fragment from pT-98. pT-104 carried the same fragment of pT-99, but two mutations were generated by PCR, using the primer SXS-D487A,D489A (TTGCTATCATCATGATTATTAGTAACATGAGGATTATTTCCATTTGGTTCGTCAGCATCACTAGCGAGATTTATGATAAT). Preparation of the Recombinant Proteins—To express the His- and T7-tagged recombinant proteins, cultures of E. coli BL21 (DE3) carrying pT-82 (pET21a-ull1-N1), pT-83 (pET21a-ull1-N2), pT-84 (pET21a-ull1-RING), or pT-77 (pET21b-ull1ΔC440) (22Takahashi Y. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were grown to midlog phase, and each recombinant protein was induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were collected, resuspended in lysis buffer 2 (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and disrupted by sonication. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatant fractions of His-Ull1 mutant proteins were incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, as instructed by the manufacturer (Qiagen). For the purification of the GST-Smt3gg, GST-Uba2, GST-Aos1, GST-Ubc9, and GST proteins, cultures of E. coli BL21 (DE3) carrying pT-35 (pGEX-KG-SMT3gg), pT-58 (pGEX-KG-UBA2), pT-59 (pGEX-KG-AOS1), pT-60 (pGEX-KG-UBC9) and pGEX-KG, respectively, were grown to the midlog phase, and 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to express the recombinant proteins at 37 °C for 3 h. Each cell lysate, prepared as above, was mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 2 h. After the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer 2, each protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and the samples were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 3 mm MgCl2. For the preparation of the untagged mature form of Smt3 and Ubc9, the GST-Smt3gg and GST-Ubc9 bound to beads were treated with thrombin, and the supernatants were dialyzed to remove glutathione, as described previously (22Takahashi Y. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In Vitro Conjugation Assay—All of the components, Smt3gg, T7-Cdc3-His, GST-Uba2, GST-Aos1, Ubc9, and Ull1 derivatives, were purified from E. coli lysates, as described above. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) of Cdc3, GST-Uba2, GST-Aos1, Ubc9, and Smt3gg were incubated with Ull1 derivatives (Ull1ΔC440, Ull1-N1, Ull1-N2, and Ull1-RING) in the presence of 10 mm ATP, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, and 2mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 90 min, as described previously (22Takahashi Y. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Preparation of Yeast Cell Lysates and Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates for immunoblotting were prepared as described previously (14Takahashi Y. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 275: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) or by an alkaline method (33Kushnirov V.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). For the experiment shown in Fig. 6B, cells of T-13 (Δull1) carrying pT-115 (pGAL-ULL1-HA) or pT-110 (pGAL-ull1ΔC440-HA) were grown in S-raffinose medium at 25 °C and arrested with hydroxyurea or nocodazol for 2 h. One percent galactose was added to the cultures to express the Ull1 proteins, and 1 h later, 2% glucose was added to the cultures to shut off the transcription (0′). Samples were taken at 15 min (15′) and 30 min (30′). The cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting. Immunoblotting analysis was performed, as described previously (14Takahashi Y. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 275: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), using anti-T7-horseradish peroxidase (Novagen), anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science), and 2 μg/ml anti-HA (16B12; Babco) mouse monoclonal antibodies and 0.2 μg/ml anti-PSTAIRE (sc-53; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Cdc3 (a gift from J. Pringle), anti-GST, and 0.2 μg/ml anti-Cdc11 (y-415; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) rabbit polyclonal antibodies. As secondary antibodies, 1.5 μl of horseradish peroxidase conjugate of goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG was used for a 1-h incubation at room temperature. Bands were detected with detection reagent (New Life Science Products) as instructed by the manufacturer. Sumoylation of Cdc3 was quantified by measurement of modified forms of Cdc3 using NIH Image. Phosphatase inhibitors were included in the experiments of Figs. 6 and 7A, as described previously (34Cairns B.R. Ramer S.W. Kornberg R.D.

Kahyo T. Toh-e A. Yasuda H. Kikuchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48973-48977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), using purified T7-tagged proteins, T7-Ull1-N1, T7-Ull1-N2, and T7-Ull1-RING. Morphological Observation—Images were recorded by an Olympus IX70 instrument with a SENSYS III cooled charge-coupled device CCD camera using IP Lab software (Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan). Essential Domains for the SUMO Ligase Activity—We have previously shown that the SP-RING of Ull1 is essential to the ligase activity for septin sumoylation in vivo and in vitro (14Takahashi Y. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 275: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Takahashi Y. Kahyo T. Toh-e A. Yasuda H. Kikuchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48973-48977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and that a C-terminal truncated form of Ull1 (Ull1ΔC440) possesses SUMO ligase activity in vitro (22Takahashi Y. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To narrow down the region essential for the in vitro ligase activity, we prepared the various truncated forms of Ull1 shown in Fig. 1 and assayed them in the in vitro conjugation system (Fig. 2A). All of the components, Smt3gg (a mature from of Smt3), E1, E2, the T7-tagged Ull1 derivatives, and Cdc3, were prepared from E. coli lysates, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both Ull1-N1-(112–465) and Ull1ΔC440-(1–465) promoted the sumoylation of Cdc3 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, neither Ull1-RING-(318–465) nor Ull1-N2-(223–465) possessed the SUMO ligase activity. These results indicate that a region containing the PINIT motif (residues 181–349) in addition to SP-RING-(352–409) is required for the sumoylation of Cdc3 in vitro and that the most distal N-terminal region containing the SAP-domain (residues 34–68) is not necessary for the SUMO ligase activity. It should be noted that the primary structure of Ull1-N1 is weakly similar to that of Mms21, a recently identified component of the SUMO ligase complex (35Zhao X. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4777-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Without any additional substrate proteins in this in vitro system, T7-tagged Ull1ΔC440 was found to be modified. New bands corresponding to the Smt3 conjugates of Ull1ΔC440 were detected after incubation (Fig. 2B, lane 11). When GST-Smt3 was used in place of untagged Smt3, new bands of an increased size were detected in lane 12. The size difference between these major bands apparently corresponded to the size of GST. In contrast, Ull1-N1, Ull1-N2, and Ull1-RING were not modified at a detectable level (lanes 1–9). These results suggest that in the in vitro system Ull1ΔC440 is sumoylated and an autosumoylation site(s) exists within the N-terminal 111-amino acid sequence containing the SAP domain. There are eight lysine residues in this region, but none are consensus acceptor lysine residues ((I/V/L)KX(D/E)) for sumoylation (13Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Characterization of the N-terminal Domains—To examine which protein directly interacts with these N-terminal domains, we performed a binding assay. GST, GST-Ubc9, and GST-Smt3 proteins were prepared from E. coli lysates and bound to Sepharose beads. T7-Ull1 derivatives were prepared from E. coli lysates and mixed with the beads. After washing, the bound proteins were subjected to immunoblotting, using an anti-T7 antibody to detect Ull1 derivatives. As shown in Fig. 3, Ubc9 strongly bound to Ull1-RING-(318–465) (lane 9), which is consistent with the result of the two-hybrid interaction (15Takahashi Y. Kahyo T. Toh-e A. Yasuda H. Kikuchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48973-48977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Ubc9 bound to Ull1-N1-(112–465) (lane 7) and only weakly to Ull1-N2-(223–465) (lane 8). In contrast, GST-Smt3 bound to Ull1-N1 (lane 10) but not to Ull1-N2 (lane 11) or Ull1-RING (lane 12). These results suggest that the N-terminal region of Ull1-N1-(112–465) is necessary for direct interaction with Smt3. Next, we examined the localization of various GFP-tagged truncated forms of Ull1 expressed from the GAL1 promoter (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, GFP-Ull1-N0-(1–103), containing the SAP domain, was localized in the nucleus and also diffusibly in the cytoplasm. GFP-Ull1-N-(1–326) was localized as distinct dots in the nucleus. GFP-Ull1-N10-(112–326) containing the PINIT motif was localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B). This result was unexpected, because the PINIT of the PIAS protein was reported to be involved in nuclear retention (24Duval G. Kedinger C. Poch O. Boeuf H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the nuclear localizing signal resides within or near the SAP domain, but not in the PINIT motif, and that the PINIT motif may be involved instead in formation of the nuclear aggregates. The C-terminal Domain of Ull1 Is Required for Bud Neck Localization— Our previous study suggested that the C-terminal half of Ull1 is required for the bud neck localization (22Takahashi Y. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To examine this further, we constructed various plasmids carrying each C-terminal truncated form of ULL1 fused to GFP and expressed from its own promoter (Fig. 5A). The wild-type Ull1-(1–904)-GFP was localized at the neck region in the M phase, when the cell cycle was arrested with a microtubule-destabilizing drug nocodazole (Fig. 5B). Ull1-C1-(1–793)-GFP, which lacks the C-terminal 111 amino acids, was diffusibly localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. In contrast, Ull1-C2-(1–682)-GFP, Ull1-C3-(1–571)-GFP, Ull1ΔC440-(1–465)-GFP and Ull1-N-(1–326)-GFP were exclusively accumulated in the nucleus. In accordance with these results, the proportion of sumoylated forms of HA-Cdc3 was 36% in cells expressing Ull1-C1-GFP (Fig. 5C, lane 2) and 15% in Ull1-C2-GFP (lane 3), when compared with the sumoylated forms of HA-Cdc3 in the wild type Ull1-GFP (lane 1). HA-tagged Cdc3 was not modified with Smt3 in the presence of Ull1-C3-GFP (6%), Ull1ΔC440-GFP (4%), or Ull1-N-GFP (3%) (Fig. 5C). Thus, the C-terminal 111-amino acid sequence of Ull1 is required for the stable localization at the neck region to recognize substrate. And the C-terminal 222-amino acid sequence of Ull1 is responsible for cytoplasmic localization in the M phase. The Instability of the Ull1 Protein—The inability to promote the sumoylation of septin components by the Ull1 derivatives could be due to the instability of the proteins. To examine the protein level of each Ull1 derivative, immunoblotting analysis was performed, as shown in Fig. 6A. The steady state level of GFP-Ull1 (lanes 1 and 2), GFP-Ull1-C1 (lanes 3 and 4), or GFP-Ull1-C2 (lanes 5 and 6) was lower than that of the smaller proteins, GFP-Ull1-C3 (lanes 7 and 8), GFP-Ull1ΔC440 (lanes 9 and 10), or GFP-Ull1-N (lanes 11 and 12) when cells were arrested in either the S phase with hydroxyurea (HU) (odd lanes) or M phase with nocodazole (NZ) (even lanes). To confirm that the C-terminal region is involved in protein instability, Ull1-HA and Ull1ΔC440-(1–465)-HA were expressed from the GAL1 promoter in the presence of HU or NZ, the transcription was shut off by adding glucose, and samples were taken at various time points to examine the protein decay. As shown in Fig. 6B, the protein level of Ull1-HA decreased in either the S or M phase. In contrast, the protein level of Ull1ΔC440 did not change in either, indicating that Ull1ΔC440 is a stable protein. Thus, the instability of the C-terminal region of the Ull1 protein evidently influences the steady state level of the protein. Cell Cycle-dependent Regulation of Ull1—To search for factors to affect the cell cycle dependence of the Ull1 protein level, we tested various mutants involved in the M phase. HA-tagged Ull1 was introduced into a temperature-sensitive cdc20-3 mutant. The CDC20 gene encodes an activator of anaphase-promoting complex, and a temperature-sensitive cdc20-3 mutant induces arrest at the G2/M phase with a high cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) activity at the restrictive temperature. As shown in Fig. 7A, Ull1 was highly phosphorylated in the cdc20 mutant, particularly in the cells arrested at the restrictive temperature (lane 10). At the same time, Cdc11 was sumoylated in the cdc20 mutant (lower panel). Next, we introduced HA-tagged ULL1 into cdc28-1N cells carrying an allele that specifically arrests at the G2/M phase at high temperatures. When cell extracts were prepared from random cultures, arrested in the presence of nocodazole in the M phase at 25 °C or the M phase at 37 °C, the Ull1 protein level was almost undetectable (Fig. 7A, lanes 2–4). Consistent with these results, the Smt3 conjugates of Cdc11 decreased in the cdc28-1N mutant (Fig. 7A, bottom). To confirm whether this phenotype was really CDC28-dependent, we tested another cdc28-1N strain with a different genetic background. The protein level of Ull1-HA in the mutant was very low when cells were arrested in the G2/M phase in the presence of NZ (Fig. 7B, lane 2) or at high temperatures (lane 8), and the sumoylation of Cdc11 was not detected. On the other hand, if CDC28 was supplied from a plasmid in this strain, a large amount of Ull1-HA was detected and partially phosphorylated in the presence of NZ (lane 1) or at high temperatures (lane 7), and the sumoylation of Cdc11 was recovered. As described previously (15Takahashi Y. Kahyo T. Toh-e A. Yasuda H. Kikuchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48973-48977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the protein level of Ull1S460C, carrying a mutation at a putative CDK target serine residue was similar to the wild type Ull1 (lanes 3, 4, 9, and 10), and the septin sumoylation was not impaired. A Putative SXS Motif—The SXS motif was first reported as a SUMO1-binding motif in PIAS proteins (25Minty A. Dumont X. Kaghad M. Caput D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In fact, a truncated form of Ull1 carrying a putative SXS motif (484NLDSDDDE491) strongly interacted with Smt3 in the two-hybrid system, and when the motif was mutated to D486A,D489A, the mutant form (NLA486SDA489DE) was defective in the two-hybrid interaction (Fig. 8), although the protein was present (data not shown). However, we did not find any defects in the sumoylation of Cdc11 and Cdc3-HA in ULL1-D486A,D489A cells (data not shown). We characterized various truncated forms of Ull1 and identified certain critical domains. It has been established that SP-RING is essential for the ligase activity in vivo and in vitro (13Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 14Takahashi Y. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 275: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Takahashi Y. Kahyo T. Toh-e A. Yasuda H. Kikuchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48973-48977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22Takahashi Y. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The present study showed that the most distal N-terminal domain containing a putative DNA binding SAP domain was not necessary for the ligase activity (Fig. 2A), but the adjacent region (the PINIT motif) of SP-RING was necessary for the ligase activity when Cdc3 was used as a substrate in the in vitro reaction, because Ull1-N1-(112–465) was functional, but Ull1-N2-(223–465) was not (Fig. 2A). What is a role of the PINIT motif? This domain appears to be required for the direct interaction with Smt3, as shown in the binding assay (Fig. 3). Recently, a SUMO-interacting domain was identified as the SBM motif (VX(V/I)(V/I)) found in the adjacent region of the SXS motif of PIASX-N and PIASX-P, in PML-P, SAE2-P, and the IR1 region of RanBP2 (26Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Ull1, a PIAS family member, contains the sequence 480PIIINL near the putative SXS motif, which could be an SBM, and the two-hybrid interaction, shown in Fig. 8, may support this notion. On the other hand, a sequence like 192LVMNVEV within the PINIT motif of Ull1 might be an Smt3 binding motif, because a weak binding region of Smt3 may be located within the sequence from aa 112 to 222 (Fig. 3). Furthermore, Reverter and Lima (36Reverter D. Lima C.D. Nature. 2005; 435: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) have suggested that RanBP2 acts as E3 by binding both SUMO and Ubc9 so as to position the SUMO-E2-thioester in the optimal orientation to enhance conjugation. We speculate that a putative SBM within the Ull1 PINIT motif is a receptor for Smt3 bound to Ubc9 through a thioester bond, which would be crucial for the ligase activity. In contrast, the other strong Smt3 binding region, including the putative SXS motif, shown in Fig. 8, could exert functions other than the accommodation of the SUMO-E2 complex, because it is not required for the SUMO ligase activity. The most distal N-terminal domain seems to carry an acceptor site for autosumoylation in vitro (Fig. 2B). This domain contains a putative DNA binding SAP domain (23Okubo S. Hara F. Shimotakahara S. Suzuki S. Hatanaka H. Yokoyama S. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Shindo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31455-31461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Siz1/Ull1 may sumoylate a nuclear Top2 (topoisomerase II), and an excessive sumoylation of Top2 in an smt4-SUMO hydrolase mutant is reported to cause temperature-sensitive cellular growth (37Bachant J. Alcasabas A. Blat Y. Kleckner N. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). It is possible that the autosumoylation may disturb the DNA binding, which might in turn facilitate release from the chromosomes. Although some of the truncated forms of Ull1 did not sumoylate septin components in vivo, they did possess the ligase activity in vitro (22Takahashi Y. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 4Y. Takahashi and Y. Kikuchi, unpublished results. Thus, the localization of the E3 components is crucial for the substrate determination in vivo. The C-terminal 111-amino acid sequence was required for the stable bud neck localization of Ull1, thereby recognizing the septin components as substrates, and the C-terminal 222 amino acid sequence may be necessary for its nuclear export (Fig. 5). We tested which factor was involved in altering the subcellular localization. The result was not clear; the subcellular localization of Ull1 only partially depended on Msn5, an export carrier, and not on Xpo1. 4Y. Takahashi and Y. Kikuchi, unpublished results. Another redundant carrier may export Ull1. Alternatively, it is possible that Ull1 is not a direct cargo of Msn5, and unknown Msn5-dependent factors may help Ull1 to facilitate the bud neck localization indirectly. Consistent with this hypothesis, Msn5 failed to bind to Ull1 in a binding assay using bacterially expressed Msn5 protein. 4Y. Takahashi and Y. Kikuchi, unpublished results. The C-terminal domain seems to confer the protein instability on Ull1 (Fig. 6). The longer the C-terminal tail Ull1 possesses, the less stable it becomes, which suggests that multiple domains are involved. When the M phase CDK activity was low in the cdc28–1N mutant, the Ull1 protein level was also low (Fig. 7). In contrast, when the CDK activity was high in the cdc20 mutant, the protein level was high. Ull1 contains many potential CDK target sites. We found that the mutation of the classical CDK target site (serine 460) did not affect the function of ULL1 (Fig. 7B). It remains to be determined whether Ull1 is phosphorylated directly by CDK. What is the biological significance of the long C-terminal extension of Ull1? Among the known SUMO ligases in yeast (Ull1/Siz1, Nfi1, and Mms21), Ull1 is the only protein that changes its subcellular localization in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The other yeast PIAS family proteins are always localized in the nucleus. One may speculate that this is needed to reduce the level of nuclear sumoylation in the M phase by exporting a SUMO ligase to the cytoplasm. In this case, the septin ring functions as a reservoir of the ligase. Alternatively, Ull1 might be required at the bud neck region to sumoylate septins, etc., for as yet unidentified purposes. In summary, Ull1/Siz1, a PIAS family protein, contains multiple domains, and both the SP-RING and PINIT motifs are essential for the SUMO ligase activity. The other domains are involved in its own regulation for the protein stability and subcellular localization. We thank J. Pringle for antibody, K. Nasmyth and E. Craig for strains, E. Craig and T.

https://openalex.org/W2160054964,"The external loop linking the M2 and M3 transmembrane domains is crucial for coupling agonist binding to channel gating in the glycine receptor chloride channel (GlyR). A substituted cysteine accessibility scan previously showed that glycine activation increased the surface accessibility of 6 contiguous residues (Arg271– Lys276) toward the N-terminal end of the homomeric α1 GlyR M2–M3 loop. In the present study we used a similar approach to determine whether the allosteric antagonist, picrotoxin, could impose conformational changes to this domain that cannot be induced by varying agonist concentrations alone. Picrotoxin slowed the reaction rate of a sulfhydryl-containing compound (MTSET) with A272C, S273C, and L274C. Before interpreting this as a picrotoxin-specific conformational change, it was necessary to eliminate the possibility of steric competition between picrotoxin and MTSET. Accordingly, we showed that picrotoxin and the structurally unrelated blocker, bilobalide, were both trapped in the R271C GlyR in the closed state and that a point mutation to the pore-lining Thr6′ residue abolished inhibition by both compounds. We also demonstrated that the picrotoxin dissociation rate was linearly related to the channel open probability. These observations constitute a strong case for picrotoxin binding in the pore. We thus conclude that the picrotoxin-specific effects on the M2–M3 loop are mediated allosterically. This suggests that the M2–M3 loop responds differently to the occupation of different binding sites.

Like other members of the cysteine-loop ligand-gated ion channel (LGIC) family, functional GlyRs comprise 5 subunits arranged symmetrically around a central ion-conducting pore. Each subunit consists of a large extracellular ligand-binding domain followed by 4 α-helical transmembrane domains, termed M1–M4 (3Unwin N. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 4Barry P.H. Lynch J.W. IEEE Trans. Nanobiosci. 2005; 4: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).It is now well established that the extramembranous loop joining M2 and M3 is crucial for transmitting the agonist-induced conformational change to the M2 domain activation gate (5Lynch J.W.

Consistent with this role, a substituted cystine accessibility study on the α1 GlyR showed that the surface accessibility of 6 contiguous cysteine-substituted residues in this loop (Arg271 to Lys276) was increased in the open state (9Lynch J.W. Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the conformational status of the M2–M3 loop depends on the degree to which the receptor is activated by agonist. However, it is not known whether allosteric modulators could impose conformational changes to this loop that cannot be induced by simply varying the agonist concentration alone. This is an important question as it could reveal a hitherto unexpected complexity in the role of this important domain. In particular, it would address the hypothesis that the M2–M3 loop conformation can be modified in different ways by different ligands.In this study we address this question by determining whether the closure of the channels by the allosteric inhibitor, picrotoxin (PTX), preserves the relationship between domain conformation and fractional peak current magnitude that is seen in its absence. If this relationship is not preserved, we would conclude that the PTX-induced closed state is conformationally different from the unliganded closed state.PTX inhibits most anionic LGICs including the recombinant α homomeric GlyR, the GABA type-A receptor (GABAAR), and the invertebrate glutamate receptor Cl– channel (GluClR). PTX is a use-dependent inhibitor of GABAAR (10Newland C.F. Cull-Candy S.G. J. Physiol. 1992; 447: 191-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and GluClR (11Etter A. Cully D.F. Liu K.K. Reiss B. Vassilatis D.K. Schaeffer J.M. Arena J.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but displays no use dependence at the α homomeric GlyR (12Lynch J.W.

Although this implies that PTX binds in the pore, it is unlikely that picrotoxin inhibition is because of classic pore block.

PTX may be a useful modulator for the present investigation as mutations in the M2–M3 loop have profound effects on its mode of action (12Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol.

Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The WT and mutant GlyRs investigated in this study incorporated the functionally silent C41A mutation (9Lynch J.W. Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid constructs were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells via the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cells were washed 24 h later, and currents were recorded over the next 72 h.Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Currents were measured using whole cell recording at a holding potential of –40 mV using an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and data were directly recorded to disk using pCLAMP 6 or 9 software (Axon Instruments). Cells were perfused with the standard bathing solution containing (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.4. Patch pipettes had tip resistances of ∼1.5 MΩ when filled with the standard intracellular solution containing (in mm): 145 CsCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, pH 7.4. PTX and bilobalide (BB) (both from Sigma) were stored as 10–100 mm stock solutions in Me2SO for up to 3 months and dissolved into the bath solution on the day of the experiment. Methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium (MTSET), from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada), was prepared as a stock solution of 10 mm in distilled water and maintained on ice for up to 3 h until used. It was applied to cells within 30 s of being dissolved into room temperature bathing solution. The disulfide reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT) was prepared daily as a 1 mm solution in the standard bathing solution. Solutions were applied to cells via a parallel system of gravity-fed tubes, and solution exchange was effected with a time constant of about 100 ms. Experiments were performed at room temperature (19Legendre P. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 2400-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Qian H. Pan Y. Zhu Y. Khalili P. Mol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9112-9117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar °C).The effects of MTSET on glycine-gated currents were tested as follows. Prior to MTSET application, cells were bathed in 1 mm DTT for 1 min to ensure that exposed sulfhydryl groups were fully reduced. Then the glycine dose response was measured at least 3 times over a period of ∼10 min to ensure that EC10 and EC30 glycine concentrations could reliably be chosen and that the current magnitude was invariant (±5%) prior to the application of MTSET. Following application of the MTSET-containing solution, cells were washed in control solution for at least 2 min before the current magnitudes were measured again. This was done to ensure that cysteine modification had taken place. Currents were then reduced to their original control levels by a 1-min exposure to 1–2 mm DTT.Data Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of three or more independent experiments. The empirical Hill equation, fitted by a non-linear least squares algorithm (Sigmaplot 9.0, Systat Software Inc, Richmond, CA), was used to calculate the 50% effective concentrations for PTX inhibition (IC50) and the Hill coefficient (nH) values. Exponential fits were performed using the same non-linear least squares algorithm. Statistical significance was determined by Student's paired or unpaired t test (as indicated) with p < 0.05 representing significance.RESULTSPTX Interactions with the M2–M3 Loop—The peak current magnitudes and glycine EC50 values for all mutant GlyRs examined in this study have previously been published (9Lynch J.W. Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the present study concerns the effects of PTX on M2–M3 loop conformation, it was first necessary to measure the mean PTX IC50 and nH values for the WT and all cysteine-substituted GlyRs. Sample recordings from cells expressing each mutant GlyR examined in this study are shown in Fig. 1A. These show the effects on increasing concentrations of PTX on currents activated by EC30-EC50 glycine concentrations. Averaged PTX dose responses are displayed in Fig. 1B (separated into two panels for clarity) and the mean IC50 and nH values are summarized in TABLE ONE, together with the glycine concentration at which each was measured. These results reveal two general features. First, as shown in TABLE ONE, the nH values for all cysteine mutants were <1, which is significantly less than the nH value for the WT GlyR of around 1.5. These results imply that PTX inhibits the WT GlyR in a cooperative manner, but that this cooperativity is lost when mutations are incorporated into the N-terminal half of the M2–M3 loop. Mutagenesis also significantly increased the PTX sensitivity of most mutants, except for A272C where there was no significant difference, and L274C where there was an ∼5-fold reduction in PTX sensitivity. In agreement with a previous report (12Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13799-13806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), these results indicate that loop mutations affect the allosteric actions of PTX, but they provide no evidence for the direct disruption of a PTX binding site.TABLE ONEPTX sensitivity of WT and mutant GlyRsGlyR[Glycine]aThis shows the glycine concentration used to measure PTX dose responses.PTXIC50nHnmmμmWT0.0318 ± 11.5 ± 0.15R271C37.1 ± 0.9bSignificantly different from WT value using an unpaired t test (p < 0.05).0.77 ± 0.07bSignificantly different from WT value using an unpaired t test (p < 0.05).8A272C317 ± 60.58 ± 0.09bSignificantly different from WT value using an unpaired t test (p < 0.05).4S273C0.040.68 ± 0.04bSignificantly different from WT value using an unpaired t test (p < 0.05).0.78 ± 0.05bSignificantly different from WT value using an unpaired t test (p < 0.05).3L274C0.25103 ± 26bSignificantly different from WT value using an unpaired t test (p < 0.05).0.52 ± 0.07bSignificantly different from WT value using an unpaired t test (p < 0.05).4P275C25.0 ± 1.4bSignificantly different from WT value using an unpaired t test (p < 0.05).0.78 ± 0.09bSignificantly different from WT value using an unpaired t test (p < 0.05).4K276C34.9 ± 1.6bSignificantly different from WT value using an unpaired t test (p < 0.05).0.60 ± 0.06bSignificantly different from WT value using an unpaired t test (p < 0.05).4a This shows the glycine concentration used to measure PTX dose responses.b Significantly different from WT value using an unpaired t test (p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab Our original aim was to determine the effect of PTX on the MTSET reactivity of cysteines introduced individually to positions 271–276 in the α1 GlyR. We previously demonstrated that the MTSET reaction rates for all cysteine-substituted mutants are increased in the channel open state (9Lynch J.W. Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the effect of PTX on cystine accessibility, we first measured the MTSET reaction rates of all mutants at the EC10 and EC30 glycine concentrations. (As MTSET reaction rate is proportional to the degree of receptor activation, we expect this to increase with increasing glycine concentration.) We then added a sufficient concentration of PTX to the EC30 glycine concentration to inhibit the current to the EC10 current magnitude. If the MTSET reaction rate depends only on the channel open probability, then the reaction rates in the presence of PTX + EC30 glycine should be identical to its reaction rate in the presence of EC10 glycine. However, if the respective reaction rates are different, it may be possible to conclude that PTX promotes a conformational state that cannot be attained by glycine.An example of such an experiment performed on the S273C mutant GlyR is shown in Fig. 2A. All traces in this figure are from the same cell. The upper left panel shows the effect of 100 μm MTSET applied in the presence of an EC10 (in this case 30 μm) concentration of glycine. A 2-min wash in control solution had no effect, although the MTSET-induced current increase was completely reversed by a 1-min exposure to 1 mm of the reducing agent, DTT (Fig. 2A). These observations confirm that MTSET acted via a covalent modification of S273C. The time course of the MTSET-induced current change was adequately fitted by a single exponential with a time constant of 1.6 s (upper right panel). The corresponding current changes in the presence of EC30 glycine alone or EC30 glycine + 10 μm PTX were fitted by time constants of 1.1 and 3.8 s, respectively (Fig. 2A, middle and lower panels). The same experimental protocol was applied to 2 other cells expressing the S273C mutant GlyR and the averaged results are summarized in Fig. 2B. These results are normalized to the MTSET reaction rate measured in the presence of EC10 glycine. A paired t test (p < 0.05) indicates that 10 μm PTX + EC30 glycine caused a significant reduction in the MTSET reaction rate with S273C relative to that caused by EC10 glycine (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Effect of PTX on the MTSET reactivity of mutant GlyRs. A, all data in this panel were recorded from the same cell expressing the S273C GlyR. In this and all subsequent figures, the time course of glycine and MTSET application are shown by the unfilled and filled bars, respectively. MTSET was applied at a concentration of 100 μm in all experiments unless otherwise stated. In this cell, the glycine EC10 and EC30 concentrations were 50 and 70 μm, respectively. The upper and middle traces show current responses to MTSET at EC10 and EC30 glycine concentrations, respectively, and the bottom trace shows the effect of simultaneous application of MTSET, EC30 glycine, and 5 μm PTX. Single exponential fits to the MTSET-induced current change are displayed in the right panel. A control glycine application 2 min after MTSET reaction indicates the effect is irreversible. Traces in the upper, middle, and lower panels are separated by 1-min applications of 1 mm DTT. B, summary of changes in MTSET reaction rate associated with the three experimental conditions as depicted in A. All reaction rates are normalized to the value recorded in the presence of EC10 glycine. Data for S273C were averaged from 3 cells, and a Student's paired t test reveals a significant difference between the EC10 glycine reaction rate and the EC30 glycine + 5mm PTX reaction rate (p < 0.05). Statistical significance is denoted by the asterisk. A similar analysis was performed on all other mutants and the mean results are displayed for A272C (n = 4 cells), L274C (n = 4 cells), and P275C (n = 5 cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We used a similar protocol to examine the effect of PTX on MTSET reaction rates with the R271C, A272C, L274C, P275C, and K276C mutant GlyRs. In the A272C and L274C mutant GlyRs, PTX + EC30 glycine also caused a significant reduction in the reaction rate relative to that seen in the presence of EC10 glycine alone (Fig. 2B). However, in the P275C GlyR, the reaction rate in PTX + EC30 glycine was not significantly different to that obtained with EC10 glycine (Figs. 2B and 3A). This negative result was confirmed in each of 5 cells, and the averaged results are shown in Fig. 2B. This result is not surprising as the reaction rate differential between the closed state and EC30 glycine-activated state in this mutant is less than 3-fold (9Lynch J.W. Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying that the surface exposure of P275C varies little during gating.FIGURE 3Sample results for P275C and R271C using the protocol as described in the legend to Fig. 2A. A, all data in this panel were recorded from a cell expressing the P275C GlyR. In this cell, glycine was applied at 1 and 3 mm (corresponding to EC10 and EC30), and PTX was applied at 10 μm. Note the apparent lack of effect of glycine concentration and PTX on MTSET reaction rates. Data averaged from 5 cells confirms this (Fig. 2B). B, all data in this panel were recorded from a cell expressing the R271C GlyR. The experimental protocol in the upper 2 panels was the same as in Fig. 2A. In this cell, glycine was applied at 1 and 3 mm, and PTX was applied at 10 μm.Inthe bottom panel, control glycine applications before and after MTSET reveal that MTSET did induce a current increase that became apparent only after PTX washout.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effects of PTX on MTSET reactivity of R271C and K276C could not be measured. As shown in the example in Fig. 3B, an increase in the R271C reaction rate was observed as the glycine concentration was increased from EC10 to EC30. Surprisingly, however, PTX abolished the change in current that otherwise occurs upon the addition of MTSET to these mutants (Fig. 3B, bottom trace). A similar lack of effect was observed in each of 4 cells expressing the R271C GlyR and in 4 cells expressing the K276C GlyR. There are 2 likely explanations for this. One is that MTSET cannot reach its reaction site in the presence of PTX and the other is that MTSET modification caused an increase in PTX sensitivity, so that the enhanced PTX inhibition exactly cancelled out the MTSET-induced current increase. If both MTSET and PTX are removed following simultaneous exposure, the magnitude of the glycine-activated current increases to the same value as seen following exposure to MTSET in the absence of PTX (Fig. 3B, compare center and bottom traces). This indicates that MTSET modification has taken place and that MTSET modification must therefore cause an increased PTX sensitivity in the R271C GlyR. This was tested directly by measuring the degree of inhibition induced by 10 μm PTX on currents activated by 3 mm glycine both before and after MTSET modification. Before MTSET, PTX inhibited currents to 51 ± 3% of control, but in the same 4 cells after MTSET modification, it inhibited currents to 28 ± 7% of control. This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05) using a paired t test. A similar experiment performed on the K276C GlyR yielded a similar result. A 10 mm PTX concentration inhibited currents activated by 5 mm glycine to a level of 35 ± 6% before MTSET modification and to 10 ± 3% after modification. Again, this difference was statistically significant using a paired t test (n = 4 cells, p < 0.05). Hence, it is concluded that the lack of current change upon simultaneous application of MTSET + PTX can be attributed to an MTSET-induced increase in PTX sensitivity.The conclusion thus far is that PTX reduces the reaction rate of MTSET with A272C, S273C, and L274C. There are 3 possible ways by which this could be achieved. The first is that PTX and MTSET may form a complex in free solution. This possibility was eliminated by showing that the PTX IC50 for the WT GlyR was not significantly affected by the presence of 1 mm MTSET (not shown). The second possibility is that PTX changes the conformation of this domain via an allosteric action. The third is that PTX binds to either this domain or a nearby domain and sterically interferes with the MTSET reaction. To discriminate between these two possibilities, it is essential to identify the location of the PTX binding site.PTX Interactions with the Pore—During the course of the above experiments, we noticed that recovery from PTX inhibition required the R271C GlyR to be activated by glycine. This effect is characterized formally in Fig. 4. Fig. 4A shows a control in which 2 applications of an EC50 (3 mm) concentration of glycine spaced ∼60 s apart are similar in magnitude. Fig. 4B shows the slow recovery that follows the complete inhibition of this current by a saturating (300 μm) concentration of PTX. If both glycine and PTX are simultaneously removed when the current is inhibited, it is apparent that recovery from PTX inhibition commences only when glycine is applied 60 s later (Fig. 4C). Thus, PTX is “trapped” in the absence of glycine. As shown in the inset, overlay of the PTX inhibition recovery phases recorded in Fig. 4, B and C, reveal identical time courses of recovery. When PTX is applied in the closed state (Fig. 4D), a subsequent application of glycine indicates that PTX cannot efficiently access its inhibitory site. Identical experiments to these were performed in each of 5 cells, and the results are summarized in Fig. 4, E and F. Fig. 4E shows the percentage of original current that was observed 65 s after the initial glycine current was terminated for the four experimental conditions depicted in Fig. 4, A–D. The 0- and 65-s time points are indicated by the vertical dashed line. Fig. 3E reveals that the only condition that causes a significant decrease in glycine current at the 65-s time point is when PTX is trapped for 60 s in the closed state. Fig. 3F measures the ratio of currents from 5 cells measured at 1-s intervals during the recovery from PTX inhibition following trap relative to the current recorded at the same recovery time point without trap. As there is no substantial deviation from 1 at any point, we conclude that the recovery rate following the 60-s trap is no different from its recovery rate without trap. We also observed PTX trap in the MTSET-modified R271C GlyR and the K276C GlyR (n = 3 for each, data not shown), but not in any other mutant GlyR tested in this study.FIGURE 4PTX trap in the R271C GlyR. A, all data in A–D were from the same cell. Glycine was applied throughout at 3 mm and PTX at 300 μm. Panel A shows 2 control glycine applications spaced 60 s apart. B, glycine was applied as shown by the unfilled bar, and PTX was applied as indicated by the filled bar. Note the slow recovery from PTX inhibition. C, similar experiment to B except that glycine and PTX were simultaneously removed once PTX inhibition reached steady-state. Glycine was reapplied ∼60 s later revealing the PTX trap. The inset shows the overlaid recovery current time courses from panels B and C. D, PTX applied in the closed state does not cause significant trap. E, the mean current amplitude at the 65-s time point is expressed as a percentage of the control current magnitude for the four experimental conditions depicted in panels A–D. The 0- and 65-s time points are shown by the vertical dashed lines. All experiments were averaged from 5 cells, and only experiment B caused a significant (p < 0.05) current decrease at 65 s. This measure indicates that the results summarized in A–D were typical of those obtained in all cells tested. F, the magnitude of the current at 1-s intervals during recovery from trap is expressed as a ratio of the current at the corresponding time point during recovery without trap. All points are averaged from 5 cells. The plot reveals no significant difference in their respective recovery time courses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PTX has long been"

To date, it has been the linker sequence between the R subunit dimerization/docking domain and cAMP-binding domain A that has been implicated in modulating domain interactions to give rise to these differences in global structure. The small angle solution scattering data presented here for three different isoforms of PKA heterodimer (ΔR-C) complexes reveal a role for another conformationally dynamic sequence in modulating inter-subunit and domain interactions, the C helix that connects the cAMP-binding domains A and B of the R subunit. The ΔR-C heterodimer complexes studied here were each formed with a monomeric N-terminal deletion mutant of the R subunit (ΔR) that contains the inhibitor sequence and both cAMP-binding domains. The scattering data show that type IIα and type IIβ ΔR-C heterodimers are relatively compact and globular, with the C subunit contacting the inhibitor sequence and both cAMP-binding domains. In contrast, the type Iα heterodimer is significantly more extended, with the C subunit interacting with the inhibitor sequence and cAMP-binding domain A, whereas domain B extends out such that its surface is almost completely solvent exposed. These data implicate the C helix of RIα in modulating isoform-specific interdomain communication in the PKA holoenzyme, adding another layer of structural complexity to our understanding of signaling dynamics in this multisubunit, multidomain protein kinase.

Mutations in PKA can lead to diseases such as Carney complex (3Kirschner L.S. Carney J.A. Pack S.D. Taymans S.E. Giatzakis C. Cho Y.S. Cho-Chung Y.S. Stratakis C.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) and lupus erythematosus (4Laxminarayana D. Kammer G.M. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), underscoring the importance of its role in signaling processes and disease states. Unlike many protein kinases, the catalytic and regulatory functions of PKA are on separate polypeptide chains. The catalytic (C) subunits are responsible for catalyzing phosphoryl transfer, whereas the regulatory (R) subunits confer cAMP dependence and localize the holoenzyme to discrete subcellular locations via interactions with protein kinase A anchoring proteins (5Wong W. Scott J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). At low intracellular cAMP concentrations, PKA is maintained as an inactive tetrameric holoenzyme complex (R2C2) consisting of a homodimeric R2 subunit and two C subunits. When intracellular concentrations of cAMP are increased in response to specific stimuli, two cAMP molecules bind allosterically to each R subunit, which releases inhibition of the C subunits and allows them to phosphorylate their protein targets. protein kinase A (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) catalytic subunit of PKA dimerization/docking domain maximum linear dimension hyrogen/deuterium 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid regulatory subunit of PKA radius of gyration. protein kinase A (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) catalytic subunit of PKA dimerization/docking domain maximum linear dimension hyrogen/deuterium 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid regulatory subunit of PKA radius of gyration. There are four major isoforms of PKA that differ with respect to their R subunits (RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ). These isoforms have different biological functions, as determined by genetic studies using mice (6Amieux P.S. McKnight G.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 968: 75-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7Cummings D.E. Brandon E.P. Planas J.V. Motamed K. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Nature. 1996; 382: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Despite their different cellular functions, the different R isoforms share the same domain organization within their sequences: starting from the N terminus is a dimerization/docking (D/D) domain that also anchors the R subunits to PKA anchoring proteins, a linker region that contains an inhibitor sequence, and two tandem cAMP-binding domains (designated A and B). There is high sequence homology between all the isoforms in the D/D domain and the cAMP-binding domains (8Canaves J.M. Taylor S.S. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), but the linker regions are highly variable in both length and sequence (9Vigil D. Blumenthal D.K. Heller W.T. Brown S. Canaves J.M.

Biol. 2003; 330: 1117-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) provide important molecular insights into the phosphoryl transfer reaction, cAMP binding, and tethering of the R subunits to specific cellular locations. To date, full-length holoenzyme or R2 homodimer crystal structures for PKA have been elusive. Small angle x-ray scattering studies have shown that both full-length RIIα and RIIβ homodimers are highly extended structures in solution, whereas the RIα homodimer is much more compact, having a Y-like shape (9Vigil D. Blumenthal D.K. Heller W.T. Brown S. Canaves J.M. Taylor S.S. Trewhella J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Likewise, the shape of the full-length type IIα holoenzyme is much more elongated than the type Iα (15Heller W.T. Vigil D. Brown S. Blumenthal D.K. Taylor S.S. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19084-19090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These shape differences have been attributed to structural differences in the linkers between type I and type II isoforms that lead to different spatial organizations of domains (9Vigil D. Blumenthal D.K. Heller W.T. Brown S. Canaves J.M. Taylor S.S. Trewhella J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The results reported here further explore the conformational diversity of R subunit isoforms using small angle solution scattering to study N-terminal-truncated monomeric versions of RIα, RIIα, and RIIβ that contain the inhibitor sequence and both cAMP-binding domains (A and B) in heterodimeric complexes with the C subunit. Previous small angle scattering studies of a type IIα R-C heterodimer (16Zhao J. Hoye E. Boylan S. Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30448-30459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) support structural models in which both the A and B cAMP-binding domains of RIIα interact with C, leading to a compact overall structure (17Tung C.S.

However, hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (18Anand G.S. Law D. Mandell J.G. Snead A.N. Tsigelny I. Taylor S.S. Ten Eyck L.F. Komives E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Law, private communications. predict different R-C interfaces for RIα versus RIIβ. The first crystal structure showing an R-C interaction was recently obtained for a complex of the C subunit with a deletion mutant of RIα that includes just the pseudo-substrate inhibitor region and cAMP-binding domain A (22Kim C. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Science. 2005; 307: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This structure shows an interaction with the inhibitor site of RIα bound to the active site of C as well as with the helical region of cAMP-binding domain A bound to the surface of the large (C-terminal) lobe of C. Compared with the crystal structures of the free R subunit (11Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. (1995) Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 12Diller T.C. Xuong N.H. Madhusudan Taylor S.S. Structure. 2001; 9: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), there are significant conformational rearrangements within RIα upon binding C. In particular, the C helix in the A domain of RIα, which connects the cAMP binding A and B domains, swings away from the β-barrel and the phosphate binding cassette, suggesting that the interface between the two cAMP-binding domains may be altered upon C subunit binding. The results reported here show that there is indeed a dramatic conformational change in the disposition of the cAMP-binding domains of RIα upon C subunit binding and that there are significant isoform differences in the cAMP-binding domain and C subunit interactions in the heterodimeric complexes studied. Protein Expression and Purification—Bovine RIα (residues 92–379), rat RIIα (residues 92–400), and RIIβ (residues 104–408) deletion mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli 222 cells and affinity purified on cAMP-Sepharose resin as described previously (9Vigil D. Blumenthal D.K. Heller W.T. Brown S. Canaves J.M. Taylor S.S. Trewhella J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recombinant bovine catalytic (C) subunit was expressed in E. coli and purified as previously described (23Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20940-20946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). R-C heterodimers were formed by mixing purified R subunit deletion mutants with a molar excess of purified C subunit and dialyzing against buffer containing 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm ATP. These conditions approximate physiological ionic strength and concentrations of Mg2+/ATP for most tissues. Gel filtration (Superdex 75) was then used to separate heterodimer complexes from free C subunit, the running buffer being identical to the buffer used for dialysis. Heterodimer activation by cAMP was checked with a coupled kinase assay to confirm that C subunit was inhibited in a cAMP-dependent manner (24Cook P.F. Neville Jr., M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski Jr., R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The substrate peptide, Kemptide, with the sequence LRRASLG was synthesized by the Microchemical Facility of the University of California, Berkeley. Amino Acid Analysis—Amino acid composition of the type Iα heterodimer (Sample 3) was quantified after hydrolysis in 5.7 N HCl containing 0.1% phenol in vacuo at 110 °C. The analysis was performed on a Beckman 6300 analyzer. The reliably quantified amino acids (Ala, Arg, Asx (Asn+Asp), Glx (Gln+Glu), Ile, Leu, Lys, Phe, and Val) were used to estimate protein concentration of samples analyzed by small angle scattering. The amino acid analysis was performed by Dr. Dennis Winge, University of Utah. Small Angle X-ray Scattering Measurements—X-ray scattering data were collected using the line source instrument described by Heidorn and Trewhella (25Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) that is now at the University of Utah. Intensity data were reduced to I(q) versus q using standard procedures to correct for detector sensitivity and background signal. A smearing procedure was used to correct for the slit geometry of the instrument when comparing predicted scattering of structural models to the experimental scattering data (25Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). I(q) is the scattered x-ray intensity per unit solid angle, and q is the amplitude of the scattering vector and is given by 4π(sinθ)/λ (where 2θ is the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength of scattered x-rays, which is 1.54 Å for this instrument). The net scattering from the protein was calculated by subtracting a normalized buffer spectrum. The buffer blank was identical to the buffer in the protein samples as it was obtained from protein-free gel filtration fractions collected during purification of the corresponding R-C complex. For each sample, three different protein concentrations were measured (ranging from ∼1–1.5 to ∼5–10 mg/ml). There are no concentration-dependent effects in the scattering; i.e. the Rg, Dmax, and P(r) functions remain unchanged within experimental error. Because the signal/noise ratio is the best for the highest concentration samples, the data from these samples were used for analysis. Sample and buffer measurements took between 12 and 24 h, and the samples were kept at 13 °C during the measurements. Small Angle X-ray Scattering Data Analysis—Structural information was derived from the scattering data by calculating the inverse Fourier transform of I(q), which yields P(r), the probable distribution of vector lengths, r, between scattering centers (atoms) within the scattering particles (calculated using the program GNOM) (26Svergun D.I. Semenyuk A.V. Feigin L.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1988; 44: 244-250Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). P(r) thus provides insights into the overall shape of the scattering molecule. P(r) goes to zero at the maximum linear dimension, Dmax, of the scattering particle, and its zeroth and second moments give the forward scattering, I(0), and radius of gyration, Rg, values, respectively. Guinier (27Guinier A. Ann. Phys. 1939; 12: 166-237Google Scholar) plots (q2 versus lnI(q) for Q·Rg <1.3) show the expected straight line fit for monodisperse identical scattering particles. Structural Models—Simulated scattering profiles for the type IIα model (17Tung C.S. Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12423-12431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank accession number 1KMW) and H/D exchange/docking type IIβ model 5J. Gullingsrud, private communications. were generated using CRYSOL with standard parameters, including the standard solvation layer thickness and contrast (28Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crysallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2685) Google Scholar). Different arrangements of the B domain with respect to the A domain and C subunit for the type Iα heterodimer were generated using the program CONTRAST. CONTRAST (29Heller W.T. Abusamhadneh E. Finley N. Rosevear P.R. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15654-15663Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) can take a set of known high resolution structures as well as shapes of uniform scattering density and find the relative position and orientation of these components that give the best fit to a set of experimental scattering profiles. The best-fit model structures are generated using a Monte Carlo approach employed previously (16Zhao J. Hoye E. Boylan S. Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30448-30459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). CONTRAST uses the fitting parameter F defined in Equation 1 to evaluate the quality of the fit of each model to the data.F=1Npts(∑Npts(I(q)-Im(q))2σ(q)2)(Eq. 1) Npts is the number of points in the data set, I(q) and Im(q) are the experimental and model intensities, respectively, and σ(q) is the experimental uncertainty of I(q). We defined two high resolution components for the CONTRAST calculations, the crystal structure of C bound to residues 94–244 of RIα (C/A domain) (Protein Data Bank accession number 1U7E) and residues 245–376 of the isolated, cAMP-free RIα B domain (Protein Data Bank accession number 1RL3). The individual structures were connected through residues Tyr243 and Glu244 and allowed to rotate randomly with respect to each other about this pivot point. The selection of this pivot point was based upon observations of the final snapshot of a molecular dynamics simulation performed to discover possible energetically feasible placements of the B domain within the heterodimer 5J. Gullingsrud, private communications.. Because the small angle scattering data are inherently low resolution and only sensitive to overall distributions of molecular mass rather than the locations of specific amino acids, the precise choice for the pivot point within the C helix, as well as the details of the atomic structure in this region, are somewhat arbitrary for the purposes of this study. To find the model that best fit the scattering data, the angles for the bonds about the selected pivot point were assigned randomly with the only constraint being that no van der Waals overlap between the two rigid bodies was allowed. In this manner the B domain of R could be placed in random locations with respect to the domain A/C subunit component while keeping the distance between them consistent with that required by the sequence connectivity and also avoiding component overlap. Four independent runs of CONTRAST were performed, each testing in excess of 100,000 possible models. The molecular volumes of the atomic models for type Iα and type IIα and IIβ heterodimers were calculated using the Porod invariant (30Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, New York1982: 18-50Google Scholar) and simulated scattering profiles generated by CRYSOL (28Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crysallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2685) Google Scholar). Low resolution ab initio shapes that fit the scattering data were generated using the program DAMMIN (31Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar) for each heterodimer isoform. This program constructs arbitrary shapes using assemblies of dummy atoms and tests them against experimental scattering intensity profiles. No symmetry constraints were applied, and the initial shape tested in each DAMMIN run was a sphere with radius equal to Dmax (TABLE ONE). The default parameters were used in each calculation, including a packing radius of dummy atom beads of 3.2 Å for type Iα and 2.5 Å for type IIα and type IIβ. For the more complex-shaped RIα models, 10 independent models were aligned and averaged using the program DAMAVER with default parameters (32Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). The program DAMFILT (32Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1577) Google Scholar) was then used to filter the models based on occupancy, with the mean volume of the constituent runs set as the cutoff to produce the average or most probable model (Fig. 4A). The Cα coordinates of the previously developed type IIα heterodimer model (Protein Data Bank accession number 1KMW) were superimposed with the type IIα heterodimer DAMMIN model, and the Cα coordinates of the DAMAVER/DAMFILT type Iα heterodimer model were superimposed with the CONTRAST model using the program SUPCOMB (33Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). The molecular volumes for the DAMMIN models were calculated using the Porod invariant (30Porod G. Glatter O.

The Guinier plots for each isoform are all linear, as expected for a monodisperse solution of identical particles (Fig. 3), and the volumes of the scattering particles, calculated from the scattering data using the Porod invariant (TABLE ONE), are as predicted from the molecular weight of each heterodimer complex. In combination, these results are good evidence that we have monodisperse protein solutions suitable for analysis of structural parameters from the scattering data.FIGURE 2Intensity profiles and P(r) functions for the type Iα PKA heterodimer. A, I(q) versus q for three independent preparations of the type Iα heterodimer. The solid line through the data sets is the simulated scattering profile of the best-fit CONTRAST model (Fig. 5B). Top, middle, and bottom rows correspond to Samples 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For clarity, only every other data point is plotted. B, P(r) functions of the scattering profiles shown in panel A and from which the structural parameters in TABLE ONE are calculated. Symbols are the same as in panel A. Areas under the P(r) curves are normalized to those in Fig. 1 according to the average molecular weight squared of the scattering particles. Errors are based on counting statistics and are smaller than the symbols if not shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Guinier plots of the scattering data for each heterodimer.

Unlike the type II isoforms, the type Iα isoform shows small variations in the scattering data from different protein preparations. We pursued some additional analyses to see whether we could determine the source of this variability. A reducing SDS-PAGE gel of the RIα heterodimer showed no detectable protein contaminants, and band staining intensities were consistent with an ∼1:1 stoichiometry of R and C (not shown). Quantitative amino acid analysis of the same sample gave a possible range of R:C stoichiometries from 1:1 to 1.2:1. Thus, the sample variability giving rise to the small differences in the P(r) functions appears to be inherent to the RIα-C heterodimer complex and may reflect small variations in the global structure of the reconstituted complex in different preparations. From simple inspection of the P(r) profiles in Figs. 1 and 2 it is evident that the"
