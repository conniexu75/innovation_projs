https://openalex.org/W2511616479,"Tight junction (TJ) dysfunction in the stratum granulosum leads to aberrant barrier function of the stratum corneum (SC) in the epidermis. However, it is unclear whether TJs are perturbed in atopic dermatitis (AD), a representative aberrant SC-related skin disease, and whether some factors related to AD pathogenesis induce TJ dysfunction. To address these issues, we investigated the alterations of TJs in AD skin and the effects of Th2 and Th17 cytokines on TJs in a skin-equivalent model. The levels of TJ proteins were determined in the epidermis of nonlesional and lesional skin sites of AD. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the levels of zonula occludens 1 were decreased in the nonlesional sites of AD, and the levels of zonula occludens 1 and claudin-1 were decreased in the lesional sites relative to the levels in skin from healthy subjects. Next, we examined the effects of interleukin (IL)-4, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-17, and IL-22 on the TJ barrier in a skin-equivalent model. Only IL-17 impaired the TJ barrier. Furthermore, we observed a defect in filaggrin monomer degradation in the IL-17–treated skin model. Thus, TJs are dysfunctional in AD, at least partly, due to the effect of IL-17, which may result in an aberrant SC barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2517008134,"The aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) into amyloid fibrils is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, collectively referred to as the α-synucleinopathies. In vivo, molecular chaperones, such as the small heat-shock proteins (sHsps), normally act to prevent protein aggregation; however, it remains to be determined how aggregation-prone α-syn evades sHsp chaperone action leading to its disease-associated deposition. This work examines the molecular mechanism by which two canonical sHsps, αB-crystallin (αB-c) and Hsp27, interact with aggregation-prone α-syn to prevent its aggregation in vitro. Both sHsps are very effective inhibitors of α-syn aggregation, but no stable complex between the sHsps and α-syn was detected, indicating that the sHsps inhibit α-syn aggregation via transient interactions. Moreover, the ability of these sHsps to prevent α-syn aggregation was dependent on the kinetics of aggregation; the faster the rate of aggregation (shorter the lag phase), the less effective the sHsps were at inhibiting fibril formation of α-syn. Thus, these findings indicate that the rate at which α-syn aggregates in cells may be a significant factor in how it evades sHsp chaperone action in the α-synucleinopathies."

Methods This 188-week open-label extension of the dose-escalation study assessed the long-term efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of drisapersen (PRO051/GSK2402968), 6 mg/kg subcutaneously, in 12 DMD subjects. Dosing was once weekly for 72 weeks. All subjects had a planned treatment interruption (weeks 73–80), followed by intermittent dosing (weeks 81–188). Results Subjects received a median (range) total dose of 5.93 (5.10 to 6.02) mg/kg drisapersen. After 177 weeks (last efficacy assessment), median (mean [SD]) six-minute walk distance (6MWD) improved by 8 (-24.5 [161]) meters for the 10 subjects able to complete the 6MWD at baseline (mean age [SD]: 9.5 [1.9] years). These statistics include 2 subjects unable to complete the test at later visits and who scored “zero”. When only the 8 ambulant subjects at week 177 were taken into account, a median (mean [SD]) increase of 64 (33 [121]) meters in 6MWD was observed. Of 7 subjects walking ≥330 m at extension baseline, 5 walked farther at week 177. Of 3 subjects walking <330 m, 2 lost ambulation, while 1 declined overall but walked farther at some visits. Over the 188 weeks, the most common adverse events were injection-site reactions, raised urinary α1-microglobulin and proteinuria. Dystrophin expression was detected in all muscle biopsies obtained at week 68 or 72. Conclusion Drisapersen was generally well tolerated over 188 weeks. Possible renal effects, thrombocytopenia and injection-site reactions warrant continued monitoring. Improvements in the 6MWD at 12 weeks were sustained after 3.4 years of dosing for most patients. For a small, uncontrolled study, the outcomes are encouraging, as natural history studies would anticipate a decline of over 100 meters over a 3-year period in a comparable cohort.

https://openalex.org/W2512158376,"The cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) represent a large and important enzyme superfamily in plants. They catalyze numerous monooxygenation/hydroxylation reactions in biochemical pathways, P450s are involved in a variety of metabolic pathways and participate in the homeostasis of phytohormones. The CYP82 family genes specifically reside in dicots and are usually induced by distinct environmental stresses. However, their functions are largely unknown, especially in soybean (Glycine max L.). Here, we report the function of GmCYP82A3, a gene from soybean CYP82 family. Its expression was induced by Phytophthora sojae infection, salinity and drought stresses, and treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or ethephon (ETH). Its expression levels were consistently high in resistant cultivars. Transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants overexpressing GmCYP82A3 exhibited strong resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Phytophthora parasitica, and enhanced tolerance to salinity and drought stresses. Furthermore, transgenic plants were less sensitive to jasmonic acid (JA), and the enhanced resistance was accompanied with increased expression of the JA/ET signaling pathway-related genes."
https://openalex.org/W2515696031,"In systems biology, one of the major tasks is to tailor model complexity to information content of the data. A useful model should describe the data and produce well-determined parameter estimates and predictions. Too small of a model will not be able to describe the data whereas a model which is too large tends to overfit measurement errors and does not provide precise predictions. Typically, the model is modified and tuned to fit the data, which often results in an oversized model. To restore the balance between model complexity and available measurements, either new data has to be gathered or the model has to be reduced. In this manuscript, we present a data-based method for reducing non-linear models. The profile likelihood is utilised to assess parameter identifiability and designate likely candidates for reduction. Parameter dependencies are analysed along profiles, providing context-dependent suggestions for the type of reduction. We discriminate four distinct scenarios, each associated with a specific model reduction strategy. Iterating the presented procedure eventually results in an identifiable model, which is capable of generating precise and testable predictions. Source code for all toy examples is provided within the freely available, open-source modelling environment Data2Dynamics based on MATLAB available at http://www.data2dynamics.org/, as well as the R packages dMod/cOde available at https://github.com/dkaschek/. Moreover, the concept is generally applicable and can readily be used with any software capable of calculating the profile likelihood."
https://openalex.org/W2517658601,"SPX domains control phosphate homeostasis in eukaryotes. Ten genes in yeast encode SPX-containing proteins, among which YDR089W is the only one of unknown function. Here, we show that YDR089W encodes a novel subunit of the vacuole transporter chaperone (VTC) complex that produces inorganic polyphosphate (polyP). The polyP synthesis transfers inorganic phosphate (Pi) from the cytosol into the acidocalcisome- and lysosome-related vacuoles of yeast, where it can be released again. It was therefore proposed for buffer changes in cytosolic Pi concentration (Thomas, M. R., and O'Shea, E. K. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 102, 9565–9570). Vtc5 physically interacts with the VTC complex and accelerates the accumulation of polyP synthesized by it. Deletion of VTC5 reduces polyP accumulation in vivo and in vitro. Its overexpression hyperactivates polyP production and triggers the phosphate starvation response via the PHO pathway. Because this Vtc5-induced starvation response can be reverted by shutting down polyP synthesis genetically or pharmacologically, we propose that polyP synthesis rather than Vtc5 itself is a regulator of the PHO pathway. Our observations suggest that polyP synthesis not only serves to establish a buffer for transient drops in cytosolic Pi levels but that it can actively decrease or increase the steady state of cytosolic Pi."
https://openalex.org/W2507363236,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) coordinates cell growth with its nutritional, hormonal, energy, and stress status. Amino acids are critical regulators of mTORC1 that permit other inputs to mTORC1 activity. However, the roles of individual amino acids and their interactions in mTORC1 activation are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that activation of mTORC1 by amino acids includes two discrete and separable steps: priming and activation. Sensitizing mTORC1 activation by priming amino acids is a prerequisite for subsequent stimulation of mTORC1 by activating amino acids. Priming is achieved by a group of amino acids that includes l-asparagine, l-glutamine, l-threonine, l-arginine, l-glycine, l-proline, l-serine, l-alanine, and l-glutamic acid. The group of activating amino acids is dominated by l-leucine but also includes l-methionine, l-isoleucine, and l-valine. l-Cysteine predominantly inhibits priming but not the activating step. Priming and activating steps differ in their requirements for amino acid concentration and duration of treatment. Priming and activating amino acids use mechanisms that are distinct both from each other and from growth factor signaling. Neither step requires intact tuberous sclerosis complex of proteins to activate mTORC1. Concerted action of priming and activating amino acids is required to localize mTORC1 to lysosomes and achieve its activation."
https://openalex.org/W2509715247,"Orai1 is a transmembrane protein that forms homomeric, calcium-selective channels activated by stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) after depletion of intracellular calcium stores. In adult skeletal muscle, depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium activates STIM1/Orai1-dependent store-operated calcium entry. Here, we used constitutive and inducible muscle-specific Orai1-knockout (KO) mice to determine the acute and long-term developmental effects of Orai1 ablation on muscle structure and function. Skeletal muscles from constitutive, muscle-specific Orai-KO mice exhibited normal postnatal growth and fiber type differentiation. However, a significant reduction in fiber cross-sectional area occurred by 3 mo of age, with the most profound reduction observed in oxidative, fatigue-resistant fiber types. Soleus muscles of constitutive Orai-KO mice exhibited a reduction in unique type I fibers, concomitant with an increase in hybrid fibers expressing both type I and type IIA myosins. Additionally, ex vivo force measurements showed reduced maximal specific force and in vivo exercise assays revealed reduced endurance in constitutive muscle-specific Orai-KO mice. Using tamoxifen-inducible, muscle-specific Orai-KO mice, these functional deficits were found to be the result of the delayed fiber changes resulting from an early developmental loss of Orai1 and not the result of an acute loss of Orai1-dependent store-operated calcium entry.-Carrell, E. M., Coppola, A. R., McBride, H. J., Dirksen, R. T. Orai1 enhances muscle endurance by promoting fatigue-resistant type I fiber content but not through acute store-operated Ca2+ entry."
https://openalex.org/W2509360153,"Understanding of the processes affecting recruitment of commercially important fish species is one of the major challenges in fisheries science. Towards this aim, we investigated the relation between North Sea hydrography (temperature and salinity) and fish stock variables (recruitment, spawning stock biomass and pre-recruitment survival index) for 9 commercially important fishes using spatially-resolved cross-correlation analysis. We used high-resolution (0.2° × 0.2°) hydrographic data fields matching the maximal temporal extent of the fish population assessments (1948–2013). Our approach allowed for the identification of regions in the North Sea where environmental variables seem to be more influential on the fish stocks, as well as the regions of a lesser or nil influence. Our results confirmed previously demonstrated negative correlations between temperature and recruitment of cod and plaice and identified regions of the strongest correlations (German Bight for plaice and north-western North Sea for cod). We also revealed a positive correlation between herring spawning stock biomass and temperature in the Orkney-Shetland area, as well as a negative correlation between sole pre-recruitment survival index and temperature in the German Bight. A strong positive correlation between sprat stock variables and salinity in the central North Sea was also found. To our knowledge the results concerning correlations between North Sea hydrography and stocks’ dynamics of herring, sole and sprat are novel. The new information about spatial distribution of the correlation provides an additional help to identify mechanisms underlying these correlations. As an illustration of the utility of these results for fishery management, an example is provided that incorporates the identified environmental covariates in stock-recruitment models."
https://openalex.org/W2514275558,"Reversible glutathionylation plays a critical role in protecting protein function under conditions of oxidative stress generally and for endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) specifically. Glutathione-dependent glutaredoxin-mediated deglutathionylation of eNOS has been shown to confer protection in a model of heart damage termed ischemia-reperfusion injury, motivating further study of eNOS deglutathionylation in general. In this report, we present evidence for an alternative mechanism of deglutathionylation. In this pathway thioredoxin (Trx), a small cellular redox protein, is shown to rescue eNOS from glutathionylation during ischemia-reperfusion in a GSH-independent manner. By comparing mice with global overexpression of Trx and mice with cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of Trx, we demonstrate that vascular Trx-mediated deglutathionylation of eNOS protects against ischemia-reperfusion-mediated myocardial infarction. Trx deficiency in endothelial cells promoted eNOS glutathionylation and reduced its enzymatic activity, whereas increased levels of Trx led to deglutathionylated eNOS. Thioredoxin-mediated deglutathionylation of eNOS in the coronary artery in vivo protected against reperfusion injury, even in the presence of normal levels of GSH. We further show that Trx directly interacts with eNOS, and we confirmed that Cys-691 and Cys-910 are the glutathionylated sites, as mutation of these cysteines partially rescued the decrease in eNOS activity, whereas mutation of a distal site, Cys-384, did not. Collectively, this study shows for the first time that Trx is a potent deglutathionylating protein in vivo and in vitro that can deglutathionylate proteins in the presence of high levels of GSSG in conditions of oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2515561393,"The G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family represents the largest and most varied collection of membrane embedded proteins that are sensitized by ligand binding and interact with heterotrimeric G proteins. Despite their presumed critical roles in fungal biology, the functions of the GPCR family members in the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus are largely unknown, as only two (GprC and GprD) of the 15 predicted GPCRs have been studied. Here, we characterize the gprK gene, which is predicted to encode a hybrid GPCR with both 7-transmembrane and regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) domains. The deletion of gprK causes severely impaired asexual development coupled with reduced expression of key developmental activators. Moreover, ΔgprK results in hyper-activation of germination even in the absence of carbon source, and elevated expression and activity of the protein kinase A PkaC1. Furthermore, proliferation of the ΔgprK mutant is restricted on the medium when pentose is the sole carbon source, suggesting that GprK may function in external carbon source sensing. Notably, the absence of gprK results in reduced tolerance to oxidative stress and significantly lowered mRNA levels of the stress-response associated genes sakA and atfA. Activities of catalases and SODs are severely decreased in the ΔgprK mutant, indicating that GprK may function in proper activation of general stress response. The ΔgprK mutant is also defective in gliotoxin (GT) production and slightly less virulent toward the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella. Transcriptomic studies reveal that a majority of transporters are down-regulated by ΔgprK. In summary, GprK is necessary for proper development, GT production, and oxidative stress response, and functions in down-regulating the PKA-germination pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2514041770,"Background and Objectives Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine. The dysregulation of IL-10 is associated with an enhanced immunopathologic response to infection, as well as with an increased risk for developing numerous autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated IL-10 expression in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and assessed the possible role of IL-10 in the pathogenesis of CRSwNP. Materials and Methods Thirty-five patients with CRSwNP, 12 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without NP (CRSsNP) and 10 control subjects were enrolled in this study. NP tissues and uncinated tissues (UT) were collected for analysis. Dispersed NP cells (DNPCs) were cultured in the presence or absence of IL-25 and IL-10, and a flow cytometric assay was performed to identify the constitutive cell populations of the DNPCs. Murine NP (n = 18) models were used for the in vivo experiments. Real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, western blotting analysis and ELISA were performed to measure the expression levels of the selected inflammatory cytokines and inflammation-associated molecules. Results The mRNA expression levels of IL-10, IL-5, IL-17A, IL-25 and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) were significantly higher in the NP tissues than in the UT tissues. Strong positive correlations were observed between IL-10 and a variety of inflammatory cytokines (IL-5, IL-17A, IL-25, IFN-γ) and inflammation-associated molecules (B-cell activating factor; BAFF, CD19). Other than the IL-25 to IL-10 ratio, the expression ratios of the other measured inflammatory cytokines to IL-10 were significantly lower in the CRSwNP group than in the CRSsNP or control groups. Administrating IL-25 into the cultured DNPCs significantly increased the production of IL-10, but administrating IL-10 had no effect on the production of IL-25. Conclusion Increased expression of IL-10, IL-10 related inflammatory cytokine, and IL-10 related B cell activation indicated that IL-10, a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of CRSwNPs."
https://openalex.org/W2510207105,"Background Cumulative exposure to lead is associated with cardiovascular outcomes. Polymorphisms in the δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), hemochromatosis (HFE), heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), vitamin D receptor (VDR), glutathione S-transferase (GST) supergene family (GSTP1, GSTT1, GSTM1), apolipoprotein E (APOE),angiotensin II receptor-1 (AGTR1) and angiotensinogen (AGT) genes, are believed to alter toxicokinetics and/or toxicodynamics of lead. Objectives We assessed possible effect modification by genetic polymorphisms in ALAD, HFE, HMOX1, VDR, GSTP1, GSTT1, GSTM1, APOE, AGTR1 and AGT individually and as the genetic risk score (GRS) on the association between cumulative lead exposure and incident coronary heart disease (CHD) events. Methods We used K-shell-X-ray fluorescence to measure bone lead levels. GRS was calculated on the basis of 22 lead-related loci. We constructed Cox proportional hazard models to compute adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident CHD. We applied inverse probability weighting to account for potential selection bias due to recruitment into the bone lead sub-study. Results Significant effect modification was found by VDR, HMOX1, GSTP1, APOE, and AGT genetic polymorphisms when evaluated individually. Further, the bone lead-CHD associations became larger as GRS increases. After adjusting for potential confounders, a HR of CHD was 2.27 (95%CI: 1.50–3.42) with 2-fold increase in patella lead levels, among participants in the top tertile of GRS. We also detected an increasing trend in HRs across tertiles of GRS (p-trend = 0.0063). Conclusions Our findings suggest that lead-related loci as a whole may play an important role in susceptibility to lead-related CHD risk. These findings need to be validated in a separate cohort containing bone lead, lead-related genetic loci and incident CHD data."

Escherichia coli RecA is an ATP-dependent DNA-binding protein that catalyzes the DNA strand exchange reactions in homologous recombination. RecA assembles into long helical filaments on single-stranded DNA, and these presynaptic complexes are responsible for locating and pairing with a homologous duplex DNA. Recent single molecule studies have provided new insights into RecA behavior, but the potential influence of ATP in the reactions remains poorly understood. Here we examine how ATP influences the ability of the RecA presynaptic complex to interact with homologous dsDNA. We demonstrate that over short time regimes, RecA presynaptic complexes sample heterologous dsDNA similarly in the presence of either ATP or ATPγS, suggesting that initial interactions do not depend on ATP hydrolysis. In addition, RecA stabilizes pairing intermediates in three-base steps, and stepping energetics is seemingly unaltered in the presence of ATP. However, the overall dissociation rate of these paired intermediates with ATP is ∼4-fold higher than with ATPγS. These experiments suggest that ATP plays an unanticipated role in promoting the turnover of captured duplex DNA intermediates as RecA attempts to align homologous sequences during the early stages of recombination.

The online platform, which has been developing for more than a decade, provides a unique insight into coordination behaviour among disaster management agencies and individual actors. We build our study on the analysis of a complete database of user interaction including more than 20,000 users and 11,000 comments spread across approximately 300 disaster events. Controlling for types and severities of the events, location-specific vulnerabilities, and the overall trends, we find that the introduction of new features have led to increases in user activity.

https://openalex.org/W2514942338,"A thorough understanding of the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of β cell proliferation is an important initial step in restoring β cell mass in the diabetic patient. Here, we show that epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR) was significantly up-regulated in the islets of C57BL/6 mice after 50% partial pancreatectomy (PPx), a model for workload-induced β cell proliferation. Specific deletion of EGFR in the β cells of adult mice impaired β cell proliferation at baseline and after 50% PPx, suggesting that the EGFR signaling pathway plays an essential role in adult β cell proliferation. Further analyses showed that β cell-specific depletion of EGFR resulted in impaired expression of cyclin D1 and impaired suppression of p27 after PPx, both of which enhance β cell proliferation. These data highlight the importance of EGFR signaling and its downstream signaling cascade in postnatal β cell growth."

Here we show eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), an abundant granule protein released by activated eosinophils, contributes to characteristic asthma-related phenotypes through oxidative posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins in asthmatic airways through a process called carbamylation. Using a combination of studies we now show EPO uses plasma levels of the pseudohalide thiocyanate (SCN−) as substrate to catalyze protein carbamylation, as monitored by PTM of protein lysine residues into Nϵ-carbamyllysine (homocitrulline), and contributes to the pathophysiological sequelae of eosinophil activation.

Clinical studies similarly revealed significant enrichment in carbamylation of airway proteins recovered from atopic asthmatics versus healthy controls in response to segmental allergen challenge. Protein-bound homocitrulline is shown to be co-localized with EPO within human asthmatic airways.

Thus, leukocytes in general and activated eosinophils in particular, have the potential for inflicting oxidative modifications on proteins and lipids in asthmatic airways via numerous pathways. Both EPO and MPO use the pseudo-halide thiocyante (SCN−) as a preferred co-substrate with H2O2 (28.Arlandson M. Decker T. Roongta V.A. Bonilla L. Mayo K.H. MacPherson J.C. Hazen S.L. Slungaard A.

SCN− in vivo originates primarily from diet and environmental exposure. The normal plasma levels of SCN− typically found in non-smokers range from 20 to 100 μm depending upon dietary intake (30.Olea F. Parras P. Determination of serum levels of dietary thiocyanate.J. Anal. Toxicol. 1992; 16: 258-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas levels in smokers can be substantially higher (31.Husgafvel-Pursiainen K. Sorsa M. Engström K. Einistö P.

By comparison, physiological levels of the cosubstrate H2O2 vary widely with levels in extracellular spaces and in the plasma estimated to range between 1 and 18 μm under typical conditions (34.Lacy F. Kailasam M.T. O'Connor D.T. Schmid-Schönbein G.W. Parmer R.J.

Free radicals in the physiological control of cell function.Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7493) Google Scholar). Under physiological levels of H2O2 and cosubstrates, EPO and MPO utilize SCN− as a preferred substrate to primarily form hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN), a weak oxidant with bacteriostatic activity. Using multinuclear NMR, mass spectrometry, and other analytical approaches, we first reported that in addition to HOSCN, a minor product formed following SCN− oxidation by both MPO and EPO in vitro is cyanate (OCN−), with EPO being more efficient at generating OCN− at plasma levels of halides (i.e. 100 mm Cl−, and 100 μm Br−) and SCN− (28.Arlandson M. Decker T. Roongta V.A. Bonilla L. Mayo K.H. MacPherson J.C. Hazen S.L. Slungaard A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 215-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cyanate is in equilibrium with urea under physiological conditions. In end stage renal disease elevated levels of urea lead to enhanced levels of OCN−, and consequently, marked increases in protein carbamylation (37.Kraus L.M. Kraus Jr., A.P. Tyrosine and N-carbamoyl-tyrosine in end-stage renal disease during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1991; 118: 555-562PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleophilic groups on proteins such as amino, hydroxyl, or thiol groups may become covalently modified with a carbamyl (NH2CO) group upon exposure to the electrophile OCN−, altering protein primary structure, charge and function, often leading to enzymatic loss of function (38.Stark G.R.

The reaction with nucleophilic ϵ-amino groups of lysine residues produces Nϵ-carbamyl-lysine, also known as homocitrulline (HCit) (40.Stark G.R.

Cleavage at cysteine after cyanylation.Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The abundance of lysine compared with alternative susceptible amino acids, and the enhanced nucleophilicity of the ϵ-amino lysine moiety compared with that of alternative targets like arginine or histidine, makes lysine side chains a major target for carbamylation in vivo. In prior studies (43.Wang Z. Nicholls S.J. Rodriguez E.R. Kummu O. Hörkkö S. Barnard J. Reynolds W.F. Topol E.J. DiDonato J.A. Hazen S.L. Protein carbamylation links inflammation, smoking, uremia and atherogenesis.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1176-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) we demonstrated MPO-catalyzed oxidation of SCN− serves as an alternative pathway to uremia for promotion of protein carbamylation in vivo at sites of inflammation and vascular disease. We further showed that carbamylated proteins were themselves pro-inflammatory and triggered T cell activation (44.Mydel P. Wang Z. Brisslert M. Hellvard A. Dahlberg L.E. Hazen S.L. Bokarewa M. Carbamylation-dependent activation of T cells: a novel mechanism in the pathogenesis of autoimmune arthritis.J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 6882-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies by others have shown that either direct OCN− exposure to endothelial cells in culture, or via infusion in vivo, promotes protein carbamylation, is pro-inflammatory and inhibits NO-dependent functions (45.El-Gamal D.

Nichols D.P. Day B.J. Nebulized thiocyanate improves lung infection outcomes in mice.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2013; 169: 1166-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because our prior in vitro studies revealed EPO preferentially utilizes SCN− as substrate, and is even more efficient at producing OCN− than MPO (28.Arlandson M. Decker T. Roongta V.A. Bonilla L. Mayo K.H. MacPherson J.C. Hazen S.L. Slungaard A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 215-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that under eosinophilic inflammatory conditions, such as occurs within asthmatic airways, EPO might promote protein carbamylation and accompanying adverse proinflammatory effects. Herein we demonstrate for the first time that EPO-catalyzed protein carbamylation occurs during allergen-triggered asthma exacerbation and contributes to altered immune responses, triggering a cascade of inflammatory processes present in asthma. Because we previously showed EPO catalyzes production of OCN− from SCN− and H2O2 (28.Arlandson M. Decker T. Roongta V.A. Bonilla L. Mayo K.H. MacPherson J.C. Hazen S.L. Slungaard A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 215-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we first tested whether isolated human EPO could catalyze protein carbamylation, as monitored by protein-bound HCit, under physiological conditions of enzyme and reactants. Catalytic levels of EPO (60 nm) were incubated with albumin (1 mg/ml) as protein target, H2O2 (100 μm final), and plasma concentrations of Cl− (100 mm), Br− (100 μm), and SCN− (100 μm). Protein in the reaction mixture was recovered, hydrolyzed to its constituent amino acids, and protein-bound HCit was examined by HPLC with on-line electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) as described (43.Wang Z. Nicholls S.J. Rodriguez E.R. Kummu O. Hörkkö S. Barnard J. Reynolds W.F. Topol E.J. DiDonato J.A. Hazen S.L. Protein carbamylation links inflammation, smoking, uremia and atherogenesis.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1176-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In protein hydrolysates recovered from reaction mixtures of the complete EPO/H2O2/SCN− system, a new analyte was readily observed that possessed the same retention time as authentic HCit standard, as monitored using multiple parent to daughter ion transitions (e.g. m/z 190 → 173, 190 → 127, and 190 → 84) characteristic of HCit (Fig. 1A). To further confirm HCit was formed by the complete EPO/H2O2/SCN− system, the full scan collision-induced dissociation mass spectrum of the new analyte was obtained and found to be identical to authentic HCit (Fig. 1B). In additional studies, we used different isotope-labeled SCN− (i.e. natural abundance versus [13C]SCN− versus [13C,15N]SCN−) as co-substrate for EPO to trace at the atomic level the incorporation of atoms from SCN− substrate into the posttranslational modification of protein lysine residues forming protein-bound HCit.

All subjects underwent visual acuity measurement and structural analysis of the RNFL using two OCT devices (Cirrus and Spectralis). Fibromyalgia patients were evaluated according to Giesecke's fibromyalgia subgroups, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), and the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ5D) scale. We compared the differences between fibromyalgia patients and controls, and analyzed the correlations between OCT measurements, disease duration, fibromyalgia subgroups, severity, and quality of life. The impact on quality of life in fibromyalgia subgroups and in patients with different disease severity was also analyzed.A significant decrease in the RNFL was detected in fibromyalgia patients compared with controls using the two OCT devices: Cirrus OCT ganglion cell layer analysis registered a significant decrease in the minimum thickness of the inner plexiform layer (74.99±16.63 vs 79.36±3.38 μm, respectively; p = 0.023), nasal inferior, temporal inferior and temporal superior sectors (p = 0.040; 0.011 and 0.046 respectively). The Glaucoma application of the Spectralis OCT revealed thinning in the nasal, temporal inferior and temporal superior sectors (p = 0.009, 0.006, and 0.002 respectively) of fibromyalgia patients and the Axonal application in all sectors, except the nasal superior and temporal sectors. The odds ratio (OR) to estimate the size effect of FM in RNFL thickness was 1.39. RNFL atrophy was detected in patients with FIQ scores <60 (patients in early disease stages) compared with controls in the temporal inferior sector (78.74±17.75 vs 81.65±3.61; p = 0.020) and the temporal superior sector (78.20±14.50 vs 80.74±3.88; p = 0.039) with Cirrus OCT; in the temporal inferior sector (145.85±24.32 vs 150.18±19.71; p = 0.012) and temporal superior sector (131.54±20.53 vs 138.13±16.67; p = 0.002) with the Glaucoma application of the Spectralis OCT; and in all sectors, except the average, nasal superior, and temporal sectors, and parameters with the Axonal application of the Spectralis OCT. Temporal inferior RNFL thickness was significantly reduced in patients with severe fibromyalgia (FIQ≥60) compared with patients with mild fibromyalgia (FIQ<60; 145.85±24.32 vs 138.99±18.09 μm, respectively; 145.43±13.21 vs 139.85±13.09 μm, p = 0.032 with the Glaucoma application and p = 0.021 with the Axonal application). The subgroup with biologic fibromyalgia exhibited significant thinning in the temporal inferior and superior sectors (115.17±20.82 μm and 117.05±24.19 μm, respectively) compared with the depressive (130.83±22.97 μm and 127.71±26.10 μm, respectively) and atypical (128.60±26.54 μm and 125.55±23.65 μm, respectively) subgroups (p = 0.005 and 0.001 respectively).Fibromyalgia causes subclinical axonal damage in the RNFL that can be detected using innocuous and non-invasive OCT, even in the early disease stages. The impact on the RNFL in the temporal sectors is greater in patients with biologic fibromyalgia, suggesting the presence of neurodegenerative processes in this subgroup of patients with fibromyalgia."
https://openalex.org/W2513113896,"Turnover (i.e., species substitution) and nestedness (i.e., subsets of species from more diverse locations), the two main mechanisms used to explain the beta diversity of biological communities, have different implications for biodiversity conservation. To better understand how these mechanisms contribute to beta diversity, we tested the following hypotheses: (i) greater dissimilarity in community composition occurs between estuarine zones than other hierarchical level studied; (ii) beta diversity in these communities develops by turnover in estuaries with a lower degree of anthropogenic impact, but by nestedness in estuaries with a greater degree of anthropogenic impact; and (iii) the structuring mechanism is independent of season. We studied two tropical estuaries (dry and wet seasons) that vary in terms of land-use of the drainage basins. Subtidal benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled along the estuarine gradient in each of the two estuaries. The additive partitioning approach to species diversity was used to determine the hierarchical scale with the greatest dissimilarity in community composition. General beta diversity was measured using the Sorensen dissimilarity index, partitioning the turnover and nestedness components. The greatest dissimilarity in the composition of the communities occurred between the zones along the estuarine gradient in both seasons (dry = 58.6%; wet = 46.3%). In the estuary with a lower degree of anthropogenic influence, benthic macroinvertebrate diversity was generated by turnover regardless of the season. In the estuary with a greater degree of anthropogenic impact, beta diversity was structured by turnover during the dry season and a combination of both mechanisms during the wet season. We conclude that turnover is the principal mechanism responsible for beta diversity in benthic macroinvertebrate communities in tropical estuaries."
https://openalex.org/W2514831737,"Depression has been linked to an imbalance in cortisol. Until recently, cortisol has been studied by measuring concentrations at single time points in blood or saliva samples. Cortisol concentrations vary with circadian rhythm and experiences, from time point to time point. The measurement of hair cortisol concentration (HCC) is a new method of accessing mean, long-term cortisol concentrations. Recent studies show positive associations between depression and HCC, and prenatal maternal cortisol is thought to influence the developing fetus. We therefore examined the association between HCC and self-reported symptoms of depression in second trimester pregnant women. Participants were 181 women, recruited between September 2011 and October 2013 to the Little-in-Norway (LiN)-study. These women answered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Rating Scale (EPDS) on self-reported symptoms of depression, and one cm maternal scalp hair was collected and analyzed for cortisol concentrations. Multiple regression analyses did not show depressive symptoms as a predictor for HCC in our selection of pregnant women, while gestational age was significantly related. In conclusion, our study indicated that symptoms of depression during pregnancy did not predict HCC, but further studies of clinically depressed, pregnant women using gestational age as an adjustment variable are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2518056776,"Human success and even survival depends on our ability to predict what others will do by guessing what they are thinking. If I accelerate, will he yield? If I propose, will she accept? If I confess, will they forgive? Psychologists call this capacity “theory of mind.” According to current theories, we solve this problem by assuming that others are rational actors. That is, we assume that others design and execute efficient plans to achieve their goals, given their knowledge. But if this view is correct, then our theory of mind is startlingly incomplete. Human action is not always a product of rational planning, and we would be mistaken to always interpret others’ behaviors as such. A wealth of evidence indicates that we often act habitually—a form of behavioral control that depends not on rational planning, but rather on a history of reinforcement. We aim to test whether the human theory of mind includes a theory of habitual action and to assess when and how it is deployed. In a series of studies, we show that human theory of mind is sensitive to factors influencing the balance between habitual and planned behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2507636676,"The morphologies of ectodermal organs are shaped by appropriate combinations of several deformation modes, such as invagination and anisotropic tissue elongation. However, how multicellular dynamics are coordinated during deformation processes remains to be elucidated. Here, we developed a four-dimensional (4D) analysis system for tracking cell movement and division at a single-cell resolution in developing tooth epithelium. The expression patterns of a Fucci probe clarified the region- and stage-specific cell cycle patterns within the tooth germ, which were in good agreement with the pattern of the volume growth rate estimated from tissue-level deformation analysis. Cellular motility was higher in the regions with higher growth rates, while the mitotic orientation was significantly biased along the direction of tissue elongation in the epithelium. Further, these spatio-temporal patterns of cellular dynamics and tissue-level deformation were highly correlated with that of the activity of cofilin, which is an actin depolymerization factor, suggesting that the coordination of cellular dynamics via actin remodeling plays an important role in tooth epithelial morphogenesis. Our system enhances the understanding of how cellular behaviors are coordinated during ectodermal organogenesis, which cannot be observed from histological analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2507894806,"Traditionally, melissopalynological and physicochemical analyses have been the most used to determine the botanical origin of honey. However, when performed individually, these analyses may provide less unambiguous results, making it difficult to discriminate between mono and multifloral honeys. In this context, with the aim of better characterizing this beehive product, a selection of 112 Lavandula spp. monofloral honey samples from several regions were evaluated by association of multivariate statistical techniques with physicochemical, melissopalynological and phenolic compounds analysis. All honey samples fulfilled the quality standards recommended by international legislation, except regarding sucrose content and diastase activity. The content of sucrose and the percentage of Lavandula spp. pollen have a strong positive association. In fact, it was found that higher amounts of sucrose in honey are related with highest percentage of pollen of Lavandula spp.. The samples were very similar for most of the physicochemical parameters, except for proline, flavonoids and phenols (bioactive factors). Concerning the pollen spectrum, the variation of Lavandula spp. pollen percentage in honey had little contribution to the formation of samples groups. The formation of two groups regarding the physicochemical parameters suggests that the presence of other pollen types in small percentages influences the factor termed as ""bioactive"", which has been linked to diverse beneficial health effects."
https://openalex.org/W2515952294,"Accumulating evidence suggests that physical activity improves explicit memory and executive cognitive functioning at the extreme ends of the lifespan (i.e., in older adults and children). However, it is unknown whether these associations hold for younger adults who are considered to be in their cognitive prime, or for implicit cognitive functions that do not depend on motor sequencing. Here we report the results of a study in which we examine the relationship between objectively measured physical activity and (1) explicit relational memory, (2) executive control, and (3) implicit probabilistic sequence learning in a sample of healthy, college-aged adults. The main finding was that physical activity was positively associated with explicit relational memory and executive control (replicating previous research), but negatively associated with implicit learning, particularly in females. These results raise the intriguing possibility that physical activity upregulates some cognitive processes, but downregulates others. Possible implications of this pattern of results for physical health and health habits are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2516492056,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is responsible for an ongoing and intensifying epidemic in the Western Hemisphere. We examined the complete predicted proteomes, glycomes, and selectomes of 33 ZIKV strains representing temporally diverse members of the African lineage, the Asian lineage, and the current outbreak in the Americas. Derivation of the complete selectome is an 'omics' approach to identify distinct evolutionary pressures acting on different features of an organism. Employment of the M8 model did not show evidence of global diversifying selection acting on the ZIKV polyprotein; however, a mixed effect model of evolution showed strong evidence (P<0.05) for episodic diversifying selection acting on specific sites. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were predictably frequent across strains relative to the derived consensus sequence. None of the 9 published detection procedures utilize targets that share 100% identity across the 33 strains examined, indicating that ZIKV escape from molecular detection is predictable. The predicted O-linked glycome showed marked diversity across strains; however, the N-linked glycome was highly stable. All Asian and American strains examined were predicted to include glycosylation of E protein ASN154, a modification proposed to mediate neurotropism, whereas the modification was not predicted for African strains. SNP diversity, episodic diversifying selection, and differential glycosylation, particularly of ASN154, may have major biological implications for ZIKV disease. Taken together, the systems biology perspective of ZIKV indicates: a.) The recently emergent Asian/American N-glycotype is mediating the new and emerging neuropathogenic potential of ZIKV; and b.) further divergence at specific sites is predictable as endemnicity is established in the Americas."

CII is formed by “maturation” of individual subunits and their stepwise assembly into a holo-complex. SDH subunits are all encoded by the nuclear genome, synthesized in the cytosol, and post-translationally imported into mitochondria as unfolded proteins. They fold inside mitochondria and bind FAD, [Fe-S] clusters, and heme prosthetic groups that are mandatory for the maturation of the fully functional complex (21Van Vranken J.G. Na U. Winge D.R.

Assembly of large protein complexes often requires the assistance of proteins called assembly factors, i.e. proteins that assist with the formation of the complex, although not forming a part of the final functional unit. In the last decade, several assembly factors have been identified and shown to be required for the correct formation of CII, viz. Sdh5-Sdh8 in yeast and SDHAF1-SDHAF4 in humans (21Van Vranken J.G.

Initially, it was hypothesized that Sdh5 may be necessary and sufficient for flavination of Sdh1, although an NMR study showed that Sdh5 cannot bind FAD (27Eletsky A. Jeong M.Y. Kim H. Lee H.W.

In addition, thermophilic bacteria that lack SdhE feature flavinated SdhA. In this group of bacteria, flavination of SdhA does not require an assembly factor; rather, thermal energy and dicarboxylic acids drive this process (32Kounosu A.

Also, it is not currently clear whether the SDH5 protein that carries out SDHA flavination in yeast and some bacteria is generally necessary and/or sufficient for flavination of SDHA in higher organisms. In this study, we explored the role of the succinate dehydrogenase assembly factor-2 (SDHAF2) in flavination of SDHA in breast cancer cells. We report that SDHA is flavinated and CII is functional in SDHAF2 KO cells, suggesting that SDHAF2 is dispensable for flavination of SDHA in breast cancer cells. This points to an alternative mechanism of SDHA flavination in breast cancer cell mitochondria. CRISPR-Cas9 has greatly facilitated “gene editing” by means of nucleases that are sequence-specific for the target locus of interest. We used CRISPR-Cas9 nickase with low off-target effects in MDA-MB-231 cells to generate SDHAF2 KO cells (Fig. 1A). Initially, colonies were screened for deletion of the SDHAF2 gene using high-resolution melting (HRM), which was further confirmed by Western blotting (WB) and Sanger sequencing. HRM analysis showed that the SDHAF2 alleles in two clones (termed KO1 and KO2) were found to show a difference in melting curve (Fig. 1B). Both positive and negative strands were then sequenced using the Sanger method. Fig. 1C shows that these cell lines have a 17–24-nucleotide deletion in intron 1 and exon 2 junction of SDHAF2. Using an SDS-PAGE/WB analysis approach, we did not detect the SDHAF2 protein in either the SDHAF2 KO1 or the KO2 sub-lines (Fig. 1D). We next assessed the effect of SDHAF2 gene disruption on the steady state levels of several subunits of respiratory complexes. Fig. 1E shows the steady state levels of selected electron transfer chain proteins, as assessed by SDS-PAGE/WB, revealing that they were similar to each other irrespective of the SDHAF2 status. Interestingly, and rather surprisingly, we found that SDHA is flavinated in the absence of SDHAF2, as documented by a UV fluorescence assay and by WB using an antibody raised against FAD in both SDHAF2 KO1 and KO2 cells (Fig. 1F). To independently confirm that SDHAF2 is redundant for SDHA flavination, we knocked down SDHAF2 using two different siRNAs, and as a control, universal negative siRNA was used. Fig. 1G shows that knocking down the SDHAF2 protein by two different siRNAs did not affect either the level of SDHA, or its flavination status. We examined the assembly of the SDH complex in SDHAF2 KO cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, BN-PAGE followed by WB using anti-SDHA and anti-SDHB revealed fully assembled SDH complex in SDHAF2 KO cells, comparable with parental cells. Using anti-SDHAF2 IgG and native gels, we confirmed the absence of the assembly factor in the KO lines (Fig. 2A). We next tested whether the assembled SDH complex in SDHAF2 KO cells is functional using an in-gel activity assay. As indicated in Fig. 2B, the in-gel assay revealed that assembled CII in both SDHAF2 KO cell lines is active. CII features two enzymatic activities, i.e. the SDH activity, whereby the catalytic SDHA subunit in mitochondrial matrix oxidizes succinate to fumarate, and the SQR activity, by means of which electrons generated by succinate oxidation are transferred via the SDHB [Fe-S] clusters to ubiquinone, reducing it to ubiquinol (10Miyadera H.

Biol. 2008; 28: 718-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We next tested whether SDH and SQR activities are compromised in SDHAF2 KO cells. We performed analysis of SDH and SQR activities in the absence and presence of their specific inhibitors 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) and thenoyl trifluoroacetic acid (TTFA), respectively, and found no difference in either of the two activities between parental and SDHAF2 KO cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Taken together, SDHAF2 KO breast cancer cells maintain functionally active CII. To find whether the absence of SDHAF2 affects other mitochondrial respiratory complexes, we assessed the assembly of CI, CIII, CIV, and CV using BN-PAGE. We found that all complexes as well as supercomplexes assembled irrespective of the SDHAF2 status (Fig. 2E). Oxygen consumption was then assessed using the Oxygraph-2k apparatus. Once again, we observed differences in neither routine nor CI-/CII-dependent respiration between parental and SDHAF2 KO cells (Fig. 2, F and G). Yeast cells with deleted Sdh5 feature proliferation defects and cannot grow in non-oxidative media; they also lack SDH activity (25Hao H.X. Khalimonchuk O. Schraders M. Dephoure N. Bayley J.P.

Solution NMR structure of yeast succinate dehydrogenase flavinylation factor Sdh5 reveals a putative Sdh1 binding site.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 8475-8477Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We observed a decrease in glucose-dependent proliferation in SDHAF2 KO cells as compared with their parental counterparts (Fig. 2H, left panel). We then tested whether SDHAF2 KO cells proliferate in galactose-containing media as a read-out of OXPHOS activity. We found only a slight difference between the growth of SDHAF2 KO and parental cell lines in galactose-containing media (Fig. 2H, right panel). These results indicate that knock-out of SDHAF2/SDH5 has a mild effect on the proliferation rate, but this effect appears to be independent of OXPHOS. SDH integrates two essential mitochondrial pathways, OXPHOS and the TCA cycle. The flavoprotein SDHA catalyzes oxidation of succinate to fumarate. For this, a covalent insertion of FAD (flavination) to SDHA subunit is essential. The yeast Sdh5 was identified as a protein mediating flavination of Sdh1 (SDHA in mammals) (25Hao H.X. Khalimonchuk O. Schraders M. Dephoure N. Bayley J.P. Kunst H. Devilee P. Cremers C.W. Schiffman J.D. Bentz B.G. Gygi S.P. Winge D.R. Kremer H. Rutter J.

However, studies from certain bacterial strains and plants indicate that the function of the SDH5 family proteins may be species-dependent. In this study, we generated an SDHAF2 KO human breast cancer cell line, and unexpectedly, identified SDHAF2 to be dispensable for flavination of SDHA and assembly of the complex. We examined whether SDHA is flavinated using FAD autofluorescence and an antibody raised against FAD (Fig. 1F). Both approaches resulted in identification of flavinated SDHA in SDHAF2 KO cells, and this was independently confirmed in SDHAF2 knockdown cells. We also detected both SQR and SDH activity in SDHAF2 KO cells, indicating functionally active CII (Fig. 2, B–D). In agreement with our data, mouse SDH5 KO (33Liu J. Gao L. Zhang H. Wang D. Wang M.

Albeit reduced, functional CII was detected on the basis of enzymatic activities of SDH and SQR and in-gel activity following BN-PAGE in SDHAF2 KO Arabidopsis (34Huang S. Taylor N.L. Ströher E.

To date, studies on the role of SDHAF2 in mammalian systems have been limited. Fully assembled CII is critical for both TCA cycle and OXPHOS functions. For example, SDHD KO mice were found embryonically lethal (35Piruat J.I. Pintado C.O. Ortega-Sáenz P. Roche M. López-Barneo J.

When human SDHAF2 was expressed in Sdh5 KO yeast, Sdh1 was again flavinated and CII assembled (25Hao H.X. Khalimonchuk O. Schraders M. Dephoure N. Bayley J.P. Kunst H. Devilee P. Cremers C.W.

SDH5, a gene required for flavination of succinate dehydrogenase, is mutated in paraganglioma.Science. 2009; 325: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). SDHAF2/SDH5 was also shown to flavinate SDHA in a cell-free system (38Zafreen L. Walker-Kopp N. Huang L.S. Berry E. In-vitro, SDH5-dependent flavinylation of immobilized human respiratory complex II flavoprotein.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2016; 604: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). On the contrary, our data using breast cancer cells clearly document that flavination of SDHA and assembly of CII occur in the absence of SDHAF2, indicating that SDHAF2 is dispensable for flavination of succinate dehydrogenase. We have recently shown that the G78R mutation in the SDHAF2 gene, previously identified in a PGL2 patient (25Hao H.X. Khalimonchuk O. Schraders M. Dephoure N. Bayley J.P. Kunst H. Devilee P. Cremers C.W. Schiffman J.D. Bentz B.G. Gygi S.P. Winge D.R. Kremer H. Rutter J. SDH5, a gene required for flavination of succinate dehydrogenase, is mutated in paraganglioma.Science. 2009; 325: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), affects association of the assembly factor with SDHA (26Bezawork-Geleta A.

Rep. 2015; 5: 17397Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). SDHAF2 is now classified as a tumor suppressor. The following question arises: What is the role of SDHAF2 in the context of CII and how is SDHA flavinated in breast cancer cells? It cannot be excluded that the species-dependent differences in the role of SDHAF2 in flavination of SDHA reflect evolutional aspects, and there might be functional redundancy at least in certain mammalian cells epitomized here by breast cancer cells. Notwithstanding the above unresolved questions, our finding clearly points to the notion that we are far from understanding all the details of genetics, biology, and function of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, as exemplified here by the relatively simple heterotetrameric protein complex CII. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma) and antibiotic-anti-mycotic mixture. Cells were grown at 37 °C under atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with a CRISPR-Cas9 nickase (Cas9n D10A) construct targeting exon 2 of the human SDHAF2 gene. For this, the Cas9 expression plasmid CP-C9NI-02 and the sgRNA plasmid (pCRISPR-SG01) with guide sequences AAT GAT GTC ACA CTG AGC AA and CAG CCC AAC AGA TTC CCA AA were used (GeneCopoeia). To facilitate co-selection of cells expressing the two vectors, each vector contained a distinct selection marker for neomycin and hygromycin to select cells expressing Cas9 and sgRNA, respectively. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with a 1:1:1 mixture of the sgRNA construct (L and R) and vectors encoding Cas9 using Lipofectamine® 3000 reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Two days after transfection, cells were selected in 500 μg/ml hygromycin B and 700 μg/ml neomycin for 72 h, followed by plating at ∼1 cell/well in 96-well plates for clonal expansion. Knock-out clones were identified by high-resolution melting curve, which was confirmed by WB, using SDHAF2-specific antibodies and Sanger sequencing. Two sets of mission siRNA (Sigma) for human SDHAF2 (SASI_Hs01_00053252 and SASI_Hs01_00053255) and universal scrambled RNA (SIC002) were used. siRNAs were transfected into 50% confluent MB-MDA-231 cells in 6-well plates using Lipofectamine® 3000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were harvested after 72 h for analysis. Protein samples were denatured, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and incubated with anti-SDH5 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), anti-FAD (1:500, MyBioSource), anti-SDHA, anti-SDHB anti-actin, anti-HSP60 (1:1000, Abcam), anti-NDUFA9, anti-Core I, or anti-COX5a IgG (1:1000, Thermo Scientific). Secondary HRP antibodies were then applied, and the membranes were visualized using the ECL WB substrate (Thermo Scientific). Mitochondria were isolated from cultured cell lines as described previously (32Kounosu A.

After electrophoresis, the complexes were blotted onto PVDF membranes and sequentially probed with specific antibodies against CI (anti-NDUFA9), CIII (anti-Core I), CIV (anti-COX5a), and CII (anti-SDHA and anti-SDHB).

https://openalex.org/W2518203099,"Purpose Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody therapy is an effective treatment for ocular angiogenesis. Although the intraocular pressure of some patients increases after anti-VEGF therapy, the effects of VEGF-A on the aqueous humor outflow pathway remain unknown. This study investigated the effects of VEGF-A on the aqueous humor outflow pathway. Methods We used human recombinant VEGF121 and VEGF165. Trabecular meshwork (TM) and Schlemm’s canal endothelial (SCE) cells were isolated from the eyes of cynomolgus monkeys. Expression of mRNA coding four VEGF receptors, VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), neuropilin-1, and neuropilin-2, was examined by RT-PCR. To evaluate the permeability of cell monolayers, we measured transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). The outflow facility was measured in perfused porcine anterior segment organ cultures treated with 30 ng/mL VEGF121 for 48 h. Results Four VEGF-A-related receptor mRNAs were expressed in TM and SCE cells. The TEER of TM cells was not significantly affected by VEGF121 or VEGF165 treatment. In contrast, the TEER of SCE cells was significantly lower 48 h after treatment with 30 ng/mL VEGF121 to 69.4 ± 12.2% of baseline (n = 10), which was a significant difference compared with the control (P = 0.0001). VEGF165 (30 ng/mL) decreased the TEER of SCE cells at 48 h after treatment to 72.3 ± 14.1% compared with the baseline (n = 10), which was not a significant difference compared with the control (P = 0.0935). Ki8751, a selective VEGFR2 inhibitor, completely suppressed the effect of VEGF121 on SCE cell permeability, although ZM306416, a selective VEGFR1 inhibitor, did not affect the VEGF121-induced decrease in TEER. Perfusion with 30 ng/mL of VEGF121 for 48 h significantly increased the outflow facility compared with the control (47.8 ± 28.5%, n = 5, P = 0.013). Conclusions These results suggest that VEGF-A may regulate the conventional aqueous outflow of SCE cells through VEGFR2."
https://openalex.org/W2511472714,"Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is caused by mutations of the transthyretin (TTR) gene, predominantly expressed in the liver. Two compounds that knockdown TTR, comprising a small interfering RNA (siRNA; ALN-TTR-02) and an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO; IONIS-TTRRx), are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Since primary hepatocytes from FAP patients are rarely available for molecular analysis and commercial tissue culture cells or animal models lack the patient-specific genetic background, this study uses primary cells derived from urine of FAP patients. Urine-derived cells were reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with high efficiency. Hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) showing typical hepatic marker expression were obtained from iPSCs of the FAP patients. TTR mRNA expression of FAP HLCs almost reached levels measured in human hepatocytes. To assess TTR knockdown, siTTR1 and TTR-ASO were introduced to HLCs. A significant downregulation (>80%) of TTR mRNA was induced in the HLCs by both oligonucleotides. TTR protein present in the cell culture supernatant of HLCs was similarly downregulated. Gene expression of other hepatic markers was not affected by the therapeutic oligonucleotides. Our data indicate that urine cells (UCs) after reprogramming and hepatic differentiation represent excellent primary human target cells to assess the efficacy and specificity of novel compounds."

This prospective study aimed to determine whether altered peripheral regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and defined subsets, besides a broadened anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) response, may qualify as biomarkers for RA development in SAP.Thirty-four consecutive SAP were prospectively assessed every 6 months for minimally 2 years. At inclusion, peripheral Treg (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) numbers and subsets, defined as CD45RA+FoxP3low naive Tregs (Fr I), CD45RA-FoxP3high activated Tregs (Fr II) and CD45RA-FoxP3low non-Tregs (Fr III), were compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC, n = 16) and treatment-naive RA patients (n = 12). SAP that developed RA were compared to non-switchers and analyzed for Treg numbers and Treg subsets at inclusion. Also, Treg numbers and subsets were compared in switched SAP before and at diagnosis. To assess the ACPA repertoire, IgG and IgA reactivity was measured against citrullinated peptides from fibrinogen, α-enolase and vimentin.Treg numbers were similar between HC, SAP and RA patients. Although the bonafide Treg subsets Fr I and Fr II were comparable between groups, Fr III was increased in SAP compared to HC (p = 0.01). Fourteen (41%) SAP developed RA during follow-up. Their Treg numbers and subsets were comparable to non-switched SAP. At RA diagnosis, Treg numbers in switched SAP were similar to 6 months before. Switched SAP displayed a more diverse IgG ACPA repertoire compared to non-switched SAP (p = 0.046) and showed more IgA reactivity than non-switched SAP reaching significance for Fib1 only (p = 0.047).Numbers of Total Treg and bonafide Treg subsets are not indicative for RA development in SAP, opposed to the ACPA repertoire."
https://openalex.org/W2516368088,"The evolutionarily conserved RNA polymerase II transcription factor D (TFIID) complex is composed of TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (Tafs). The mechanisms by which many Taf subunits contribute to the essential function of TFIID are only poorly understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we present the results of a molecular genetic dissection of the TFIID subunit Taf2. Through systematic site-directed mutagenesis, we have discovered 12 taf2 temperature-sensitive (ts) alleles. Two of these alleles display growth defects that can be strongly suppressed by overexpression of the yeast-specific TFIID subunit TAF14 but not by overexpression of any other TFIID subunit. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Taf14 is also a constituent of six other transcription-related complexes, making interpretation of its role in each of these complexes difficult. Although Taf14 is not conserved as a TFIID subunit in metazoans, it is conserved through its chromatin-binding YEATS domain. Based on the Taf2-Taf14 genetic interaction, we demonstrate that Taf2 and Taf14 directly interact and mapped the Taf2-Taf14 interaction domains. We used this information to identify a Taf2 separation-of-function variant (Taf2-ΔC). Although Taf2-ΔC no longer interacts with Taf14 in vivo or in vitro, it stably incorporates into the TFIID complex. In addition, purified Taf2-ΔC mutant TFIID is devoid of Taf14, making this variant a powerful reagent for determining the role of Taf14 in TFIID function. Furthermore, we characterized the mechanism through which Taf14 suppresses taf2ts alleles, shedding light on how Taf2-Taf14 interaction contributes to TFIID complex organization and identifying a potential role for Taf14 in mediating TFIID-chromatin interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2517117329,"The human ABO blood group system is of great importance in blood transfusion and organ transplantation. The ABO system is composed of complex carbohydrate structures that are biosynthesized by A- and B-transferases encoded by the ABO gene. However, the mechanisms regulating ABO gene expression in epithelial cells remain obscure. On the basis of DNase I-hypersensitive sites in and around ABO in epithelial cells, we prepared reporter plasmid constructs including these sites. Subsequent luciferase assays and histone modifications indicated a novel positive regulatory element, designated the +22.6-kb site, downstream from ABO, and this was shown to enhance ABO promoter activity in an epithelial cell-specific manner. Expression of ABO and B-antigen was reduced in gastric cancer KATOIII cells by biallelic deletion of the +22.6-kb site using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that the site bound to an epithelial cell-specific transcription factor, Elf5. Mutation of the Ets binding motifs to abrogate binding of this factor reduced the regulatory activity of the +22.6-kb site. Furthermore, ELF5 knockdown with shRNA reduced both endogenous transcription from ABO and B-antigen expression in KATOIII cells. Thus, Elf5 appeared to be involved in the enhancer potential of the +22.6-kb site. These results support the contention that ABO expression is dependent upon a downstream positive regulatory element functioning through a tissue-restricted transcription factor, Elf5, in epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2510141700,"The replication licensing factor CDC6 recruits the MCM2-7 replicative helicase to the replication origin, where MCM2-7 is activated to initiate DNA replication. MCM2-7 is activated by both the CDC7-Dbf4 kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase and via interactions with CDC45 and go-ichi-ni-san complex (GINS) to form the CDC45·MCM2-7·GINS (CMG) helicase complex. TIMELESS (TIM) is important for the subsequent coupling of CMG activity to DNA polymerases for efficient DNA synthesis. However, the mechanism by which TIM regulates CMG activity for proper replication fork progression remains unclear. Here we show that TIM interacts with MCM2-7 prior to the initiation of DNA replication. TIM depletion in various human cell lines results in the accumulation of aberrant CMG helicase complexes on chromatin. Importantly, the presence of these abnormal CMG helicase complexes is not restricted to cells undergoing DNA synthesis. Furthermore, even though these aberrant CMG complexes interact with the DNA polymerases on human chromatin, these complexes are not phosphorylated properly by cyclin-dependent kinase/CDC7-Dbf4 kinase and exhibit reduced DNA unwinding activity. This phenomenon coincides with a significant accumulation of the p27 and p21 replication inhibitors, reduced chromatin association of CDC6 and cyclin E, and a delay in S phase entry. Our results provide the first evidence that TIM is required for the correct chromatin association of the CMG complex to allow efficient DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2513725482,"The species concept in marine phytoplankton is defined based on genomic, morphological, and functional properties. Reports of intraspecific diversity are widespread across major phytoplankton groups but the impacts of this variation on ecological and biogeochemical processes are often overlooked. Intraspecific diversity is well known within coccolithophores, which play an important role in the marine carbon cycle via production of particulate inorganic carbon. In this study, we investigated strain-specific responses to temperature in terms of morphology, carbon production, and carbonate mineralogy using a combination of microscopy, elemental analysis, flow cytometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance. Two strains of the cosmopolitan coccolithophore E. huxleyi isolated from different regions (subtropical, CCMP371; temperate, CCMP3266) were cultured under a range of temperature conditions (10°C, 15°C, and 20°C) using batch cultures and sampled during both exponential and stationary growth. Results for both strains showed that growth rates decreased at lower temperatures while coccosphere size increased. Between 15°C and 20°C, both strains produced similar amounts of total carbon, but differed in allocation of that carbon between particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) and particulate organic carbon (POC), though temperature effects were not detected. Between 10°C and 20°C, temperature effects on daily production of PIC and POC, as well as the cellular quota of POC were detected in CCMP3266. Strain-specific differences in coccolith shedding rates were found during exponential growth. In addition, daily shedding rates were negatively related to temperature in CCMP371 but not in CCMP3266. Despite differences in rates of particulate inorganic carbon production, both strains were found to produce coccoliths composed entirely of pure calcite, as established by solid-state 13C and 43Ca NMR and X-ray diffraction measurements. These results highlight the limitations of the species concept and the need for a trait-based system to better quantify diversity within marine phytoplankton communities."
https://openalex.org/W2399995292,"The theory of finite-size scaling explains how the singular behavior of thermodynamic quantities in the critical point of a phase transition emerges when the size of the system becomes infinite. Usually, this theory is presented in a phenomenological way. Here, we exactly demonstrate the existence of a finite-size scaling law for the Galton-Watson branching processes when the number of offsprings of each individual follows either a geometric distribution or a generalized geometric distribution. We also derive the corrections to scaling and the limits of validity of the finite-size scaling law away the critical point. A mapping between branching processes and random walks allows us to establish that these results also hold for the latter case, for which the order parameter turns out to be the probability of hitting a distant boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2517666626,"Articular cartilage has poor healing ability and cartilage injuries often evolve to osteoarthritis. Cell-based strategies aiming to engineer cartilaginous tissue through the combination of biocompatible scaffolds and articular chondrocytes represent an alternative to standard surgical techniques. In this context, perfusion bioreactors have been introduced to enhance cellular access to oxygen and nutrients, hence overcoming the limitations of static culture and improving matrix deposition. Here, we combined an optimized cocktail of soluble factors, the BIT (BMP-2, Insulin, Thyroxin), and clinical-grade collagen sponges with a bidirectional perfusion bioreactor, namely the oscillating perfusion bioreactor (OPB), to engineer in vitro articular cartilage by human articular chondrocytes (HACs) obtained from osteoarthritic patients. After amplification, HACs were seeded and cultivated in collagen sponges either in static or dynamic conditions. Chondrocyte phenotype and the nature of the matrix synthesized by HACs were assessed using western blotting and immunohistochemistry analyses. Finally, the stability of the cartilaginous tissue produced by HACs was evaluated in vivo by subcutaneous implantation in nude mice. Our results showed that perfusion improved the distribution and quality of cartilaginous matrix deposited within the sponges, compared to static conditions. Specifically, dynamic culture in the OPB, in combination with the BIT cocktail, resulted in the homogeneous production of extracellular matrix rich in type II collagen. Remarkably, the production of type I collagen, a marker of fibrous tissues, was also inhibited, indicating that the association of the OPB with the BIT cocktail limits fibrocartilage formation, favoring the reconstruction of hyaline cartilage."
https://openalex.org/W2510079094,"Forested settings present challenges for understanding the full extent of past human landscape modifications. Field-based archaeological reconnaissance in forests is low-efficiency and most remote sensing techniques are of limited utility, and together, this means many past sites and features in forests are unknown. Archaeologists have increasingly used light detection and ranging (lidar), a remote sensing tool that uses pulses of light to measure reflecting surfaces at high spatial resolution, to address these limitations. Archaeology studies using lidar have made significant progress identifying permanent structures built by large-scale complex agriculturalist societies. Largely unaccounted for, however, are numerous small and more practical modifications of landscapes by smaller-scale societies. Here we show these may also be detectable with lidar by identifying remnants of food storage pits (cache pits) created by mobile hunter-gatherers in the upper Great Lakes during Late Precontact (ca. AD 1000–1600) that now only exist as subtle microtopographic features. Years of intensive field survey identified 69 cache pit groups between two inland lakes in northern Michigan, almost all of which were located within ~500 m of a lakeshore. Applying a novel series of image processing techniques and statistical analyses to a high spatial resolution DTM we created from commercial-grade lidar, our detection routine identified 139 high potential cache pit clusters. These included most of the previously known clusters as well as several unknown clusters located >1500 m from either lakeshore, much further from lakeshores than all previously identified cultural sites. Food storage is understood to have emerged regionally as a risk-buffering strategy after AD 1000 but our results indicate the current record of hunter-gatherer cache pit food storage is markedly incomplete and this practice and its associated impact on the landscape may be greater than anticipated. Our study also demonstrates the potential of harnessing commercial-grade lidar for other fine-grained archaeology applications."
https://openalex.org/W2512656788,"We investigated the in vitro and in vivo anticancer effect of combining lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP)-inducing agent N-dodecylimidazole (NDI) with glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG). NDI-triggered LMP and 2DG-mediated glycolysis block synergized in inducing rapid ATP depletion, mitochondrial damage, and reactive oxygen species production, eventually leading to necrotic death of U251 glioma cells but not primary astrocytes. NDI/2DG-induced death of glioma cells was partly prevented by lysosomal cathepsin inhibitor E64 and antioxidant α-tocopherol, suggesting the involvement of LMP and oxidative stress in the observed cytotoxicity. LMP-inducing agent chloroquine also displayed a synergistic anticancer effect with 2DG, whereas glucose deprivation or glycolytic inhibitors iodoacetate and sodium fluoride synergistically cooperated with NDI, thus further indicating that the anticancer effect of NDI/2DG combination was indeed due to LMP and glycolysis block. The two agents synergistically induced ATP depletion, mitochondrial depolarization, oxidative stress, and necrotic death also in B16 mouse melanoma cells. Moreover, the combined oral administration of NDI and 2DG reduced in vivo melanoma growth in C57BL/6 mice by inducing necrotic death of tumor cells, without causing liver, spleen, or kidney toxicity. Based on these results, we propose that NDI-triggered LMP causes initial mitochondrial damage that is further increased by 2DG due to the lack of glycolytic ATP required to maintain mitochondrial health. This leads to a positive feedback cycle of mitochondrial dysfunction, ATP loss, and reactive oxygen species production, culminating in necrotic cell death. Therefore, the combination of LMP-inducing agents and glycolysis inhibitors seems worthy of further exploration as an anticancer strategy."

Putrescine, spermidine and spermine are essential for the development of the gut and immune system of newborns, and are all found in human milk. Little is known, however, about the role of histamine, tyramine or cadaverine in breast milk. Nor is it known whether mastitis alters the BA composition of milk. The BA profile of human milk, and the influence of mastitis on BA concentrations, were therefore investigated. Putrescine, spermidine and spermine were the main BAs detected. In mastitis-affected milk, the concentrations of putrescine, spermine and histamine were higher."
https://openalex.org/W2507250701,"Inflammation in the mammary gland (mastitis) is the most common disease in dairy herds worldwide, often caused by the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Little is known about the effects of mastitis on drug transporters and the impact on transporter-mediated excretion of drugs into milk. We used murine mammary epithelial HC11 cells, after lactogenic differentiation into a secreting phenotype, and studied gene expressions of ABC- and SLC- transporters after treatment of cells with S. aureus and lipopolysaccharide, an endotoxin secreted by E. coli. The studied transporters were Bcrp, Mdr1, Mrp1, Oatp1a5, Octn1 and Oct1. In addition, Csn2, the gene encoding β-casein, was analyzed. As biomarkers of the inflammatory response, gene expressions of the cytokines Il6 and Tnfα and the chemokine Cxcl2 were determined. Our results show that S. aureus and LPS treatment of cells, at non-cytotoxic concentrations, induced an up-regulation of Mdr1 and of the inflammatory biomarkers, except that Tnfα was not affected by lipopolysaccharide. By simple regression analysis we could demonstrate statistically significant positive correlations between each of the transporters with each of the inflammatory biomarkers in cells treated with S. aureus. The coefficients of determination (R2) were 0.7-0.9 for all but one correlation. After treatment of cells with lipopolysaccharide, statistically significant correlations were only found between Mdr1 and the two parameters Cxcl2 and Il6. The expression of Csn2 was up-regulated in cells treated with S. aureus, indicating that the secretory function of the cells was not impaired. The strong correlation in gene expressions between transporters and inflammatory biomarkers may suggest a co-regulation and that the transporters have a role in the transport of cytokines and chemokines. Our results demonstrate that transporters in mammary cells can be affected by infection, which may have an impact on transport of essential compounds and contaminants into milk."
https://openalex.org/W2510560851,"Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasm (OSSN) is the neoplasia arising from the conjunctiva, cornea and limbus. OSSN ranges from mild, moderate, severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ (CIS) to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Recent findings on cancer stem cells theory indicate that population of stem-like cell as in neoplasia determines its heterogeneity and complexity leading to varying tumor development of metastatic behavior and recurrence. Cancer stem cell markers are not much explored in the cases of OSSN. In the present study, we aim to evaluate the expression of stem cells using stem cell markers mainly p63, ABCG2, c-KIT (CD117) and CD44 in OSSN tissue, which could have prognostic significance. The present study tries for the first time to explore expression of these stem markers in the cases of OSSN. These cases are subdivided into two groups. One group comprises of carcinoma in situ (n = 6) and the second group comprises of invasive carcinoma (n = 6). The mean age at presentation was 52 years; with 53 years for CIS group and 52 years for SCC group. From each group section from the paraffin block were taken for the IHC staining of p63, c-Kit, ABCG2 and CD44. Our experiments show high expression of P63 and CD44 in the cases of CIN and SCC. Both CIS and SCC displayed positive staining with p63, with more than 80% cells staining positive. However minimal expression of c-kit in both CIN and SCC. But surprisingly we got high expression of ABCG2 in cases of carcinoma in situ as compared to that of invasive squamous cell carcinoma. More than 50% of cells showed CD44 positivity in both CIS and SCC groups. Our results show for the first time that these four stem cells especially the limbal epithelium stem cells play a vital role in the genesis of OSSN but we need to explore more cases before establishing its clinical and biological significance."
https://openalex.org/W2513210242,"Background The burden of blindness from glaucoma is high. Therefore, people suffering from a serious eye disease such as glaucoma, which can lead to blindness, usually have an emotional disturbance on the patient. Untreated psychiatric illness is associated with increased morbidity and increased costs of care. Objective This study aimed to assess prevalence of common mental disorders and associated factors among people with Glaucoma attending Menelik II referral hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2014. Methods Institution based Cross-sectional study design was conducted in the Department of Ophthalmology Menelik II Referral Hospital from April 10 to May 15, 2014. 423 participants who had undergone through investigation, examination and diagnosed as patients of glaucoma were selected randomly from the glaucoma clinic. Data were collected through face to face interview using Self Reporting Questionnaire consisted of 20 items. Study subjects who scored ≥11 from SRQ-20 were considered as having common mental disorders. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis with 95% CI were done and variables with P<0.05 in the final model were identified as independent factors associated with common mental disorders. Results Four hundred five patients with glaucoma were included in our study with response rate of 95.7% and 64.5% were males. The average age was 59±13.37 years. Common mental disorders were observed in 23.2% of Glaucoma patients. It is quite obvious that levels of CMDs were high among patients with glaucoma. There was a significant association between age, sex, chronic physical illness, income and duration of illness at P < 0.05. Conclusion and Recommendation Symptoms of common mental disorders were the commonest comorbidities among patients with glaucoma. It will be better to assess and treat Common mental disorders as a separate illness in patients with glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W2517176964,"The thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) is the major pathway for salt reabsorption in the mammalian distal convoluted tubule. NCC plays a key role in the regulation of blood pressure. Its inhibition with thiazides constitutes the primary baseline therapy for arterial hypertension. However, the thiazide-binding site in NCC is unknown. Mammals have only one gene encoding for NCC. The eel, however, contains a duplicate gene. NCCα is an ortholog of mammalian NCC and is expressed in the kidney. NCCβ is present in the apical membrane of the rectum. Here we cloned and functionally characterized NCCβ from the European eel. The cRNA encodes a 1043-amino acid membrane protein that, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, functions as an Na-Cl cotransporter with two major characteristics, making it different from other known NCCs. First, eel NCCβ is resistant to thiazides. Single-point mutagenesis supports that the absence of thiazide inhibition is, at least in part, due to the substitution of a conserved serine for a cysteine at position 379. Second, NCCβ is not activated by low-chloride hypotonic stress, although the unique Ste20-related proline alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) binding site in the amino-terminal domain is conserved. Thus, NCCβ exhibits significant functional differences from NCCs that could be helpful in defining several aspects of the structure-function relationship of this important cotransporter."
https://openalex.org/W2515209030,"Protein Z (PZ) is an anticoagulant that binds with high affinity to Protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI) and accelerates the rate of ZPI-mediated inhibition of factor Xa (fXa) by more than 1000-fold in the presence of Ca2+ and phospholipids. PZ promotion of the ZPI-fXa interaction results from the anchoring of the Gla domain of PZ onto phospholipid surfaces and positioning the bound ZPI in close proximity to the Gla-anchored fXa, forming a ternary complex of PZ/ZPI/fXa. Although interaction of PZ with phospholipid membrane appears to be absolutely crucial for its cofactor activity, little is known about the binding of different phospholipids to PZ. The present study was conceived to understand the interaction of different phospholipids with PZ. Experiments with both soluble lipids and model membranes revealed that PZ binds to phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) with equal affinity (Kd~48 μM); further, PS and PE bound to PZ synergistically. Equilibrium dialysis experiments revealed two lipid-binding sites for both PS and PE. PZ binds with weaker affinity to other phospholipids, e.g., phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine and binding of these lipids is not synergistic with respect to PS. Both PS and PE -containing membranes supported the formation of a fXa-PZ complex. PZ protection of fXa from antithrombin inhibition were also shown to be comparable in presence of both PS: PC and PE: PC membranes. These findings are particularly important and intriguing since they suggest a special affinity of PZ, in vivo, towards activated platelets, the primary membrane involved in blood coagulation process."
https://openalex.org/W2517485794,"VWF is extensively glycosylated with biantennary core fucosylated glycans. Most N-linked and O-linked glycans on VWF are sialylated. FVIII is also glycosylated, with a glycan structure similar to that of VWF. ST3GAL sialyltransferases catalyze the transfer of sialic acids in the α2,3 linkage to termini of N- and O-glycans. This sialic acid modification is critical for VWF synthesis and activity. We analyzed genetic and phenotypic data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study for the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ST3GAL4 gene with plasma VWF levels and FVIII activity in 12,117 subjects. We also analyzed ST3GAL4 SNPs found in 2,535 subjects of 26 ethnicities from the 1000 Genomes (1000G) project for ethnic diversity, SNP imputation, and ST3GAL4 haplotypes. We identified 14 and 1,714 ST3GAL4 variants in the ARIC GWAS and 1000G databases respectively, with 46% being ethnically diverse in their allele frequencies. Among the 14 ST3GAL4 SNPs found in ARIC GWAS, the intronic rs2186717, rs7928391, and rs11220465 were associated with VWF levels and with FVIII activity after adjustment for age, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, ever-smoking status, and ABO. This study illustrates the power of next-generation sequencing in the discovery of new genetic variants and a significant ethnic diversity in the ST3GAL4 gene. We discuss potential mechanisms through which these intronic SNPs regulate ST3GAL4 biosynthesis and the activity that affects VWF and FVIII."
https://openalex.org/W2512970755,"Background This study aimed to investigate the potential influence of venue-based networks on HCV transmission in HIV-positive gay and bisexual men (GBM). Methods This was a prospectively recruited cohort of HIV-infected GBM with recently-acquired HCV infection resident in Melbourne and Sydney. Clinical and demographic data were collected together with blood samples for HCV sequencing. Phylogenies were inferred and clusters of individuals infected with HCV with genetic sequence homology were identified. Venues used for sourcing sexual partners were identified; sourcing partners from the same venue was considered a potential social link. Using the Jaccard similarity coefficient, associations were identified between the network of sites where men sourced sex partners and transmission relationships as defined by phylogenetic clustering. Results Forty individuals were recruited, of whom 62.5% were considered to have sexually- and 37.5% IDU-acquired HCV. Venue use was consistent with men being members of a more sexually adventurous gay community subculture. Six phylogenetically-determined pairs or clusters were identified, comprising fifteen (15/28, 53.6%) individuals. Participants belonging to phylogenetic clusters were observed within the same networks. There was a significant correlation between the network and phylogenetic clustering when both cities were considered simultaneously (p = 0.005), raising the possibility that social connections may be important for HCV transmissions. Conclusions Venue-based network elicitation is a promising approach for elucidating HCV transmissions amongst HIV-infected GBM. Public health approaches targeting individuals and venues prominent within networks may reduce onward HCV transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2518169392,"Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels are critical in the generation and transmission of neuronal signals in mammals. The crystal structures of several prokaryotic Nav channels determined in recent years inspire the mechanistic studies on their selection upon the permeable cations (especially between Na+ and K+ ions), a property that is proposed to be mainly determined by residues in the selectivity filter. However, the mechanism of cation selection in mammalian Nav channels lacks direct explanation at atomic level due to the difference in amino acid sequences between mammalian and prokaryotic Nav homologues, especially at the constriction site where the DEKA motif has been identified to determine the Na+/K+ selectivity in mammalian Nav channels but is completely absent in the prokaryotic counterparts. Among the DEKA residues, Lys is of the most importance since its mutation to Arg abolishes the Na+/K+ selectivity. In this work, we modeled the pore domain of mammalian Nav channels by mutating the four residues at the constriction site of a prokaryotic Nav channel (NavRh) to DEKA, and then mechanistically investigated the contribution of Lys in cation selection using molecular dynamics simulations. The DERA mutant was generated as a comparison to understand the loss of ion selectivity caused by the K-to-R mutation. Simulations and free energy calculations on the mutants indicate that Lys facilitates Na+/K+ selection by electrostatically repelling the cation to a highly Na+-selective location sandwiched by the carboxylate groups of Asp and Glu at the constriction site. In contrast, the electrostatic repulsion is substantially weakened when Lys is mutated to Arg, because of two intrinsic properties of the Arg side chain: the planar geometric design and the sparse charge distribution of the guanidine group."
https://openalex.org/W2511289483,"In microendoscopic discectomy for spinal disorders, bone cutting procedures are performed in tight spaces while observing a small portion of the target structures. Although optical tracking systems are able to measure the tip of the surgical tool during surgery, the poor shape information available during surgery makes accurate cutting difficult, even if preoperative computed tomography and magnetic resonance images are used for reference. Shape estimation and visualization of the target structures are essential for accurate cutting. However, time-varying shape changes during cutting procedures are still challenging issues for intraoperative navigation. This paper introduces a concept of endoscopic image augmentation that overlays shape changes to support bone cutting procedures. This framework handles the history of the location of the measured drill tip as a volume label and visualizes the remains to be cut overlaid on the endoscopic image in real time. A cutting experiment was performed with volunteers, and the feasibility of this concept was examined using a clinical navigation system. The efficacy of the cutting aid was evaluated with respect to the shape similarity, total moved distance of a cutting tool, and required cutting time. The results of the experiments showed that cutting performance was significantly improved by the proposed framework."

Exposure to glucocorticoids during development has been hypothesized to underlie different functional gastrointestinal (GI) and motility disorders. Herein, we investigated the impact of in utero exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids (iuGC) on GI function of adult rats. Wistar male rats, born from pregnant dams treated with dexamethasone (DEX), were studied at different ages. Length, histologic analysis, proliferation and apoptosis assays, GI transit, permeability and serotonin (5-HT) content of GI tract were measured. iuGC treatment decreased small intestine size and decreased gut transit. However, iuGC had no impact on intestinal permeability. iuGC differentially impacts the structure and function of the GI tract, which leads to long-lasting alterations in the small intestine that may predispose subjects prone to disorders of the GI tract."
https://openalex.org/W2516049406,"Following activation of naïve T cells there are dynamic changes in the metabolic pathways used by T cells to support both the energetic needs of the cell and the macromolecules required for growth and proliferation. Among other changes, lipid metabolism undergoes dynamic transitions between fatty acid oxidation and fatty acid synthesis as cells progress from naïve to effector and effector to memory T cells. The hydrophobic nature of lipids requires that they be bound to protein chaperones within a cell. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) represent a large class of lipid chaperones, with epidermal FABP (E-FABP) expressed in T cells. The objective of this study was to determine the contribution of E-FABP in antigen-specific T cell responses. Following infection with Listeria monocytogenes, we observed similar clonal expansion, contraction and formation of memory CD8 T cells in WT and E-FABP-/- mice, which also exhibited similar phenotypic and functional characteristics. Analysis of Listeria-specific CD4 T cells also revealed no defect in the expansion, contraction, and formation of memory CD4 T cells in E-FABP-/- mice. These data demonstrate that E-FABP is dispensable for antigen-specific T cell responses following a bacterial infection."
https://openalex.org/W2516050938,"Pulmonary fibrosis represents the terminal stage of a diverse group of lung diseases including scleroderma associated interstitial lung disease. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis are not well understood and there is a great need for more effective treatment for this lethal disease. We recently discovered a small fragment of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor MET as a peptide designated “M10,” with strong antifibrotic properties. Furthermore, we showed that aspartic acid at position 1398 of MET is essential for M10 generation. The current study was undertaken to investigate the D1398G variant of MET in which aspartic acid at position 1398 was mutated to glycine resulting in loss of M10. We demonstrate that lung fibroblasts, A549, and primary alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) expressing D1398G MET exhibit reduced auto-phosphorylation on tyrosine residues and reduced activation of Ras and MAPK. HGF treatment of scleroderma lung fibroblasts as well as HGF treatment of TGFβ-treated normal lung fibroblasts transfected with wild type MET is associated with decreased collagen, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF, CCN2) and smooth muscle α-actin (SMA). However, HGF has no such effects in cells transfected with MET D1398G. Cisplatin- and FasL-induced apoptosis is significantly reduced in AEC transfected with MET wild type, but not in AEC transfected with MET D1398G. We conclude that the D1398G variant of MET is associated with compromised phosphorylation and impaired HGF signaling in lung fibroblasts and AEC, two cell types implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis associated with scleroderma. Ongoing studies will explore the frequency of this variant and its relationship to pulmonary outcomes in scleroderma patients."
