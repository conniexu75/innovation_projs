https://openalex.org/W1986356396,"Cell-free filtrates of axenic or bacterized cultures of the dominant blue-green algae from a freshwater lake inhibited the growth of diatoms isolated from the same lake. Lake waters, collected during blue-green algal blooms, also inhibited diatom growth. In situ observations over a 5-year period indicate that diatom bloom populations vary inversely with the levels of the preceding blue-green algal populations. Blue-green algal dominance of eutrophic lakes is attributed to this allelopathy, and dilution is proposed as one cause for the limited occurrence of blue-green algal dominance in marine waters."

Gravid females, tested at two different temperatures, preferred synthetic mating calls with temperature-dependent temporal properties similar to those produced by a male at about the same temperature as their own. Thus, the vocalization system and the temporal pattern recognition system are affected by temperature in a qualitatively similar fashion."

A 6-hour light period coupled with dark periods of varying duration does not stimulate spermatogenesis in cycle lengths of 24, 48, and 72 hours, but initiates spermatogenesis in cycles of 12, 36, and 60 hours."
https://openalex.org/W2024382634,"Lizard faunas on post-Pleistocene land-bridge islands in the region of Baja California were examined for the effect of island age on species diversity. Species diversity and age are significantly correlated; and when the variation in species diversity attributable to area and latitude are removed, the corrected species diversity plotted against island age produces a relaxation or extinction curve. These results provide evidence for supersaturated faunas which are relaxing to lower levels of species diversity consistent with the equilibrium theory of island biogeography."
https://openalex.org/W2062755254,Delayed leaf senescence has been found in a soybean population which maintains its chlorophyll and ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase activity in leaves and nitrogen fixation (acetylene reduction) activity in root nodules throughout seed maturation. Incorporation of delayed leaf senescence into an agronomically desirable genetic background may help to increase seed yield and symbiotic nitrogen fixation during seed development.

https://openalex.org/W1963875189,"Morphological study of fossil grass anthoecia of Berriochloa and Nassella collected from Miocene-Pliocene strata in Kansas has revealed well-preserved epidermal structure. This seems to be the first micromorphological information known from fossil grass floral bracts. The epidermal pattern on the lemma in the fossils and their living counterparts are evidence in support of the view that the North American species of Stipa of the section Hesperostipa Elias and species of Piptochaetium have a common ancestry in Berriochloa, and that species of both taxa have been distinct from species of the Nassella, Oryzopsis, and other Stipa since at least the Miocene or Pliocene."
https://openalex.org/W2032081132,"A new approach to mixture analysis has been applied to the direct detection of various alkaloids in plant materials. The method requires absolutely no sample treatment. Results are presented for cocaine, morphine, papaverine, coniine, and atropine. The signal-to-background characteristics are superior to those of conventional mass spectrometry. Sensitivity is sufficient to detect and identify between 1 and 10 nanograms of alkaloid."
https://openalex.org/W2012874616,"Lunar laser range measures covering the period 1969 to 1976 have been used to determine the anomalous secular acceleration in the mean longitude of the moon, commonly attributed to the effect of tidal friction in the earth. The acceleration determined is -24.6 +/- 1.6 arc seconds per century squared, against an atomic time scale, where the uncertainty is the formal standard deviation of the solution. The realistic uncertainty is surely larger, as evidenced by the ensemble of solutions performed with various models and observation sets. The determined value is in good agreement with the conventional value and with several recent determinations by other methods. An attempt to determine the rate of change of the mean distance, essential for separating the tidal effect from a time variation of the gravitational constant, yielded no significant result, because the observations still span too short a time."
https://openalex.org/W1964645384,"Planktonic foraminiferal trends across the Miocene-Pliocene boundary in the Philippines suggest that sections of eight deep-sea cores reported to be Pliocene are actually latest Miocene, and that a marked extinction of discoasters in the deep-sea cores is due to an unconformity, separating Miocene and Pleisto-cene sediments, representing a time gap of some 10 million years of Pliocene time."

https://openalex.org/W2052743819,"The grade of copper and nickel in manganese nodules is negatively correlated with their abundance on the sea floor, within small regions and in the Pacific Ocean as a whole. Although the correlation tells nothing about estimates of commercially mineable reserves at particular sites, it contradicts an assumption on which many predictions with respect to manganese nodule resources are based."
https://openalex.org/W2061030874,"Polystyrene, polypropylene, and polyethylene, containing tritiumlabeled additives and crystallized in thin films, were examined with autoradiographic stripping film. In the structures formed by isotactic polystyrene, tritiated atactic polymer concentrated in specific patterns in the outer regions. Polypropylene spherulites showed marked differences in the distribution of the tritiated additive, dilauryl thiodipropionate, whenever their optical properties also differed. Autoradiographs of polyethylene spherulites containing low molecular weight tritiated polyethylene exhibited concentric ring patterns similar to those observed on viewing the polymer film in a polarizing microscope."
https://openalex.org/W2078239975,"Male boll weevils, Anthonomus grandis, held in a light regimen of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness released pheromone rhythmically during the 24 hours. The amount released during peaks was typically 20 times the amount released in valleys. The ratio of the two alcohol components of the pheromone also showed a daily rhythm. Under continuous light, both the release of pheromone and the ratio of the two alcohol components were arrhythmic. In darkness, pheromone release was diminished more than tenfold over the 20-day test period."
https://openalex.org/W2044307297,"The amount of ozone formed in air exposed to a 4000-curie cobalt-60 radiation source was determined. In closed glass containers exposed to about I Mrad of gamma radiation, ozone concentrations up to 18 parts per million (by volume) were recorded. In air flowing through a glass structure placed near the source, ozone contents up to 0.1 parts per million were observed. It is suggested that ozone formation might be a factor in the reported germicidal effects of ionizing radiations and that damage to plant tissues, ascribed to radiation, might have resulted from exposure to ozone. The possible health hazards from the ozone produced during irradiation should not be overlooked."

https://openalex.org/W2165402858,A phosphate glass has been found to have a significant electrode specificity toward alkaline-earth ions. The order of selectivity is 2H(+) > Ba(++) > Sr(++) > Ca(++) > 2K(+) > 2Na(+) > Mg(++). Exchange properties are discussed in relation to possible structure. Its use to determine activity of Ca(++) in natural systems containing Mg(++) is sug gested.

Analyses of combined cell and medium phosphates show a two-and-a-half-fold increase in pyro-phosphate after irradiation while inorganic and total phosphate remain constant."
