In the paper chromatography of dilute and very impure sugar solutions, such as non-diabetic urines or certain protein hydrolysates, it is common practice to use beforehand a ‘mixed bed’ ion-exchange resin to remove interfering anions and cations2. For example, ‘Bio-Deminrolit E’ a mixture of a weakly basic resin containing amine groups and a sulphonic acid type resin, is shaken with the solution for 20 min. and, after centrifuging, the clear supernatant contains all the sugars (except amino-sugars and uronic acids) uncontaminated by ionizable substances3. When ‘Bio-Deminrolit E’ was replaced by ‘Bio-Deminrolit’ or ‘Bio-Deminrolit F’, which are mixtures of sulphonic acid type resins with strongly basic resins of the quaternary ammonium hydroxide type, it was found that all fructose, glucose, galactose, mannose and fucose were removed from the dilute solutions employed."

https://openalex.org/W2078507266,"THE tropical species of Drosophila, D. polymorpha, is polymorphic with regard to the pattern of pigmented abdominal bands. The polymorphism is a case of balanced polymorphism, as shown in a previous paper1. The types are inherited as if caused by two alleles of a single autosomic gene. The dark and the light types are the homozygotes and the intermediate type is the heterozygote. The heterozygote has an adaptive value higher than that of the homozygotes. The heterosis of the intermediate type ensures the maintenance of the two alleles in the populations. The probability that the pigmentation pattern is by itself an adaptive character is very small. Another possibility to be considered is that the two main genes responsible for the pigmentation are associated with other genes through an inversion. The differences in adaptive value could, then, be due to the genes carried in the inversion as a whole."

https://openalex.org/W1975069841,"A BASIC problem in microbiology is that of determining the proportions of live and dead organisms in a bacterial culture. The standard procedure is to spread a known volume of diluted culture over a solid nutrient medium and then, after incubation, to count the colonies which develop. On the assumption that each colony came from one bacterium, the number of viable organisms per millilitre of original culture can be calculated (but not the percentage viability)."

Radioactive samples produced by cyclotron bombardment have been separated in the isotope separator both for obtaining mass assignments and for providing sources for beta-spectroscopic work. Due to the high intensity andhigh energy of the beam available in this cyclotron (200–300 µamp. internal beam of 25-MeV. deuterons), very intense beta-sources of separated isotopes can be obtained. The present communication reports the preliminary results of such an investigation on arsenic-71. The work is still in progress and a more detailed paper will be published later."
https://openalex.org/W2090388821,"IN June 1952 the crew of a fisheries patrol boat cruising in Miramichi Bay, New Brunswick, observed what they took for a sand-bar in an unexpected situation. On closer inspection they found that there was no such bar, but that the surface of the sea over a wide area was in a state of violent turmoil (“a sort of boiling”) due to the presence of enormous numbers of polychætes. The area covered was some 150 yards in radius and was broken up into several minor patches. The largest one, from which they took a sample of the polychætes, was estimated to be 75 ft. long and 15 ft. wide, and the polychætes seemed to extend to about 2 ft. deep. The tide was low at the time and the depth of the water about 7 ft. The bottom consisted of hard mud. The observation was made on a fine, warm day."

The interstices are filled with protofibrils and mucopolysaccharidic acids of high molecular weight. Fibrous connective tissue is produced when lung tissue is degenerated by silica particles, the silicic acid formed by the dissolution of the silica probably being involved, and the possible analogy between the role of silicic acid and that of the mucopolysaccharides is evident."

https://openalex.org/W1977509778,"IN the course of studies on the taxonomy of Coleoptera, lasting many years and dealing with groups at all levels from sub-orders down to species, it has gradually been borne upon me that taxonomic groups are not usually to be distinguished from the nearest related ones by more than one really constant character. Expressing the same concept in another form, if a taxonomic group is distinguished from related ones by the possession of character A, its constitution will not be quite the same as it would be if it were defined by the possession of character B. From superficial observation, the same principle appears to hold very generally in the animal kingdom, and quite probably among plants as well. Though this circumstance may well be familiar to many taxonomists, it does not appear to have been explicitly recognized as a general principle hitherto; if it is ultimately considered worthy of a name, I suggest ‘the non-congruence principle’."

https://openalex.org/W1972659128,"THYMUS and thymus extracts have been reported by Asher1, Rowntree, Clark and Hanson2, and others using rats as test animals, to have a growth-stimulating effect. Later experiments did not confirm this observation3,4. The conflicting results may have been due to deficient diet given to the control animals of the earlier investigators4, or to the varying value of the calf thymus extracts used. No generally accepted explanation, however, has been found for the growth results. Hammar5 was of the opinion that some vitamin of the B group may be a contributing factor."
