https://openalex.org/W2901209536,"Gene expression is controlled by transcription factors (TFs) that consist of DNA-binding domains (DBDs) and activation domains (ADs). The DBDs have been well characterized, but little is known about the mechanisms by which ADs effect gene activation. Here, we report that diverse ADs form phase-separated condensates with the Mediator coactivator. For the OCT4 and GCN4 TFs, we show that the ability to form phase-separated droplets with Mediator in vitro and the ability to activate genes in vivo are dependent on the same amino acid residues. For the estrogen receptor (ER), a ligand-dependent activator, we show that estrogen enhances phase separation with Mediator, again linking phase separation with gene activation. These results suggest that diverse TFs can interact with Mediator through the phase-separating capacity of their ADs and that formation of condensates with Mediator is involved in gene activation."

To address this gap, the DICE (database of immune cell expression, expression quantitative trait loci [eQTLs], and epigenomics) project was established. Considering all human immune cell types and conditions studied, we identified cis-eQTLs for a total of 12,254 unique genes, which represent 61% of all protein-coding genes expressed in these cell types. Strikingly, a large fraction (41%) of these genes showed a strong cis-association with genotype only in a single cell type. We also found that biological sex is associated with major differences in immune cell gene expression in a highly cell-specific manner. These datasets will help reveal the effects of disease risk-associated genetic polymorphisms on specific immune cell types, providing mechanistic insights into how they might influence pathogenesis (https://dice-database.org).

Genomic surveys of individuals from multiple populations have revealed significant genetic heterogeneity, with over 80 million autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including ∼8 million common variants (Auton et al., 2015Auton A. Brooks L.D. Durbin R.M. Garrison E.P. Kang H.M. Korbel J.O. Marchini J.L. McCarthy S. McVean G.A. Abecasis G.R.; 1000 Genomes Project ConsortiumA global reference for human genetic variation.Nature. 2015; 526: 68-74Google Scholar). Disease risk associations for several thousand of these SNPs have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (Visscher et al., 2012Visscher P.M. Brown M.A. McCarthy M.I. Yang J. Five years of GWAS discovery.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2012; 90: 7-24Google Scholar); however, the overwhelming majority of GWAS hits lie in non-coding regions of the genome, and thus, very little is known about exactly which genes they effect, in which cell types they act, and what their functional relevance is to disease. In parallel, large-scale epigenomic initiatives analyzing multiple human cell types have attributed cis-regulatory function to nearly 20% of the non-coding DNA sequences and showed that disease risk variants are enriched in cell-specific cis-regulatory DNA sequences (Kundaje et al., 2015Kundaje A. Meuleman W. Ernst J. Bilenky M. Yen A. Heravi-Moussavi A. Kheradpour P. Zhang Z. Wang J. Ziller M.J. et al.Roadmap Epigenomics ConsortiumIntegrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes.Nature. 2015; 518: 317-330Google Scholar). This indicates that disease risk variants are likely to affect gene expression in a context-dependent manner, in a specific subset of cell types in the human body. Defining the cell types in which disease risk variants modulate gene expression will aid mechanistic and functional studies that investigate the genetic basis of specific diseases. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium assessed the association of genetic variants with gene expression levels (expression quantitative trait loci or eQTLs) across 44 human tissues (GTEx Consortium, 2015GTEx ConsortiumHuman genomics.

Its results provide a valuable resource for narrowing down tissue-specific cis-regulatory effects of disease risk variants, but the results do not provide information on eQTLs in immune cell types.

The DICE (database of immune cell expression, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and epigenomics) project was established to define the transcriptional and epigenomic landscape of many human immune cell types in relation to genetic variation, thereby identifying both the cell-type restriction and potential function of human disease-associated SNPs. In this first report from the DICE project, we identified common genetic variants that are associated with the expression of several thousand protein-coding and non-coding RNAs in 13 types of immune cells and 2 activation conditions, providing a map as to how human genetic variations affect gene expression in immune cell types. We have built a central resource (https://dice-database.org) to integrate and disseminate our datasets and to allow scientists to predict the effects of disease-associated genetic variants in immune cell types, thus connecting the genetic risk of disease to cell types and molecular pathways. In the first phase of the DICE project, we present transcriptomic data generated from 13 immune cell types isolated from 106 leukapheresis samples provided by 91 healthy subjects, including 15 who provided longitudinal samples. The cell types presented here comprise over 60% of all circulating mononuclear cells and include three innate immune cell types (CD14high CD16— classical monocytes, CD14— CD16+ non-classical monocytes, CD56dim CD16+ NK cells), four adaptive immune cell types that have not encountered cognate antigen in the periphery (naive B cells, naive CD4+ T cells, naive CD8+ T cells, and naive regulatory T cells [TREG]), six CD4+ memory or more differentiated T cell subsets (TH1, TH1/17, TH17, TH2, follicular helper T cell [TFH], and memory TREG), and two activated cell types (naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that were stimulated ex vivo) (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1A–S1F and Table S1).Figure S1Sorting Strategies, Immune Cell Types Isolated, and Additional Data for RNA-Seq Analysis, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A–D) Representative FACS plots describing the sorting strategies used for the isolation of the indicated immune cell types using four different FACS panels from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).(E) Surface markers used for isolation of the indicated cell types (details in Table S6A).(F) Relative proportions of the indicated immune cell populations in PBMC samples (n = 91 each); each symbol represents an individual subject.(G) RNA-seq analysis of 1,544 samples (details in Table S1B) showing the total number of detected protein-coding transcripts and lncRNAs categorized based on their mean expression levels (TPM, transcript per million) in the indicated cell types and activation conditions.(H) The pie charts show the relative cell specificity of the expressed transcripts, globally (left) and according to the biotype as defined in the Ensembl database.(I) Overlap of all expressed transcripts identified across cell types and conditions (n = 15).

(I) Overlap of all expressed transcripts identified across cell types and conditions (n = 15). The bar graph shows the fraction of transcripts identified per cell type. RNA-seq analysis showed that similar numbers of transcripts (ranging from 14,500–17,000, ∼39% of all annotated transcripts) were detected (> 1.0 transcripts per million, TPM) across all cell types and activation conditions (Figure 1C). About 18% of these transcripts were long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) (Figure 1D), which as a class were expressed at lower levels compared to protein-coding transcripts (Figure S1G). Though a majority of transcripts were detected in multiple cell types (Figures S1H and S1I), their relative abundance varied substantially, resulting in distinct clustering patterns of different cell types (Figure 1E). We classified the differentially expressed transcripts into groups that had significantly higher expression in one cell type than in the others (Figure 2 and Table S2). 4,602 transcripts showed highly cell-specific expression patterns (Figure 2A) and were classified as cell-specific protein-coding transcripts, including several whose function is well-known (CD163, SIGLEC10, GZMB, FCRL2, CD40LG, and CRTAM) and others where it is still poorly defined in the respective cell type (PADI4, CLEC4F, C1orf21, TSPAN13, and FHIT) (Figures 2A and 2B). Interestingly, several lncRNAs showed high abundance in specific immune cell types. Though very little is known about their function, the cell specificity of their expression raises the speculation that these lncRNAs may have an important role in the development and/or function of the respective immune cell type. Differential gene expression analysis among the CD4+ T cell subsets revealed over 700 genes that were enriched for expression in one specific CD4+ T cell subset (Figure 2C). Besides known CD4+ T cell subset-specific genes (e.g., FOXP3 in TREG cells, IL17A in TH17 cells, CXCR5 in TFH cells), several novel protein-coding transcripts and lncRNAs (e.g., RP11-265P11.2 in naive TREG cells, AP001189.4 in memory TREG cells, GPR56 in TH1 cells, TNFRSF11A in TH2 cells), whose function has not been fully characterized, with cell-specific expression patterns in CD4+ T cell subsets were identified (Figures 2C and 2D). Overall, these findings emphasize the value of this resource in defining a reference for cell-specific transcripts, several of which may have important functional roles in the respective cell types. We identified common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with variation in transcript abundance of a nearby gene, which we refer to as cis-eQTLs for convenience. Considering all immune cell types and including differences related to activation of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, we identified cis-eQTLs for a total of 12,254 unique genes, representing 61% of all expressed protein-coding genes and 49% of all lncRNAs, respectively, and a majority of these were replicated in other eQTL studies (Figure 3A and Table S3). For simplicity, genes with at least one significant cis-eQTL in any cell type are hereafter referred to as eGenes. The cis-eQTLs were enriched within intronic regions of the genome (Figure 3B) and 12% of all cis-eQTLs were located within ± 10 kb of the TSS (Figure 3C). However, 37% of all cis-eQTLs were located >100 kb from the TSS of the target gene (Figure 3C), suggesting that genetic variants may correlate with expression of more distant target genes. We identified >2,000 eGenes (ranging from 2,421–3,590 eGenes per cell type) for each of the indicated six common cell types (Figure 3D), and the majority (51%) of these genes showed a significant cis-association with genotype only in one specific cell type (Figures 3E–3G). The cell specificity of SNPs’ association was not entirely due to cell-specific expression of eGenes, as these associations were observed even for genes that were expressed at similar levels across multiple cell types, with some cell types highly susceptible to the effect of the SNP and others not susceptible (Figures 3F, 3G, and S2A). For example, IRAK3 showed a peak cis-eQTL (rs1732886, adj. association p = 6.82 × 10−17) only in naive B cells even though it was expressed at even higher levels in classical and non-classical monocytes (Figure 3G). IRAK3 is a member of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase family and known to function as a negative regulator of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling regulating immune homeostasis and tolerance (Hubbard and Moore, 2010Hubbard L.L. Moore B.B. IRAK-M regulation and function in host defense and immune homeostasis.Infect. Dis. Rep. 2010; 2Google Scholar). Additional examples of cell-specific eGenes that we identified include two genes in the CD96 locus that showed strong cis-eQTLs exclusively in naive B cells (rs149612031, adj. association p = 3.01 × 10−16 for CD96 and 1.81 × 10−16 for ZBED2, respectively; Figures 3G and S2A). Homozygosity of the GA allele of rs149612031 (64% of our subjects) was associated with lack of expression of the CD96 and ZBED2 transcripts in B cells, but not in other cell types such as NK cells and T cells, suggesting that these genetic variants, if causally linked to gene expression, profoundly affect only susceptible cell types. CD96 belongs to the immunoglobulin family of receptors that bind to nectin-like proteins and is expressed by NK cells and T cells where it functions as an important negative regulator of cellular activation and cytokine responses (Chan et al., 2014Chan C.J. Martinet L. Gilfillan S. Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes F. Chow M.T. Town L. Ritchie D.S. Colonna M. Andrews D.M. Smyth M.J. The receptors CD96 and CD226 oppose each other in the regulation of natural killer cell functions.Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15: 431-438Google Scholar); ZBED2 is a transcription factor. An interesting eQTL (rs2511162) associated with GAB2 showed inverse effects on gene expression in B cells versus T cells; rs2511162A/A was associated with lower GAB2 expression in B cells, whereas in T cells, it was associated with increased expression of GAB2. Knocking down GAB2 expression in naive CD4+ T cells resulted in a significant reduction in the expression of activation markers (CD69, CD25, and HLA-DR) and cytokine transcripts (IFNG and IL2) following anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation (Figures S2B–S2D). GAB2 has previously been shown to be an important adaptor protein involved in B and T cell signaling pathways (Osinalde et al., 2016Osinalde N. Sánchez-Quiles V. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Changes in Gab2 phosphorylation and interaction partners in response to interleukin (IL)-2 stimulation in T-lymphocytes.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 23530Google Scholar); thus, if this genetic variant modulates GAB2 protein expression, there could be divergent functional consequences in T cells and in B cells. A ∼240 kb dense haploblock of NK cell- and CD8+ T cell-specific cis-eQTLs at the 12p13.2 locus was associated with the expression of three lncRNAs and six C-type lectin-like receptors, including 5 activating NK receptors (KLRK1, KLRC4-KLRK1, KLRC4, KLRC3, and KLRC2) and an inhibitory receptor (KLRC1) (Figure 3H, top panel). Non-coding SNPs in general have previously been shown to perturb the function of cell-specific enhancers and thus affect gene expression in specific cell types (Schmiedel et al., 2016Schmiedel B.J. Seumois G. Samaniego-Castruita D. Cayford J. Schulten V. Chavez L. Ay F. Sette A. Peters B. Vijayanand P. 17q21 asthma-risk variants switch CTCF binding and regulate IL-2 production by T cells.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 13426Google Scholar). As expected, several of the cis-eQTLs in the 12p13.2 locus directly overlapped many cell-specific DNase sites present in NK cells and naive CD8+ T cells (Figure 3H, middle panel). The G allele at rs2927561 was associated with increased expression of all five activating NK receptors and two lncRNAs in the locus, which suggested that this allele, if causally linked to gene expression, is likely to confer NK cells with an enhanced activation potential (Figures 3G and 3H, bottom panel). Given the importance of NK cells in anti-viral and tumor immunity, it would be interesting to test whether the 12p13.2 genetic variants that correlate with expression of an important group of NK receptors could have donor-specific consequences. Previous studies have reported that several genetic variants are associated with gene expression only following perturbation of resting immune cells by relevant environmental (extrinsic) stimuli (Fairfax et al., 2014Fairfax B.P. Humburg P. Makino S. Naranbhai V. Wong D. Lau E. Jostins L. Plant K. Andrews R. McGee C. Knight J.C. Innate immune activity conditions the effect of regulatory variants upon monocyte gene expression.Science. 2014; 343: 1246949Google Scholar, Lee et al., 2014Lee M.N. Ye C. Villani A.C. Raj T. Li W.

Slowikowski K. et al.Common genetic variants modulate pathogen-sensing responses in human dendritic cells.Science. 2014; 343: 1246980Google Scholar). To uncover such environment-responsive cis-eQTLs, we activated naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells ex vivo and analyzed the association of SNPs with gene expression in an activation-induced manner. We identified additional cis-eQTLs for >1,300 genes exclusively in activated naive CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells (Figure 3I and Table S3A). These activation-induced eQTLs were associated with several genes encoding products known to influence T cell function, such as, the immune checkpoint molecule PDCD1 (PD-1) (Keir et al., 2008Keir M.E. Butte M.J. Freeman G.J. Sharpe A.H. PD-1 and its ligands in tolerance and immunity.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 677-704Google Scholar), the co-stimulatory molecule TNFRSF9 (4-1BB) (Watts, 2005Watts T.H. TNF/TNFR family members in costimulation of T cell responses.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 23-68Google Scholar), the co-inhibitory molecule CD59 (Sivasankar et al., 2009Sivasankar B. Longhi M.P. Gallagher K.M. Betts G.J. Morgan B.P. Godkin A.J. Gallimore A.M. CD59 blockade enhances antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses in humans: a new target for cancer immunotherapy?.J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 5203-5207Google Scholar) and SGK1 (Wu et al., 2013Wu C. Yosef N. Thalhamer T. Zhu C. Xiao S. Kishi Y. Regev A. Kuchroo V.K. Induction of pathogenic TH17 cells by inducible salt-sensing kinase SGK1.Nature. 2013; 496: 513-517Google Scholar), a kinase that regulates differentiation of TH17 and TH2 cells (Figure 3J and Figure S2E). In a time course experiment, we confirmed that following activation, a greater proportion of CD4+ T cells expressed cell surface 4-1BB protein in subjects with the TNFRSF9 (4-1BB) expression-increasing allele (T/T genotype at rs9657975) compared to those with C/C genotype (Figure 3K). This effect was not observed for other markers of activation such as CD69, CD25 or HLA-DR (Figure 3K and Figure S2F), which suggested that despite similar levels of activation, 4-1BB protein expression differed based on genotype. Since 4-1BB is currently tested as a co-stimulatory cancer immunotherapy target (Chester et al., 2018Chester C. Sanmamed M.F. Wang J. Melero I. Immunotherapy targeting 4-1BB: mechanistic rationale, clinical results, and future strategies.Blood. 2018; 131: 49-57Google Scholar), our description of genotype-dependent effects on expression of 4-1BB in T cells may aid in the development of genetic biomarkers that stratify potential responders to 4-1BB targeted therapies. Naive CD4+ T cells when activated in vivo following pathogen exposure, differentiate into several lineage-specific memory subsets such as TH1, TH1/17, TH17, TH2, and TFH subsets (Zhou et al., 2009Zhou L. Chong M.M. Littman D.R. Plasticity of CD4+ T cell lineage differentiation.Immunity. 2009; 30: 646-655Google Scholar), which have distinct gene expression programs and functional roles in host defense (Figure 2C). Naive TREG cells are another important CD4+ T cell lineage that develops in the thymus and differentiates into memory TREG cells in the periphery where they play an immune regulatory role (Sakaguchi et al., 2010Sakaguchi S. Miyara M. Costantino C.M. Hafler D.A. FOXP3+ regulatory T cells in the human immune system.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 490-500Google Scholar). Our eQTL analysis of CD4+ memory and TREG subsets yielded over 7,800 eGenes, of which >2,500 were unique to these subsets (Figure 4A). Further, we identified >2,000 eGenes (ranging from 2,381–3,560 eGenes per cell type, Figure 4B) for each of the eight CD4+ T cell subsets, and a large proportion (44%) of these genes showed a significant cis-association with genotype only in one cell type (Figures 4C and 4D). A noteworthy example of an eGene specific to the CD4+ memory and TREG subsets was ENTPD1 that encodes for CD39, a cell-surface ectonucleotidase, which has been widely considered to play a role in the generation of immunosuppressive microenvironments through adenosine production from ATP (Takenaka et al., 2016Takenaka M.C. Robson S. Quintana F.J. Regulation of the T Cell Response by CD39.Trends Immunol. 2016; 37: 427-439Google Scholar). Several other eGenes showed highly cell-type-restricted effects (Figure 4E); for example, CCNG2, encoding for a cell cycle protein, cyclin G2, showed a peak eQTL (rs4859751) specifically in TH1/17 and TH17 cells although it was also highly expressed in other TH subsets and immune cell types; whereas NCF4, which encodes neutrophilic cytosolic factor 4, a component of the NADPH oxidase complex, showed prominent cis-QTLs specifically in CD4+ T subsets (Figure 4E). We also identified two genes in the Fc receptor like (FCRL) gene locus that showed strong cis-eQTLs primarily in TREG subsets (rs2065883, adj. association p = 5.6 × 10−18 for FCRL1 and 3.8 × 10−18 for FCRL2 and 1.81 × 10−16 in naive TREG cells, respectively; Figure 4E). The function of FCRL1 and FCRL2 in TREG cells is not known, but given its role in modulating B cell receptor signaling pathway in B cell subsets (Li et al., 2014Li F.J. Won W.J. Becker Jr., E.J. Easlick J.L. Tabengwa E.M. Li R. Shakhmatov M. Honjo K. Burrows P.D. Davis R.S. Emerging roles for the FCRL family members in lymphocyte biology and disease.Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Update on Fc receptor-like (FCRL) family: new immunoregulatory players in health and diseases.Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2018; 22: 487-502Google Scholar), where it is highly expressed, it is conceivable that these proteins may module TREG activation and function in a genotype dependent manner. Our data emphasize the importance of studying purified, homogeneous cell types to identify cells and genes most susceptible to the effects of genetic variants. It will also be important to confirm directly that the SNPs indeed affect the biological functions of the corresponding cell types, using appropriate experimental systems of development or activation. To shed light on the disease relevance of the eQTLs identified in human immune cells, we next focused on the subset of eGenes linked to eQTLs that directly overlapped haploblocks of significant GWAS SNPs (PGWAS < 5 × 10−8) that were associated with one or more of 846 unique human diseases and traits (Table S4 and STAR Methods). Most importantly, about 19% of all the eGenes identified in each human immune cell type (2,297 unique GWAS eGenes; 599–987 eGenes per cell type) were also associated with GWAS SNPs (Figures 5A and 5B ), and for about 36% of the eGenes, associations were observed in only one or two cell types (Figure S3A). Together, these results suggest that disease risk alleles may have a profound impact on immune cell gene expression and that their effects may be highly restricted to specific cell types.Figure S3Cell Types Most Susceptible to GWAS SNPs and Role of GWAS eGenes in Cellular Functions, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A) Overlap of GWAS eGenes across all cell types and activation conditions (n = 15).

Here, we describe N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) as an mRNA modification that is catalyzed by the acetyltransferase NAT10. Transcriptome-wide mapping of ac4C revealed discretely acetylated regions that were enriched within coding sequences. Ablation of NAT10 reduced ac4C detection at the mapped mRNA sites and was globally associated with target mRNA downregulation. Analysis of mRNA half-lives revealed a NAT10-dependent increase in stability in the cohort of acetylated mRNAs. mRNA acetylation was further demonstrated to enhance substrate translation in vitro and in vivo. Codon content analysis within ac4C peaks uncovered a biased representation of cytidine within wobble sites that was empirically determined to influence mRNA decoding efficiency. These findings expand the repertoire of mRNA modifications to include an acetylated residue and establish a role for ac4C in the regulation of mRNA translation.

Analogous to the widely studied epigenome, generation of the “epitranscriptome” through chemical modification of ribonucleosides expands the regulatory content intrinsic within mRNAs (Roundtree et al., 2017Roundtree I.A. Evans M.E. Pan T. He C. Dynamic RNA modifications in gene expression regulation.Cell. 2017; 169: 1187-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Occurring in all four nucleobases, over 140 ribonucleoside modifications have been reported in prokarya, archaea, and eukarya (Boccaletto et al., 2018Boccaletto P. Machnicka M.A. Purta E.

While the multiplicity of modified residues in RNA implies regulatory potential, limited availability of reagents and poor mechanistic knowledge pose substantial obstacles to comprehensive surveys. To date, most studies have focused on detailed examination of abundant tRNAs and rRNAs. In contrast, modifications within mRNAs remain poorly understood. Where examined, mRNA modifications have been demonstrated to influence posttranscriptional metabolism through the regulation of mRNA stability, processing, and/or translation (Roundtree et al., 2017Roundtree I.A. Evans M.E. Pan T. He C. Dynamic RNA modifications in gene expression regulation.Cell. 2017; 169: 1187-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Focusing solely on cytidine, eleven base modifications have been detected in RNA, three of which are conserved in all domains of life: 5-methylcytidine (m5C), 5-hydroxymethylcytidine (hm5C), and N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) (Boccaletto et al., 2018Boccaletto P. Machnicka M.A. Purta E. Piatkowski P. Baginski B. Wirecki T.K. de Crécy-Lagard V. Ross R. Limbach P.A.

Among these, direct analogs of m5C and hm5C are found in DNA, and studies into their regulation, distribution, and function in RNA have been facilitated through existing knowledge of DNA methylation (Delatte et al., 2016Delatte B.

In contrast, ac4C remains relatively unexplored. Initially described in the bacterial tRNAmet anticodon (Stern and Schulman, 1978Stern L. Schulman L.H. The role of the minor base N4-acetylcytidine in the function of the Escherichia coli noninitiator methionine transfer RNA.J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6132-6139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ac4C was subsequently detected in eukaryotic serine and leucine tRNAs and 18S rRNA (Boccaletto et al., 2018Boccaletto P. Machnicka M.A. Purta E. Piatkowski P. Baginski B. Wirecki T.K. de Crécy-Lagard V. Ross R. Limbach P.A.

In all cases, ac4C production has been catalyzed by the N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) enzyme or its homologs (Chimnaronk et al., 2009Chimnaronk S. Suzuki T. Manita T. Ikeuchi Y. Yao M. Suzuki T.

Suggestive of a non-redundant relationship, ac4C is the sole acetylation event to have been described in eukaryotic RNA and NAT10 is the singular human enzyme to have both acetyltransferase and RNA binding activities (Figure S1A) (Ito et al., 2014Ito S. Horikawa S. Suzuki T. Kawauchi H. Tanaka Y. Suzuki T. Suzuki T. Human NAT10 is an ATP-dependent RNA acetyltransferase responsible for N4-acetylcytidine formation in 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA).J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 35724-35730Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recently, unbiased mass spectrometry (MS) studies raised the possibility that the NAT10/ac4C axis extends to polyadenylated (poly(A)) RNAs: proteomic characterization of the mRNA-interactome revealed NAT10 as a poly(A)-interacting factor, and ac4C was consistently detected in liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS of poly(A) RNA isolated from a variety of human cell types at a level comparable to the 5′ 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap (Castello et al., 2012Castello A. Fischer B. Eichelbaum K. Horos R. Beckmann B.M. Strein C. Davey N.E. Humphreys D.T. Preiss T.

Commun. 2016; 476: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggested that ac4C exists within mRNA at physiologically relevant levels. Here, we utilize transcriptome-wide approaches to investigate ac4C localization and function in mRNA. We find that ac4C is widely distributed within the human transcriptome with a majority of sites occurring within coding sequences (CDS). Disruption of the NAT10 gene ablated ac4C detection at mapped mRNA sites and revealed a role for acetylation in promoting target gene expression through improved mRNA stability and translation. Bioinformatic analysis of codon composition within ac4C peaks further demonstrated a strong enrichment for cytidine specifically within wobble sites. Notably, ac4C results in increased thermal stability upon Watson-Crick base-pairing with guanosine as compared to unmodified cytosine (Kumbhar et al., 2013Kumbhar B.V. Kamble A.D. Sonawane K.D. Conformational preferences of modified nucleoside N(4)-acetylcytidine, ac4C occur at “wobble” 34th position in the anticodon loop of tRNA.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 66: 797-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and may thus influence interaction with cognate tRNAs during translation. In support of such a role, translation of acetylated reporter mRNAs was robustly stimulated, both in vitro and in vivo, particularly when ac4C was present at wobble positions. In sum, we describe ac4C as a component of the epitranscriptome that functions in the regulation of mRNA expression through enhanced stability and translation, potentially at the level of decoding efficiency. Analysis of RNA modifications can be hampered by poor knowledge or redundancy of the responsible enzyme(s). Based on the unique architecture of the NAT10 enzyme and the singular occurrence of acetylation within eukaryotic RNA, we hypothesized that NAT10 is the main source of ac4C in human cells (Figure 1A). To investigate this possibility, we genetically ablated NAT10 in HeLa cells. Of the 29 exons in NAT10, only exon 5 is utilized in all coding isoforms (Figure S1A). We thus pursued cleavage-directed frameshift mutations against NAT10 exon 5. Genomic sequencing revealed preferential selection for adenine insertion at one allele, coupled to distinct fates at the second allele (out-of-frame deletion, in-frame deletion, and adenine insertion for NAT10−/− clones A–C, respectively) (Figure S1B). In addition, a HeLa clone that was transfected with guide RNA but failed to show NAT10 mutation was selected as a NAT10+/+ control. Western blot and immunofluorescence in the CRISPR-Cas9-generated clones revealed effective loss of NAT10 expression (Figures 1B and 1C). However, consistent with its description as an essential gene in yeast (Sharma et al., 2015Sharma S. Langhendries J.L. Watzinger P. Kötter P. Entian K.D. Lafontaine D.L. Yeast Kre33 and human NAT10 are conserved 18S rRNA cytosine acetyltransferases that modify tRNAs assisted by the adaptor Tan1/THUMPD1.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: 2242-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), minor residual protein was observed that was attributed to low efficiency skipping of exon 5 (Figures 1C and S1C). Characterization of NAT10−/− cells revealed high viability but reduced proliferation kinetics and an increase in the fraction of cells in G2/M as compared to wild-type HeLa (Figures 1D, 1E, S1D, and S1E). High-throughput sequencing of total RNA from wild-type and NAT10−/− HeLa cells showed strong concordance between replicates and identified 3,954 protein coding genes that were differentially expressed upon NAT10 ablation (Figures 1F and S1F; Tables S1 and S2). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the altered genes revealed a strong enrichment for cell survival and proliferation, providing a rationale for the observed phenotype (Figure 1G; Table S2). To explore the involvement of NAT10 in catalyzing RNA acetylation in HeLa cells, we performed LC-MS for ac4C in total RNA. Relative quantification against isotopically labeled internal standards (D3-ac4C, 15N3-C) revealed a substantial loss of ac4C in total RNA from NAT10−/− clones, as compared to parental HeLa and the NAT10+/+ control (Figure 1H). Independently performed LC-MS/MS for quantification at attomole sensitivity (Basanta-Sanchez et al., 2016Basanta-Sanchez M. Temple S. Ansari S.A. D’Amico A. Agris P.F. Attomole quantification and global profile of RNA modifications: Epitranscriptome of human neural stem cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: e26Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) indicated a similar fold reduction for NAT10−/− clone A as compared to parental HeLa (Figure S1G), thereby demonstrating the validity of the LC-MS approach. Based on these findings, NAT10−/− clones A and B, which yielded an ∼80%–90% reduction in ac4C (Figure 1H), were selected for downstream studies. Consistent with the LC-MS results, dot blot using monoclonal antibody against ac4C (Sinclair et al., 2017Sinclair W.R. Arango D. Shrimp J.H. Zengeya T.T. Thomas J.M. Montgomery D.C. Fox S.D. Andresson T. Oberdoerffer S. Meier J.L. Profiling cytidine acetylation with specific affinity and reactivity.ACS Chem. Biol. 2017; 12: 2922-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Figure S1H) demonstrated a near complete loss of signal in total RNA from clones A and B relative to control (Figures 1I and 1J). Likewise, anti-ac4C immuno-northern blot showed abundant signal in regions corresponding to 18S rRNA and tRNA species that was ablated in the NAT10−/− clones (Figure 1K). Immuno-northern additionally revealed a preponderance of NAT10-dependent acetylated species occurring in the size range expected to contain poly(A) RNAs, thus supporting the premise that NAT10 activity extends beyond rRNA and tRNA (Figure 1K). Importantly, re-expression of NAT10 cDNA in NAT10−/− clone A effectively reconstituted ac4C in total RNA thereby establishing NAT10 as a bona fide RNA acetyltransferase in HeLa cells (Figure S1I). Of note, NAT10 was previously described as a protein acetyltransferase with demonstrated activities against α-tubulin, histones, and p53 (Larrieu et al., 2014Larrieu D. Britton S. Demir M.

NAT10, a nucleolar protein, localizes to the midbody and regulates cytokinesis and acetylation of microtubules.Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 1653-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast to the dramatic reduction observed in ac4C levels, immunoblotting with acetyl-specific antibodies showed little change in protein acetylation in NAT10−/− as compared to wild-type HeLa cells (Figure S1J). Likewise, re-expression of NAT10 in clone A did not impact acetylation of established protein substrates (Figure S1K). To reconcile our results with previous reports, we explored generality through CRISPR-Cas9-directed NAT10 inactivation in Flp-In T-Rex 293 cells. As in HeLa, immunoblot revealed a considerable decrease in ac4C upon NAT10 ablation that was efficiently restored upon single copy integration of full-length NAT10 cDNA, but not NAT10 lacking the RNA helicase domain (Figures S1L and S1M). In contrast, acetylated α-tubulin levels remained stable upon NAT10 modulation (Figure S1N). Of relevance, initial investigations into NAT10 protein-acetyltransferase activity largely focused on an isoform that lacks the N-terminal RNA-interacting region (Lv et al., 2003Lv J. Liu H. Wang Q. Tang Z. Hou L. Zhang B. Molecular cloning of a novel human gene encoding histone acetyltransferase-like protein involved in transcriptional activation of hTERT.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 506-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, Shen et al., 2009Shen Q. Zheng X. McNutt M.A. Guang L. Sun Y. Wang J. Gong Y. Hou L. Zhang B. NAT10, a nucleolar protein, localizes to the midbody and regulates cytokinesis and acetylation of microtubules.Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 1653-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), whereas HeLa and 293 cells uniformly express full-length NAT10. Together, these findings point to RNA as the preferred substrate for full-length NAT10 and suggest that NAT10 protein acetyltransferase activity is regulated in a cell-type-specific manner through the production of isoforms that lack critical RNA binding determinants. Overall, these results solidify NAT10 as the principal source for RNA acetylation in human cells. To gain direct evidence for ac4C within poly(A) RNA, oligo(dT)-purified RNA was isolated from parental HeLa cells for determination of ac4C levels. Poly(A) enrichment was confirmed through reduced detection of 18S rRNA relative to total RNA in reverse transcription followed by quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (Figure 2A) and bioanalyzer analysis (Figure S2A). ac4C levels were examined in the purified poly(A) RNA through dot blot and LC-MS/MS. Both techniques detected substantial ac4C in the poly(A) RNA that was estimated to be ∼40% the level in total RNA (Figures 2B, 2C, and S2B). Given the near 1,000× reduction in 18S rRNA relative to GAPDH mRNA in the poly(A) preparation (Figure 2A), identification of ac4C in HeLa poly(A) RNA is inconsistent with abundant rRNA contamination and instead points to a bona fide presence in poly(A) RNA. To further explore the dependency on NAT10, poly(A) samples from parental and NAT10−/− clone A were subjected to LC/MS with isotopically labeled internal standards (Figure 2D). Consistent with the extent of ablation in total RNA, ac4C levels in poly(A) RNA from clone A were reduced ∼90% (Figure 2E). Finally, immuno-northern blot in poly(A) RNA established that the “unknown” signal observed in total RNA (Figure 1K) derives from polyadenylated species and confirmed NAT10 dependency through loss of signal in the NAT10−/− clones (Figure 2F). Importantly, northern blot with probe against 18S rRNA shows that the observed ac4C smear does not emanate from contaminating 18S rRNA degradation products (Figure 2F). The sum of these analyses performed in HeLa RNA strongly support the presence of NAT10-dependent ac4C in poly(A) RNA.Figure S2Characterization of ac4C Levels in Poly(A) RNA, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Poly(A) RNA was isolated using two rounds of oligo(dT)25 beads and purity verified through size distribution in bioanalyzer profiling.(B) Chromatograms are representative of LC-MS/MS performed in total and poly(A) RNA from parental HeLa cells.

(B) Chromatograms are representative of LC-MS/MS performed in total and poly(A) RNA from parental HeLa cells. Blank and ac4C standards were included as controls. We next pursued transcriptome-wide mapping to solidify the occurrence of ac4C within protein-coding mRNAs (Figure 3A). Since RNA mapping strategies typically rely on conversion to cDNA and select modifications negatively impact this step (Hauenschild et al., 2015Hauenschild R. Tserovski L. Schmid K. Thüring K. Winz M.L. Sharma S. Entian K.D. Wacheul L. Lafontaine D.L. Anderson J. et al.The reverse transcription signature of N-1-methyladenosine in RNA-Seq is sequence dependent.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: 9950-9964PubMed Google Scholar), we first assessed the behavior of acetylated RNA in reverse transcription. To generate substrates of known acetylation status, plasmid encoding mouse β-globin RNA was in vitro transcribed in the presence of unmodified CTP or ac4CTP (Figure 3B). Stable ac4C incorporation was validated through dot blot with anti-ac4C antibody (Figure S1H). Reverse transcription of the in vitro-transcribed probes using gene-specific radiolabeled primer showed efficient generation of full-length cDNA from both the acetylated and unmodified probes, thus confirming that ac4C is amenable to cDNA-based sequencing methods (Figure 3B). The in vitro-transcribed probes further facilitated examination of ac4C immunoprecipitation (IP) efficiency. Acetylated and unmodified β-globin probes were spiked into HeLa total RNA at varying concentrations and RNA IP was performed with anti-ac4C antibody (acetylated RNA immunoprecipitation or acRIP). Subsequent RT-qPCR confirmed linear recovery of acetylated β-globin RNA (Figure 3C). To additionally assess acRIP functionality within the complex modification landscape of cellular RNAs, we investigated 18S rRNA recovery in parental versus NAT10−/− HeLa cells. Human 18S rRNA possesses two acetylated sites, existing in helices 34 and 45, the latter of which occurs at near 100% stoichiometry (Taoka et al., 2018Taoka M. Nobe Y. Yamaki Y. Sato K. Ishikawa H. Izumikawa K. Yamauchi Y. Hirota K. Nakayama H. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Landscape of the complete RNA chemical modifications in the human 80S ribosome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 9289-9298Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Accordingly, acRIP in fragmented total RNA and RT-qPCR directed near helix 45 showed strong ablation of 18S recovery in NAT10−/− cells as compared to control (Figure S3A). In contrast, the abundant non-acetylated 28S and 5S rRNAs were not recovered (Figure S3A). Given that 28S rRNA directly base pairs with 18S rRNA in vivo (Khatter et al., 2015Khatter H. Myasnikov A.G. Natchiar S.K. Klaholz B.P. Structure of the human 80S ribosome.Nature. 2015; 520: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), this demonstration establishes that downstream results are not an artifact of 18S rRNA co-purification. Together, these findings support the technical feasibility of specific recovery of acetylated mRNAs through antibody-based RNA IP and subsequent mapping through cDNA-based methodologies. To assess for the occurrence of NAT10-regulated ac4C targets within mRNA, we coupled acRIP and next-generation sequencing (acRIP-seq) (Figure 3A; Table S1). IP was performed in duplicate in fragmented poly(A) RNA from parental HeLa cells and two NAT10−/− clones, followed by library construction and sequencing. acRIP-seq reads were mapped to a human reference genome to identify regions of enrichment relative to input and immunoglobulin G (IgG) control IP, and to a reference transcriptome to facilitate discrete peak calling across exon junctions (Figure 3A; Table S3). Acetylated β-globin spike-in recovery validated IP efficiency across samples (Figure S3B). Importantly, residual 18S rRNA was effectively enriched through acRIP in parental, but not in NAT10−/− HeLa cells (Figure 3D). Furthermore, regions of enrichment directly mapped to known 18S acetylation sites in helices 34 and 45 with peak heights roughly reflective of the respective stoichiometries (Taoka et al., 2018Taoka M. Nobe Y. Yamaki Y. Sato K. Ishikawa H. Izumikawa K. Yamauchi Y. Hirota K. Nakayama H. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Landscape of the complete RNA chemical modifications in the human 80S ribosome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 9289-9298Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast, specific enrichment of non-acetylated 28S rRNA was not observed when compared to IgG (Figure S3C). Bolstered by these results, we defined acetylated peaks in mRNA based on quantitative enrichment in parental relative to NAT10−/− acRIP, with no evidence of an overlapping peak in the IgG IP. After filtering for replication, a total of 4,250 candidate ac4C peaks were identified (Figure 3E). Examination of peak distributions across transcripts revealed that the majority of acetylated genes possess 1–2 ac4C peaks (Figure S3D). Representative browser shots depicting genome and transcriptome alignments of highly and moderately enriched targets, as well as a non-enriched control (FUS, POLR2A, and EEF1A1, respectively) show discrete peaks in the ac4C(+) mRNAs in parental HeLa cells that were substantially ablated in the absence of NAT10 (Figure 3F; Table S3). The attenuated signal in the NAT10−/− clones is consistent with the minor residual ac4C and NAT10 observed during clone validation (Figure 1). RT-qPCR validation of select targets supports acRIP-seq mapping accuracy, wherein enhanced amplification was determined at ac4C-rich versus -poor regions, that was reduced in NAT10−/− cells (Figure S3E). Additionally, NAT10-RIP followed by RT-qPCR mirrored the ac4C substrate enrichment: defined ac4C(+) targets showed increased interaction with NAT10 as compared to ac4C(–) targets, and association was decreased in response to NAT10 ablation (Figure S3F). Having established clear ac4C peaks, we next examined for biased localization within target transcripts. Input normalized ac4C read densities were plotted as a function of relative 5′ to 3′ positioning within substrate mRNAs (Figure 3G). The summarized distribution revealed ac4C peaks are not restricted to any particular location across target transcripts but display a general 5′ positional bias (Figure 3G). Moreover, ac4C peak summits were queried for relative location within specific transcript features (Table S4). Here, we observed ac4C sites cluster proximal to translation start sites with the majority of summits occurring within coding sequences (CDS) (Figure 3H). In terms of absolute numbers, ac4C was enriched in 5′ UTRs and CDS, and reciprocally depleted in 3′ UTRs as compared to the overall percentage of mRNA sequence assigned to these features (Figure 3H). The observed positional bias of ac4C implies a regulatory function in gene expression. In support of this premise, ac4C(+) transcripts were enriched for GO terms related to cell survival and viability, suggestive that reduced proliferation in NAT10−/− cells directly relates to altered expression of acetylated substrates (Figure S4A). We thus investigated the relationship between acetylation status and mRNA abundance. Differential gene expression upon ac4C loss was assessed through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) performed in NAT10−/−A and parental HeLa cells (Table S2). Examination of the pool of mRNAs with determined ac4C peaks revealed an overall tendency toward decreased expression upon NAT10 loss as compared to transcripts lacking ac4C (Figure 4A). While mRNAs not marked by ac4C showed a balanced response to NAT10 deletion, with comparable numbers of up- and downregulated genes, acetylated transcripts showed a considerable bias toward decreased expression upon ac4C loss (Figure 4B).Figure 4Loss of ac4C is Globally Associated with Target mRNA DownregulationShow full caption(A) Cumulative distribution function (CDF) plot depicting differential expression of ac4C(–) or ac4C(+) transcripts in NAT10−/−A versus parental HeLa cells (ac4C(–), n = 13,202; ac4C(+), n = 2,114). p = Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test.(B) Volcano plots of differentially expressed protein coding genes in NAT10−/−A versus parental HeLa cells, segregated by acetylation status.

CRISPR-based functional studies in T cells could prioritize novel targets for drug development and improve the design of genetically reprogrammed cell-based therapies. However, large-scale CRISPR screens have been challenging in primary human cells. We developed a new method, single guide RNA (sgRNA) lentiviral infection with Cas9 protein electroporation (SLICE), to identify regulators of stimulation responses in primary human T cells. Genome-wide loss-of-function screens identified essential T cell receptor signaling components and genes that negatively tune proliferation following stimulation. Targeted ablation of individual candidate genes characterized hits and identified perturbations that enhanced cancer cell killing. SLICE coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed signature stimulation-response gene programs altered by key genetic perturbations. SLICE genome-wide screening was also adaptable to identify mediators of immunosuppression, revealing genes controlling responses to adenosine signaling. The SLICE platform enables unbiased discovery and characterization of functional gene targets in primary cells."
https://openalex.org/W2901758876,"Approximately half of human genes generate mRNAs with alternative 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs). Through 3'UTR-mediated protein-protein interactions, alternative 3'UTRs enable multi-functionality of proteins with identical amino acid sequence. While studying how information on protein features is transferred from 3'UTRs to proteins, we discovered that the broadly expressed RNA-binding protein TIS11B forms a membraneless organelle, called TIS granule, that enriches membrane protein-encoding mRNAs with multiple AU-rich elements. TIS granules form a reticular meshwork intertwined with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The association between TIS granules and the ER creates a subcellular compartment-the TIGER domain-with a biophysically and biochemically distinct environment from the cytoplasm. This compartment promotes 3'UTR-mediated interaction of SET with membrane proteins, thus allowing increased surface expression and functional diversity of proteins, including CD47 and PD-L1. The TIGER domain is a subcellular compartment that enables formation of specific and functionally relevant protein-protein interactions that cannot be established outside."
https://openalex.org/W2901401327,"Objective To evaluate trends in racial, ethnic, and sex representation at US medical schools across 16 specialties: internal medicine, pediatrics, surgery, psychiatry, radiology, anesthesiology, obstetrics and gynecology, neurology, family practice, pathology, emergency medicine, orthopedic surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and dermatology. Using a novel, Census-derived statistical measure of diversity, the S-score, we quantified the degree of underrepresentation for racial minority groups and female faculty by rank for assistant, associate, and full professors from 1990–2016. Methods This longitudinal study of faculty diversity uses data obtained from the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) Faculty Roster from US allopathic medical schools. The proportion of professors of racial minority groups and female faculty by rank was compared to the US population based on data from the US Census Bureau. The Roster includes data on 52,939 clinical medical faculty in 1990, and 129,545 in 2016, at the assistant professor level or higher. The primary measure used in this study was the S-score, a measure of representation based on the probability of the observed frequency of faculty from a racial/ethnic group and sex, given the racial and ethnic distribution of the US. Pearson correlations and 95% confidence intervals for S-score with time were used to measure trends. Results Blacks and Hispanics showed statistically significant trends (p&lt;0.05) towards increasing underrepresentation in most specialties and are more underrepresented in 2016 than in 1990 across all ranks and specialties analyzed, except for Black females in obstetrics &amp; gynecology. White females were also underrepresented in many specialties and in a subset of specialties trended toward greater underrepresentation. Conclusions Current efforts to improve faculty diversity are inadequate in generating an academic physician workforce that represents the diversity of the US. More aggressive measures for faculty recruitment, retention, and promotion are necessary to reach equity in academia and healthcare."
https://openalex.org/W2900996634,"The molecular mediator and functional significance of meal-associated brown fat (BAT) thermogenesis remains elusive. Here, we identified the gut hormone secretin as a non-sympathetic BAT activator mediating prandial thermogenesis, which consequentially induces satiation, thereby establishing a gut-secretin-BAT-brain axis in mammals with a physiological role of prandial thermogenesis in the control of satiation. Mechanistically, meal-associated rise in circulating secretin activates BAT thermogenesis by stimulating lipolysis upon binding to secretin receptors in brown adipocytes, which is sensed in the brain and promotes satiation. Chronic infusion of a modified human secretin transiently elevates energy expenditure in diet-induced obese mice. Clinical trials with human subjects showed that thermogenesis after a single-meal ingestion correlated with postprandial secretin levels and that secretin infusions increased glucose uptake in BAT. Collectively, our findings highlight the largely unappreciated function of BAT in the control of satiation and qualify BAT as an even more attractive target for treating obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2901511860,"Preeclampsia is a placentally induced hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality to mothers and fetuses. Clinical manifestations of preterm preeclampsia result from excess circulating soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor FLT1 (sFLT1 or sVEGFR1) of placental origin. Here we identify short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that selectively silence the three sFLT1 mRNA isoforms primarily responsible for placental overexpression of sFLT1 without reducing levels of full-length FLT1 mRNA. Full chemical stabilization in the context of hydrophobic modifications enabled productive siRNA accumulation in the placenta (up to 7% of injected dose) and reduced circulating sFLT1 in pregnant mice (up to 50%). In a baboon preeclampsia model, a single dose of siRNAs suppressed sFLT1 overexpression and clinical signs of preeclampsia. Our results demonstrate RNAi-based extrahepatic modulation of gene expression with nonformulated siRNAs in nonhuman primates and establish a path toward a new treatment paradigm for patients with preterm preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W2901717894,"Previous studies suggest that the brain operates at a critical point in which phases of order and disorder coexist, producing emergent patterned dynamics at all scales and optimizing several brain functions. Here, we combined light-sheet microscopy with GCaMP zebrafish larvae to study whole-brain dynamics in vivo at near single-cell resolution. We show that spontaneous activity propagates in the brain's three-dimensional space, generating scale-invariant neuronal avalanches with time courses and recurrence times that exhibit statistical self-similarity at different magnitude, temporal, and frequency scales. This suggests that the nervous system operates close to a non-equilibrium phase transition, where a large repertoire of spatial, temporal, and interactive modes can be supported. Finally, we show that gap junctions contribute to the maintenance of criticality and that, during interactions with the environment (sensory inputs and self-generated behaviors), the system is transiently displaced to a more ordered regime, conceivably to limit the potential sensory representations and motor outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2900794929,"Limited T cell availability and proliferative exhaustion present major barriers to successful T cell-based immunotherapies and may potentially be overcome through the use of ""rejuvenated"" induced pluripotent stem cells derived from antigen-specific T cells (T-iPSCs). However, strict antigen specificity is essential for safe and efficient T cell immunotherapy. Here, we report that CD8αβ T cells from human T-iPSCs lose their antigen specificity through additional rearrangement of the T cell receptor (TCR) α chain gene during the CD4/CD8 double positive stage of in vitro differentiation. CRISPR knockout of a recombinase gene in the T-iPSCs prevented this additional TCR rearrangement. Moreover, when CD8αβ T cells were differentiated from monocyte-derived iPSCs that were transduced with an antigen-specific TCR, they showed monoclonal expression of the transduced TCR. TCR-stabilized, regenerated CD8αβ T cells effectively inhibit tumor growth in xenograft cancer models. These approaches could contribute to safe and effective regenerative T cell immunotherapies."

However, complexes of TIM chaperones with the aggregation-prone membrane proteins in transit have remained elusive, due to the challenge of preparing and characterizing such complexes in vitro and the difficulty of obtaining structural insights into chaperone/client protein complexes. The structure, dynamics, and interactions of this complex remain unresolved. To gain structural insight into the chaperone mechanism, we developed in vitro protocols to reconstitute recombinantly expressed carriers with the TIM9·10 chaperone. Samples for structural studies were prepared by attaching unfolded carriers to a metal-affinity resin, addition of TIM9·10 and elution of the chaperone/precursor protein complex (Figure 1A). In an orthogonal approach, we produced the GDP/GTP carrier Ggc1/TIM9·10 complex by in vitro translation (Figure S1A). These findings establish that recombinant TIM9·10 is able to bind the precursor proteins in an unfolded form as well as polypeptide exiting the ribosome. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of TIM9·10 carrying either Ggc1 or Aac3 (ADP/ATP carrier, or adenine nucleotide translocator) feature cross-peak positions that are similar to those of apo TIM9·10 (Figures 1B and S1B–S1D). The similarity of apo and holo complex spectra establishes that the hexameric chaperone remains structurally intact upon membrane protein binding, excluding models in which either monomeric Tim chains bind to precursor proteins or in which α helices of the carrier precursor protein intercalate in between the subunits of the oligomeric chaperone (Webb et al., 2006Webb C.T. Gorman M.A. Lazarou M. Ryan M.T. Gulbis J.M. Crystal structure of the mitochondrial chaperone TIM9.10 reveals a six-bladed α-propeller.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only a single set of cross-peaks is observed, indicating that each of the symmetry-related Tim subunits in the hexameric complex adopts the same conformation and precursor interaction on the fast-exchange NMR timescale (i.e., up to the ms [ms] timescale). Local asymmetry is averaged out on the sub-ms timescale. The resonance peak intensities in samples of TIM9·10 bound to carrier proteins are reduced compared to apo TIM9·10, in particular for backbone NH sites (Figures S1E–S1G). As outlined below, the strongly reduced NMR peak intensity can be ascribed to the larger size and conformational dynamics of the TIM/precursor protein complexes.Figure S1Formation and Characterization of TIM9·10 Binding Mitochondrial Carriers, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Production of TIM9·10/Ggc1 using a cell-free protein production reaction mixture containing the expression plasmid encoding the Ggc1 sequence, complemented by either detergent (Brij35) or different concentrations of TIM9·10.

ΔR1 is obtained as the difference of R1 measured with bound MTSL-labeled Ggc1, and the corresponding relaxation rate constant in the same sample after reduction of the spin label by addition of ascorbic acid. The resonance of Val16 is broadened beyond detection (indicated in purple). In the dataset shown in (I), residue L36 is not graphically shown due to its large error margin; its value is 0.097 ± 0.5. All error margins shown in this figure were determined from 3 times the spectral noise level. (J and K) The observed PRE effects are plotted onto the structure of TIM9·10 in (MTSL at C222 in J) and (MTSL label at C8 in K). For further structural investigations, we exploited the intrinsically higher detection sensitivity of methyl groups and used deuterated samples with 13CH3-labeling at Ala, Leu, and Val (ALV) side chains. We identified the binding sites of the precursor protein on the TIM hexamer through NMR saturation-transfer methods, which probe the spatial proximity of hydrogen atoms on Ggc1 to ALV methyl groups on TIM9·10 (Figures 1C and 1D). Residues with the strongest transferred-nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) are located in the cleft formed between the N- and C-terminal helices. To obtain independent insight into the precursor protein binding, we used paramagnetic NMR experiments in which we attached a paramagnetic spin label to Ggc1, either in a transmembrane helix (residue 222) or at the N terminus (residue 8), and monitored how the Ggc1-bound spin label enhances the spin relaxation of ALV sites on TIM9·10. In agreement with the saturation-transfer data, the largest PRE-effects are observed for residues located in the hydrophobic cleft (Figures S1H–S1K). We then investigated whether precursors of outer-membrane β-barrel proteins use the same interaction cleft of TIM9·10. The methods, which were successfully used for generating complexes with inner-membrane precursor proteins, failed to yield stable complexes with full-length β-barrel precursors, suggesting that these complexes are less stable. However, we succeeded in analyzing the binding of a peptide fragment of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) comprising the two C-terminal β strands, VDAC257–279, to TIM9·10. Both cross-linking (Figure 2A) and NMR titration experiments (Figures 2B and 2C) demonstrated that only the cyclic VDAC257–279 peptide that adopts a β-hairpin conformation (Jores et al., 2016Jores T. Klinger A. Groß L.E. Kawano S. Flinner N. Duchardt-Ferner E. Wöhnert J. Kalbacher H. Endo T. Schleiff E. Rapaport D. Characterization of the targeting signal in mitochondrial β-barrel proteins.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 12036Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) interacts with the chaperone while the linear variant does not (Figures 2 and S2). This observation highlights the importance of the β-hairpin conformation for interaction. The binding site, revealed by backbone and methyl chemical-shift perturbations, comprises the same clamp-like binding cleft that interacts with inner-membrane protein precursors (Figure 2D).Figure S2Binding of VDAC257-279 Peptides to Wild-Type and Mutant TIM9·10, Related to Figure 2Show full captionThe protein constructs, (WT, or mutations V29K or F33Q of the Tim10 subunits) are indicated, as well as the identity of the peptide (linear, cyclic).

Titration points with different concentrations of VDAC257-279 peptides (at a constant TIM9·10 concentration of 200 μM) are shown with different colors. To investigate the relevance of the identified binding cleft for TIM function, we performed a sequence alignment of mitochondrial TIM chaperone proteins from yeast to human. We found that residues in this binding cleft form a conserved core motif with hydrophobic residues located at positions −14, −11, −8, and −7 before and at +5, +11, and +15 after the twin CX3C motif (Figures 3A and S3A). The conserved hydrophobic positions point into the cleft between the N-terminal inner helix and the C-terminal outer helix (Figure 3B), which were identified by our structural NMR data as precursor binding sites. To evaluate the importance of the conserved motif in vivo, we performed site directed mutagenesis of the essential yeast TIM9 and TIM10 genes (Truscott et al., 2002Truscott K.N. Wiedemann N. Rehling P. Müller H. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Guiard B. Mitochondrial import of the ADP/ATP carrier: the essential TIM complex of the intermembrane space is required for precursor release from the TOM complex.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7780-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For all conserved positions in yeast Tim9 and Tim10, except for the positions −4 and +4 that form the cleft constriction (Figure S3B), the hydrophobic residues were replaced by hydrophilic amino acids. Growth of the resulting yeast tim9 and tim10 mutant strains was analyzed on fermentable glucose (YPD) and non-fermentable glycerol (YPG) medium (Figures 3C and S3C). The TIM9 mutations M21S, V70K, and F74K are lethal and the mutations F24K, L27K, and Y28Q caused significant growth defects. The TIM10 mutations L26K, V29K, M32K, F33Q, V76K, and M80K caused similar defects on both carbon sources, in agreement with the essential role of the TIM chaperones. To analyze the in vivo defects of these single point mutations, mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation from cells grown at non-permissive condition at 37°C (Figures 3C and S3C). The steady-state levels, as monitored by western blotting, of inner membrane metabolite carriers like Aac2, Dic1 (dicarboxylate carrier), and Yhm2 (citrate and oxoglutarate carrier), as well as those of the carrier-like proteins Tim22 and Tim23, were reduced in the single point mutants affecting the hydrophobic motif of either Tim9 or Tim10 (Figure 3D). This mutational analysis substantiates the relevance of the conserved TIM chaperone motif for the biogenesis of metabolite carrier proteins.Figure S3Characterization of Yeast Cells Expressing tim9 and tim10 Variants of the Conserved Motif, Related to Figures 3A, 3C–3F, 4A–4E, and 5A–5DShow full caption(A) Conserved motif (red) of soluble intermembrane space TIM chaperones in the inner N-terminal and outer C-terminal helices.

More than 150 years ago, the French physiologist Claude Bernard proposed the concept of milieu intérieur—that survival of an organism depends on keeping a constant internal environment despite changes in the external environment. The concept was later elaborated by Walter Cannon, who introduced the concept of homeostasis—keeping physiological responses within a narrow limit through feedback regulation (Cooper, 2008Cooper S.J. From Claude Bernard to Walter Cannon. Emergence of the concept of homeostasis.Appetite. 2008; 51: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although food is necessary for survival, food intake poses a threat on multiple processes in whole-body homeostasis (Woods, 1991Woods S.C. The eating paradox: how we tolerate food.Psychol. Rev. 1991; 98: 488-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), such as leading to elevated glucose levels and activated protein and lipid synthesis. Although the majority of homeostatic mechanisms operate based on internal feedback regulatory mechanisms, the organism has evolved systems to anticipate the impact of food consumption on homeostasis (Moore-Ede, 1986Moore-Ede M.C. Physiology of the circadian timing system: predictive versus reactive homeostasis.Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: R737-R752PubMed Google Scholar, Smith, 2000Smith G.P. The controls of eating: a shift from nutritional homeostasis to behavioral neuroscience.Nutrition. 2000; 16: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Seeing, smelling, and tasting food, often termed as the cephalic phase, elicits a myriad of physiological changes, including increased heart rate (LeBlanc and Cabanac, 1989LeBlanc J. Cabanac M. Cephalic postprandial thermogenesis in human subjects.Physiol. Behav. 1989; 46: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), saliva production, and secretion of digestive enzymes (Feldman and Richardson, 1986Feldman M. Richardson C.T. Role of thought, sight, smell, and taste of food in the cephalic phase of gastric acid secretion in humans.Gastroenterology. 1986; 90: 428-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This ensures that nutrients are rapidly metabolized and more efficiently removed from the circulation (Power and Schulkin, 2008Power M.L. Schulkin J. Anticipatory physiological regulation in feeding biology: cephalic phase responses.Appetite. 2008; 50: 194-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The cephalic phase is considered to be fast and transient in nature and mediated by both the parasympathetic (PNS) and sympathetic (SNS) branches of the autonomic nervous system (Diamond and LeBlanc, 1987Diamond P. LeBlanc J. Role of autonomic nervous system in postprandial thermogenesis in dogs.Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: E719-E726PubMed Google Scholar). Functionally, intragastric feeding, which bypasses the sensory phase of food consumption or pre-meal treatment of humans with a ganglionic blocker, leads to exaggerated glucose excursions (Ahrén and Holst, 2001Ahrén B. Holst J.J. The cephalic insulin response to meal ingestion in humans is dependent on both cholinergic and noncholinergic mechanisms and is important for postprandial glycemia.Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, LeBlanc et al., 1984LeBlanc J. Cabanac M. Samson P. Reduced postprandial heat production with gavage as compared with meal feeding in human subjects.Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: E95-E101PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanisms through which food perception primes body physiology limit the potential harm arising from incoming nutrients. Nevertheless, the neuronal pathways involved and the molecular mechanisms affected in peripheral organs to mediate this adaptive response are only partly defined. Notably the liver is a metabolically highly flexible organ that undergoes rapid changes in the transition from the fasted to the fed state (Seitz et al., 1977Seitz H.J. Müller M.J. Krone W. Tarnowski W. Coordinate control of intermediary metabolism in rat liver by the insulin/glucagon ratio during starvation and after glucose refeeding. Regulatory significance of long-chain acyl-CoA and cyclic AMP.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 183: 647-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the postprandial phase, elevated circulating levels of insulin and nutrients activate hepatic signaling through the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (Inoki et al., 2002Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. TSC2 is phosphorylated and inhibited by Akt and suppresses mTOR signalling.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). mTOR is a key subunit of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 with distinct and overlapping functions (Saxton and Sabatini, 2017Saxton R.A. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling in growth, metabolism, and disease.Cell. 2017; 169: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). Similar to the mTOR pathway, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response is activated in nutrient-repleted liver in response to accumulation of unfolded proteins (Deng et al., 2013Deng Y. Wang Z.V. Tao C. Gao N. Holland W.L. Ferdous A. Repa J.J. Liang G. Ye J. Lehrman M.A. et al.The Xbp1s/GalE axis links ER stress to postprandial hepatic metabolism.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This ER-stress response requires the activity of a serine/threonine-protein kinase/endoribonuclease, the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) (Cox et al., 1993Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Walter P. Transcriptional induction of genes encoding endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins requires a transmembrane protein kinase.Cell. 1993; 73: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, Mori et al., 1993Mori K.

A transmembrane protein with a cdc2+/CDC28-related kinase activity is required for signaling from the ER to the nucleus.Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), to increase protein-folding capacity and to adapt ER homeostasis. Once unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, the chaperone BIP is released from IRE, resulting in activation of its endonuclease activity to execute unconventional splicing of the X-Box binding protein (Xbp1) mRNA and translation of the mature Xbp1 transcription factor (Cox and Walter, 1996Cox J.S. Walter P.

A new member of the leucine zipper class of proteins that binds to the HLA DR alpha promoter.Science. 1990; 247: 1581-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This in turn activates a complex transcriptional response to readapt protein folding through expression not only of chaperone genes (Lee et al., 2003Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Accumulating data indicate an overlapping regulation of mTOR and Xbp1 in the postprandial liver (Pfaffenbach et al., 2010Pfaffenbach K.T. Nivala A.M. Reese L. Ellis F. Wang D. Wei Y. Pagliassotti M.J. Rapamycin inhibits postprandial-mediated X-box-binding protein-1 splicing in rat liver.J. Nutr. 2010; 140: 879-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to direct nutrient and insulin signaling in hepatocytes, also the central nervous system plays an important role in coordinating the physiological responses in metabolic tissues including the liver (Ruud et al., 2017Ruud J. Steculorum S.M. Brüning J.C. Neuronal control of peripheral insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15259Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In particular, specialized energy-state-sensing neurons in the hypothalamus can adapt autonomic outflow to organs such as liver, adipose tissue, and pancreas in accordance to energy availability of the organism. An important neurocircuit in these processes comprises the functionally antagonistic orexigenic agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing and the anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus (Cone, 2006Cone R.D. Studies on the physiological functions of the melanocortin system.Endocr. Rev. 2006; 27: 736-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, Gautron et al., 2015Gautron L. Elmquist J.K. Williams K.W. Neural control of energy balance: translating circuits to therapies.Cell. 2015; 161: 133-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), which, in addition to regulating food intake, also coordinate multiple metabolic processes in peripheral organs (Könner et al., 2007Könner A.C. Janoschek R. Plum L. Jordan S.D. Rother E. Ma X. Xu C. Enriori P. Hampel B.

Steculorum S.M. Brüning J.C. Neuronal control of peripheral insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15259Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Both AgRP and POMC neurons express receptors for energy state-communicating hormones, leading to the predominant view that their activity is subject to feedback regulation via hormones that increase subsequent to nutrient intake (Belgardt and Brüning, 2010Belgardt B.F.

However, it has recently been demonstrated that these neurons rapidly and transiently change their activity already upon food perception before nutrients are consumed (Betley et al., 2015Betley J.N. Xu S. Cao Z.F.H. Gong R. Magnus C.J. Yu Y. Sternson S.M.

We sought to test whether the sight and smell of food are sufficient to prime the liver for the incoming nutrients. Through a combination of phosphoproteomic, transcriptomic, and lipidomic screens, we found that food cues transiently activate hepatic mTOR and ER-stress signaling to prime ER adaptation for incoming nutrients. Food perception rapidly activated POMC neurons, and chemogenetic activation of these neurons resulted in a rapid increase of sympathetic output to the liver. Acute optogenetic stimulation of POMC neurons in the ARC was sufficient to activate mTOR signaling and Xbp1 splicing in the liver. In hepatocytes, norepinephrine stimulation lead to mTOR activation and induced Xbp1 splicing. Thus, we uncovered a principal pathway through which food perception primes liver adaptation by engaging melanocortin-dependent control of liver SNA to promote mTOR- and Xbp1-dependent coordination of ER homeostasis. Given the rapid effects of food perception on the activity of the melanocortin circuitry, which also regulates peripheral metabolism, we investigated whether food perception might evoke changes in the liver transcriptome. Wild-type mice were fasted for 16 hr and then either allowed to eat a standard rodent chow (refed) or presented with inaccessible standard rodent chow that could be seen and smelled but not consumed (caged food) (Figures 1A and S1A). Mice were sacrificed after fasting or after different periods of refeeding or caged food exposure. Refeeding rapidly elevated blood glucose and insulin levels and resulted in a delayed increase in leptin levels after 2 hr (Figure S1B). Caged food exposure resulted after 30 min in a slight increase in blood glucose levels, which returned to baseline after 1 hr (Figure S1B), whereas circulating insulin concentrations remained unchanged (Figure S1C). Neither refeeding nor caged food presentation increased circulating norepinephrine concentrations (Figure S1C).Figure S1Food Perception Alters Hepatic Gene Expression, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Picture showing the fake food next to a normal standard chow pellet and how a wire mesh is wrapped around the pellet to generate the caged food used throughout the experiment and its placement in the food hopper.(B) Food intake per cage, blood glucose, serum insulin, and leptin concentrations in 16 hr fasted mice or those exposed to caged food or refed for 30, 60, 120, or 240 min (n = 3–10 animals/condition).(C) Insulin and norepinephrine concentrations in plasma from 16 hr fasted mice or mice exposed to caged food or after refeeding for 5, 10, and 30 min (n = 6 animals/condition).(D) Point plot showing the averaged Log2 ratio with 95% CI compared to fasted mice for transcripts assigned to “fatty acid beta oxidation” and ”glucokinase by GK regulated protein.” Line plots visualize the time profiles of individual genes (n = 3).(E) Quantification of spliced and total Xbp1 mRNA expression in liver from 16 hr fasted mice (n = 5), or following refeeding (n = 5), presentation of caged food (n = 5), fake food (n = 5), or caged fake food (n = 5) for 30 min measured by qPCR relative to Hprt expression.Statistics: For (B), (C), (E) ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 indicate significantly difference from fasted group, § significantly different from 30 min time point within group and $$$ different from all other time points within the given group by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnet’s multiple comparisons test.

(D) mean ± 95% confidence intervals. Data in (B), (C), and (E), box-whisker plots. A principal component (PC) analysis on the hepatic mRNA expression in the different groups of mice revealed a clear separation of liver samples from refed mice compared to fasted animals; this separation was evident as early as 30 min after food exposure, persisting at all later time points (Figure 1B; Table S1). Interestingly, caged food exposure also induced a different gene expression relative to the fasted mice within 30 to 60 min after sensory food perception (Figure 1B). The number of differentially expressed genes in livers of refed mice or those exposed to caged food (Log2-fold change > 1, FDR < 0.05) exhibited a differential kinetic. Exposure to caged food resulted in differential expression of 23 genes after 30 min, 23 genes after 1 hr, and 21 genes after 2 hr, whereas only 1 gene was differentially expressed 4 hr after sensory food perception. In contrast, refeeding resulted in a constant increase in the number of differentially expressed genes from 180 after 30 min to 639 after 4 hr (Figure 1C; Table S1). Next, we postulated that gene-expression changes induced by caged food exposure and refeeding could overlap. We performed a 1D gene annotation analysis aiming for the identification of annotation terms (GO, KEGG, and GSEA) that are systematically larger/smaller than the global distribution of Log2 ratios comparing each group to the group of fasted mice (Table S1). This analysis revealed that “activation of chaperone genes by Xbp1” and “protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum” annotations were significantly upregulated in response to both caged food and refeeding (Figure 1D; Table S1). Analysis of candidate gene expression in these GO terms by real-time PCR (qPCR) confirmed that expression of Dnajb9, Pdia6, Dnajc3, and Herpud1 was indeed increased in livers of refed mice or those exposed to caged food (Figure 1E). In contrast, classical insulin- and nutrient-regulated pathways such as “fatty acid beta oxidation” were downregulated by refeeding and not upon exposure to caged food, whereas genes of the GO term “glucokinase by GK regulatory protein” were upregulated in response to refeeding but remained unchanged upon sensory food perception (Figure S1D). Given that splicing of Xbp1 mRNA constitutes a key step in the initiation of the ER-stress-induced transcriptional program, we assessed changes in expression of spliced and unspliced Xbp1. Exposure to caged food increased the expression of spliced Xbp1(s) mRNA after 30 and 60 min, whereas both Xbp1(s) and unspliced Xbp1(u) expression continued to increase until 120 min after refeeding (Figure 1F). These results were further validated by visualization of Xbp1(s) in a complementary approach (Figure 1G). Importantly, 30 min exposure of accessible or inaccessible faked food (wooden pellet) did not increase Xbp1(s) expression (Figure S1E). Next, we performed an unbiased phosphoproteomic screen on liver tissue obtained from mice that were either fasted, refed, or exposed to caged food for 30 min employing an in vivo SILAC-based quantification strategy as outlined in Figure 2A and Table S2 for all identified phosphosites. In total we identified aproximately 19,000 phosphosites (Table S2), and the pattern of phosphorylation was highly reproducible across different liver samples within each experimental group (Figure S2). A PC analysis showed clear separation of liver samples from 30 min refed mice compared to livers of fasted mice, with livers from mice exposed to caged food in between (Figure 2B). Employing a restricted analysis of the whole dataset, GO terms related to insulin signaling were enriched only in livers from refed mice (Figure 2C). This was further confirmed when comparing phosphorylated sequence windows for proteins containing an Akt kinase motif (Figure 2D).Figure S2Food Perception Induces Changes in the Hepatic Phosphoproteom Related to Figure 2Show full captionProfile plot of all biological replicates of known phosphorylation sites that are regulated in response to insulin indicating high reproducibility across individual samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Profile plot of all biological replicates of known phosphorylation sites that are regulated in response to insulin indicating high reproducibility across individual samples. Next, we aimed to identify phosphosites commonly regulated in livers from refed mice and those exposed to caged food. This unrestricted analysis revealed that phosphoproteins annotated to pathways related to ribosomal S6, TOR, Rho, Ras, and AMPK were enriched in the group of phosphorylation sites that were similarly regulated in both groups compared to fasted mice (Figures 2E and 2F). Phosphorylation sites on the ribosomal protein S6 (S6) were found to have a Log2-fold change of 2 to 5 both in refed mice and in those exposed to caged food and ranked among the strongest regulated sites (Figure 2E; Table S2). S6 phosphosites were found to include the most commonly regulated sites within the C-terminal region, including Ser235/236/240/244/247 (Figure 2E; Table S2). Moreover, mTOR signaling regulates initiation of mRNA translation by controlling the phosphorylation of a range of eukaryotic initiation factors (Jiang et al., 2016Jiang X. Feng S. Chen Y. Feng Y. Deng H. Proteomic analysis of mTOR inhibition-mediated phosphorylation changes in ribosomal proteins and eukaryotic translation initiation factors.Protein Cell. 2016; 7: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and we found altered phosphorylation of eIF3a, eIF4b, eIF4G, and eIF5b, which all form a part of the initiation complex together with S6 (Table S2). We also compared our data to published liver phosphoproteomic data from liver samples of fasted and 1 hr refed rats treated with and without rapamycin (Demirkan et al., 2011Demirkan G. Yu K. Boylan J.M. Salomon A.R. Gruppuso P.A. Phosphoproteomic profiling of in vivo signaling in liver by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1).PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e21729Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Out of the 28 rapamycin-sensitive phosphosites activated by refeeding, we found 12 of these sites to be commonly upregulated in livers of refed mice and those exposed to caged food in our dataset (Table S2). To potentially link the observed changes in the phosphoproteome to the transcriptional changes described above, we further performed a 2D analysis combining our phosphoproteomic data with the RNA-sequencing data at the 30 min time point. This 2D enrichment analysis corroborated the finding of enrichment of pathways related to ribosomal S6 protein and ribosome biogenesis and with downregulation of beta-oxidation, glycogen, lipid, and ketone catabolism upon refeeding (Figure 2G; Table S2). In addition, we identified commonly regulated transcripts and phosphoproteins in the GO terms related to the synthesis of phosphatidylcholines (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) upon both refeeding and exposure to caged food (Figure 2G). By manual inspection of the phosphoproteomic data, we detected phosphorylation of proteins, which were also detected as differentially expressed transcripts in the 2D analysis. Thus, phosphorylation of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (Pcyt1a), the rate-limiting enzyme in PC synthesis, and phosphorylation of ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (Pcyt2), involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamines, were detected in both liver of refed mice and those exposed to caged food (Table S2). Because we had focused our initial phosphosproteomic screen on samples from animals that had been exposed to food or caged food for 30 min, we potentially detected changes in downstream components of rapidly activated phosphorylation cascades. For example, S6 phosphorylation is a distal signaling event in the mTORC1 pathway. However, our phosphoproteomic screen revealed increased phosphorylation of mTOR (Ser2481) and the mTOR complex protein Raptor (Ser859/863) only in livers of refed mice (Figure 2E; Table S2). Therefore, we investigated rapid phosphorylation events upstream of S6 by western blot analysis in samples of mice that had been exposed to refeeding or caged food for shorter periods of time. Strikingly, after only 5 min of refeeding or food perception, we detected increased Akt phosphorylation (Ser473) and mTOR phosphorylation (Ser2448) (Figure 3A). Caged food exposure and refeeding both also increased phosphorylation of 70 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (P70S6K) (Thr389) at this time point. (Figure 3A). In contrast, only S6 (Ser235/236) phosphorylation was increased under refed conditions with no effect on S6 (Ser240/244) phosphorylation (Figure 3A). In contrast, after 10 min, phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) in liver from mice exposed to caged food had already returned to baseline, whereas refeeding induced a maintained elevated Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation (Figure 3B). In liver from animals exposed to caged food or refed for 10 min, mTOR (Ser2448), P70S6K (Thr389), S6 (Ser235/236), and (Ser240/244) phosphorylation were all elevated compared to fasted mice. In contrast to these early changes in mTOR signaling, livers from mice exposed to caged food or refed for 10 min did not exhibit elevated levels of Xbp1(s) (Figure S3A).Figure S3Food Perception Activates Hepatic mTOR Signaling, Rela"
https://openalex.org/W2901423492,"The promiscuous nature of T-cell receptors (TCRs) allows T cells to recognize a large variety of pathogens, but makes it challenging to understand and control T-cell recognition. Existing technologies provide limited information about the key requirements for T-cell recognition and the ability of TCRs to cross-recognize structurally related elements. Here we present a 'one-pot' strategy for determining the interactions that govern TCR recognition of peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC). We measured the relative affinities of TCRs to libraries of barcoded peptide-MHC variants and applied this knowledge to understand the recognition motif, here termed the TCR fingerprint. The TCR fingerprints of 16 different TCRs were identified and used to predict and validate cross-recognized peptides from the human proteome. The identified fingerprints differed among TCRs recognizing the same epitope, demonstrating the value of this strategy for understanding T-cell interactions and assessing potential cross-recognition before selection of TCRs for clinical development."
https://openalex.org/W2901256394,"Quantum information processing made a tremendous and remarkable impact on number of classical mechanic’s problems. The impact does not only stop at classical mechanics but also the cyber security paradigm. Quantum information and cryptography are two classes of quantum information processing which use the idea of qubits instead of bits as in classical information security. The idea of fast computations with multiple complexity level is becoming more realistic in the age of quantum information due to quantum parallelism where a single quantum computer does allow to compute hundreds of classical computers with less efforts and more accuracy. The evolution of quantum information processing replaces a number of classical mechanic’s aspects in computational and cyber security sciences. Our aim here is to introduce concepts of applied quantum dynamics in cryptography, which leads to an evolution of quantum cryptography. Quantum cryptography is one of the most astonishing solicitations of quantum information theory. To measure the quantum state of any system is not possible without disturbing that system. The facts of quantum mechanics on traditional cryptosystems lead to a new protocol and achieving maximum remarkable security for systems. The scope of this paper is to design an innovative encryption scheme for digital data based on quantum spinning and rotation operators."
https://openalex.org/W2900900797,"A genome-wide assay defines the relationship of cis-regulatory sequences and chromatin structure in regulating gene expression. A gene's position in the genome can profoundly affect its expression because regional differences in chromatin modulate the activity of locally acting cis-regulatory sequences (CRSs). Here we study how CRSs and regional chromatin act in concert on a genome-wide scale. We present a massively parallel reporter gene assay that measures the activities of hundreds of different CRSs, each integrated at many specific genomic locations. Although genome location strongly affected CRS activity, the relative strengths of CRSs were maintained at all chromosomal locations. The intrinsic activities of CRSs also correlated with their activities in plasmid-based assays. We explain our data with a quantitative model in which expression levels are set by independent contributions from local CRSs and the regional chromatin environment, rather than by more complex sequence- or protein-specific interactions between these two factors. The methods we present will help investigators determine when regulatory information is integrated in a modular fashion and when regulatory sequences interact in more complex ways."
https://openalex.org/W2901947519,"The impact of climate change on agricultural systems is a major concern as it can have a significant effect on the world food supply. The objective of this study was to evaluate climate change impacts on crop production and nitrate leaching in two distinct climatic zones in Canada. Spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was selected for the semiarid regions of Western Canada (Swift Current, SK) and maize (Zea mays L.) was chosen for the more humid regions of central Canada (Woodslee, ON). Climate scenarios were based upon simulations from a Canadian Regional Climate Model (CanRCM4) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and crop simulations were conducted using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) model. Compared to the baseline climate scenario, wheat yields increased by 8, 8, 11, 15%, whereas maize yields decreased by 15, 25, 22, 41% under RCP4.5 2050s (2041-2070), RCP4.5 2080s (2071-2100), RCP8.5 2050s and RCP8.5 2080s scenarios, respectively. Annual nitrate leaching increased by 19, 57, 73, 129% at Swift Current and by 84, 117, 208, 317% at Woodslee under the four scenarios, respectively. Adaptation measures suggested that fertilizer N rate for spring wheat should be increased to 80-100 kg N ha-1 to obtain optimal yields although this will result in an additional risk of 5-8 kg N ha-1 nitrate leaching at Swift Current. The fertilizer N rate of 150 kg N ha-1 was found to be suitable for high maize yields at Woodslee. New wheat and maize cultivars with long growing seasons would enable crop growth to match the phenological stage and hence maintain high crop yields to adapt to increased temperatures in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2900751312,"Digital imaging has become one of the most important techniques in environmental monitoring and exploration. In the case of the marine environment, mobile platforms such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are now equipped with high-resolution cameras to capture huge collections of images from the seabed. However, the timely evaluation of all these images presents a bottleneck problem as tens of thousands or more images can be collected during a single dive. This makes computational support for marine image analysis essential. Computer-aided analysis of environmental images (and marine images in particular) with machine learning algorithms is promising, but challenging and different to other imaging domains because training data and class labels cannot be collected as efficiently and comprehensively as in other areas. In this paper, we present Machine learning Assisted Image Annotation (MAIA), a new image annotation method for environmental monitoring and exploration that overcomes the obstacle of missing training data. The method uses a combination of autoencoder networks and Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN), which allows human observers to annotate large image collections much faster than before. We evaluated the method with three marine image datasets featuring different types of background, imaging equipment and object classes. Using MAIA, we were able to annotate objects of interest with an average recall of 84.1% more than twice as fast as compared to “traditional” annotation methods, which are purely based on software-supported direct visual inspection and manual annotation. The speed gain increases proportionally with the size of a dataset. The MAIA approach represents a substantial improvement on the path to greater efficiency in the annotation of large benthic image collections."
https://openalex.org/W2901766005,"Background Infertility is estimated to affect approximately 9–30% of reproductive-aged couples. Several conditions involving one or both partners may contribute to infertility. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of asymptomatic genital tract infections in the outcome of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) in couples with infertility. Methods A total of 285 infertile couples were enrolled in the study. Vaginal/endocervical swabs and semen samples were collected and subjected to microbiological analysis. Spermiograms were carried out on semen specimens, and lactobacilli were quantified in vaginal swabs. Data were associated with IVF results and analysed by using non parametric tests and multivariate analysis. Results Microbiological analysis showed that 46.3% of couples presented with an asymptomatic genital tract infection. Spermiogram results showed a significantly diminished motility of sperm cells in samples positive to microbiological testing compared to negative specimens. Enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species (11.6%) in positive semen samples and was found to negatively affect both sperm morphology (p = 0.026) and motility (p = 0.003). Analysis of genital swabs from females showed that the presence of E. faecalis (p<0.0001), Escherichia coli (p = 0.0123), Streptococcus agalactiae (p<0.0001), and Gardnerella vaginalis (p = 0.0003) was significantly associated to reduced levels of vaginal lactobacilli. Association of microbiological data with IVF outcome showed that 85.7% of IVF+ couples was microbiologically negative, while IVF was successful in just 7.5% of couples infected with E. faecalis and/or U. urealyticum and/or M. hominis (p = 0.02). Conclusions The results show the negative impact of E. faecalis on sperm quality and the association of definite bacterial pathogens with reduced levels of vaginal lactobacilli. The presence of E. faecalis and/or U. urealyticum and/or M. hominis in genital samples of infertile couples is predictive for a negative outcome of IVF."
https://openalex.org/W2900492358,"Muscle dysmorphia (MD) is a condition that is characterized by body image disturbance, a drive for muscularity and excessive exercising. It leads to considerable functional impairment. Most previous studies focused on male samples. The study aimed to validate a German version of the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory (MDDI) in order to make the instrument available in German speaking countries. We further aimed to explore for gender differences in the MDDI factors (measurement invariance) and to assess the relationship between MD and positive dimensions of body experience as well as exercise dependence. 394 participants (53% females, mean age 24.3 years) took part in an internet-based survey. The three-factor structure of the English version of the MDDI was replicated, independent of gender (multi group CFA; Base model TLI = .961; CFI = .970). Cronbach´s alpha was .81-.84 for the subscales and .75 for the MDDI total score. MD was associated with exercise dependence and negatively correlated with dimensions of positive body experience, which can be considered relevant for satisfying relationships and a positive sense of self: e.g. body contact and sexual fulfillment. Men and women showed differences in two subscales of the MDDI (appearance intolerance, drive for size). Testing for measurement invariance resulted in weak invariance: Equivalent factor structure for men and women, but significantly different loadings and coefficients. No statistically significant difference in the MDDI total score was found. The findings suggest good psychometric properties of the German version of the MDDI. Future studies should address the question of cut-off scores and norms for different samples as well as a possible overlap between MD and eating disorder psychopathology in women."
https://openalex.org/W2900637113,"The first outbreak in Japan of GES-5 carbapenemase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurred in a long-term care facility in 2014. To assess the spread of GES-5 producing P. aeruginosa clinical isolates in medical settings in Japan, 1,476 carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates obtained from 2012 to 2016 were characterized. Of these 1,476 isolates, 104 (7.0%) harbored blaGES-5. Southern blotting revealed that the blaGES-5 was located on the chromosome. The isolation rates of these GES-5 producers increased significantly every year, from 2.0% (6 of 295) in 2012 to 2.8% (8 of 283) in 2013 to 5.3% (16 of 303) in 2014 to 9.7% (29 of 300) in 2015 to 15.3% (45 of 295) in 2016. Of the 104 GES-5 producers, 102 belonged to clonal complex (CC) 235, including 99 belonging to ST235 and three belonging to ST2233). Whole genome sequence analysis revealed that CC235 P. aeruginosa harboring blaGES-5 spread in a clonal manner. These results indicate that these GES-5 producing CC235 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates have spread in medical settings throughout Japan."

We report that de novo mutations in MAST1 cause mega-corpus-callosum syndrome with cerebellar hypoplasia and cortical malformations (MCC-CH-CM) in the absence of megalencephaly. We show that MAST1 is a microtubule-associated protein that is predominantly expressed in post-mitotic neurons and is present in both dendritic and axonal compartments. We further show that Mast1 null animals are phenotypically normal, whereas the deletion of a single amino acid (L278del) recapitulates the distinct neurological phenotype observed in patients. In animals harboring Mast1 microdeletions, we find that the PI3K/AKT3/mTOR pathway is unperturbed, whereas Mast2 and Mast3 levels are diminished, indicative of a dominant-negative mode of action. Finally, we report that de novo MAST1 substitutions are present in patients with autism and microcephaly, raising the prospect that mutations in this gene give rise to a spectrum of neurodevelopmental diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2900794783,"The use of plant essential oils has been shown to efficiently control insect pests of stored beans, significantly reducing the threats associated with synthetic insecticides. Here, we evaluated the potential of applications of essential oils of clove, Syzygium aromaticum L., and cinnamon, Cinnamomum zeylanicum L., to control Callosobruchus maculatus, considered as one of the most cosmopolitan pests of stored beans. Using four combinations of couples (i.e., unexposed couples, exposed females, exposed males, and exposed couples), we also evaluated how sublethal exposure to these essential oils impacted C. maculatus oviposition. Bioassays results revealed that both essential oils exhibited insecticidal activities similar to the synthetic pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin. Furthermore, oil dosage increments proportionately decreased the growth rate and reduced the losses in bean weight caused by cowpea weevils, and offspring emergence was almost abolished when parents were exposed to the LD20 of each essential oil. Finally, significant oviposition impairments were perceived only in couples where females were exposed (i.e., females exposed and exposed couples) to the LD20 of cinnamon and clove essential oils. Thus, by exhibiting similar insecticidal activities as synthetic insecticides and by significantly affecting the oviposition of sublethally exposed C. maculatus females, the cinnamon and clove essential oils represent valuable tools with potential of integration into the management of C. maculatus infestations."
https://openalex.org/W2901679478,"Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) have been linked to tumor progression, particularly membrane-bound CA isoform IX (CA IX). The role of CA IX in the context of breast cancer is to regulate the pH of the tumor microenvironment. In contrast to CA IX, expression of CA XII, specifically in breast cancer, is associated with better outcome despite performing the same catalytic function. In this study, we have structurally modeled the orientation of bound ureido-substituted benzene sulfonamides (USBs) within the active site of CA XII, in comparison to CA IX and cytosolic off-target CA II, to understand isoform specific inhibition. This has identified specific residues within the CA active site, which differ between isoforms that are important for inhibitor binding and isoform specificity. The ability of these sulfonamides to block CA IX activity in breast cancer cells is less effective than their ability to block activity of the recombinant protein (by one to two orders of magnitude depending on the inhibitor). The same is true for CA XII activity but now they are two to three orders of magnitude less effective. Thus, there is significantly greater specificity for CA IX activity over CA XII. While the inhibitors block cell growth, without inducing cell death, this again occurs at two orders of magnitude above the Ki values for inhibition of CA IX and CA XII activity in their respective cell types. Surprisingly, the USBs inhibited cell growth even in cells where CA IX and CA XII expression was ablated. Despite the potential for these sulfonamides as chemotherapeutic agents, these data suggest that we reconsider the role of CA activity on growth potentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2901315291,"Indole is a volatile compound and emitted from plants challenged by insect infestation or mechanic wounding. It has been shown to prime defense against herbivory. Here we identified that indole induced defense either directly or as a priming agent against necrotrophic pathogens Fusarium graminearum and F. moniliforme in maize and Magnaporthe oryzae in rice. With indole pretreatment, smaller lesions were developed in infected leaves, as well as less fungal growth. Indole induced H2O2 burst in the priming stage like other priming substances did. Such priming relied on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which potentially activated downstream defense signaling. In addition, indole priming resulted in earlier and stronger defensive gene expression upon pathogen infection, including genes of jasmonate and phytoalexin biosynthesis, pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs) and anti-oxidant enzymes, which enhanced plant resistance. Meanwhile, H2O2 was also identified as the priming agent to induce plant defense. Taken together, indole exhibited priming function not only against herbivory but also necrotrophic pathogens. The common emission of indole in plants suggests that it plays important roles as the universal and endogenous priming substance in plant defense."
https://openalex.org/W2901147559,"G protein–coupled receptors stimulate Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors that promote mammalian cell migration. Rac and Rho GTPases exert opposing effects on cell morphology and are stimulated downstream of Gβγ and Gα12/13 or Gαq, respectively. These Gα subunits might in turn favor Rho pathways by preventing Gβγ signaling to Rac. Here, we investigated whether Gβγ signaling to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate–dependent Rac exchange factor 1 (P-REX1), a key Gβγ chemotactic effector, is directly controlled by Rho-activating Gα subunits. We show that pharmacological inhibition of Gαq makes P-REX1 activation by Gq/Gi-coupled lysophosphatidic acid receptors more effective. Moreover, chemogenetic control of Gi and Gq by designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) confirmed that Gi differentially activates P-REX1. GTPase-deficient GαqQL and Gα13QL variants formed stable complexes with Gβγ, impairing its interaction with P-REX1. The N-terminal regions of these variants were essential for stable interaction with Gβγ. Pulldown assays revealed that chimeric Gα13-i2QL interacts with Gβγ unlike to Gαi2–13QL, the reciprocal chimera, which similarly to Gαi2QL could not interact with Gβγ. Moreover, Gβγ was part of tetrameric Gβγ–GαqQL–RGS2 and Gβγ–Gα13-i2QL–RGS4 complexes, whereas Gα13QL dissociated from Gβγ to interact with the PDZ–RhoGEF–RGS domain. Consistent with an integrated response, Gβγ and AKT kinase were associated with active SDF-1/CXCL12–stimulated P-REX1. This pathway was inhibited by GαqQL and Gα13QL, which also prevented CXCR4-dependent cell migration. We conclude that a coordinated mechanism prioritizes Gαq- and Gα13-mediated signaling to Rho over a Gβγ-dependent Rac pathway, attributed to heterotrimeric Gi proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2901346397,"Introduction Antenatal care (ANC) has long been considered a critical component of the continuum of care during pregnancy, with the potential to contribute to the survival and thriving of women and newborns. Although ANC utilization has increased in over the past decades, adequate coverage and content of ANC contacts have fallen under increased scrutiny. The objectives of this article are to describe the coverage and content of ANC contacts in the context of rural Bangladesh. Methods A community-based, cross-sectional household survey was conducted in two sub-districts of Netrokona district, Bangladesh in 2016. A total of 737 women with a recent birth outcome were interviewed. Respondents reported on the ANC contacts and the content of these contacts. Descriptive statistics were used to report coverage and content of ANC contacts stratified by covariates. Chi-square tests were performed to explore whether the estimates are different among different categories and significant differences were reported at p<0.05. Results Around 25% of women attended at least four ANC contacts, with only 11% initiating ANC in the first trimester of pregnancy. Blood pressure was measured in almost all of the ANC contacts (92%), and abdominal examination performed in 80% and weight measured in 85% of ANC contacts. Urine tests were conducted in less than half of the ANC contacts, whereas blood screening tests and ultrasound were conducted in 45% contacts. Health care providers counselled women on danger signs in only 66% of the ANC contacts. Overall, the content of facility-based ANC contacts were better than home-based ANC contacts across all components. Conclusions Adequate coverage of ANC remains poor in Netrokona, Bangladesh and important gaps remain in the content of ANC contacts when women attend these services."
https://openalex.org/W2901532089,"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) allows quantitative assessment of transport phenomena in the human nasal cavity, including heat exchange, moisture transport, odorant uptake in the olfactory cleft, and regional delivery of pharmaceutical aerosols. The first step when applying CFD to investigate nasal airflow is to create a 3-dimensional reconstruction of the nasal anatomy from computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance images (MRI). However, a method to identify the exact location of the air-tissue boundary from CT scans or MRI is currently lacking. This introduces some uncertainty in the nasal cavity geometry. The radiodensity threshold for segmentation of the nasal airways has received little attention in the CFD literature. The goal of this study is to quantify how uncertainty in the segmentation threshold impacts CFD simulations of transport phenomena in the human nasal cavity. Three patients with nasal airway obstruction were included in the analysis. Pre-surgery CT scans were obtained after mucosal decongestion with oxymetazoline. For each patient, the nasal anatomy was reconstructed using three different thresholds in Hounsfield units (-800HU, -550HU, and -300HU). Our results demonstrate that some CFD variables (pressure drop, flowrate, airflow resistance) and anatomic variables (airspace cross-sectional area and volume) are strongly dependent on the segmentation threshold, while other CFD variables (intranasal flow distribution, surface area) are less sensitive to the segmentation threshold. These findings suggest that identification of an optimal threshold for segmentation of the nasal airway from CT scans will be important for good agreement between in vivo measurements and patient-specific CFD simulations of transport phenomena in the nasal cavity, particularly for processes sensitive to the transnasal pressure drop. We recommend that future CFD studies should always report the segmentation threshold used to reconstruct the nasal anatomy."
https://openalex.org/W2901380849,"Hydration is one of the most significant issues for combat sports as athletes often use water restriction for quick weight loss before competition. It appears that alkaline water can be an effective alternative to sodium bicarbonate in preventing the effects of exercise-induced metabolic acidosis. Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to investigate, in a double blind, placebo controlled randomized study, the impact of mineral-based highly alkaline water on acid-base balance, hydration status, and anaerobic capacity. Sixteen well trained combat sport athletes (n = 16), were randomly divided into two groups; the experimental group (EG; n = 8), which ingested highly alkaline water for three weeks, and the control group (CG; n = 8), which received regular table water. Anaerobic performance was evaluated by two double 30 s Wingate tests for lower and upper limbs, respectively, with a passive rest interval of 3 minutes between the bouts of exercise. Fingertip capillary blood samples for the assessment of lactate concentration were drawn at rest and during the 3rd min of recovery. In addition, acid-base equilibrium and electrolyte status were evaluated. Urine samples were evaluated for specific gravity and pH. The results indicate that drinking alkalized water enhances hydration, improves acid-base balance and anaerobic exercise performance."

The transport activity of MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 can be facilitated by the extracellular carbonic anhydrase IV (CAIV) via a noncatalytic mechanism. Combining physiological measurements in HEK-293 cells and Xenopus oocytes with pulldown experiments, we analyzed the direct interaction between CAIV and the two MCT chaperones basigin (CD147) and embigin (GP70). Our results show that facilitation of MCT transport activity requires direct binding of CAIV to the transporters chaperones. We found that this binding is mediated by the highly conserved His-88 residue in CAIV, which is also the central residue of the enzyme’s intramolecular proton shuttle, and a charged amino acid residue in the Ig1 domain of the chaperone. Although the position of the CAIV-binding site in the chaperone was conserved, the amino acid residue itself varied among different species. In human CD147, binding of CAIV was mediated by the negatively charged Glu-73 and in rat CD147 by the positively charged Lys-73. In rat GP70, we identified the positively charged Arg-130 as the binding site. Further analysis of the CAIV-binding site revealed that the His-88 in CAIV can either act as H donor or H acceptor for the hydrogen bond, depending on the charge of the binding residue in the chaperone. Our results suggest that the CAIV-mediated increase in MCT transport activity requires direct binding between CAIV–His-88 and a charged amino acid in the extracellular domain of the transporter’s chaperone.

https://openalex.org/W2901691905,"α-Flavone glycosides have beneficial properties for applications in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. However, their chemical syntheses are often limited by a low efficiency or scarcity of substrates. In this study, α-flavone glucosides were enzymatically synthesized by amylosucrase from Deinococcus geothermalis (DGAS) using sucrose and various flavones as a donor for glucosyl units and acceptors, respectively. Luteolin was the most effective acceptor in the transglucosylation reaction using DGAS among nine flavone materials (apigenin, chrysin, 6,7-dihydroxyflavone, homoorientin, 7-hydroxyflavone, isorhoifolin, luteolin, luteolin-3',7-diglucoside, and orientin). The highest production yield of luteolin glucoside was 86%, with a 7:1 molar ratio of donor to acceptor molecules, in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7) at 37°C for 24 h using 2 U of DGAS. The synthesized luteolin glucoside was identified as luteolin-4'-O-α-D-glucopyranoside with a glucose molecule linked to the C-4' position on the B-ring of luteolin via an α-glucosidic bond, as determined by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. This result clearly confirmed that the glucosylated luteolin was successfully synthesized by DGAS and it can be applied as a functional ingredient. Furthermore, this approach using DGAS has the potential to be utilized for the synthesis of various glucosylated products using different types of polyphenols to enhance their functionalities."
https://openalex.org/W2901176735,"The integration of oilfield multidisciplinary ontology is increasingly important for the growth of the Semantic Web. However, current methods encounter performance bottlenecks either in storing data and searching for information when processing large amounts of data. To overcome these challenges, we propose a domain-ontology process based on the Neo4j graph database. In this paper, we focus on data storage and information retrieval of oilfield ontology. We have designed mapping rules from ontology files to regulate the Neo4j database, which can greatly reduce the required storage space. A two-tier index architecture, including object and triad indexing, is used to keep loading times low and match with different patterns for accurate retrieval. Therefore, we propose a retrieval method based on this architecture. Based on our evaluation, the retrieval method can save 13.04% of the storage space and improve retrieval efficiency by more than 30 times compared with the methods of relational databases."

This study aimed to assess the application of previously developed host-specific Bacteroidales quantitative PCR assays to microbial source tracking of river water samples in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. Various types of fecal-source samples, such as raw sewage, secondary-treated sewage of a wastewater treatment plant, and cattle feces, were used for three human-, two ruminant- and two pig-specific Bacteroidales quantitative PCR assays. Our results demonstrated that BacHum, BacR and Pig2Bac assays as suitable human-, ruminant- and pig-specific assays, with an accuracy of 86%, 94% and 77%, respectively. These selected assays were used for microbial source tracking of 63 river water samples collected at nine sites in two river basins. From these sites, there were 48 (76%), 34 (54%) and 9 (14%) positive samples using the BacHum, BacR and Pig2Bac assays, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2900510405,"The identity of tumor-initiating cells in many cancer types is unknown. Tumors often express genes associated with embryonic development, although the contributions of zygotic programs to tumor initiation and formation are poorly understood. Here, we show that regeneration-induced loss of quiescence in p53-deficient muscle stem cells (MuSCs) results in rhabdomyosarcoma formation with 100% penetrance. Genomic analyses of purified tumor cells revealed spontaneous and discrete oncogenic amplifications in MuSCs that drive tumorigenesis, including, but not limited to, the amplification of the cleavage-stage Dux transcription factor (TF) Duxbl. We further found that Dux factors drive an early embryonic gene signature that defines a molecular subtype across a broad range of human cancers. Duxbl initiates tumorigenesis by enforcing a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, and targeted inactivation of Duxbl specifically in Duxbl-expressing tumor cells abolishes their expansion. These findings reveal how regeneration and genomic instability can interact to activate zygotic genes that drive tumor initiation and growth."

Method This is a register-based cohort study. The first trimester screening database including data from 2006 until 2015 was cross-linked with the Swedish Medical Birth Register and the Swedish Register of Total Population. The final study cohort comprised 145,319 pregnancies, out of which 45,859 pregnancies were complicated by overweight or obesity and without pre-gestational diabetes. There were in total 282 stillbirths. Prediction models for stillbirth in pregnancies with overweight or obesity were constructed based on maternal characteristics, pregnancy complications and biochemical markers. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) were calculated, based on logistic regression analyses. Results The prevalence of stillbirth was 1.6/1000 births and 2.6/1000 births in normal weight and overweight/obese women, respectively. The final predictive model had an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.64–0.74) with a sensitivity of 28% at a 90% fixed specificity. Conclusions It is possible to predict 28% of stillbirths in overweight or obese women, at a false positive rate of 10%. In particular, growth-restricted fetuses are at increased risk of stillbirth."

A study by Serebryany et al. identifies a surprising contributor to the eye's oxidative defense in their demonstration that γD-crystallin (HγD) functions as an oxidoreductase and uses disulfide exchange to initiate aggregation of mutant crystallins that mimic oxidative damage. These insights suggest a mechanism by which a dynamic pool of closely packed proteins might avoid oxidation-driven protein-folding traps, providing new avenues to understand the basis of a human disease with global impact."
https://openalex.org/W2901068926,"Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are pluripotent stem cells, which have the ability to differentiate into all three germ layers: mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm. Proper levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) are critical for maintaining pluripotency, as elevated pERK evoked by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor activation results in differentiation of ESCs, while, conversely, reduction of pERK by a MEK inhibitor maintains a pluripotent ground state. However, mechanisms underlying proper control of pERK levels in mouse ESCs are not fully understood. Here, we find that Klf5, a Krüppel-like transcription factor family member, is a component of pERK regulation in mouse ESCs. We show that ERK signaling is overactivated in Klf5-KO ESCs and the overactivated ERK in Klf5-KO ESCs is suppressed by the introduction of Klf5, but not Klf2 or Klf4, indicating a unique role for Klf5 in ERK suppression. Moreover, Klf5 regulates Spred1, a negative regulator of the FGF-ERK pathway. Klf5 also facilitates reprogramming of EpiSCs into a naïve state in combination with a glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitor and LIF, and in place of a MEK inhibitor. Taken together, these results show for the first time that Klf5 has a unique role suppressing ERK activity in mouse ESCs."

It represents the movement of an individual or a device based on the longitude and latitude coordinates collected by GPS. The location based service has a broad application prospect in the real world. As the traditional location prediction models which are based on the discrete state sequence cannot predict the locations in real time, we propose a Continuous Time Series Markov Model (CTS-MM) to solve this problem. The method takes the Gaussian Mixed Model (GMM) to simulate the posterior probability of a location in the continuous time series. The probability calculation method and state transition model of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) are improved to get the precise location prediction. The experimental results on GeoLife data show that CTS-MM performs better for location prediction in exact minute than traditional location prediction models."
https://openalex.org/W2900942983,"The aims of this study were to investigate changes in energy balance-associated metabolites associated with radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer, and to relate these changes to the clinical and pathological response-to-treatment. We studied 151 women with breast cancer who received radiotherapy following surgical excision of the tumor. Blood was obtained before and after the irradiation procedure. The control group was composed of 44 healthy women with a similar age distribution to that of the patients. We analyzed the concentrations of metabolites involved in glycolysis, citric acid cycle and amino acid metabolism using targeted quantitative metabolomics. Post-surgery, pre-radiotherapy, patients had major alterations in the serum concentrations of products of glycolysis, citric acid cycle and amino acid metabolism. The strongest alterations were decreases in serine, leucine and isoleucine concentrations. Alterations in metabolite levels were partially, or totally, reversed after irradiation; the concentrations of serine, leucine and isoleucine approached equivalence to those of the control group. Estrogen receptor-positive patients were those with lower concentrations, while triple negative patients had higher concentrations of these amino acids. The normalization of the amino acids serine, leucine and isoleucine concentrations could be clinically relevant because the normalization of these energy-balance metabolites would suggest that residual micro-metastatic disease had been effectively diminished by the radiotherapy, and may be an indicator of its efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2901205584,"Mineral-associated organic matter is associated with a suite of soil minerals that can confer stability, resulting in the potential for long-term storage of carbon (C). Not all interactions impart the same level of protection, however; evidence is suggesting that C in certain mineral pools is dynamic and vulnerable to disturbance in the decades following harvesting. The objective of this research was to describe and characterize organic matter-mineral interactions through depth in horizons of soils of contrasting stand age. Sequential selective dissolutions representing increasingly stable mineral-associated organic matter pools from water soluble minerals (deionized water), organo-metal complexes (Na-pyrophosphate), poorly-crystalline minerals (HCl hydroxylamine), and crystalline secondary minerals (Na-dithionite HCl)) were carried out for Ae, Bf and BC horizons sampled from a Young and Mature forest site (35 and 110 years post-harvest) in Mooseland, Nova Scotia, Canada. Sequential selective dissolution extracts were analyzed for C, δ13C, iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al). Organo-metal complexes (OMC) were the largest mineral-associated OM pool in all horizons. This pool dominated the C distribution in B horizons (~60-70% of Bf bulk C), with a minor contribution from poorly-crystalline (PCrys), crystalline (Crys) minerals and water soluble (WS) associations. C in OMC and PCrys pools explained the variation in bulk C in horizons through depth at both sites. Twice as much C in OMC pools was measured at the Mature site compared to the Young site in the Bf horizons, supported by higher C:(Fe+Al) ratios. Isotopic analysis indicated that this extraction procedure isolated distinct mineral-associated OM pools. δ13C signatures of pyrophosphate-extracted OMC pools ranged from -27‰ to -28‰, similar to δ13C of bulk C and to plant-derived humic acids and associated biomass. The water soluble phase (mean δ13C = -29 ‰) was up to 2 ‰ more depleted, whereas the δ13C of Crys pools were more enriched in 13C (-13‰ to -16 ‰) compared to bulk soil. The results from this study suggest that association with minerals does not necessarily confer stability: organo-metal pools dominate in podzol horizons through depth, and contribute most to C storage, but are potentially susceptible to destabilization following the physical changes resulting from forest harvesting disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W2901273185,"While foetal distress is typically associated with ischaemic injury, few studies have assessed neonatal morbidity for emergency caesarean section. Moreover, the decision of the anaesthetic technique may be of paramount importance in emergency caesareans, because of the limited time and increased risk. We aimed to evaluate the effect of the anaesthetic technique on neonatal morbidity in emergency caesarean indicated for foetal distress.This was a single-centre, prospective observational study, conducted between July-2015 and December-2015. The study enrolled parturient with indication for emergency caesarean section after diagnosis of foetal distress, who received either regional or general anaesthesia. The outcome measures were: 1, 5-minute Apgar scores; umbilical blood pH; length of hospitalization; and morbidity, defined as a 5-minute Apgar score <7, need for mechanical ventilation, admittance to a neonatal intensive care unit, or respiratory insufficiency symptoms.61 patients were included in the study, of whom 31 received regional anaesthesia. Neonatal morbidity was noted in 5 and 9 cases with regional and general anaesthesia, respectively. The 1-minute Apgar score was significantly lower(p = 0,045) for cases with general anaesthesia, which was not true for the 5-minute Apgar score. Regional anaesthesia was non-significantly associated with shorter length of hospitalization, lower incidence of morbidity, and higher umbilical blood pH. When we take regional anaesthesia cases as a reference point, we detected that general anaesthesia cases are showing 2,2 times more morbidity risk. But these results did not reach any statistically significant levels.While we did find some improved results for regional anaesthesia group, we found no statistical evidence that neither anaesthesia technique is superior regarding neonatal morbidity. We think that regional anaesthesia should be preferred whenever possible because of our improved results of length of hospital stay, APGAR and morbidity and we think that general anaesthesia is indicated for very urgent cases or regional anaesthesia contraindicated patients.http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN15181117."

Our objectives were to describe the composition and structure of community care networks surrounding integrated treatment programs in selected communities in Ontario, Canada. We used a two-stage snowball method to collect network data from 5 purposively selected integrated treatment programs in communities in Ontario. Front-line staff with integrated treatment programs identified their top 5 service partners, who were then contacted and asked to provide the same information (n = 30). We used social network analysis to measure the cohesiveness, reciprocity, and betweenness centrality in the integrated treatment program’s ego network. We described network composition in terms of representation of different service types. Across communities, common service partners were child protection, substance use or mental health services, parenting and child support, and other social services. Primary and pre-natal care, opioid agonist therapy, and legal services were rarely named as partners. Networks varied in network cohesiveness, as indicated by connectivity between the service partners and reciprocal ties to the integrated treatment programs. Integrated treatment programs commonly brokered the connections between other service partners. Findings suggest that these integrated treatment programs have achieved a level of success in developing cross-sectoral partnerships, with child protection services, parenting and child support, and social services featuring prominently in the networks. In contrast, there was a lack of close connections with physician-based services, highlighting a potential target for future quality improvement initiatives in this sector."
https://openalex.org/W2901704894,"Background In patients with refractory heart failure (HF) peritoneal dialysis (PD) is associated with improved functional status and decrease in hospitalization. However, previous studies did not focus on right ventricular dysfunction as an important pathophysiologic component of cardiorenal syndrome. Methods In a prospective cohort study PD was started in 40 patients with refractory right HF (with/without left HF). Refractoriness to conservative therapy was defined as persistent right heart congestion/ascites with intensified diuretic treatment and/or ≥2 hospitalizations within 6 months because of cardiac decompensation despite optimal medical treatment, and/or acute renal failure during intensified conservative treatment of cardiac decompensations. Results Patient survival was 55.0% at 1 year, 35.0% at 2 years and 27.5% at 3 years. The number of hospitalization days declined after initiation of PD for both cardiac [13 (IQR 1–53) days before vs. 1 (IQR 0–12) days after start of PD, p<0.001] and unplanned reasons [12 (IQR 3–44) days before vs. 1 (IQR 0–33) days after start of PD, p = 0.007]. Using a combined endpoint including survival time of ≥1 year and either improvement in quality of life or decline in hospitalizations we found that patients with extended ascites, higher systolic pulmonary artery pressure, more marked impairment of right ventricular function and tricuspid valve insufficiency, higher residual renal function as well as those who could perform PD without assistance have benefited most from this therapy. Conclusions Patients with more pronounced backward failure, less marked residual renal functional impairment and those not depending on assistance for therapy are likely to profit most from PD."

Therefore, the aim is to estimate this relation in the Swedish adult population of 2015. For that purpose, the first step was to establishit for adult male and female cycle commuters in Greater Stockholm, Sweden. Whether or not the slopes of these relations needed to be altered in order to make them representative of the general population was evaluated by comparing the levels of maximal oxygen uptake in samples of commuter cyclists and the population. The measure used was the maximal oxygen uptake divided by both the body weight and a cycle weight of 18.5 kg. The body weights in the population samples were adjusted to mirror relevant levels in 2015. Age adjustments for the duration–distance relations were calculated on the basis of the maximal oxygen uptake in the population samples aged 20–65 years. The duration-distance relations of the cycle commuters were downscaled by about 24–28% to mirror levels in the general population. The empirical formula for the distance (D, km) was based on duration (T, minutes) · speed (km/min) · a correction factor from cycle commuter to the general population · age adjustment (A, years). For the males in the general population the formula was: D = T · 20.76 km/h · 0.719 · (1.676–0.0147 · A). For females, the formula was: D = T · 16.14 km/h · 0.763 · (1.604–0.0129 · A). These formulas, combined with distributions of route distances between home and work in the population, enable realistic evaluations of the potential for different public health outcomes through cycle commuting."

Phosphorylated XRCC1 stimulates PNKP by binding to its forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, whereas nonphosphorylated XRCC1 stimulates PNKP by interacting with the PNKP catalytic domain. Here, we have further studied the interactions between these two proteins, including two variants of XRCC1 (R194W and R280H) arising from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been associated with elevated cancer risk in some reports. We observed that interaction of the PNKP FHA domain with phosphorylated XRCC1 extends beyond the immediate, well-characterized phosphorylated region of XRCC1 (residues 515–526). We also found that an XRCC1 fragment, comprising residues 166–436, binds tightly to PNKP and DNA and efficiently activates PNKP’s kinase activity. However, interaction of either of the SNP-derived variants of this fragment with PNKP was considerably weaker, and their stimulation of PNKP was severely reduced, although they still could bind DNA effectively. Laser microirradiation revealed reduced recruitment of PNKP to damaged DNA in cells expressing either XRCC1 variant compared with PNKP recruitment in cells expressing WT XRCC1 even though WT and variant XRCC1s were equally efficient at localizing to the damaged DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2901397444,"Introduction For immune cells transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) can enhance or repress effector functions. Here, we characterize the effects of TGF-β1 on IgE-mediated and IL-33-mediated activation of primary murine mast cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells (bone marrow derived mast cells; BMMC). We also investigated potential interactions between TGF-β1 and stem cell factor (SCF). We conclude TGF-β1 plays a selectively stimulatory role for mast cell cultures in vitro. Methods BMMCs from C57BL/6 mice were differentiated with IL-3 and then treated with TGF-β1. BMMCs were exposed to TGF-β1, primed with IgE, activated with antigen, and then IL-6 and IL-13 cytokine release was quantified using ELISA. Additionally, the effects of TGF-β1 on both IgE and IL-33-mediated short term activation were observed via flow cytometric analysis of both surface LAMP-1 expression and intracellular IL-6. Receptor colocalization was visualized using fluorescence confocal microscopy and individual receptor expression levels were also quantified. Results Resting IL-6 production increased with TGF-β1 but significance was lost following BMMC activation via IgE receptor (FcεRI) crosslinking. This was similar to a comparison effect due to SCF treatment alone, which also enhanced resting levels of IL-6. TGF-β1 treatment enhanced release of IL-13 only with FcεRI-IgE-mediated activation. TGF-β1 suppressed mobilization of IL-6 with short-term BMMC activation when stimulated with IL-33. Lastly, colocalization patterns of the SCF receptor (CD117) and FcεRI with IgE crosslinking were unaffected by TGF-β1 treatment, but individual expression levels for FcεRI, CD117, and TGFβRII were all reduced following either IgE activation or TGF-β1 treatment; this reduction was partially recovered in BMMCs that were both activated by IgE and treated with TGF-β1. Discussion These data reveal a novel positive effect of soluble TGF-β1 on mast cell activation in vitro, suggesting mast cells may be activated through a non-canonical pathway by TGF-β1. Understanding this interaction will provide insight into the potential role of mast cells in settings where TGF-β1 is produced in an aberrant manner, such as in and around high grade tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2901705556,"Adenosine deaminase (ADA) catalyzes the deamination of adenosine, which is important in purine metabolism. ADA is ubiquitous to almost all human tissues, and ADA abnormalities have been reported in various diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. ADA can be divided into two conformations based on the inhibitor that it binds to: open and closed forms. Here, we chose three ligands, namely, FR117016 (FR0), FR221647 (FR2) (open form), and HDPR (PRH, closed form), to investigate the inhibition mechanism of ADA and its effect on ADA through molecular dynamics simulations. In open forms, Egap and electrostatic potential (ESP) indicated that electron transfer might occur more easily in FR0 than in FR2. Binding free energy and hydrogen bond occupation revealed that the ADA-FR0 complex had a more stable structure than ADA-FR2. The probability of residues Pro159 to Lys171 of ADA-FR0 and ADA-FR2 to form a helix moderately increased compared with that in nonligated ADA. In comparison with FR0 and FR2 PRH could maintain ADA in a closed form to inhibit the function of ADA. The α7 helix (residues Thr57 to Ala73) of ADA in the closed form was mostly unfastened because of the effect of PRH. The number of H bonds and the relative superiority of the binding free energy indicated that the binding strength of PRH to ADA was significantly lower than that of an open inhibitor, thereby supporting the comparison of the inhibitory activities of the three ligands. Alanine scanning results showed that His17, Gly184, Asp295, and Asp296 exerted the greatest effects on protein energy, suggesting that they played crucial roles in binding to inhibitors. This study served as a theoretical basis for the development of new ADA inhibitors."

In sarcoidosis, the CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly more elevated in lymph nodes than in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (P<0.001), although both were strongly correlated. The CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly higher in stage I than in stage II both in the BAL fluid and lymph nodes. When compared with lung cancer lymph node metastasis, the CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly higher in sarcoidosis, whereas the CD3/CD19 ratio was significantly higher in lung cancer. The proportion of regulatory T cells (CD4+, CD25+, FoxP3 high) did not differ between sarcoidosis and lung cancer samples. Lymphocyte profiles in mediastinal lymphadenopathy can be analyzed by flow cytometry of EBUS-TBNA samples. These findings might help elucidate the immunopathology of sarcoidosis."

Here, we report the generation, in vitro characterization and anti-tumor effectivity of a new bicistronic xenogenic DNA vaccine encoding tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) that is highly expressed in NB tumors, and the immune stimulating cytokine interleukin 15 (IL-15) that induces cytotoxic but not regulatory T cells. The DNA sequences of TH linked to ubiquitin and of IL-15 were integrated into the bicistronic expression vector pIRES. Successful production and bioactivity of the vaccine-derived IL-15- and TH protein were shown by ELISA, bioactivity assay and western blot analysis. Further, DNA vaccine-driven gene transfer to the antigen presenting cells of Peyer's patches using attenuated Salmonella typhimurium that served as oral delivery system was shown by immunofluorescence analysis. The anti-tumor effect of the generated vaccine was evaluated in a syngeneic mouse model (A/J mice, n = 12) after immunization with S. typhimurium (3× prior and 3× after tumor implantation). Importantly, TH-/IL-15-based DNA vaccination resulted in an enhanced tumor remission in 45.5% of mice compared to controls (TH (16.7%), IL-15 (0%)) and reduced spontaneous metastasis (30.0%) compared to controls (TH (63.6%), IL-15 (70.0%)). Interestingly, similar levels of tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells were observed among all experimental groups. Finally, co-expression of IL-15 did not result in elevated regulatory T cell levels in tumor environment measured by flow cytometry. In conclusion, co-expression of the stimulatory cytokine IL-15 enhanced the NB-specific anti-tumor effectivity of a TH-directed vaccination in mice and may provide a novel immunological approach for NB patients."
https://openalex.org/W2901565429,"Single-cell analyses are propelling us ever closer to answering questions that have long-motivated research in cell and developmental biology. What is the range of cellular diversity? What defines a cell type? How do cell types evolve and differ between species? And how do individual cells of a given cell type differ from each other and for what purposes? Recent achievements offer glimpses of the vast panorama emerging from this rapidly moving field. Cell atlases are one foundational pillar of these efforts with new studies providing an in-depth look at cell type diversity in mice. The recently reported Tabula Muris used two approaches to analyze tens of thousands of cells: one approach is based on microfluidics and the other is based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018Tabula Muris ConsortiumOverall coordinationLogistical coordinationOrgan collection and processingLibrary preparation and sequencingComputational data analysisCell type annotationWriting groupSupplemental text writing groupPrincipal investigatorsSingle-cell transcriptomics of 20 mouse organs creates a Tabula Muris.Nature. 2018; 562: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Both approaches enabled creation of a map of cell types across 20 organs, with the FACS approach capable of detecting a greater number of genes per cell. A value of the characterizations of cellular identity based on gene expression is that it allows for gene regulatory networks that underpin them to be uncovered. These vast and valuable data join those reported earlier this year by Han et al., 2018Han X. Wang R. Zhou Y. Fei L. Sun H. Lai S. Saadatpour A. Zhou Z. Chen H. Ye F. et al.Mapping the Mouse Cell Atlas by Microwell-Seq.Cell. 2018; 172: 1091-1107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, who used microwell-seq to analyze 400,000 cells from across the major organs of the mouse, including fetal and neonatal tissue. These atlases provide a foundation for the discovery of new cellular and systemic insights into disease once the many mouse models of illness are examined in similar depth. Future work will also likely examine the fascinating changes that occur in aging, particularly with respect to tissue-specific alterations in cellular heterogeneity. Heterogeneity also typifies cellular responses to pathogen infection. Hagai et al., 2018Hagai T. Chen X. Miragaia R.J. Rostom R. Gomes T. Kunowska N. Henriksson J. Park J.-E. Proserpio V. Donati G. et al.Gene expression variability across cells and species shapes innate immunity.Nature. 2018; (Published online October 24, 2018)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0657-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar now delve deep into the inter-species and cellular basis for this by examining single-cell response of two cell types—dermal fibroblasts and mononuclear phagocytes from a variety of species—to challenge by a synthetic double-stranded RNA to mimic viral infection and lipopolysaccharide to simulate bacterial infection. With this information, they identify genes involved in the innate immune response whose expression levels diverge between species and show these are enriched for cytokines. Interestingly, these same genes are also shown to be more variable between cells within a species. The molecular basis for this heterogeneity is shown to be linked to the presence of TATA box in promoters of more highly variable genes, while the presence of CpG-islands in promoters is associated with less variable expression. This suggests that TATA box containing promoters have been selected in vertebrate evolution to tune tissue-wide responses such that only some cells will encode cytokines to elicit a controlled tissue-wide defense. It would be reasonable to presume that expression variability between single cells could be related to differences in promoter accessibility and nucleosome positioning at those genes. Lai et al., 2018Lai B. Gao W. Cui K. Xie W. Tang Q. Jin W. Hu G. Ni B. Zhao K. Principles of nucleosome organization revealed by single-cell micrococcal nuclease sequencing.Nature. 2018; 562: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar now introduce a technique that combines FACS, micrococcal nuclease digestion to cleave DNA between nucleosomes, and DNA fragment sequencing. This makes it possible to simultaneously reveal nucleosome positioning and chromatin accessibility in single cells. This assessment, which included hundreds of individual cells from three different mouse cell types, reveals insights that were previously masked by bulk analyses. The first is that nucleosomes around transcriptional start sites in silent parts of the genome are regularly spaced, but their position between individual cells varies considerably. In contrast, nucleosomes at start sites in actively transcribed regions have more heterogeneity in spacing but are positioned more precisely. These would appear to represent differences in chromatin stability and the activity of chromatin remodeling factors in the active regions. The authors show that spacing between nucleosomes is bimodal, with peaks at 190bp and 300 bp, which correlate with differential accessibility. Moreover, variation in gene expression is shown to be correlated to variation in nucleosome positioning. The authors expand this assessment to tackle questions related to differentiation and intriguingly imply that the heterogeneity observed in cultured naive CD4 T cells and embryonic stem cells in the presence or absence of nucleosomes at key enhancers marks cells primed for differentiation. Another factor that could impact variability between cells is the more mysterious role that 3D organization plays, particularly at the level of topologically associated domains (TADs). TADs are neighboring regions (or domains) of chromosomes within which chromatin shows higher contact probabilities than those of inter-domain contacts. Although these have been examined in bulk and in a pairwise fashion, until now, there has not been a way of assessing them in a widespread manner in individual cells. In this context, the effort by Bintu et al., 2018Bintu B. Mateo L.J. Su J.-H. Sinnott-Armstrong N.A. Parker M. Kinrot S. Yamaya K. Botettiger A.N. Zhuang X. Single-resolution chromatin tracing reveals domains and cooperative interactions in single cells.Science. 2018; 362https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aau1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar employs sequential hybridization with 30 kb readout probes (a multiplex adaptation of fluorescence in situ hybridization), which enables tracing of large regions of chromatin and their comparison between cells. They find that TAD-like chromatin domain structures are present in single cells. Although the boundaries of these TAD-like structures differ between cells and could be present at all locations in the genome, they do appear to be preferentially placed near CTCF and cohesin binding sites. However, TAD-like structures are still present in single cells even when cohesin is depleted, an observation that is not evident from existing studies of chromatin at the population-average level. In having this more expansive and intricate view of chromatin organization, the authors reveal that three-way interactions between chromatin segments are commonplace. In future work, it will be interesting to determine whether stereotypy or variability in these associations can be linked to specific impacts on gene expression or cellular responses. There is an increasingly impressive array of new tools with which to explore individual cells. Beyond the richness of data that comes from each of these efforts, cross-comparison and merging of insights from multiple platforms becomes an increasingly urgent task. In addition, many of these approaches are also in principle compatible with widescale CRISPR editing and screening tools, and it may become commonplace to characterize specific single cell phenotypes while simultaneously identifying modulators of their frequency."
