https://openalex.org/W3135108774,"Reports of long-lasting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, the so-called ‘long COVID’, are rising but little is known about prevalence, risk factors or whether it is possible to predict a protracted course early in the disease. We analyzed data from 4,182 incident cases of COVID-19 in which individuals self-reported their symptoms prospectively in the COVID Symptom Study app1. A total of 558 (13.3%) participants reported symptoms lasting ≥28 days, 189 (4.5%) for ≥8 weeks and 95 (2.3%) for ≥12 weeks. Long COVID was characterized by symptoms of fatigue, headache, dyspnea and anosmia and was more likely with increasing age and body mass index and female sex. Experiencing more than five symptoms during the first week of illness was associated with long COVID (odds ratio = 3.53 (2.76–4.50)). A simple model to distinguish between short COVID and long COVID at 7 days (total sample size, n = 2,149) showed an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve of 76%, with replication in an independent sample of 2,472 individuals who were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. This model could be used to identify individuals at risk of long COVID for trials of prevention or treatment and to plan education and rehabilitation services."
https://openalex.org/W3135815505,"The plant immune system involves cell-surface receptors that detect intercellular pathogen-derived molecules, and intracellular receptors that activate immunity upon detection of pathogen-secreted effector proteins that act inside the plant cell. Immunity mediated by surface receptors has been extensively studied1, but that mediated by intracellular receptors has rarely been investigated in the absence of surface-receptor-mediated immunity. Furthermore, interactions between these two immune pathways are poorly understood. Here, by activating intracellular receptors without inducing surface-receptor-mediated immunity, we analyse interactions between these two distinct immune systems in Arabidopsis. Pathogen recognition by surface receptors activates multiple protein kinases and NADPH oxidases, and we find that intracellular receptors primarily potentiate the activation of these proteins by increasing their abundance through several mechanisms. Likewise, the hypersensitive response that depends on intracellular receptors is strongly enhanced by the activation of surface receptors. Activation of either immune system alone is insufficient to provide effective resistance against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Thus, immune pathways activated by cell-surface and intracellular receptors in plants mutually potentiate to activate strong defences against pathogens. These findings reshape our understanding of plant immunity and have broad implications for crop improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3114175353,"Displays are basic building blocks of modern electronics1,2. Integrating displays into textiles offers exciting opportunities for smart electronic textiles—the ultimate goal of wearable technology, poised to change the way in which we interact with electronic devices3,4,5,6. Display textiles serve to bridge human–machine interactions7,8,9, offering, for instance, a real-time communication tool for individuals with voice or speech difficulties. Electronic textiles capable of communicating10, sensing11,12 and supplying electricity13,14 have been reported previously. However, textiles with functional, large-area displays have not yet been achieved, because it is challenging to obtain small illuminating units that are both durable and easy to assemble over a wide area. Here we report a 6-metre-long, 25-centimetre-wide display textile containing 5 × 105 electroluminescent units spaced approximately 800 micrometres apart. Weaving conductive weft and luminescent warp fibres forms micrometre-scale electroluminescent units at the weft–warp contact points. The brightness between electroluminescent units deviates by less than 8 per cent and remains stable even when the textile is bent, stretched or pressed. Our display textile is flexible and breathable and withstands repeated machine-washing, making it suitable for practical applications. We show that an integrated textile system consisting of display, keyboard and power supply can serve as a communication tool, demonstrating the system’s potential within the ‘internet of things’ in various areas, including healthcare. Our approach unifies the fabrication and function of electronic devices with textiles, and we expect that woven-fibre materials will shape the next generation of electronics."
https://openalex.org/W3135339687,"The plant immune system is fundamental for plant survival in natural ecosystems and for productivity in crop fields. Substantial evidence supports the prevailing notion that plants possess a two-tiered innate immune system, called pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI). PTI is triggered by microbial patterns via cell surface-localized pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), whereas ETI is activated by pathogen effector proteins via predominantly intracellularly localized receptors called nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs)1-4. PTI and ETI are initiated by distinct activation mechanisms and involve different early signalling cascades5,6. Here we show that Arabidopsis PRR and PRR co-receptor mutants-fls2 efr cerk1 and bak1 bkk1 cerk1 triple mutants-are markedly impaired in ETI responses when challenged with incompatible Pseudomonas syrinage bacteria. We further show that the production of reactive oxygen species by the NADPH oxidase RBOHD is a critical early signalling event connecting PRR- and NLR-mediated immunity, and that the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BIK1 is necessary for full activation of RBOHD, gene expression and bacterial resistance during ETI. Moreover, NLR signalling rapidly augments the transcript and/or protein levels of key PTI components. Our study supports a revised model in which potentiation of PTI is an indispensable component of ETI during bacterial infection. This revised model conceptually unites two major immune signalling cascades in plants and mechanistically explains some of the long-observed similarities in downstream defence outputs between PTI and ETI."
https://openalex.org/W3132982761,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Although passively delivered neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 show promise in clinical trials, their mechanism of action in vivo is incompletely understood. Here, we define correlates of protection of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. Whereas Fc effector functions are dispensable when representative neutralizing mAbs are administered as prophylaxis, they are required for optimal protection as therapy. When given after infection, intact mAbs reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden and lung disease in mice and hamsters better than loss-of-function Fc variant mAbs. Fc engagement of neutralizing antibodies mitigates inflammation and improves respiratory mechanics, and transcriptional profiling suggests these phenotypes are associated with diminished innate immune signaling and preserved tissue repair. Immune cell depletions establish that neutralizing mAbs require monocytes and CD8+ T cells for optimal clinical and virological benefit. Thus, potently neutralizing mAbs utilize Fc effector functions during therapy to mitigate lung infection and disease."

https://openalex.org/W3134146960,"The ability to present three-dimensional (3D) scenes with continuous depth sensation has a profound impact on virtual and augmented reality, human–computer interaction, education and training. Computer-generated holography (CGH) enables high-spatio-angular-resolution 3D projection via numerical simulation of diffraction and interference1. Yet, existing physically based methods fail to produce holograms with both per-pixel focal control and accurate occlusion2,3. The computationally taxing Fresnel diffraction simulation further places an explicit trade-off between image quality and runtime, making dynamic holography impractical4. Here we demonstrate a deep-learning-based CGH pipeline capable of synthesizing a photorealistic colour 3D hologram from a single RGB-depth image in real time. Our convolutional neural network (CNN) is extremely memory efficient (below 620 kilobytes) and runs at 60 hertz for a resolution of 1,920 × 1,080 pixels on a single consumer-grade graphics processing unit. Leveraging low-power on-device artificial intelligence acceleration chips, our CNN also runs interactively on mobile (iPhone 11 Pro at 1.1 hertz) and edge (Google Edge TPU at 2.0 hertz) devices, promising real-time performance in future-generation virtual and augmented-reality mobile headsets. We enable this pipeline by introducing a large-scale CGH dataset (MIT-CGH-4K) with 4,000 pairs of RGB-depth images and corresponding 3D holograms. Our CNN is trained with differentiable wave-based loss functions5 and physically approximates Fresnel diffraction. With an anti-aliasing phase-only encoding method, we experimentally demonstrate speckle-free, natural-looking, high-resolution 3D holograms. Our learning-based approach and the Fresnel hologram dataset will help to unlock the full potential of holography and enable applications in metasurface design6,7, optical and acoustic tweezer-based microscopic manipulation8–10, holographic microscopy11 and single-exposure volumetric 3D printing12,13. A deep-learning-based approach using a convolutional neural network is used to synthesize photorealistic colour three-dimensional holograms from a single RGB-depth image in real time, and termed tensor holography."
https://openalex.org/W3133632560,"Placentas can exhibit chromosomal aberrations that are absent from the fetus1. The basis of this genetic segregation, which is known as confined placental mosaicism, remains unknown. Here we investigated the phylogeny of human placental cells as reconstructed from somatic mutations, using whole-genome sequencing of 86 bulk placental samples (with a median weight of 28 mg) and of 106 microdissections of placental tissue. We found that every bulk placental sample represents a clonal expansion that is genetically distinct, and exhibits a genomic landscape akin to that of childhood cancer in terms of mutation burden and mutational imprints. To our knowledge, unlike any other healthy human tissue studied so far, the placental genomes often contained changes in copy number. We reconstructed phylogenetic relationships between tissues from the same pregnancy, which revealed that developmental bottlenecks genetically isolate placental tissues by separating trophectodermal lineages from lineages derived from the inner cell mass. Notably, there were some cases with full segregation-within a few cell divisions of the zygote-of placental lineages and lineages derived from the inner cell mass. Such early embryonic bottlenecks may enable the normalization of zygotic aneuploidy. We observed direct evidence for this in a case of mosaic trisomic rescue. Our findings reveal extensive mutagenesis in placental tissues and suggest that mosaicism is a typical feature of placental development."
https://openalex.org/W3135803532,"The genome-wide architecture of chromatin-associated proteins that maintains chromosome integrity and gene regulation is not well defined. Here we use chromatin immunoprecipitation, exonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing (ChIP–exo/seq)1,2 to define this architecture in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identify 21 meta-assemblages consisting of roughly 400 different proteins that are related to DNA replication, centromeres, subtelomeres, transposons and transcription by RNA polymerase (Pol) I, II and III. Replication proteins engulf a nucleosome, centromeres lack a nucleosome, and repressive proteins encompass three nucleosomes at subtelomeric X-elements. We find that most promoters associated with Pol II evolved to lack a regulatory region, having only a core promoter. These constitutive promoters comprise a short nucleosome-free region (NFR) adjacent to a +1 nucleosome, which together bind the transcription-initiation factor TFIID to form a preinitiation complex. Positioned insulators protect core promoters from upstream events. A small fraction of promoters evolved an architecture for inducibility, whereby sequence-specific transcription factors (ssTFs) create a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) that is distinct from an NFR. We describe structural interactions among ssTFs, their cognate cofactors and the genome. These interactions include the nucleosomal and transcriptional regulators RPD3-L, SAGA, NuA4, Tup1, Mediator and SWI–SNF. Surprisingly, we do not detect interactions between ssTFs and TFIID, suggesting that such interactions do not stably occur. Our model for gene induction involves ssTFs, cofactors and general factors such as TBP and TFIIB, but not TFIID. By contrast, constitutive transcription involves TFIID but not ssTFs engaged with their cofactors. From this, we define a highly integrated network of gene regulation by ssTFs. A ChIP–exo method is used to define the genome-wide positional organization of proteins associated with gene transcription, DNA replication, centromeres, subtelomeres and transposons, revealing distinct protein assemblies for constitutive and inducible gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W3133779704,"Increasing demand for algorithms that can learn quickly and efficiently has led to a surge of development within the field of artificial intelligence (AI). An important paradigm within AI is reinforcement learning (RL), where agents interact with environments by exchanging signals via a communication channel. Agents can learn by updating their behaviour based on obtained feedback. The crucial question for practical applications is how fast agents can learn to respond correctly. An essential figure of merit is therefore the learning time. While various works have made use of quantum mechanics to speed up the agent's decision-making process, a reduction in learning time has not been demonstrated yet. Here we present a RL experiment where the learning of an agent is boosted by utilizing a quantum communication channel with the environment. We further show that the combination with classical communication enables the evaluation of such an improvement, and additionally allows for optimal control of the learning progress. This novel scenario is therefore demonstrated by considering hybrid agents, that alternate between rounds of quantum and classical communication. We implement this learning protocol on a compact and fully tunable integrated nanophotonic processor. The device interfaces with telecom-wavelength photons and features a fast active feedback mechanism, allowing us to demonstrate the agent's systematic quantum advantage in a setup that could be readily integrated within future large-scale quantum communication networks."
https://openalex.org/W3135040737,"Abstract Human capital—that is, resources associated with the knowledge and skills of individuals—is a critical component of economic development 1,2 . Learning metrics that are comparable for countries globally are necessary to understand and track the formation of human capital. The increasing use of international achievement tests is an important step in this direction 3 . However, such tests are administered primarily in developed countries 4 , limiting our ability to analyse learning patterns in developing countries that may have the most to gain from the formation of human capital. Here we bridge this gap by constructing a globally comparable database of 164 countries from 2000 to 2017. The data represent 98% of the global population and developing economies comprise two-thirds of the included countries. Using this dataset, we show that global progress in learning—a priority Sustainable Development Goal—has been limited, despite increasing enrolment in primary and secondary education. Using an accounting exercise that includes a direct measure of schooling quality, we estimate that the role of human capital in explaining income differences across countries ranges from a fifth to half; this result has an intermediate position in the wide range of estimates provided in earlier papers in the literature 5–13 . Moreover, we show that average estimates mask considerable heterogeneity associated with income grouping across countries and regions. This heterogeneity highlights the importance of including countries at various stages of economic development when analysing the role of human capital in economic development. Finally, we show that our database provides a measure of human capital that is more closely associated with economic growth than current measures that are included in the Penn world tables version 9.0 14 and the human development index of the United Nations 15 ."

However, data on IPC compliance among healthcare workers in COVID-19 treatment centers are unknown in Ghana. This study aims to assess IPC compliance among healthcare workers in Ghana’s COVID-19 treatment centers. The study was a secondary analysis of data, which was initially collected to determine the level of risk of COVID-19 virus infection among healthcare workers in Ghana. Quantitative data were conveniently collected using the WHO COVID-19 risk assessment tool. We analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses. We observed that IPC compliance during healthcare interactions was 88.4% for hand hygiene and 90.6% for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) usage; IPC compliance while performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), was 97.5% for hand hygiene and 97.5% for PPE usage. For hand hygiene during healthcare interactions, lower compliance was seen among nonclinical staff [OR (odds ratio): 0.43; 95% CI (Confidence interval): 0.21–0.89], and healthcare workers with secondary level qualification (OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.08–0.71). Midwives (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.09–0.93) and Pharmacists (OR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.02–0.92) compliance with hand hygiene was significantly lower than registered nurses. For PPE usage during healthcare interactions, lower compliance was seen among healthcare workers who were separated/divorced/widowed (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01–0.43), those with secondary level qualifications (OR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01–0.43), non-clinical staff (OR 0.16 95% CI 0.07–0.35), cleaners (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.05–0.52), pharmacists (OR: 0.07; 95% CI: 0.01–0.49) and among healthcare workers who reported of insufficiency of PPEs (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.14–0.77). Generally, healthcare workers’ infection prevention and control compliance were high, but this compliance differs across the different groups of health professionals in the treatment centers. Ensuring an adequate supply of IPC logistics coupled with behavior change interventions and paying particular attention to nonclinical staff is critical in minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the treatment centers."
https://openalex.org/W3132138730,"The biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) requirement to culture severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a bottleneck for research. Here, we report a trans-complementation system that produces single-round infectious SARS-CoV-2 that recapitulates authentic viral replication. We demonstrate that the single-round infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be used at BSL-2 laboratories for high-throughput neutralization and antiviral testing. The trans-complementation system consists of two components: a genomic viral RNA containing ORF3 and envelope gene deletions, as well as mutated transcriptional regulator sequences, and a producer cell line expressing the two deleted genes. Trans-complementation of the two components generates virions that can infect naive cells for only one round but does not produce wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Hamsters and K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with the complementation-derived virions exhibited no detectable disease, even after intracranial inoculation with the highest possible dose. Thus, the trans-complementation platform can be safely used at BSL-2 laboratories for research and countermeasure development."

https://openalex.org/W3135033750,"The output of the retina is organized into many detector grids, called ‘mosaics’, that signal different features of visual scenes to the brain1–4. Each mosaic comprises a single type of retinal ganglion cell (RGC), whose receptive fields tile visual space. Many mosaics arise as pairs, signalling increments (ON) and decrements (OFF), respectively, of a particular visual feature5. Here we use a model of efficient coding6 to determine how such mosaic pairs should be arranged to optimize the encoding of natural scenes. We find that information is maximized when these mosaic pairs are anti-aligned, meaning that the distances between the receptive field centres across mosaics are greater than expected by chance. We tested this prediction across multiple receptive field mosaics acquired using large-scale measurements of the light responses of rat and primate RGCs. ON and OFF RGC pairs with similar feature selectivity had anti-aligned receptive field mosaics, consistent with this prediction. ON and OFF RGC types that encode distinct features have independent mosaics. These results extend efficient coding theory beyond individual cells to predict how populations of diverse types of RGC are spatially arranged. Complementary types of retinal ganglion cell form mosaics with receptive fields that are farther apart than would be expected by chance, supporting the efficient coding of natural scenes."

The objective was to derive and validate a clinical prediction score for SARS-CoV-2 infection that uses simple criteria widely available at the point of care. Methods Data came from the registry data from the national REgistry of suspected COVID-19 in EmeRgency care (RECOVER network) comprising 116 hospitals from 25 states in the US. Clinical variables and 30-day outcomes were abstracted from medical records of 19,850 emergency department (ED) patients tested for SARS-CoV-2. The criterion standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 required a positive molecular test from a swabbed sample or positive antibody testing within 30 days. The prediction score was derived from a 50% random sample (n = 9,925) using unadjusted analysis of 107 candidate variables as a screening step, followed by stepwise forward logistic regression on 72 variables. Results Multivariable regression yielded a 13-variable score, which was simplified to a 13-point score: +1 point each for age&gt;50 years, measured temperature&gt;37.5°C, oxygen saturation&lt;95%, Black race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, household contact with known or suspected COVID-19, patient reported history of dry cough, anosmia/dysgeusia, myalgias or fever; and -1 point each for White race, no direct contact with infected person, or smoking. In the validation sample (n = 9,975), the probability from logistic regression score produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.79–0.81), and this level of accuracy was retained across patients enrolled from the early spring to summer of 2020. In the simplified score, a score of zero produced a sensitivity of 95.6% (94.8–96.3%), specificity of 20.0% (19.0–21.0%), negative likelihood ratio of 0.22 (0.19–0.26). Increasing points on the simplified score predicted higher probability of infection (e.g., &gt;75% probability with +5 or more points). Conclusion Criteria that are available at the point of care can accurately predict the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These criteria could assist with decisions about isolation and testing at high throughput checkpoints."
https://openalex.org/W3134004533,"Background Childhood multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) still affects around 25000 children every year across the globe. Though the treatment success rates for drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) in children are better than adults, children and adolescents face unique hurdles during DR-TB (MDR-TB, Pre-XDR TB and XDR-TB) treatment. This study aimed to understand the patients, guardians and healthcare providers’ perspectives about DR-TB treatment journey of patients and caregivers. Methods This is a qualitative study involving in depth-interviews of purposively selected adolescents (n = 6), patients guardians (for children and adolescents, n = 5) and health care providers (n = 8) of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) clinic, Mumbai, India. In-depth face to face interviews were conducted in English or Hindi language using interview guides during September-November 2019. The interviews were audio-recorded after consent. Thematic network analysis was used to summarize textual data. ATLAS.ti (version 7) was used for analysis. Result The age of adolescent patients ranged from 15–19 years and four were female. Five guardians (of three child and two adolescent patients) and eight healthcare providers (including clinicians- 2, DOT providers-2, counselors-2 and programme managers-2) were interviewed. The overarching theme of the analysis was: Challenging DR-TB treatment journey which consisted of four sub-themes: 1) physical-trauma, 2) emotional-trauma, 3) unavailable social-support and 4) non-adapted healthcare services. Difficulties in compounding of drugs were noted for children while adolescents shared experiences around disruption in social life due to disease and treatment. Most of the patients and caregivers experienced treatment fatigue and burnout during the DR-TB treatment. Participants during interviews gave recommendations to improve care. Discussion The TB programmes must consider the patient and family as one unit when designing the package of care for paediatric DR-TB. Child and adolescent friendly services (paediatric-formulations, age-specific counselling tools and regular interaction with patients and caregivers) will help minimizing burnout in patients and caregivers."
https://openalex.org/W3134691787,"Purpose To evaluate the discrimination of parenchymal lesions between COVID-19 and other atypical pneumonia (AP) by using only radiomics features. Methods In this retrospective study, 301 pneumonic lesions (150 ground-glass opacity [GGO], 52 crazy paving [CP], 99 consolidation) obtained from nonenhanced thorax CT scans of 74 AP (46 male and 28 female; 48.25±13.67 years) and 60 COVID-19 (39 male and 21 female; 48.01±20.38 years) patients were segmented manually by two independent radiologists, and Location, Size, Shape, and First- and Second-order radiomics features were calculated. Results Multiple parameters showed significant differences between AP and COVID-19-related GGOs and consolidations, although only the Range parameter was significantly different for CPs. Models developed by using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for the whole group of GGO and consolidation lesions predicted COVID-19 consolidation and AP GGO lesions with low accuracy (46.1% and 60.8%, respectively). Thus, instead of subjective classification, lesions were reclassified according to their skewness into positive skewness group (PSG, 78 AP and 71 COVID-19 lesions) and negative skewness group (NSG, 56 AP and 44 COVID-19 lesions), and group-specific models were created. The best AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were respectively 0.774, 75.8%, 74.6%, and 76.9% among the PSG models and 0.907, 83%, 79.5%, and 85.7% for the NSG models. The best PSG model was also better at predicting NSG lesions smaller than 3 mL. Using an algorithm, 80% of COVID-19 and 81.1% of AP patients were correctly predicted. Conclusion During periods of increasing AP, radiomics parameters may provide valuable data for the differential diagnosis of COVID-19."

https://openalex.org/W3135452675,"Abstract HER3 is highly expressed in luminal breast cancer subtypes. Its activation by NRG1 promotes activation of AKT and ERK1/2, contributing to tumour progression and therapy resistance. HER3-targeting agents that block this activation, are currently under phase 1/2 clinical studies, and although they have shown favorable tolerability, their activity as a single agent has proven to be limited. Here we show that phosphorylation and activation of HER3 in luminal breast cancer cells occurs in a paracrine manner and is mediated by NRG1 expressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Moreover, we uncover a HER3-independent NRG1 signaling in CAFs that results in the induction of a strong migratory and pro-fibrotic phenotype, describing a subtype of CAFs with elevated expression of NRG1 and an associated transcriptomic profile that determines their functional properties. Finally, we identified Hyaluronan Synthase 2 (HAS2) , a targetable molecule strongly correlated with NRG1 , as an attractive player supporting NRG1 signaling in CAFs."
https://openalex.org/W3084336495,"Introduction Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease, which caused by a novel coronavirus. The disease disrupts health systems and resulting in social, political, and economic crises. Health professionals are in front of this pandemic and always work in a high-risk environment. The best prevention for COVID-19 is avoiding exposure to the virus. Some studies reported health professional’s practice of precautionary measures for COVID-19. Nevertheless, a few have identified factors affecting. As such, this study aimed to fill those research gaps in the study setting. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 428 health professionals involved from the public health facilities of the Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia. A simple random sampling method employed, and the data collected by the interviewer-administered Open Data Kit survey tool and observational checklist. The data analyzed in Stata version 15, and a binary logistic regression model used to identify factors. In this study, a statistically significant association declared at P&lt; 0.05. Results In this study, 35.3% (95%CI: 30.7%, 39.8%) of health professionals’ had a good practice on precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Use hand sanitizer or wash hands continuously with soap and water (68.9%), cover nose and mouth with a tissue during sneezing or coughing (67.3%), and use facemask in crowds (56.8%) were the most common practice reported by study participants. Marital status, being married (AOR = 1.84, 95%CI: 1.06, 3.18), good knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR = 2.02, 95%CI: 1.02, 3.18), and positive attitude towards precautionary measures for the COVID-19 were factors showed significant association with the practice. Conclusions The magnitude of good practice of precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic among health professionals was low. As such, different interventions to improve the knowledge and attitude of health professionals in the health care system are highly needed to boost the practice and to advance service delivery."
https://openalex.org/W3133581524,"Rationale Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Studies have primarily assessed the relationship between smoking on COPD risk focusing on summary measures, like smoking status. Objective Develop a COPD risk prediction model incorporating individual time-varying smoking exposures. Methods The Nurses’ Health Study (N = 86,711) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (N = 39,817) data was used to develop a COPD risk prediction model. Data was randomly split in 50–50 samples for model building and validation. Cox regression with time-varying covariates was used to assess the association between smoking duration, intensity and year-since-quit and self-reported COPD diagnosis incidence. We evaluated the model calibration as well as discriminatory accuracy via the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC). We computed 6-year risk of COPD incidence given various individual smoking scenarios. Results Smoking duration, year-since-quit (if former smokers), sex, and interaction of sex and smoking duration are significantly associated with the incidence of diagnosed COPD. The model that incorporated time-varying smoking variables yielded higher AUCs compared to models using only pack-years. The AUCs for the model were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.74–0.86) and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.70–0.77) for males and females, respectively. Conclusions Utilizing detailed smoking pattern information, the model predicts COPD risk with better accuracy than models based on only smoking summary measures. It might serve as a tool for early detection programs by identifying individuals at high-risk for COPD."

In total, 10,704 patients had CULA, including 6,174 boys (57.7%) and 4,530 girls (42.3%). The mean annual incidence of CULA was 23.5 per 10,000 live births; it was significantly higher in boys than in girls (26.3 vs. 20.5, p < 0.001). Among the four categories of CULA-polydactyly, syndactyly, limb deficiency, and other anomalies-polydactyly was the most common. In total, 4,149 patients (38.8%) had other congenital anomalies and coexisting anomalies of the circulatory system (24.9%) were the most common. In total 4,776 patients (44.6%) underwent operative treatment for CULA within minimum three years of the diagnosis. The proportion of patients who underwent surgical treatment was significantly higher for polydactyly (73.4% vs. 16.8%, p < 0.001) and syndactyly (65.3% vs. 41.5%, p < 0.001), but it was significantly lower in limb deficiency (27.6% vs. 45.4%, p < 0.001) and other anomalies (10.0% vs. 69.8%, p < 0.001) than rest of CULA patients. Among the patients who had operations, 21.5% underwent multiple operations. The proportion of patients who underwent multiple operations was significantly higher in syndactyly (35.6% vs. 18.1%, p < 0.001), but it was significantly lower in polydactyly (4.0% vs. 95.5%, p < 0.001) and other anomalies (17.9% vs. 21.9%, p < 0.001) than rest of CULA patients. These results could provide a basis for estimating the national healthcare costs for CULA and the required number of CULA specialists."
https://openalex.org/W3133743162,"Early infant diagnosis (EID) and treatment can prevent much of the HIV-related morbidity and mortality experienced by children but is challenging to implement in sub-Saharan Africa. Point-of-care (PoC) testing would decentralize testing and increase access to rapid diagnosis. The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of PoC testing in Southern Province, Zambia.A decision tree model was developed to compare health outcomes and costs between the standard of care (SoC) and PoC testing using GeneXpert and m-PIMA platforms. The primary health outcome was antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation within 60 days of sample collection. Additional outcomes included ART initiation by 12 months of age and death prior to ART initiation. Costs included both capital and recurrent costs. Health outcomes and costs were combined to create incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs).The proportion of children initiating ART within 60 days increased from 27.8% with SoC to 79.8-82.8% with PoC testing depending on the algorithm and platform. The proportion of children initiating ART by 12 months of age increased from 50.9% with SoC to 84.0-86.5% with PoC testing. The proportion of HIV-infected children dying prior to ART initiation decreased from 18.1% with SoC to 3.8-4.6% with PoC testing. Total program costs were similar for the SoC and GeneXpert but higher for m-PIMA. ICERs for PoC testing were favorable, ranging from $23-1,609 for ART initiation within 60 days, $37-2,491 for ART initiation by 12 months of age, and $90-6,188 for deaths prior to ART initiation. Factors impacting the costs of PoC testing, including the lifespan of the testing instruments and integrated utilization of PoC platforms, had the biggest impact on the ICERs. Integrating utilization across programs decreased costs for the EID program, such that PoC testing was cost-saving in some situations.PoC testing has the potential to improve linkage to care and ART initiation for HIV-infected infants and should be considered for implementation within EID programs to achieve equity in access to HIV services and reduce HIV-related pediatric morbidity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3135654416,"The incidence of endometrial cancer (EC) has increased over the past years and mainly affects women above the age of 45 years. Metabolic diseases such as obesity and type II diabetes mellitus as well as associated conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia lead to elevated levels of circulating estrogens. Increased estrogen concentrations, in turn, further trigger the proliferation of endometrial cells and thus promote EC development and progression, especially in the absence of progesterone as seen in postmenopausal women. Elevated blood glucose levels in diabetic patients further contribute to the risk of EC development. Metformin is an insulin-sensitizing biguanide drug, commonly used in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus, especially in obese patients. Besides its effects on glucose metabolism, metformin displayed anti-cancer effects in various cancer types, including EC. Direct anti-cancer effects of metformin target signaling pathways that are involved in cellular growth and proliferation, e.g. the AKT/PKB/mTOR pathway. Further proteins and pathways have been suggested as potential targets, but the underlying mechanism of action of metformin’s anti-cancer activity is still not completely understood. In the present study, the effects of metformin on protein expression were investigated in the human EC cell line HEC-1A using an affinity proteomic approach. Cells were treated with 0.5 mmol/L metformin over a period of 7 days and changes in the expression pattern of 1,300 different proteins were compared to the expression in untreated control cells as well as insulin-treated cells. Insulin treatment (100 ng/mL) was incorporated into the study in order to implement a model for insulin resistance and associated hyperinsulinemia, conditions that are often observed in obese and diabetic patients. Furthermore, the culture medium was supplemented with 10 nmol/L ß-estradiol (E2) during treatments to mimic increased estrogen levels, a common risk factor for EC development. Based on the most prominent and significant changes in expression, a set of 80 proteins was selected and subjected to a more detailed analysis. The data revealed that metformin and insulin targeted similar pathways in the present study and mostly acted on proteins related to proliferation, migration and tumor immune response. These pathways may be affected in a tumor-promoting as well as a tumor-suppressing way by either metformin treatment or insulin supplementation. The consequences for the cells resulting from the detected expression changes were discussed in detail for several proteins. The presented data helps identify potential targets affected by metformin treatment in EC and allows for a better understanding of the mechanism of action of the biguanide drug’s anti-cancer activity. However, further investigations are necessary to confirm the observations and conclusions drawn from the presented data after metformin administration, especially for proteins that were regulated in a favorable way, i.e. AKT3, CCND2, CD63, CD81, GFAP, IL5, IL17A, IRF4, PI3, and VTCN1. Further proteins might be of interest, where metformin counteracted unfavorable effects that have been induced by hyperinsulinemia."
https://openalex.org/W3134252933,"Ultrasound imaging has developed into an indispensable imaging technology in medical diagnosis and treatment applications due to its unique advantages, such as safety, affordability, and convenience. With the development of data information acquisition technology, ultrasound imaging is increasingly susceptible to speckle noise, which leads to defects, such as low resolution, poor contrast, spots, and shadows, which affect the accuracy of physician analysis and diagnosis. To solve this problem, we proposed a frequency division denoising algorithm combining transform domain and spatial domain. First, the ultrasound image was decomposed into a series of sub-modal images using 2D variational mode decomposition (2D-VMD), and adaptively determined 2D-VMD parameter K value based on visual information fidelity (VIF) criterion. Then, an anisotropic diffusion filter was used to denoise low-frequency sub-modal images, and a 3D block matching algorithm (BM3D) was used to reduce noise for high-frequency images with high noise. Finally, each sub-modal image was reconstructed after processing to obtain the denoised ultrasound image. In the comparative experiments of synthetic, simulation, and real images, the performance of this method was quantitatively evaluated. Various results show that the ability of this algorithm in denoising and maintaining structural details is significantly better than that of other algorithms."

https://openalex.org/W3135510918,"Background The extent of myocardial fibrosis in patients with severe aortic stenosis might have an important prognostic value. Non-invasive imaging to quantify myocardial fibrosis by measuring extracellular volume fraction might have an important clinical utility prior to aortic valve intervention. Methods Seventy-five consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis, and 19 normal subjects were prospectively recruited and underwent pre- and post-contrast computed tomography for estimating myocardial extracellular volume fraction. Serum level of galectin-3 was measured and 2-dimensional echocardiography was performed to characterize the extent of cardiac damage using a recently published aortic stenosis staging classification. Results Extracellular volume fraction was higher in patients with aortic stenosis compared to normal subjects (40.0±11% vs. 21.6±5.6%; respectively, p&lt;0.001). In patients with aortic stenosis, extracellular volume fraction correlated with markers of left ventricular decompensation including New York Heart Association functional class, left atrial volume, staging classification of aortic stenosis and lower left ventricular ejection fraction. Out of 75 patients in the AS group, 49 underwent TAVI, 6 surgical AVR, 2 balloon valvuloplasty, and 18 did not undergo any type of intervention. At 12-months after aortic valve intervention, extracellular volume fraction predicted the combined outcomes of stroke and hospitalization for heart failure with an area under the curve of 0.77 (95% confidence interval: 0.65–0.88). A trend for correlation between serum galectin-3 and extracellular volume was noted. Conclusion In patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing computed tomography before aortic valve intervention, quantification of extracellular volume fraction correlated with functional status and markers of left ventricular decompensation, and predicted the 12-months composite adverse clinical outcomes. Implementation of this novel technique might aid in the risk stratification process before aortic valve interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3134704996,"Aims To describe how patients respond to early signs of foot problems and the factors that result in delays in care. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a large sample of Veterans from across the United States with diabetes mellitus who had undergone a toe amputation. Data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results We interviewed 61 male patients. Mean age was 66 years, 41% were married, and 37% had a high school education or less. The patient-level factors related to delayed care included: 1) not knowing something was wrong, 2) misinterpreting symptoms, 3) “sudden” and “unexpected” illness progression, and 4) competing priorities getting in the way of care-seeking. The system-level factors included: 5) asking patients to watch it, 6) difficulty getting the right type of care when needed, and 7) distance to care and other transportation barriers. Conclusion A confluence of patient factors (e.g., not examining their feet regularly or thoroughly and/or not acting quickly when they noticed something was wrong) and system factors (e.g., absence of a mechanism to support patient’s appraisal of symptoms, lack of access to timely and convenient-located appointments) delayed care. Identifying patient- and system-level interventions that can shorten or eliminate care delays could help reduce rates of limb loss."
https://openalex.org/W3134953320,"There has been very limited use of computer assisted semen analysis (CASA) to evaluate reptile sperm. The aim of this study was to examine sperm kinematic variables in American crocodile ( Crocodylus acutus ) semen samples and to assess whether sperm subpopulations could be characterized. Eight ejaculates (two ejaculates/male) from four sexually mature captive crocodiles were obtained. An ISAS®v1 CASA-Mot system, with an image acquisition rate of 50 Hz, and ISAS®D4C20 counting chambers were used for sperm analyses. The percentages of motile and progressively motile spermatozoa did not differ among animals (P &gt; 0.05) but there was a significant animal effect with regards to kinematic variables (P &lt; 0.05). Principal component (PC) analysis revealed that kinematic variables grouped into three components: PC1, related to velocity; PC2 to progressiveness and PC3 to oscillation. Subpopulation structure analysis identified four groups (P &lt; 0.05), which represented, on average, 9.8%, 32.1%, 26.8%, and 31.3% of the total sperm population. Males differed in the proportion of sperm in each of the kinematic subpopulations. This new approach for the analysis of reptile sperm kinematic subpopulations, reflecting quantifiable parameters generated by CASA system technology, opens up possibilities for future assessments of crocodile sperm and will be useful in the future development of assisted reproduction for these species."
https://openalex.org/W3135102624,"There are professional expectations for public health nurses to develop competencies in evidence-informed decision-making (EIDM) due to its potential for improved client outcomes. Robust tools to assess EIDM competence can encourage increased EIDM engagement and uptake. This study aimed to develop and validate the content of a measure to assess EIDM competence among public health nurses. A four-stage process, based on measure development principles and the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing, was used to develop and refine items for a new EIDM competence measure: a) content coverage assessment of existing measures; b) identification of existing measures for use and development of items; c) validity assessment based on content; d) validity assessment based on response process. An EIDM competence measurement tool consisting of EIDM knowledge, skills, attitudes/beliefs, and behaviour items was developed using conceptual literature and existing measures (Evidence-Based Practice Competency Tool and Evidence-Based Practice Beliefs Scale) to address limitations of existing EIDM tools identified from the content coverage assessment. Item content validity index ratings ranged from 0.64–1.00. Qualitative themes from validity assessment based on content and response process included word changes to improve clarity, reducing item redundancy, separating multi-component items, and ensuring items reflect nursing role expectations. Upon determining its reliability and validity, there is potential for the EIDM competence measure to be used in: public health nursing practice to identify competence gaps and strengths to facilitate professional development activities; in research to support development of strategies to build EIDM capacity; and for curriculum planning and development across nursing education programs."
https://openalex.org/W3135903464,"Quinoa depicts high nutritional quality and abiotic stress resistance, attracting strong interest in the last years. To unravel the function of candidate genes for agronomically relevant traits, studying their transcriptional activities by RT-qPCR is an important experimental approach. The accuracy of such experiments strongly depends on precise data normalization. To date, validation of potential candidate genes for normalization of diurnal expression studies has not been performed in C . quinoa . We selected eight candidate genes based on transcriptome data and literature survey, including conventionally used reference genes. We used three statistical algorithms (BestKeeper, geNorm and NormFinder) to test their stability and added further validation by a simulation-based strategy. We demonstrated that using different reference genes, including those top ranked by stability, causes significant differences among the resulting diurnal expression patterns. Our results show that isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme ( IDH-A ) and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein ( PTB ) are suitable genes to normalize diurnal expression data of two different quinoa accessions. Moreover, we validated our reference genes by normalizing two known diurnally regulated genes, BTC1 and BBX19 . The validated reference genes obtained in this study will improve the accuracy of RT-qPCR data normalization and facilitate gene expression studies in quinoa."

https://openalex.org/W3134350315,"Increased access to reliable medical oxygen would reduce the global burden of pneumonia. Oxygen concentrators have been shown to be an effective solution, however they have significant drawbacks when used in low-resource environments where pneumonia burden is the heaviest. Low quality grid power can damage oxygen concentrators and blackouts can prevent at-risk patients from receiving continual oxygen therapy. Gaps in prescribed oxygen flow can result in acquired brain injuries, extended hypoxemia and death. The FREO2 Low-Pressure Oxygen Storage (LPOS) system consists of a suite of improvements to a standard oxygen concentrator which address these limitations. This study reports the technical results of a field trial of the system in Mbarara, Uganda. During this trial, oxygen supplied from the LPOS system was distributed to four beds in the paediatric ward of Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital. Over a three-month period, medical-grade oxygen was made available to patients 100% of the time. This period was sufficient to quantify the ability of the LPOS system to deal with blackouts, maintenance, and an unscheduled repair to the LPOS store."
https://openalex.org/W3133645222,"The purposes are to evaluate the Distributed Clustering Algorithm (DCA) applicability in the power system's big data processing and find the information economic dispatch strategy suitable for new energy consumption in power systems. A two-layer DCA algorithm is proposed based on K-Means Clustering (KMC) and Affinity Propagation (AP) clustering algorithms. Then the incentive Demand Response (DR) is introduced, and the DR flexibility of the user side is analyzed. Finally, the day-ahead dispatch and real-time dispatch schemes are combined, and a multi-period information economic dispatch model is constructed. The algorithm performance is analyzed according to case analyses of new energy consumption. Results demonstrate that the two-layer DCA's calculation time is 5.23s only, the number of iterations is small, and the classification accuracy rate reaches 0.991. Case 2 corresponding to the proposed model can consume the new energy, and the income of the aggregator can be maximized. In short, the multi-period information economic dispatch model can consume the new energy and meet the DR of the user side."
https://openalex.org/W3133769824,"Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a regional anesthetic technique used to desensitize the abdominal wall in several species. This study aimed to describe the anatomical characteristics of the abdominal wall and to identify a feasible approach for an US-guided TAP injection that would result in adequate staining of the relevant nerves in the abdominal wall in pig cadavers. Fresh cadavers from five Landrace pigs (age, 12 weeks; body weight, 35.5 ± 1.6 kg) were used. One pig (n = 1) was anatomically dissected, and four pigs (n = 4; i.e., 8 hemiabdomens) were used for TAP injections and evaluation of dye spread. The volume of 0.3 mL/kg/injection point of methylene blue was injected bilaterally. In the caudal retrocostal approach, the injection was performed ventral to the most caudal part of the costal arch. In the lateral approach, the injection was performed between the last rib and iliac crest. A needle was inserted in plane for the caudal retrocostal and the lateral approach caudocranially and craniocaudally, respectively. Successful staining was defined as presence of dye on the nerve for a length of &gt;1 cm in its entire circumference. The TAP was found between different muscle layers in the described anatomical regions. In the caudal retrocostal approach the TAP was found between the external abdominal oblique and transversus abdominis muscle bellies. In the lateral approach the TAP was found between the internal abdominal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles. The approach combining lateral and caudal retrocostal injections at the studied volume stained a median of 5 (3–6) target nerves from the fourth-last thoracic nerve to L2 (six nerves). Combined caudal retrocostal and lateral TAP injections of 0.3 mL/kg/injection point, resulted in staining of target nerve branches which supply the periumbilical and caudal abdominal wall in pig cadavers."
https://openalex.org/W3133966320,"A non-neoplastic epithelium (NE) often appears in gastric cancer (GC). We explored the histological features of NE in comparison between HP-eradicated and HP-infected GCs. We enrolled 40 HP-eradicated and 40 HP-infected GCs matched by size, macroscopic and histological type. NE was classified into full gland type and surface type; the former was a non-neoplastic gland isolated within cancer, and the latter was NE on the surface of the cancer. Surface type was additionally divided into NE at the cancer margin (marginal surface type) and NE inside cancer (internal surface type). The primary endpoints were the frequency and the length ratio (the ratio to cancer length) of NE. The secondary endpoints were the relationships between NE and clinicopathological factors, including endoscopic findings of a gastritis-like appearance (GLA), reddish depressed lesion (RDL), and white nodular mucosa (WNM). The frequency and length ratio of the internal surface type in HP-eradicated GCs were significantly higher (82.5% vs 50%, P = 0.005) and larger (11.6 ± 10.6 vs 4.2 ± 9.9, P &lt; 0.001) than those in HP-infected GCs, and the increase was more significant according to the passage of time since HP eradication. The frequency and length ratio of marginal surface type and full gland type were not significantly different between the two groups, but the coexistence of internal surface and full gland types was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). The frequencies of GLA, RDLs, and WNM in HP-eradicated GCs were significantly higher than those in HP-infected GCs. GLA-positive GCs were covered more widely by internal surface type than GLA-negative GCs (13.3% vs. 6.6%, P = 0.003). Various types of NE were noted in gastric cancer, and the internal surface type of NE was shown to be significantly linked to HP-eradicated cancer and GLA."
https://openalex.org/W3134934304,"We developed and examined the construct validity of the Disgust Avoidance Questionnaire (DAQ) as a measure of people’s inclination to prevent experiencing disgust (disgust prevention) and to escape from the experience of disgust (disgust escape). In a stepwise item-reduction (Study 1; N = 417) using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) based on a 4-subscale distinction (behavioral prevention, cognitive prevention, behavioral escape, cognitive escape), we selected 17 items from a pool of potential items. In order to incorporate the conceptual overlap between dimensions of disgust avoidance, focus (prevention vs. escape), and strategy (behavioral avoidance vs. cognitive avoidance), we specified an adapted model. In this model, we allowed each item to load on one type of dimension and one type of strategy, resulting in four overlapping factors (prevention, escape, behavioral avoidance, cognitive avoidance). Evaluation of this overlapping 4-factor model (Study 2; N = 513) using Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) showed promising model fit indices, factor loadings, factor correlations, and reliability estimates for three of the four factors (prevention, behavioral avoidance, cognitive avoidance). Those three subscales also showed good convergent validity. In contrast, the results related to the escape factor may call the suitability of self-report to assess disgust escape into question. In light of the exploratory nature of the project, future examinations of the DAQ’s validity and applicability to more diverse samples are essential. A critical next step for future research would be to examine the DAQ’s criterion validity and the distinctive roles of the DAQ subscales in (clinical) psychological constructs and processes."
https://openalex.org/W3135428754,"With the development of the economy and technology, people’s requirement for communication is also increasing. Satellite communication networks have been paid more and more attention because of their broadband service capability and wide coverage. In this paper, we investigate the scheme of convolutional long short term memory (CLSTM) network and transfer learning (TL) based combined free/demand assignment multiple access (CFDAMA) scheme (CFDAMA-CLSTMTL), which is a new multiple access scheme in the satellite communication networks. Generally, there is a delay time T between sending a request from the user to the satellite and receiving a reply from the satellite. So far, the traditional multiple access schemes have not processed the data generated in this period. So, in order to transmit the data in time, we propose a new prediction method CLSTMTL, which can be used to predict the data generated in this period. We introduce the prediction method into the CFDAMA scheme so that it can reduce data accumulation by the way of sending the slots request which is the sum of slots requested by the user and the predicted slots generated in the delay time. A comparison with CFDAMA-PA and CFDAMA-PB is provided through simulation results, which gives the effect of the CFDAMA-CLSTMTL in a satellite communication network."

https://openalex.org/W3134085739,"Physical attractiveness has been shown to reflect women’s current fecundity level, allowing a man to choose a potentially more fertile partner in mate choice context. However, women vary not only in terms of fecundity level at reproductive age but also in reproductive longevity, both influencing a couple’s long-term reproductive success. Thus, men should choose their potential partner not only based on cues of current fecundity but also on cues of reproductive longevity, and both may be reflected in women’s appearance. In this study, we investigated if a woman’s facial attractiveness at reproductive age reflects anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) level, a hormone predictor of age at menopause, similarly as it reflects current fecundity level, estimated with estradiol level (E2). Face photographs of 183 healthy women (M age = 28.49, SD age = 2.38), recruited between 2 nd - 4 th day of the menstrual cycle, were assessed by men in terms of attractiveness. Women’s health status was evaluated based on C-reactive protein level and biochemical blood test. Serum AMH and E2 were measured. The results showed that facial attractiveness was negatively correlated with AMH level, a hormone indicator of expected age at menopause, and positively with E2, indicator of current fecundity level, also when controlled for potential covariates (testosterone, BMI, age). This might result from biological trade-off between high fecundity and the length of reproductive lifespan in women and greater adaptive importance of high fecundity at reproductive age compared to the length of reproductive lifespan."

Pregnant mice were divided into four groups, each consisting of 10 dams, and received drink and food ad libitum . The first group was administered LE3H (E1), the second one HgCl 2 (E2), the third one HgCl 2 +LE3H (E3), and the fourth was control (E0), administered double-distilled water only. HgCl 2 (5 mg/kg bw) was administrated by injection intraperitoneally on gestation day (GD)9 and LE3H (0.39 mg/g bw) was administered by gavage on GD10. The treated and control animals were killed by cervical dislocation on GD18, dissected, and the morphologically normal living fetuses (MNLF) were collected. The MNLF of E0, E1, E2, and E3 from 5 dams were fixed with Bouin solution, and observed using the free hand razor blade technique for soft tissue examination. The remaining MNLF were fixed with 96% ethanol, and then stained with Alizarin Red S and Alcian Blue for ossification examination. Index of length of ossified part (ILOP) of humerus, index of width of ossified part (IWOP) of humerus, ILOP of femur, and IWOP of femur were calculated. E2 had higher cases of anatomical defects (74,6%) than E3 (48.9%), E1 (15.0%), and E0 (0%). E2 had humerus IWOP of 0.82±0.03, which was significantly lower than that of E0 (0.89±0.04) and E1 (0.89±0.03), while that of E1 and E0 was not significantly different from each other. Meanwhile, IWOP in E3 (0.88±0.03) was significantly higher than that in E2, but not different from that in E1 and E0. Thus, LE3H mitigated defects in fetal anatomy and endochondral ossification induced by HgCl 2 in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3135571789,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the primary cause of viral bronchiolitis resulting in hospitalization and a frequent cause of secondary respiratory bacterial infection, especially by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) in infants. While murine studies have demonstrated enhanced morbidity during a viral/bacterial co-infection, human meta-studies have conflicting results. Moreover, little knowledge about the pathogenesis of emerging Spn serotype 22F, especially the co-pathologies between RSV and Spn , is known. Here, colostrum-deprived neonate lambs were divided into four groups. Two of the groups were nebulized with RSV M37, and the other two groups were mock nebulized. At day three post-RSV infection, one RSV group (RSV /Spn) and one mock-nebulized group ( Spn only ) were inoculated with Spn intratracheally. At day six post-RSV infection, bacterial/viral loads were assessed along with histopathology and correlated with clinical symptoms. Lambs dually infected with RSV/ Spn trended with higher RSV titers, but lower Spn . Additionally, lung lesions were observed to be more frequent in the RSV/ Spn group characterized by increased interalveolar wall thickness accompanied by neutrophil and lymphocyte infiltration and higher myeloperoxidase. Despite lower Spn in lungs, co-infected lambs had more significant morbidity and histopathology, which correlated with a different cytokine response. Thus, enhanced disease severity during dual infection may be due to lesion development and altered immune responses rather than bacterial counts."
