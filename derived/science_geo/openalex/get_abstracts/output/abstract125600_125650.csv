https://openalex.org/W2159006998,"Working memory is responsible for the short-term storage and online manipulation of information necessary for higher cognitive functions, such as language, planning and problem-solving. Traditionally, working memory has been divided into two types of processes: executive control (governing the encoding manipulation and retrieval of information in working memory) and active maintenance (keeping information available 'online'). It has also been proposed that these two types of processes may be subserved by distinct cortical structures, with the prefrontal cortex housing the executive control processes, and more posterior regions housing the content-specific buffers (for example verbal versus visuospatial) responsible for active maintenance. However, studies in non-human primates suggest that dorsolateral regions of the prefrontal cortex may also be involved in active maintenance. We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain activation in human subjects during performance of a working memory task. We used the temporal resolution of this technique to examine the dynamics of regional activation, and to show that prefrontal cortex along with parietal cortex appears to play a role in active maintenance."

The embryonic expression pattern of the mouse Brca2 gene is now defined and an interaction identified of the Brca2 protein with the DMA-repair protein Rad51. Developmental arrest in Brca2-deficient embryos, their radiation sensitivity, and the association of Brca2 with Rad51 indicate that Brca2 may be an essential cofactor in the Rad51-dependent DNA repair of double-strand breaks, thereby explaining the tumour-suppressor function of Brca2."

https://openalex.org/W2119773879,"The use of genetic information in the workplace poses societal risks that have an impact on employment possibilities, health insurance, and privacy. Individuals who might otherwise believe they can benefit from genetic testing may decline it because of their fear of employment discrimination and lack of privacy in the workplace. As a consequence, the future of research on the benefits and risks of predictive genetic testing may also be compromised. Thus, policy-makers need to evaluate legislative and regulatory strategies to address these concerns. This paper analyzes state and federal legislative approaches to genetic information in the workplace and concludes with a discussion of policy considerations and recommendation."

https://openalex.org/W2334501537,"Prostate cancer, like other types of cancer, is associated with the loss of cell cycle control, resulting in unregulated growth of cells. We report here on the inhibitory effects of interferon α (IFNα) on the cell cycle of prostate cancer cells, using the human prostate carcinoma cell line DU145 that has mutations in the tumor suppressor genes pRB, p53 and KAI1. IFNα inhibited growth and colony formation of DU145 cells and analysis by flow cytometry suggests that IFNα inhibited the progression of these cancer cells from the G1 through S phase of the cell cycle. IFNα treatment of DU145 cells reduced cyclin dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) activity. In particular, cyclin E dependent cdk2 activity was inhibited by IFNα treatment. IFNα treatment, however, did not affect the amount of cdk2 bound to cyclin E. Consistent with this data, IFNα was able to induce expression of the kinase inhibitor p21 in DU145 cells. Furthermore, IFN treatment increased the amounts of p21 complexed with cdk2 in these cells. These data support a role for p21 in mediating the antiproliferative action of IFNα. The induction of p21 and its growth inhibitory effects in DU145 cells appears independent of p53, pRB and KAI1 status."
https://openalex.org/W1977920690,"DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), a candidate tumor suppressor gene located in chromosome band 18q21.2, encodes a transmembrane protein of 1447 amino acids. Neogenin, a protein with nearly 50% amino acid identity to DCC, was recently identified because of its dynamic expression in the developing nervous system and gastrointestinal tract of the chicken. To explore a role for the human neogenin (NGN) gene in cancer, we have isolated cDNAs for two alternatively spliced forms of NGN, encoding proteins of 1461 and 1408 amino acids. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies (FISH) localized NGN in chromosome band 15q22, a region infrequently affected by alterations in cancer. NGN transcripts of about 7.5 and 5.5 kb were detected in all adult tissues studied. In contrast to the frequent loss of DCC expression, no alterations in NGN expression were observed in more than 50 cancers studied, including glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, colorectal, breast, cervical and pancreatic cancer cell lines and xenografts. Based on their sequence conservation and similar expression during development, DCC and NGN may have related functions. However, the chromosomal location and ubiquitous expression of NGN in various human tumors suggest it is infrequently altered in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2318082749,"To understand the effects of ionizing radiation on thyroid cells, we investigated the role of p53 in mediating apoptosis and in DNA repair following in vivo and in vitro irradiation of thyroid cells. In vitro exposure of human thyroid cells to ionizing radiation of up to 5 – 8 Gy failed to induce apoptosis in primary cells. The same results were obtained when the thyroid gland was irradiated in the intact rat. To explore the mechanism of failure of the wild-type p53 in inducing apoptosis in thyroid cells, we investigated the expression of apoptosis-related genes, bax, bcl-2 and fas/APO-1 following irradiation or induction of temperature-sensitive p53. The expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and Fas/APO-1 in human primary cultured thyroid cells did not change after irradiation. To further confirm the results, we established a clonal cell line (tsFRO) in which a temperature sensitive p53 (Val138) expression vector was stably transfected to a thyroid carcinoma cell line lacking endogenous p53. Incubation of tsFRO cells at the permissive temperature for three days, however, did not induce apoptosis although G1 arrest was noted. Although enhanced expression of the bax mRNA level was observed, the expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and Fas/APO-1 protein did not change by shifting tsFRO cells to permissive temperature as well as irradiated primary cells. Furthermore, DNA end-jointing ability was examined by transfection of linearized luciferase plasmid into tsFRO cells. Increased luciferase activity occurred when the cells were cultured at the permissive temperature, indicating that the wild-type p53 enhances DNA end-jointing activity. Our results indicate that the wild-type p53 does not lead to apoptosis but facilitates DNA end-jointing in thyroid cells. These results may reflect specific responses in thyroid cells following irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2330414324,"Dephosphorylation of the RB protein has been reported to be associated with apoptosis. In contrast, we show that treatment of HL60 cells with etoposide or cytosine arabinoside or treatment of breast epithelial cells with alpha-FAS is associated with the cleavage of a 5 kDa fragment from the C-terminus of RB, resulting in a truncated product that we have designated as p100cl. This cleavage event coincides with the activation of cysteine proteases at the onset of apoptosis, is blocked by the addition of iodoacetamide to cells prior to the onset of apoptosis, and results in the expression of faster migrating protein species which can mimic dephosphorylated RB. The free 5 kDa fragment is detected only during apoptosis, predicts a cleavage site that we have mapped to a unique CPP32-like recognition sequence which is present at the C-terminus of all reported RB homologues, and results in a truncated RB protein with enhanced E2F binding affinity. While the causality for this cleavage event in the apoptotic process is still under investigation, our findings suggest distinct post-translational pathways for the RB product between cells examined during growth arrest (p105 hypophosphorylated RB) or apoptosis (p100cl)."

https://openalex.org/W2048660424,"The E2F family of transcription factors play a key role in G1-S progression. A dominant negative mutant (E2F97) of E2F1 containing the DNA binding domain of E2F1 under the control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter was constructed. Stable transfectants were produced in the pRb-lacking SaOS-2 cell line and SV40-transformed VA-13 cell line, respectively. Induction of E2F97 by tetracycline withdrawal resulted in strong inhibition of the E2F transcriptional activity and a decreased percentage of cells in S-phase. To understand the mechanism(s) by which E2F97 exerts its effect on the cell cycle, the effect of E2F97 on expression of various cell cycle proteins was examined. Upon induction of E2F97, a significant decrease in the levels of both dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase was observed in transfectants derived from both cell lines. Induction of E2F97 also led to a decrease in cyclin A and D1 protein levels. Regulation of cyclin A by E2F97 occurred at the transcriptional level. In addition, in VA13 cells, induction of E2F97 resulted in down-regulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. These data suggest that E2F regulates both G1 and S-phase cyclins and that there may be a potential positive feedback regulatory loop between E2F and cyclin D1."
https://openalex.org/W2331632917,"Polycythemia vera (PV) is an acquired clonal disorder characterized by increased production of mature red cells and growth of erythroid colonies in the absence of erythropoietin. Mutation of the erythropoietin receptor has been demonstrated to cause familial polycythemia, but no mutations have been found in PV. Moreover, both erythroid and myeloid progenitors from patients with PV have been reported to be hypersensitive to a number of different growth factors. Attention has therefore focused on post-receptor signal transduction pathways. The SHP-1 gene is an especially attractive candidate gene. Firstly, SHP-1 binds to and negatively regulates signalling from the erythropoietin receptor and is likely to regulate other cytokine receptors in a similar manner. Secondly, absence of SHP-1 protein in the motheaten mouse is accompanied by increased sensitivity of hematopoietic progenitors to a number of cytokines including erythropoietin. Thirdly, familial or sporadic polycythemia in man may result from mutations of the SHP-1 binding domain of the erythropoietin receptor. We have therefore searched for mutations of the SHP-1 gene in genomic DNA from patients with PV. In this disease the majority of peripheral blood lymphocytes are not part of the malignant clone and a variable proportion of myeloid cells may arise from normal progenitors. We have therefore chosen to study DNA from purified peripheral blood granulocytes obtained from nine women in whom the granulocytes were clonally derived. Southern analysis was used to show that the gene was not rearranged and densitometry confirmed the presence of two copies of the gene in each DNA sample. Sequencing of the entire coding region and all splice junctions revealed no mutations. Hematopoietic transcription factor binding sites in the SHP-1 promoter region were intact and the methylation status of the two SHP-1 promoters in PV patients was identical to that in three normal controls. Finally, we showed that levels of SHP-1 protein in granulocytes from patients was similar to those from normal controls. These results demonstrate that the SHP-1 gene is structurally and transcriptionally intact in patients with PV."

https://openalex.org/W2327096122,"Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD and the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and pRb2/p130. Downstream effectors of 'pocket' proteins are the components of the E2F family of transcription factors, which regulate the G1/S-phase transition. We analysed by EMSA the composition of E2F complexes in cycling, quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. An E2F complex containing mainly E2F4 and pRb2/p130 (E2F-G0/G1 complex) appears when DNA synthesis arrests, replacing the cyclinA/cdk2 containing E2F complex of proliferating myoblasts (E2F-G1/S complex). Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re-appearance of E2F-G1/S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. In differentiating C2C12 cells, E2F complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when MyoD DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor MyoD downstream effector p21 are induced. Thus, during myogenic differentiation, formation of E2F4 and pRb2/p130 containing complexes is an early event, but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis. Using a subclone of C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing Estrogen Receptor-MyoD (ER-MyoD) chimerae, we found that estrogen directed MyoD activation prevents the reassociation of cyclinA/cdk2 to the E2F4 containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of E2F activity and the inability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our data indicate that, in differentiating myocytes, one mechanism through which MyoD induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves p21 upregulation and suppression of the proliferation-associated cdks-containing E2F complexes formation."
https://openalex.org/W2028078410,"The c-ret proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase which plays an important role in kidney and enteric nervous system development. Germline mutations in c-ret are responsible for the dominantly inherited cancer syndromes, multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma as well as the developmental disorder Hirschsprung's disease. Using SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells stably transfected with an EGFR/Ret chimeric receptor, we have studied cellular consequences and signalling events following activation of exogenous EGFR/Ret and endogenous FGF and PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases in cells of neuroectodermal origin. Here we report that Ret activation led to cell scattering, growth inhibition and loss of anchorage-independent growth. Basic FGF, but not PDGF, evoked similar responses in those cells. Nevertheless, activation of all three receptor tyrosine kinases led to ERK2 activation. Analysis of the kinetics of ERK2 activation and downstream events revealed that Ret and FGF receptor activation led to sustained ERK2 activation and SRE transactivation, while PDGF treatment led to transient ERK2 activation and failed to induce SRE transactivation. Our results suggest that sustained, but not transient ERK2 activation may be involved in cell scattering."
https://openalex.org/W2330406924,"The oncogenic proteins encoded by papovaviruses, the tumor antigens, have been extensively used as model systems to study mitogenic signaling and cell transformation. These proteins stimulate cell growth in cultured cells and induce tumors in virus infected or transgenic animals. One of these proteins, polyomavirus middle-T, acts like a constitutively activated tyrosine growth factor receptor. Middle-T recruits several cellular enzymes into a multifunctional complex located at cellular membranes. This results in the activation of cellular enzymes involved in the regulation of cell signaling, like tyrosine kinases of the Src family, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and a GDP/GTP exchange factor for Ras. These activities are all required for stimulation of cell growth by middle-T and activate members of the MAP kinase family. Here we investigate the role of T antigen-activated pathways in the stimulation of transcription of immediate early genes. These genes are essential for progression of resting cells into S phase. Our data show that Rho family GTPases play an essential role in cell transformation by middle-T. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the c-fos promoter is activated by two Ras-initiated signaling cascades. One is Raf-dependent and requires binding of SHC and PI 3-kinase to the middle-T complex. This pathway signals via ternary complex factor (TCF) to the serum response element (SRE) of the c-fos promoter. Signaling to TCF by Raf also depends on functional Rac, but not CDC42, as demonstrated in luciferase reporter assays with an ETS domain-containing promoter. The second pathway is Raf-independent, does not require SHC but functional PI 3-kinase, and transduces signals via Rac to serum response factor (SRF). Microinjection of dominant negative Rac1 blocks nuclear translocation of ERK1 in middle-T-expressing cells. This lends support to the idea that the two signaling cascades initiated by Ras show crosstalk at the level of MAP kinase-mediated signaling to nuclear transcription factors."

https://openalex.org/W2328088858,"The PML-RAR alpha hybrid protein generated by the t(15;17) translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is thought to play a central role in the oncogenic process. However, analysis of the oncogenic activity of the fusion protein in tissue culture assays or in mice has been hampered by its apparent toxicity in multiple murine cells. To circumvent this problem, we generated an inducible line of transgenic mice, MT135, in which the expression of PML-RAR alpha is driven by the metallothionein promoter. After 5 days zinc stimulation, 27 out of 54 mice developed hepatic preneoplasia and neoplasia including foci of basophilic hepatocytes, dysplasia and carcinoma with a significantly higher incidence of lesions in females than in males. The rapid onset of liver pathologies was dependent on overexpression of the transgene since it was not detected in noninduced transgenic animals of the same age. The PML-RAR alpha protein was always present in altered tissues at much higher levels than in the surrounding normal liver tissues. In addition, overexpression of PML-RAR alpha resulted in a strong proliferative response in the hepatocytes. We conclude that overexpression of PML-RAR alpha deregulates cell proliferation and can induce tumorigenic changes in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2334314404,"Previous studies showed that the binding of p50/NFκB1 to particular κB DNA sites altered its conformation in a way that correlated with transcriptional activation. Here, we investigated the effects of protein – protein interactions on the transcriptional activity of p50. We show that the association of p50 with a mutant Rel-homology domain (RHD) defective for DNA binding led to synergistic activation of κB site-dependent transcription, whereas neither protein alone had any effect. Partial proteolytic analysis showed that the conformation of p50 in these complexes differed from that in wild-type c-Rel-RHD/p50 complexes, and correlated with activated transcription. These results suggest that the Rel-homology domain can act as an allosteric effector to promote transcription by p50/NFκB1 and that the configuration of p50 is important for its activity. This also suggests that Rel proteins can promote transcription by other Rel-family members without binding to their DNA recognition site. These studies emphasize the important role of protein – protein interactions in Rel and NFκB-mediated transcription."
