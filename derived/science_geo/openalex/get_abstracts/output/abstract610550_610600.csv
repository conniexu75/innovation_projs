The sources of these pathogens have been uncertain. O'Hanlon et al. used genomics on a panel of more than 200 isolates to trace the source of the frog pathogen B. dendrobatidis to a hyperdiverse hotspot in the Korean peninsula (see the Perspective by Lips). Over the past century, the trade in amphibian species has accelerated, and now all lineages of B. dendrobatidis occur in traded amphibians; the fungus has become ubiquitous and is diversifying rapidly.

This assumption leads to fisheries management practices that suggest that one large female fish can be replaced by several smaller females. However, this assumption is incorrect. Barneche et al. show that larger females are far more productive than the same weight's worth of smaller females. Management practices that ignore the value of large females could contribute to unexplained declines seen in some fish stocks. Science , this issue p. 642"

The genomic alterations and gene expression profiles characterizing this tumor type have been widely studied. Puchalski et al. created the Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas, a freely available online resource for the research community. The atlas, a collaborative effort between bioinformaticians and pathologists, maps molecular features of glioblastomas, such as transcriptional signatures, to histologically defined anatomical regions of the tumors. The relationships identified in this atlas, in conjunction with associated databases of clinical and genomic information, could provide new insights into the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of glioblastoma.

Capturing the complete structure of these multisubunit membrane-bound complexes has been hindered by their inherent ability to adopt multiple conformations. Srivastava et al. used protein engineering to freeze mitochondrial ATP synthase from yeast in a single conformation and obtained a structure with the inhibitor oligomycin, which binds to the rotating c-ring within the membrane. Hahn et al. show that chloroplast ATP synthase contains a built-in inhibitor triggered by oxidizing conditions in the dark chloroplast. The mechanisms by which these machines are powered are remarkably similar: Protons are shuttled through a channel to the membrane-embedded c-ring, where they drive nearly a full rotation of the rotor before exiting through another channel on the opposite side of the membrane (see the Perspective by Kane).

https://openalex.org/W2800724568,"Tackling microtubule-tau interactions Alzheimer's disease is a major cause of death in the elderly. Disease progression is associated with the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles composed of tau, a protein important for neuronal development and function. Tangle formation is preceded by phosphorylation events that cause tau to dissociate from its native binding partner, microtubules. Microtubule-tau interactions have been mysterious. Kellogg et al. used cryo–electron microscopy and molecular modeling to show how tau interacts with the outer surface of the microtubule, stapling together tubulin subunits and thus stabilizing the polymer. A key tau amino acid within the tightly bound segment between tubulin subunits corresponds to a clinically relevant site of tau phosphorylation, explaining the competition between microtubule interaction and tau aggregation.

https://openalex.org/W2799850843,"Taking enantiomers for a spin There are two common ways to distinguish mirror-image molecules, or enantiomers. The first relies on their distinct interactions with circularly polarized light, the second on their interactions with a pure enantiomer of some other molecule. Now Banerjee-Ghosh et al. report a conceptually different approach to chiral resolution. Experiments showed that, depending on the direction of magnetization, chiral oligopeptides, oligonucleotides, and amino acids have enantiospecific differences in initial adsorption rates on ferromagnetic surfaces. This effect is attributed to enantiospecific induced spin polarization. Science , this issue p. 1331"

Glycolysis links to gene transcription via the essential coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in its oxidized state (NAD + ). Ryu et al. found that compartmentalized NAD + synthesis and consumption integrate glucose metabolism and adipogenic (fat-promoting) transcription during adipocyte differentiation (see the Perspective by Trefely and Wellen). Competition between the NAD + precursors—nuclear NMNAT-1 and cytosolic NMNAT-2—for their common substrate, nicotinamide mononucleotide, regulates the balance between nuclear NAD + synthesis for adipogenic gene regulation and cytosolic NAD + synthesis used in metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2800005259,"Clostridium difficile infection is the most common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in developed countries. The major virulence factor, C. difficile toxin B (TcdB), targets colonic epithelia by binding to the frizzled (FZD) family of Wnt receptors, but how TcdB recognizes FZDs is unclear. Here, we present the crystal structure of a TcdB fragment in complex with the cysteine-rich domain of human FZD2 at 2.5-angstrom resolution, which reveals an endogenous FZD-bound fatty acid acting as a co-receptor for TcdB binding. This lipid occupies the binding site for Wnt-adducted palmitoleic acid in FZDs. TcdB binding locks the lipid in place, preventing Wnt from engaging FZDs and signaling. Our findings establish a central role of fatty acids in FZD-mediated TcdB pathogenesis and suggest strategies to modulate Wnt signaling."

We have shown previously that airway epithelial cells express several T2Rs that activate innate immune responses that may be important for treatment of airway diseases such as chronic rhinosinusitis. It is imperative to more clearly understand what compounds activate airway T2Rs as well as their full range of functions. T2R isoforms in airway motile cilia (T2R4, -14, -16, and -38) produce bactericidal levels of nitric oxide (NO) that also increase ciliary beating, promoting clearance of mucus and trapped pathogens. Bacterial quorum-sensing acyl-homoserine lactones activate T2Rs and stimulate these responses in primary airway cells. Quinolones are another type of quorum-sensing molecule used by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To elucidate whether bacterial quinolones activate airway T2Rs, we analyzed calcium, cAMP, and NO dynamics using a combination of fluorescent indicator dyes and FRET-based protein biosensors. T2R-transfected HEK293T cells, several lung epithelial cell lines, and primary sinonasal cells grown and differentiated at the air–liquid interface were tested with 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone (known as Pseudomonas quinolone signal; PQS), 2,4-dihydroxyquinolone, and 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinolone (HHQ). In HEK293T cells, PQS activated T2R4, -16, and -38, whereas HHQ activated T2R14. 2,4-Dihydroxyquinolone had no effect. PQS and HHQ increased calcium and decreased both baseline and stimulated cAMP levels in cultured and primary airway cells. In primary cells, PQS and HHQ activated levels of NO synthesis previously shown to be bactericidal.

For frozen-thawed embryos, the concordance rate for whole chromosome copy number per sample was equivalent between NIPGS vs. TE biopsy, NIPGS vs. WB and TE vs. WB samples taken from the same embryo was 87.5%; 96.4% and 91.7% respectively (P>0.05), and the rate of concordance per single chromosome was 99.3%, 99.7% and 99.7%, respectively (P>0.05). In fresh cases (Day 4 to Day 5/6 culture), the concordance rate for whole chromosome copy number per sample between NIPGS vs. TE samples taken from the same embryo was 100%, and the rate of concordance per single chromosome was 98.2% (P>0.05).A combination of BCCM and BF contains sufficient embryonic DNA for whole genome amplification and accurate aneuploidy screening. Our findings suggest that aneuploidy screening using BCCM combined with BF could potentially serve as a novel NIPGS approach for use in human IVF."

https://openalex.org/W2801125237,"Surveillance of clandestine nuclear tests relies on a global seismic network, but the potential of spaceborne monitoring has been underexploited. We used satellite radar imagery to determine the complete surface displacement field of up to 3.5 meters of divergent horizontal motion with 0.5 meters of subsidence associated with North Korea's largest underground nuclear test. Combining insight from geodetic and seismological remote sensing, we found that the aftermath of the initial explosive deformation involved subsidence associated with subsurface collapse and aseismic compaction of the damaged rocks of the test site. The explosive yield from the nuclear detonation with best-fitting source parameters for 450-meter depth was 191 kilotonnes of TNT equivalent. Our results demonstrate the capability of spaceborne remote sensing to help characterize large underground nuclear tests."
https://openalex.org/W2802672152,"Objective Reducing environmental noise benefits premature infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICU), but excessive reduction may lead to sensory deprivation, compromising development. Instead of minimal noise levels, environments that mimic intrauterine soundscapes may facilitate infant development by providing a sound environment reflecting fetal life. This soundscape may support autonomic and emotional development in preterm infants. We aimed to assess the efficacy and feasibility of external non-invasive recordings in pregnant women, endeavoring to capture intra-abdominal or womb sounds during pregnancy with electronic stethoscopes and build a womb sound library to assess sound trends with gestational development. We also compared these sounds to popular commercial womb sounds marketed to new parents. Study design Intra-abdominal sounds from 50 mothers in their second and third trimester (13 to 40 weeks) of pregnancy were recorded for 6 minutes in a quiet clinic room with 4 electronic stethoscopes, placed in the right upper and lower quadrants, and left upper and lower quadrants of the abdomen. These recording were partitioned into 2-minute intervals in three different positions: standing, sitting and lying supine. Maternal and gestational age, Body Mass Index (BMI) and time since last meal were collected during recordings. Recordings were analyzed using long-term average spectral and waveform analysis, and compared to sounds from non-pregnant abdomens and commercially-marketed womb sounds selected for their availability, popularity, and claims they mimic the intrauterine environment. Results Maternal sounds shared certain common characteristics, but varied with gestational age. With fetal development, the maternal abdomen filtered high (500–5,000 Hz) and mid-frequency (100–500 Hz) energy bands, but no change appeared in contributions from low-frequency signals (10–100 Hz) with gestational age. Variation appeared between mothers, suggesting a resonant chamber role for intra-abdominal space. Compared to commercially-marketed sounds, womb signals were dominated by bowel sounds, were of lower frequency, and showed more variation in intensity. Conclusions High-fidelity intra-abdominal or womb sounds during pregnancy can be recorded non-invasively. Recordings vary with gestational age, and show a predominance of low frequency noise and bowel sounds which are distinct from popular commercial products. Such recordings may be utilized to determine whether sounds influence preterm infant development in the NICU."

https://openalex.org/W2799901854,"Structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain-containing 1 (Smchd1) plays important roles in epigenetic silencing and normal mammalian development. Recently, heterozygous mutations in SMCHD1 have been reported in two disparate disorders: facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 (FSHD2) and Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome (BAMS). FSHD2-associated mutations lead to loss of function; however, whether BAMS is associated with loss- or gain-of-function mutations in SMCHD1 is unclear. Here, we have assessed the effect of SMCHD1 missense mutations from FSHD2 and BAMS patients on ATP hydrolysis activity and protein conformation and the effect of BAMS mutations on craniofacial development in a Xenopus model. These data demonstrated that FSHD2 mutations only result in decreased ATP hydrolysis, whereas many BAMS mutations can result in elevated ATPase activity and decreased eye size in Xenopus. Interestingly, a mutation reported in both an FSHD2 patient and a BAMS patient results in increased ATPase activity and a smaller Xenopus eye size. Mutations in the extended ATPase domain increased catalytic activity, suggesting critical regulatory intramolecular interactions and the possibility of targeting this region therapeutically to boost SMCHD1's activity to counter FSHD.

https://openalex.org/W2801632433,"Telomerase activation protects cells from telomere damage by delaying senescence and inducing cell immortalization, whereas telomerase inhibition mediates rapid senescence or apoptosis. However, the cellular mechanisms that determine telomere damage–dependent senescence versus apoptosis induction are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that telomerase instability mediated by silencing of sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which binds and stabilizes telomerase, induces telomere damage–dependent caspase-3 activation and apoptosis, but not senescence, in p16-deficient lung cancer cells or tumors. These outcomes were prevented by knockdown of a tumor-suppressor protein, transcription factor 21 (TCF21), or by ectopic expression of WT human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) but not mutant hTERT with altered S1P binding. Interestingly, SphK2-deficient mice exhibited accelerated aging and telomerase instability that increased telomere damage and senescence via p16 activation especially in testes tissues, but not in apoptosis. Moreover, p16 silencing in SphK2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts activated caspase-3 and apoptosis without inducing senescence. Furthermore, ectopic WT p16 expression in p16-deficient A549 lung cancer cells prevented TCF21 and caspase-3 activation and resulted in senescence in response to SphK2/S1P inhibition and telomere damage. Mechanistically, a p16 mutant with impaired caspase-3 association did not prevent telomere damage–induced apoptosis, indicating that an association between p16 and caspase-3 proteins forces senescence induction by inhibiting caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. These results suggest that p16 plays a direct role in telomere damage–dependent senescence by limiting apoptosis via binding to caspase-3, revealing a direct link between telomere damage–dependent senescence and apoptosis with regards to aging and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2799328474,"Circadian information is maintained in mammalian tissues by a cell-autonomous network of transcriptional feedback loops that have evolved to optimally regulate tissue-specific functions. An analysis of daily gene expression in different tissues, as well as an evaluation of inter-tissue circadian variability, is crucial for a systems-level understanding of this transcriptional circuitry. Affymetrix gene chip measurements of liver, muscle, adipose, and lung tissues were obtained from a rich time series light/dark experiment, involving 54 normal rats sacrificed at 18 time points within the 24-hr cycle. Our analysis revealed a high degree of circadian regulation with a variable distribution of phases among the four tissues. Interestingly, only a small number of common genes maintain circadian activity in all tissues, with many of them consisting of ""core-clock"" components with synchronous rhythms. Our results suggest that inter-tissue circadian variability is a critical component of homeostatic body function and is mediated by diverse signaling pathways that ultimately lead to highly tissue-specific transcription regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2801313224,"Purpose To examine predictors of information seeking behavior among individuals diagnosed with cancer versus those without. Methods Cross-sectional data from the Health Information National Trends Survey 4 Cycles 1–3 (October 2011 to November 2013) were analyzed for 10,774 survey respondents aged ≥18 years. Binary logistic regression was used to examine the effect of socio-demographic and behavioral factors on health information seeking. Results Cancer diagnosis did not predict health information seeking. However, respondents diagnosed with cancer were more likely to seek health information from a healthcare practitioner. Compared to males, females were more likely to seek health information irrespective of cancer diagnosis. Regardless of cancer diagnosis, those without a regular healthcare provider were less likely to seek health information. Likelihood of seeking health information declined across education strata, and significantly worsened among respondents without high school diplomas irrespective of cancer diagnosis. Conclusions Respondents sought health information irrespective of cancer diagnosis. However, the source of health information sought differed by cancer diagnosis. Gender, education, and having a regular healthcare provider were predictors of health information seeking. Future health communication interventions targeting cancer patients and the general public should consider these findings for tailored interventions to achieve optimal results."

The allelic variant CYP2C9*30 (A477T) is associated to diminished response to the antihypertensive effects of the prodrug losartan and affected metabolism of other drugs. Here, we investigated molecular mechanisms involved in the functional consequences of this amino-acid substitution. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed for the active species of the enzyme (heme in the Compound I state), in the apo or substrate-bound state, and binding energy analyses gave insights into altered protein structure and dynamics involved in the defective drug metabolism of human CYP2C9.30. Our data revealed an increased rigidity of the key Substrate Recognition Sites SRS1 and SRS5 and shifting of the β turn 4 of SRS6 toward the helix F in CYP2C9.30. Channel and binding substrate dynamics analyses showed altered substrate channel access and active site accommodation. These conformational and dynamic changes are believed to be involved in the governing mechanism of the reduced catalytic activity. An ensemble of representative conformations of the WT and A477T mutant properly accommodating drug substrates were identified, those structures can be used for prediction of new CYP2C9 and CYP2C9.30 substrates and drug-drug interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2801273198,"We previously identified brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a source of sleep-inducing signals. Pharmacological activation of BAT enhances sleep while sleep loss leads to increased BAT thermogenesis. Recovery sleep after sleep loss is diminished in mice that lack uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), and also in wild-type (WT) mice after sensory denervation of the BAT. Systemic inflammation greatly affects metabolism and the function of adipose tissue, and also induces characteristic sleep responses. We hypothesized that sleep responses to acute inflammation are mediated by BAT-derived signals. To test this, we determined the effects of systemic inflammation on sleep and body temperature in UCP-1 knockout (KO) and WT mice. Intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1 beta and clodronate containing liposomes were used to induce systemic inflammation. In WT animals, non-rapid-eye movement sleep (NREMS) was elevated in all four inflammatory models. All NREMS responses were completely abolished in UCP-1 KO animals. Systemic inflammation elicited an initial hypothermia followed by fever in WT mice. The hypothermic phase, but not the fever, was abolished in UCP-1 KO mice. The only recognized function of UCP-1 is to promote thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. Present results indicate that the presence of UCP-1 is necessary for increased NREMS but does not contribute to the development of fever in systemic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2800106181,"Objective Patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) are at increased risk for bacterial infections. It is not fully understood how exposure to infections induces further development of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). This study estimated risks of infection associated with HE among patients with LC. Methods A nested case-control study of 14,428 adult patients with LC was performed using the population-based Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 in Taiwan. Cases were cirrhotic patients who developed HE during follow-up. Controls were matched to each case by age at LC diagnosis (±2 years), sex, Charlson Comorbid index score, year of LC, and follow-up time with a 1:1 ratio. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine and compare the odds of developing HE based on exposure to various risk factors, including site of infection, cirrhosis-related complications, Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy, and peptic ulcer bleeding. Patient survival was evaluated using the time-dependent Cox regression model. Results Cirrhotic patients with HE (n = 714) and without HE (n = 714) were matched to compare risks. Infections and more frequent yearly infections were significantly associated with increased risk of HE. Independent predictors of HE included spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (aOR, 5.13; 95% CI, 3.03–8.69), sepsis (aOR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.82–-3.53), and biliary tract infection (aOR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.2–3.46), controlling for confounders. Conclusion Frequent infections are associated with increased risk of HE in cirrhotic patients. More frequent exposure to infection increases the risk of HE and mortality rates. Appropriate prevention of infection and the use of antibiotics for cirrhotic patients at risk for HE are needed."

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the correlation between frontal skull Hounsfield unit (HU) values from brain computed tomography (CT) scans and T-scores of the lumbar spine and femoral neck from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans.Patients with < 1 year between brain CT and DXA scans were included in the study. The average frontal skull HU value used for analysis was defined as the average of four HU values of the frontal bone. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated, and area under the curve (AUC) was used to determine the HU values of the frontal skull for predicting osteoporosis. The frontal skull HU value with the highest sensitivity and specificity was considered the optimal cutoff value.In total, 899 patients who underwent both brain CT and DXA scans at a single institution were enrolled. Average skull HU values differed significantly among patients in different bone mineral density categories (p < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between skull HU value and T-score (β = 105.06, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.343). The mean HU value in subjects with osteoporosis was 515, and the optimal cutoff value for the prediction of osteoporosis was 610 HU (AUC = 0.775, 95% CI 0.744-0.806, p < 0.001).Clinical brain CT scans can assist in the detection of osteoporosis, and patients with an HU value < 610 as determined via brain CT may be considered for further evaluation for possible osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2801447818,"S100A16 is a conserved member of the S100 protein family in mammals. Its upregulation was observed in many tumors and is related to malignant transformation. In this study, we explored the independent prognostic value of S100A16 in terms of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) by performing a retrospective study, using data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Besides, by using deep sequencing data in TCGA-LUAD, we also explored the association between S100A16 expression and its DNA methylation and copy number alterations (CNAs). Results showed that the primary LUAD tissues (N = 514) had significantly elevated S100A16 expression compared with the normal lung tissues (N = 59). Based on OS data of 502 primary LUAD cases, we found that high S100A16 expression was correlated with inferior OS. The following univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that increased S100A16 expression was an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS (HR: 1.197, 95%CI: 1.050–1.364, p = 0.007) and RFS (HR: 1.206, 95%CI: 1.045–1.393, p = 0.011). By examining the DNA methylation data in TCGA-LUAD, we found that some S100A16 DNA CpG sites were generally hypermethylated in normal tissues, but not in LUAD tissues. Regression analysis identified a moderately negative correlation between S100A16 expression and its DNA methylation. In comparison, although DNA amplification (+1/+2) was frequent (378/511, 74%) in LUAD patients, it was not associated with increased S100A16 expression. Based on findings above, we infer that aberrant S100A16 expression might be modulated by its DNA hypomethylation and serves as an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS and RFS in LUAD."
https://openalex.org/W2802314553,"Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme borreliosis, can elude hosts’ innate and adaptive immunity as part of the course of infection. The ability of B. burgdorferi to invade or be internalized by host cells in vitro has been proposed as a mechanism for the pathogen to evade immune responses or antimicrobials. We have previously shown that B. burgdorferi can be internalized by human neuroglial cells. In this study we demonstrate that these cells take up B. burgdorferi via coiling phagocytosis mediated by the formin, Daam1, a process similarly described for human macrophages. Following coincubation with glial cells, B. burgdorferi was enwrapped by Daam1-enriched coiling pseudopods. Coiling of B. burgdorferi was significantly reduced when neuroglial cells were pretreated with anti-Daam1 antibody indicating the requirement for Daam1 for borrelial phagocytosis. Confocal microscopy showed Daam1 colocalizing to the B. burgdorferi surface suggesting interaction with borrelial membrane protein(s). Using the yeast 2-hybrid system for identifying protein-protein binding, we found that the B. burgdorferi surface lipoprotein, BBA66, bound the FH2 subunit domain of Daam1. Recombinant proteins were used to validate binding by ELISA, pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation. Evidence for native Daam1 and BBA66 interaction was suggested by colocalization of the proteins in the course of borrelial capture by the Daam1-enriched pseudopodia. Additionally, we found a striking reduction in coiling for a BBA66-deficient mutant strain compared to BBA66-expressing strains. These results show that coiling phagocytosis is a mechanism for borrelial internalization by neuroglial cells mediated by Daam1."

We demonstrate the potential for images posted to the website Twitter to capture variability in vegetation phenology across United States National Parks. We process a subset of images posted to Twitter within eight U.S. National Parks, with the aim of understanding the amount of green vegetation in each image. Analysis of the relative greenness of the images show statistically significant seasonal cycles across most National Parks at the 95% confidence level, consistent with springtime green-up and fall senescence. Additionally, these social media-derived greenness indices correlate with monthly mean satellite NDVI (r = 0.62), reinforcing the potential value these data could provide in constraining models and observing regions with limited high quality scientific monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2800807117,"Background Mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE) is an increasingly used echocardiography technique to assess left ventricular (LV) function. However, reproducibility and dependence on echocardiographic image quality for MAPSE in pediatric patients have not been studied to date. Methods We analyzed 284 transthoracic echocardiograms performed on consecutive normotensive children without structural heart disease (mean age 12.6±3.1 years, 50.4% female). B-mode and M-mode derived MAPSE measurements were performed and analyzed regarding inter- and intraobserver reliability and the influence of echocardiographic image quality. Results Overall, MAPSE measurements were highly reproducible with only minor bias. Both inter- and intraobserver reliability were significantly better for M-mode derived MAPSE (p<0.001). Echocardiographic image quality did not significantly influence M-mode MAPSE reproducibility (p>0.235). In contrast, B-mode lateral MAPSE was significantly better reproducible in optimal image quality (-0.07±1.04) when compared to suboptimal echocardiographic images (0.42±1.59, p<0.001). Moreover, poor quality images yielded significantly lower M-mode MAPSE values (14.3±2 mm) than near-optimal (15.2±1.9 mm, p<0.001) or optimal images (15.1±2.2 mm, p = 0.006). Conclusion Echocardiographic image quality essentially has a negligible effect on MAPSE reproducibility and measurements. Consequently, MAPSE is a robust echocardiographic parameter with convincing reproducibility for the assessment of LV function in children—even in patients with substandard imaging conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2801403906,"Treatment of prosthetic joint infections often involves multiple surgeries and prolonged antibiotic administration, resulting in a significant burden to patients and the healthcare system. We are exploring a non-invasive method to eradicate biofilm on metal implants utilizing high-frequency alternating magnetic fields (AMF) which can achieve surface induction heating. Although proof-of-concept studies demonstrate the ability of AMF to eradicate biofilm in vitro, there is a legitimate safety concern related to the potential for thermal damage to surrounding tissues when considering heating implanted metal objects. The goal of this study was to explore the feasibility of detecting acoustic emissions associated with boiling at the interface between a metal implant and surrounding soft tissue as a wireless safety sensing mechanism. Acoustic emissions generated during in vitro and in vivo AMF exposures were captured with a hydrophone, and the relationship with surface temperature analyzed. The effect of AMF exposure power, surrounding media composition, implant location within the AMF transmitter, and implant geometry on acoustic detection during AMF therapy was also evaluated. Acoustic emissions were reliably identified in both tissue-mimicking phantom and mouse studies, and their onset coincided with the implant temperature reaching the boiling threshold. The viscosity of the surrounding medium did not impact the production of acoustic emissions; however, emissions were not present when the medium was oil due to the higher boiling point. Results of simulations and in vivo studies suggest that short-duration, high-power AMF exposures combined with acoustic sensing can be used to minimize the amount of thermal damage in surrounding tissues. These studies support the hypothesis that detection of boiling associated acoustic emissions at a metal/tissue interface could serve as a real-time, wireless safety indicator during AMF treatment of biofilm on metallic implants."

https://openalex.org/W2800556277,"Widening the genetic basis of leaf rust resistance is a primary objective of the global durum wheat breeding effort at the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center (CIMMYT). Breeding programs in North America are following suit, especially after the emergence of new races of Puccinia triticina such as BBG/BP and BBBQD in Mexico and the United States, respectively. This study was conducted to characterize and map previously undescribed genes for leaf rust resistance in durum wheat and to develop reliable molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding. Four recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping populations derived from the resistance sources Amria, Byblos, Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2, which were crossed to the susceptible line ATRED #2, were evaluated for their reaction to the Mexican race BBG/BP of P. triticina. Genetic analyses of host reactions indicated that leaf rust resistance in these genotypes was based on major seedling resistance genes. Allelism tests among resistant parents supported that Amria and Byblos carried allelic or closely linked genes. The resistance in Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2 also appeared to be allelic. Bulked segregant analysis using the Infinium iSelect 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array identified two genomic regions for leaf rust resistance; one on chromosome 6BS for Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2 and the other on chromosome 7BL for Amria and Byblos. Polymorphic SNPs identified within these regions were converted to kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) assays and used to genotype the RIL populations. KASP markers usw215 and usw218 were the closest to the resistance genes in Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2, while usw260 was closely linked to the resistance genes in Amria and Byblos. DNA sequences associated with these SNP markers were anchored to the wild emmer wheat (WEW) reference sequence, which identified several candidate resistance genes. The molecular markers reported herein will be useful to effectively pyramid these resistance genes with other previously marked genes into adapted, elite durum wheat genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2800683872,"Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) plays a central role in chronic kidney diseases. TGF-β1 induction causes podocyte injury, which results in proteinuria and renal failure. However, the effect of the prostaglandin E2 /E-prostanoid receptor (EP2) on TGF-β1-induced podocyte injury remains unknown. Previous studies have shown that phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt is widespread in cells, and is vital for the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and metabolism. In this study, we cultured immortalized mouse podocytes in vitro in different groups: control group; TGF-β1 (5ng/ml) group; EP2 agonist Butaprost treatment (10−7, 10−6, or 10-5mol/L) +TGF-β1 group; EP2 antagonist AH6809 treatment (10−7, 10−6, or 10-5mol / L) + TGF-β1 group. We found that compared with the control group, proliferation of podocytes in the TGF-β1 group significantly decreased and apoptosis increased. Expression of cAMP decreased, whereas PGE2 increased. Meanwhile, expressions of nephrin, podocin and CD2AP mRNA and protein were dramatically downregulated, activated caspase-3 was increased, and activated PI3K/Akt activity were depressed. Butaprost intervention promoted podocyte proliferation with reduced apoptosis. Conversely, AH6809 intervention led to opposite results (P<0.05). Our findings suggested that EP2 agonist protects podocytes by increasing expression of cAMP, which creates feedback of inhibiting PGE2 expression. This causes the interaction of nephrin, podocin and CD2AP resulting the inhibition of apoptosis induced by activation of the PI3K / Akt signaling pathway."

However, the association between the epithelial barrier and CCL17 expression has not been studied in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP). Thus, we aimed to evaluate the expression of CCL17 and its regulation by Th cytokines in nasal polyp (NP) epithelial cells.The expression and distribution of CCL17, CCL22, E-cadherin and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were measured using real-time PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry and compared between normal ethmoid sinus epithelium and NP epithelium. In addition, the expression level of CCL17 was determined in cultured epithelial cells treated with IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-α, and IFN-γ.The expression of CCL17 was decreased in the NP epithelium compared to the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus, whereas the expression of CCL22 was not decreased. E-cadherin was differentially distributed between the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus and NP epithelium. EGFR was also decreased in NPs. Interestingly, the stimulation of cultured epithelial cells with Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5, resulted in an upregulation of CCL17 expression only in NP epithelial cells whereas the expression of CCL17 was increased in both normal epithelial cells and NP epithelial cells by Th1 cytokines.Our results suggest that the decreased expression of CCL17 in defective NP epithelium may be closely connected to NP pathogenesis and can be differentially regulated by cytokines in the NP epithelium of patients with CRSwNP."

We evaluated the seasonal peaks and risk factors (gestational age [GA], chronologic age [CA], and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]) associated with the RSVH of preterm infants. The length of hospital stays (LOS), care in intensive care unit (ICU), and use of mechanical ventilation (MV) were also analyzed.There is a total duration of 9 months of RSVH season in Taiwan, three seasonal peaks and two seasonal peaks of RSVH in preterm infants with BPD and without BPD, respectively. Preterm infants had significantly higher RSVH rate than term infants (2.6% vs 0.9%, p<0.0001). Preterm infants born at 29-35 weeks of gestational age (wGA) with BPD had significantly higher RSVH rate than those without BPD (p<0.0001). Preterm infants without BPD born at < 32 wGA had higher RSVH rate than those born at 33-35 wGA (p<0.0001). Overall, 56.4% of RSVH occurred within 9 months of CA. Preterm infants with BPD had significantly higher ICU admission rate within 18 months of CA (p<0.0001), MV usage within 12 months of CA (p<0.0001) and LOS within 18 months of CA (p<0.001) than those without BPD. RSVH occurred within 6 months of CA was significantly associated with higher ICU admission rate (p<0.0001), MV usage (p = 0.0002) and longer LOS (p<0.001) in preterm infants without BPD.There is a total duration of 9 months of RSVH season in Taiwan.

https://openalex.org/W2800326618,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a hematopoietic malignancy originating from T-cell progenitors in which differentiation is blocked at early stages. Physiological expression of specific NKL homeobox genes obeys a hematopoietic NKL-code implicated in the process of lymphopoiesis while in differentiated T-cells these genes are silenced. We propose that this developmental expression pattern underlies the observation that NKL homeobox genes are the most ubiquitous group of transcription factors deregulated in T-ALL, including TLX1, TLX3, NKX2-5 and NKX3-1. Here, we describe a novel member of the NKL homeobox gene subclass, NKX3-2 (BAPX1), which is aberrantly activated in 18% of pediatric T-ALL patients analyzed while being normally expressed in developing spleen. Identification of NKX3-2 expression in T-ALL cell line CCRF-CEM qualified these cells to model its deregulation and function in a leukemic context. Genomic and chromosomal analyses demonstrated normal configuration of the NKX3-2 locus at chromosome 4p15, thus excluding cytogenetic dysregulation. Comparative expression profiling analysis of NKX3-2 patient data revealed deregulated activity of BMP- and MAPK-signalling. These candidate pathways were experimentally confirmed to mediate aberrant NKX3-2 expression. We also show that homeobox gene SIX6, plus MIR17HG and GATA3 are downstream targets of NKX3-2 and plausibly contribute to the pathogenesis of this malignancy by suppressing T-cell differentiation. Finally, NKL homeobox gene NKX2-5 was activated by NKX3-2 in CCRF-CEM and by FOXG1 in PEER, representing mutually inhibitory activators of this translocated oncogene. Together, our findings reveal a novel oncogenic NKL homeobox gene subclass member which is aberrantly expressed in a large subset of T-ALL patients and participates in a deregulated gene network likely to arise in developing spleen."

Here, using a custom ChIP tiling array to map chromatin modifications, we show that interferon-γ-induced DNA binding of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), typically associated with the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), causes histone acetylation (H3ac, H4ac). In contrast, among IRF1 sites lacking concomitant STAT1 recruitment, only 25% underwent inducible histone acetylation, 31% exhibited constitutive histone acetylation, and 44% had no histone acetylation. These latter “orphan sites” also lacked other activating modifications (e.g. H3K4me1, H3K4me2) and were typically remote from transcription start sites. In these cases the closest gene was typically an IFNγ-inducible locus that did not respond to IFNγ in this setting. Orphan sites were detected in different cell types, suggesting broad relevance. Despite an atypical downstream response (i.e. no histone modifications), IRF1 binding depended on SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, member 4 (SMARCA4 or BRG1), as is typical of active IRF1 enhancers. Although SMARCA4 permitted IRF1 access to the orphan sites, there was no corecruitment of the histone acetyltransferases CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300. Orphan sites were constitutively unacetylated, and several were marked with repressive chromatin modifications (e.g. H3K27me3).

Gene induction requires recruitment of a large posse of proteins, resulting in the formation of an RNA polymerase preinitiation complex that is subsequently activated to generate a transcript. The multiprotein complex needed to induce transcription is recruited in an orderly cascade that includes activator proteins that bind directly to short DNA motifs, coactivators that bind activators and move or chemically modify nucleosomes, and general transcription factors that associate with activators and coactivators (1Cosma M.P. Ordered recruitment: gene-specific mechanism of transcription activation.Mol.

The entire cascade can take minutes, for example at cytokine- or growth factor-induced genes, or days, such as at differentiation-responsive gene targets (2Cosma M.P. Tanaka T. Nasmyth K.

Chemical modification of histones is a universal theme during gene activation and can include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and other post-translational events (5Bemer M.

Multiple studies of individual or a few genes have suggested that cofactor binding and histone modification inevitably follow activator recruitment. However, it is unclear whether activator binding is always sufficient to induce cofactor recruitment and histone modifications. In vitro work showed that cofactor recruitment is more efficient when multiple activators are cobound to an enhancer, presenting a larger and higher-affinity binding surface (6Merika M. Williams A.J. Chen G. Collins T. Thanos D. Recruitment of CBP/p300 by the IFNβ enhanceosome is required for synergistic activation of transcription.Mol.

Interferon-γ is an immune cytokine that can induce the expression of hundreds IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Receptor binding to the extracellular surface triggers activation of Janus kinase 1 on the intracellular side, which phosphorylates the transcription activator STAT1. Phosphorylated STAT1 forms dimers that translocate to the nucleus, bind to γ-activated sequence motifs, and induce expression of ISGs (9Negishi H. Taniguchi T. Yanai H. The interferon (IFN) class of cytokines and the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) transcription factor family.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2017; (pii, a028423) (28963109)10.1101/cshperspect.a028423Google Scholar). One of the major early targets of activated STAT1 is the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), which cooperates with STAT1 to induce a second wave of ISGs. One such target of STAT1 and IRF1 is the class II transactivator (CIITA, or MHC2TA), which is the master regulator of major histocompatibility complex class II gene induction (10Suzuki K. Luo Y. Histone acetylation and the regulation of major histocompatibility class II gene expression.Adv. Protein Chem. Struct.

This entire cascade of gene induction takes only 5–6 h and represents an ideal system to study events associated with activator binding. Recently, we reported that there are twice as many IRF1 versus STAT1-binding events, and although STAT1 is usually found in close proximity to IRF1, the reverse is not the case (11Abou El Hassan M. Huang K. Eswara M.B. Xu Z. Yu T. Aubry A. Ni Z. Livne-Bar I. Sangwan M. Ahmad M. Bremner R. Properties of STAT1 and IRF1 enhancers and the influence of SNPs.BMC Mol. Biol. 2017; 18 (28274199): 610.1186/s12867-017-0084-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Whether there are other fundamental differences in the effect of recruiting these two factors is unknown. Both STAT1 and IRF1 can recruit cofactors that modify chromatin. Of particular relevance here is their ability to bind to several HATs. In view of their common ability to recruit HATs and their cooperative role in the same pathway, one might expect that histones at the enhancers they interact with would be modified accordingly. However, work on the IFNγ-responsive GBP2 promoter revealed that when STAT1 is mutated to prevent DNA binding, IRF1 is still recruited but does not induce histone acetylation (12Ramsauer K. Farlik M. Zupkovitz G. Seiser C. Kröger A. Hauser H. Decker T. Distinct modes of action applied by transcription factors STAT1 and IRF1 to initiate transcription of the IFN-γ-inducible gbp2 gene.Proc. Natl.

The degree to which this occurs in physiological settings is unknown, as are the distinguishing features of such inactive enhancers. Our prior genome-scale analysis identified many isolated (STAT1-free) IRF1 sites (11Abou El Hassan M. Huang K. Eswara M.B. Xu Z. Yu T. Aubry A. Ni Z. Livne-Bar I. Sangwan M. Ahmad M. Bremner R. Properties of STAT1 and IRF1 enhancers and the influence of SNPs.BMC Mol. Biol. 2017; 18 (28274199): 610.1186/s12867-017-0084-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), allowing us to address the degree to which IRF1-binding affects histone modification in vivo. It also allowed us to deduce whether there is any location bias for different classes of IRF1 enhancers, and the chromatin features associated with these subtypes. We identified many isolated IFNγ-induced IRF1-binding events that can induce histone acetylation independent of STAT1, but equally almost half of all such isolated IRF1 sites did not induce histone acetylation or other activating histone modifications. Most of these “orphan sites” were at remote locations, not promoters, but the nearest gene was typically an unresponsive (resistant) ISG. Orphan IRF1 sites did not recruit coactivators and were associated with silencing chromatin marks. Thus, although IRF1 can access repressive chromatin, the local environment appears to define its ability to trigger STAT1-independent enhanceosome formation.

For ChIP analysis we used antibodies that recognize H3 acetylated on residues Lys9 and Lys14 or H4 acetylated on Lys5, Lys8, Lys12, and Lys16.

ChIP–qPCR was used to validate our ChIP-chip data (Fig. 1B). A detailed summary of the numbers of H3ac and H4ac peaks across studied regions is provided in Table S1. We detected a total of 703 separate positions with acetylated histones (H3ac and/or H4ac) in untreated cells, occupying a total of 788 kb of sequence, with average peak width of 1120 bp (range 479–7210), covering 5% of the studied chromatin. After IFNγ treatment, there were 747 acetylated positions that occupied 852 kb, an average of 1140 bp per peak (range 479–8429). In total, 247 of 747 sites exhibited inducible histone acetylation (a mix of off/on and on/up) (Table S1), which was not associated with a global increase in total H3ac and/or H4ac. 4M. Abou El Hassan and R. Bremner, unpublished data. Only one H3ac site showed a statistically significant drop in acetylation. Thus, as expected, IFNγ treatment triggers chromatin acetylation. The scope of H3ac was similar in untreated versus treated cells (677 peaks covering 714 kb in untreated cells versus 629 covering 686 kb in IFNγ-treated cells). The slight “drop” in H3ac peaks after treatment mainly reflects a reduction in marginal (although significant) basal acetylation. In contrast, there were far fewer basal H4ac than H3ac peaks (192, 3.5-fold less than H3ac, covering 160 kb, 4.5-fold less than H3ac). A prior study also noted stronger and wider H3ac signals compared with H4ac at promoters and enhancers (13Heintzman N.D. Stuart R.K. Hon G. Fu Y. Ching C.W. Hawkins R.D. Barrera L.O. Van Calcar S. Qu C. Ching K.A. Wang W. Weng Z. Green R.D. Crawford G.E. Ren B. Distinct and predictive chromatin signatures of transcriptional promoters and enhancers in the human genome.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39 (17277777): 311-31810.1038/ng1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). However, we found that H4ac rose considerably after IFNγ treatment (to 394 sites covering 399 kb, now only 1.6- and 1.7-fold less than H3ac, respectively). In IFNγ-treated cells, 91 (14%) H3ac sites versus 156 (40%) H4ac sites were cytokine-induced. Thus, basal acetylation is biased toward H3, whereas IFNγ-induced acetylation is biased toward H4. Next, we assessed the position of H3ac and H4ac sites relative to gene starts. 64 and 63% of all acetylated sites were within 5 kb of known gene starts in untreated or treated cells, respectively (Table S1). Similar distributions were observed individually for either all H3ac sites (65% −IFNγ, 68% + IFNγ), all H4ac sites (69% −IFNγ, 61% +IFNγ), or constitutive H3ac (67%) and constitutive H4ac (64%) (Fig. 2A, Fig. S2A, and Table S1). However, induced H3ac sites were more likely to be promoter-proximal (73%) compared with induced H4ac sites (56%) (Fig. 2B and Table S1). Randomly generated sites did not show this pattern (Fig. S2B). Thus, in line with previous work (14Roh T.Y. Cuddapah S. Zhao K.

Next we assessed the degree of overlap of H3ac and H4ac marks. Basal H3ac sites were typically isolated (79%, 524 of 677), whereas the majority of H4ac sites colocalized with H3ac (72%), consistent with the larger number of H3ac sites (677 versus 192) (Table S1). Conceivably, constitutive H3ac sites prime IFNγ-induced histone acetylation because a large fraction of IFNγ-induced H3ac or H4ac sites were marked with basal H3ac (68 or 49%, respectively). Frequently, induced H3ac occurred at dual sites, and 63% (58 of 91) of inducible H3ac sites was observed at any H4 acetylated sites, whereas only 38% (201 of 542) of constitutive H3ac sites (i.e. unchanged − or + IFNγ) were dual (Table S1 and Fig. S2B), increasing total dual H3ac from 21% (139 of 677) before treatment to 39% (239 of 629) after IFNγ treatment (Table S1). In contrast, both constitutive and inducible H4ac sites showed comparable frequencies of overlap with any H3 acetylation (68 and 59%, respectively) (Fig. 2B). Randomly generated sites showed much less overlap with H3ac or H4ac (Fig. S2B). Thus, most basal H3ac is isolated and may prime IFNγ-induced acetylation, preferentially generating dual H3/4ac sites. Next, we assessed distribution of dual versus isolated marks at gene starts and/or distal locations. Dual H3ac sites were more common at promoter-proximal versus remote regions (2.5–2.9-fold enrichment for all, constitutive or inducible H3ac sites; Fig. 2B). There was a similar proximal bias for most categories of dual H4ac sites (Fig. 2B). Isolated H3ac sites were also skewed to gene promoters albeit to a lesser extent compared with dual sites (1.7–2.3-fold; Fig. 2B). In contrast, isolated (all, constitutive, or induced) H4ac sites were enriched at distal regions (1.2–1.7-fold; Fig. 2B). The preponderance of isolated inducible H4ac at remote sites was evident at multiple loci (e.g. STAT1 and CIITA/SOCS1 regions and GBP, IFI200, and IFIT clusters; Table S1). In summary, whereas isolated H3ac and dual H3ac/H4ac are predominately promoter proximal, isolated H4ac is more often located at distal elements, especially those induced by IFNγ. Regulatory elements at poised loci can be premarked with active chromatin marks (17Robertson A.G. Bilenky M. Tam A. Zhao Y. Zeng T. Thiessen N. Cezard T. Fejes A.P. Wederell E.D. Cullum R.

Of all 230 distinct TF-binding positions (Fig. 3A, STAT1 and/or IRF1), just under one half were preacetylated before IFNγ treatment. Most (66%) preacetylated TF sites were promoter proximal, which was higher (80%) at dual STAT1/IRF1 sites (Fig. 3A), suggesting a more suitable chromatin state for TF binding. The lower fraction of preacetylated remote TF-binding sites (34%) was similar to the 25% of STAT1 sites that show basal H3K4me (18Heintzman N.D. Hon G.C. Hawkins R.D. Kheradpour P. Stark A. Harp L.F.

Comparison of isolated STAT1 and IRF1 sites showed that the preacetylated fraction was similar for either TF at promoters (70%), but at remote locations 47% of STAT1 versus only 28% of IRF1 sites were preacetylated. Only 21% of remote dual IRF1 + STAT1 sites were preacetylated. In summary, preacetylation is common at ISG promoters, especially those that recruit both STAT1 and IRF1, but although it is seen at approximately half of remote STAT1 sites, most remote IRF1 sites are not preacetylated, including those that show dual IRF1/STAT1 binding. Next, we assessed whether IFNγ-induced acetylation correlates with STAT1/IRF1 binding. 69% of all inducible acetylation events occurred within 1 kb of STAT1/IRF1–binding sites and 90% were within 5 kb (Fig. 3B), which accords with previous results showing that STAT1 and IRF1 bind HATs (6Merika M.

The overlap between acetylation and TF binding was skewed to promoter proximal sites (Fig. 3B). Similar distributions were observed when all inducible H3ac or inducible H4ac sites were considered separately. 91% of dual inducible H3ac and H4ac sites were located within 1 kb of a TF-binding site (Fig. 3B). Although 70% of the isolated inducible H4ac were within 1 kb of a STAT1 or IRF1 binding site, only 36% of isolated inducible H3ac sites showed STAT1 or IRF1 binding. Negligible overlap was observed between STAT1/IRF1 peaks and randomly generated peaks (Fig. 3B). Overall, induction of histone acetylation correlates with STAT1/IRF1 binding, but a significant fraction of isolated H3ac modification could be due to recruitment of (an)other factor(s) or may occur indirectly through looping to one or more of the STAT1/IRF1–binding enhancers. STAT1 can recruit HATs (12Ramsauer K. Farlik M. Zupkovitz G. Seiser C. Kröger A. Hauser H. Decker T.

Whether and/or the extent to which such unproductive DNA binding applies at physiological IRF1 sites naturally lacking STAT1 is unclear. Our analysis revealed that 25% of isolated IRF1 sites showed inducible acetylation, 31% exhibited constitutive acetylation, and 44% lacked acetylation. The unacetylated IRF1 sites that lack STAT1 (i.e. unacetylated, isolated IRF1 sites) were labeled orphan sites to discriminate them from other IRF1 sites with concomitant STAT1 binding and/or histone acetylation. These data reveal distinct classes of IRF1 binding sites across the genome. Strikingly, 87% (53 of 61) of orphan sites were remote, whereas the majority (65%) of acetylated IRF1 sites were promoter proximal (Fig. 3C). Indeed, 49% (53 of 109) of all remote IRF1 sites were orphan. Thus, although STAT1 binding is almost always linked to acetylation, the effect of IRF1 recruitment is context-dependent. Next, we compared the distribution of orphan and nonorphan IRF1 sites in HeLa cells to different classes of IFNγ-target genes. Previously we compared HeLa transcriptome data with that of IFNγ-regulated genes in multiple other cells types and divided HeLa ISGS into those where IFNγ caused induction, no effect (resistant ISGs), or repression and whether the effect was early (detected by 6 h) or late (24 or 48 h) (11Abou El Hassan M.

Materials and methods A prospective physiologic study was carried out on 14 paediatric patients presenting with severe traumatic brain swelling treated with DC. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was performed on the middle cerebral artery bilaterally after DC. After assessment at ZEEP, intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP) and gas exchanges were recorded at PEEP 4 and PEEP 8. Results From ZEEP to PEEP 8, the compliance of respiratory system indexed to the weight of the patient significantly increased (P = 0.02) without ICP modifications. No significant variation of the MAP, CPP, Vmed, the total resistance of respiratory system and ohmic resistance of the respiratory system indexed to the weight of the patients was observed. CVP significantly increased between ZEEP and PEEP 8 (P = 0.005), and between PEEP 4 and PEEP 8 (P = 0.05). Conclusions PEEP values up to 8 cmH20 seem to be safe in paediatric patients with a severe post-traumatic brain swelling treated with DC."

Patients' characteristics (age, sex, and past medical history of influenza infection), clinical signs (axillary temperature, pulse rate, cough, joint and muscle pain, and history of fever [acute or sudden, gradual, and absence of fever]), duration from the onset of symptoms, severity of feeling sick compared with a common cold (severe, similar, and mild), self-reported likelihood of influenza (%), and results of rapid influenza diagnostic tests.At the optimal cut-off point (30%) for estimation of self-diagnosis of seasonal influenza, the positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was 1.46 (95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.00) and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) was 0.57 (0.35 to 0.93). At a 10% cut-off point, LR-was 0.33 (0.12 to 0.96). At an 80% cut-off point, LR+ was 2.75 (0.75 to 10.07). As for clinical signs, the combination of acute or sudden onset fever and cough had LR+ of 3.27 (1.68 to 6.35). Absence of cough showed LR-of 0.15 (0.04 to 0.61).Self-diagnosis of influenza using the optimal cut-off point (30%) was not found useful for ruling in or ruling out an influenza diagnosis. However, it could be useful when patients self-report extremely high (80%) or low (10%) probability of having influenza. Clinically useful signs were the combination of history of fever and cough, and absence of cough."

https://openalex.org/W2802592485,"Graph drawing, or the automatic layout of graphs, is a challenging problem. There are several search based methods for graph drawing which are based on optimizing an objective function which is formed from a weighted sum of multiple criteria. In this paper, we propose a new neighbourhood search method which uses a tabu search coupled with path relinking to optimize such objective functions for general graph layouts with undirected straight lines. To our knowledge, before our work, neither of these methods have been previously used in general multi-criteria graph drawing. Tabu search uses a memory list to speed up searching by avoiding previously tested solutions, while the path relinking method generates new solutions by exploring paths that connect high quality solutions. We use path relinking periodically within the tabu search procedure to speed up the identification of good solutions. We have evaluated our new method against the commonly used neighbourhood search optimization techniques: hill climbing and simulated annealing. Our evaluation examines the quality of the graph layout (objective function’s value) and the speed of layout in terms of the number of evaluated solutions required to draw a graph. We also examine the relative scalability of each method. Our experimental results were applied to both random graphs and a real-world dataset. We show that our method outperforms both hill climbing and simulated annealing by producing a better layout in a lower number of evaluated solutions. In addition, we demonstrate that our method has greater scalability as it can layout larger graphs than the state-of-the-art neighbourhood search methods. Finally, we show that similar results can be produced in a real world setting by testing our method against a standard public graph dataset."
https://openalex.org/W2799703199,"In mountainous landscapes, soil moisture is highly dynamic due to the effects of topography and the temporal variability imposed by seasonal precipitation, including rainfall and snow. Soil moisture is known to affect ecosystem carbon exchange both aboveground and belowground, as well as the stable isotopic composition of exchanged CO2. In this study we used an extensive suite of measurements to examine the effects of seasonal changes in soil moisture on the isotopic composition of soil CO2 production at the landscape level. We show that the seasonal decline in soil moisture (i.e., summer dry-down) appeared to impose a trend in the δ13C of soil CO2 production (δP) with more negative δP early in the growing season when soils were wet, and more positive δP as the growing season progressed and soils dried out. This seemingly generalizable pattern for a snow-dominated watershed is likely to represent the variability of recently assimilated C, tracked through the plant-soil system and imprinted in the respired CO2. Thus, our observations suggest that, at least for mountainous environments, seasonal changes in δP are largely mediated by soil moisture and their spatial variability is partially organized by topography."

https://openalex.org/W2802936946,"The present study investigated the interplay between selective inhibition (the ability to suppress specific competing responses) and nonselective inhibition (the ability to suppress any inappropriate response) during single word production. To this end, we combined two well-established research paradigms: the picture-word interference task and the stop-signal task. Selective inhibition was assessed by instructing participants to name target pictures (e.g., dog) in the presence of semantically related (e.g., cat) or unrelated (e.g., window) distractor words. Nonselective inhibition was tested by occasionally presenting a visual stop-signal, indicating that participants should withhold their verbal response. The stop-signal was presented early (250 ms) aimed at interrupting the lexical selection stage, and late (325 ms) to influence the word-encoding stage of the speech production process. We found longer naming latencies for pictures with semantically related distractors than with unrelated distractors (semantic interference effect). The results further showed that, at both delays, stopping latencies (i.e., stop-signal RTs) were prolonged for naming pictures with semantically related distractors compared to pictures with unrelated distractors. Taken together, our findings suggest that selective and nonselective inhibition, at least partly, share a common inhibitory mechanism during different stages of the speech production process."

Astronomers have immediately sifted the data for fast-moving stars. They are prized as forensic tools: When rewound, their trajectories point back to the violent events that launched them. Last week, one team reported the discovery of three white dwarfs—the dying embers of sunlike stars—hurtling through the galaxy at thousands of kilometers per second, perhaps flung out from supernovae explosions. Another group reported more than two dozen fast-moving stars, some apparently kicked out by our galaxy9s central black hole. And a third has confirmed that a star blazing through the outskirts of the Milky Way actually hails from another galaxy altogether, the Large Magellanic Cloud. The flood of discoveries has sent astronomers racing to their telescopes to check and classify the swift objects, says Harvard University astronomer James Guillochon."
