https://openalex.org/W2051538397,"Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are rapidly phosphorylated and activated in response to various extracellular stimuli in many different cell types. Such regulation of MAPK results from sequential activation of a series of protein kinases. The kinases that phosphorylate MAPKs, the MAP kinase kinases (MEKs) are also activated by phosphorylation. MEKs are related in sequence to the yeast protein kinases Byr1 (from Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and Ste7 (from Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which function in the pheromone-induced signaling pathway that results in mating. Byr1 and Ste7 are in turn regulated by the protein kinases Byr2 and Ste11. The amino acid sequence of the mouse homolog of Byr2 and Ste11, denoted MEKK (MEK kinase), was elucidated from a complementary DNA sequence encoding a protein of 672 amino acid residues (73 kilodaltons). MEKK was expressed in all mouse tissues tested, and it phosphorylated and activated MEK. Phosphorylation and activation of MEK by MEKK was independent of Raf, a growth factor-regulated protein kinase that also phosphorylates MEK. Thus, MEKK and Raf converge at MEK in the protein kinase network mediating the activation of MAPKs by hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters."
https://openalex.org/W2020708296,"Genomic imprinting, or parental allele-specific expression of genes, has been demonstrated at the molecular level in insects and mice but not in man. Imprinting as a potential mechanism of human disease is suggested by paternal uniparental disomy of 11p15 in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and by maternal uniparental disomy of 15q11-12 in Prader-Willi syndrome. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is characterized by multiorgan overgrowth and predisposition to embryonal tumours such as Wilms' tumour of the kidney. A loss of heterozygosity of 11p15 is also frequently found in a wide variety of tumours, including Wilms' tumour and lung, bladder, ovarian, liver and breast cancers; 11p15 also directly suppresses tumour growth in vitro. Two genes in this band, H19 and insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF2) undergo reciprocal imprinting in the mouse, with maternal expression of H19 (ref. 13) and paternal expression of IGF2 (ref. 14). Here we find that both of these genes show monoallelic expression in human tissues and, as in mouse, H19 is expressed from the maternal allele and IGF2 from the paternal allele. In contrast, 69% of Wilms' tumours not undergoing loss of heterozygosity at 11p showed biallelic expression of one or both genes, suggesting that relaxation or loss of imprinting could represent a new epigenetic mutational mechanism in carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2013955971,"Alternative splicing of precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) is a common mechanism of regulating gene expression. SR proteins are a family of pre-mRNA splicing factors that are structurally related and evolutionarily conserved. Any member of the SR family can complement a splicing-deficient extract that lacks the entire family of SR proteins. Here it is demonstrated that particular SR proteins have distinct functions in alternative pre-mRNA splicing in vitro. In addition, SR proteins are differentially expressed in a variety of tissues. These results suggest a fundamental role for SR proteins in the regulation of alternative splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1538865085,"Among the molecular mechanisms that have been proposed to contribute to long-term potentiation in hippocampus are the activation and autophosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II). Here we report that high, but not low frequency stimulation applied to two groups of CA1 afferents resulted in a long lasting increase in the Ca(2+)-independent and total activities of the enzyme as well as an increase in the ratio of Ca(2+)-independent to total activity. The effect was obtained using two different CaM kinase II substrates, it was observed in hippocampal slices and in hippocampal organotypic cultures, and it could be blocked by preincubation of slices with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate. Treatment of slices with calyculin A, a phosphatase inhibitor, modified the activity of the enzyme, but long term potentiation could still be induced and a further increase in Ca(2+)-independent CaM kinase II activity still observed."

https://openalex.org/W2047067502,"In pituitary gonadotropes, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) induces the rhythmic release of Ca2+ from an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive store. Simultaneous measurement of the concentration of cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and exocytosis in single identified gonadotropes showed that each elevation of [Ca2+]i induced a burst of exocytosis. These phenomena were largely suppressed by buffering of [Ca2+]i but persisted in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels by brief depolarizations seldom supplied enough Ca2+ for exocytosis, but [Ca2+]i elevations induced by photolysis of caged IP3 did trigger exocytosis, confirming that GnRH-stimulated gonadotropic hormone secretion is closely coupled to intracellular Ca2+ release. Agonist-induced oscillations of [Ca2+]i in secretory cells may be a mechanism to optimize the secretory output while avoiding the toxic effects of sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i."

https://openalex.org/W1556270435,"Poliovirus protein 2C belongs to an expanding group of proteins containing a nucleotide binding motif in their sequence. We present evidence that poliovirus 2C has nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) activity and binds to RNA. Poliovirus 2C was expressed in Escherichia coli cells as a fusion protein with the maltose binding protein (MBP). The fusion protein MBP-2C is efficiently cut by protease Xa within the 2C region. Thus, the fusion protein as such was used to assay for the putative activities of poliovirus 2C. Deletion mutants were constructed which lacked different portions of the 2C carboxyl terminus: mutant 2C delta 1 lacked the last 169 amino acids, whereas mutant 2C delta 2 had the last 74 amino acids deleted. The fusion proteins MBP-2C, MBP-2BC, and the mutant MBP-2C delta 2 that contained the first 255 amino acids of 2C had NTPase activity. Both ATPase and GTPase activities are inhibited by antibodies directed against the MBP-2C protein. Analysis of the ability of the different proteins to bind to labeled RNA indicates that MBP-2C and MBP-2BC form a complex, whereas none of the mutants interacted with RNA, indicating that the RNA binding domain lies beyond amino acid 255. None of the fusion proteins had detectable helicase activity. We suggest that poliovirus protein 2C shows similarities to the GTPases group involved in vesicular traffic and transports the viral RNA replication complexes. These results provide the first experimental evidence that poliovirus protein 2C is an NTPase and that this protein has affinity for nucleic acids."

https://openalex.org/W2095245627,"When inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptors are activated, calcium is released from intracellular stores in excitatory propagating waves that annihilate each other upon collision. The annihilation phenomenon suggests the presence of an underlying refractory period that controls excitability. Enhanced calcium-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity might alter the refractory period of calcium release. Expression of messenger RNA encoding the avian calcium-ATPase (SERCA1) in Xenopus laevis oocytes increased the frequency of IP3-induced calcium waves and narrowed the width of individual calcium waves. The effect of SERCA1 expression on calcium wave frequency was dependent on the concentration of IP3 and was larger at higher (1 microM) than at lower (0.1 microM) concentrations of IP3. The results demonstrate that calcium pump activity can control IP3-mediated calcium signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2052540730,"Many cell membrane receptors stimulate the phosphoinositide (PI) cycle, which produces complex intracellular calcium signals that regulate diverse processes such as secretion and transcription. A major messenger of this cycle, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), stimulates its receptor channel on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium into the cytosol. Activation of the PI cycle also induces calcium influx, which refills the intracellular calcium stores. Confocal microscopy was used to show that receptor-activated calcium influx, enhanced by hyperpolarization, modulates the frequency and velocity of IP3-dependent calcium waves in Xenopus laevis oocytes. These results demonstrate that transmembrane voltage and calcium influx pathways may regulate spatial and temporal patterns of IP3-dependent calcium release."
https://openalex.org/W1672493958,"It is well known that phosphorylation of the membrane protein phospholamban by cAMP-dependent or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase results in the activation of the Ca(2+)-pumping ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR); such enzyme activation is thought to be due to the disruption of an inhibitory interaction of non-phosphorylated phospholamban with the ATPase. We describe here a novel mechanism for the regulation of the ATPase through direct phosphorylation of this enzyme by a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) associated with the SR membrane. It is shown that incubation of cardiac SR in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin results in the phosphorylation of the ATPase in addition to the previously recognized substrates of CaM kinase, viz. phospholamban and Ca2+ channel. The phosphorylated amino acid in the ATPase has been identified as serine. Phosphorylation of the membrane-bound ATPase is stimulated by exogenous CaM kinase. Furthermore, ATPase purified from cardiac SR is phosphorylated by exogenous CaM kinase and the phosphorylated enzyme displays 2-fold increase in catalytic activity without any appreciable change in its Ca2+ sensitivity. Thus, direct phosphorylation of the Ca(2+)-pumping ATPase by CaM kinase can stimulate its enzymatic activity and, therefore, Ca2+ transport function."
https://openalex.org/W89133559,"Insulin stimulates the formation of binary and ternary signaling complexes between the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3'-kinase, IRS-1, and the insulin receptor in vivo. Binary complex formation between IRS-1 and the PtdIns 3'-kinase occurs in intact cells and requires the tyrosyl phosphorylation IRS-1, as mutant insulin receptors which weakly phosphorylate IRS-1 in vivo do not mediate formation of IRS-1/PtdIns 3'-kinase complexes in transfected CHO cells. Association with IRS-1 involves as much as 70% of total cellular PtdIns 3'-kinase activity. Insulin also stimulates the formation of ternary signaling complexes, as both IRS-1 and the PtdIns 3'-kinase are present in anti-insulin receptor immunoprecipitates from insulin-stimulated cells. Overexpression of IRS-1 in CHO cells increases the amount of PtdIns 3'-kinase activity in alpha IR immunoprecipitates, and IRS-1 markedly increases the in vitro binding of p85 alpha and PtdIns 3-kinase activity to anti-receptor immunoprecipitates. The mechanism for this association is unknown, but appears to involve the binding of IRS-1/PtdIns 3'-kinase complexes to the insulin receptor. The formation of binary and ternary complexes between the insulin receptor, IRS-1 and the PtdIns 3'-kinase may play a critical role in transmission of the insulin signal."
https://openalex.org/W1481829434,"We isolated an enzyme from a major periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis (also called Bacteroides gingivalis), that is capable of initially increasing the coagulant activity of high molecular weight kininogen (HK), releasing bradykinin from HK and low molecular weight kininogen (LK), and destroying the light chain (coagulant portion) of HK. This enzyme, a membrane-bound thiol proteinase that preferentially cleaves the P1-Lys position of tripeptide substrates, is also able to rapidly render fibrinogen nonclottable. We will refer to this enzyme as lys-gingivain because of its origin from P. gingivalis, its classification as a thiol proteinase, and its action as a lysyl-amidase. The activity of lys-gingivain is enhanced by beta-mercaptoethanol, and the enzyme has a molecular mass of 68-70 kDa, a pH optimum of 7.4, and is not inactivated by plasma protease inhibitors. The second-order rate constant for the destruction of the coagulant activity of the HK light chain (surface-binding domain) at 23 degrees C is 2.3 x 10(7) M-1 s-1, and, for cleavages that render fibrinogen unclottable, is 2.05 x 10(6) M-1 s-1. These data suggest that lys-gingivain is a very potent proteinase that would be fully functional in anaerobic periodontal crevices and might participate in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. Lys-gingivain appears to be the most potent kininogenase and fibrase to be described to date."
https://openalex.org/W1586779185,"In dog thyroid epithelial cells (thyrocytes) in primary culture, thyrotropin (TSH) acting through cAMP induces proliferation and differentiation expression, whereas epidermal growth factor (EGF) and tumor-promoting phorbol esters induce proliferation and dedifferentiation. In these cells we have demonstrated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation by 32P labeling and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and by immunodetection with anti-MAP kinase and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies after one- or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. MAP kinase localization was demonstrated by immunochemical staining. We show the following results. (i) As in other systems, EGF and phorbol esters induced p42 and p44 MAP kinases phosphorylation on tyrosine, serine, and threonine. This effect was rapid, peaking after 5 and 15 min, respectively, followed by a slow decline thereafter. It preceded a translocation of MAP kinase immunoreactivity from cytoplasm to nucleus. (ii) Carbamylcholine, a potent stimulator of the Ca(2+)-phosphatidylinositol cascade which is unable to induce DNA synthesis, stimulated MAP kinases phosphorylation and nuclear staining with kinetics similar to those observed after EGF action, indicating that MAP kinase phosphorylation was not sufficient for mitogenesis. (iii) The cAMP-dependent mitogenic cascade elicited by TSH and forskolin did not involve the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p42 and p44 MAP kinases at any time during the entire prereplicative phase. Activation of MAP kinases by phosphorylation is therefore not a necessary step in the G0-G1 transition in this mitogenic cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1527717785,"The amino acid sequence of subunit 9 of the bovine heart cytochrome bc1 complex is identical to the 78-amino acid presequence that is removed post-translationally from the Rieske iron-sulfur protein as it is imported and targeted to the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex. Iron-sulfur protein precursor, generated by in vitro transcription and translation, is processed to mature size in a single step when incubated with rat liver mitochondria, and generates a peptide that comigrates on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with subunit 9. These results suggest that the Rieske protein is processed in a single proteolytic step after it is inserted into the cytochrome bc1 complex in mammals, and that the processed presequence remains as a subunit of the complex. This is apparently the first instance in which a cleaved targeting presequence has been shown to be retained in the cell, possibly exhibiting a second function in addition to its function in protein trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W1513007967,"The activation of gelsolin by calcium has been postulated to be involved in the receptor-mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, but cytoskeletal reorganization can also occur in cells with intracellular Ca2+ clamped at nanomolar levels. Fluorescence measurements using Fura-2 show that at pH 7.4, the Ca2+ requirement for gelsolin activation in vitro is higher than previously reported, with half-maximal activation of severing and nucleation occurring at 10 microM Ca2+. The Ca2+ requirement for gelsolin activity decreases at more acid pH and is approximately 3 microM at pH 6.5. At pH below 6.0, gelsolin no longer requires Ca2+ for activity and severs actin filaments, binds two actin monomers, and nucleates filament formation in EGTA-containing solutions. The pH-activated severing activity is inhibited by mixed lipid vesicles containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. A Ca(2+)-sensitive fragment consisting of the first 135 amino acids of human cytoplasmic gelsolin also demonstrates severing activity at pH < 6.0 in the absence of Ca2+. In contrast, the gelsolin homologs severin and villin maintain Ca2+ regulation of severing activity at low pH. These differences suggest that activation of gelsolin at low pH cannot be explained merely by destabilization of F-actin. The difference in diffusion constants of gelsolin measured at pH 5.5 and 6.5, as determined by dynamic light scattering, suggests that the molecule undergoes a shape change similar to that reported upon binding Ca2+ at neutral pH. These results suggest a mechanism by which gelsolin may be activated in vivo under conditions where Ca2+ transients do not occur."
https://openalex.org/W1993889815,"A mobile endogenous transposable element, Tag1, has been identified in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Tag1 was found in the nitrate transporter gene, CHL1, of a chlorate-resistant mutant present in a population of plants containing an active maize Ac transposon. Tag1 excises from the chl1 gene producing chlorate-sensitive revertants with Tag1 or Tag1-related elements at different loci. Tag1 and related elements are present in the Landsberg but not Columbia or Wassilewskija ecotypes of Arabidopsis. Thus, Tag1 provides a tool for the insertional mutagenesis of plant genes essential for biological processes of agronomic importance."
https://openalex.org/W2043392684,"A synthetic mitochondrial presequence has been shown to translocate across pure phospholipid bilayers. The presequence was fluorescently labeled so that its association with membranes could be monitored spectroscopically. In the presence of large unilamellar vesicles, the presequence showed time- and potential-dependent protection from reaction with added trypsin and dithionite. The protection was rapidly reversed by treatment of the vesicles with detergent. If the vesicles contained trypsin, the added presequence became sensitive to digestion by the protease. The results show that a mitochondrial presequence can translocate across phospholipid bilayers that lack a hydrophilic translocation pore."
https://openalex.org/W1592451467,"Abstract We recently characterized a semirecombinant cell-free NADPH-oxidase system, comprised of plasma membrane plus the recombinant cytosolic proteins p47-phox and p67-phox, wherein superoxide generation was activated by an anionic amphiphile plus guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) (Uhlinger, D. J., Inge, K. L., Kreck, M. L., Tyagi, S. R., Neckelmann, N., and Lambeth, J. D. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 186, 509-516). Based on preincubation with guanine nucleotides, we show that plasma membrane contains G protein(s) that support oxidase activation at submaximal rates. By varying p47-phox and p67-phox concentrations, kinetic parameters (EC50 and Vmax) for each were determined. For both, GTP gamma S increased the Vmax and decreased the EC50, whereas guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S) produced the opposite effect, consistent with the participation of a G protein in an activation complex containing p47-phox and p67-phox. Using [35S]methionine-labeled p47-phox and p67-phox, we investigated the association of these components with both normal plasma membranes and chronic granulomatous disease membranes lacking cytochrome b558. p47-phox translocation was stimulated by arachidonate but not GTP gamma S, was about 50% cytochrome-dependent, and occurred independently of p67-phox. Arachidonate-stimulated translocation of p67-phox required both cytochrome and p47-phox and was enhanced by GTP gamma S. The mass of p47-phox and p67-phox which assembled with cytochrome b558 indicated a ternary complex with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry."
https://openalex.org/W1551004756,"The active site Fe3+ of protocatechuate (PCA) 3,4-dioxygenase can be nonenzymatically reduced to Fe2+, to give a colorless and EPR-silent enzyme (Er). Nitric oxide (NO) binds to Er to yield a species with EPR (S = 3/2; g = 4.341, 3.693, 1.984; E/D = 0.055) and optical absorption (lambda max = 430 nm, epsilon approximately 1870 M-1 cm-1/iron) spectra. Addition of NO to a preformed Er. PCA complex results in a new species (EPR: S = 3/2; g = 4.920, 2.988, 1.846; E/D = 0.175; optical: lambda max = 404 nm, epsilon approximately 3930 M-1 cm-1/iron). Hyperfine broadening from the substrates [17O]PCA or [17O]homoprotocatechuate (HPCA) is observed in the EPR spectra of Er.substrate.NO complexes only when the 17O (I = 5/2) is placed in the carbon-4 OH group, suggesting that only this group binds to the iron when NO is bound. Previous studies (Orville, A. M., and Lipscomb, J. D. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 8791-8801) showed that both OH groups of HPCA can bind to the Fe3+ of the oxidized enzyme. Thus, the NO may compete with the substrate carbon-3 OH group for a binding site on the Fe2+. In contrast, when either PCA or HPCA is added to a preformed Er.NO complex, no substrate binding to the Fe2+ is detected. At 2.3 K, white light photodissociates NO from the Er.NO and Er.PCA.NO complexes. The Er.NO complex is photodissociated to a greater extent than the Er.PCA.NO complex, and different NO rebinding kinetics are observed showing that the substrate strongly influences the photodissociation/reassociation process. Photodissociation of each complex results in the formation of some Fe3+, suggesting that the nitrosyl complex has at least partial Fe(3+)-NO- character. In solution at 5-10 degrees C, white light promotes conversion of preformed Er.NO plus PCA to the Er.PCA.NO complex, suggesting that formation of the latter complex requires dissociation of NO. It is proposed that initial NO binding blocks the single site for exogenous ligand binding on the iron, thereby inhibiting PCA association. In contrast, PCA binding before NO appears to evoke an enzyme conformational change that allows simultaneous NO binding in another ligand site. These results are consistent with the current model for the mechanism of intradiol dioxygenases in which a PCA-induced conformational change allows substrate to bind as an Fe3+ chelate and O2 reacts initially with the PCA rather than the Fe3+."
https://openalex.org/W1487284886,"Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and angiotensin II (AII) are peptides that regulate the production of steroid hormones by cells of the adrenal cortex. The cellular mechanisms linking these peptides to corticosteroid hormone secretion are not understood. In patch clamp recordings from bovine adrenal zona fasciculata (AZF) cells, we have identified a novel cholera toxin-sensitive K+ current (IAC), which is potently inhibited by both ACTH and AII with respective EC50 values of 4.5 and 145 pM. These two peptides depolarize AZF cells with a temporal pattern and potency that parallels the inhibition of IAC. With the discovery of IAC, we have identified a common molecular target for both ACTH and AII. The convergent inhibition of IAC by these two peptides suggests a mechanism whereby biochemical signals originating at the cell membrane can be transduced to depolarization-dependent Ca2+ entry and steroid hormone secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1520769529,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a G protein-linked signal transduction pathway mediates response to the oligopeptide mating pheromones a-factor and alpha-factor. Because cellular responses, including G1 arrest, occur transiently, cells can adapt or desensitize and resume growth. To address whether the balance between response and adaptation is influenced by the efficiency of receptor-G protein interaction, we introduced random point mutations in sequences that encode the third cytoplasmic loop of the alpha-factor receptor (STE2 gene product). Three mutations were identified that confer alpha-factor-resistant phenotypes, yet preserve normal cell-surface expression, ligand-binding affinity, and endocytosis of the receptor. However, these mutations confer partial signaling defects, as determined by cell cycle arrest and transcriptional induction assays, as well as in vitro assays of receptor-G protein interaction. Physiological tests suggested that receptors bearing third loop substitutions promote recovery from pheromone-induced growth arrest. Genetic evidence indicated that the third loop and the C-terminal domain of the receptor control independent recovery or adaptation processes. In contrast, receptor third loop substitutions caused rapid adaptation only if cells express a functional SST2 gene. Thus, disruption of pheromone receptor-G protein interaction concomitantly blunts signaling and specifically promotes the function of an SST2-dependent adaptation pathway. Possible functions for the Sst2 protein are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1596877171,"The present study was undertaken to determine whether specific interactions between cAMP and glucocorticoids regulate apoptosis in thymocytes. Incubation of murine thymocytes with agents that elevate the cAMP level resulted in enhancement of glucocorticoid-induced Ca2+ increases, DNA fragmentation, and cell death compared to levels observed in thymocytes treated with steroid alone. cAMP did not affect DNA fragmentation in thymocytes treated with Ca2+ ionophore, a compound that induces endonuclease activation via an independent mechanism. Treatment with cAMP also increased glucocorticoid potency by lowering the concentration of steroid required for induction of apoptosis. The mechanism of cAMP action appeared to involve the glucocorticoid receptor, since the glucocorticoid antagonist RU-486 abrogated the cAMP response in animals treated with the adenosine analog NECA in vivo. Analysis of cellular glucocorticoid binding and receptor protein levels revealed modest cAMP-stimulated increases that appeared insufficient to account for the effects of cAMP on endogenous endonuclease activation, suggesting the possible involvement of a posttranslational mechanism in the response. These results demonstrate that cAMP and glucocorticoids synergize to promote apoptosis in thymocytes via a mechanism that appears to involve modification of glucocorticoid receptor activity."
https://openalex.org/W1602447595,"The effects of activation of cAMP- and protein kinase C-dependent signal transduction pathways were investigated on intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), cAMP content and insulin secretion from beta-cells purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting from normal rat islets. The secretion of insulin from suspensions of purified beta-cells was dependent on glucose concentration and hormonal signals, including cAMP and activators of protein kinase C. Microfluorimetric measurement of [Ca2+]i with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2 indicated that beta-cells differed immensely in their individual responsiveness to glucose stimulation. An increase in [Ca2+]i occurred in approximately 70% of beta-cells, whereas approximately 30% of beta-cells were nonresponsive to a glucose stimulus. Elevation of cAMP levels by theophylline or glucagon transformed nonresponsive beta-cells into cells which displayed marked increases in [Ca2+]i, and beta-cells which exhibited glucose-induced changes in [Ca2+]i showed further increases in [Ca2+]i and in the amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations. Carbachol and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, activators of protein kinase C, did not induce any alterations in intracellular cAMP levels; nonetheless, these agents increased both the number of beta-cells which exhibited glucose-induced changes in [Ca2+]i and the amplitude of oscillations. The ability of cAMP or activators of protein kinase C to increase [Ca2+]i in single beta-cells was directly correlated with the ability of beta-cell suspensions to secrete insulin in response to a glucose stimulus. These results suggest that both cAMP- and protein kinase C-dependent pathways may regulate Ca2+ entry into beta-cells, possibly via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Thus, this may represent a common mechanism whereby these different signal transduction pathways potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion from beta-cells."
https://openalex.org/W1600414952,"The regulation of cGMP phosphodiesterase in vertebrate rod photoreceptors is a typical G protein-dependent signal transduction mechanism. The interaction of P gamma, an inhibitory subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase, with transducin alpha subunit (T alpha) is essential for the activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase. It has been shown that, in a homogenized preparation of frog (Rana catesbeiana) rods, P gamma interacts with GTP.T alpha and remains tightly bound to GDP.T alpha after GTP hydrolysis on T alpha. Association of this complex with beta gamma subunits of transducin (T beta gamma) triggers the release of P gamma from the complex and the subsequent inactivation of cGMP phosphodiesterase. In a system reconstituted with purified components, both GTP- and GDP-bound forms of T alpha were found to interact with P gamma. Under these conditions, P gamma inhibited GTP hydrolysis by transducin in a noncompetitive manner with a Ki of 92 nM. Binding of an hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog to T alpha was also inhibited by P gamma. These inhibitions of transducin function were resulted from the inhibition of both hydrolysis of GTP bound to T alpha and interaction of GDP.T alpha with membrane-bound T beta gamma. However, after GDP.T alpha reassociated with membrane-bound T beta gamma, the inhibitory effect of P gamma on the binding of an hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog to T alpha was greatly diminished, suggesting that the GTP/GDP exchange on T alpha was not inhibited by P gamma. These data indicate that the T alpha function is altered during complexing with P gamma. G protein functions may be modified by interacting with an effector in the G protein-dependent signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1563567580,"The presynaptic filament is an obligatory intermediate in general genetic recombination. It is composed of a strand transferase protein polymerized along single-stranded DNA. In bacteriophage T4-infected cells, the presynaptic filament is composed of at least three proteins. In addition to the strand transferase (the uvsX protein), the uvsY (an accessory factor), and gene 32 (a helix-destabilizing factor), proteins also bind to the single-stranded DNA. In this report, we probe the assembly of the T4 presynaptic filament and the organization of the proteins in the complex. We find that interactions between the uvsY protein and the C terminus of the gene 32 protein are required to load UvsY onto gene 32 protein-covered DNA. Efficient binding of the uvsY protein to DNA is shown to be necessary for subsequent loading of the uvsX protein."
https://openalex.org/W1491551729,"cAMP induced rapid apoptosis (> 90% cell death in 6 h) of non-growth-arrested rat leukemia IPC-81 cells. A cell clone selected for cAMP resistance had a normally functioning apoptotic machinery whose triggering required about 30-fold higher cellular cAMP than in the parent cells. The cAMP subresponsiveness was due to a heterozygous point mutation (Ala336-->Asp) in the RI subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase I. In fact, apoptosis correlated with intracellular cAMP binding to the subresponsive RI. The mutated alanine is invariantly present in cyclic nucleotide kinases, but of unknown function. The mutation decreased the cAMP affinity to site B by increasing the cAMP dissociation rate 500x. The ability of site B to discriminate adenine-modified cAMP analogues was affected, suggesting that Ala336 faced the adenine moiety of cAMP. That the heterozygously expressed RID336 was a dominant suppressor of apoptosis was explained by a higher expression of R than C subunits in the mutant cells by preferential expression of the mutant form of RI, and by the ability of mutant RI to exert dominant negative control of activation of wild type cAMP kinase at moderate cAMP levels. Apoptosis was induced at a similar cAMP level in cells treated with cholera toxin or other cAMP elevating agents, indicating that cAMP kinase was essential for toxin action."
https://openalex.org/W1601641487,"The heme coordination of ovine prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS) has been characterized by EPR, magnetic circular dichroism, resonance Raman, and optical spectroscopies. The EPR spectrum of ferric PGHS is consistent with an equilibrium mixture of high-spin and low-spin heme species. Both species disappear on reaction of the synthase with hydroperoxides. The high-spin to low-spin interconversion is temperature- and concentration-dependent. Correlation between the axial and rhombic ligand fields of the low-spin heme species suggests that it has bishistidine axial ligation. Magnetic circular dichroism spectra of PGHS also show a temperature-dependent spin transition. Resonance Raman spectra indicate that the enzyme exists as a mixture of six-coordinate low-spin and six-coordinate high-spin ferric heme species. No Raman bands attributable to five-coordinate high-spin heme species are detectable. The magnetic circular dichroism spectra of the fluoride, azide, cyanide, and imidazole derivatives of PGHS resemble those of the corresponding metmyoglobin derivatives and are very different from those of the catalase derivatives. EPR spectra of the imidazole derivative of these three proteins provide additional evidence that the heme coordination structure of PGHS is similar to that of metmyoglobin rather than that of catalase. The midpoint potential of the PGHS Fe(III)/Fe(II) pair is in the range observed for hemeproteins with mono- or bishistidine coordination. These data provide a convincing case that the axial heme ligands of PGHS-1 are a pair of histidine residues, with the distal histidine weakly associated and possibly exchangeable with a weak-field ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1607628201,"The neurohormone serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) triggers meiosis reinitiation in prophase-arrested oocytes of Spisula solidissima. The original pharmacological profile of this response prompted us to examine whether it involved a novel type of 5HT receptor. In order to characterize these putative receptors, we performed [3H]5HT binding assays. Given the complexity of oocyte surface architecture, [3H]5HT-specific binding was measured in both plasma membrane and vitelline envelope fractions. Our data reveal the existence of a single class of 5HT-specific binding sites in each fraction. These binding sites appear distinct by their kinetic properties: 1) plasma membrane binding sites are of lower affinity but are more numerous than vitelline envelope sites; 2) [3H]5HT binding is more rapid in membrane fraction. The pharmacological profiles of both binding sites were defined in competition experiments by using sixteen 5HT-related and unrelated compounds. Both membrane and vitelline envelope sites displayed novel profiles. However, only the pharmacological profile determined for the plasma membrane sites corresponds to that observed for 5HT-induced meiosis reinitiation. These new 5HT5 binding sites are therefore the physiological receptors that mediate the effects of 5HT in Spisula oocytes. The putative role of vitelline envelope sites is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2413501356,"Genes encoding the m1 muscarinic (m1 mAChR) and beta 2-adrenergic receptors (beta 2AR) were stably co-expressed into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to study receptor regulation and cross-talk. Persistent activation of the beta 2AR/adenylate cyclase pathway by isoproterenol leads to heterologous desensitization, internalization, and down-regulation of the m1 mAChR which is comparable, but smaller in magnitude, with that seen with persistent activation of the m1 mAChR by carbachol. This heterologous effect was mimicked by dibutyryl cAMP and forskolin and antagonized by the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-8. A potential consensus sequence for phosphorylation by PKA (Lys351-Arg-Lys-Thr354) exists on the third intracellular loop of the m1 mAChR, suggesting that receptor phosphorylation by PKA may be involved in heterologous regulation. The loss of m1 mAChRs induced by carbachol was not reversed by H-8, indicating that homologous regulation is not dependent on PKA. Recent evidence suggests that muscarinic agonist-mediated internalization of the m1 mAChR involves the third intracellular loop (i3) (Maeda, S., Lameh, J., Mallet, W. G., Philip, M., Ramachandran, J., and Sadee, W. (1990) FEBS Lett. 269, 386-388). Three deletion mutant receptors were constructed in which the majority, or small regions, of i3 were eliminated but the membrane proximal portions of the loop were left intact. Each of the mutants was co-expressed with the beta 2AR in CHO cells. A small region in i3 was identified which is crucial for carbachol- and isoproterenol-promoted internalization and down-regulation. This region contains a series of 6 serine residues within an 8-amino acid stretch. A similar domain has been identified in the carboxyl tail of the beta 2AR and has been proposed to participate in receptor internalization (Hausdorff, W. P., Campbell, P. T., Ostrowski, J., Yu, S. S., Caron, M. G., and Lefkowitz, R. J. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 2979-2983)."
https://openalex.org/W1606519767,"86Rb+ binding to the H,K-ATPase was measured in the Mg(2+)-vanadate-inhibited enzyme at 4 degrees C. The concentration dependence of 86Rb+ binding in detergent-free preparations exhibited two components, one saturable with a K0.5 (Rb+) of 0.76 +/- 0.3 mM and a binding capacity of 2626 +/- 690 pmol of Rb+/mg of protein and the second nonsaturable, but linearly dependent, upon the 86Rb+ concentration. The concentration dependence of 86Rb+ binding was unaffected by digitonin treatment with a K0.5 (Rb+) of 0.63 +/- 0.09 mM and a binding capacity of 2824 +/- 152 pmol of Rb+/mg of protein, but the amplitude of the nonsaturable component was eliminated. The level of 86Rb+ binding was optimized by vanadate and decreased by ADP and ATP, suggesting that cation binding is stabilized in the E2-like conformation and antagonized in the E1 conformation. The Rb(+)-dependent stabilization of the E2 enzyme conformation was confirmed from the fluorescent quench response of the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled enzyme, where 86Rb+ bound to the FITC-labeled enzyme with a K0.5 = 0.85 +/- 0.3 mM and a saturable binding capacity of 2121 pmol of 86Rb+/mg of protein and quenched the FITC fluorescence with a K0.5(Rb+) of 3.6 +/- 0.3 mM. The K(+)-competitive inhibitor, 1-(2-methylphenyl)-4-methylamino-6-methyl-2,3-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-c ]quinoline (MDPQ), also quenched FITC fluorescence with a K0.5(MDPQ) of 24.5 +/- 0.6 microM and competitively inhibited 86Rb+ binding with a K*0.5 = 35.8 microM (MDPQ). The MDPQ-induced quench of FITC fluorescence at Lys517 within the cytoplasmic M4/M5 nucleotide domain and displacement of 86Rb+ from a functionally defined extracytoplasmic binding domain indicate that structural determinants of the E2 conformational state exist within both cytoplasmic and extracytoplasmic domains of the H,K-ATPase and thus provide evidence of concerted conformational changes between the nucleotide and cation binding domains within the FITC-labeled H,K-ATPase. Membrane-bound fragments of the H,K-ATPase were prepared by tryptic hydrolysis in KCl medium. Tryptic digestion rapidly inactivated the phosphoenzyme site with a time course where k = 0.25 +/- 0.04 min-1 but both 86Rb+ binding and MDPQ fluorescence responses were retained. The concentration dependence of 86Rb+ binding and Rb(+)-dependent MDPQ fluorescence responses in the trypsin-digested membranes were described by a single class of binding sites where K0.5 = 1.2 +/- 0.3 and 0.73 +/- 0.09 mM, respectively. The stability of the Rb+ and MDPQ sites suggest their locations are near or within the membrane and are inaccessible to trypsin attack.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1606971937,"The Na+/H+ antiporter of trout erythrocytes is activated by agents raising intracellular cAMP, whereas other Na+/H+ exchangers are insensitive to or inhibited by cAMP. Cloning of the beta agonist-activated exchanger (beta NHE) reveals the presence of two consensus sites for phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA) on the cytoplasmic loop. Transfected to fibroblasts, beta NHE can no longer be activated by cAMP when these consensus sites are removed, indicating regulation through cAMP-PKA. Moreover, it has been shown that activation of the exchanger is rapidly followed by its desensitization. To further investigate the role of phosphorylation in these processes, we examined the effects of protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors on the antiporter activation and desensitization in trout red cells. Na+/H+ exchange was not induced by strong acidification, indicating that beta NHE is normally in a nonfunctional state, whereas cAMP did activate the system by forcing beta NHE into a functional conformation; preincubation of cells with the kinase inhibitor H89 blocked cAMP-activation, confirming the role of cAMP-PKA in the activation process. The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) neither activated the exchange when added on unstimulated cells nor prevented deactivation of beta agonist-activated beta NHE by propranolol. Hence, the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation involved in the activating process is controlled by an OA-insensitive phosphatase. beta NHE activated by beta agonist or cAMP shifts rapidly into a refractory state, accounting for the previously described desensitization. Desensitization was blocked and reversed by OA, indicating a control by an OA-sensitive phosphatase of the phosphorylation level of a site critical for the desensitizing process. Phosphorylation of this (site 2) and of the activating site (site 1) is mediated by cAMP-PKA, as demonstrated by the effects of both intracellular cAMP concentration and kinase inhibitor H89 on the Na+/H+ exchange activity. Based on these data, we proposed that beta NHE can exist in three different states (inactive I, activated A, and desensitized D). Conversion of I to A needs the simultaneous phosphorylation by cAMP-PKA of sites 1 and 2. These two sites might constitute the two neighboring cAMP-PKA sites located on the cytoplasmic loop as deduced from the oligonucleotide sequence. Dephosphorylation of site 2 and subsequent binding of an arrestin-like protein are assumed to account for desensitization of the antiport.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1597102216,"We developed a novel method for immunoaffinity purification of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAB) receptor from bovine cerebral cortex using a monoclonal antibody, which specifically recognizes an 80-kDa GABA-binding protein (Nakayasu, H., Mizutani, H., Hanai, K., Kimura, H., and Kuriyama, K. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 182, 722-726). The GABA binding activity in the solubilized synaptic membrane preparation was adsorbed on the antibody-conjugated beads and was eluted as a single protein band of 80 kDa by an acidic buffer, pH 2.5. The purified preparation mimicked the GABAB receptor in its binding activity for GABA, baclofen (GABAB receptor agonist) and 2-hydroxysaclofen (a GABAB receptor antagonist). The purified preparation was reconstituted with partially purified GTP-binding protein and an adenylylcyclase preparation on a phospholipid membrane. On addition of GABA or baclofen to the reconstituted membrane, the adenylylcyclase activity was inhibited, and this inhibition was antagonized by 2-hydroxysaclofen. Moreover, this inhibition by GABA was not observed in a system reconstituted system without either the 80-kDa GABA-binding protein or the GTP-binding protein. These results are strong evidence that the 80-kDa antigenic protein is the GABAB receptor. This is the first report of the nearly complete purification of the GABAB receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1533787313,"Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase (AC) toxin has the abilities to 1) enter target cells where it catalyzes cyclic AMP production and 2) lyse sheep erythrocytes, and these abilities require post-translational modification by the product of an accessory gene cyaC (Barry, E. M., Weiss, A. A., Ehrmann, E. E., Gray, M. C., Hewlett, E. L., and Goodwin, M. St. M. (1991) J. Bacteriol. 173, 720-726). In the present study, AC toxin has been purified from an organism with a mutation in cyaC, BPDE386, and evaluated for its physical and functional properties in order to determine the basis for its lack of toxin and hemolytic activities. AC toxin from BPDE386 is indistinguishable from wild-type toxin in enzymatic activity, migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ability to bind calcium, and calcium-dependent conformational change. Although unable to elicit cAMP accumulation, AC toxin from BPDE386 exhibits binding to the surface of Jurkat cells which is comparable to that of wild-type toxin. This target cell interaction is qualitatively different, however, in that 99% of the mutant toxin remains sensitive to trypsin, whereas approximately 20% of cell-associated wild-type toxin enters a trypsin-resistant compartment. To evaluate the ability of this mutant AC toxin to function at its intracellular site of action, the cAMP-stimulated L-type calcium current in frog atrial myocytes was used. Extracellular addition of wild-type toxin results in cAMP-dependent events that include activation of calcium channels and enhancement of calcium current. In contrast, there is no response to externally applied toxin from BPDE386. When injected into the cell interior, however, the AC toxin from BPDE386 is able to produce increases in the calcium current comparable to those observed with wild-type toxin. Although AC toxin from BPDE386 is unaffected in its enzymatic activity, calcium binding, and calcium-dependent conformational change, the mutation in cyaC does result in a toxin which is able to bind to target cells but unable to elicit cAMP accumulation. In that AC toxin from BPDE386 is able to function normally when injected artificially to an intracellular site, we conclude that the disruption of cyaC produces a defect in insertion and transmembrane delivery of the catalytic domain."
https://openalex.org/W1923325553,"Abstract Ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2s) are an integral part of a multienzyme pathway that ligates ubiquitin to intracellular target proteins. This ligation has been implicated in a number of fundamental processes including protein degradation, cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and organelle biogenesis. To function, E2s form a labile thiol-ester intermediate between a specific cysteine within the E2 and the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin; this high energy intermediate then serves as the donor for ubiquitin ligation. To aid in the characterization of E2s, we have created a stable ubiquitin-E2 intermediate using a mutant form of the 16-kDa E2 encoded by the Arabidopsis thaliana AtUBC1 gene in which the active-site cysteine at residue 88 was replaced with serine. The mutant protein synthesized in Escherichia coli formed an adduct with ubiquitin in vitro, but in this case the E2 and ubiquitin were linked via a more stable ester bond. The ester-linked ubiquitin could not be transferred subsequently to substrate proteins in an E3 alpha-dependent conjugation reaction. The ester adduct was sufficiently stable to survive purification by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography. As a result, this adduct may prove useful for the structural analysis of ubiquitin-E2 intermediates and in the study of E2s interacting with other ubiquitin pathway enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1519063739,"Cyclins are key regulatory proteins that, in concert with cyclin-dependent protein kinase subunits (cdks), function to govern critical transitions and/or restriction points during the course of cell cycle progression. Recently, a number of putative mammalian G1 cyclins have been characterized at the molecular level; however, the specific activities of the cyclin/cdk complexes and the precise biochemical pathways regulated by the G1 cyclins remain to be elucidated. In the present study we identify a novel cyclin-like protein in pediatric bone and extremity tumors that appears to be related to, but is clearly distinct from, previously identified members of the cyclin D family, as determined by its profile of antibody cross-reactivity, apparent molecular size, chromatographic behavior, physicochemical properties, and pattern of peptide mapping. This 46-kDa cyclin-like protein, tentatively designated p46cyclin X, is first expressed in synchronized MG-63 osteosarcoma cells in mid-G1, well after the induction of p36cyclin D1, yet prior to the induction of cyclins E and A. Northern analysis, utilizing an oligonucleotide probe complementary to an epitope shared by cyclins D1, D2, and X, detected a novel mRNA species, the appearance of which correlates with p46cyclin X expression. The p46cyclin X protein in Ewing's sarcomas and Wilms' tumors is electrophoretically and chromatographically distinct from both p36cyclin D1 and p34cyclin D2. Moreover, the p46cyclin X protein is 1) precipitated by p9Ckshs1-agarose beads, 2) physically associated with p33cdk2, and 3) autophosphorylated in in vitro kinase reactions. Taken together with the biochemical data, the temporal expression of the p46cyclin X/p33cdk2 kinase system is suggestive of a potential role in regulating latter G1 events (i.e. START) in the commitment to S phase."
https://openalex.org/W1544386102,"Previous studies have shown that a human insulin receptor lacking the COOH-terminal 43-amino acid domain (HIR delta CT) displays a compromised ability to stimulate glucose transport and glycogen synthase, whereas mitogenic signaling and stimulation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity remain intact (Maegawa, H., McClain, D. A., Freidenberg, G., Olefsky, J. M., Napier, M., Lipari, T., Dull, T. J., Lee, J., and Ullrich, A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8912-8917). In this study, we examined the effect of insulin on protein phosphatase 1 (PP-1) activity and phosphorylation in cells expressing wild-type human insulin receptor (HIRc) and HIR delta CT cells using phosphorylase alpha as substrate in the presence of 3 nM okadaic acid. Basal PP-1 activity was significantly lower in HIR delta CT than in HIRc cells (p < 0.05). Insulin stimulated PP-1 activity in HIRc cells (25-30% increase over basal activity) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Insulin failed to stimulate PP-1 activity in HIR delta CT cells. Western blotting with the catalytic subunit antibody and the regulatory subunit antibody revealed similar amounts of the 37-kDa band (catalytic subunit) and the 160-kDa band (presumed regulatory subunit) in HIRc and HIR delta CT cells. We conclude that the COOH-terminal domain of the insulin receptor is an important element in mediating the effect of insulin on PP-1 and suggest that activation of PP-1 may be linked to signaling insulin's metabolic actions."
https://openalex.org/W1481212092,"Chronic reduction of Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity has been demonstrated in a number of cell systems to elicit a cellular homeostatic response. Over the course of this response, there is initially a transient stimulation of synthesis of new Na+/K(+)-ATPase molecules, followed by a delayed decrease in its degradation rate, eliciting an effective increase in the number of active pumps in the membrane. The resultant enhancement of pumping capacity promotes the extrusion of accumulated Na+ ions and restores the intracellular electrolyte milieu to preinsult conditions. No cellular mediators of either component of this response have previously been described. We therefore tested the possibility that changes in [Ca2+]i might contribute to the transient stimulation of synthesis observed. Indeed, an effective synthetic response to the inhibition of Na+/K(+)-ATPase by treatment with ouabain required elevated [Ca2+]i levels."

The unfolding and dissociation of the dimeric enzyme (58 kDa) by guanidine hydrochloride have been investigated at equilibrium. The overall process was reversible as judged from the complete recovery of catalytic activity after dilution of guanidine hydrochloride-treated samples. Unfolding of myo-inositol monophosphatase was monitored by circular dichroism, fluorescence, and steady state emission anisotropy. A folded, monomeric form of the monophosphatase was not detected by the method of denaturant gel filtration. Uncoupled dissociation and unfolding of the oligomeric enzyme could not be demonstrated. The circular dichroism and emission anisotropy results are consistent with a model in which the dimeric protein unfolds in a single cooperative transition from folded dimer to two unfolded monomers."
https://openalex.org/W1608645237,"Nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide analogues were used to evaluate the role of guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins in regulating pepsinogen secretion from streptolysin O-permeabilized chief cells from guinea pig stomach. In the presence of 100 nM calcium, 100 microM guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate or guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) caused a 2- to 4-fold increase in pepsinogen secretion. GTP gamma S stimulated secretion in the absence of calcium (up to 10 mM EGTA). With or without added calcium, GTP analogues caused a 2- to 3-fold increase in cAMP, whereas guanosine 5'-O-2-(thio)diphosphate and calcium alone had no effect on cAMP levels. GTP analogue-induced activation of phospholipase C was evidenced by a calcium-independent increase in cytidine diphospho-1,2-diacylglycerol levels (50% above basal). Phorbol ester- and GTP gamma S-stimulated phosphorylation of a 72-kDa acidic protein was abolished by an inhibitor of protein kinase C (CGP 41251). However, GTP gamma S-induced pepsinogen secretion was only partially inhibited by adding CGP 41251 or a protein kinase C inhibitor peptide. These results indicate that guanine nucleotides activate major signaling pathways in gastric chief cells. Nevertheless, GTP gamma S can induce pepsinogen secretion independently of changes in calcium, cAMP, or activation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1492437584,"Endonuclease II of coliphage T4 is necessary for the in vivo restriction of plasmid DNA in phage-infected cells. Double-stranded restriction cleavage at 12 sites in pBR322 commenced before 10-min postinfection with T4 at 37 degrees C and proceeded more slowly in the presence of competing phage DNA than in its absence, utilizing the same sites in both cases; in a 200-base pair segment of the plasmid, single-stranded nicks also were frequent. The plasmid sites were cleaved with a speed that varied with the site, yielding frequencies of cleavage at different sites varying between 10 and 90%, at 50-min postinfection. All sites contained good matches to a consensus, 5'-GRCCGCNTYGC-3', most frequently cleaved around the variable central base pair, generating fragments with blunt ends or 1-2-base 5' overhangs. Using the frequency of cleavage to determine a weighted consensus, a larger sequence, 5'-CGRCCGCNTTGSYNGC-3', was identified. Thus, DNA sequence elements 3' to the cut site appear important for rapid cleavage. Several models describing the sequence-dependent structure of DNA suggest structural anomalies around the cleavage sites. The endonuclease II restriction system is most similar to type II systems, although it differs from known type II systems in several respects."
https://openalex.org/W58638727,"Specific binding of the radioactive amiloride analogues [3H]phenamil and [3H]benzamil was studied in plasma membrane from chicken lower intestine. A single population of sites whose affinities and specificities towards pyrazinecarboxamides roughly resemble those of the epithelial Na+ channel, was identified. However, a matched comparison of pyrazinecarboxamide binding and Na+ transport inhibition revealed substantial differences between the high-affinity [3H]phenamil-binding site detected, and the site whose occupancy by phenamil blocks Na+ transport. First, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride was found to displace bound [3H]phenamil at concentrations that are at least 10-fold lower than those needed to block the channel. Second, the rates at which [3H]phenamil associates and dissociates from this site are lower than the rates at which Na+ channels are inhibited and reactivated, under similar conditions. A site with high affinity to both amiloride and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride was detected also in membranes from other epithelia. We conclude that tight epithelia contain a major high-affinity amiloride receptor other than the Na(+)-conducting channel, the Na+/H+ antiport or the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. This site could be associated with a pool of nonconducting channels, another (but structurally related) channel, or a totally unrelated protein."

Activity followed first order kinetics with respect to EDTA concentration. The reductive activity observed with LiPH2 using iodide as the mediator was comparable to that obtained using a variety of other free radical mediators such as veratryl alcohol, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, and 1,2,3- and 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene. EDTA-derived radicals were detected by ESR spin trapping upon incubation of LiPH2 with H2O2, iodide, and EDTA. Reduction activity was also observed using other peroxidases such as lactoperoxidase, horseradish peroxidase, and myeloperoxidase. For the reduction activity of LiPH2, it is proposed that the oxidation of EDTA is mediated by the iodide radical, and the reduction of various electron acceptors is mediated by EDTA radicals. The inhibition of reduction activity at higher concentrations of iodide might be due to the combination of iodide radicals to form I2 which forms a stable triiodide complex by reacting with excess iodide."
https://openalex.org/W1508387229,"Human liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase is 96% identical to the rat and bovine liver enzymes, and all of the critical catalytic and substrate binding residues in both the kinase and bisphosphatase domains are conserved in the three enzymes. However, in contrast to rat liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, which is readily expressed in an Escherichia coli T-7 RNA polymerase-based expression system, the human liver bifunctional enzyme could not be expressed in this system. Western blot and slot blot analysis revealed that although both the bifunctional enzyme protein and its mRNA were rapidly induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside, the protein underwent rapid degradation. Deletion of the N-2 proline residue or its mutation to arginine, the corresponding residue in the rat liver enzyme, revealed that this proline residue was responsible for its rapid degradation. The Pro-2-->Arg mutant could be expressed with a high yield (20 mg/liter) in E. coli. The results support the hypothesis that a proline residue at N-2 facilitates bifunctional enzyme degradation in E. coli. The E. coli expressed mutant form was purified to homogeneity by phosphocellulose chromatography, and its kinetic properties were compared with those of the rat liver enzyme. The kinetic properties of the two enzymes were identical except for the presence of substrate (fructose 6-phosphate) inhibition of the human liver enzyme but not of the rat liver enzyme. The ability to express and purify large amounts of human liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase will permit structure/function and x-ray crystal structure studies of the enzyme and ultimately its targeting for drug therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1596128348,"A molecule of myosin subfragment 1 (S1) from skeletal muscle has one reactive lysine residue (RLR) that is rapidly and stoichiometrically modified by trinitrobenzene sulfonate (TNBS). Previous studies on the RLR modification with TNBS in the presence of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) by others suggested the non-identical nature of the two myosin heads which is still controversial. To resolve this issue, we studied the effects of PPi and ADP on the trinitrophenylation reaction over a wide range of ligands more systematically, by using S1 containing the alkali 1 light chain. We herein show that MgPPi or MgADP reduces the maximum number of trinitrophenylated RLRs down to about 0.5 mol/mol of S1 and that this half-stoichiometric modification of RLRs is not the result of heterogeneity in the primary structure of S1. Instead, our results suggest the existence of two almost equimolar, different conformations of S1.PPi and S1.ADP. Furthermore, we show evidence that the two different conformations are in a slow equilibrium in the presence of TNBS. We also studied the effects of the stoichiometric and half-stoichiometric RLR modification on the EDTA- and Mg-ATPase activities of S1 and found no evidence for the functional heterogeneity of the myosin active site."
