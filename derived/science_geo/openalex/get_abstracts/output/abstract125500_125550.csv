In order to direct action to objects, the identity and location of those objects must somehow be integrated. To examine whether this process occurs within the prefrontal (PF) cortex, the activity of 195 PF neurons was recorded during a task that engaged both what and where working memory. Some neurons showed either object-tuned (what) or location-tuned (where) delay activity. However, over half (52 percent, or 64/123) of the PF neurons with delay activity showed both what and where tuning. These neurons may contribute to the linking of object information with the spatial information needed to guide behavior."

In the charge-separated D + Q A Q B − state (where D is the primary electron donor (a bacteriochlorophyll dimer), and Q A and Q B are the primary and secondary quinone acceptors, respectively), Q B − is located approximately 5 angstroms from the Q B position in the charge-neutral (DQ A Q B ) state, and has undergone a 180° propeller twist around the isoprene chain. A model based on the difference between the two structures is proposed to explain the observed kinetics of electron transfer from Q A − Q B to Q A Q B − and the relative binding affinities of the different ubiquinone species in the Q B pocket. In addition, several water channels (putative proton pathways) leading from the Q B pocket to the surface of the RC were delineated, one of which leads directly to the membrane surface."

Gene regulatory relationships defined in the fruit fly Drosophila suggest that overproduction of Sonic hedgehog (SHH), the ligand for PTC, will mimic loss of ptc function. It is shown here that transgenic mice overexpressing SHH in the skin develop many features of basal cell nevus syndrome, demonstrating that SHH is sufficient to induce basal cell carcinomas in mice. These data suggest that SHH may have a role in human tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1970834072,"The protooncogene Bcl-2 functions as a suppressor of apoptosis in growth factor-dependent cells, but a post-receptor signaling mechanism is not known. We recently reported that interleukin 3 (IL-3) and erythropoietin, or the protein kinase C activator bryostatin-1 (Bryo), not only suppresses apoptosis but also stimulates the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 (May, W. S., Tyler, P. G., Ito, T., Armstrong, D. K., Qatsha, K. A., and Davidson, N. E. (1994)J. Biol. Chem. 269, 26865–26870). To test whether phosphorylation is required for Bcl-2 function, conservative serine → alanine mutations were produced at the seven putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites in Bcl-2. Results indicate that the S70A Bcl-2 mutant fails to be phosphorylated after IL-3 or Bryo stimulation and is unable to support prolonged cell survival either upon IL-3 deprivation or etoposide treatment when compared with wild-type Bcl-2. In contrast, a Ser → Glu mutant, S70E, which may mimic a potential phosphate charge, more potently suppressed the etoposide-induced apoptosis than wild type in the absence of IL-3. Since the loss of function S70A mutant can heterodimerize with its partner protein and death effector Bax, these findings demonstrate that Bcl-2:Bax heterodimerization is not sufficient and Bcl-2 phosphorylation is required for full Bcl-2 death suppressor signaling activity."

For this purpose, we have selected potent 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl antisense oligonucleotides (IC50 = 2 and 6 nm) that target the 5′ cap region of the human intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) transcript to determine their effects upon individual processes of mRNA metabolism in HUVECs. Given the functions of the 5′ cap structure throughout mRNA metabolism, antisense oligonucleotides that target the 5′ cap region of a target transcript have the potential to modulate one or more metabolic stages of the message inside the cell. In this study we found that inhibition of protein expression by these RNase H independent antisense oligonucleotides was not due to effects on splicing or transport of the ICAM-1 transcript, but due instead to selective interference with the formation of the 80 S translation initiation complex. Interestingly, these antisense oligonucleotides also caused an increase in ICAM-1 mRNA abundance in the cytoplasm. These results imply that ICAM-1 mRNA turnover is coupled in part to translation.

Antisense oligonucleotides have been shown to be effective agents for inhibition of gene expression at the mRNA level (1Crooke S.T. Med. Res. Rev. 1996; 16: 319-344Google Scholar, 2Wagner R.W.

They may be described as exogenous regulators of mRNA metabolism intended to sterically interfere with one or more metabolic processes upon hybridization, such as initiation of translation, or to promote enzyme-mediated mRNA degradation by formation or exposure of a region for nuclease activity, such as RNase H. The mode of action of an antisense oligonucleotide in cells is dependent upon its composition (sugar, backbone, and base residues) and mRNA binding site location (5′-UTR, coding region, 3′-UTR). 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1; HUVECs, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; PE, phycoerythrin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; G3PDH, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1; HUVECs, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; PE, phycoerythrin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; G3PDH, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Although several types of antisense oligonucleotides, which differ in composition and target site, have been found to be effective agents for sequence-specific inhibition of gene expression in mammalian cells, direct or detailed evidence of their mode(s) of action remains limited (4Bennett C.F.

(ed) (1991) Integrins and ICAM-1 in Immune Responses: ChemicalImmunology, Vol. 50, pp. 98-158, S. Karger, BaselGoogle Scholar). ICAM-1 is also expressed on nonendothelial cells, such as keratinocytes, monocytes, and fibroblasts in response to inflammatory mediators. Elevated levels of ICAM-1 expression have been observed in a number of immune-related human diseases (11Albelda S.M. Smith C.W. Ward P.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 504-512Google Scholar, 12Pilewski J.M. Albelda S.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 1-3Google Scholar),e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and asthma. Thus, regulation of ICAM-1 gene expression is of therapeutic interest (13Brady H.R. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1993; 2: 171-182Google Scholar, 14Bennett C.F. Crooke S.T. Henderson B. Bodmer M.W.

The ICAM-1 gene has been sequenced, and the transcription initiation site has been characterized for several cell lines following induction by a variety of cytokines (16Voraberger G. Schäfer R. Stratowa C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2777-2786Google Scholar, 17Degitz K. Li L.-J. Caughman S.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 933-943Google Scholar).Previous research has demonstrated that elevated expression of ICAM-1 may be controlled in cells by phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides (4Bennett C.F. Condon T.P. Grimm S. Chan H. Chiang M-Y. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3530-3540Google Scholar, 5Chiang M-Y. Chan H. Zounes M.A. Freier S.M. Lima W.F. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18162-18171Google Scholar). At that time the most effective oligonucleotides were those that were compatible with RNase H and targeted the 3′-UTR of the transcript. Since then advances in chemical synthesis have brought forth a number of oligonucleotide modifications at the 2′-sugar position which give significant increases in duplex stability and nuclease resistance but do not support RNase H activity (19Mesmaeker A.D. Häner R. Martin P. Moser H.E. Acc. Chem. Res. 1995; 28: 366-374Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotides that bind more tightly to the target mRNA are expected to be more effective at interfering with the processes of metabolism when bound at suitable locations. Bulky substituents at this position also have been shown to provide a high degree of nuclease resistance.Biophysical and biological analysis of a set of these uniformly 2′-modified oligonucleotides (2′-O-methyl (20Iribarren A.M.

Therefore, antisense oligonucleotides which target the 5′ cap region of a designated transcript have the potential to modulate one or more metabolic stages of the message inside the cell (37Baker B.F. Crooke S.T. Lebleu B. Antisense Research and Applications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 37-53Google Scholar). In this study the antisense mode of action was determined by evaluation of the target transcript's metabolic processes (splicing, transport, translation, and stability) following antisense treatment and induction of gene expression.Table IBiological and biophysical profiles of modified antisense oligonucleotidesISIS number2′-Sugar modificationAntisense activityDuplex stabilityRankIC50T mΔT mΔΔG 037nm°C°CPO11158-O-(2-Methoxy)ethyl12.187.137.0−9.1412461-O-AllylNA76.526.4−7.373214-O-MethylNA83.733.6−7.853061-HNA58.48.3−2.8PS11159-O-(2-Methoxy)ethyl26.579.229.1−6.9511665-F32587.937.8−8.4712462-O-Allyl43470.320.2−5.753067-H54150.1ParentParent3224-O-Methyl6>5076.424.3−6.16Antisense activity (IC50) was determined by measurement of cell surface expression of ICAM-1 protein following treatment with each oligonucleotide at six concentrations in the range of 1.6–50 nm, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” IC50 values were calculated from the average of two sets of dose-response data points, where NA indicates that no IC50 was achieved or observed in the given dose range. Thermal melt analysis was performed as described previously (23Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol.

The respective scrambled control oligonucleotides, ISIS 12344 and 12345, showed negligible effects on ICAM-1 protein expression (Fig. 2). As indicated in Table I, both the phosphodiester, ISIS 11158, and the phosphorothioate, ISIS 11159, 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl-modified oligonucleotides were more potent inhibitors of ICAM-1 expression in HUVECs than the analogous RNase H-compatible phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide, ISIS 3067.Figure 22′-O-(2-Methoxy)ethyl-modified anti-ICAM-1 oligonucleotides are exceptionally effective at inhibiting ICAM-1 protein expression in comparison to the RNase H-competent ISIS 3067.

The control sequence, 5′-GATCGCGTCGGACTATGAAG-3′, is a scramble of the antisense sequence, i.e. identical in base composition. ISIS 10588 is the phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide analog. ISIS 12344 is the 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl phosphodiester analog and ISIS 12345 is the 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl phosphorothioate analog.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Intracellular distribution of the 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl-modified oligonucleotides was determined by fluorescence microscopy, using fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides, to further compare and delineate the basis of their antisense activity with respect to the first generation 2′-deoxyoligonucleotides (Fig. 3). As reported previously (42Bennett C.F. Chiang M-Y. Chan H. Shoemaker J.E. Mirabelli C.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1023-1033Google Scholar) treatment of HUVECs with the fluorescein-labeled 2′-deoxy phosphorothioate oligonucleotide, in the presence of the cationic lipid formulation (Lipofectin, Life Technologies, Inc.), resulted in a heterogeneous accumulation of the oligonucleotide in the cell nucleus as well as in punctate cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig.3 A). Treatment of HUVECs with the 2′-deoxy phosphodiester analog showed a diffuse distribution of label in the cytoplasm (Fig.3 B), attributed to degradation of the oligomer by nucleases (43Wickstrom E.

In comparison, the fluorescein-labeled 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl-modified phosphorothioate oligonucleotide yielded a distribution pattern (Fig. 3 C) similar to the 2′-deoxy analog (Fig. 3 A), with a high degree of localization in the nucleus. However in striking contrast to the 2′-deoxy analog (Fig. 3 B), the 2′-O-(methoxy)ethyl phosphodiester showed a homogeneous nuclear localization (Fig. 3 D), attributed to its greater resistance to nucleases, the absence of “nonspecific” phosphorothioate-protein interactions (45Brown D.A.

These data demonstrated that both the phosphodiester and phosphorothioate 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl-modified oligonucleotides were effectively delivered into the cell nucleus in the presence of cationic lipids (42Bennett C.F.

Interestingly, Northern blot analysis showed a significant increase in relative abundance of the ICAM-1 transcript in those cells treated with the anti-ICAM-1 oligonucleotides at both time points (Fig. 4). Nuclear runoff experiments showed that this increase in transcript abundance was not due to an increase in the rate of transcription of the ICAM-1 gene (data not shown).Figure 4Increase in target transcript abundance occurs in cells treated with 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl-modified antisense oligonucleotides which complement the 5′ cap region of ICAM-1.

As with ICAM-1 an increase in abundance of the E-selectin transcript was observed only in those cells treated with the 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl-modified oligonucleotide, ISIS 11929, that targets the 5′-terminal region of the E-selectin transcript (Fig.5). The increase in target transcript abundance following antisense treatment may be an attribute of these transiently expressed transcripts in combination with the antisense mode of action.Figure 5Increase in target transcript abundance also occurs in cells treated with 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl-modified antisense oligonucleotides which target the 5′ cap region of E-selectin.

The ICAM-1 gene consists of seven exons separated by six introns, with intron 1 approximately 4000 nucleotides in length (16Voraberger G. Schäfer R. Stratowa C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2777-2786Google Scholar). Evaluation of the Northern blots showed that this set of modified antisense oligonucleotides had no effect on splicing of the ICAM-1 pre-mRNA to the mature transcript, as evidenced by lack of ICAM-1 mRNA species or intermediates of longer lengths (data not shown).Nuclear and cytosolic fractionation was utilized to determine if antisense inhibition of ICAM-1 protein expression resulted from inhibition of transport of the mature transcript out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Fractionated mRNA was evaluated by Northern analysis 2 h post TNF-α induction for 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl oligonucleotide-treated (phosphorothioate and phosphodiester; antisense and control each at 50 nm) and untreated cells (Fig.6). At this time point no substantial alteration in the abundance of the ICAM-1 transcript was observed in the nuclear fractions of antisense treated cells (110–114%) versusscrambled control treated (113–118%) and untreated (100%). In contrast, a significant increase in the abundance of the ICAM-1 transcript was observed in the cytosolic fraction from the antisense treated cells, ISIS 11158 (230%) and ISIS 11159 (181%), in comparison to the scrambled control treated, ISIS 12344 (133%) and ISIS 12345 (108%), and untreated cells (100%). Relative abundance of the ICAM-1 transcript in each compartment was also determined 4 h post 1-h TNF-α induction. Under these conditions, the relative abundance of the ICAM-1 transcript was 451 and 425% in the cytosolic fraction and 128 and 126% in the nuclear fractions of the antisense treated cells, ISIS 11158 and 11159, respectively, relative to the untreated cells. The significant increase in abundance of the transcript in the cytoplasm of the antisense treated cells suggested a decrease in the rate at which the transcript is normally degraded. The lack of a substantial change in ICAM-1 mRNA abundance in the nuclear fraction indicated that the antisense oligonucleotides did not significantly affect the nucleocytoplasmic transport rate of the mature ICAM-1 transcript.Figure 62′-O-(2-Methoxy)ethyl-modified antisense oligonucleotides have no effect on nuclear-cytosolic distribution of the ICAM-1 transcript.

Cytosolic extracts were sedimented by linear sucrose gradient centrifugation (10–35%). The ethidium bromide-stained gel of the fractionated RNA showed a respectable separation of the subpolysomal and polysomal pools (Fig.7 A). Assignment of the fractions were verified by UV absorbance plots obtained during fractionation. Northern blots showed a significant difference in the polysomal distribution of the ICAM-1 transcript in cells treated with ISIS 11158 and 11159, in comparison to those of the controls, ISIS 12344 and 12345 (Fig. 7 B). The polysome profiles for the ISIS 11158 and 11159 treated cells showed the majority (71 and 65%, respectively) of the full-length target transcript localized in the subpolysome fractions, e.g.40 s and 60 s, whereas the ISIS 12344 and 12345 polysome profiles showed the majority (77 and 86%, respectively) of the target transcript in the monosome and polysome fractions.Figure 7Inhibition of translation initiation proves to be key mode of action for 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl-modified oligonucleotides that target the 5′ cap region of the ICAM-1 transcript in HUVECs. Polysome distribution profiles for cells treated with ISIS 12344 (phosphodiester scramble control), ISIS 11158 (phosphodiester antisense), ISIS 12345 (phosphorothioate scramble control), and 11159 (phosphorothioate antisense), each at 50 nm.

A total RNA standard (fraction S) was included on each gel for blot to blot normalization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The polysome profile data for ISIS 11158 and 11159 indicate that inhibition of ICAM-1 protein expression occurs through interference with translation initiation and specifically ribosomal assembly, as indicated by the dramatic redistribution of transcript into the subpolysome fractions. The formation of a stable antisense-mRNA duplex (or secondary structure) in the 5′ cap region is likely the basis of this effect (see Table I). The increase in abundance of the ICAM-1 mRNA in the cytosolic fraction of the antisense treated cells in conjunction with the change in the polysome distribution patterns indicates that one of the target transcript's decay pathways is coupled to translation. These data are consistent with observations of transcripts that contain stability determinants in the coding region, e.g. c-fos and c-myc (50Chen C-Y. A Xu N. Shyu A-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5777-5788Google Scholar,51Herrick D.J. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2119-2128Google Scholar).Regulation of gene expression may occur at one or more stages of mRNA metabolism. The most well known examples of regulation through mRNA metabolism have been found at the stages of translation (52Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translation Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996Google Scholar) and degradation (53Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Google Scholar) of the mature transcript, where certain mRNA sequences and structural elements have been found to be key regulatory determinants. Of particular relevance, it has been shown that stable secondary and tertiary structures located in the 5′-terminal region may regulate initiation of translation (54Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Google Scholar, 55Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2850-2854Google Scholar, 56Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Cell. 1985; 40: 515-526Google Scholar). The 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl-modified antisense oligonucleotides, complementary to the 5′-terminal region of the target transcript (nucleotides 1–20), mimic this endogenous mode of regulation in cells by inhibiting formation of the 80 S translation initiation complex. We believe that this event in turn affects the turnover rate of the transiently expressed ICAM-1 transcript. Antisense oligonucleotides have been shown to be effective agents for inhibition of gene expression at the mRNA level (1Crooke S.T. Med. Res. Rev. 1996; 16: 319-344Google Scholar, 2Wagner R.W.

They may be described as exogenous regulators of mRNA metabolism intended to sterically interfere with one or more metabolic processes upon hybridization, such as initiation of translation, or to promote enzyme-mediated mRNA degradation by formation or exposure of a region for nuclease activity, such as RNase H. The mode of action of an antisense oligonucleotide in cells is dependent upon its composition (sugar, backbone, and base residues) and mRNA binding site location (5′-UTR, coding region, 3′-UTR). 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1; HUVECs, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; PE, phycoerythrin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; G3PDH, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1; HUVECs, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; PE, phycoerythrin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; G3PDH, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Although several types of antisense oligonucleotides, which differ in composition and target site, have been found to be effective agents for sequence-specific inhibition of gene expression in mammalian cells, direct or detailed evidence of their mode(s) of action remains limited (4Bennett C.F.

https://openalex.org/W2018229588,"PSD-95/SAP90 is a member of membrane-associated guanylate kinases localized at postsynaptic density (PSD) in neuronal cells. Membrane-associated guanylate kinases are a family of signaling molecules expressed at various submembrane domains which have the PDZ (DHR) domains, the SH3 domain, and the guanylate kinase domain. PSD-95/SAP90 interacts withN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors 2A/B, Shaker-type potassium channels, and brain nitric oxide synthase through the PDZ (DHR) domains and clusters these molecules at synaptic junctions. However, neither the function of the SH3 domain or the guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95/SAP90, nor the protein interacting with these domains has been identified. We have isolated here a novel protein family consisting of at least four members which specifically interact with PSD-95/SAP90 and its related proteins through the guanylate kinase domain, and named these proteins SAPAPs (SAP90/PSD-95-AssociatedProteins). SAPAPs are specifically expressed in neuronal cells and enriched in the PSD fraction. SAPAPs induce the enrichment of PSD-95/SAP90 to the plasma membrane in transfected cells. Thus, SAPAPs may have a potential activity to maintain the structure of PSD by concentrating its components to the membrane area.

Since PSD has a characteristic structure and is contiguous to the presynaptic active zone, where neurotransmitter release occurs, PSD is proposed to have several functions, such as the stabilization of synaptic junctions, the concentration and regulation of neurotransmitter receptors, and the induction of the transcriptions in response to the synaptic transmission (reviewed in Ref. 1Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 732-737Google Scholar). Many studies have revealed several components of PSD, including fodrin (2Carlin R.K. Bartelt D.C. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 443-448Google Scholar), tubulin (3Walters B.B. Matus A.I. Nature. 1975; 257: 496-498Google Scholar), actin (4Kelly P.T. Cotman C.W. J.

PSD-95/SAP90, one of the components of PSD, has a characteristic molecular structure composed of three PDZ (DHR) domains, one SH3 domain, and one guanylate kinase domain. Three isoforms, SAP97, PSD-93/chapsyn, and SAP102, have been reported and all isoforms keep the same molecular structure (10Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Husain-Chishti A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The PDZ (DHR) domain is responsible for protein-protein interactions and identified in various proteins (reviewed in Ref. 15Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 102-103Google Scholar).

Thus, PSD-95/SAP90 is important for the concentration of receptors and channels at PSD. Another line of evidence for the importance of PSD-95/SAP90 at synaptic junctions comes from the recent findings about MAGUKs (reviewed in Ref. 21Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 8: 382-384Google Scholar). MAGUKs are a family of proteins expressed at various submembrane domains. They include Drosophiladiscs-large tumor suppressor gene (dlg-A) (22Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Google Scholar), nematodelin-2 (23Hoskins R. Hajnal A.F. Harp S.A. Kim S.K.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 255-265Google Scholar). All the members of MAGUKs keep the same molecular structures as that of PSD-95/SAP90. They have the PDZ (DHR), the SH3, and the guanylate kinase domains. Based on the characteristic molecular structure, MAGUKs are considered to play important roles in maintaining the structures of submembrane domains and to be involved in signaling at these domains. Indeed, genetic evidence indicates that MAGUKs are essential for maintenance of the structures of cell junctions. The product of dlg-A is expressed at separate junctions and neuromuscular junctions, and the mutations of this gene lead to neoplastic overgrowth of imaginal discs and morphological changes of synaptic bouton structures (22Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Google Scholar, 29Lahey T. Gorczyca M. Jia X-X. Budnik V. Neuron. 1994; 13: 823-835Google Scholar).Lin-2 expressed at Pn.p cells in nematode is involved in the localization of let-23, a receptor for lin-3, and essential for vulval induction (23Hoskins R. Hajnal A.F. Harp S.A. Kim S.K. Development. 1996; 22: 97-111Google Scholar). In the context of the general concept about MAGUKs, PSD-95/SAP90 is assumed to play pivotal roles in signaling at synaptic junctions, not only in the clustering of receptors, which may be mediated by domains other than the PDZ (DHR) domains. In contrast to the accumulation of information about the PDZ (DHR) domains, our knowledge about the SH3 domain and the guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95/SAP90 is limited. The SH3 domain is also responsible for protein-protein interactions and identified in a wide variety of proteins. However, the molecules interacting with the SH3 domain of PSD-95/SAP90 have not been identified. The guanylate kinase domain, is similar to an enzyme guanylate kinase, has the binding activity for GMP and GDP, but does not show kinase activity (30Kistner U. Garner C.C. Linial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 159-163Google Scholar). The mutations in this domain of dlg-A cause the abnormalities of imaginal discs (22Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Google Scholar). Thus, this domain should also have some essential role. To clarify the function of PSD-95/SAP90 and to identify novel components of PSD, we have tried to identify by use of the yeast two-hybrid method the molecules which interact with the region of PSD-95/SAP90 containing the SH3 domain and the guanylate kinase domain, and are localized at PSD. We have obtained novel proteins which are homologous to each other. We named them SAPAPs (SAP90/PSD-95-AssociatedProteins). SAPAPs function to induce the translocation of PSD-95/SAP90 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and may be a new family of proteins involved in signaling at PSD. The bait vector, pBTM116 PSD-95-3, was constructed by subcloning the insert encoding amino acid residues 430–724 of PSD-95/SAP90 intoEcoRI/SalI sites of pBTM116 (31Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid library constructed from adult rat brain cDNA was screened using pBTM116 PSD95-3 as a bait, as described previously (28Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (28Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Google Scholar). To obtain full-length clones, rat brain cDNA libraries in λ ZAP II (Stratagene) were screened using the inserts from pPrey1201, pPrey1305, pPrey1310, and pPrey1377 as described previously (28Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Google Scholar). For pPrey1201, 1 × 106clones were screened and 25 positive clones were obtained. For pPrey1305, 2 × 106 clones were screened and 10 positive clones were obtained. For pPrey1310, 1 × 106clones were screened and 60 positive clones were obtained. For pPrey1377, 1 × 106 clones were screened and 23 positive clones were obtained. Two at least overlapping clones for each SAPAP were analyzed. DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy nucleotide termination method using an ABI373 DNA sequencer. Prokaryote and eukaryote expression vectors, bait constructs, and prey constructs were constructed in pGexKG (32Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Google Scholar), pMalC2 (New England Biolabs), pCMV5 (a gift of Dr. David W. Russell), pBTM116, and pVP16-3 using standard molecular biology methods (33Sambrook J.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13022-13028Google Scholar). Various GST fusion constructs and maltose-binding protein fusion constructs contained the following amino acid residues: pGex PSD-95-1 and pMal PSD-95-1, 1–724 of rat PSD-95/SAP90; pGex PSD-95-2 and pMal PSD-95-2, 1–431 of rat PSD-95/SAP90; pGex PSD-95-4, 430–724 of rat PSD-95/SAP90; and pMal PSD-95-6, 534–724 of rat PSD-95/SAP90. Various bait constructs contained the following amino acids: pBTM116 SAP97-5, 587–910 of rat SAP97; pBTM116 PSRP1-3, 526–835 of rat PSRP1; pBTM116 Dlg-1, 601–960 of dlg-A; pBTM116 p55-1, 163–466 of human p55; pBTM116 CASK-11, 601–909 of rat CASK; pBTM116 ZO-1-1, 504–909 of mouse ZO-1; pBTM116 PSD-95-9, 534–724 of rat PSD-95/SAP90; pBTM116 SAP97-4, 726–910 of rat SAP97; pBTM116 PSRP1-2, 645–835 of rat PSRP1; pBTM116 Dlg-2, 770–960 of dlg-A; pBTM116 CASK-10, 711–909 of rat CASK; and pBTM116 PSD-95-11, 411–495 of rat PSD-95/SAP90. pVP16 SAPAP1–12 contained the full-length of SAPAP1. pCMV PSD-95-1 contained the full-length of PSD-95/SAP90 and pCMV PSD-95-2 contained amino acid residues 1–431 of PSD-95/SAP90. pCMV Myc vector was constructed by ligating the oligonucleotides, aattgccccccaacatggagcagaagcttatcagcgaggaggacctg/aattccaggtcctcctcgctgataagcttctgctccatgttggggggc, into the EcoRI site of pCMV5. pCMV Myc SAPAP1 was constructed by ligating the polymerase chain reaction fragment encoding the full-length of SAPAP1 into MluI/SalI sites of pCMV Myc, so that SAPAP1 was expressed with amino acids MEQKLISEEDL as the N-terminal tag. The partial cDNAs of rat SAP97,dlg-A, and p55 were obtained by polymerase chain reaction and the sequences were confirmed. GST fusion proteins and MBP fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (28Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Google Scholar). COS cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (34Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13022-13028Google Scholar). 293 cells were transfected with the calcium phosphate method using mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene). COS cells transfected with pCMV Myc SAPAP1 were sonicated in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucoside, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm leupeptin, and 5 mg/liter aprotinin) using 500 μl per of each 10-cm dish. The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. 1 ml of the supernatant was incubated with 30 pmol of various GST fusion proteins immobilized on the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed with lysis buffer four times, and analyzed through SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the monoclonal antibody against the Myc tag. The interactions of PSD-95/SAP90 and SAPAPs were evaluated by use of Biacore biosensor technology (Pharmacia Biosensor) based on the basic principles and detection methods as described previously (35Joehnsson U. Faegerstam L. Roos H. Roennberg J. Sjoelander S. Sternberg E. Stahlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Oestlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 520-527Google Scholar). The antibodies against GST were covalently fixed on a CM5 research grade sensor chip by the amine coupling kit (Pharmacia) and then the Escherichia colilysates containing approximately 500 pmol of GST-1201-3, GST-1305-2, and GST were passed on the chip to gain the elevation of about 3800 RU. GST-1201-3 contained amino acid residues 315–569 of SAPAP1. GST-1305-2 contained amino acid residues 480–577 of SAPAP2. The chip was equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline and various doses of various purified MBPs in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline were injected across the immobilized surfaces at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The binding activities (in RU) were measured as the difference between the baseline value determined 10 s prior to the sample injection and the measurements taken at the indicated time points. All experiments were performed at 25 °C. Data were analyzed using BIAevaluation program 2.1 (Pharmacia). Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the GST fusion proteins of SAPAP1 (anti-SAPAP1), -2 (anti-SAPAP2), -3 (anti-SAPAP3), and -4 (anti-SAPAP4) using rabbits. The antigens used for each antibody contained the following amino acid residues: anti-SAPAP1, 589–689 of SAPAP1; anti-SAPAP2, 569–676 of SAPAP2; anti-SAPAP3, 560–654 of SAPAP3; and anti-SAPAP4, 592–688 of SAPAP4. The amino acid residues used for the antibodies were specific for each SAPAP and each antibody was confirmed to be specific for each SAPAP. The antibody against PSD-95/SAP90 was raised against the GST fusion protein containing the full-length of PSD-95/SAP90 using rabbits (anti-PSD-95) or mice (monoclonal anti-PSD-95). The antibody against NMDA receptors 2A/B and various second antibodies were purchased from Chemicon. The monoclonal antibody against the Myc tag, QE10, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Embryos were obtained from Wistar rats on the gestation day 20. Hippocampi were isolated, dissociated, plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips (Matsunami), and cultured in minimal essential medium with 10% horse serum. After 4 days, the medium was replaced with minimal essential medium supplemented with N2 supplement (36Bottenstein J.E. Sato G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 514-517Google Scholar), 1 mg/ml ovalbumin, 1 mm pyruvate, and 5 mm cytosine arabinoside. Immunocytochemistry of hippocampal cells and 293 cells were performed using a confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad MRC1024). 293 cells transfected with various pCMV constructs were sonicated in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes/NaOH pH 7.4, 10 μm(4-amidinophenyl)-methanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmleupeptin, and 5 mg/liter aprotinin) using 300 μl/10-cm dish. The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Comparable amounts of cytosol and membrane fractions were analyzed through SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with either anti-PSD-95 antibody or anti-SAPAP1 antibody. Subcellular fractionation of fresh rat brains was performed as described previously (37Jones D.J. Matus A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 276-287Google Scholar, 38Brose N. Hofmann K. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25273-25280Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, and protein determination were performed using standard procedures as described previously (28Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Google Scholar). RNA blots were purchased fromCLONTECH and hybridized with uniformly labeled DNA probes according to the manufacturer's protocol. By use of the yeast two-hybrid method, we first searched for the proteins which interacted with the region of PSD-95/SAP90 containing both the SH3 domain and the guanylate kinase domain. 1.4 × 106yeast transformants with a rat brain cDNA library were screened. Nine positive clones were obtained and six clones of them were independent. Four clones (pPrey 1201, pPrey1305, pPrey1310, and pPrey1377) contained similar but not the same sequences, which showed no homology to known proteins. The remaining two clones (pPrey1294 and pPrey1314) did not show any homology to known proteins. We focused on pPrey1201, pPrey1305, pPrey1310, and pPrey1377, since the preliminary Northern blot analysis using the inserts from these prey clones showed strong signals only in brain and named the corresponding proteins SAPAP1 to -4. To determine the whole structures of SAPAPs, rat brain cDNA libraries were screened to obtain overlapping cDNA clones for each SAPAP using the insert from the corresponding prey clone as each probe. The sequence contexts of the putative initiator methionines of SAPAP1, -3, and -4 agreed well with the consensus sequence for initiator codons and were preceded by in-frame stop codons (39Kozak M. Nucleic. Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Google Scholar). The clone of SAPAP2 had another methionine at 237 bases upstream to the putative initiator codon. We identified the putative initiator methionine in the cDNA of SAPAP2 by comparison with those of other SAPAPs. The coding regions of SAPAPs showed 41–52% homology at the amino acid level, while 5′ and 3′ non-coding regions did not show significant homology (Fig.1, A and B). SAPAP1 to -4 showed calculated M r values of 110,172, 110,134, 106,123, and 108,678, and consisted of 992, 980, 977, and 992 amino acids, respectively. The amino acid sequences of SAPAP1 to -4 predicted hydrophilic proteins without a transmembrane region or a signal sequence. All SAPAPs had proline-rich domains in the middle region and the C-terminal region. Data bank searches revealed no significant homology to known proteins. pPrey1201, pPrey1305, pPrey1310, and pPrey1377 contained amino acid residues 315–556 of SAPAP1, 480–577 of SAPAP2, 463–605 of SAPAP3, and 370–617 of SAPAP4, respectively. Based on the homology conserved among the peptides from these four pPrey clones, the domain of SAPAPs essential for the interaction with the region of PSD-95/SAP90 used as the bait can be tentatively concluded to be located in the region of about 80 amino acid residues in the middle portion (Fig. 1 A). To confirm whether the clones of SAPAPs were full-length clones, we constructed eukaryotic expression vectors using these clones and checked the expressions of SAPAPs in COS cells. The polyclonal antibodies were raised against SAPAP1, -2, -3, and -4 using peptides specific for each SAPAP. The antibodies against SAPAP1, -2, and -4 recognized the proteins with M r of about 140,000 and the antibody against SAPAP3 recognized the protein with aM r of about 120,000 in COS cells transfected with each pCMV construct (data not shown). The sizes of the proteins detected in the transfected COS cells were different from the calculated sizes based on the sequences. However, these antibodies also recognized the proteins with M r of 140,000 or 120,000 in brain homogenates (data not shown). Therefore, clones of SAPAP1 to -4 are concluded to be the full-length clones of SAPAPs, and SAPAPs may show abnormal mobilities on SDS-PAGE due to post-translational modifications. We examined by the yeast two-hybrid method whether SAPAPs interact with MAGUKs other than PSD-95/SAP90. Various bait constructs which contained the SH3 domain and the guanylate kinase domain of various MAGUKs were prepared and tested for interactions with original prey clones (TableI). All prey clones of SAPAPs (pPrey1201, pPrey1305, pPrey1310, and pPrey1377) interacted with bait constructs containing both the SH3 domain and the guanylate kinase domain of not only PSD-95/SAP90, but also SAP97, PSD-95/SAP90-related protein 1 (PSRP1), and dlg-A. The clones did not interact with the bait constructs containing the SH3 domain and the guanylate kinase domain of p55, CASK, or ZO-1. PSRP1 is a novel isoform of PSD-95/SAP90, which is considered to be an alternative splicing isoform of SAP1022. Of these MAGUKs, PSD-95/SAP90, SAP97, PSRP1, anddlg-A form a closely related family different from p55, CASK, and ZO-1. All SAPAPs interacted specifically with members of this closely related family.Table IInteraction of SAPAPs with various MAGUKsControl (pVP16)SAPAP1 (pPrey1201)SAPAP2 (pPrey1305)SAPAP3 (pPrey1310)SAPAP4 (pPrey1377)Full-length of SAPAP1 (pVP16 SAPAP1–12)Control(pBTM116)ND1-aND, not detectable.NDNDNDNDNDConstructs containing the SH3 and guanylate kinase domainsPSD-95/SAP90(pBTM116 PSD-95–3)ND(5.9 ± 0.1) × 103(1.7 ± 0.1) ×103(2.4 ± 0.1) ×102(1.5 ± 0.2) ×103(6.9 ± 0.4) × 10SAP97(pBTM116 SAP97–5)ND(3.7 ± 0.4) ×102(1.4 ± 0.1) ×103(4.3 ± 0.1) ×102(2.2 ± 0.1) ×103NT1-bNT, not tested.PSRP1(SAP102)(pBTM116 PSRP1–3)(2.1 ± 0.3) ×102(3.4 ± 0.1) ×103(3.3 ± 0.2) ×103(7.5 ± 0.3) ×102(2.1 ± 0.3) ×103NTdlg-A(pBTM116 dlg-1)ND(4.3 ± 0.6) ×102(1.2 ± 0.1) ×103(5.1 ± 0.1) ×102(3.1 ± 0.1) ×103NTp55(pBTM116 p55–1)NDNDNDNDNDNTCASK(pBTM116 CASK-11)NDNDNDNDNDNTZO-1(pBTM116 ZO-1–1)NDNDNDNDNDNTConstructs containing the guanylate kinase domainPSD-95/SAP90(pBTM116 PSD-95–9)ND(4.9 ± 0.1) ×102(1.2 ± 0.1) ×103(3.4 ± 0.3) ×102(3.3 ± 0.2) ×103(3.2 ± 0.4) ×10SAP-97(pBTM116 SAP97–4)ND(5.8 ± 0.3) ×102(8.9 ± 0.8) ×102(4.4 ± 0.1) ×102(4.1 ± 0.2) ×103NTPSRP1(SAP102)(pBTM116 PSRP1–2)ND(7.7 ± 0.7) ×102(1.3 ± 0.1) ×103(4.0 ± 0.1) ×102(3.8 ± 0.4) ×103NTDlg-A(pBTM116 dlg-2)ND(5.2 ± 0.1) ×102(1.6 ± 0.1) ×103(3.8 ± 0.1) ×102(3.3 ± 0.1) ×102NTCASK(pBTM116 CASK-10)NDNDNDNDNDNTA construct containing the SH3 domainPSD-95/SAP90(pBTM116 PSD-95–11)NDNDNDNDNDNDYeast clones cotransfected with the prey pVP16 and the bait pBTM116 vectors in the indicated combinations were selected on the selection plates and grown in selection medium. pBTM116 PSD-95–3, pBTM116 SAP97–5, pBTM116 PSRP1–3, pBTM116 dlg-1, pBTM116 p55–1, pBTM116 CASK-11, and pBTM116 ZO-1–1 contained both the SH3 domain and the guanylate kinase domain of various MAGUKs. pBTM116 PSD-95–9, pBTM116 SAP97–4, pBTM116 PSRP1–2, pBTM116 dlg-2, and pBTM116 CASK-10 contained the guanylate kinase domain of various MAGUKs. pBTM116 PSD-95–11 contained the SH3 domain of PSD-95/SAP90. pVP16 SAPAP1–12 contained the full length of SAPAP1.

The β-galactosidase activity (unit/mg protein n = 3 ± S.D.) in the yeast lysates was measured in triplicate. Data represent the mean values with ±S.D. To determine which region of PSD-95/SAP90 is necessary for interaction with SAPAPs, we tested the interactions of the original prey clones and bait constructs containing various regions of PSD-95/SAP90 and its related proteins. The prey clones of SAPAPs interacted with the bait constructs containing only the guanylate kinase domains of PSD-95/SAP90, SAP97, PSRP1, and dlg-A, but not with the bait constructs containing the SH3 domain of PSD-95/SAP90 (Table I). Therefore, the guanylate kinase domains of PSD-95/SAP90 and its related proteins are sufficient for interaction with SAPAPs. We also tested the interactions between the bait construct containing the SH3 domain or the guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95/SAP90 and the prey construct containing full-length SAPAP1. The bait construct containing the SH3 domain did not interact even with the prey construct containing full-length SAPAP1 in contrast to the bait construct containing the guanylate kinase domain (Table I). This result suggests that the SH3 domain of PSD-95/SAP90 is not involved in the interaction with SAPAP1. To examine the interaction of PSD-95/SAP90 and SAPAPs in vitro, the extracts of COS cells expressing SAPAP1 with the Myc tag at the N terminus were incubated with various GST fusion proteins fixed on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the antibody against the Myc tag. SAPAP1 was bound to GST-PSD-95-1 containing full-length PSD-95/SAP90 and GST-PSD-95-4 containing both the SH3 domain and the guanylate kinase domain (Fig. 2). SAPAP1 was not bound to either GST or GST-PSD-95-2 containing three PDZ (DHR) domains (Fig.2). To confirm whether SAPAPs directly interact with PSD-95/SAP90, Biacore biosensor technology was used. GST fusion proteins containing the potential PSD-95/SAP90 interacting region of SAPAPs or GST itself were fixed on the Biacore sensor chip through the antibody against GST. MBP fusion protein containing the guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95/SAP90 was flowed on the chip and the affinities for the GST fusion constructs were measured (Fig. 3). The K d value of PSD-95/SAP90 for the GST fusion protein of SAPAP1 was calculated to be 2.1 × 10−7m from the association (k a = 2.7 × 103m−1 s−1) and dissociation (k d = 5.6 × 10−4s−1) constants. The K d value of PSD-95/SAP90 for the GST fusion protein of SAPAP2 was calculated to be 2.3 × 10−7m from the association (k a = 2.6 × 103m−1 s−1) and dissociation (k d = 5.9 × 10−4s−1) constants. The MBP fusion protein of SNAP-25A did not interact with SAPAPs (data not shown). Neither the MBP fusion protein containing three PDZ (DHR) domains nor the MBP fusion protein containing the SH3 domain interacted with SAPAPs (data not shown). Northern blot analysis using the coding region of SAPAP1 showed 6.4-kb major and 5.2-kb minor hybridizing mRNAs in rat brain, possibly because of differential polyadenylation. In rat testis, mRNA with a smaller size was weakly observed. The significance of this weak signal was unknown. Other rat tissues tested, including heart, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney, did not show any detectable signal (Fig.4 A). Northern blot analysis using the coding region of SAPAP2 showed a 8.0-kb major hybridizing mRNA and three weak smaller signals, only in brain (Fig. 4 B). Northern blot analyses of SAPAP3 and -4 showed 5.0-kb and 4.2-kb hybridizing mRNAs only in brain, respectively (data not shown). In Western blot analysis using the polyclonal antibody against SAPAP1, the signal was detected only in rat brain (Fig. 4 C). Western blot analyses using antibodies against SAPAP2, -3, and -4 showed similar results (data not shown). To determine whether SAPAPs are neuronal proteins, we stained these proteins in primary cultured hippocampal neurons from rat embryo using antibodies. The antibody against SAPAP1 stained in the dendrites, the cell bodies, and the nuclei of hippocampal neurons (Fig. 5 A). When the antibody was preincubated with an excess amount of GST fusion protein of SAPAP1, the signals detected in the dendrites and cell bodies disappeared, while the signals in the nuclei remained (Fig.5 B). Therefore, signals detected in dendrites and cell bodies were considered to be specific. This staining pattern was similar to that of PSD-95/SAP90 (data not shown). The glia cells were not stained with the antibody against SAPAP1 (data not shown). Essentially the same results were obtained using the antibodies against SAPAP2, -3, and -4 (data not shown). Western blot analysis of the subcellular fractions of rat brain indicated that proteins detected with antibody against SAPAP1 were enriched in the synaptosome fraction (P2). The subfractionations of synaptosomes into the synaptic vesicle fraction (S3), the lysed synaptosomal membrane fraction (P3), and the synaptosomal membrane fraction (SPM) showed that SAPAP1 was enriched in SPM, in which PSD-95/SAP90 and NMDA receptors 2A/B were also enriched. PSD was prepared by Triton X-100 extraction of SPM. SAPAP1 was further enriched in PSD (Fig. 6). Western blot analyses using antibodies against SAPAP2, -3, and -4 showed essentially the same results (data not shown). In the last set of experiments, we expressed SAPAPs and PSD-95/SAP90 in various combinations in 293 cells to examine whether SAPAPs interacted with PSD-95/SAP90 in intact cells. When PSD-95/SAP90 was expressed in 293 cells, PSD-95/SAP90 was located in the cytosol (Fig.7 A). On the other hand, SAPAP1 was located at the plasma membrane in 293 cells (Fig. 7 B). Coexpression of PSD-95/SAP90 with SAPAP1 caused the translocation of PSD-95/SAP90 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane where SAPAP1 was located (Fig.7 C). However, when the pCMV construct encoding only three PDZ (DHR) domains of PSD-95/SAP90 (pCMV PSD-95-2) was used, the distribution of the product of this construct was not affected by SAPAP1 (Fig. 7 D). Other SAPAPs showed essentially the same effect on the translocation of PSD-95/SAP90 (data not shown). The translocation of PSD-95/SAP90 depending on the presence of SAPAPs was also verified through subfractionations of transfected 293 cells as described above. SAPAP1 was recovered in the membrane fraction of the transfected 293 cells, both when it was expressed alone and when it was coexpressed with PSD-95/SAP90 (Fig. 8 A). PSD-95/SAP90 was mainly recovered in the cytosol fraction in the transfected 293 cells, when it was expressed alone, but was recovered in the membrane fraction, when it was coexpressed with SAPAP1 (Fig.8 B). The protein containing only the PDZ (DHR) domains of PSD-95/SAP90 was recovered in the cytosol fraction, even when coexpressed with SAPAP1 (Fig. 8 C). Similar results were obtained using other SAPAPs than SAPAP1 (data not shown). In this article, we have reported four novel proteins which interact with the guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95/SAP90. We have named these proteins SAPAPs. We have raised polyclonal antibodies against each SAPAP and confirmed the expressions of SAPAPs in COS cells. The M r of SAPAPs detected in COS cells transfected with pCMV constructs containing the coding regions of the clones of SAPAPs are the same as those in brain. Therefore, these clones are considered to be full-length clones. We have concluded that SAPAPs actually interact with PSD-95/SAP90 based on the following lines of evidence: 1) the recombinant constructs of SAPAPs interact with PSD-95/SAP90 in vitro with theK d values of about 2 × 10−7m, these values are in a reasonable range; 2) SAPAPs are expressed in neurons and highly enriched in the PSD fraction in which PSD-95/SAP90 are enriched; 3) SAPAPs also show interactions with PSD-95/SAP90 in 293 cells and induce the translocation of PSD-95/SAP90 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane; and 4) in the preliminary yeast two-hybrid screenings for SAPAPs-associated proteins, PSD-95/SAP90, SAP97, and PSD-93/chapsyn are obtained reproducibly. 2M. Irie, unpublished observation. SAPAPs are about 50% homologous to each other at the amino acid level. The 200 amino acids in the C-terminal region are especially well conserved, although the conserved regions are also observed in the N-terminal region and in the middle region. SAPAPs show no homology to known proteins and the sequences do not suggest the functions of SAPAPs. Since the original prey clones obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening contain various partial sequences of SAPAPs, we can tentatively map the PSD-95/SAP90-interacting region of SAPAPs. This region is located in the middle region and encompasses about 80 amino acid residues, which do not contain any known motif. The potentially interesting domains are the proline-rich domains conserved in the middle (PPPI/VPP) and C-terminal regions (PPPV/DP and PPPI/VP). The proline-rich domains are generally considered to interact with the SH3 domain. Although the proline-rich domains in the middle regions of SAPAP1, -2, and -4 have the consensus motif of the sequences of the proteins which interact with the SH3 domain of Grb2, the surrounding amino acid contexts of other proline-rich domains do not completely fit to the criteria of the proline-rich domains reported to interact with the SH3 domain (40Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Google Scholar, 41Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quilliam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Google Scholar). It is at present unknown whether these domains function for the interaction with other molecules. The attempt to identify the SAPAP-interacting region of PSD-95/SAP90 has first been performed using the yeast two-hybrid method. The original prey clones of SAPAPs interact with the bait construct containing the guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95/SAP90 alone, and not the bait construct containing the SH3 domain. Thus, the guanylate kinase domain is sufficient for the interaction. The bait construct containing the SH3 domain alone does not interact with the prey clone containing the full-length of SAPAP1, either. The expression of this bait construct is confirmed, since PSD-95/SAP90 itself is obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening using this bait construct.2Furthermore, since no SAPAPs are obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening using the SH3 domain of PSD-95/SAP90 as a bait,2SAPAPs are not considered to be the interacting proteins with the SH3 domain of PSD-95/SAP90. SAPAP1 expressed in COS cells do not interact with the GST fusion protein containing only three PDZ (DHR) domains of PSD-95/SAP90. SAPAPs do not interact with the product of the construct containing only three PDZ (DHR) domains in the transfected 293 cells either. Therefore, the guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95/SAP90 is concluded to be the interacting domain with SAPAPs. SAPAPs are expressed in brain and highly enriched in the PSD fraction. However, in primary cultured rat hippocampal cells, the specific immunoreactivities detected by the antibodies are almost uniformly distributed in the cell bodies and the dendrites of neurons, and do not show high enrichment at synaptic junctions. This pattern is almost the same as that observed for PSD-95/SAP90. The reason why the enrichment of SAPAPs and PSD-95/SAP90 at synaptic junctions is not observed in primary cultured rat hippocampal cells is not clear. The establishment of the intact synaptic junctions may require some conditions, such as close contacts and continuous stimuli between neurons, which are not supplied in the primary cultures of hippocampal cells. Although the functions of SAPAPs are unknown, they may function as anchoring molecules to facilitate the interactions of PSD-95/SAP90 and the molecules located at the plasma membrane, since SAPAPs induce the enrichment of PSD-95/SAP90 at the plasma membrane in 293 cells. However, preliminary experiments suggest that SAPAPs have no effect on the clustering of NMDA receptor 2A by PSD-95/SAP90, although further studies are necessary. As discussed above, not all the proline-rich domains of SAPAPs have the consensus motif for the interacting domains with the SH3 domains. However, there is a possibility that some of the proline-rich domains of SAPAPs may interact with unidentified molecules and SAPAPs may work as an adaptor between PSD-95/SAP90 and these molecules.

Here we describe the molecular cloning of SLAP-130, a SLP-76-associated phosphoprotein of 130 kDa. We demonstrate that SLAP-130 is hematopoietic cell-specific and associates with the SH2 domain of SLP-76. Additionally, we show that SLAP-130 is a substrate of the T cell antigen receptor-induced protein tyrosine kinases. Interestingly, we find that in contrast to SLP-76, overexpression of SLAP-130 diminishes T cell antigen receptor-induced activation of the interleukin-2 promoter in Jurkat T cells and interferes with the augmentation of interleukin-2 promoter activity seen when SLP-76 is overexpressed in these cells.

Weiss A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 59-64Google Scholar). Our efforts to characterize substrates of the TCR-induced PTK activity led to the cloning of SLP-76, a tyrosine-phosphorylated hematopoietic cell-specific protein that associates with the SH3 domains of Grb2 (2Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A. Koretzky G.A. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7029-7032Google Scholar, 3Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Jackman J.K. Sun Q. Olson A.L. Findell P.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21608-21613Google Scholar). A possible function of SLP-76 in T cells was suggested by experiments showing that overexpression of SLP-76 augments TCR-mediated signals that lead to the induction of IL-2 gene promoter activity (4Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Google Scholar, 5Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Google Scholar). We have shown that the activity of SLP-76 requires engagement of the TCR and that overexpression of SLP-76 results in increased activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade following TCR ligation. 2M. A. Musci, D. G. Motto, S. E. Ross, N. Fang, and G. A. Koretzky, submitted for publication. Interestingly, three distinct regions of SLP-76 that are responsible for protein-protein interactions in T cells are required for its ability to augment IL-2 promoter activity when overexpressed (6Fang N. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3769-3773Google Scholar, 7Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H. Wilkinson S.E. Williams D.H. Johnson R. Kong G. Chan A.C. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19641-19644Google Scholar).2 These data suggest that SLP-76 functions as a link between proteins that regulate signals generated by TCR ligation. To investigate the function of SLP-76 in T cells further, we and others have begun to characterize SLP-76-associated proteins that may participate with SLP-76 in transducing signals from the TCR to the nucleus. These proteins include Vav, which associates with the amino-terminal acidic region of SLP-76 in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner (5Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Google Scholar, 8Onodera H. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22225-22230Google Scholar, 9Tuosto L. Michel F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1161-1167Google Scholar); the adapter protein Grb2, which interacts with a proline-rich motif of SLP-76 via its SH3 domains (3Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Jackman J.K. Sun Q. Olson A.L. Findell P.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21608-21613Google Scholar, 4Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Google Scholar); and two unidentified tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 64 and 130 kDa and a serine/threonine kinase, all of which associate with the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain of SLP-76 (4Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Google Scholar). In this study, we report the cloning of the cDNA encoding a 130-kDa protein (SLAP-130 for SLP-76 associatedphosphoprotein of 130 kDa) that associates with the SH2 domain of SLP-76. Additionally, we provide evidence that SLAP-130 may function as a negative regulator of TCR signals that activate IL-2 gene transcription. Jurkat T cells were maintained as described (10Musci M.A. Beaves S.L. Ross S.E. Yi T. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1565-1571Google Scholar). JA2/SLP-SH2, a Jurkat T cell variant expressing an A2/SLP-SH2 chimera, was maintained in medium supplemented with 2 mg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The SH2 domain of SLP-76 was amplified by PCR and subcloned in frame with HLA-A2 in pcDNA3/A2/HCP (10Musci M.A. Beaves S.L. Ross S.E. Yi T. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1565-1571Google Scholar) to generate pcDNA3/A2/SLP-SH2. The amino-terminal 1350 nucleotides of SLAP-130 were amplified from Jurkat RNA and ligated in frame with the FLAG tag in pEF/SLP-76 (4Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Google Scholar). The remaining 3′ cDNA was amplified from Jurkat RNA by overlap extension PCR. The resulting fragment was ligated in frame with the amino-terminal 1350 bp in pEF above to create pEF/SLAP-130. pEF/A2, the expression vector containing HLA-A2 cDNA, was a gift of B. Shraven (University of Heidelberg, Germany). NFAT-luc was a gift of G. Crabtree (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA). The expressed sequence-tagged (EST) clone (I.M.A.G.E. consortium ID number 241254) was obtained from Genome Systems, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Anti-A2 mAb CR11–351 (gift of C. Lutz, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Anti-TCR mAb C305 (gift of A. Weiss, University of California, San Francisco, CA). Anti-FLAG mAb M2 (International Biotechnologies Inc., New Haven, CT). Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnologies Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-sheep antiserum (Bio-Rad). Anti-SLP-76 sheep antiserum has been described previously (4Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Google Scholar). Anti-SLAP-130 sheep antiserum was generated against a GST fusion protein containing amino acids 1–340 of human SLAP-130. Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-TCR mAb (C305 acites, 1:1000) for the indicated times or pervanadate (11Secrist J.P. Burns L.A. Karnitz L. Koretzky G.A. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5886-5893Google Scholar) for 1 min and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10Musci M.A. Beaves S.L. Ross S.E. Yi T. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1565-1571Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, antibodies were conjugated to GammaBind Plus Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) for 2 h at 4 °C. Lysates were subjected to precipitation with the indicated antibodies or GST fusion protein for 2 h at 4 °C. Precipitated complexes were washed four times in high salt lysis buffer (500 mm NaCl), resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. A large scale anti-A2 immunoprecipitation of pervanadate-stimulated JA2/SLP-SH2 cells was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and visualized by Ponceau S staining. The protein band of 130 kDa was excised and subjected to trypsin digestion and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography for protein sequencing. Individual peptides were sequenced using a Procise 492 protein sequencer (Perkin-Elmer/ABD, Foster City, CA). One peptide sequence, PPNVDLTK, was represented in an EST clone containing an open reading frame of 1074 bp. Nucleotides 1088–1266 (Fig. 1) were amplified by PCR from the EST and used to screen a human thymus λgt10 cDNA library (#NL1127a, Promega, Madison, WI). A λ clone was identified containing 1008 bp 5′ of the EST. The remaining cDNA was amplified from Jurkat cDNA by 3′ RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) using the Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Independent amplification of the entire coding sequence of SLAP-130 from Jurkat RNA was performed by RT-PCR using the GeneAmp kit (Perkin-Elmer). Northern blot analysis was performed following the protocols included with the human multiple tissue Northern Blots I and II (CLONTECH). A SLAP-130 PCR product (nucleotides 1088–1266) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham) by random priming and hybridized to poly(A)+ RNA from multiple tissues. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in cytomix (12van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Google Scholar) at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/400 μl of cytomix/cuvette. Cells were electroporated at 250V, 960μF using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) with 15 μg of NFAT-luc, 5 μg of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase, and 40 μg of either pEF/SLP-76 or pEF/SLAP-130. The total amount of plasmid DNA was equilibrated to 100 μg with the vector control pEF/A2. After 24 h, 5 × 105 cells were stimulated in triplicate for 10 h with media or anti-TCR mAb C305 (ascites 1:1000). Additionally, triplicate samples of 5 × 105 unstimulated cells were assayed for β-galactosidase activity using the Galacto-Light Plus Reporter Gene Assay System (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Luciferase activity was determined as described previously (10Musci M.A. Beaves S.L. Ross S.E. Yi T. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1565-1571Google Scholar). Luciferase light units were normalized to β-galactosidase activity present in each transfectant to standardize for transfection efficiency. We have shown previously that the SH2 domain of SLP-76 associates with two unidentified tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins upon stimulation of Jurkat T cells with either anti-TCR mAb or the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate (4Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Google Scholar). To facilitate purification of these SLP-76-associated proteins, we established a variant of the Jurkat T cell line, JA2/SLP-SH2, which expresses a chimeric surface protein consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the HLA-A2 molecule in frame with the SH2 domain of SLP-76. The A2 epitope enabled the isolation of proteins associated with the SLP-76 SH2 domain by immunoprecipitation with anti-A2 mAb. JA2/SLP-SH2 cells were stimulated with pervanadate for maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Anti-A2 immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. A single major species of approximately 130 kDa was excised and subjected to tryptic digestion to generate peptides for protein sequencing. One peptide sequence, PPNDVLTK, was represented in an EST clone. Sequencing this clone revealed an open reading frame of over 1000 bp. A region of this clone was then used to probe a human thymus λgt10 cDNA library to obtain further sequence. A cDNA clone containing 370 bp of the EST sequence and an additional 1008 bp of coding sequence 5′ of the EST was isolated and found to contain a putative start site 27 bases downstream of a stop codon. A cDNA containing the remaining 3′-coding sequence was amplified from Jurkat cDNA by 3′ RACE and contained 267 additional bases of coding sequence followed by a stop codon 2349 bases downstream of the putative start. A contiguous cDNA was generated by RT-PCR amplification of pp130 from Jurkat RNA (Fig. 1). This sequence was confirmed by sequencing the product of multiple independent RT-PCR reactions. We have designated this protein SLAP-130 for SLP-76 associatedphosphoprotein of 130 kDa. The complete open reading frame of SLAP-130 consists of 2349 bp translating to a protein of 783 amino acids with an abundance of proline (12%) and charged (31%) residues. Putative nuclear localization sequences are found within amino acids 480–503 and 683–700 (Ref. 13Robbins S.M. Dilworth R. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Google Scholar and see Fig. 1). We do not know yet whether SLAP-130 is present in the nucleus of Jurkat T cells. There are several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl-terminal region of the molecule that may be responsible for the interaction of SLAP-130 with the SH2 domain of SLP-76. In addition, there are four tyrosines (residues 462, 595, 651, and 771) present in motifs that may mediate binding to the SH2 domain of src family kinases (14Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 470-475Google Scholar), suggesting that SLAP-130 may interact with proteins other than SLP-76 in T cells. Northern blot analysis of human mRNA from multiple tissues was performed to determine the tissue distribution of SLAP-130 (Fig. 2). As shown, SLAP-130 mRNA is expressed in hematopoietic tissues (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, spleen, and thymus) but not in non-lymphoid tissues. Additionally, SLAP-130 was amplified as a single product from total Jurkat RNA (data not shown), demonstrating expression in this cell line. Translation of the open reading frame of the SLAP-130 cDNA predicts a protein with a molecular mass of 86 kDa. However, the presence of stop codons flanking both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the putative coding sequence suggested that we had isolated the full-length cDNA encoding a 130-kDa, SLP-76-associated protein. This was confirmed by generating an epitope (FLAG)-tagged version of SLAP-130 cDNA (pEF/SLAP-130) for transient expression in Jurkat T cells. As shown in Fig. 3 A, transfection of Jurkat T cells with pEF/SLAP-130 results in the expression of a protein reactive with anti-FLAG mAb that migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 130 kDa (lane 2). This protein does not appear in lysates of cells transfected with the control vector pEF (lane 1). Whether the apparent migration of SLAP-130 at 130 kDa instead of the predicted 86 kDa results from post-translational modifications or the abundance of charged amino acids present in the molecule is not yet known. To investigate further whether the protein encoded by the SLAP-130 cDNA is identical to the 130-kDa, SLP-76-associated phosphoprotein, we prepared a GST fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of SLP-76 (GST/SH2). As shown in Fig. 3 B, this fusion protein precipitates epitope-tagged SLAP-130 from pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat cells (lane 4), but not from resting cells (lane 3) transfected with pEF/SLAP-130. The loss of function mutant of the SLP-76 SH2 domain when expressed as a GST fusion protein (GST/R448K) fails to associate with FLAG-SLAP-130 in either resting or pervanadate-stimulated cells (lanes 1 and 2). The protein precipitated by the wild type SLP-76 SH2 domain migrates identically to a protein detected by anti-FLAG immunoblot analysis of an anti-FLAG immunoprecipitate (lane 5) or whole cell lysates (lane 6) from Jurkat cells transfected with pEF/SLAP-130. Additionally, the FLAG-SLAP-130 protein migrates identically to an endogenous tyrosine-phosphorylated protein precipitated by the SLP-76 SH2 fusion protein from untransfected Jurkat cells stimulated with pervanadate (lane 7). The association of SLP-76 and SLAP-130 in Jurkat T cells was investigated using anti-SLAP-130 sheep antiserum. The anti-SLAP-130 antiserum, but not preimmune serum, precipitates and immunoblots a protein of 130 kDa in Jurkat T cell lysates (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–3). To determine if SLAP-130 and SLP-76 associate within cells, lysates were prepared from resting and pervanadate stimulated Jurkat cells. These lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SLP-76, followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-SLAP-130. As shown, SLAP-130 is present in SLP-76 immunoprecipitates from resting Jurkat cells (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). These results are consistent with the low levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated SLAP-130 seen in unstimulated Jurkat cells (see Fig. 4 B) and our previous finding of a 130-kDa phosphoprotein associated with SLP-76 in resting cells (4Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Google Scholar). However, this interaction is not always demonstrated in the resting state, as shown in Fig. 3 B. The amount of SLAP-130 associating with SLP-76 increases following stimulation of Jurkat with pervanadate (lane 5). We next investigated whether SLAP-130 is a substrate of the TCR-induced PTKs. Jurkat T cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-TCR mAb or pervanadate. At the indicated time points whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SLAP-130 antiserum followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (Fig.4 B, top panel). As noted above, there is a basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation of SLAP-130 in resting Jurkat. TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SLAP-130 occurs maximally at 1 min and diminishes to basal levels within 15 min of TCR stimulation. To demonstrate equal loading of SLAP-130 in each lane, the anti-phosphotyrosine blot was stripped and immunoblotted with anti-SLAP-130 antiserum (Fig. 4 B, lower panel). We and others have shown that overexpression of SLP-76 augments TCR signals leading to IL-2 promoter activity (4Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Google Scholar, 5Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Google Scholar). Since a functional SH2 domain is required for SLP-76 activity in Jurkat T cells (4Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Google Scholar, 7Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H. Wilkinson S.E. Williams D.H. Johnson R. Kong G. Chan A.C. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19641-19644Google Scholar), we speculated that proteins associated with the SLP-76 SH2 domain would also regulate signals through the TCR in a positive manner. To determine the effect of SLAP-130 on signals generated by TCR ligation, Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with pEF/SLAP-130 or a control vector and a luciferase reporter construct driven by the NFAT response element. Fig. 5 A demonstrates that, in contrast to the effect of SLP-76 on T cell signaling, overexpression of SLAP-130 results in diminished NFAT activity following TCR ligation. Furthermore, co-transfection of SLAP-130 and SLP-76 reveals that overexpression of SLAP-130 inhibits the augmentation of TCR-stimulated IL-2 promoter activity by SLP-76. Expression of the FLAG-tagged cDNAs was confirmed by immunoblotting whole cell lysates with anti-FLAG mAb. We were surprised to discover that overexpression of SLAP-130 appears to interfere with TCR-induced NFAT activation in Jurkat cells and, additionally, inhibits the ability of transfected SLP-76 to augment TCR responses. Unfortunately, the primary sequence of SLAP-130 does not provide insight into how it may function as an inhibitor of TCR-induced NFAT activation. Structure-function experiments are ongoing to determine the regions of SLAP-130 required for its inhibitory effects. Northern blot analyses indicate that SLP-76 and SLAP-130 are expressed coordinately in hematopoietic tissues. Defining their role in other hematopoietic cells may provide insight into how these proteins regulate T cell signals. We have found an association between the SLP-76 SH2 domain and a 130-kDa protein in rat basophillic leukemia cells (15Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Motto D.G. Zhang J. Siraganian R.P. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1363-1367Google Scholar). Since engagement of the high affinity receptor for IgE on rat basophillic leukemia cells leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 (15Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Motto D.G. Zhang J. Siraganian R.P. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1363-1367Google Scholar), experiments are ongoing to determine if overexpression of SLP-76 augments signaling events downstream of receptor binding in these cells. Similarly, it will be of interest to determine if overexpression of SLAP-130 impacts negatively on signal transduction via the IgE receptor. It will be important to determine if the down-regulation of TCR-induced NFAT activation by overexpression of SLAP-130 requires an interaction between SLP-76 and SLAP-130. Experiments are in progress to determine the site on SLAP-130 responsible for its interaction with SLP-76. Manipulation of the SLAP-130 cDNA prior to transfection into Jurkat cells expressing wild type or overexpressed levels of SLP-76 will facilitate our understanding of how these two molecules may interact to regulate signals downstream of TCR engagement."

Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 715-729Google Scholar). Cross-links have been identified within loricrin, elafin, filaggrin, keratin, SPR1, SPR2, and desmoplakin (35Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Google Scholar). Loricrin is present as a partner in most of these cross-links. It has been proposed that envelope formation is initiated with formation of an envelope scaffolding that consists of soluble precursors, and that other precursors (both soluble and insoluble) are later deposited (3Reichert U. Michel S. Schmidt R. Darmon M. Blumenberg M. Molecular Biology of the Skin: The Keratinocyte. Academic Press, Inc., New York1993: 107-149Google Scholar,11Eckert R.L. Yaffe M.B. Crish J.F. Murthy S.

The scaffolding has been proposed to consist of involucrin, cystatin A, and possibly other proteins (25Steinert P.M. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 33-40Google Scholar). In this model, other proteins, including loricrin, elafin, and SPRs, are deposited onto this scaffolding. In the present report, we study the composition of envelopes formed by cultured keratinocytes, as a model of the early stages in cornified envelope formation. We purify envelope fragments from CEs formed in cell culture, digest them sequentially with CNBr, trypsin, and proteinase K, and determine the sequence of the released peptides. Using this procedure, we identify involucrin, PAI-2, keratins, SPR1A and SPR1B, annexin I, desmoplakin I, plakoglobin, envoplakin, plakophilin, desmocolin 3a/3b, desmoglein 3, S100A11 (S100C, calgizzarin), S100A10, and several unidentified proteins as components of the cornified envelope. The SPRs are, by far, the most abundant components released by the digestion protocol. Based on the pattern of fragments released by the enzymatic digestion, we identify the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of S100A11 and the SPRs, and the amino terminus of annexin I as sites of cross-link formation. Cornified envelopes, formed spontaneously or induced to form by treatment with NaCl, were used to prepare highly purified cornified envelope fragments from human foreskin keratinocyte cultures (36Robinson N.A. LaCelle P.T. Eckert R.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 101-107Google Scholar). These envelope fragments were sequentially digested using the scheme shown in Fig. 1. CE fragments (10 mg) were resuspended in 16 ml of 70% formic acid containing 2 g of CNBr and digested, with continuous agitation, for 24 h at room temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged to yield soluble and pellet fractions. The soluble fraction was diluted 5-fold with water and lyophilized to remove CNBr. This was repeated two times. The resulting residue was dissolved in 0.4–1.0 ml of H2O, acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (for this and subsequent acidifications, the final trifluoroacetic acid concentration = 0.2%), and centrifuged to yield soluble and pellet fractions. The soluble fraction (fraction 2) was analyzed using a C-18 HPLC column, and the pellet fraction (fraction 1) was dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer for electrophoresis. The CNBr pellet was washed three times with H2O and resuspended by sonication in 1–2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 11.5 mm CaCl2, and an aliquot was saved for amino acid analysis. The remaining suspension was digested at 1% w/w (based on the initial concentration of CE fragments) with l-(tosylamido-2-phenyl)ethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Worthington) for 24 h at 25 °C with agitation. The material was centrifuged to yield pellet and soluble fractions. The soluble fraction was acidified with trifluoroacetic acid and centrifuged to yield an acid-insoluble pellet and an acid-soluble supernatant. The soluble fraction (fraction 4) was analyzed by HPLC, and the pellet (fraction 3) was resuspended in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. In some cases this pellet was redissolved in proteinase K digestion buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm CaCl2) containing 1 μg of proteinase K and digested for 30 h. After acidification with trifluoroacetic acid and centrifugation, this mixture yielded a pellet (fraction 5) and supernatant (fraction 6). The supernatant (fraction 6) was analyzed by HPLC. The pellet was not analyzed. The pellet from the trypsin digestion was washed with proteinase K digestion buffer, suspended by sonication in 0.5 ml of the same buffer, and an aliquot was removed for amino acid analysis. The remaining sample was digested with 1 μg of proteinase K (Promega) for 30 h. Centrifugation of this reaction mixture yielded a pellet and supernatant. Acidification of the supernatant with trifluoroacetic acid and centrifugation yielded pellet and soluble fractions. The soluble fraction (fraction 8) was analyzed by HPLC and the pellet (fraction 7) was resuspended in Laemmli buffer for gel electrophoresis. Protein concentration of CE fragments was determined using the solid-phase, dot blot assay as described previously (36Robinson N.A. LaCelle P.T. Eckert R.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 101-107Google Scholar). The protein content of the fractions released by the various proteolytic digestions was measured using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit. Soluble peptides released by proteolytic digestion (Fig. 1, #2,#4, #6, and #8) were filtered through a 0.2-μm Uniflo-3 syringe filter (Schleicher & Schuell) and the samples were fractionated on a C18 reverse phase column (Advantage-100, 5 μm, 240 × 4.6 mm, Thomson Liquid Chromatography, Springfield, VA) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peptides eluting during the acetonitrile gradient (gradient conditions indicated in Fig. 3 legend) were monitored at 220 nm using a Waters model 484 absorbance detector (Waters, Milford, MA). Peptides were collected, dried by rotary evaporation, and purified by re-chromatographing on the Advantage C18 column using a shallow acetonitrile gradient (0.1%/min). The purified peptides were concentrated by rotary evaporation and dissolved in 10 μl of 70% acetonitrile containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid for microsequencing. Samples of acid-insoluble, digested envelope fragments (Fig. 1,#1, #3, and #7) were electrophoresed on 10 or 12% polyacrylamide gels (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Proteins were stained using Coomassie Blue or were transferred to PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes and processed for microsequencing as described previously (36Robinson N.A. LaCelle P.T. Eckert R.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 101-107Google Scholar). Purified peptides were sequenced using a Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems Procise model 494 microsequenator. HPLC-purified peptides were applied to a BioBrene-Plus-treated (Applied Biosystems) glassfiber filter prior to sequencing. Polyacrylamide gel-purified peptides were sequenced directly on the excised PVDF membrane. In most cases, 10 sequencing cycles were performed for each peptide. Peptide sequences of >6 amino acids were matched to candidate proteins by searching the non-redundant protein data base using the Blastp facility, 2The Blastp facility is available on the World Wide Web (URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). the Blosum-62 matrix, and an e-value of 10–100. Sequences of 6 or 5 amino acids were similarly analyzed using the PAM 40 matrix at an e-value of 100–1000. Sequences of 4 or 3 amino acids were used to screen a library of candidate CE precursor proteins made in PC Gene (IntelliGenetics, Inc., Mountain View, CA). The proteins in this library were those listed in the section on molecular modeling. Only matches to human protein sequences are reported in this article. CE preparations were analyzed for amino acid composition using an Applied Biosystems 420A derivatizer/analyzer. The % molar data were analyzed by least squares regression analysis essentially as described previously (25Steinert P.M. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 33-40Google Scholar, 26Steven A.C. Steinert P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 693-700Google Scholar). The data were modeled using the following equations. y=Ax+EEquation 1 x is the unknown m-dimensional vector whose jth component is the number of moles of proteinj in the sample, A is the known n× m matrix whose (i,j)th entry is the number of moles of amino acid i in 1 mol of proteinj (n > m and A is full rank), y is the number of moles of amino acidi in the sample, and E is a randomn-dimensional error vector. It is assumed that Ehas mean of zero and covariance Σ. Multiplying Equation 1 byB, the left inverse for A (i.e. am × n matrix satisfying BA =I, where I is the m ×m identity matrix) yields the following equation. By=x+BEEquation 2 The term By defines a random vector with meanx and covariance BΣB T. The protein composition x is estimated by choosing B to minimize the trace covariance, BΣB T, subject to the constraints that BA = I and(By) i ≥ 0 fori = 1, … ,m. The nonnegative constraint was imposed because large negative solutions, which are physiologically irrelevant, were generated without the constraint. Since the number of observations was fairly small, the estimates of sample covariance were unreliable and we used Σ = I. Therefore, the estimate forx is the positive part of the usual least squares estimate. The values calculated from the molar data were converted to percent mass.

Methionine (Met) and tryptophan (Trp) are not considered in the analysis, since Met is destroyed by the CNBr digestion and Trp was not measured. Poly(A)+ RNA, isolated from cultured human foreskin keratinocytes (53Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar), was used as the template to clone a cDNA encoding the human S100A11 protein coding region by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using 5′-CAT ATG GCA AAA ATC TCC AGC CC as the forward primer and 5′-GGA TCC TGA GGT GGT TAG TGT GCT CA (43Tanaka M. Adzuma K. Iwami M. Yoshimoto K. Monden Y. Itakura M. Cancer Lett. 1995; 89: 195-200Google Scholar) as the reverse primer. Poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed in a standard reaction using a RT-PCR kit (Boehringer Mannheim, catalog no. 1483188) and 30 pmol of the reverse primer. One half of this reaction was PCR-amplified using 2.5 units ofPwo polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of 0.5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MgSO4, and 30 pmol of each primer (10 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s; and 15 additional cycles for which the elongation step was increased by 20 s/cycle). The PCR product was blunt end-cloned at the EcoRV site of pZERO1.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and the DNA sequence of both strands was determined using the M13-reverse and T7 promoter primers and an Applied Biosystems model 377 sequencer. Fig. 1 shows the scheme followed for digestion of the purified CE fragments. The strategy was to sequentially digest CE fragments with proteolytic agents and then to sequence the released peptides. At each stage, the residual pellet from the preceding step was digested with the next cleavage agent. The goal was to release smaller peptides at each step. We first cleaved with CNBr. CNBr cleaves at methionine residues, which occur relatively infrequently in proteins. The residual pellet from the CNBr step was treated with trypsin, which cleaves after lysines and arginines, and the pellet from this step was treated with the nonspecific protease, proteinase K. In preparation for HPLC separation of peptide fragments, the released material from each digestion was acidified with trifluoroacetic acid. Addition of trifluoroacetic acid resulted in the precipitation of larger peptides from each sample. The precipitates (fractions 1, 3, and 7) were characterized by gel electrophoresis, while the soluble fractions (fractions 2, 4, 6, and 8) were separated using a C18 HPLC column. Fig. 2 shows the Coomassie Blue-stained profile of a 12% polyacrylamide gel of fractions 1, 3, and 7. The CNBr digestion products, prepared from either spontaneous (S) or induced (I) envelope fragments, yielded a similar pattern of discrete peptide bands. The peptides released following trypsin digestion yielded a smear. In addition, a greater amount of material was released from the induced envelopes compared with the spontaneous envelope preparation (normalized based on the amount of starting CE protein). Proteinase K, in contrast, did not release large peptide fragments from induced envelope fragments; however, some high molecular weight material, which remained at the top of the separatory gel, was released from spontaneous envelope fragments. Table I lists the quantity of protein released, from each major fraction, following sequential digestion of 1 mg of spontaneously formed CE fragments with CNBr, trypsin, and proteinase K. CNBr released 25% of the material, trypsin released 42%, and proteinase K released 18%. The total yield for all steps was 85% of the initial CE protein.Table IYield of protein released by proteolytic digestionFraction1-aFraction nos. refer to Fig. 1; fractions 5 and 6 were not assayed, as they are subsets of fraction 3.Treatment1-bCE envelopes (spontaneously formed) were digested sequentially with CNBr, trypsin, and proteinase K as outlined in Fig. 1and described under “Materials and Methods.”mg protein/mg of CE1-cValues are mean ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab To identify proteins of the cornified envelope, selected CNBr-released peptide fragments (Fig. 2, C1, C2, C3, andC4) were separated by gel electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF membrane, and microsequenced. The sequences were then used to search the nonredundant protein sequence data base to identify each protein. One peptide matched desmoplakin I, and the other three matched segments of annexin I (Table II). A methionine (Met) residue always preceded the sequence, a result that is consistent with release by CNBr. The desmoplakin band (Fig. 2, C1) migrated at 46 kDa in the CNBr digest of spontaneous envelope fragments. It is interesting that this band is virtually absent in the CNBr digest of induced envelope fragments. This observation is in agreement with our previously published report that desmosomal remnants are present in electron micrographs of spontaneous CE fragments but are absent in CE fragments prepared from induced envelopes (36Robinson N.A. LaCelle P.T. Eckert R.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 101-107Google Scholar). The other three peptides (C2, C3, and C4) were all derived from human annexin I. Peptide C2 appears to be a partial digest, since the calculated size of the Val56–Met127 fragment, based on the known sequence (42Wallner B.P. Mattaliano R.J. Hession C. Cate R.L. Tizard R. Sinclair L.K. Foeller C. Chow E.P. Browing J.L. Ramachandran K.L. Pepinsky R.B. Nature. 1986; 320: 77-81Google Scholar), is 7.8 kDa and the molecular mass of C2 is 16.9 kDa. Likewise, peptides C3 and C4 have the same NH2-terminal sequence, but different molecular masses. C4, as judged by Coomassie staining intensity, was the most abundant peptide released by CNBr.Table IIPeptides identified following gel fractionation of fraction 1Peptide2-aIdentification numbers correspond to peptides in Fig.2.CalculatedM r2-bTheoretical molecular weight of the peptide fragment based on known sequence.ApparentM r2-cMolecular weight determined from calibration of the SDS-polyacrylamide gel.SequenceProteinResidues2-dResidues indicate only the portion of the peptide that was sequenced.Quantity2-ePicomoles of peptide detected (by sequencing)/mg of starting CE fragments.pmol/mgC122,00046,000LKSLEDLKLKDesmoplakin I1021–1039124NTKIEVLEEC27,80016,900VKGVDEATIIAnnexin I57–71117DILTKC313,90012,100KGLGTDEDTAnnexin I128–14858LIEILASRTNKEC413,9008,200KGLGTDEDTAnnexin I128–142956LIEILA2-a Identification numbers correspond to peptides in Fig.2.2-b Theoretical molecular weight of the peptide fragment based on known sequence.2-c Molecular weight determined from calibration of the SDS-polyacrylamide gel.2-d Residues indicate only the portion of the peptide that was sequenced.2-e Picomoles of peptide detected (by sequencing)/mg of starting CE fragments. Open table in a new tab The CNBr-released, trifluoroacetic acid-soluble fraction prepared from spontaneous envelope fragments (Fig. 1, #2) was analyzed by C18 HPLC. Since SDS adversely effects the resolution of the HPLC purification, CE fragments were extensively washed with H2O and then CNBr-digested to yield fraction 2. HPLC fractionation of this material revealed a complex profile (Fig.3 A). To assure purity, the indicated peaks, C6–C20, were rechromatographed on the C18 column, using a shallower (0.1%/min) acetonitrile gradient. The samples were then concentrated and sequenced (Table III). In some cases, this second chromatography step resolved the sample into multiple peaks. The additional peaks are indicated by alphabetical extensions (aand b).

Both purified and recombinant core proteins form sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant oligomers, and we now report that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the central region of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain (4V) also oligomerizes. The degree of oligomerization correlates with the previously reported ability to bind protein kinase C (PKC) and regulate its activity. Only multimeric recombinant syndecan-4 core protein, but not the monomeric protein, potentiated the activity of PKCα, and only oligomeric syndecan-4 cytoplasmic peptides were active. Changes in peptide sequence caused parallel loss of stable oligomeric status and ability to regulate a mixture of PKCαβγ activity. A synthetic peptide encompassing the whole cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 (4L) containing a membrane-proximal basic sequence did not form higher order oligomers and could not regulate the activity of PKCαβγ unless induced to aggregate by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Oligomerization and PKC regulatory activity of the 4V peptide were both increased by addition of N-terminal cysteine and reduced by phosphorylation of the cysteine thiol group. Concentration of syndecan-4 at sites of focal adhesion formation may enhance multimerization and both localize PKC and potentiate its activity to induce stable complex formation.

Extracellular matrix molecules such as fibronectin regulate many cellular processes through information encoded in the ligand-receptor interaction. Fibronectin has at least two distinct classes of cell-surface receptors: integrins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Integrins bind at several sites, but adhesion for many cell types is primarily through the classical RGD sequence in the tenth type III repeat of the molecule (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar, 2Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Google Scholar). Clustering of specific integrins by either immobilized extracellular molecules or anti-integrin antibodies has many biological effects (reviewed in Refs.3Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu.

Ligand-induced dimerization or oligomerization is a key event in transmembrane signaling by hormone or growth factor receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. This leads to an increase in tyrosine kinase activity, autophosphorylation of receptors, and the induction of diverse biological responses (13van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev.

Although integrins have no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, it is clear that their clustering is needed prior to subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation events (reviewed in Refs.3Burridge K.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1996; 12: 463-579Google Scholar), which appear to be not only structural complexes but also to have signaling functions. This can be provided by further stimulation with the near C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin (Hep II) (17Woods A. Couchman J.R. Johansson S. Hook M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 665-670Google Scholar), a synthetic peptide from this domain (18Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol.

Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Google Scholar). This causes a redistribution of α5β1 into large clusters in focal adhesions and a concomitant redistribution of the cytoplasmic components vinculin and talin (18Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Google Scholar, 19Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Google Scholar). Circumstantial evidence has indicated that a cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan may transduce the signal from the Hep II domain of fibronectin (reviewed in Ref. 20Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 61: 578-584Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 is one member of the syndecan family of transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans (20Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 61: 578-584Google Scholar, 21Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Google Scholar) that is selectively concentrated in the focal adhesions of a range of cells (22Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Google Scholar) in a PKC-dependent manner (23Baciu P. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1503-1513Google Scholar) and may, therefore, function as a coreceptor with integrins. The four mammalian syndecans all have highly homologous transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, except for a short variable (V) region in the center of the cytoplasmic domain (20Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 61: 578-584Google Scholar, 21Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Google Scholar). The extracellular domains, however, bear little homology. All syndecans form homologous dimers or multimers that resist treatment with SDS (20Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 61: 578-584Google Scholar, 21Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Google Scholar, 22Woods A. Couchman J.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26404-26410Google Scholar) have shown that syndecan-3 core protein assembles into stable, noncovalent multimers mediated by the transmembrane domain and ectodomain flanking region and that this is independent of cysteine residues. Multimerization of syndecan-4 has been seen in biochemical studies (22Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Google Scholar, 24Pierce A. Lyon M. Hampson I.N. Cowling G.J.

Cell. 1994; 5: 1325-1339Google Scholar), and the high concentration of this molecule in focal adhesions (22Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Google Scholar) should favor this. Recently, we showed that syndecan-4 could directly activate PKCα in the absence of phospholipid (PL) and potentiate PL-induced activity (26Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 8133-8136Google Scholar). This ability appears to reside in the central portion of the cytoplasmic domain, which is unique to syndecan-4, based on studies with fusion proteins containing or lacking this region, and with synthetic peptides encompassing this amino acid sequence (26Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 8133-8136Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins capable of activating PKCα were oligomeric, consistent with in vivo data. Preliminary data also suggested that the variable region of syndecan-4 (4V) could also oligomerize. We now report that the degree of oligomerization correlates with the ability to regulate PKCα activity, indicating that clustering of syndecan-4 with ligand may control signaling events. Synthetic peptides with sequences corresponding to regions of the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 or syndecan-2 (see Table I) were synthesized and sequenced by the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Comprehensive Cancer Center Peptide Synthesis and Analysis Shared Facility and analyzed by the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center Mass Spectrometry Shared Facility. Some peptides (e.g. Cys4V) had an additional cysteine at the N terminus. PKCαβγ purified from rabbit brain was purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies (Lake Placid, NY), recombinant PKCα from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), [γ-32P]ATP from DuPont NEN, Sepharose CL-4B and glutathione-agarose beads from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and protein standards for size exclusion chromatography from Bio-Rad. Phosphatidylserine and diolein were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). A peptide encompassing the PKC phosphorylation site in the epidermal growth factor receptor and P-81 phosphocellulose paper were obtained from Biomol Research (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and Whatman, respectively. Antibodies against glutathioneS-transferase (GST) were purchased from Molecular Probes, and reduced glutathione was from Janssen Chimica (New Brunswick, NJ). Sephadex G-50 (Fine), Sephadex G-150 (Fine),N-lauroylsarcosine, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranose, PIP2, inositol hexaphosphate, and other chemicals were all purchased from Sigma.Table IThe amino acid sequences and molecular mass of peptides derived from cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 and syndecan-2PeptideSequenceEstimationGel filtrationSDS-PAGE0 μm Ca2+750 μm Ca2+DakDa4LRMKKKDEGSYDLGKKPIYKKAPTNEFYA32916.96.65.1Cys4LCRMKKKDEGSYDLGKKPIYKKAPTNEFYA33947.46.55.34VLGKKPIYKK10604.64.72.9Cys4VCLGKKPIYKK11638.78.73.2Cys2LCRMRKKDEGSYDLGERKPSSAAYQKAPTKEFYA38543.8N.D.4.2Cys2VCGERKPSSAAYQK14661.8N.D.<3.0Molecular mass was estimated from the deduced amino acid sequence, by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration chromatography at two different concentrations of calcium, or by 20% SDS-PAGE.

A cDNA encoding the entire syndecan-4 core protein or lacking the entire cytoplasmic domain was subcloned into GST expression vector pGEX-5X-1 (Pharmacia) and fusion protein in Escherichia coli induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranose (26Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 8133-8136Google Scholar). Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation for 2 min at 10,000 × g. The pellets were resuspended with TBSE (Tris-buffered saline with EDTA; 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, sonicated on ice for 1 min, and N-lauroylsarcosine was added to a final concentration of 1% in TBSE to solubilize recombinant proteins. After 30 min of incubation on ice, insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were diluted 10 times with TBSE containing 4% Triton X-100 and applied to 0.5-ml pre-equilibrated glutathione-agarose columns. After washing with TBSE containing 4% Triton X-100 to remove unbound materials, the column was washed once with TBSE containing 1% Triton X-100 and once with TBSE containing 0.1% Triton X-100 to decrease the detergent concentration. Fusion proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm reduced glutathione. Purified GST-syndecan-4 fusion proteins were loaded onto Sepharose CL-4B or Sephadex G-150 (0.7 × 100 cm) gel filtration columns pre-equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 0.1% CHAPS, and 150 mmNaCl. Proteins were eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 6 ml/h at room temperature and detected by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The column was calibrated using the protein standards thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.3 kDa). Syndecan-4 peptides were loaded onto Sephadex G-50 gel filtration columns (1.5 × 100 cm, or 0.7 × 100 cm for Fig. 7), and the columns were calibrated with standards comprising carbonic anhydrase (29.0 kDa), equine myoglobin (17.0 kDa), lysozyme (14.3 kDa), aprotinine (6.5 kDa), and vitamin B12(1.3 kDa). Experiments were conducted using either recombinant PKCα or PKCαβγ purified from rabbit brain, with similar results in each case. PKCα or PKCαβγ was incubated in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3) at room temperature for 10 min with or without PL, phosphatidylserine, and diolein and with the different syndecan peptides. These assays monitored the effect of peptides to potentiate PL-induced activation of PKCα or to directly activate the enzyme in the absence of PL. The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 3 mm magnesium acetate, 750 μmCaCl2, 200 μm ATP (0.5 μCi of [32P]ATP), 4 μg of histone III-S, 8 ng of PKCα, 1 μg of peptide, with or without 4 μg of phosphatidylserine and 0.4 μg of diolein. SDS mixture (5×, direct activation) or trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 20%) with 0.1% SDS (potentiation) was added to stop the reaction. Phosphorylation was quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) after electrophoresis on 20% SDS-PAGE. In assays using 0.1 mg/ml of the epidermal growth factor receptor peptide of the sequence RKRTLRRL (Biomol Research) as an alternative substrate (see Fig. 6), the reaction mixture contained PIP2 (50 μm) and/or syndecan-4 peptide (4L; 0.25 mg/ml) in the absence of PL and calcium, and PKCαβγ mixture (3 ng) was used. The reaction was stopped by spotting the whole reaction mixture onto phosphocellulose filters (Whatman, P-81, 2.1 cm) and dropping these into 75 mmphosphoric acid. The phosphocellulose filters were washed three times for 10 min each, immersed in 95% ethanol for 5 min, dried, and counted with 4 ml of scintillation mixture in a scintillation counter (Wallac model 1409). Our previous studies showed that recombinant syndecan-4, in which the core protein formed SDS-resistant oligomers, could increase the ability of PKCα to phosphorylate histone III-S (26Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 8133-8136Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether this multimeric form is critical for its potentiation activity. Gel chromatography of pure preparations of recombinant syndecan-4 on Sepharose CL-4B under nondenaturing conditions showed that the major species had aM r ∼500,000 (Fig.1 A), indicating that the major form of intact syndecan-4 is oligomeric. We could sometimes also detect minor pools ofM r ∼350,000 and ∼230,000 (data not shown). These oligomeric core proteins migrated on SDS-PAGE gels as a single population with apparent M r ∼150,000 (Fig.1 B). Since the deduced molecular mass of the fusion protein is 49 kDa, fusion protein resolves on denaturing gels as oligomers, possibly dimers. Reduction had no effect; the core protein of syndecan-4 in any case contained no cysteine. However, a single freeze-thaw cycle dissociated this oligomeric form into monomeric proteins migrating with M r ∼53,000 on Sephadex G-150 gel chromatography (Fig. 1 A) and ∼50,000 on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1 B). Although multimeric forms of intact syndecan-4 core protein could potentiate PKCα activity to phosphorylate histone III-S (Fig. 1 C; compare lanes 1 and 2), monomeric forms of syndecan-4 core protein did not have this activity (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 1 and 3). Similar potentiation was seen with both purified PKCαβγ mixture and recombinant PKCα (data not shown). As reported previously, mutants of syndecan-4 with partially or totally truncated cytoplasmic domains could not increase PKCα activity, although they did form oligomers (26Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 8133-8136Google Scholar). A peptide from this domain was also active (26Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 8133-8136Google Scholar). Since oligomerization of the core protein was needed for PKC regulatory activity, we monitored whether synthetic peptides with sequences from the cytoplasmic domain could oligomerize and if this correlated with the ability to regulate PKC activity. The apparent molecular masses of syndecan-4 peptides encompassing the whole cytoplasmic domain (4L) or just the variable region unique to syndecan-4 (4V) as estimated by Sephadex G-50 gel chromatography are larger than predicted (Table I). Peptide 4L eluted close to putative dimeric size, whereas 4V eluted as a tetramer. Therefore, with respect to syndecan-4, two sites in the core protein are involved in oligomerization: the transmembrane and/or ectodomains as shown for syndecan-3 (25Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26404-26410Google Scholar), and the central region of its cytoplasmic domain. However, the highly basic region of syndecan-4 proximal to the membrane from the V region appears to limit self-association of 4L compared with 4V in the absence of phospholipid (see below). In agreement with a need for oligomerization for PKCαβγ regulatory activity, 4V but not 4L could potentiate PL-induced activation of PKCαβγ to phosphorylate histones (Fig.2 A) and directly activate PKCαβγ in the absence of PL (Fig. 2 B). Equivalent syndecan-2 peptides, which lack PKC regulatory activity (26Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 8133-8136Google Scholar), were also examined, since syndecan-2 is the closest homologue to syndecan-4 but lacks the required cytoplasmic sequence for PKC regulation (20Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 61: 578-584Google Scholar, 21Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Google Scholar, 26Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 8133-8136Google Scholar). Both gel chromatography and SDS-PAGE indicated a lack of apparent oligomerization of syndecan-2 peptide (Table I), confirming the unique ability of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain to self-associate. GST fusion proteins containing the whole syndecan-2 core protein, however, do migrate with similar properties to syndecan-4 on SDS-PAGE gels, confirming the general ability of syndecan core proteins to self-associate (data not shown). Taken together, the results show that although transmembrane regions of syndecans promote SDS-resistant oligomer formation (putative dimers), further oligomerization to form tetramers or higher oligomers, as seen with 4V peptides and whole syndecan-4 fusion proteins, is required for PKCαβγ (or PKCα) activation. We tested whether the addition of cysteine to the N terminus of 4V and 4L peptides could induce higher order clustering and concomitantly increase PKCαβγ or PKCα regulatory activity. Cys4V eluted at 8.7 kDa (Table I), indicative of an octamer, even though electrospray ionization mass spectrometry showed the molecular mass as 1.1 kDa (data not shown). 2The mass spectrometer was purchased (National Institutes of Health Grant S10RR06487) and operated by the Comprehensive Cancer Center Mass Spectrometry Shared Facility, University of Alabama at Birmingham (supported in part by National Cancer Institute Grant P30CA13148). Thus, the N-terminal cysteine on Cys4V may aid V region multimerization. This had no statistically significant effect on the ability of 4V to potentiate PL-induced PKCαβγ activity (Fig. 2 A), but direct activation of PKCαβγ by Cys4V (i.e. in the absence of PL) was greater than that seen with 4V (Fig. 2 B). In the presence of PL, both 4V and Cys4V could potentiate the normally maximal activity by 4-fold. In the absence of PL, when PKCαβγ is normally inactive, 4V and Cys4V caused 1.7- and 3.0-fold direct activation. In contrast, Cys4L, having cysteine at the N terminus of 4L, still eluted at 7.4 kDa as a dimer (Table I) and was no more active in regulating PKCαβγ activity than 4L (Fig. 2). Calcium concentrations can affect protein-protein interactions, and phosphorylation experiments were performed in 750 μm calcium to maximize PKCαβγ activity (28Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-310Google Scholar). However, gel filtration at this calcium concentration did not affect the multimeric status of the peptides (Table I). These multimeric peptides were resistant to SDS, although the apparentM r on SDS-PAGE was lower than that seen by gel filtration, being only 1.5- to 3-fold that deduced from the amino acid sequence (Table I). For example, both 4V and Cys4V migrated with an apparent M r ∼3000. Both methods of estimation depend on the secondary structure of the molecules tested, with gel filtration being less denaturing. Further control experiments with 2V and 2L peptides showed that N-terminal cysteine residues did not induce their oligomerization (Table I). The results so far indicate that 1) syndecan-4 core protein multimerization correlates with PKC potentiation; 2) the V region of the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 can itself form homopolymers as does recombinant core protein; 3) multimerization is independent of calcium concentration; 4) dimerization is not sufficient for PKCαβγ regulatory activity since 4L is inactive; and 5) tetrameric 4V is sufficient for potentiation of PL-induced PKCαβγ activity, but direct activation of PKCαβγ is more effective with octameric forms seen with Cys4V. When incubated with PKCαβγ and [32P]ATP in the absence of PL, Cys4V, but not 4V, was itself phosphorylated even though it lacks serine or threonine amino acids (Table I, Fig. 3 A). Although the phosphorylation of peptide Cys4V was 10-fold less than that of histone III-S, it was time-dependent (Fig. 3 A). Since 4V was not phosphorylated, Cys4V phosphorylation may be on cysteine thiol groups (29Guan K. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Google Scholar). To investigate whether this phosphorylation affected the direct activation of PKCαβγ by Cys4V, peptides Cys4V, 4V, or 4L were “cold-phosphorylated” by preincubation with PKCαβγ and ATP in the absence of PL (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4–6). Their capacities to subsequently activate PKCαβγ were compared with those of peptides similarly incubated with PKCαβγ but without ATP (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–3). Minimal histone phosphorylation by PKCαβγ was seen in the presence of 4L (lane 1), and this was slightly reduced following incubation with cold ATP and PKCαβγ (lane 4). Peptide 4V promoted histone phosphorylation to a similar extent with (lane 5) or without (lane 2) pretreatment. In contrast, the ability of Cys4V to promote histone phosphorylation (lane 3) was markedly reduced (lane 6) by preincubation with ATP and PKCαβγ. Thus, preincubation of Cys4V with cold ATP and PKCαβγ caused a loss of ability to activate PKCαβγ. To determine whether phosphorylation of Cys4V altered its oligomeric structure, we incubated Cys4V with PKCαβγ ± 200 μmcold ATP for 10 min at 37 °C and analyzed the peptide by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 4). Cys4V and 4V maintained their original elution profiles (8.7 and 4.6 kDa, respectively) in the absence of enzyme, but elution of phosphorylated Cys4V was markedly altered, with a minor population eluting at 8.7 kDa as before, but most at 3.9 kDa. Thus, phosphorylation appeared to cause a reduction in the multimeric nature of Cys4V, paralleling a loss in its ability to directly activate PKCαβγ. A further control experiment was performed to analyze whether cysteine thiol group phosphorylation itself was inhibitory independent of peptide multimerization. To do this, peptides based on syndecan 4V sequence (CLGKRPIYRK or CLGKKPIFKK, where two lysine residues were substituted with arginine or the tyrosine residue was substituted with phenylalanine) were used. These were inactive in regulating PKC activity (26Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 8133-8136Google Scholar) but could be readily phosphorylated. These peptides, when phosphorylated as described above, had no effect on the subsequent ability of “wild type” Cys4V to activate PKCαβγ (data not shown). Therefore, reducing the oligomerization status of Cys4V peptide was directly related to decreased PKCαβγ regulation.Figure 4Preincubation in the presence of PKCαβγ and cold ATP reduces the apparent mass of Cys4V. The molecular mass of 4V or Cys4V was analyzed by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration column chromatography before (□, 4V; ○, Cys4V) or after (▪, 4V; •, Cys4V) preincubation in the presence of PKCαβγ and cold ATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown before, the sequence KPIYK is critical in the up-regulation of PKC activity (26Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 8133-8136Google Scholar). This sequence is present in both syndecan 4V and 4L, but 4L activated PKCαβγ much less than 4V. Although this appears to parallel multimerization status, it was also possible that the highly basic membrane-proximal region of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain (Table I) could directly inhibit the effects of 4V. This was ruled out by addition of five times excess of 4L or of 2L, the latter having no ability to regulate PKCαβγ but possessing a highly homologous membrane-proximal sequence. These had no effect on potentiation of PL-induced PKCαβγ activity by 4V (Fig.5 A) or on direct activation of PKCαβγ by Cys4V"

Because the activation of effectors as phospholipase C (PLC) coupled to G-proteins is the early event in the signal transduction pathway leading to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation and to [Ca2+]i increase, we described different PLC isoforms (β1, β2, γ1, and γ2, but not β4) in female rat osteoblasts using Western immunoblotting. The data showed that phospholipase C β was involved in the mobilization of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum of Fura-2-loaded confluent osteoblasts by calcitriol and 17β estradiol, and PLC γ was ineffective. The data also showed that only a PLC β1 linked to a Pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein and a PLC β2 coupled to a Pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein are involved in the effects of calcitriol and 17β estradiol on the mobilization of Ca2+from intracellular Ca2+ stores. In conclusion, these results may be an important step toward understanding membrane effects of these steroids and may be an additional argument in favor of membrane receptors to steroid hormones.

In conclusion, these results may be an important step toward understanding membrane effects of these steroids and may be an additional argument in favor of membrane receptors to steroid hormones. An increase in the turnover of inositol lipids in response to receptor is one of the most important molecular mechanisms used by cells for transmembrane signaling. The initial event is the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, a reaction catalyzed by a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC), 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; [Ca2+]i, cytosolic free Ca2+concentration; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PTX, Pertussis toxin; calcitriol, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or 1,25(OH)2D3. which generates two intracellular second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol (1Martin T.F.J.

Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 263: 1530-1534Google Scholar) and mobilizes intracellular calcium, whereas diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C (6Nishizuka Y. Science. 1984; 308: 693-698Google Scholar), which results in increased phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Molecular cloning has revealed at least three major families of PLC, β, γ, and δ (7Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Google Scholar, 8Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 349-369Google Scholar, 9Anderson D. Koch C.A. Greg L. Ellis C. Moran M.F. Pawson T. Science. 1990; 250: 797-802Google Scholar). Each of these families occurs in a number of isoforms. The enzymes are classified on the basis of their size and their immunological and structural similarities. The PLC isoforms have two highly conserved domains, X and Y, which form the active site of the protein. PLC δ and PLC γ proteins differ from PLC β in that they have shorter C-terminal extensions past the end of the Y domain (9Anderson D. Koch C.A. Greg L. Ellis C. Moran M.F. Pawson T. Science. 1990; 250: 797-802Google Scholar). This diversity among the PLC isoforms also extends to distinct mechanisms of regulation and function for the three PLC families. PLC γ is regulated via the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues between the X and Y domains by receptor tyrosine kinases (10Downing J.R. Margolis B.L. Zilberstein A. Ashmun R.A. Ullrich A. Sherr C.J. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3345-3350Google Scholar, 11Huckle W.R. Hepler J.R. Rhee S. Harden T.K. Earp H.S. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1697-1705Google Scholar, 12Kim J. Sim S.S. Kim U.H. Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Carpenter G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3940-3943Google Scholar). PLC β enzymes, of which there are four isoforms, PLC β1–4, are regulated via heterotrimeric G-proteins in response to an agonist binding to a receptor (13Blank J.L. Ross A.H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18206-18216Google Scholar, 14Cockcorft S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 75-78Google Scholar, 15Fain J.N. Wallace M.A. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2574-2589Google Scholar). The way in which PLC γ is regulated is not yet known, but enzyme activity is not affected by either the G-protein subunits or by receptor tyrosine kinases (16Kriz R. Lin L.L. Sultzman L. Ellis C. Heldin C.H. Pawson T. Knopf J. Bock G. Marsh J. Proto-oncogenes in Cell Development: Ciba Foundation Symposium. John Wiley, Chichester, England1990: 112-127Google Scholar). The activation of molecules as PLC is an early event in the signal transduction pathways leading to a variety of cellular responses, including metabolism, proliferation, secretion, and motility. We have shown that estrogens (17Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1365-1376Google Scholar) and calcitriol (18Lieberherr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13168-13173Google Scholar, 19Grosse B. Bourdeau A. Lieberherr M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1059-1069Google Scholar), the hormonally active form of vitamin D, increase the concentration of intracellular calcium within 5 s by mobilizing calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. This process involves the activation of a phospholipase C linked to a Pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein for estradiol (17Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1365-1376Google Scholar) and an as yet uncharacterized G-protein for calcitriol (20Bourdeau A. Atmani F. Grosse B. Lieberherr M. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2738-2743Google Scholar). However, no information is presently available on the PLC present in osteoblasts, the cells responsible for osteogenesis, or about the PLC isotypes involved in the membrane effects of calcitriol and estradiol. We have therefore described PLC isoforms in the osteoblasts of female rats. We have also identified the PLC isoenzymes involved in the rapid actions of calcitriol and 17β estradiol on the mobilization of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum. The ECL kit and Fura-2/AM were from Amersham Corp. Polyclonal rabbit anti-PLC antibodies to PLC β1, PLC β2, PLC β3, PLC β4, PLC γ1, and PLC γ2 and antigens raised against PLC β1, PLC β2, PLC β3, PLC γ1, and PLC γ2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and Tebu (Le Perray en Yvelines, France), and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Bio-Rad (Ivry sur Seine, France). 1,25(OH)2D3 was from Hoffman-La Roche (Bazel, Switzerland), and 17β estradiol was from Sigma. α-Minimum essential medium without phenol red and fetal calf serum were from Eurobio (Paris, France). Two-day-old female Wistar rats were from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (St Aubin les Elbeufs, France). Osteoblasts were isolated from parietal bones of the newborn rats by sequential enzymatic digestion (21Wong G. Cohn D.V. Nature. 1974; 252: 713-715Google Scholar). These cells had the following osteoblast characteristics: high alkaline phosphatase activity, high type I collagen synthesis, a cAMP and intracellular calcium response to parathyroid hormone, and an osteocalcin response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Cells were grown on rectangular glass coverslips or in Petri dishes (100 cm2) for 4 days in phenol red-free α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells were then incubated for 72 h in phenol red-free medium containing 1% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and transferred to serum-free medium 24 h before use. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, then scraped off into ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 0.6 mmpepstatin, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mmleupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.125 mm aprotinin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cells were sonicated on ice (twice for 20 s at 40 KHz) and the homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 600 × g to remove nuclei. The remaining homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant (cytosol fraction) was saved. The pellet containing the plasma membranes was resuspended in extraction buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (w/w), left on ice for 60 min, and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting supernatant (solubilized membrane fraction) was collected. All fractions (homogenate without nuclei, cytosol, and membrane) were stored at −80 °C. The brain was used as a positive control, because the cerebellum is rich in PLC β3, PLC β4 and PLC γ2, whereas the cerebral ventricules are rich in PLC β1, PLC β2 and PLC γ1 (22Tanaka O. Kondo H. Neuroci. Lett. 1994; 82: 17-20Google Scholar). Extracts of these two tissues were treated in the same way as the osteoblast homogenate. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Alkaline phosphatase activity, as an enzyme marker of the plasma membrane, was assayed as described by Lieberherr et al. (24Lieberherr M. Vreven J. Vaes G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 293: 160-169Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% resolving gel) in 25 mm Tris-base, pH 8.3, 192 mmglycine, 0.1% SDS (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). They were then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Immobilon P) in the same buffer with 20% ethanol for 2 h at 100 V (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding to nitrocellulose was prevented by incubating the membranes in 50 mm Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5% skim milk powder, and 0.05% Tween 20 for 12 h at 4 °C. The membranes were given washes in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and were incubated overnight at 4 °C with isoenzyme-specific polyclonal rabbit antibodies (PLC β1, PLC β2, PLC β3, PLC β4, PLC γ1, and PLC γ2). The concentrations of PLC antibodies in TBS, 1.5% skim milk, 0.1% Tween 20 were as follows: 0.1 μg/ml for PLC β1, 0.5 μg/ml for PLC β2, 1 μg/ml for PLC β3, 0.5 μg/ml for PLC β4, 0.5 μg/ml for PLC γ1, and 1 μg/ml for PLC γ2. Unbound antibodies were removed by four washes with TBS, 0.1% Tween 20; the antibodies bound to nitrocellulose were detected using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1 mg/ml) (diluted 1/5000 in TBS, 1.5% skim milk, 0.1% Tween 20). The antigen was detected by ECL. The molecular size standards used for calculating the apparent molecular mass of the PLCs were: ovalbumin, 48 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 87 kDa; β galactosidase, 120 kDa; and myosin, 199 kDa. In some experiments, the specificity of the antibodies was verified by incubating these antibodies at room temperature for 2 h with the corresponding peptide (antibody:peptide ratio, 1:10 or 1:100 for Santa Cruz Biotechnologies antibodies, according to the specifications of the manufacturer) prior to use. The film were scanned with Scanjet II CX/T (Hewlett-Packard) and labeled bands were quantified using Image Quant NT software (PhosphorImager SI, Molecular Dynamics). The cells were washed with Hanks' HEPES, pH 7.4 (137 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 0.441 mmKH2PO4, 0.442 mmNa2HPO4, 0.885 mmMgSO4·7H2O, 27.7 mm glucose, 1.25 mm CaCl2, and 25 mm HEPES), and loaded with 1 μm Fura-2/AM for 30 min in the same buffer at room temperature. The glass coverslip carrying the cells was inserted into a cuvette containing 2.5 ml of Hanks' HEPES, pH 7.4. The cuvette was placed in a thermostatted (37 °C) Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer. Drugs and reagents were added directly to the cuvette with continuous stirring. The Fura-2 fluorescence response to the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was calibrated from the ratio of the 340/380 nm fluorescence values after subtraction of the background fluorescence of the cells at 340 and 380 nm as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (27Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar). The dissociation constant for the Fura-2-Ca2+ complex was taken as 224 nm. The values for R max and R minwere calculated from measurements using 25 μm digitonin, 4 mm EGTA, and enough Tris base to raise the pH to 8.3 or higher. Each measurement on Fura-2-loaded cells was followed by a parallel experiment under the same conditions with non-Fura-2-loaded cells. The direct effects of 100 pm calcitriol and estradiol on [Ca2+]i were tested because this concentration of steroids causes a maximal increase in [Ca2+]i in confluent female osteoblasts (18Lieberherr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13168-13173Google Scholar, 17Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1365-1376Google Scholar). Confluent female osteoblasts were then permeabilized for 5 min with 50 μg/ml saponin in the presence of anti-PLC antibody or nonimmune rabbit serum, used at 10 times the concentration used for Western blotting. Cells were washed twice to remove saponin and incubated with the anti-PLC antibody or nonimmune rabbit serum for 1 h at 37 °C. 1 μmFura-2/AM was added for the last 20 min of incubation. In some experiments, anti-PLC β1 and anti-PLC β2 antibodies were set up in competition with the antigens against which they were produced or with the antigens corresponding to the other anti-PLC antibodies for 2 h at room temperature (antibody:peptide ratio, 1:10 or 1:100 for Santa Cruz Biotechnologies antibodies, according to the specifications of the manufacturer) prior to use. The G-protein involved in the actions of calcitriol and estradiol was characterized by incubating cells with 100 ng/ml Pertussis toxin (PTX) for 16 h. Fura-2/AM loading and [Ca2+]i measurements were carried out with the toxin. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Treatment pairs were compared by Dunnett's method. A value of n represents n different cultures for a specific experiment. Calcitriol and 17β estradiol were dissolved in ethanol; the final concentration of ethanol in the medium never exceeded 0.01%. This concentration of ethanol was without effect on intracellular calcium concentration (data not shown). Table I shows the distribution of alkaline phosphatase activity in the subcellular fractions of osteoblasts and brain. Alkaline phosphatase was mostly in the plasma membrane fractions of osteoblasts and brain, because alkaline phosphatase is a membrane-bound enzyme (28Moss D.W. Clin. Chem. 1992; 38: 2486-2492Google Scholar).Table IIntracellular distribution of alkaline para-nitrophenyl phosphataseTissue or cellNo. of experimentsAlkaline phosphatase activityHomogenateMembrane1-aResults are the means ± S.E. for six separate experiments and are significantly different from homogenate and cytosol; p < 0.001.

The linear range of protein concentrations on ECL Western blots was 5–50 μg of proteins. All Western blots were done with 35 μg of proteins of each subcellular fraction for each tissue or cell. Western blotting showed a 150-kDa immunoreactive band in soluble and membrane fractions of brain and osteoblasts using the PLC β1 antibody (Fig. 1). Most of the PLC β1 immunoreactivity was in the membrane fraction of osteoblasts and in the soluble fraction of brain (Fig.2). Immunoblots probed with the PLC β2 antibody showed a 163-kDa immunoreactive band in osteoblasts and cerebellum (Fig. 1), which was mainly in the osteoblast and cerebellum membrane fractions (Fig. 2). There was a 153-kDa immunoreactive band in soluble and particulate fractions of brain and osteoblasts using the PLC β3 antibody (Fig. 1), mainly in the cytosolic fractions in both brain and osteoblasts (Fig. 2 C). PLC β4 with an apparent molecular mass of 160 kDa was mainly in the membrane fraction of brain, but no immunoreactive band for PLC β4 was found in osteoblasts whatever the protein (35–100 μg) concentration and the anti-PLC antibody (0.5–5 μg/ml) concentration (Fig. 1) (data shown for 35 μg in Fig. 2). Immunoblots probed with the PLC γ1 antibody showed a 156-kDa immunoreactive band mostly in the cytosolic fractions of brain and osteoblasts (Figs. 1 and 2). Immunoblots with the PLC γ2 antibody revealed a 145-kDa immunoreactive band in both tissues. Although the signal intensities for this isoenzyme in the two subcellular fractions of the brain were the same, the greatest signal was obtained from the membrane fraction of osteoblasts (Figs. 1 and 2).Figure 2Subcellular distributions of the PLC isoforms in confluent female rat osteoblasts and female rat brain. The film were scanned using a Scanjet II CX/T, and the labeled bands (H, homogenate; Mb, membrane; C, cytosol) were quantified using Image Quant NT software. Density is expressed in arbitrary units.

This also showed that each of the antibodies was using its intended target isoform. The basal intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in confluent female rat osteoblasts was 135 ± 5 nm (mean ± S.E.; n = 6). Pretreament of the cells with saponin for 5 min followed by incubation for 60 min with the anti-PLC antibody in the absence of saponin did not alter the basal [Ca2+]i. Nonimmune serum did not alter the basal [Ca2+]i or the [Ca2+]i response to the steroids. Fig. 3 shows the transient increase (Δ[Ca2+]i = 160 ± 5 nm, mean ± S.E.; n = 6; p < 0.001) in [Ca2+]i induced by 100 pmcalcitriol, which is the concentration of calcitriol that has the most effect on this parameter (18Lieberherr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13168-13173Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i dropped rapidly after 15 s but remained above the basal level (21 ± 2%, mean ± S.E.; n = 6; p < 0.001). The calcitriol-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was partly inhibited by anti-PLC β1 antibody (Fig. 3 A). The residual increase was due to a Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium because this remaining increase was totally blocked by preincubating the cells for 30 s with 2 mm EGTA (18Lieberherr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13168-13173Google Scholar). On the other hand, the antibodies to PLC β2, PLC β3, PLC γ1, or PLC γ2 did not block the effect of calcitriol on [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3,B and C). Fig. 4 shows the transient increase (Δ[Ca2+]i = 130 ± 4 nm, mean ± S.E.; n = 6; p < 0.001) in [Ca2+]i induced by 100 pm 17β estradiol, which is the concentration of estradiol that has most effect on this parameter (17Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1365-1376Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i dropped rapidly after 15 s but remained above the basal level (19 ± 1%, mean ± S.E.; n = 6; p < 0.001). The estradiol-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was partly inhibited by the anti-PLC β2 antibody (Fig. 4 A). The residual increase was due to a Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium because this remaining increase was totally blocked by preincubating the cells for 30 s with 2 mmEGTA (17Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1365-1376Google Scholar). But anti-PLC β1, anti-PLC β3, anti-PLC γ1, and anti-PLC γ2 antibodies did not block the effect of estradiol on [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4, B andC). Polyclonal anti-PLC β1 and anti-PLC β2 antibodies were incubated for 2 h with their corresponding antigens or with the antigens used for producing the anti-PLC β3, anti-PLCγ1, and anti-PLCγ2 antibodies (antibody:antigen ratio, 1:10 or 1:100) before use. The inhibition of the calcitriol-induced increase in [Ca2+]i due to the anti-PLC β1 antibody totally disappeared only when the anti-PLC β1 antibody was co-incubated with its antigen but not with the antigens corresponding to PLC β2, PLC β3, PLC γ1, or PLCγ2. Only the co-incubation with the PLC β2 antigen blocked the inhibition observed with the anti-PLC β2 antibody on the estradiol-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. This occurred when the antigen was used at 100 times the concentration used for the corresponding antibody (data not shown). Preincubation of the cells for 16 h with Pertussis toxin did not alter the basal [Ca2+]i or the [Ca2+]i response to 1 pm-10 nm calcitriol (data not shown). In contrast, PTX partly blocked the response to 100 pm estradiol (Fig. 5). The residual increase disappeared when cells were incubated with 2 mm EGTA. This is, to our knowledge, the first study showing a direct involvement of phospholipase C β in the membrane actions of calcitriol or 17β estradiol in confluent female rat osteoblasts; PLC γ is ineffective. The data also indicate that only PLC β1 linked to a Pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein and a PLC β2 coupled to a Pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein are involved in the effects of calcitriol and 17β estradiol, respectively, on the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores. Female rat osteoblasts possess several isoforms of PLC: β1, β2, β3, γ1, and γ2, as shown by Western immunoblotting. Confluent female rat osteoblasts do not possess PLC β4, which is present in the cerebellum (22Tanaka O. Kondo H. Neuroci. Lett. 1994; 82: 17-20Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3). This suggests that this isoenzyme may have a tissue and cellular specificity or that the gene encoding PLC β4 is posttranscriptionally regulated. The gene may be expressed during the logarithmic phase of proliferation and not when the cells are confluent, corresponding to the differentiation of osteoblasts, or the gene may not be expressed in cells during proliferation and differentiation. These possibilities can be checked by in situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis of osteoblasts at different stages of maturation. Most of the PLC β1 and PLC β2 in mature confluent osteoblasts is linked to the plasma membrane, whereas most PLC β3 is in the cytosol. PLC β1 and PLC β3 are predominantly in the cytosol of brain, whereas PLC β2 is in the plasma membrane. The relationship between membrane-bound and cytosolic PLC β is controversial (29Jackwoski S. Rettenmier C.W. Snyderman R. Science. 1986; 232: 97-100Google Scholar, 30Baldassare J.J. Fisher G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11942-11944Google Scholar, 31Litosch I. Fain J.N. Kuo J.F. Phospholipids and Cellular Regulation. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 159-179Google Scholar). It is not clear whether they are distinct enzymes or whether the same enzyme is distributed between the two intracellular pools. It is generally believed that only the membrane-bound enzyme is involved in receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositol metabolism. Our finding that PLC β enzymes are distributed between soluble and membrane-bound subcellular fractions in osteoblasts indicates that the membrane-bound and cytosolic PLC β is the same enzyme. This is corroborated by our immunocytochemical data showing that PLC β1 and β2 are mostly membraneous, whereas PLC β3 is cytosolic in osteoblasts. 2V. Le Mellay, B. Grosse, and M. Lieberherr, unpublished data. The differential distribution of the enzymes may be a way of regulating enzyme activity that is comparable to the regulation of protein kinase C (6Nishizuka Y. Science. 1984; 308: 693-698Google Scholar, 32Rasmussen H. Isales C.M. Calle R. Throckmorton D. Anderson M. Gasalla-Herraiz J. McCarthy R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 649-681Google Scholar) rather than an artifactual redistribution of the enzyme due to cell homogenization. The presence of PLC γ in osteoblasts is not surprising because these osteogenic cells respond to growth factors that possess tyrosine kinase domains (33Marschall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar). We have previously shown that 17β estradiol and calcitriol rapidly (within 5 s) increase the intracellular calcium concentration by mobilizing Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (17Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1365-1376Google Scholar, 18Lieberherr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13168-13173Google Scholar) and by forming inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate via a phospholipase C (17Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1365-1376Google Scholar, 19Grosse B. Bourdeau A. Lieberherr M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1059-1069Google Scholar,20Bourdeau A. Atmani F. Grosse B. Lieberherr M. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2738-2743Google Scholar). Anti-PLC β1 and anti-PLC β2 antibodies inhibit the steroid-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in much the same way as do direct or indirect inhibitors of PLC (17Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1365-1376Google Scholar, 19Grosse B. Bourdeau A. Lieberherr M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1059-1069Google Scholar). Anti-PLC antibodies, like PLC inhibitors (17Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1365-1376Google Scholar, 19Grosse B. Bourdeau A. Lieberherr M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1059-1069Google Scholar), block only the part of the increase in [Ca2+]i that is due to the mobilization of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, the inhibition of the enzyme activity by anti-PLC antibodies totally disappears in competitive experiments when polyclonal PLC β1 and PLC β2 antibodies and the antigens they were raised against are used but not when the antigens corresponding to the other PLCs are used. This type of enzyme inhibition by selective antibodies against phosphoinositide-specific PLC has also been demonstrated in fresh bovine erythrocytes (34Kuppe A. Hedberg K.K. Volwerk J.J. Griffith O.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1047: 41-48Google Scholar). One explanation of the noninhibiting effects of the other anti-PLC antibodies on the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by the steroids may be that most antibodies do not classically inhibit enzyme activity. On the other hand, because the inhibition by the anti-PLC β1 and anti-PLC β2 antibodies can be reversed only by their antigens, the possible blockade of the activity of the other isoenzymes by their respective antibodies cannot be excluded. The inhibitory effect of polyclonal antibodies against PLC β1 or PLC β2 may be best explained by one of two hypotheses: (i) inhibition of the enzyme activity may result from a stereochemical effect of the binding of the antibody to an epitope at or near the active site of the enzyme; or (ii) alternatively, binding of the antibody to a site remote from the active site in three-dimensional space may lead to a conformational change of the enzyme, rendering it incapable of substrate binding or hydrolysis. It is clear, however, that the anti-PLC β antibody binds to a site of the enzyme that is critical to maintaining the correct geometry of the active site. Further studies are needed to distinguish between these hypotheses, and it will be of interest to identify the site on the PLC protein recognized by the inhibitory antibodies. It is very likely that only PLC βs are involved in the membrane action of these steroids because only PLC β types may be regulated via heterotrimeric G-proteins in response to agonists binding to receptors (1Martin T.F.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 329-345Google Scholar, 7Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Google Scholar, 8Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 349-369Google Scholar). This study shows that the PLC β1 involved in the membrane action of calcitriol is linked to a Pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein, whereas the PLC β2 implicated in the membrane effect of estradiol is coupled to a Pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. The heterotrimeric G-proteins, which transduce a signal from a hormone-bound receptor to a variety of downstream effectors, form a large family of homologous proteins classified according to the amino acid sequence of their α-subunits (35Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Google Scholar, 36Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautum N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Google Scholar, 37Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-120Google Scholar). G-proteins have been divided into two types based on their sensitivity to the Bordella PTX (7Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Google Scholar, 36Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautum N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Google Scholar). The PTX-sensitive G-proteins are inactivated by ADP-ribosylation on the α-subunit and include the members of the Gi and Go family. The PTX-insensitive G-proteins, which are resistant to ADP-ribosylation, belong to the Gq class of G-proteins. The Gq class of G-proteins, including Gαq, Gα11, Gα14, Gα15, and Gα16, can activate all four PLC β isoforms (38Smrcka A.V. Helper J.R. Brown K.O. Strenweis P.C. Science. 1991; 251: 804-807Google Scholar, 39Taylor S.J. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Exton J.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 516-518Google Scholar, 40Wu D. Lee H.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Google Scholar, 41Jhon D.Y. Lee H.H. Park D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6654-6661Google Scholar), but receptor activation of PLC β via G-proteins occurs by both Pertussis toxin-sensitive and Pertussis toxin-insensitive signaling pathway. It is now clear that the α-subunits of the Gq family mediate the toxin-insensitive pathway, but the nature of the G-proteins mediating the toxin-sensitive pathway is not clear. There is no direct evidence that phospholipase C can be activated by the α-subunits of Gi or Go (42Boyer J.L. Graber S.G. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2814-2819Google Scholar), but the recent discovery that G-protein βγ-subunits can activate PLC suggests an alternative mechanism (41Jhon D.Y. Lee H.H. Park D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6654-6661Google Scholar, 42Boyer J.L. Graber S.G. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2814-2819Google Scholar, 43Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol.

Because calcitriol uses a Pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway coupled to PLC β1 and estradiol uses a Pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway linked to a PLC β2, the next step will be to describe the G-proteins and the kind of subunits involved in the membrane action of these steroids. Neither PLC β3 nor PLC β4 is involved in the signal transduction. Similarly, PLCs γ1 and γ2 take no part in the membrane effects of the two steroids as expected because PLC γ enzymes are substrates for growth factor receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (45Canalis E. Lorenzo J. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 52-58Google Scholar). Finally, these results, showing that both calcitriol and estradiol use PLC β to increase the intracellular calcium concentration via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation (17Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1365-1376Google Scholar, 19Grosse B. Bourdeau A. Lieberherr M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1059-1069Google Scholar), may be an important step toward understanding the membrane effects of these steroids. These PLC β enzymes are also linked to two classes of G-proteins, one insensitive to Pertussis toxin, as for calcitriol, the other linked to a Pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein, as for estradiol. These findings may be an additional argument in favor of membrane receptors for steroid hormones (46Pappas T.C. Gametchu B. Watson C.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 404-410Google Scholar, 47Gametchu B.

https://openalex.org/W2025144653,"We have previously shown that mutations in the<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae BSD2</i> gene suppress oxidative damage in cells lacking superoxide dismutase and also lead to hyperaccumulation of copper ions. We demonstrate here that<i>bsd2</i> mutant cells additionally accumulate high levels of cadmium and cobalt. By biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy, BSD2 exhibited localization to the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that BSD2 acts at a distance to inhibit metal uptake from the growth medium. This BSD2 control of ion transport occurs independently of the CTR1 and FET4 metal transport systems. Genetic suppressor analysis revealed that hyperaccumulation of copper and cadmium in <i>bsd2</i> mutants is mediated through<i>SMF1</i>, previously shown to encode a plasma membrane transporter for manganese. A nonsense mutation removing the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain of SMF1 was found to mimic a<i>smf1</i> gene deletion by eliminating the copper and cadmium toxicity of <i>bsd2</i> mutants and also by precluding the<i>bsd2</i> suppression of superoxide dismutase deficiency. However, inactivation of <i>SMF1</i> did not eliminate the elevated cobalt levels in <i>bsd2</i> mutants. Instead, this cobalt accumulation was found to be specifically mediated through the<i>SMF1</i> homologue, <i>SMF2</i>. Hence, BSD2 prevents metal hyperaccumulation by exerting negative control over the SMF1 and SMF2 metal transport systems."
https://openalex.org/W2054004023,"Recombinant regulators of G protein-signaling (RGS) proteins stimulate hydrolysis of GTP by α subunits of the Gi family but have not been reported to regulate other G protein α subunits. Expression of recombinant RGS proteins in cultured cells inhibits Gi-mediated hormonal signals probably by acting as GTPase-activating proteins for Gαisubunits. To ask whether an RGS protein can also regulate cellular responses mediated by G proteins in the Gq/11 family, we compared activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by a Gq/11-coupled receptor, the bombesin receptor (BR), and a Gi-coupled receptor, the D2 dopamine receptor, transiently co-expressed with or without recombinant RGS4 in COS-7 cells. Pertussis toxin, which uncouples Gi from receptors, blocked MAPK activation by the D2 dopamine receptor but not by the BR. Co-expression of RGS4, however, inhibited activation of MAPK by both receptors causing a rightward shift of the concentration-effect curve for both receptor agonists. RGS4 also inhibited BR-stimulated synthesis of inositol phosphates by an effector target of Gq/11, phospholipase C. Moreover, RGS4 inhibited inositol phosphate synthesis activated by addition of AlF4− to cells overexpressing recombinant αq, probably by binding to αq·GDP·AlF4−. These results demonstrate that RGS4 can regulate Gq/11-mediated cellular signals by competing for effector binding as well as by acting as a GTPase-activating protein. Recombinant regulators of G protein-signaling (RGS) proteins stimulate hydrolysis of GTP by α subunits of the Gi family but have not been reported to regulate other G protein α subunits.

These results demonstrate that RGS4 can regulate Gq/11-mediated cellular signals by competing for effector binding as well as by acting as a GTPase-activating protein. Heterotrimeric G proteins transduce extracellular signals detected by transmembrane receptors into appropriate cellular responses (1Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Google Scholar, 2Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Google Scholar). The intensity and duration of these responses depend on the relative rates of biochemical reactions that turn G proteins on and off. The G protein switch turns on when receptors promote replacement of GTP for GDP bound by α subunits of αβγ trimers, leading to dissociation of active Gα·GTP from the βγ dimer and consequent regulation of downstream effectors. A GTPase activity intrinsic to α subunits turns off signals by converting α·GTP to inactive Gα·GDP, which then binds to and inactivates βγ. For pure Gα subunits in vitro the turnoff reaction is slow, ≤4 min−1 (2Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Google Scholar). In contrast, many G protein-mediated physiological responses must turn off much more rapidly, in fractions of a second. Two classes of GTPase-activating protein (GAP) 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; PLC, phospholipase C; G protein, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; BR, bombesin receptor; D2R, D2 dopamine receptor; PTX, pertussis toxin; MBP, myelin basic protein; IP, inositol phosphates; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; HA, hemagglutinin. have been reported to accelerate deactivation of trimeric G proteins. One class includes G protein effectors, such as phospholipase C (PLC) and the cGMP phosphodiesterase γ subunit, which stimulate GTP hydrolysis by αq and αt, respectively (3Berstein G. Blank J.L.

Recent investigations have discovered and characterized a second class of Gα-GAPs, the RGS (regulators of G protein signaling) proteins. Pure recombinant RGS proteins display GAP activities for certain G protein α subunits (5Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Google Scholar, 6Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G.

Indeed, a mammalian RGS can partially complement yeast mutations that inactivate Sst2p, the RGS of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Google Scholar). Mammalian RGS proteins thus far examined appear to act selectively as GAPs for Gα proteins in the αi family (5Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Google Scholar, 6Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Google Scholar, 7Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J.

Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12885-12889Google Scholar). Transient expression of RGS4 in HEK293 cells inhibits Gi-mediated activation of MAP kinase (MAPK) in response to stimulation of the interleukin-8 receptor (12Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H.

In the yeast two-hybrid system, in vitro binding, and co-immunoprecipitation assays, RGS4 interacts with αifamily proteins but not with αs or α12(5Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G.

Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Google Scholar). Recent experiments indicate that RGS4 can interact with αq/11 proteins albeit less efficiently than with αi. A high concentration of αq·GDP bound to AlF4− can inhibit the GAP activity of RGS4 for αo·GTP, presumably because αq·GDP·AlF4− competes against αo·GTP for binding the RGS protein (6Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Google Scholar). Moreover, RGS4 can stimulate the GTPase activity of αq in reconstituted vesicles (15Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Google Scholar). It is not known, however, whether RGS proteins can serve in intact cells as αq-GAPs and inhibitors of Gq-mediated cellular signals. Here we use expression of recombinant RGS4 in COS-7 cells to show that RGS4 can inhibit cellular signals mediated by Gq/11. FLAG-tagged human RGS4 cDNA was a generous gift from John H. Kehrl at the Laboratory of Immunoregulation, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. cDNA constructs for the bombesin receptor (BR), D2 dopamine receptor (D2R), and the β2-adrenoreceptor were as described (16Lustig K.D. Conklin B.R. Herzmark P. Taussig R. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13900-13905Google Scholar). Chinese hamster cDNA encoding an HA-tagged p44 MAPK was a gift from J. Pouysségur, Nice, France. pcDNAI and pCR3 were from Invitrogen, San Diego. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's H21 medium with 10% calf serum. DNA was transfected with adenovirus and DEAE-dextran as described (17Forsayeth J.R. Garcia P.D. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 354-358Google Scholar). Transfection efficiencies were determined by co-transfection of the plasmid pON249 encoding β-galactosidase and assayed as described (17Forsayeth J.R. Garcia P.D.

Expression of FLAG-tagged RGS4 and HA-tagged MAPK in total cell lysates was detected by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) and 12CA5, respectively. HA-MAPK activity was assayed by a procedure modified from that described by Faure et al. (18Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected in 6-well plates at 0.8 × 106 cells/well and placed in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin after incubating for 24 h in medium containing 10% calf serum. MAPK activity was measured 48 h after transfection. After PTX pretreatment (100 ng/ml for 4 h), where indicated, cells were stimulated for 10 min with appropriate agonists. HA-MAPK immunoprecipitated from cell lysates was incubated with bovine myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma) as a substrate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN).32P-Phosphorylated MBP was quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) after resolution on a 14% polyacrylamide gel. Total cellular inositol phosphates (IP) was measured according to Conklin et al.(19Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection cells were replated in a 24-well plate and labeled for 24 h withmyo-[3H]inositol (4 μCi/ml, Amersham Corp.). After washing with medium containing 5 mm LiCl for 10 min, cells were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with the appropriate agonist in the same medium containing LiCl. IP and total inositol fractions were resolved on a Dowex AG 1-X8 formate column (Bio-Rad) (12Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Google Scholar), and cellular IP content was expressed as the ratio of IP radioactivity to the sum of IP plus inositol radioactivity. Intracellular [3H]cAMP accumulation was estimated by determining the ratio of cAMP to the cellular pool of ATP plus ADP as described (16Lustig K.D. Conklin B.R. Herzmark P. Taussig R. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13900-13905Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection each 60-mm dish of 1 × 106 cells was split into 9 wells in a 24-well plate and incubated in medium containing [3H]adenine (2 μCi/ml, Amersham). 18–24 h later, cells were washed once with 1 ml of assay medium and incubated in 1 ml of assay medium containing 1 mm1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine and agonist (isoproterenol) for 30 min as indicated. To assess effects of an RGS protein on cellular responses mediated by G proteins in the Gq/11 family, we compared MAPK activation by a Gq/11-coupled receptor, BR, and a Gi-coupled receptor, D2R, that co-expressed with or without recombinant RGS4 in COS-7 cells (Figs.1 and 2). Expression of RGS4 blocked MAPK activation by the Gq/11-coupled receptor agonist, bombesin (1 nm); PTX, which specifically blocks signaling by receptors that activate Gi proteins, did not inhibit the effect of bombesin (Fig. 1 A). These results suggest that RGS4 inhibited bombesin signaling to MAPK by inhibiting the action of a G protein other than Gi, probably Gq/11. This inference was supported by additional experiments described below. Confirming a previous report (12Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Google Scholar) that recombinant RGS4 can inhibit Gi-mediated signals in an intact cultured cell, RGS4 markedly inhibited Gi-dependent MAPK activation by the D2R agonist, quinpirole (10 nm; Fig.1 B); PTX also blocked the D2R effect on MAPK (Fig. 1 B). RGS4 did not alter the expression of HA-MAPK in these experiments (data not shown).Figure 2RGS4 increases the agonist concentration required for activating MAPK. Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-MAPK (1 μg), RGS4 (2 μg) or vector plasmid pCR3 (2 μg), and 1 μg of BR (A) or D2R (B). Cells were exposed for 10 min to the indicated concentration of bombesin (A) and quinpirole (B), and HA-MAPK activities were determined. HA-MAPK activities are expressed in arbitrary units of MBP phosphofluorescence (see “Experimental Procedures”). Data represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations; an additional experiment gave similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further assess the effectiveness of RGS4 in blocking cellular responses mediated by Gq/11 and Gi, we measured MAPK activation by a range of concentrations of both agonists (Fig. 2). In both cases, a higher concentration of each agonist was required to produce equivalent MAPK activation in cells overexpressing RGS4, that is expression of RGS4 shifted the agonist concentration curve to the right. In RGS4-expressing cells, the apparent EC50 of bombesin was increased ∼5-fold (Fig. 2 A). The quinpirole concentration-effect curve was shifted to the right ∼10-fold (Fig.2 B) indicating a relatively greater effectiveness of RGS4 for inhibiting the Gi-mediated effect in comparison with that mediated by Gq/11. The apparent difference in potency could reflect different mechanisms by which RGS4 inhibits the two effects, but it is also consistent with a simpler interpretation that the RGS protein catalyzes GTP hydrolysis less efficiently with αq/11 than with αi proteins. The RGS-induced rightward shift of signaling concentration-effect curves (Fig. 2) is predictable from the GAP mechanism of RGS action. When a GAP increases the rate of GTP hydrolysis, equivalent steady-state concentrations of Gα·GTP can only be achieved by an increased rate of receptor-catalyzed GTP-for-GDP exchange and thus by higher concentrations of agonist-occupied receptor. The extent of an RGS-induced rightward shift would be limited by thek d of the agonist ligand for the relevant receptor. Although a GAP-induced shift in concentration-response curves has not been previously documented, it would be an attractive way to fine tune responsiveness of cells to extracellular stimuli. In phospholipid vesicles reconstituted with a M1-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and Gq, the EC50 of carbachol for stimulating GTP hydrolysis was increased by addition of purified PLCβ1, an αq-GAP; in this case, addition of the GAP also markedly increased the maximal rate of GTP hydrolysis (3Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Google Scholar, 20Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Google Scholar). To determine whether similar concentrations of cellular RGS4 are required to inhibit Gi- and Gq-dependent hormonal signals, we transfected cells with graded amounts of RGS4 plasmid (Fig. 3), which produced graded cellular amounts of RGS4 protein (Fig.3 C). RGS4 inhibited Gi- and Gq-mediated elevation of MAPK activity with similar dose-effect curves over a 16-fold range of transfected DNA (Fig. 3,A and B). Although the endogenous amounts of cellular RGS proteins are unknown, this result argues that similar amounts of RGS4 protein are required to produce both inhibitory effects. It is unlikely that all RGS proteins exhibit quantitatively similar abilities to inhibit Gi- and Gq-dependent hormonal signals. Indeed, another member of the RGS protein family, GAIP, inhibited Gi-mediated activation of MAPK much more effectively than that mediated by Gq/11. 2P. P. Chi, unpublished result. If RGS4 inhibits BR stimulation of MAPK activity by inactivating Gq/11, the RGS protein should also reduce BR-stimulated synthesis of IP by PLC, the principal effector of Gq/11. Indeed, expression of RGS4 reduced bombesin-induced IP accumulation by about 50% (Fig. 4 A). The inhibitory effect of RGS4 was probably exerted on Gαq/11rather than on Gαi because PTX failed to inhibit BR-induced IP accumulation (not shown). The BR is likely to stimulate IP accumulation via the α subunit of Gq/11 rather than via its βγ subunit because PLCβ1 and PLCβ3, the G protein-responsive PLC isozymes of COS cells, are sensitive to αq/11 stimulation but relatively insensitive to stimulation by Gβγ; COS cells lack PLCβ2, the PLC isozyme that is most sensitive to βγ (21Jiang H. Kuang Y. Wu Y. Smrcka A. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13430-13434Google Scholar). RGS4 reduced maximal stimulation of IP accumulation by BR stimulation but did not alter the EC50 for bombesin (Fig.4 A). In contrast, RGS4 expression did not affect maximal activation of MAPK by bombesin but did cause a rightward shift of the bombesin concentration-effect curve (Fig. 2 A). How could the relations between agonist concentration and response be different, if as seems likely, both BR responses are mediated by Gq/11and stimulation of PLC? Although we do not know the reason for this discrepancy, the two assays were performed under different conditions and reflect activation of Gq/11 and PLC in different ways. BR-mediated elevation of MAPK activity measured 10 min after addition of agonist probably results from some (undefined) combination of signals triggered by diacylglycerol activating protein kinase C isozymes and by inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) elevating cytoplasmic Ca2+. The IP measurements, in contrast, assessed accumulation at 45 min of total radioactive inositol phosphates in cells labeled with radioactive inositol and exposed to LiCl, which inhibits IP degradation. InsP3 constitutes only a fraction of the total IP pool, and LiCl may not alter concentrations of InsP3 and total inositol phosphates in the same way. Consequently, the extent and time course of bombesin-induced changes in InsP3 under conditions used in the MAPK experiments need not parallel bombesin-induced changes in total IP accumulation. As expected from the reported (5Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Google Scholar, 6Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Google Scholar) inability of RGS4 to stimulate GTP hydrolysis by the α subunit of Gs, the RGS protein had no effect on cAMP production stimulated by the β2-adrenoreceptor agonist, isoproterenol (Fig.4 B) or on the cAMP-mediated activation of MAPK by isoproterenol (not shown). To support the idea that RGS4 inhibits PLC stimulation by an effect on αq/11, we took advantage of a recently discovered property of RGS proteins in vitro, their ability to bind Gα proteins whose nucleotide binding pockets contain GDP complexed with AlF4− (6Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Google Scholar, 8Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Google Scholar, 9Chen C.-K. Wieland T. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12885-12889Google Scholar). This property is thought to reflect enhanced affinity of RGS proteins for a Gα conformation that mimics the transition state of GTP hydrolysis; it was useful for our purposes because the conformation of Gα·GDP·AlF4− also allows it to regulate activity of the appropriate effector. Although RGS4 reportedly (6Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Google Scholar) binds Gαq·GDP·AlF4− less tightly than Gαi·GDP·AlF4−, we imagined that an RGS4-αq interaction would inhibit stimulation of IP accumulation in cells transfected with recombinant Gαq and exposed to AlF4−. This turned out to be the case (Fig. 5). AlF4− elevated cellular IP accumulation in cells expressing recombinant Gαq but had no effect in untransfected cells; by itself, recombinant Gαq produced a smaller but reproducible elevation of cellular IP content. These results suggest that increased abundance of Gαq caused a modest elevation in the cellular concentration of its GTP-bound form, and that addition of AlF4− activated PLC still further by binding to the GDP-bound form of transfected Gαq, rendering it capable of activating the effector enzyme. Co-expression of RGS4 with Gαq substantially inhibited IP accumulation in response to AlF4− (Fig. 5). RGS4 presumably inhibited effector stimulation in this case not by accelerating GTP hydrolysis but by binding to and sequestering Gαq·GDP·AlF4−. RGS4 also decreased the elevation of MAPK activity seen in untreated cells transfected with Gαq (not shown), an effect that probably reflects acceleration of GTP hydrolysis by Gαq. In summary, we present two new sets of observations. While RGS proteins are known to inhibit signals mediated by Gi, we show for the first time that an RGS protein can interact with Gαq/11 and inhibit signals transduced by Gαq/11 in intact cells. RGS4 probably inhibits bombesin responses by acting as a GAP, that is, by stimulating the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gαq/11. Our experiments also raise the possibility that RGS4 inhibits bombesin responses by sequestering the GTP-bound active conformation of Gαq/11 (that is, by the mechanism that probably inhibits the AlF4− response), in addition to stimulating GTP hydrolysis. Second, we found that RGS4 induces rightward shifts in concentration-effect curves for agonists acting on receptors coupled to either Gi or Gq/11. It is likely that other RGS proteins modulate hormonal signals mediated by Gi and Gq/11 in much the same way. For each response, the extent of the rightward shift will depend on the local concentration of RGS protein and its relative affinity for the G protein involved. Thus different complements of RGS proteins could allow two cells to mount quantitatively different responses to the same concentration of a physiological agonist even when both cells use the same receptors and G proteins. If the relevant receptor couples to two distinct G proteins (for instance, to Gq and Gs or to Gi and Gq), differing cellular complements of RGS proteins with distinct Gα selectivities could even produce qualitatively different responses of two cells to the same agonist.

Determination of the membrane topology of the presenilins, in other words defining which parts of the polypeptide chain traverse the lipid bilayer, is of enormous importance in understanding the function of these proteins and their role in AD. There are several reasons for this. First, knowing which domains of the polypeptide lie in the cytoplasm and which in the lumen of the ER or Golgi will dictate hypotheses about the function of these domains. Second, experimental attempts to identify cytoplasmic proteins that interact with the presenilins using screening procedures such as the yeast two-hybrid system or interaction cloning require a knowledge of which segments of the polypeptide chain lie in the cytoplasm. Third, the membrane topology of the presenilins can be correlated with the positions of pathogenic mutations, providing clues to how these mutations alter the function of the proteins. Finally, knowledge of the membrane topology of the presenilins will allow a more detailed comparison with possible homologues than is possible simply on the basis of hydrophobicity plots. We report here our analysis of the membrane topology of PS1 using bothin vitro and in vivo expression systems. Our results suggest that the protein spans the membrane six times, with both N and C termini located in the cytoplasm.

Slunt H.H. Ratovitsky T. Podlisny M. Selkoe D.J. Seeger M. Gandy S.E. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1023-1030Google Scholar), but they differ from those of a second study proposing an eight-transmembrane topology for the presenilin homologue SEL-12 (22Li X. Greenwald I. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1015-1021Google Scholar). The PS1 segments of HR-PRL chimeras were generated by PCR, using as a template a PS1 cDNA derived from the RNA splice variant lacking exon 4 (which encodes the sequence VSRQ) (provided by Dr. Alison Goate (Ref. 8Alzheimer's Disease Collaborative Group, Nat. Genet., 11, 1995, 219, 222.Google Scholar)). The 5′ primer was GATCAGGAATTCATGACAGAGTTACCTGCACCG. The 3′ primer consisted of the sequence GACTAGGGTAACCAA followed by the complement of the sequence encoding the following amino acids: 122–128 for HR1-PRL, 151–157 for HR2-PRL, 181–187 for HR3-PRL, 209–215 for HR4-PRL, 233–239 for HR5-PRL, 271–277 for HR6-PRL, 370–376 for HR7-PRL, 397–403 for HR8-PRL, 423–429 for HR9-PRL, and 457–463 for HR10-PRL. The reporter segment of the chimeras was generated by amplification of the 148 C-terminal amino acids of bovine prolactin, using as a template pBP292 (American Type Culture Collection). The 5′ primer was GATCAGGAATTCGATCTTGGTTACCATGGCCCTCAACAGCTGCCAT. The 3′ primer, which encoded three consensus sites for N-glycosylation and an HA tag, had the sequence: CTGCTATCTAGACTATGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTACATAGTTCCGTTCATGGATCCGTTAGTGCAGTTGTTGTTGTAGATGAT. The PS1 fragments were digested with EcoRI andBstEII, and the reporter fragment with BstEII andXbaI. The fragments were ligated intoEcoRI-XbaI-digested pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). All constructs were sequenced in their entirety. Plasmids were linearized with XbaI and capped mRNAs synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase using a kit from Ambion. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate and canine pancreatic microsomes were obtained from Promega and used to translate mRNAs in the presence of [35S]methionine as described by the manufacturer. Proteinase K treatment of translation reactions was performed at final concentration of 50 μg/ml for 1 h on ice in the presence or absence of 0.5% Triton X-100, followed by inactivation of the protease with 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 6 μl of translation reaction was added to 40 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (pepstatin and leupeptin, 1 μg/ml; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm; EDTA, 2 mm). After 5 min at 25 °C, 160 μl of dilution buffer (50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors was added, and the samples were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads. The supernatants were then incubated with one of the following rabbit antibodies: anti-HA (Babco), anti-bovine prolactin (Dr. A. F. Parlow), or anti-PS1 (prepared by Dr. Jeanne Nerbonne against a synthetic peptide encompassing residues 26–42). Immunocomplexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Samples were heated at 60 °C for 5 min prior to SDS-PAGE, since boiling results in aggregation of PS1 proteins (23Yamamoto A. Sahara N. Usami M. Okochi M. Kondo T. Kametani F. Tanaka K. Yahagi Y. Shirasawa T. Itoyama Y. Mori H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 536-541Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mmpyruvate, and penicillin/streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% C02, 95% air. Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions and 48 h later were labeled for 3 h with [35S]methionine. Labeled cultures were extracted with lysis buffer and PS1-PRL proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody as described above. For protease digestion experiments, labeled cells were collected in phosphate-buffered saline and gently homogenized by passage eight times through 0.25-mm diameter plastic tubing attached at each end to a 27-gauge needle on a syringe. After centrifugation at 700 × g for 3 min, the postnuclear supernatant was treated with proteinase K in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 and proteins immunoprecipitated as described above. After addition of lysis and dilution buffers as described above, reticulocyte lysate was treated with 0.025 unit/ml of N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) for 6 h at 37 °C. Proteins were then precipitated with 4 volumes of methanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Diluted lysates of COS cells were treated with 0.01 unit/ml of the enzyme for 16 h at 37 °C prior to immunoprecipitation. Hydrophobicity plots identify 10 segments of at least 15 amino acids in the sequence of PS1 that could potentially span the membrane (Fig. 1 A). We have constructed chimeras in which a prolactin reporter is fused after each of these hydrophobic regions (Fig. 1 B). The reporter is a C-terminal fragment of bovine prolactin (residues 82–229) onto which we have appended three consensus sites for N-glycosylation, as well as an HA tag so that the proteins can be recognized by anti-HA as well as anti-prolactin antibodies. A number of studies have utilized this portion of prolactin as a reporter, since it lacks any signals that might influence the membrane orientation of the adjacent polypeptide (24Rothman R.E. Andrews D.W. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10470-10480Google Scholar, 25Bennett J.A. Dingeldine R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 373-384Google Scholar, 26Chavez R.A. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 385-393Google Scholar). When the fusion proteins are synthesized on membrane-attached ribosomes, the reporter will be glycosylated and protected from proteases applied from the cytoplasmic surface only if it resides in the lumen of the ER, which is topologically equivalent to the extracellular space. The two techniques we have combined here, tagging a protein with artificial glycosylation sites and fusing it to a reporter molecule that can be recognized by antibody binding or enzymatic activity, have been used individually to map the topology of a number of other membrane proteins (27Hollmann M. Maron C. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1331-1343Google Scholar, 28Hennessey E.S. Broome-Smith J.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 524-531Google Scholar). We recognize that although these techniques can provide evidence in support of a specific model of membrane topology, it is always possible that experimental modifications of the polypeptide chain may perturb its interaction with the lipid bilayer. We first translated synthetic mRNAs encoding the PS1-prolactin chimeras in a reticulocyte lysate system. In the absence of canine pancreatic microsomes, proteins ranging in size from 33 to 70 kDa were recovered after immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody, corresponding to the unglycosylated fusion proteins (Fig.2 A, lane 1). When translation was performed in the presence of microsomes, HR1-PRL, HR3-PRL, and HR5-PRL (but not the other constructs) yielded additional products of slightly higher molecular weight (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). These larger products represent glycosylated forms of the proteins, since they are eliminated when samples are treated with N-glycosidase F (Fig.2 B, lanes 3 and 4). As has been observed by others (25Bennett J.A. Dingeldine R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 373-384Google Scholar, 26Chavez R.A. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 385-393Google Scholar), glycosylation in the in vitro system is inefficient, resulting in the presence of some unglycosylated protein even when translation is performed with microsomes (Fig. 2 A, lane 2; Fig. 2 B, lane 3). We noted that PS1-PRL fusion proteins often migrated as closely spaced doublets on SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2); this phenomenon has been observed for full-length PS1 synthesized both in vitro and in transfected cells and is likely to result from an uncharacterized posttranslational modification (11Kovacs D.M. Fausett H.J. Page K.J. Kim T.W. Moir R.D. Merriam D.E. Hollister R.D. Hallmark O.G. Mancini R. Felsenstein K.M. Hyman B.T. Tanzi R.E. Wasco W. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 224-229Google Scholar, 12Cook D.G. Sung J.C. Golde T.E. Felsenstein K.M. Wojczyk B.S. Tanzi R.E. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.Y. Doms R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9223-9228Google Scholar, 29Selkoe D.J. Xia W. Zhang J. Podlisny M.B. Amarante P. Haass C. St. George Hyslop P.H. Teplow D.B. Koo E.H. Citron M. Soc. Neurosci. Abst. 1996; 22: 278Google Scholar). HR1-PRL, HR3-PRL, and HR5-PRL were also the only three chimeras that produced a protected fragment reactive with anti-HA antibody after treatment of the microsome-containing translation mixture with proteinase K (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). The protected fragment was glycosylated (not shown) and migrated approximately 7 kDa lower than the corresponding intact glycosylated protein (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). The fragment was eliminated when microsomes were permeabilized with Triton X-100 prior to protease digestion (Fig. 2 A, lane 4), demonstrating that it does not represent an intrinsically protease-resistant portion of the molecule. The protected fragment could be immunoprecipitated with anti-prolactin as well as anti-HA antibodies, but not with an antibody against the N terminus of PS1 (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 4), indicating that the N terminus is protease-accessible and is therefore cytoplasmic. Based on the 7-kDa reduction in molecular size, we infer that proteinase K removes approximately 70 amino acids from the N terminus of HR1-, HR3-, and HR5-PRL (up to a point near the beginning of HR1), but that the cytoplasmic loops between the transmembrane hydrophobic segments are resistant to cleavage, probably because they are short (<10 amino acids) and therefore closely apposed to the lipid bilayer (25Bennett J.A. Dingeldine R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 373-384Google Scholar). To confirm these in vitro translation results in intact cells, we expressed each of the PS1-PRL fusion proteins in COS cells. We again observed that only HR1-, HR3-, and HR5-PRL were glycosylated, as indicated by a reduction in the molecular weight of these proteins upon treatment with N-glycosidase F (Fig.4 A). In contrast to the situation in reticulocyte lysate, glycosylation of these chimeras in COS cells was essentially quantitative, making it unlikely that the proteins are heterogeneous with respect to localization of the reporter. Each of these three fusion proteins also produces a protected fragment that is ∼7 kDa smaller than the intact protein following proteinase K digestion of a postnuclear supernatant derived from the transfected cells (Fig. 4 B); the other seven fusion proteins do not yield any protected fragments (data not shown). Results similar to those shown in Fig. 4 have also been obtained in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (not shown). Taken together, the results of glycosylation site utilization and protease protection both in vitro and in cells suggest the model of PS1 topology shown in Fig. 5. HR1, HR3, and HR5 span the membrane from the cytoplasmic to the lumenal side and HR2, HR4, and HR6 from the lumenal to the cytoplasmic side. Both the N and C termini are cytoplasmic. HR7–HR10 do not constitute transmembrane domains, although our analysis does not address the issue of whether these segments associate closely with the lipid bilayer in the manner of “reentrant loops” described for some channel proteins (25Bennett J.A. Dingeldine R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 373-384Google Scholar, 27Hollmann M. Maron C. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1331-1343Google Scholar,30MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 889-892Google Scholar). This model places the two consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation (asparagine residues 275 and 401) in the cytoplasm, consistent with the fact that full-length PS1 expressed in cells or byin vitro translation is not glycosylated (12Cook D.G. Sung J.C. Golde T.E. Felsenstein K.M. Wojczyk B.S. Tanzi R.E. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.Y. Doms R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9223-9228Google Scholar, 23Yamamoto A. Sahara N. Usami M.

Amarante P. Haass C. St. George Hyslop P.H. Teplow D.B. Koo E.H. Citron M. Soc. Neurosci. Abst. 1996; 22: 278Google Scholar). Given the high degree of homology between PS1 and PS2, we would predict that PS2 has the same membrane topology shown in Fig. 5. Although our data support a six-transmembrane domain structure for PS1, it is of course possible that the membrane topology of the native protein is different from the one we have inferred here based on the properties of PS1-prolactin fusions. However, the fusion of a reporter segment or the introduction of ectopic glycosylation sites has not been found to disturb the topology of a number of other membrane proteins (27Hollmann M. Maron C. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1331-1343Google Scholar,28Hennessey E.S. Broome-Smith J.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 524-531Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with those of Doan et al. (21Doan A. Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Slunt H.H. Ratovitsky T. Podlisny M. Selkoe D.J. Seeger M. Gandy S.E. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1023-1030Google Scholar) who concluded that PS1 has either six or eight transmembrane domains (their data did not distinguish between the two possibilities), with the N terminus, C terminus, and part of the “loop” region between residues 320 and 390 in the cytoplasm. However, our results differ from those of Li and Greenwald (22Li X. Greenwald I. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1015-1021Google Scholar) who proposed a model for the C. elegans PS1 homologue SEL-12 having eight transmembrane segments, including HR1–HR6, HR-8, and HR-9. We think it unlikely on theoretical grounds that HR8 of PS1 spans the membrane, since it is short (16 amino acids) and is only marginally hydrophobic (see Fig. 1 A). The identification of HR8 and HR9 as transmembrane segments in SEL-12 was inferred indirectly from the enzymatic activity of a pair of β-galactosidase fusions in which HR8 was deleted, and it is possible that this deletion modified the membrane topology of the protein or altered the activity of the galactosidase reporter. It is also conceivable that the membrane topologies of PS1 and SEL-12 are different. Our model for the topology of PS1 has important implications for the function of the protein and its role in AD. We find that most of the polypeptide chain of PS1 is cytoplasmic, including the N-terminal region and a long C-terminal tail encompassing HR7–HR10. These segments may therefore be important in interactions with cytoplasmic proteins. Much of the cytoplasmic region from HR6 to the C terminus, exclusive of the segment between HR7 and HR8, is highly conserved in the presenilins and SEL-12, suggesting essential functions for this domain. A number of pathogenic mutations are found between the end of HR6 and the end of HR7 (reviewed in Ref. 6Haass C. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1996; 9: 254-259Google Scholar), and one might speculate that these alter associations of PS1 with molecules in the cytoplasm. Since little of the polypeptide chain protrudes into the ER lumen, a direct interaction between PS1 and lumenal proteins seems unlikely, although associations with other ER membrane proteins are possible. If PS1 binds to APP, a possibility suggested by enhanced production of the Aβ 42 fragment in cells expressing mutant PS1 (16Citron M. Westaway D. Xia W. Carlson G. Diehl T. Levesque G.

Nature. 1996; 383: 710-713Google Scholar), this interaction would most likely occur transiently during transit of APP through the ER and Golgi and would probably involve either the transmembrane region or short cytoplasmic tail of APP. The topology model proposed here makes it unlikely that PS1 functions as a conventional G-protein-coupled receptor, but is consistent with a role for PS1 in processes such as vesicle docking and budding, membrane-cytoskeletal interactions, or ion and solute transport. The recently described endoproteolytic cleavage of PS1 (13Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Google Scholar), which is predicted to occur following HR6, would be expected to generate a C-terminal fragment that lacks any transmembrane segments. Whether this fragment is soluble would depend on how tightly HR7–HR10 are associated with the lipid bilayer, but if it were diffusible it could serve to transmit a signal to other regions of the cell. Knowing the membrane topology of PS1 will now facilitate attempts to isolate interacting molecules and will provide a starting point for further investigations of the biological activity of normal and mutant forms of the protein.

The transcription of the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of G6Pase is stimulated by glucocorticoids, whereas insulin strongly inhibits both basal G6Pase gene transcription and the stimulatory effect of glucocorticoids. To identify the insulin response sequence (IRS) in the G6Pase promoter through which insulin mediates its action, we have analyzed the effect of insulin on the basal expression of mouse G6Pase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion genes transiently expressed in hepatoma cells. Deletion of the G6Pase promoter sequence between −271 and −199 partially reduces the inhibitory effect of insulin, whereas deletion of additional sequence between −198 and −159 completely abolishes the insulin response. The presence of this multicomponent IRS may explain why insulin potently inhibits basal G6Pase-CAT expression. The G6Pase promoter region between −198 and −159 contains an IRS, since it can confer an inhibitory effect of insulin on the expression of a heterologous fusion gene. This region contains three copies of the T(G/A)TTTTG sequence, which is the core motif of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene IRS. This suggests that a coordinate increase in both G6Pase and PEPCK gene transcription is likely to contribute to the increased hepatic glucose production characteristic of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

U91573 While insulin has long been known to modulate intracellular metabolism by altering the activity or intracellular location of various enzymes, it is only more recently that the regulation of gene transcription by insulin has been recognized as a major action of this hormone (1O'Brien R.M.

Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Google Scholar). Instead, most of the sequences identified to date appear unique, a situation that resembles that for phorbol esters that regulate gene transcription through at least eight distinct consensus sequences (4Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 48: 157-188Google Scholar).Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is characterized by defects in insulin secretion, peripheral glucose utilization, and hepatic glucose production (HGP) (5DeFronzo R.A. Bonadonna R.C. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 318-368Google Scholar). The ability of insulin to stimulate peripheral glucose utilization and repress HGP in patients with NIDDM is reduced, a phenomenon known as insulin resistance (5DeFronzo R.A. Bonadonna R.C. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 318-368Google Scholar). Various investigators have speculated that an alteration in the insulin-regulated expression of specific genes, a consequence of insulin resistance, may contribute to the pathophysiology of this disease (1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Google Scholar, 5DeFronzo R.A. Bonadonna R.C. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 318-368Google Scholar, 6Granner D.K. O'Brien R.M.

FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2978-2988Google Scholar) is one such candidate, since it catalyzes the final step in the gluconeogenic pathway, the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose (8Pilkis S.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25019-25025Google Scholar). Experiments in FAO rat hepatoma cells (14Lange A.J. Argaud D. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pan W. Maitra S.R. Pilkis S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1563-1571Google Scholar) have shown that insulin treatment reduces both basal and glucocorticoid-induced G6Pase mRNA levels. Since the increased fasting HGP characteristic of NIDDM may be explained, in part, by an increase in G6Pase gene expression resulting from a loss of insulin repression, it is of interest to determine the mechanism whereby insulin normally inhibits G6Pase gene expression. This manuscript describes the identification of a potent IRS in the G6Pase promoter. While insulin has long been known to modulate intracellular metabolism by altering the activity or intracellular location of various enzymes, it is only more recently that the regulation of gene transcription by insulin has been recognized as a major action of this hormone (1O'Brien R.M.

Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Google Scholar). cis-Acting elements that mediate the action of insulin on gene transcription, referred to as an insulin response sequences or elements (IRSs/IREs), 1The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin response sequence; G6Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; IGFBP-1, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1; TAT, tyrosine aminotransferase; ApoCIII, apolipoprotein CIII; NIDDM, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; HGP, hepatic glucose production; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; bp, base pair(s); TK, thymidine kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin response sequence; G6Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; IGFBP-1, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1; TAT, tyrosine aminotransferase; ApoCIII, apolipoprotein CIII; NIDDM, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; HGP, hepatic glucose production; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; bp, base pair(s); TK, thymidine kinase. have been identified in a number of genes but, unlike cAMP (2Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Google Scholar, 3Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27783-27786Google Scholar), which regulates gene transcription predominantly through onecis-acting element, it is already apparent that a single consensus IRS does not exist (1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Google Scholar). Instead, most of the sequences identified to date appear unique, a situation that resembles that for phorbol esters that regulate gene transcription through at least eight distinct consensus sequences (4Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 48: 157-188Google Scholar). Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is characterized by defects in insulin secretion, peripheral glucose utilization, and hepatic glucose production (HGP) (5DeFronzo R.A. Bonadonna R.C. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 318-368Google Scholar). The ability of insulin to stimulate peripheral glucose utilization and repress HGP in patients with NIDDM is reduced, a phenomenon known as insulin resistance (5DeFronzo R.A. Bonadonna R.C. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 318-368Google Scholar). Various investigators have speculated that an alteration in the insulin-regulated expression of specific genes, a consequence of insulin resistance, may contribute to the pathophysiology of this disease (1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Google Scholar, 5DeFronzo R.A. Bonadonna R.C. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 318-368Google Scholar, 6Granner D.K. O'Brien R.M. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 369-395Google Scholar). The gene encoding the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) catalytic subunit (7Burchell A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2978-2988Google Scholar) is one such candidate, since it catalyzes the final step in the gluconeogenic pathway, the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose (8Pilkis S.J. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 885-909Google Scholar). The activity (9Burchell A. Cain D.I. Diabetologia. 1985; 28: 852-856Google Scholar, 10Massillon D. Barzilai N. Chen W. Hu M.

Invest. 1995; 95: 832-841Google Scholar) of the G6Pase catalytic subunit is increased in diabetic animals, and this contributes to increased fasting HGP (13Barzilai N. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25019-25025Google Scholar). Experiments in FAO rat hepatoma cells (14Lange A.J. Argaud D. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pan W. Maitra S.R. Pilkis S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 302-309Google Scholar) and primary hepatocytes (15Argaud D. Zhang Q. Pan W. Maitra S. Pilkis S.J. Lange A.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1563-1571Google Scholar) have shown that insulin treatment reduces both basal and glucocorticoid-induced G6Pase mRNA levels. Since the increased fasting HGP characteristic of NIDDM may be explained, in part, by an increase in G6Pase gene expression resulting from a loss of insulin repression, it is of interest to determine the mechanism whereby insulin normally inhibits G6Pase gene expression. This manuscript describes the identification of a potent IRS in the G6Pase promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2140236160,"Abstract cDNA libraries from rat chromaffin cells and PC12 cells were screened for homologs to the mouse mSlo gene that encodes a large conductance, calcium (Ca2+)- and voltage-activated potassium channel (BK channel). One Slovariant contained sequence encoding a cysteine-rich, 59-amino acid insert for a previously described site of alternative splicing. This insert is reminiscent of zinc-finger domains. The exon was found in RNA from pancreas, anterior pituitary, cerebellum, and hippocampus. Expression in Xenopus oocytes of a Sloconstruct containing this exon conferred a −30 to −20 mV shift of the conductance-voltage curve. A previously uncharacterized alternative splice junction near the C-terminal end of Slo was also identified. In contrast to BK channels in rat chromaffin cells, none of the Slo variants exhibited inactivation when expressed inXenopus oocytes. PCR screening of chromaffin cell RNA failed to reveal a homolog of an accessory β subunit known to influence Slo channel function. Furthermore, a β-subunit-dependent Slo channel activator, dehydrosoyasaponin I, was without effect on chromaffin cell BK current. The results argue that an accessory subunit may not be a required component of the native chromaffin cell BK channel."
https://openalex.org/W1964241768,"Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-2 is a member of the C-C chemokine subfamily, which shares more than 60% sequence homology with MCP-1 and MCP-3 and about 30% homology with macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, regulated on activation of normal T cell expressed (RANTES), and MIP-1β. Despite this considerable sequence homology to other C-C chemokines, MCP-2 appears to have unique functional properties in comparison with other C-C chemokines such as MCP-1 and MCP-3. Although evidence obtained from studies on leukocytes suggested that MCP-2 may share the receptors with these C-C chemokines, the actual functional receptors for MCP-2 have not yet been identified. In this study, by using radioiodinated MCP-2, we identified high affinity binding sites for MCP-2 on human peripheral blood monocytes. The MCP-2 binding was competed for by MCP-1 and MCP-3, but less well by MIP-1α or RANTES. In experiments using cells transfected with C-C chemokine receptors, 125I-MCP-2 bound to human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with CCR1 or CCR2B, known to also bind MIP-1α/RANTES and MCP-1, respectively, but both shared by MCP-3. The binding of 125I-MCP-2 to these receptor-transfected cells was displaced completely by chemokines that bind to these receptors. Both CCR1- and CCR2B-transfected 293 cells showed significant migration in response to MCP-2, in addition to responding to other specific chemokines. These results clearly demonstrate that MCP-2, unlike MCP-1, uses both CCR1 as well as CCR2B as its functional receptors, and this accounts for the unique activities of MCP-2.

Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) 1The abbreviations used are: MCP, monocyte chemotactic protein; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; CCR, C-C chemokine receptor; IL, interleukin. 1The abbreviations used are: MCP, monocyte chemotactic protein; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; CCR, C-C chemokine receptor; IL, interleukin.-2 is a C-C chemokine co-purified with MCP-1 and MCP-3 from human osteosarcoma cells (1Van Damme J.

It shares over 60% amino acid identity with MCP-1 and MCP-3 and has about 30% identity with other C-C chemokines MIP-1α, RANTES, and MIP-1β (1, 2 and reviewed in Ref. 3Proost P. Van Damme J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 67-74Google Scholar). MCP-2 is chemotactic for and activates a wide variety of inflammatory cells, and its spectrum of action on leukocytes is similar to that of MCP-3, including monocytes, T lymphocytes, NK cells, basophils, mast cells, and eosinophils (1Van Damme J.

Baggiolini M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 751-756Google Scholar). Based on cross-desensitization of calcium mobilization in leukocyte subsets by different chemokines, and the competition by MCP-2 for binding sites of MCP-1 and MIP-1α on monocytes, MCP-2 has been proposed to interact with multiple C-C chemokine receptors, including those used by MCP-1 and MCP-3 (6Sozzani S.

J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 64-68Google Scholar). However, since leukocytes express a multiplicity of chemokine receptors with promiscuous binding and functional properties (reviewed in Ref.11Murphy P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 47-64Google Scholar), it is difficult to identify the receptors used by a given ligand on these cells. A number of C-C and C-X-C chemokine receptors have been cloned and functionally expressed on non-leukocytic cells. It has been shown that CCR1 is a receptor for MCP-3 and MIP-1α/RANTES (12Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Google Scholar, 13Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Google Scholar, 14Gao J.-L. Kuhns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermot D. Li X.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29671-29675Google Scholar), while CCR2B is shared mainly by MCP-1 and MCP-3 (15Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Google Scholar, 16Franci C. Wong L.M. Van Damme J. Proost P. Charo I.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6511-6517Google Scholar, 26Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Van Damme J. Tiffani H.L. Gao J.-L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29671-29675Google Scholar). Although CCR2B has been reported not to be functional for MCP-2 (16Franci C. Wong L.M. Van Damme J. Proost P. Charo I.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6511-6517Google Scholar,26Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Van Damme J. Tiffani H.L. Gao J.-L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29671-29675Google Scholar), the conclusion was derived from the failure of synthetic MCP-2 to induce calcium mobilization in CCR2B transfected HEK 293 cells and the inability of MCP-2 to desensitize MCP-1 induced calcium flux (16Franci C. Wong L.M. Van Damme J. Proost P. Charo I.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6511-6517Google Scholar, 26Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Van Damme J. Tiffani H.L. Gao J.-L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29671-29675Google Scholar). Since MCP-2 was a poor inducer of calcium mobilization in monocytes (6Sozzani S. Zhou D. Locati M. Rieppi M. Proost P. Magazin M. Vita N. Van Damme J. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3615-3622Google Scholar), and its chemotactic activity for monocytes was not Pertussis toxin-sensitive, MCP-2 was proposed to use signaling pathways distinct from other C-C chemokines (6Sozzani S. Zhou D. Locati M. Rieppi M. Proost P. Magazin M. Vita N. Van Damme J. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3615-3622Google Scholar). Despite this, MCP-2 was effective in attenuating the MCP-1-induced monocyte migration, through homologous deactivation, suggesting the utilization of the same MCP-1 receptor domains by MCP-2 (6Sozzani S. Zhou D. Locati M. Rieppi M. Proost P. Magazin M. Vita N. Van Damme J. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3615-3622Google Scholar). However, this cannot be clearly established using native cells, but requires the use of cells transfected to express only a single chemokine receptor. In this study, by determining the binding properties of radiolabeled MCP-2 and performing sensitive chemotaxis assays to assess receptor functions, we demonstrate that CCR1 and CCR2B are both functional receptors for MCP-2. Recombinant human MCP-2 and other chemokines, including Escherichia coli-derived MCP3, MCP1, MIP1α, MIP1β, and RANTES were purchased from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Radioiodinated MCP-2 was a kind gift from Dr. G. Brown (DuPont NEN). Other radioiodinated chemokines were purchased from DuPont NEN. All radioiodinated chemokines have a specific activity of 2200 Ci/mmol. Human peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from normal donors (National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Transfusion Department, Bethesda, MD) with an iso-osmotic Percoll (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) gradient as described elsewhere (17Colotta F. Bersani L. Lazzarin A. Poli G. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 3524-3530Google Scholar). Elutriated monocytes (kind gifts from Dr. I. Espinoza-Gaetano, NCI) were also used in the study. The monocyte preparations were >90% pure as assessed by morphological criteria. The CCR1 cDNA clone was isolated as described previously from a natural killer-like cell line YT (12Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Google Scholar). The CCR2B cDNA was a kind gift provided by Dr. I. F. Charo (San Francisco, CA; Ref. 15Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Google Scholar). The 293 human embryonic kidney epithelial cell line (HEK 293, a gift from Dr. P. Gray, ICOS Corp., Bothell, WA) was grown in monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD) with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and antibiotics. The HEK 293 cells were either transfected with 5–20 μg of CCR1 cDNA by using DOTAP transfection reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) or with CCR2B cDNA by electroporation (1 × 107 cells, 950 microfarads, 0.2 KV). Stable transfectants were established by adding G418 (800 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) to maintain selection pressure and were designated CCR1/293 or CCR2B/293 cells. Binding assays were performed by using a single concentration of125I-labeled chemokines in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligands as described previously (12Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Google Scholar, 19Xu L. McVicar D.W. Ben-Baruch A. Kuhns D.B. Johnston J. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2612-2617Google Scholar). The binding data were then analyzed with a Macintosh computer program LIGAND (P. Munson, Division of Computer Research and Technology, NIH, Bethesda, MD). The rate of competition for binding by unlabeled chemokines was calculated as follows: % competition for binding = 1 − (counts/min obtained in the presence of unlabeled ligand/cpm obtained in the absence of unlabeled ligand) × 100%. Monocyte migration was evaluated by using a 48-well microchamber technique as described (12Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Google Scholar, 18Falk W. Goodwin Jr., R.H. Leonard E.J.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 33: 239-246Google Scholar, 19Xu L. McVicar D.W. Ben-Baruch A. Kuhns D.B. Johnston J. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2612-2617Google Scholar). The migration of HEK 293 cells transfected with cDNA clones was also assessed by a 48-well microchamber technique (12Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Google Scholar). Data were presented as the chemotaxis index and were the representative of at least five experiments performed. The chemotaxis index was calculated by: chemotaxis index = number of cells migrating to chemokines/number of cells migrating to medium. The significance of the difference between test and control groups was analyzed by using the Student's t test. Recombinant human MCP-2 (PeproTech, lot number 85411) was highly effective in inducing human monocyte migration in vitro at an optimal concentration range of 6–12 nm (50–100 ng/ml) (data not shown). This recombinant human MCP-2 did not induce significant calcium mobilization in monocytes at concentrations below 60 nm (500 ng/ml) (not shown) as reported previously (3Proost P. Van Damme J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 67-74Google Scholar,6Sozzani S. Zhou D. Locati M. Rieppi M. Proost P. Magazin M. Vita N. Van Damme J. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3615-3622Google Scholar), even though it did induce calcium flux at concentrations of 6–12 nm in a cultured murine T lymphoma cell line (data not shown). 125I-MCP-2, prepared using the recombinant protein of the same lot number, induced monocytes chemotaxis comparable with that of the unlabeled ligand, indicating that radioiodination did not significantly change the molecular structure of the MCP-2 and its capacity to interact with receptors. It is therefore possible to examine whether human leukocytes express specific binding sites for MCP-2 and whether these binding sites are shared by multiple C-C chemokines as suggested by various investigators (6Sozzani S.

Fig.1 A shows a typical binding profile of125I-MCP-2 to monocytes with an estimatedK d value of 2 nm. The binding of125I-MCP-2 to monocytes was efficiently displaced by MCP-2 itself, and also by MCP-1 and MCP-3 (Fig. 1 B), two C-C chemokines with high degree of homology with MCP-2 (1Van Damme J. Proost P. Lenaerts J.-P. Opdenkker G. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 59-65Google Scholar, 2Decock B. Conings R. Lenaerts J.-P. Billiau A. Van Damme J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

MIP-1α and RANTES, which share about 30% homology with MCP-2, only partially displaced 125I-MCP-2 binding (Fig. 1 B). MIP-1β and C-X-C chemokine IL-8 did not compete for 125I-MCP-2 binding sites on monocytes. Our data obtained with monocytes support the suggestion that MCP-2 interacts with receptors shared by multiple C-C chemokines (6Sozzani S. Zhou D. Locati M. Rieppi M. Proost P. Magazin M. Vita N.

The parental HEK 293 cells and cells transfected with vector alone did not bind 125I-MCP-2, nor did they migrate in response to any of the C-C chemokines, including MCP-2 (Ref. 12Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Google Scholar and data not shown). HEK 293 cells stably transfected with CCR1 (CCR1/293 cells) showed a high level of specific binding for125I-MCP-2 (Fig. 2 A) and also bound radiolabeled MIP-1α (Fig. 2 B) and MCP-3 (Ref. 12Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Google Scholar). The binding affinity of 125I-MCP-2 for CCR1/293 cells is comparable with 125I-MIP-1α (K d = 5 ±2 nm and 4 ± 0.8 nm, respectively, Fig.2, A and B), but lower than125I-MCP-3 (K d = 0.7 nm, Ref. 12Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Google Scholar). Cross-competition experiments, as shown in Fig.2 C, indicate that MCP-3, MIP-1α, and RANTES are all effective competitors for 125I-MCP-2 binding to CCR1/293 cells with IC50 values of about 5 nm, comparable with MCP-2 itself. MIP-1β had very limited effect. To our surprise, MCP-1, which was a weak competitor for MCP-3, or MIP-1α/RANTES binding to CCR1/293 cells (12Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Google Scholar, 13Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Google Scholar), displaced rather effectively the 125I-MCP-2 binding to CCR1/293 cells (Fig.2 C), suggesting MCP-2 may share certain binding domains on CCR1 that react with MCP-1. In fact, MCP-1 at high concentrations did induce signaling in CCR1 (13Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Google Scholar) and partially displaced MCP-3 binding (12Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Google Scholar). Unlabeled MCP-2 fully displaced radiolabeled MIP-1α and RANTES binding to CCR1/293 cells (not shown). However, MCP-2 was a less potent competitor for binding of radiolabeled MCP-3 to CCR1/293 cells with an IC50 10 times higher than that of MCP-3 itself (15 nm versus 1.5 nm, not shown), in agreement with the relatively lower binding affinity of MCP-2 to CCR1/293 cells than MCP-3. Our efforts to obtain reproducible calcium mobilization in chemokine receptor-transfected 293 cells were not successful. We therefore utilized chemotaxis assays as a functional indicator, which has been shown to be a specific, sensitive, and physiologically relevant method of assessing the action of chemokines on their receptors (12Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Google Scholar, 20Ben-Baruch A. Bengali K.M. Bira A. Johnston J.J. Wang J.M. Kim J. Chuntharapai A.

Fig. 3 A shows that MCP-2 induced significant migration of CCR1/293 cells in vitro. The MCP-2 concentrations required to elicit optimal cell response ranged from 6 to 12 nm (50–100 ng/ml), comparable with those of MIP-1α and RANTES (12Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Google Scholar), but higher than effective MCP-3 concentrations (12Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Google Scholar). A complete cross-attenuation of migration of CCR1/293 cells was achieved by placing equal concentrations of MCP-2, MCP-3, or MIP-1α in upper and/or lower wells of the chemotaxis chamber (not shown). The capacity of MCP-2 to compete for MCP-1 binding sites and cross-desensitize one another on native leukocytes pointed to the possibility that MCP-2 also interacted with MCP-1 binding sites (6Sozzani S.

Stafford S. Heinrich J. Bravo R. Proost P. Van Damme J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3155-3159Google Scholar). This is supported by the binding data of 125I-MCP-2 to monocytes obtained in this study. Previous study showed no effect of MCP-2 on CCR2B/293 cells based on the inability of MCP-2 to induce calcium flux in these cells and to desensitize the effect of MCP-1 (16Franci C. Wong L.M. Van Damme J. Proost P. Charo I.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6511-6517Google Scholar,26Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Van Damme J. Tiffani H.L. Gao J.-L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29671-29675Google Scholar). However, in this study, we observed that 125I-MCP-2 did specifically bind to CCR2B/293 cells (3 ± 1 nm, Fig. 4 A), although the binding affinity of125I-MCP-2 to CCR2B/293 cells was relatively lower than that of 125I-MCP-1 (0.5 ± 0.1 nm, Fig.4 B). 125I-MCP-2 binding was fully displaced by both MCP-1 and MCP-3 (Fig. 4 C), but only slightly by MIP-1α (Fig. 4 C), not by RANTES or MIP-1β (not shown). Unlabeled MCP-2 was able to completely displace the binding of125I-MCP-3 on CCR2B/293 cells with slightly higher IC50 (5 versus 3 nm) than MCP-3 itself. However, unlabeled MCP-2 appeared to be a poor competitor (IC50 > 50 nm) for 125I-MCP-1 binding to CCR2B/293 cells. This may be explained by a lower affinity of MCP-2 binding to CCR2B/293 cells than MCP-1. Or alternatively, there exists differential occupancy of binding domains on CCR2B by MCP-1 and MCP-2. Studies on the binding pattern of C-X-C chemokines, IL-8, and NAP-2, on IL-8 receptor type B (CXCR2) showed that IL-8 completely displaced NAP-2 binding, whereas IL-8 binding was only partially displaced by NAP-2 (21Ben-Baruch A. Bengali K. Tani K. Xu L. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 37-45Google Scholar), even though both ligands are functional for CXCR2. Computer modeling suggested that IL-8 possesses multiple binding domains, only some of these may be shared by NAP-2 (21Ben-Baruch A. Bengali K. Tani K. Xu L. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 37-45Google Scholar). We further examined the function of MCP-2 on CCR2B/293 cells by its capacity to induce directional cell migration. CCR2B/293 cells showed highly reproducible and potent chemotactic responses to MCP-2 as well as to MCP-1 and MCP-3 (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, the chemotactic activity of these three MCPs for CCR2B/293 cells was attenuatated by each of the ligands (not shown), in agreement with previously reported results obtained in monocytes (6Sozzani S. Zhou D. Locati M. Rieppi M. Proost P. Magazin M. Vita N. Van Damme J. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3615-3622Google Scholar). However, at least 5-fold more MCP-2 was required to completely attenuate the migration of CCR2B/293 cells to MCP-1, in correlation with the binding competition pattern (see above). Thus our binding and chemotaxis data indicate that CCR2B is also a functional receptor for MCP-2 and the functional domains on CCR2B differentially interact with MCP-2 and MCP-1. The significance of MCP-2 production in pathophysiological conditions has yet to be defined (3Proost P. Van Damme J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 67-74Google Scholar). MCP-2 is constitutively expressed in tumor cells and is inducible by proinflammatory cytokines in mononuclear cells and fibroblasts (1Van Damme J. Proost P. Lenaerts J.-P. Opdenkker G. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 59-65Google Scholar, 2Decock B. Conings R. Lenaerts J.-P. Billiau A. Van Damme J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 904-909Google Scholar, 3Proost P. Van Damme J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 67-74Google Scholar). MCP-2, like MCP-3, exhibits a broader spectrum of targeted cells, including cells of dendritic phenotype as we recently reported (22Xu L. Warren M.K. Rose W.L. Gong W. Wang J.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 365-371Google Scholar). Therefore, MCP-2 may play an important role in recruiting/activating immune cells at inflammatory and neoplastic foci. In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time with cloned CCR1 and CCR2B that MCP-2 is a functional ligand for at least these two receptors. Other data based on native cells suggested the possible existence of additional receptors used by MCP-2 (7Uguccioni M. D'Apuzzo M. Loetscher M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 64-68Google Scholar, 8Weber M. Uguccioni M. Ochensberger B. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. Dahinden C.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4166-4172Google Scholar). This possibility was also evidenced by our experiments with a murine T lymphoma cell line, in which MCP-2 totally desensitized MCP-1-, MCP-3-, as well as MIP-1α-induced calcium flux but not the vice versa. 2J. M. Wang, S. Sozzani, and D. B. Kuhns, unpublished observation. Efforts are being made to identify additional receptors for MCP-2. Although MCP-2 is a poor Ca2+ flux inducer in human monocytes (Refs. 3Proost P. Van Damme J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 67-74Google Scholar and 6Sozzani S. Zhou D. Locati M. Rieppi M. Proost P. Magazin M. Vita N. Van Damme J. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3615-3622Google Scholar and data not shown), we were able to obtain significant Ca2+flux in murine T lymphoma cells induced by MCP-2, suggesting that different cell types may exhibit agonist-dependent Ca2+ signaling capacity, but the end result in terms of cell migration is the same. Our current data obtained with CCR2B/293 cells again show that chemotaxis assay provides a powerful approach to defining the ligand-receptor interaction with 293 cells transfected to express a single chemokine receptor, as we have reported previously for both C-C and C-X-C chemokines (12Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengali K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Google Scholar, 20Ben-Baruch A. Bengali K.M. Bira A. Johnston J.J. Wang J.M. Kim J. Chuntharapai A.

Recently, several chemokine receptors have been reported to function as HIV-1 fusion co-factors, and some chemokines were able to interfere with the viral replication (reviewed in Ref. 25Bates P. Cell. 1996; 86: 1-3Google Scholar). Investigation into the shared and unique functional domains on both chemokine ligands and receptors will prove important in the development of therapeutic approaches to chemokine- and chemokine receptor-mediated pathology.

Upon the mutation F77L, diazepam and Ro 15-1788 retained the ability to interact with the benzodiazepine binding site, but zolpidem lost this ability. To quantify these data, radioligand binding experiments were performed using membrane preparations of transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The amino acid γ77, phenylalanine, was also mutated to tyrosine, tryptophan, and isoleucine. Although there was little effect on Ro 15-1788 binding upon mutation to tyrosine, the loss in affinity for diazepam was from 12 to 2,720 nm. The change to leucine, in contrast, resulted in little change in the diazepam affinity, whereas there was a strongly reduced affinity for zolpidem from 17 to 4,870 nm and for methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) from 1.9 to 1,780 nm, respectively. The change to tryptophan resulted in two-phasic displacement curves, and only about 50% of the [3H]flunitrazepam binding could be displaced by zolpidem, DMCM, and Ro 15-1788, respectively, whereas midazolam and diazepam still resulted in 100% displacement, indicating the presence of two sites upon expression of this mutant receptor. Functional expression inXenopus oocytes showed that all mutant channels displayed a comparatively small change (<4.3-fold) in their apparent agonist affinity and that these channels could still be functionally modulated by ligands of the benzodiazepine binding site. We conclude that subtle changes in γF77 drastically affect benzodiazepine pharmacology and that this residue probably interacts directly with most ligands of the benzodiazepine binding site and therefore defines part of the benzodiazepine binding pocket.

GABAA 1The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; DMCM, methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylate. receptors are the major ion channels in mammalian brain conferring neuronal inhibition. Two subunits have initially been purified (1Sigel E. Stephenson F.A. Mamalaki C. Barnard E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6965-6971Google Scholar), and their coding DNA has been cloned (2Schofield P.R. Darlison M.G. Fujita N. Burt D.R. Stephenson F.A. Rodriguez H. Rhee L.M. Ramachandran J. Reale V. Glencorse T.A. Seeburg P.H. Barnard E.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 221-227Google Scholar). Later, a total of 15 mammalian subunits have been cloned (for reviews, see Refs. 3Burt D.R. Kamatchi G.L. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2916-2923Google Scholar, 4Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev.

They are homologous to subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, of the glycine receptor, and the serotonin type 3 receptor, and it is assumed that the natural receptor is a pentameric protein (8Nayeem N. Green T.P. Martin I.L. Barnard E.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 815-818Google Scholar). The GABAA receptor is the site of action of benzodiazepines and related compounds (Fig. 1; for review, see Ref. 6Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-233Google Scholar). There is a widespread use of some benzodiazepines for their anxiolytic, sedative, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsive properties, and the structural determinants underlying benzodiazepine action are of interest. Clinically used, sedative benzodiazepines act as positive allosteric modulators of the receptor. The α1 subunit has been described as the major subunit that is photoaffinity labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam (9Stephenson F.A. Duggan M.J. Pollard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21160-21165Google Scholar), and one major labeled amino acid has been identified (10Duncalfe L.L. Carpenter M.R. Smillie L.B. Martin I.L. Dunn M.S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9209-9214Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations,in vitro binding studies identified several amino acid residues in α1, α3, α4, and α6 to be involved in benzodiazepine binding (11Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1421-1425Google Scholar, 12Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar, 13Korpi E.R. Kleingoor C. Kettenmann H.

In addition, a γ subunit is required for functional modulation of the channels by benzodiazepines (15Pritchett D.B. Sontheimer H. Shivers B.D. Ymer S. Kettenmann H. Schofield P.R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1989; 338: 582-585Google Scholar, 16Sigel E. Baur R. Trube G. Möhler H. Malherbe P. Neuron. 1990; 5: 703-711Google Scholar). Point mutations in the γ2 subunit also affect the benzodiazepine pharmacology (17Mihic S.J. Whiting P.J. Klein R.L. Wafford K.A. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32768-32773Google Scholar,18Buhr A. Baur R. Malherbe P. Sigel E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1080-1084Google Scholar) in these functional experiments. The view that γ subunits are essential for the formation of the benzodiazepine binding site was recently confirmed with γ2-less mice (19Günther U. Benson J. Benke D. Fritschy J.-M. Reyes G. Knoflach F. Crestani F. Aguzzi A. Arigoni M. Lang Y. Bluethmann H. Mohler H. Lüscher B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7749-7753Google Scholar). Thus, α and γ subunits are both thought to contribute to the benzodiazepine binding site, but its structural localization remains to be described. The imidazopyridine zolpidem selectively binds to α1-containing GABAA receptors and is able to displace diazepam there (20Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1802-1804Google Scholar). The α2 and α3 subunits confer intermediate zolpidem affinity and the α5 subunit very low affinity to triple subunit combinations αxβ2γ2 (21Carter D.B. Thomsen D.R. Im W.B. Lennon D.J. Ngo D.M.

Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1211-1218Google Scholar). That the γ subunit may indeed contribute to the zolpidem site is substantiated by the observation that zolpidem displays very low affinity to γ3, in contrast to γ2-containing receptors (24Herb A. Wisden W. Lüddens H. Puia G. Vicini S. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1433-1437Google Scholar, 25Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. Korpi E.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 810-814Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified the amino acid side chains α1 161 and α1 206, and γ2 77 as important for increased stimulatory effects of diazepam in α1β2γ2 receptor channels expressed inXenopus oocytes at the functional level (18Buhr A. Baur R. Malherbe P. Sigel E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1080-1084Google Scholar). Interestingly, γF77L resulted in an almost complete loss of zolpidem effects. We attempted to understand this phenomenon better. We report drastic consequences of four different point mutations of the wild type phenylalanine in the γ2 subunit for ligand specificity of the benzodiazepine binding site. Some binding data indicate the presence of two benzodiazepine binding sites. A probable way of interaction of the wild type channel with different ligands is discussed. Our work represents an initial step leading to a rational drug design based on the identification of structural determinants on the receptor protein. The cDNAs coding for the α1, β2, and γ2S subunits of the rat GABAAreceptor channel have been described elsewhere (26Lolait S.J. O'Carroll A.-M. Kusano K. Muller J.-M. Brownstein M.J. Mahan L.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 246: 145-148Google Scholar, 27Malherbe P. Draguhn A. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Möhler H. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 8: 199-208Google Scholar, 28Malherbe P. Sigel E. Baur R. Persohn E. Richards J.G. Möhler H. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2330-2337Google Scholar). The mutant γF77L has a phenylalanine to leucine substitution at position 77 of the mature peptide and has been described before (18Buhr A. Baur R. Malherbe P. Sigel E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1080-1084Google Scholar,29Sigel E. Baur R. Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2017-2023Google Scholar). The mutant subunits γF77Y, γF77I, and γF77W were prepared using the QuikChangeTMmutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For cell transfection, the cDNAs were subcloned into the polylinker of pBC/CMV (30Bertocci B. Miggiano V. Da Prada M. Dembic Z. Lahm H.-W. Malherbe P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The α subunit was cloned into theEcoRI, and the β and γ subunits were subcloned into theSmaI site of the polylinker by standard techniques. Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared, injected, defoliculated, and currents recorded as described (18Buhr A. Baur R. Malherbe P. Sigel E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1080-1084Google Scholar, 31Sigel E. J. Physiol. 1987; 386: 73-90Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were injected with 50 nl of capped, polyadenylated cRNA dissolved in 5 mmK-HEPES (pH 6.8). This solution contained the transcripts coding for each of the different subunits at a concentration of 100 nm(calculated from the UV absorption) to allow injection of about stoichiometric amounts. Electrophysiological experiments were performed by the two-electrode voltage-clamp method at a holding potential of −80 mV. To quantify GABA sensitivity, agonist concentrations between 0.03 and 10,000 μm were applied for 20 s, and a washout period of 4–15 min was allowed to ensure full recovery from desensitization. Current responses were fitted to the Hill equation:I = Imax /(1 + (EC50/[A])n , where Iis the current amplitude at a given concentration of GABA (A), I max is the maximum current amplitude, EC50 is the concentration of agonist yielding half-maximal current amplitudes, and n is the Hill coefficient. Allosteric potentiation via the benzodiazepine site was measured at a GABA concentration eliciting 5–15% of the maximal GABA current amplitude by coapplication of GABA and the drugs acting at the benzodiazepine binding site. Ro 15-1788, in contrast to the other ligands of the benzodiazepine binding site used here, developed its effects not instantaneously. Therefore, it was preapplied for 30 s to ensure a rapid onset of action upon perfusion with GABA. Unless mentioned otherwise, oocytes were only exposed to a single drug in addition to GABA, to avoid contamination, and the perfusion system was cleaned by washing with dimethyl sulfoxide for the same reason. The cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin by standard cell culture techniques. Equal amounts (total of 20 μg of DNA/90-mm dish) of plasmids coding for GABAA receptor subunits were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (32Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). After overnight incubation, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and refed with medium. Wild type receptor and triple subunit combinations expressed well as indicated by the respective B max of 1.1–6.0 pmol binding sites/mg of protein, with an average of 2.9 ± 1.4 pmol, as determined by radioligand binding assays. An exception was the tryptophan mutant, which resulted in the expression of 0.59–0.64 pmol binding sites/mg of protein. Approximately 60 h after transfection the cells were harvested by washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) and centrifuged at 150 ×g. Cells were washed with buffer containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm K-EDTA (pH 7.4). Cells were homogenized by sonication in the presence of 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm EDTA. Membranes were collected by three centrifugation-resuspension cycles (100,000 × g for 20 min) and then used for ligand binding or stored at −20 °C. Resuspended cell membranes (0.2–0.5 ml) were incubated for 90 min on ice in the presence of [3H]Ro 15-1788 (87 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) or [3H]flunitrazepam (86 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) and various concentations of competing ligands. Membranes (20–80 μg of protein/filter) were collected by rapid filtration on GF/C filters presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine. After three washing steps with 4 ml of buffer, the filter-retained radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm Ro 15-1788 or 10 μmflunitrazepam, respectively. Data were fitted by using a nonlinear least squares method to the equation B(c) =Bmax · c/(Kd +c) for binding curves and B(c) = B max/(1 + (c/IC50)n) for displacement curves with a single component, where c is the concentration of ligand; B, binding;B max, maximal binding; K d, dissociation constant; and n, Hill coefficient. Displacement curves IC50 values were converted to K i values according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation (33Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Google Scholar). In the case of the tryptophan mutant, for some ligands assuming two components yielded the better fit. Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as standard. The dual subunit combination α1β2 or triple subunit combinations α1β2γ2 were functionally expressed inXenopus oocytes and characterized using electrophysiological techniques. Diazepam displays approximately a 3-fold enhancement of the stimulation of GABA currents after the point mutation F77L in the γ subunit, whereas zolpidem almost lost the ability to affect GABA currents (18; Table TableI). The effects of all compounds tested were independent of the size of the current amplitude expressed from a given subunit combination or the time point after injection of the oocytes with the corresponding cRNAs.Table IEffect of benzodiazepine binding site ligands on GABA currentsSubstance(s)Relative currentsαβαβγαβγF77L%1 μmdiazepam103 ± 7149 ± 29216 ± 271 μm zolpidem105 ± 8158 ± 46111 ± 51 μm diazepam + 1 μm Ro 15–1788—1-a—, not determined.—100 ± 80.3 μm diazepam + 3 μmzolpidem— 1-a—, not determined.—206 ± 11The effect of benzodiazepine binding site ligands on GABA currents was measured as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” Data are given as mean ± S.D. of at least five determinations performed in at least two batches of oocytes.1-a —, not determined. Open table in a new tab The effect of benzodiazepine binding site ligands on GABA currents was measured as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” Data are given as mean ± S.D. of at least five determinations performed in at least two batches of oocytes. It was interesting to know whether zolpidem fails to bind mutated channels or whether the zolpidem still binds and only fails to stimulate GABA currents in these channels. To answer this question, we performed competition experiments and tried to counteract the stimulatory effects of 1 μm diazepam with increasing amounts of zolpidem or of the antagonist Ro 15-1788 in cumulative dose-response curves, respectively (data not shown). 1 μm Ro 15-1788 did not alter GABA responses in mutant and wild type channels. In Fig. 2 A it is shown that 1 μm Ro 15-1788 can completely reverse the stimulatory effect of diazepam. In contrast to this observation, the effect of 0.3 μm diazepam cannot be reduced by 3 μmzolpidem (Fig. 2 B and Table TableI). This lower concentration of diazepam was chosen from a dose-response curve for the stimulation of GABA currents by diazepam and results in about 70% of the maximal stimulation in mutant channels (18Buhr A. Baur R. Malherbe P. Sigel E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1080-1084Google Scholar). Based on our experiments, we conclude that Ro 15-1788 can but zolpidem cannot compete with diazepam in mutant αβγF77L channels. These electrophysiological experiments resulted in a good description of functional effects, but only in a qualitative assessment of the interaction with ligands of the benzodiazepine binding site with the GABAA receptor. A quantitative description of the binding was obtained using equilibrium binding of [3H]Ro 15-1788 to membrane preparations of human embryonic kidney cells transiently transfected with α1β2γ2 GABAA receptor cDNAs or transfected with the triple combination containing the mutant γF77L subunit. Binding occurred in each case to a single class of binding sites (Fig. 3 A). The affinity for Ro 15-1788 was reduced about 28-fold in the mutant channels compared with the wild type combination (TableTableII). However, it should be noted that the affinity for this ligand was still relatively high (17 nm). The binding specificities of wild type and mutant receptors were analyzed for a number of other modulatory drugs acting at the benzodiazepine binding site. Data are summarized in Table TableII. The affinity for the non-benzodiazepine ligands tested was most affected, displayingK i values above 1 μm. In contrast, diazepam retained medium affinity (about an 8-fold decrease). Most remarkably, the affinity of the β-carboline DMCM was decreased 940-fold for the mutant receptor (Fig. 3 B and Table TableII). The affinities for zolpidem and Cl 218872 were reduced 325- and 130-fold, respectively. Best fit was obtained assuming a Hill coefficient of 1.0 in all cases. Thus, all drugs tested displaced [3H]Ro 15-1788 apparently by binding to a single, noncooperative site and displaced the radioactive ligand to the same extent as high concentrations of nonradioactive Ro 15-1788.Table IIBinding affinities of different benzodiazepine binding site ligandsSubunit CombinationK d orK i (relative affinity)Ro 15–1788DiazepamFlunitrazepamMidazolamZolpidemCl 218872DMCMnmαβγ0.61 ± 0.2412 ± 83.0 ± 0.81.8 ± 0.0415 ± 346 ± 1.31.9 ± 0.03(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)αβγF77Y0.97 ± 0.032,716 ± 0502 ± 2251 ± 35.4 ± 0.16.6 ± 0.792 ± 14(1.6)(230)(170)(140)(0.36)(0.14)(48)αβγF77L17 ± 292 ± 217.2 ± 3.2ND2-aND, not determined.4,870 ± 506,100 ± 1,3001,780 ± 760(28)(7.7)(2.4)(−)(325)(130)(940)αβγF77I1,233 ± 5255 ± 4.34.5 ± 0.715 ± 1.2>10,000>10,000>10,000(2,020)(4.6)(1.5)(8.3)(>600)(>200)(>5,000)αβγF77WSite 1530 ± 220300 ± 272-bData were fitted with a Hill coefficient of 0.7, maybe indicating the presence of two binding sites with different affinity.18 ± 4.32-cSaturation binding data could be fitted satisfactorily with a Hill coefficient of 1.0.ND 2-aND, not determined.22 ± 13>10,00084 ± 9.5(870)(25)(6.0)(−)(1.5)(>200)(44)Site 2>10,000>10,000>10,000>10,000(>15,000)(>600)(>200)(>5,000)K d values for the wild type receptor and the Y and L mutant-containing receptors were determined by binding of [3H]Ro 15–1788 and the W and I mutant-containing receptors by binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to washed membranes of transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells.

Data are mean ± S.D. of two determinations performed in triplicate. Further point mutants were then prepared and studied in the same way. Fig. 4 shows a similar experiment comparing the binding of [3H]Ro 15-1788 to wild type receptors and receptors containing the mutated γF77Y subunit. Although there was very little effect on Ro 15-1788 affinity (Fig. 4 A), the displacement of [3H]Ro 15-1788 by diazepam (Fig. 4 B) was drastically affected, showing a 230-fold decrease in diazepam affinity (Fig. 4 B and Table TableII). Interestingly, the same mutation resulted in an about a 7- and 3-fold increase in Cl 218872 and zolpidem affinity, respectively (Table TableII). Besides the mentioned ligands, midazolam, flunitrazepam, and DMCM were also characterized in the same way, and the results are summarized in Table TableII. All curves were fitted satisfactorily assuming a Hill coefficient of 1.0. [3H]Ro 15-1788 displayed no specific binding after expression of the isoleucine mutant-containing triple subunit combination. Using [3H]flunitrazepam, we obtained evidence for the presence of a single type of binding site with almost the same affinity as wild type receptors (Table TableII). Comparison of receptors containing isoleucine and leucine instead of the wild type phenylalanine surprisingly shows little difference in apparent diazepam affinity, whereas there is 74-fold difference in Ro 15-1788 affinity and a 2,020-fold difference to wild type receptors (Table TableII). Other non-benzodiazepines displayed no measurable affinity to the isoleucine-containing mutant. The loss in DMCM affinity of >5,000-fold for the change from wild type to the isoleucine mutant is the largest effect observed here (Table TableII). Again, all curves were fitted satisfactorily assuming a Hill coefficient of 1.0. [3H]Ro 15-1788 displayed again no specific binding after expression of this triple subunit combination. Saturation binding curves using [3H]flunitrazepam revealed at least a 6-fold reduced affinity compared with wild type receptors, with a K d of 18 nm. Displacement curves were in this case measured at 6 nm. As indicated under “Materials and Methods,” this mutant resulted in about 20% of the normally observed expression. A tryptophan residue in this position may interfere somewhat with the biosynthesis or assembly in this expression system. Whereas midazolam and diazepam displaced radioactive flunitrazepam to the same extent as did nonradioactive flunitrazepam, zolpidem, Ro 15-1788, and DMCM displaced only 40–60%. The affinity of zolpidem for this partial displacement was about the same as in the wild type, and the affinities for DMCM and Ro 15-1788 were strongly decreased (TableTableII). The displacement curve for diazepam was fitted with a Hill coefficient of 0.64, which may indicate the presence of more than one site having a slightly different affinity for diazepam. Cl 218872 almost lost the ability to bind to the mutated receptor (Table TableII). The displacement curves for diazepam, zolpidem, and Cl 218872 are illustrated in Fig. 5. Obviously, there are two binding sites with different properties present. The implications of this heterogeneous behavior is discussed further below. Triple subunit combinations αβγ were expressed functionally inXenopus oocytes. All mutants analyzed expressed GABA-activated chloride currents of maximal current amplitude comparable to those of wild type channels. Only a small decrease (factor of 1.6–4.3) in the apparent GABA affinity (EC50) was observed between wild type and mutant channels (TableTableIII). For the leucine mutant about a 5-fold reduced agonist affinity has been described before (29Sigel E. Baur R. Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2017-2023Google Scholar). GABA currents by wild type and mutant channels were stimulated by coapplication of 0.3 μm diazepam together with 1–3 μm GABA, indicating that all mutants studied here retain allosteric coupling to the agonist site. As expected for this concentration of diazepam, receptors containing the tyrosine substitution displayed a reduced response to diazepam but retained strong stimulation by 1 μm zolpidem (Table TableIII).Table IIIFunctional properties of receptors expressed in X. laevis oocytesSubunit combinationEC50Relative currents in the presence of0.3 μm diazepam1 μm zolpidemμm%αβγ7.8 ± 4.7 (3)156 ± 56 (5)—3-a—, not determined.αβγF77Y12.4 ± 0.7 (3)118 ± 4 (3)530 ± 69 (3)αβγF77L33.3 ± 11.4 (3)182 ± 19 (3)—αβγF77I17.3 ± 7.8 (3)180 ± 11 (3)—αβγF77W18.3 ± 11.2 (3)196 ± 40 (7)—The apparent GABA affinity (EC50) and the effect of benzodiazepine binding site ligands on GABA currents were measured as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” Data are given as mean ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab The apparent GABA affinity (EC50) and the effect of benzodiazepine binding site ligands on GABA currents were measured as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” Data are given as mean ± S.D. (no. of oocytes tested). This study demonstrates that a single amino acid in position 77 of the mature γ2 subunit of α1β2γ2 GABAA receptors drastically affects the pharmacology of benzodiazepine site ligands. Interestingly, this residue is directly homologous to α1F64, which has been implied in agonist binding (29Sigel E. Baur R. Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2017-2023Google Scholar, 34Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20380-20387Google Scholar). In the following we discuss results of a functional study, of binding experiments, and of displacement of binding by several compounds representative for the various classes of benzodiazepine site ligands, for four different mutations in this position. Expression in Xenopus oocytes of the γF77L mutant together with α1 and β2 subunits results in ion channels displaying a 3-fold increased stimulatory effect of diazepam compared with wild type channels, whereas the effect by zolpidem nearly disappears. Functional competition experiments indicate that upon mutation the antagonist Ro 15-1788 competes with diazepam in the mutated channel, but zolpidem has lost this ability. Thus, zolpidem apparently fails to bind to mutated channels, whereas Ro 15-1788 still seems to bind to these channels. This interpretation is directly supported by binding experiments to membrane preparations of transiently transfected cells. Although the affinity for zolpidem is reduced about 325-fold in the above mutant, the affinity for the antagonist Ro 15-1788 is reduced only 28-fold. From these data, it becomes clear that the concentrations of the ligands used in functional competition experiments were too low to expect displacement of diazepam in the case of zolpidem. Interestingly, the affinity for the β-carboline DMCM was almost 3 orders of magnitude lower than in wild type channels, therefore displaying the largest effect after mutation of γF77 to leucine. Of all the ligands tested, the affinity to diazepam was the least affected. Its binding affinity was reduced only about 8-fold, and it retained a medium affinity. Preliminary functional data show that 1 μm flunitrazepam similar to diazepam increases potentiation of GABA-induced currents and therefore indicate that the mutant channel still has a considerable affinity for this benzodiazepine. This suggestion was also confirmed with binding studies. Interestingly, it appears that the affinities of all benzodiazepines tested are still well below 100 nm after mutation to leucine, whereas the affinities of non-benzodiazepines are much lower (μm range). At the level of binding experiments the leucine mutant was compared with the isoleucine mutant. Although both mutant receptors displayed an affinity toward flunitrazepam similar to that of the wild type, a small decrease in diazepam affinity was observed. However, the affinity for Ro 15-1788 was affected much more strongly in the isoleucine (2,020-fold) than in the leucine (28-fold) mutant. Thus, a simple shift of a methyl group by one carbon atom leads to a 74-fold change. It would be interesting to study the alanine mutant to see whether this is the result of steric hindrance. The γ1 subunit has an isoleucine residue in the position homologous to 77 in the γ2 subunit and also has no measurable affinity for Ro 15-1788 and DMCM; but it still displays relatively high affinity for flunitrazepam. This behavior is reminiscent of our isoleucine mutation. It would be interesting to change the isoleucine in γ1 into a phenylalanine and study the consequences for the Ro 15-1788 affinity. The phenylalanine in position 77 of the γ subunit was also replaced by a more bulky amino acid. The change to tyrosine,i.e. the introduction of an additional hydroxyl group, left the affinity for Ro 15-1788 almost unaffected and even increased the affinities for zolpidem and Cl 218872, whereas the affinities for diazepam, flunitrazepam, midazolam, and DMCM were drastically decreased. This indicates that an entity in the latter, but not in the former compounds is not tolerated by the substituted aromatic ring. Furthermore, the interaction of γ77 with classical benzodiazepines and the antagonist Ro 15-1788 is different. Replacement of phenylalanine by tryptophan yielded binding data that could be interpreted as the presence of two binding sites for ligands of the benzodiazepine site on a receptor pentamer (see “Results”). This finding was surprising, as there was no indication from our binding data on other mutants for a positive or negative cooperativity between two sites. The properties of the two binding sites are very different from each other. If a γ2 subunit always takes part in the formation of a benzodiazepine binding site and there is only one drug binding site/αγ subunit interface, this would indicate the presence of two γ2 subunits in a receptor pentamer. Alternatively, the alteration at the γ2 subunit containing site would have to be communicated by allosteric mechanisms to the γ2 subunit-independent site. An alternative explanation for our data would be the existence of a second pool of receptors with different binding properties. It is however intriguing that the relative abundance of the two populations was about 1:1 in all experiments. On a functional level, after expression of the mutant channels in Xenopus oocytes, no evidence was obtained pointing to a heterogeneity of this site. Namely, cumulative dose-response curves of the stimulation of GABA currents by diazepam did not point to the presence of multiple sites (data not shown). The presence of more than one binding site on a receptor has also been postulated on the basis of an altered rate of dissociation by the same or other ligands in cerebellum (35Doble A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1982; 83: 313-316Google Scholar). However, as shown by Prinz and Striessnig (36Prinz H. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18580-18585Google Scholar), this cannot be taken as conclusive evidence for the presence of multiple sites. The best indication for the presence of multiple sites has been provided by photoaffinity labeling with [3H]flunitrazepam of brain extracts, where it has been shown that covalent binding of one molecule destroys about four sites for reversible binding (37Karobath M. Supavilai P. Neurosci. Lett. 1982; 31: 65-69Google Scholar, 38Sieghart W. Drexler G. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 47-55Google Scholar). The presence of more than one binding site on a receptor for negative allosteric modulators is also suggested from the two-phasic response to these agents in functional measurements of receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes (39Sigel E. Baur R. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 289-295Google Scholar). After functional expression in Xenopus oocytes all mutant receptors formed channels with a slightly (1.6–4.3-fold) reduced apparent affinity for the agonist GABA. The agonist binding site is allosterically coupled to the benzodiazepine binding site. In view of the relatively small changes in the apparent binding affinities for the agonist and the huge changes in the observed binding affinities for ligands of the benzodiazepine binding site, we think it more likely that the latter site is affected directly. All mutated channels were also stimulated by ligands of the benzodiazepine binding site, indicating that the allosteric interaction between this site and the agonist site was preserved. It is clear that there are large effects of the substituent present in position 77 of the γ2 subunit for the specificity of the benzodiazepine binding site. Obviously, the non-benzodiazepines prefer an aromatic substituent in position 77, and addition to the phenyl ring of a hydroxyl group even increases the affinity for zolpidem and Cl 218872. Exchange of the aromatic ring by smaller side chains results in much larger effects for non-benzodiazepines (130->5,000) than for diazepam, flunitrazepam, and midazolam (1.5–8.3). Remarkably, the loss in affinity of mutant receptors is always different between this group of three benzodiazepines and Ro 15-1788. We suggest that γ77 interacts directly with benzodiazepine binding site ligands. Obviously, different ligands interact in a different fashion with the wild type phenyl residue, but it is of course unlikely that chemically distinct ligands have identical interactions with the receptor site. As both types of ligand compete for binding, their respective binding sites have to overlap. Small chemical changes in position 77 of the γ subunit have huge effects on the benzodiazepine pharmacology. The analysis of the molecular design of the benzodiazepine binding sites should help in the understanding of how these ligands bind to the GABAA receptor. Such an analysis may provide a rational basis for drug design. The phenylalanine identified here appears to be a key determinant for the activity of zolpidem, DMCM, Cl 218872, and the binding of the antagonist Ro 15-1788 and must be very close to or part of the diazepam binding site of GABAA receptors."

Acta. 1992; 1135: 141-146Google Scholar, 11Núnez M.T. Alvarez X. Smith M. Tapia V. Glass J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1582-C1588Google Scholar, 12Han O. Failla M.L. Hill A.D. Morris E.R. Smith J.C. J. Nutr. 1994; 125: 1291-1299Google Scholar) and for the uptake of free iron in blood plasma (13Jordan I. Kaplan J. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 875-879Google Scholar, 14Oshiro S. Nakajima H. Markello T. Krasnewich D. Bernardini I. Gahl W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21586-21591Google Scholar). Mammalian cells acquire most of their iron from transferrin. Fe3+-transferrin complexes bind to transferrin receptors on the cell surface. These receptor-ligand complexes are endocytosed to an endosomal compartment; the iron is dissociated and then transported across the endosomal membrane. Some studies have suggested that transferrin-delivered Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+in the endosome and transported into the cytoplasm by Fe2+-specific transporters (15Watkins J.A. Altazan J.D. Elder P. Lin C.Y. Nunez M.T. Cui X.X. Glass J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5820-5830Google Scholar, 16Thorstensen K. Romslo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8844-8850Google Scholar, 17Nunez M.T. Escobar A. Ahumada A. Gonzalez-Sepulveda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11490-11494Google Scholar). Clearly, Fe2+ transporters play a prominent role in iron acquisition by a wide variety of organisms. In S. cerevisiae, extracellular Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ by the plasma membrane Fe3+ reductases encoded by the FRE1 and FRE2 genes (18Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Google Scholar, 19Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Google Scholar). The Fe2+ product is then taken up by either of two transport systems. One system has a high affinity for iron (apparentK m of 0.15 μm), is necessary for iron-limited growth, and requires the products of the FET3and FTR1 genes for activity (20Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Google Scholar, 21Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar, 22De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Google Scholar, 23Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The high affinity system is induced in iron-limited cells, and its components are transcriptionally regulated by the product of the AFT1 gene (24Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Google Scholar). AFT1 is an iron-responsive DNA binding protein that activates transcription of the target promoters to which it binds (25Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Google Scholar). Iron-replete yeast cells obtain iron through a second, low affinity uptake system with an apparent K m of 30 μm. This system requires the FET4 gene for activity. Our previous results suggested that FET4 is the low affinity Fe2+ transporter (26Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Google Scholar). First, overexpression of theFET4 gene increased activity of an iron uptake system that was indistinguishable from the low affinity system. Second, disruption of the FET4 gene eliminated low affinity uptake activity but did not diminish high affinity activity. Finally, the sequence of theFET4 gene suggested that its product is a transporter protein. The predicted FET4 amino acid sequence is 552 residues in length and contains over 50% hydrophobic amino acids. Many of these hydrophobic residues are arranged in six regions that may be transmembrane domains. FET4 has no homology to any known protein including FTR1, the feoB Fe2+ transporter ofEscherichia coli (27Kammler M. Schon C. Hantke K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6212-6219Google Scholar), and the IRT1Fe2+ transporter from Arabidopsis thaliana (28Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Google Scholar). Therefore, while the hydrophobic character of FET4 suggested that it is a transporter, we could not rule out other models of FET4 function. The central goal of the experiments described in this report was to further test the hypothesis that FET4 encodes the Fe2+transporter of the low affinity system. Yeast strains used wereDY1457 (MATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3), DEY1394 (MATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 fet3-2::HIS3), DEY1422 (MATa can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 fet4-1::LEU2), DEY1446 (MATa can1 his3 leu2 ura3 fet4-1::LEU2 trp1::YIpGAL1-FET4), DDY4 (MATa ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 fet3-2::HIS3 fet4–1::LEU2), DEY1514 T1 (MATa/MATα ade2/+ ade6/+ can1/can1 his3/his3 leu2/leu2 trp1/trp1::YIpGAL1-FET4 ura3/ura3), and DEY1515 (MATa/MATα ade2/+ can1/can1 his3/his3 leu2/leu2 trp1/trp1 ura3/ura3 fet4-1::LEU2/fet4-1::LEU2). Cells were grown in 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone (YP) or synthetic defined (SD) medium (6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base) supplemented with any necessary auxotrophic requirements and either 2% glucose or 2% galactose. Cells were also grown in a modified iron-limited medium (LIM, Ref. 29Eide D. Guarente L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 347-354Google Scholar) prepared without EDTA (i.e. LIM-EDTA) and supplemented with FeCl3 to the stated concentrations. LIM-EDTA is iron limiting for growth of fet3 mutant strains when supplemented with less than 10 μm FeCl3 (data not shown) because of its high concentration (20 mm) of citrate, an iron-binding chelator. Yeast and E. coli transformations were performed using standard methods (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.74-1.84Google Scholar, 31Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Google Scholar). The locations of potential transmembrane domains and the orientation of FET4 were predicted using TOP-PREDII software (32Claros M.G. Von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686Google Scholar). Three segments of the FET4 protein, i.e. amino acids 1–60 (pGEMEX-N), 120–220 (pGEMEX-L1), and 410–460 (pGEMEX-L5), were selected as antigens. DNA fragments corresponding to these regions were obtained using polymerase chain reaction primers with appropriate restriction sites added to their 5′ ends and cloned into pGEMEX-1 (Promega). In-frame cloning of these inserts into this vector produced genes in which the bacteriophage gene 10 protein is fused to the FET4 peptide. The fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS as described by Studier et al. (33Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a Bio-Rad 491 Prep Cell. Rabbits were injected subcutaneously with 100 μg of semi-purified fusion protein in adjuvant. Anti-FET4 antibodies were affinity purified against their corresponding gene 10-FET4 fusion protein by column chromatography (34Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 514-551Google Scholar). ABamHI-SacI fragment bearing the FET4open reading frame was generated by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pLO-LB (L. Opresko, University of Utah) to generate pLO-LBFET4. In vitro transcription/translation was performed using the TnT system (Promega). Cells were grown to exponential phase (100 ml,A 600 of 2–4), spheroplasts were prepared (35Yaffe M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Google Scholar), resuspended in 10 ml of 0.6 m mannitol, 20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin A, and disrupted in a Dounce homogenizer. Total cell homogenates were obtained by centrifuging these samples at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and discarding the pellet of unbroken cells. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 123,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to yield the soluble (supernatant) and particulate/membrane (pellet) fractions. Sucrose density gradient fractionation was performed as described previously (36Kölling R. Hollenberg C.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3261-3271Google Scholar). One ml of total cell homogenate (approximately 1 mg of protein) was loaded onto the top of linear sucrose gradients (20–55% w/w). The gradients were centrifuged for 16 h at 110,000 × g in an SW41 rotor at 4 °C. Fractions (700 μl each) were collected sequentially from the top of the gradients beginning with fraction 1. Immunoblots were performed as described previously (34Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 514-551Google Scholar) using primary antibodies specific to FET4, PMA1 (37Capieaux E. Rapin C. Thines D. Dupont Y. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21895-21900Google Scholar), HMG1 (38Wright R. Basson M. D'Ari L. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 101-114Google Scholar), VPH1 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and OMP2 (G. Schatz, Basel). Unless stated otherwise, anti-L1 was used for detection of FET4. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce) was used as the secondary antibody; protein-antibody complexes were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). Densitometric scanning was performed using a CCD camera and IMAGE 1.44 software (National Institutes of Health). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed essentially as described by Pringle et al. (39Pringle J.R. Adams A.E.M. Drubin D. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were fixed in 10 volumes of cold methanol (−20 °C) for 30 min. Fixed cells were treated with glusulase to remove the cell wall and bound to polylysine-treated coverslips. Primary antibody staining was performed by incubating the cells with affinity-purified anti-FET4 antibodies (1:200 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline) at room temperature for 16 h. Following washing of the cells, goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Pierce) was applied (1:200 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. This was followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h with streptavidin-conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate (Zymed) diluted 1:400 in phosphate-buffered saline. YIpGAL1-FET4 was constructed by inserting the 2.7-kilobaseKpnI-SacI fragment from pCB1 (26Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Google Scholar) into pRS304 (40Sikorski R.S. Heiter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar). This plasmid was digested with XbaI and transformed into DEY1422 to generate DEY1446 (41Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Google Scholar). Plasmid pCB2 is a derivative of pCB1 that contains a 66-base pair deletion in the FET45′-untranslated region. YIpGF4d1 was constructed by cloning theGAL1-FET4 KpnI-NotI fragment of pCB2 into pRS304. Mutations were generated in YIpGF4d1 by site-directed mutagenesis using the Transformer system (CLONTECH) and verified by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmids were linearized by digestion with XbaI and transformed into DDY4. Trp+colonies were isolated and confirmed to contain theGAL1-FET4 fusion gene by polymerase chain reaction. The Fe2+ uptake and Fe3+ reductase assays were performed at 30 °C as described previously (3Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Google Scholar) except that 55Fe was substituted for 59Fe, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Iron accumulation by wild type and mutant cells at 30 °C was found to be linear over the entire time of the uptake rate determination.55Fe accumulation due to cell surface binding was estimated by incubating parallel samples at 0 °C for the same period as the assay. These values were then subtracted from the 30 °C samples before calculation of uptake rates. The 0 °C values, which never exceeded 5% of the 30 °C samples, were similar to the level of iron accumulation observed with a fet3 fet4 mutant at 30 °C indicating that this was an appropriate method for measuring cell surface iron binding. Determinations of apparent K m and V max values were made by fitting the data directly to theoretical curves using KINETASYST software (Intellikinetics, Princeton, NJ). Based on the “positive-inside” rule (42Sipos L. Von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1333-1340Google Scholar), a model was devised describing the topology of FET4 in a lipid bilayer membrane (Fig. 1). Three hydrophilic regions of the protein were selected for use as antigens to generate antibodies against FET4. These regions were the amino-terminal 60 amino acids (anti-N), 101 amino acids located between transmembrane domains 1 and 2 (anti-L1), and 51 amino acids located between transmembrane domains 5 and 6 (anti-L5). These portions of FET4 were expressed in E. coli as fusions to the phage T7 gene 10 protein and purified. The fusion proteins were then injected into rabbits and affinity-purified antisera were prepared. On immunoblots, while the preimmune serum did not detect any proteins in total cell homogenates (Fig. 2 A,lane 1), anti-L1 antibody detected three proteins of 68 kDa (“p68”), 63 kDa (“p63”), and 46 kDa (“p46”) molecular mass (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). The predicted molecular mass of FET4 is 63 kDa. Detection of p68, p63, and p46 could be blocked by preincubation of the antibody with the gene 10-FET4 fusion protein but not by preincubation with gene 10 protein alone (Fig. 2 A,lanes 3 and 4). Thus, these three proteins are detected by antibodies that recognize the FET4 portion of the fusion protein. Further experiments demonstrated that both p63 and p68 are products of the FET4 gene, whereas p46 is encoded by another gene. First, the two other anti-FET4 antibodies, anti-N and anti-L5, detected p68 and p63 but not p46 (Fig. 2 A, lane 5and 6). Furthermore, p68 and p63 levels were altered by overexpression and deletion of the FET4 gene; p68 and p63 levels were low in wild type cells, undetectable in fet4mutant cells, and very high in cells overexpressing the FET4gene from the GAL1 promoter (Fig. 2 B). The level of p46 was unaffected by differential FET4 expression. What is the relationship between the p68 and p63 forms of FET4? Neither p68 nor p63 is N-glycosylated or phosphorylated; no change in electrophoretic mobility was observed when membrane proteins were treated with endoglycosidase H, peptide N-glycosidase F, or alkaline phosphatase (data not shown). To determine which form was the primary translation product, we synthesized FET4 in vitro(Fig. 2 C). Although no protein product was detected in a control reaction with the vector alone, a FET4 expression plasmid directed the synthesis of a FET4 protein with the same electrophoretic mobility as p68. These results suggested that p68 is the primary translation product of the FET4 gene and p63 is an altered form generated, perhaps, by proteolytic cleavage of p68. This proteolysis probably occurs in vivo because it was not prevented by the addition of protease inhibitors to the homogenization buffers nor was it prevented when proteins were prepared from a strain, BJ2168, that is defective for several vacuolar proteases (43Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-453Google Scholar). The physiological significance of this modification is unclear; the abundance of p63 relative to p68 was variable and did not correlate with the level of iron in the growth medium, the level ofFET4 expression, or the carbon source on which the cells were grown (data not shown). Cellular proteins were separated into soluble and particulate/membrane fractions, and these fractions were examined for the presence of FET4 by immunoblotting (Fig. 3 A). In either FET4overexpressing (lanes 1–3) or wild type (lanes 4–6) cells, both p63 and p68 were highly enriched in the particulate/membrane fraction. A small amount of the p63 form was also found in the soluble fraction in FET4-overexpressing cells. This may be due to the presence of p63 in small vesicles that sediment slowly during ultracentrifugation. The p46 protein was found only in the soluble protein fraction. The enrichment of FET4 in the particulate/membrane fraction suggested that this protein was associated with membranes. When this fraction was treated with high pH, NaCl, NaBr, or urea, i.e. agents that disrupt protein-protein interactions (44Thomas T.C. McNamee M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 499-520Google Scholar), FET4 remained associated with the particulate/membrane fraction (Fig. 3 B). Treatment with the detergents Triton X-100 andn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside released FET4 into the soluble fraction. These results indicate that FET4 is an integral membrane protein. Slower migrating forms of FET4 were observed in the detergent-solubilized fractions that may be dimeric FET4. Consistent with this hypothesis, the molecular mass of this complex was 130–140 kDa, i.e. twice the monomeric FET4 mass. The subcellular location of FET4 was first assessed by fractionation of cellular membranes on a 20–55% (w/w) sucrose gradient. The density of the isolated fractions increased linearly from 1.08 to 1.22 g/ml, and protein was most abundant in the lowest density fractions where soluble proteins are found (Fig. 4 A). Equal volumes of alternate fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of FET4 and several marker proteins specific to particular subcellular compartments (Fig. 4 B), and these blots were quantitated by densitometric scanning (Fig. 4 C). FET4 was most abundant in fraction 15 (d 1.22 g/ml; 55% sucrose). PMA1, the plasma membrane marker protein, was also most abundant in fraction 15 as was the product of an epitope-tagged CTR1 allele (data not shown). CTR1 is the high affinity copper transporter and has also been localized to the plasma membrane (45Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar). The presence of PMA1, CTR1, and FET4 in the bottom fraction of the gradient was not due to protein aggregation. When fraction 15 was treated withn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and reloaded onto a sucrose gradient, these proteins were found in the low density fractions (data not shown). Marker proteins specific for intracellular compartments, i.e. the vacuolar VPH1 protein, the mitochondrial OMP2 protein, and the endoplasmic reticulum HMG1 protein were most abundant in lower density fractions. In a similar experiment, a Golgi marker protein (dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase A) showed a distribution in the gradient like that of OMP2 (36Kölling R. Hollenberg C.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3261-3271Google Scholar). Thus, FET4 co-fractionated with plasma membranes in these gradients. By indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, the FET4 protein could be visualized as a bright rim of fluorescence at the periphery of cells overexpressing the FET4 gene (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained with anti-N antibody (data not shown). In contrast, a fet4 mutant strain did not show this peripheral staining. These results also indicate that FET4 is a plasma membrane protein. Attempts to detect FET4 when expressed at wild type levels were unsuccessful probably due to the protein's normally low level of synthesis (Fig. 2 B). FET4 overexpression increased low affinity uptake activity, whereas disruption of the gene eliminated that activity (26Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Google Scholar). This correlation supported the hypothesis that FET4 encodes the Fe2+ transporter of the low affinity system. To test this correlation more rigorously, we used the fusion gene in whichFET4 is expressed under the regulation of theGAL1 promoter. Cells overexpressing FET4 in galactose-containing medium were split into two cultures, and glucose was added to one culture to shut off expression of the GAL1promoter; GAL1 promoter activity is reduced to less than 10% of the induced level within 5 min of glucose addition (46Parker R. Herrick D. Peltz S.W. Jacobson A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 415-423Google Scholar). Cells were harvested periodically and assayed for Fe2+ uptake activity (Fig. 6 A) and FET4 levels (Fig.6 B). The activity of the low affinity system in untreated cells increased slightly as did the level of FET4. In glucose-treated cells, low affinity uptake decreased approximately 40-fold. FET4 levels declined to a similar degree, and its profile was almost superimposable with the loss of uptake activity. Thus, FET4 levels and uptake activity of the low affinity system closely correlated over a broad range of expression levels. To determine if the low affinity system is iron-regulated, we measured this activity in iron-replete and iron-limited cells. A fet3mutant was used for this analysis to allow measurement of low affinity activity in the absence of the high affinity system. The low affinity system is iron-regulated; uptake activity increased approximately 3-fold in iron-limited cells (Fig. 7 A). Fe3+ reductase activity was also induced approximately 3-fold in these cells, confirming that this medium was iron-limiting (Fig. 7 B). To assess if AFT1 plays a role in this regulation, we measured uptake activity in a strain bearing theAFT1-1 up allele. AFT1-1 up causes constitutively induced expression from AFT1-responsive promoters (24Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Google Scholar). Activity of the low affinity system was not increased by the AFT1-1 up allele, whereas Fe3+reductase activity was constitutively active in this strain. These results indicate that the low affinity activity is regulated in response to iron by a mechanism distinct from AFT1 transcriptional activation. The increased uptake activity in response to iron limitation was caused by a change in V max, whereas the apparentK m was unaffected (Fig. 7 C). The apparentK m and V max of iron-replete cells was 41 ± 7 μm Fe2+ and 110 ± 15 fmol/min/106 cells, respectively. In iron-limited cells, the apparent K m was 33 ± 8 μm Fe2+, and the V maxwas 372 ± 27 fmol/min/106 cells. Immunoblots demonstrated that while the level of the PMA1 plasma membrane ATPase was unaffected by iron limitation, FET4 levels increased approximately 3-fold (Fig. 7 D). The experiments described above support the hypothesis that FET4 encodes the low affinity transporter protein. The identification of mutations inFET4 that alters intrinsic kinetic properties of the low affinity system also supports this hypothesis. Especially informative are mutations that alter the affinity (i.e. apparentK m) of the system for Fe2+ because this parameter is determined by the direct interaction of the transporter with its substrate (47Stein W.D. Channels, Carriers, and Pumps. An Introduction to Membrane Transport. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 127-169Google Scholar). We anticipated that critical ligands for Fe2+ binding would be located in or near the predicted transmembrane domains. Nine potential ligands were chosen for site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1) (see “Discussion”). In each case, the amino acid was replaced with an alanine residue because such mutations have been demonstrated to minimize structural alterations in the protein (48Bennett W.F. Paoni N.F. Keyt B.A. Botstein D. Jones A.J.S. Presta L. Wurm F.M. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5191-5201Google Scholar). The mutant alleles were expressed from theGAL1 promoter in a fet3 fet4 mutant strain and assayed for Fe2+ uptake. The effects of these mutations on the concentration dependence ofFET4-mediated Fe2+ uptake were determined (Fig.8), and the apparent K m andV max values derived from these data are summarized in Table I. Two of the nine alleles, Y222A and Y408A, had little effect on the apparent K m for Fe2+. A third allele, Y392A, increased theK m approximately 2.5-fold. Three other alleles increased the apparent K m even higher. These increases ranged from 13-fold for Y352A to more than 30-fold for D271A.V max values were also altered for several of these alleles, ranging from 30 to 200% of the wild type rates. No saturability of D271A-dependent uptake was observed in assays conducted with Fe2+ concentrations as high as 3 mm (data not shown), preventing an accurate determination of the V max of this allele. Clearly, mutations in FET4 can greatly alter the kinetic properties of the low affinity system.Table IEffects of FET4 alleles on low affinity Fe2+ uptakeFET4alleleK mV maxμmfmol/min/10 6 cellswild type35 ± 54072 ± 156Y222A29 ± 43664 ± 116Y392A87 ± 202648 ± 195Y408A22 ± 71293 ± 73D271A≥1000≥4000Y276A787 ± 1378743 ± 912Y352A458 ± 932682 ± 251D354ANDD400ANDE406ANDThe apparent K m and V max values were determined from the data in Fig. 8 and are the means (± 1 S.E.) of several replicates for each strain (n ≥ 4).

Open table in a new tab The apparent K m and V max values were determined from the data in Fig. 8 and are the means (± 1 S.E.) of several replicates for each strain (n ≥ 4). ND, no uptake activity detectable. Three mutations, D354A, D400A, and E406A, completely eliminated low affinity uptake activity. While D354A and D400A produced wild type levels of FET4, no protein was detected in the E406A-expressing strain (data not shown). Subcellular fractionation of proteins from D354A and D400A on sucrose density gradients indicated that these forms were properly localized to the plasma membrane (data not shown). When overexpressed in a wild type FET4 strain, however, D354A and D400A were both found to be recessive. The experiments described in this report test the hypothesis that FET4 is the Fe2+ transporter protein of the low affinity system. Consistent with this role, FET4 is an integral membrane protein and localized to the plasma membrane. Additional supporting evidence was provided by the close correlation between FET4 levels and uptake activity. This correlation was demonstrated in studies where theFET4 gene was overexpressed under the control of theGAL1 promoter as well as when it was expressed from its own promoter. These experiments also indicated that the low affinity system is regulated by iron. The V max of the low affinity uptake increased approximately 3-fold in iron-limited cells relative to iron-replete cells, and a similar degree of induction was observed for FET4 levels. Fe3+ reductase activity was also induced by iron limitation in these cells. Despite this similarity, FET4 and the Fe3+ reductase activity are probably not regulated by the same mechanism because they respond differently to theAFT1-1 up allele. AFT1 encodes a transcriptional activator that controls the expression of several iron-responsive genes including the Fe3+ reductase genesFRE1 and FRE2. The AFT1-1 upallele causes constitutive expression of all of the genes known to be regulated by this protein (24Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Google Scholar, 25Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Google Scholar). This allele had no effect on the regulation of the low affinity system, suggesting that an additional system of iron-responsive regulation exists in S. cerevisiae. Strong evidence for the role of FET4 as an Fe2+ transporter was also obtained from characterizing mutations in the FET4gene. We hypothesized that if FET4 was the transporter, it would be possible to isolate mutant alleles of FET4 that alter the kinetic properties of the low affinity system. Of particular interest were mutations that changed the affinity (i.e. apparentK m) of the system for Fe2+ because this parameter is determined by the direct interaction of the transporter with its substrate. An examination of the amino acid sequence of FET4 did not reveal any obvious metal-binding motifs in the hydrophilic regions of the protein. Such motifs, which have been observed for other metal transporters such as CTR1 (45Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar), CCC2 (21Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar), FTR1 (23Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Scopus (580) Google Scholar), and IRT1 (28Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Google Scholar), may be involved in substrate binding during transport. The observation that FET4 lacks such sequences suggested that initial binding of Fe2+ by this protein could be mediated by ligands located within the transmembrane domains. Fe2+ is a borderline hard-soft Lewis acid, so potential ligands include oxygen-containing hard Lewis bases as well as sulfur-containing soft Lewis bases (49Lippard S.J. Berg J.M. Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Mill Valley1994: 21-23Google Scholar). Thus, each transmembrane domain contains several potential Fe2+ ligands. For this analysis, we mutagenized aspartate and glutamate residues and the “hydrophobic anion” (50Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Google Scholar) tyrosine. Aspartates and glutamates were chosen because their negative charge makes them likely candidates for interaction with a cationic substrate. Such amino acids have been implicated in substrate binding by other cation transporters. Based on an analysis similar to ours, the substrate-binding site of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase has been proposed to utilize three glutamates and an aspartate (51Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6262-6267Google Scholar, 52Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Google Scholar). Furthermore, we considered the iron-binding protein ferritin as a paradigm for how an Fe2+ transporter might bind its substrate. Ferritin is a cytoplasmic protein that assembles into a hollow, spherical complex that is capable of taking up Fe2+. This complex has an outer diameter of 130 Å and an inner diameter of 75 Å and the channels through which Fe2+ passes are lined with glutamates. These negatively charged amino acids, present in the consensus sequence RE(G/H)AE, have been implicated in the transport of iron into the protein shell of ferritin (53Trikha J. Theil E.C. Allewell N.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 949-967Google Scholar). Recently, glutamates in a similar sequence motif (REGLE) were found in a potential transmembrane domain of FTR1 and demonstrated to be critical for iron uptake by this permease (23Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Although a similar motif is not found in FET4, these observations suggested that negatively charged residues may be important for FET4 Fe2+ binding. Tyrosine residues in the potential transmembrane domains were also of interest because these residues can bind iron through interaction of the dipole moment of the electronegative oxygen in the hydroxyl group or through a cation-Π interaction involving the quadrupole moment of the aromatic ring. It was recently proposed that the relatively hydrophobic side chains of amino acids with quadrupole moments (i.e. tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan) would be well-suited to serve as cation ligands while embedded in the environment of a transmembrane domain (50Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Google Scholar). Furthermore, tyrosines have been proposed to play a role in the ion selectivity of voltage-gated K+ channels like the Shaker channel ofDrosophila (54Heginbotham L. Mackinnon R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 483-491Google Scholar). Based on these criteria, nine amino acids were chosen for mutagenesis. Measurable V max values in this collection of mutants ranged from 30 to 200% of wild type rates. Three alleles, D271A, Y276A, and Y352A, had 13- to >30-fold higher apparentK m values than the wild type. These effects strongly suggest that there is a direct interaction between FET4 and the substrate of the low affinity system. It is very possible that one or more of these residues are ligands for Fe2+ binding during transport. It seems unlikely that all three amino acids are ligands given that D271A and Y276A are predicted to be near the outer surface of the plasma membrane and Y352A is predicted to be near the inner surface of the membrane. Reconciling these data in terms of a single Fe2+ binding site will require a careful analysis of the membrane topology of FET4.

https://openalex.org/W2020121361,"All-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acid are active retinoids for regulating expression of retinoid responsive genes, serving as ligands for two classes of ligand-dependent transcription factors, the retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X receptors. Little is known, however, regarding 9-cis-retinoic acid formation. We have obtained a 1.4-kilobase cDNA clone from a normalized human breast tissue library, which when expressed in CHO cells encodes a protein that avidly catalyzes oxidation of 9-cis-retinol to 9-cis-retinaldehyde. This protein also catalyzes oxidation of 13-cis-retinol at a rate approximately 10% of that of the 9-cis isomer but does not catalyze all-trans-retinol oxidation. NAD+ was the preferred electron acceptor for oxidation of 9-cis-retinol, although NADP+ supported low rates of 9-cis-retinol oxidation. The rate of 9-cis-retinol oxidation was optimal at pHs between 7.5 and 8. Sequence analysis indicates that the cDNA encodes a protein of 319 amino acids that resembles members of the short chain alcohol dehydrogenase protein family. mRNA for the protein is most abundant in human mammary tissue followed by kidney and testis, with lower levels of expression in liver, adrenals, lung, pancreas, and skeletal muscle. We propose that this cDNA encodes a previously unknown stereospecific enzyme, 9-cis-retinol dehydrogenase, which probably plays a role in 9-cis-retinoic acid formation.

Retinoids (vitamin A and its analogs) are essential dietary substances that are needed by mammals for reproduction, normal embryogenesis, growth, vision, and maintaining normal cellular differentiation and the integrity of the immune system (1Wolbach S.B.

Within cells, retinoids regulate gene transcription acting through ligand-dependent transcription factors, the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) 1The abbreviations used are: RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptors; 9cRDH, 9-cis-retinol dehydrogenase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. 1The abbreviations used are: RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptors; 9cRDH, 9-cis-retinol dehydrogenase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary., and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (6Mangelsdorf D.J.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Google Scholar). All-trans-retinoic acid binds only to RARs with high affinity, whereas its 9-cis isomer binds with high affinity to both RARs and RXRs. The actions of all-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acid in regulating cellular responses are distinct and not interchangeable. In contrast to the great explosion of information regarding the actions of retinoid receptors in regulating gene transcription, information regrading how the abundant precursor retinol is physiologically activated to form the ligands needed to activate retinoid receptors is only slowly emerging (see Refs. 8Durster G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12221-12227Google Scholar and 9Napoli J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 993-1001Google Scholar for recent reviews). It is clear that the pathway for conversion of retinol to retinoic acid involves first the oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde and then the oxidation of retinaldehyde to retinoic acid. Numerous enzymes that are able to catalyze either retinol or retinaldehyde oxidation have been identified, purified, and/or characterized (8Durster G.

The Retinoids, Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 229-256Google Scholar). These enzymes are members of four distinct families: the alcohol dehydrogenases, the short chain alcohol dehydrogenases, the aldehyde dehydrogenases, and cytochrome P-450s (8Durster G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12221-12227Google Scholar, 9Napoli J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 993-1001Google Scholar, 10Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids, Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 229-256Google Scholar). At present, the most attention has focused on enzymes responsible for the oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinaldehyde (11Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7027-7037Google Scholar, 12Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 434-441Google Scholar, 13Chai X. Zhai Y. Popescu G. Napoli J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9526-9534Google Scholar). Several recent reports have indicated that both alcohol dehydrogenases and short chain alcohol dehydrogenases may be responsible for catalyzing all-trans-retinol oxidation (11Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7027-7037Google Scholar, 12Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 434-441Google Scholar, 13Chai X. Zhai Y. Popescu G. Napoli J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9526-9534Google Scholar), but the exact in vivo roles of each of these dehydrogenases in all-trans-retinoic acid formation remains controversial (8Durster G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12221-12227Google Scholar). 9-cis-Retinoic acid has been reported to be present in mammalian tissues and cells (16Levin A.A. Sturzenbecker L.J. Kazmer S. Bosakowski T.

Reprod. 1993; 48: 235-247Google Scholar), but it has not been convincingly established how 9-cis-retinoic acid is formed within tissues and cells. Urbach and Rando have reported that liver microsomes can nonenzymatically catalyze the isomerization of all-trans-retinoic acid to the 9-cis isomer (19Urbach J. Rando R.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 299: 459-465Google Scholar). Others have demonstrated that 9-cis-β-carotene can be converted to 9-cis-retinoic acid within rat tissues (20Hebuterne X. Wang X.-D. Johnson E.J. Krinsky N.I. Russell R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1264-1273Google Scholar). However, this latter pathway cannot be an essential one for 9-cis-retinoic acid formation because rats maintained on a β-carotene-free purified diet containing only retinol as a precursor for retinoic acid formation are normal. In this communication, we report the characterization of a cDNA clone for a novel human enzyme that we have designated 9-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (9cRDH) and that catalyzes in a stereospecific manner the oxidation of 9-cis-retinol to 9-cis-retinaldehyde, a first enzymatic step needed for 9-cis-retinoic acid formation. Because it has been established that 9-cis-retinaldehyde can be further oxidized to 9-cis-retinoic acid by abundant tissue retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (21Labrecque J. Bhat P.V. Lacroix A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 85-89Google Scholar, 22Labrecque J. Dumas F. Lacroix A. Bhat P.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 681-684Google Scholar, 23El Akawi Z. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1938-1943Google Scholar), it is possible that 9cRDH catalyzes a key oxidation step in the formation of 9-cis-retinoic acid. Using a primer homology strategy based on sequence information provided by Napoli and colleagues (11Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7027-7037Google Scholar, 12Boerman M.H.E.M.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 169: 219-222Google Scholar), we screened a mouse testis library for a retinol dehydrogenase cDNA clone. We obtained a 550-bp cDNA that we submitted for automated DNA sequence analysis (ABI Applied Biosystems, model 373A, Columbia, MD) through the Columbia University Comprehensive Cancer Center Core DNA Sequencing Facility. When this partial cDNA sequence was compared with sequences that had been deposited in GenBank™ (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD), a very high degree of sequence homology was observed with an unidentified cDNA sequence that had been partially sequenced (330 of approximately 1400 bp) and deposited with GenBank™ by the IMAGE Consortium (accession number R50456). We obtained the cDNA through Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL), and its complete nucleotide sequence was determined. The 1.4-kb cDNA was subcloned so that overlapping sequences were obtained for all regions of the cDNA and was used for all studies reported below. The 1.4-kb human cDNA was directionally cloned as aBamHI-EcoRI insert into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) where expression is driven by the strong promoter from the immediate early gene of the human cytomegalovirus. Both the expression vector containing the cDNA insert and vector alone were transfected using calcium phosphate into CHO cells according to standard procedures (24Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 7.37-7.84Google Scholar). Routinely, 20 μg of plasmid DNA (with or without the cDNA insert) was transfected into 2 × 106 CHO cells maintained on 100-mm tissue culture plates. At the time of transfection, the CHO cells were approximately 80% confluent. 27 h after transfection, the transfection medium was removed from the CHO cells, and they were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold 10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS). Washed CHO cells were scraped from the plate and collected by centrifugation at 500 × gat 4 °C for 10 min. The pelleted cells were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS two additional times and stored as a cell pellet at −20 °C for up to 2 weeks prior to assay for retinol dehydrogenase activity. All-trans-retinol was obtained as a gift from Dr. Christian Eckhoff of Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc. (Nutley, NJ), and 13-cis-retinol was purchased from Sigma. 9-cis-Retinol was synthesized by NaBH4 reduction of authentic 9-cis-retinaldehyde (Sigma) and subsequently purified by normal phase HPLC essentially as we have described for 11-cis-retinol synthesis and purification (25Blaner W.S. Das S.R. Gouras P. Flood M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 53-58Google Scholar). All-trans-, 13-cis-, and 9-cis-retinaldehydes were purchased from Sigma. Transfected CHO cell pellets were homogenized in PBS at 4 °C using 50 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. For assay of retinol dehydrogenase activity, aliquots of unfractionated CHO cell homogenate were incubated with 10 μm retinol (either as the all-trans, 13-cis, or 9-cis isomer added in ethanol) and either 2 mm NAD+ or 2 mm NADP+ in 10 mm Hepes containing 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 μg/ml phosphotidyl choline at pH 8.0 and 37 °C for prechosen time intervals. The final assay volume was 0.6 ml. Assays were routinely carried out in amber glass tubes that had been flushed with N2 to shield the retinoids from both light and O2. All subsequent extractions and procedures were carried out in a manner that minimized exposure of the retinoids to light and O2. Immediately following incubation, the assay mixture was denatured with an equal volume of absolute ethanol (0.6 ml), and the retinoids were extracted into 3 ml of HPLC grade hexane. Following one backwash of the hexane extract with 0.5 ml of deionized water, the hexane was evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of N2, and the extracted retinoids were immediately redissolved in 120 μl of hexane and analyzed by normal phase HPLC (see below). For assay of 9cRDH activity in rat tissues, 300-g male Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed in a CO2-saturated atmosphere and liver, kidney, spleen, testis, and epididymis were quickly removed and placed on ice. Immediately after dissection, each tissue was finely minced with razor blades, placed into a Dounce homogenizer containing 4 volumes of ice-cold PBS and homogenized with 50 strokes of the homogenizer. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 500 ×g for 10 min to remove debris and was maintained on ice prior to its use for 9cRDH assay. Assays of 9cRDH activity were carried out exactly as described above for CHO cell homogenates. For each assay, a blank containing substrate and homogenate was maintained on ice for 1 h and was subsequently extracted to correct for possible endogeneous 9-cis-retinaldehyde presence in the enzyme sources; however, in no homogenate was any 9-cis-retinaldehyde observed. The protein concentrations of CHO cell homogenates and of each homogenate from the rat tissues were determined using the Bradford reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stereoisomers of both retinol and retinaldehyde were separated on a 4.6 × 250-mm Vydac 101HS54 silica column using hexane:n-propanol:1-octanol (98.9:1.0:0.1 v/v) flowing at 1.5 ml/min as the mobile phase. The running column was preceded by a silica guard column. Retinols and retinaldehydes were detected by UV absorbance at 350 nm. Retention times for all-trans-, 13-cis-, and 9-cis-retinols were established using purified compounds obtained as described above. Retention times for all-trans-, 13-cis-, and 9-cis-retinaldehyde were determined using commercial standards (Sigma). Quantities of each retinol and retinaldehyde isomer present in extracts were determined by comparisons of the integrated areas under the HPLC peaks with a standard curve constructed relating integrated peak area with known masses of each retinoid isomer. The concentrations of each retinoid isomer were determined by UV-visible spectrophotometry using published extinction coefficients for each retinol and retinaldehyde isomer (26Furr H.C. Barua A.B. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids, Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 179-210Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was used to explore 9cRDH expression in human testis, kidney, lung, liver, heart, adrenals, pancreas, thyroid, skeletal muscle, placenta, mammary gland, and a mammary tumor. All tissues, with the exception of mammary gland and mammary tumor, were obtained at autopsy. The mammary gland and mammary tumor were obtained as frozen blocks embedded for diagnosis. Total RNA was isolated from each tissue sample using standard procedures (24Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 7.37-7.84Google Scholar). Total RNA samples were electorphoresed on 0.8% agarose containing 2.2m formaldehyde at 0.5 V/cm for 14 h. After electrophoresis the gel was soaked in 20 × SSC for 1 h and blotted overnight onto a nitrocellulose membrane using 10 × SSC. The total RNA transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane was baked at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 2 h. The blot was probed with a cRNA probe generated from the full-length human 9cRDH cDNA clone in pcDNA3 (as used for CHO cell expression studies). The cRNA probe was labeled using SP6 polymerase and [32P]UTP. Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C in 5 × SSC, 60% formamide, 1% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and 7% dextran sulfate. After hybridization, the final wash of the RNA-RNA blot was at 80 °C in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 1 h. We were interested in obtaining a cDNA clone for a retinol dehydrogenase from a mouse testis library for use in study of the cellular sites of retinoic acid formation within the testis. Using a primer homology strategy similar to strategies described by Napoli and colleagues (11Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7027-7037Google Scholar, 12Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 434-441Google Scholar, 13Chai X. Zhai Y. Popescu G. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28408-28412Google Scholar, 14Chai X. Napoli J.L. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 169: 219-222Google Scholar), we obtained a partial length product (550 bp) which, upon search of known sequences present in GenBank™, was found to have a very high sequence homology to a previously unidentified cDNA having a length of 1.4 kb and for which a partial sequence had been obtained as part of the Human Genome Project. Because this cDNA was much larger than the one we obtained from the screen of the mouse testis library, we obtained the cDNA for preliminary study. Our preliminary characterizations of this human cDNA suggested to us that the cDNA encoded a protein that could catalyze the reduction of NAD+ when a mixture of retinol isomers was incubated with expressed protein encoded by the cDNA; consequently, we set out to characterize more extensively this human cDNA and the protein that it encodes. Because only 330 bp of the approximately 1400 bp present in the human cDNA had been sequenced, we completed the sequencing of this cDNA. The complete nucleotide sequence for the cDNA is provided in Fig. 1 along with the deduced amino acid sequence for the protein that it encodes. Sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed the presence of a putative translation start site approximately 80 bp downstream from its 5′-end and continuing for approximately 170 bp after the occurrence of a translation stop codon. The cDNA consisted of 1239 bp and could encode a protein of 319 amino acids. A search of the GenBank™ for homologous sequences indicated that bovine retinal pigment epithelial 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase and rat liver all-trans-retinol dehydrogenases, types I, II, and III, were highly homologous to that of the 1.4-kb cDNA. For comparison, the deduced amino acid sequences for bovine 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase and rat all-trans-retinol dehydrogenases, types I and II, are also provided in Fig. 1. No other sequences present in the GenBank™ data base were similarly homologous to the sequence that we obtained. Computer analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence indicated that the protein contained no membrane spanning domains. Furthermore, computer analysis of the amino acid sequences indicated that the protein encoded by the cDNA clone is most probably a member of the family of short chain alcohol dehydrogenases, like the bovine 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (27Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1107-1112Google Scholar, 28Driessen C.A. Janssen B.P. Winkens H.J. van Bugt A.H. de Leeuw T.L. Janssen J.J. Invest.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7027-7037Google Scholar, 12Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 434-441Google Scholar, 13Chai X. Zhai Y. Popescu G. Napoli J.L. J. Biol.

Based on these sequence homologies and the results from our preliminary studies, it seemed likely to us that we had obtained a human cDNA clone for a retinol dehydrogenase. However, based on our preliminary studies, it was not fully clear whether this cDNA was a human homolog of one of the rat liver all-trans-retinol dehydogenases (11Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7027-7037Google Scholar, 12Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 434-441Google Scholar, 13Chai X. Zhai Y. Popescu G. Napoli J.L. J. Biol.

Because 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase is expressed only in the retinal pigment epithelium (27Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1107-1112Google Scholar,28Driessen C.A. Janssen B.P. Winkens H.J. van Bugt A.H. de Leeuw T.L. Janssen J.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1995; 36: 1988-1996Google Scholar) and 11-cis-retinol is found only in the eye (4Saari J.C. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids, Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 351-386Google Scholar), we could not have cloned the human homolog for this enzyme. To determine the substrate specificity of the enzyme encoded by our cDNA, we expressed the cDNA in CHO cells and incubated homogenate from these CHO cells with all-trans-, 9-cis-, or 13-cis-retinol. As is seen in Fig. 2, in the presence of 2 mm NAD+, homogenate from the transfected CHO cells avidly oxidized 9-cis-retinol to 9-cis-retinaldehyde but was unable to catalyze the oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinaldehyde. The CHO cell homogenate catalyzed the oxidation of 13-cis-retinol to its corresponding aldehyde, but at a rate that was only 10% of that observed for the oxidation of 9-cis-retinol. Over 60% of the 9-cis-retinol added (at an in assay concentration of 10 μm) could be oxidized to 9-cis-retinaldehyde by the CHO cell homogenate. Oxidation of 9-cis-retinol was both protein- and time-dependent, and NADP+ was a poor co-factor for the reaction (8% of the activity of NAD+ when both are provided at concentrations of 2 mm). The CHO cell homogenates were unable to catalyze any detectable oxidation of all-trans-retinol, regardless of whether this retinoid was added to the CHO homogenate in organic solvents, bound to rat testis cellular retinol-binding protein, type I, bound to albumin, or in detergent emulsions. We conclude from these experiments that the 1.4-kb cDNA encodes a stereospecific 9-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (9cRDH) that has not been previously identified. Further characterization of 9cRDH activity expressed in CHO cells indicated that the enzyme has a pH optimum in the range of 7.5–8.0 and that 9cRDH activity is not inhibited by ethanol or zinc chelaters like EDTA or o-phenanthroline, unlike cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenases that can oxidize retinol to retinaldehyde (15Ang H.L. Deltour L. Hayzmizu T.F. Zgombic-Knight M. Durster G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9526-9534Google Scholar, 29Boleda M.D. Saubi N. Farrés J. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 85-90Google Scholar). Neither exposure to high NaCl concentrations (up to 1 m) nor exposure to reducing reagents (1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm dithiothreitol) influenced 9cRDH activity. CHO cell expressed 9cRDH activity, however, is sensitive to detergents and is rapidly inactivated by exposure to 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 or to 1% (w/v) sodium cholate. In addition, the 9cRDH activity present in CHO cell homogenates is rapidly lost upon storage at −20 °C, although the activity does not appear to be lost when CHO cells are frozen intact. The distribution of 9cRDH expression in human tissues was assessed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3). The transcript identified by Northern blot analysis is approximately 1.5 kb, a size that agrees well with that predicted by the full-length human 9cRDH cDNA clone. 9cRDH mRNA is most abundant in normal mammary tissue and is relatively abundant in kidney and the testis. Liver, heart, and adrenals each express 9cRDH mRNA at nearly equal levels, but these are lower than those of mammary tissue, kidney and testis. 9cRDH mRNA is present at low levels in lung, pancreas, and skeletal muscle. Interestingly, 9cRDH is only very weakly expressed in total RNA prepared from a human mammary tumor. We also asked whether 9cRDH activity could be detected in whole tissue homogenates prepared from rat liver, spleen, kidney, epididymis, and testis. As shown in TableI, 9cRDH specific activity was highest in the kidney followed by the testis, epididymis, liver, and spleen.Table ISpecific activity levels of 9-cis-Retinol dehydrogenase in selected rat tissue homogenatesTissue9-cis-Retinaldehyde formednmol/h/mg proteinLiver2.4 ± 0.41-aValues are expressed as the means ± 1 S.D. for activity determinations for homogenates prepared from tissues from three animals.Kidney4.9 ± 0.1Spleen1.6 ± 0.3Testis3.6 ± 0.5Epididymis2.8 ± 1.0a Values are expressed as the means ± 1 S.D. for activity determinations for homogenates prepared from tissues from three animals. Open table in a new tab It is generally accepted that 9-cis-retinoic acid is a physiologically important molecule for mediating retinoid actions in regulating gene expression, but only limited information has been available regarding how 9-cis-retinoic acid or any 9-cis-retinoid is formed within tissues and cells. This is unlike the visual process where it is now well established that isomerization of all-trans-retinoids to 11-cis-retinoids is catalyzed by a specific enzyme and that the isomerization takes place at the level of the retinols and not the retinaldehydes (4Saari J.C. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids, Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 351-386Google Scholar). Because of the first reports in 1992 that 9-cis-retinoic acid is a ligand for the RXRs, several studies have explored possible pathways for 9-cis-retinoic acid formation. Urbach and Rando have reported that membranes prepared from bovine liver will catalyze nonenzymatically the isomerization of all-trans-retinoic acid to 9-cis-retinoic acid (19Urbach J. Rando R.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 299: 459-465Google Scholar). This isomerization was shown to depend on free sulfhydryl groups present in the microsomes and not to involve the participation of an enzyme (19Urbach J. Rando R.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 299: 459-465Google Scholar). Krinsky, Russell, and colleagues have reported that 9-cis-β-carotene serves as a precursor for 9-cis-retinoic acid in vivo in the rat (20Hebuterne X. Wang X.-D. Johnson E.J. Krinsky N.I. Russell R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1264-1273Google Scholar). However, because rats maintained on carotenoid-free diets display normal health, the conversion of 9-cis-β-carotene to 9-cis-retinoic acid cannot be an essential pathway for formation of this retinoic acid isomer. In studies of retinaldehyde dehydrogenases purified from rat kidney (21Labrecque J. Bhat P.V. Lacroix A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 85-89Google Scholar, 22Labrecque J. Dumas F. Lacroix A. Bhat P.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 681-684Google Scholar) and rat liver (23El Akawi Z. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1938-1943Google Scholar), the ability of these enzymes to catalyze the oxidation of 9-cis-retinaldehyde to 9-cis-retinoic acid was taken to suggest that a pathway starting with 9-cis-retinol may be important for 9-cis-retinoic acid formation (21Labrecque J. Bhat P.V. Lacroix A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 85-89Google Scholar, 22Labrecque J. Dumas F. Lacroix A. Bhat P.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 681-684Google Scholar). To further substantiate this possibility, Bhat, Lacroix, and colleagues demonstrated the presence of 9-cis-retinol in rat kidney at levels that were approximately 10% of that of all-trans-retinol (22Labrecque J. Dumas F. Lacroix A. Bhat P.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 681-684Google Scholar). Our work characterizing a stereospecific 9cRDH activity and demonstration of the broad tissue distribution of this enzyme adds additional support to the hypothesis that 9-cis-retinoic acid is formed within tissues via a pathway that involves both 9-cis-retinol and 9-cis-retinaldehyde. A search of the GenBank™ for DNA sequences homologous to that of 9cRDH revealed that the sequence of the 9cRDH cDNA is approximately 87% homologous to that of the full-length cDNA for bovine retinal pigment epithelium 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (27Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1107-1112Google Scholar) and approximately 48% homologous to the coding region of the cDNA sequence for rat liver all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase, type II (13Chai X. Zhai Y. Popescu G. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28408-28412Google Scholar). At the amino acid level, the deduced amino acid sequence for 9cRDH is 89% identical to that of bovine 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (27Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1107-1112Google Scholar) and 53% identical to that of rat liver all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase, type II (13Chai X. Zhai Y. Popescu G. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28408-28412Google Scholar). Like the bovine 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase and the rat liver all-trans-retinol dehydrogenases, types I, II, and III, 9cRDH is a member of the family of short chain alcohol dehydrogenases. Moreover, 9cRDH shares many properties including pH optimum, insensitivity to inhibition by ethanol, and sensitivity to detergent inactivation with the other members of this protein family. Most importantly though, like these other short chain alcohol dehydrogenases, 9cRDH shows a marked stereospecificity for retinol substrates. Based on work showing that a retinaldehyde dehydrogenase purified from rat kidney can catalyze the oxidation of both all-trans- and 9-cis-retinaldehyde and that 9-cis-retinol is present in relatively high levels in the rat kidney (21Labrecque J. Bhat P.V. Lacroix A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 85-89Google Scholar, 22Labrecque J. Dumas F. Lacroix A. Bhat P.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 681-684Google Scholar), it has been hypothesized that 9-cis-retinoic acid is formed in the kidney through a two-step oxidation starting with 9-cis-retinol. Our demonstration of 9cRDH in the kidney provides strong support for this hypothesis. Moreover, identification of this short chain alcohol dehydrogenase, 9cRDH, raises many additional interesting questions regarding the biochemical processes that are important for providing 9-cis-retinoids to tissue and cell. One such question concerns how 9-cis-retinoids are formed. Whether or not isomerization of all-trans-retinoic acid actually occurs nonenzymatically in living cells has not been addressed experimentally, although it is clear that some cell types do have the capacity to isomerize all-trans-retinoic acid to the 9-cis isomer (30Takatsuka J. Takahashi N. De Luca L.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 58: 675-678Google Scholar). Another important question regarding 9-cis-retinoid formation concerns whether there are other short chain alcohol dehydrogenases present in tissues and cells distinct from 9cRDH that catalyze 9-cis-retinol oxidation. There are at least three short chain alcohol dehydrogenases that catalyze all-trans-retinol oxidation (11Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7027-7037Google Scholar, 12Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 434-441Google Scholar, 13Chai X. Zhai Y. Popescu G. Napoli J.L. J. Biol.

Perhaps most importantly, though, it is essential that we gain understanding of the specific physiologic role or roles played by each of these short chain alcohol dehydrogenases and by each of the alcohol dehydrogenases that catalyze oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde. Are these enzymes redundant or do they all play significant roles in retinoic acid formation but in specific and defined cellular and metabolic contexts? Although it is clear that many enzymes are able to catalyze retinol oxidation, convincing physiologic functions for these enzymes within living organisms remain elusive. We thank Mary V. Gamble for help in preparing this work and for assistance in carrying out transfections."

Here we provide evidence for a new mechanism for growth factor-stimulated receptor dimer formation, designated secondary dimerization. The growth factor-induced dimerization and ensuing receptor trans-autophosphorylation results in the dissociation of the original (primary) receptor dimer. Each phosphorylated receptor monomer then interacts with a new (nonphosphorylated) receptor to form a secondary dimer. Treatment of cells with EGF yields Neu-ErbB3 secondary dimers, and heregulin treatment induces the formation of Neu-EGF receptor (secondary) dimers.

The interactions of various growth factors and cytokines with cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases initiate a variety of intracellular signaling pathways that when integrated yield cell cycle progression, cell differentiation, or apoptosis. Several classes of receptor tyrosine kinases have been described, among which the EGFR family is of particular interest, because these receptors have been implicated in malignant transformation (1Alimandi M.

Two of the receptors, EGFR and ErbB4, are capable of ligand-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity. Thus far, the Neu tyrosine kinase is an orphan receptor, whereas ErbB3 appears to be a kinase-defective receptor (14Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Google Scholar, 16Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkovitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Rats Rtzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Google Scholar).The binding of EGF or HRG to their receptors results in receptor dimerization and receptor trans-autophosphorylation. The phosphorylated receptors recruit cellular signaling proteins, through the binding of their Src homology 2 or phosphotyrosine binding domains and thus initiate signaling pathways (17Carpenter G.

The binding of EGF stimulates the formation of both EGFR homodimers or heterodimers like EGFR-Neu (19Yarden Y. Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1443-1451Google Scholar, 20King C.R. Borrello I.

Similarly, HRG can stimulate receptor homodimer formation of ErbB3 or of ErbB4 as well as receptor heterodimers like ErbB3 and Neu or ErbB4 and Neu (13Carraway III, K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.

Rothwell V.M. Buckley S. Nature. 1994; 366: 473-475Google Scholar). The HRG-promoted formation of these heterodimers provides the molecular basis for the stimulation of Neu tyrosine kinase activity (7Wallasch C. Weiss F.U. Niederfellner G. Jallal B. Issing W.

For example, the co-expression of ErbB3 and Neu in NIH3T3 cells results in neoplastic transformation, whereas neither the expression of ErbB3 nor Neu alone is sufficient for transformation (1Alimandi M.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4267-4275Google Scholar). The heterodimerization of the EGFR with Neu results in cell transformation, whereas the replacement of wild type Neu by its kinase-defective counterpart abrogates transformation (2Earp H.S.

Moreover, the expression of Neu in breast and ovarian carcinomas correlates with a poor prognosis (1Alimandi M. Romano A. Curia M.C. Muraro R. Fedi P. Aaronson S.A. Di F.P. Kraus M.H.

The molecular basis for this is likely due to an enhanced tendency of the orphan Neu receptor to form heterodimers with other members of the EGFR family (16Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H.

Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Google Scholar), on receptor dimerization and tyrosine kinase activity in PC12 cells. In these experiments, cells were exposed to EGF or HRG and then subjected to lysis and immunoprecipitation by anti-EGFR or anti-Neu antibodies. The tyrosine kinase activity in the immunoprecipitates was inhibited by the tyrphostin AG556, a specific inhibitor of EGFR, and by AG879, which specifically inhibits Neu in various cells (27Osherov N.

Ribon V. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Saltiel A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4650-4658Google Scholar).The results of these studies suggested that both the EGFR and Neu tyrosine kinase activities were present in anti-EGFR immunoprecipitates (Table I) and were consistent with previous findings in other cell types (16Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkovitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Rats Rtzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Google Scholar, 21Goldman R. Levy R.B. Peles E. Yarden Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11024-11028Google Scholar), as well as studies in PC12 cells,2 which indicated that EGF treatment induced the formation of EGFR-Neu heterodimers. This was further reinforced by the data shown in Table I, where the tyrosine kinase activity measured in anti-Neu immunoprecipitates was sensitive to both the EGFR and Neu antagonists. However, unlike the results obtained with EGFR and Neu immunoprecipitates from EGF-stimulated PC12 cells, the data obtained from HRG-stimulated cells were unexpected. In particular, immunoprecipitation of Neu from HRG-treated PC12 cells yielded tyrosine kinase activity that was not only sensitive to the Neu kinase inhibitor (AG879) but also to the EGFR kinase inhibitor (AG556) (Table I). This finding indicates the possibility that EGFR is present in anti-Neu immunoprecipitate, although HRG does not serve as a ligand for EGFR. Likewise, anti-EGFR immunoprecipitates from HRG-treated PC12 cells showed some sensitivity to the Neu kinase inhibitor (AG879) in addition to the EGFR kinase inhibitor (AG556) (Table I), indicating the presence of Neu in the immunoprecipitate.Table IEffect of tyrphostins on tyrosine kinase activityLigandIPaImmunoprecipitation.TyrphostinTKbRelative activity of tyrosine kinase, as compared with untreated cells.EGFAnti-EGFRAG8790.50 ± 0.22AG5560.39 ± 0.15EGFAnti-NeuAG8790.56 ± 0.15AG5560.53 ± 0.19HRGAnti-NeuAG8790.52 ± 0.16AG5560.30 ± 0.02HRGAnti-EGFRAG8790.89 ± 0.04AG5560.57 ± 0.23PC12 cells were treated with a ligand and lysed, and receptors were immunoprecipitated.

Open table in a new tab Thus, one possible explanation for the results obtained with the anti-Neu immunoprecipitates (e.g. Table I) was that HRG stimulated the formation of an ErbB4-Neu primary heterodimer, in which the tyrosine kinase activity of ErbB4 would be sensitive to AG556. Thus far, however, we have not been able to reliably detect the formation of a HRG-stimulated ErbB4-Neu heterodimer in PC12 cells through Western blot analysis, using specific anti-ErbB4 antibodies. An additional possibility, which would not be mutually exclusive with the first, was that HRG stimulated the formation of a Neu-EGFR heterodimer complex. In fact, as shown in Fig. 1 (also, see Fig.2, below), anti-Neu immunoprecipitates from HRG-treated PC12 cells contain EGFR, as well as Neu and ErbB3.Figure 2HRG induces the association of Neu with EGFR. A, PC12 cells in culture were starved for 1 day in serum-free growth medium, detached, and suspended in serum-free medium. Some cell samples were preincubated for 2 min with tyrphostin AG1478 (0.5 μm) or AG879 (25 μm). Then the cells were stimulated for 2 min with HRG (20 nm) and lysed, and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-Neu antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with anti-EGFR antibodies, followed by secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. The bands were detected by chemiluminescence. B, cell stimulation by HRG results in the formation of the primary heterodimer ErbB3-Neu, followed by trans-phosphorylation, dimer dissociation, and interaction of the phospho-activated Neu with EGFR to form the secondary heterodimer Neu-EGFR. The tyrphostin AG879 inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of Neu and thus arrests the dissociation of the primary dimer Neu-ErbB3 and the formation of the secondary dimer Neu-EGFR. The tyrphostin AG1478 inhibits EGFR tyrosine kinase activity and thus arrests the dissociation of the secondary dimer Neu-EGFR.E1, EGFR; B2, Neu; B3, ErbB3.Light gray and dark gray symbols represent low and high phosphorylation levels, respectively. C, the immunoblot (IB) described in A was subjected to a second blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because neither the EGFR nor Neu directly binds HRG, these findings suggest that the EGFR-Neu complex is a secondary outcome of a primary heterodimerization event stimulated by HRG. We suggest that the trans-phosphorylation in the HRG-stimulated ErbB3-Neu dimer might be followed by dimer dissociation and interaction between activated Neu and a latent EGFR. This suggestion is in concert with our previous study, in which we have shown that HRG stimulates the heterodimerization between ErbB3 and Neu in PC12 cells but that following the trans-phosphorylation of ErbB3, it dissociated from Neu and formed a complex with the 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85) of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (26Gamett D.C. Greene T. Wagreich A. Kim H.H. Koland J.G. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19022-19027Google Scholar). Taken together, these results led us to hypothesize that the HRG-stimulated ErbB3-Neu (primary) heterodimer was not stable under conditions of trans-phosphorylation, such that the phosphorylation of the individual receptor (within the primary heterodimer) causes dimer dissociation, thus making the resulting monomers available to interact with other signaling partners. In some cases, the phosphorylated monomeric receptors may bind to Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins like p85. In other cases, however, the phosphorylated monomers can apparently interact with other (nonphosphorylated) receptor monomers to form secondary dimers.If this hypothesis were correct, we would predict that treatment with different tyrphostins, specific inhibitors of tyrosine kinase activity (31Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Google Scholar), should have specific effects on the formation of secondary receptor dimers. The data presented in Fig. 2 A (lanes 3 and 4) show that this in fact was the case. The treatment of PC12 cells with AG1478, which is a potent and specific antagonist for EGFR in various cells (31, 33, also see Table II), increased the formation of the HRG-stimulated Neu-EGFR secondary dimer, whereas, treatment with AG879, the Neu tyrosine kinase antagonist (31Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Google Scholar,33Osherov N. Levitzki A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1047-1053Google Scholar, 34Ohmichi M. Pang L. Ribon V. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Saltiel A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4650-4658Google Scholar), strongly inhibited the formation of the Neu-EGFR secondary dimer. These findings are fully consistent with the model shown in Fig.2 B. Namely, the tyrphostin AG879, by inhibiting Neu tyrosine kinase activity, prevents both the autophosphorylation of Neu and the trans-phosphorylation of ErbB3 and thus prevents the dissociation of the primary Neu-ErbB3 dimer. This, then, inhibits the formation of secondary Neu-EGFR heterodimers. However, tyrphostin AG1478, by inhibiting the EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, prevents the trans-phosphorylation of Neu within the secondary Neu-EGFR dimer, hence inhibiting the dissociation of this dimer, and increases its amount.Fig. 2 C shows the results of a Western blot of Neu immunoprecipitates using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Lanes 1 and 2 show that HRG treatment of PC12 cells stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors present in the anti-Neu immunoprecipitate. This phosphorylation was strongly inhibited by AG1478 (Fig. 2 C, lane 3), which argues that the majority of the phosphorylation occurred (in an EGFR-catalyzed manner) within the secondary Neu-EGFR dimer. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Neu was only weakly inhibited by AG879 (Fig.2 C, lane 4), which suggests that Neu autophosphorylation represented only a small percentage of the total tyrosine phosphorylation of Neu.The data shown in Fig. 3 provide evidence for the formation of another type of secondary dimer. In this case, the stimulation of PC12 cells with EGF led to the formation of a dimer between Neu and ErbB3. Again, because neither of these receptors bind EGF, this dimerization event must be the secondary outcome of a primary EGF-stimulated dimerization between the EGFR and Neu. The formation of this secondary receptor dimer was strongly inhibited by the EGFR antagonist, AG1478, and moderately inhibited by the Neu antagonist, AG879 (Fig. 3 A). These results are consistent with the model depicted in Fig. 3 B. The marked inhibition of (secondary) Neu-ErbB3 dimer formation by AG1478 suggests that the EGFR-catalyzed trans-phosphorylation of Neu is essential for the dissociation of Neu from the EGFR (within the primary dimer). The modest inhibition of (secondary) Neu-ErbB3 dimer formation by AG879 argues that Neu autophosphorylation and EGFR trans-phosphorylation (by Neu) are less critical for the dissociation of the primary EGFR-Neu dimer. The data presented in Fig. 3 C are consistent with the notion that Neu is strongly (trans) phosphorylated by the EGFR within the primary EGFR-Neu heterodimer, as evidenced by almost complete elimination of tyrosine phosphorylation by AG1478. Neu autophosphorylation, however, apparently occurs to a lesser extent, because AG879 shows a modest effect. Studies performed with A431 membranes containing EGFR, and insect cell-expressed Neu have also shown that although the EGFR can strongly trans-phosphorylate Neu, there is little or no Neu-catalyzed trans-phosphorylation of the EGFR. 3P.

The HRG stimulation would lead to the formation of an ErbB3-Neu (primary) heterodimer, and as previously reported, this yields a doublet in the ErbB3 Western blots that reflected different tyrosine phosphorylation states of ErbB3 (26Gamett D.C. Greene T. Wagreich A. Kim H.H. Koland J.G. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19022-19027Google Scholar). The lower mobility (upper band) is exclusively found with p85 (26Gamett D.C. Greene T. Wagreich A. Kim H.H. Koland J.G. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19022-19027Google Scholar), leading to the suggestion that this represents a phosphorylated form of ErbB3 that ultimately dissociates from Neu and forms a complex with p85. EGF induces the formation of a Neu-ErbB3 secondary dimer. In this case, the ErbB3 Western blot shows only a single band with a mobility essentially identical to the faster mobility ErbB3 band obtained in HRG-treated cells. Thus, these results demonstrate that the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 within Neu-ErbB3 heterodimers differs depending on whether it is a primary Neu-ErbB3 heterodimer or a secondary heterodimer, and presumably these differences will have important consequences regarding the specific substrates that are recruited to ErbB3.There currently is little debate regarding the fundamental importance of growth factor-stimulated receptor dimer formation in the actions of members of the EGFR family or in the activities of a variety of other receptor tyrosine kinases. Recent studies have shown that receptor activation and dimerization are dependent on the ligand type (24Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6071-6076Google Scholar) and that receptor dimerization is not a random process but is subjected to a certain hierarchy (16Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkovitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Rats Rtzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Google Scholar, 24Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6071-6076Google Scholar). The data presented in this study now provide evidence that growth factors can actually stimulate a cascade of receptor dimerization events through a mechanism that reflects the enzyme-substrate nature of the interactions between members of the EGFR family. We propose that growth factor-stimulated receptor dimerization represents a transient rather than a stable interaction. The trans-phosphorylation of one receptor (i.e. the substrate) by its partner receptor (the enzyme) results in the dissociation of the receptor dimer (similar to the dissociation of an enzyme-product complex). This enables the individual, trans-phosphorylated receptor(s) to form new receptor dimers and to phosphorylate new partners. TableIII shows that a variety of different primary and secondary receptor dimer combinations are possible, depending on the activating ligand used and the immunoprecipitating antibody. In the present work, we show that treatment of PC12 cells with HRG leads not only to the formation of an ErbB3-Neu primary receptor dimer but also to a Neu-EGFR secondary dimer and that treatment with EGF induces both a primary EGFR-Neu heterodimer and a secondary Neu-ErbB3 heterodimer.Table IIISelection of primary and secondary dimers by specific ligands and selective immunoprecipitationLigandIPaImmunoprecipitation.Primary dimersSecondary dimersHRGAnti-NeuNeu-ErbB3EGFR-NeuNeu-ErbB4Neu-NeuHRGAnti-EGFREGFR-ErbB3EGFR-EGFREGFR-ErbB4EGFR-NeuEGFAnti-NeuEGFR-NeuNeu-NeuNeu-ErbB3Neu-ErbB4EGFAnti-EGFREGFR-EGFREGFR-NeuEGFR-ErbB3EGFR-ErbB4Underlined receptors are present only in secondary dimers under the selective conditions used.a Immunoprecipitation. Open table in a new tab The idea that primary receptor dimerization can give rise to secondary dimerization events is supported by various other lines of study. As alluded to above, data obtained from HRG-treated PC12 cells were consistent with the idea that the primary (HRG-stimulated) receptor dimer formed between ErbB3 and Neu was of a transient nature and upon dissociation leads to ErbB3-p85 interactions (26Gamett D.C. Greene T. Wagreich A. Kim H.H. Koland J.G. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19022-19027Google Scholar). A study of the reversible dimerization of the EGFR has shown that phosphorylated monomers appeared after receptor dimerization (19Yarden Y. Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1443-1451Google Scholar). This delayed appearance of phosphorylated EGFR monomers (as compared with the formation of phosphorylated dimers) could be attributed to the dissociation of the EGFR homodimer. Recent studies have also yielded data consistent with the idea that different members of the EGFR family can become phosphorylated and activated in a ligand-independent manner,i.e. in a manner somewhat analogous to the ligand-independent formation of secondary dimerization events between a phosphorylated/activated receptor monomer and a nonphosphorylated/inactive receptor monomer. Specifically, it has recently been shown that both the EGFR and Neu can be phosphorylat"
https://openalex.org/W2106405240,"Raf-1 is a major downstream effector of mammalian Ras. Binding of the effector domain of Ras to the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 is essential for Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation. However, Rap1A, which has an identical effector domain to that of Ras, cannot activate Raf-1 and even antagonizes several Ras functionsin vivo. Recently, we identified the cysteine-rich region (CRR) of Raf-1 as another Ras-binding domain. Ha-Ras proteins carrying mutations N26G and V45E, which failed to bind to CRR, also failed to activate Raf-1. Since these mutations replace Ras residues with those of Rap1A, we examined if Rap1A lacks the ability to bind to CRR. Contrary to the expectation, Rap1A exhibited a greatly enhanced binding to CRR compared with Ha-Ras. Enhanced CRR binding was also found with Ha-Ras carrying another Rap1A-type mutation E31K. Both Rap1A and Ha-Ras(E31K) mutant failed to activate Raf-1 and interfered with Ha-Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1 in Sf9 cells. Enhanced binding of Rap1A to CRR led to co-association of Rap1A and Ha-Ras with Raf-1 N-terminal region through binding to CRR and Ras-binding domain, respectively. These results suggest that Rap1A interferes with Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation by inhibiting binding of Ras to Raf-1 CRR. Raf-1 is a major downstream effector of mammalian Ras.

These results suggest that Rap1A interferes with Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation by inhibiting binding of Ras to Raf-1 CRR. Ras belongs to a family of small GTP-binding proteins playing essential roles in cell proliferation and differentiation. Mammalianras genes carrying activating mutations are found in many types of neoplastic tissue and are able to induce morphological transformation in vitro when transfected into fibroblast cell lines. However, the rap1A gene (1Pizon V. Chardin P. Lerosey I. Olofsson B. Tavitian A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 201-204Google Scholar), encoding a 21-kDa GTP-binding protein with high homology to Ras, has been shown to to induce reversion of the transformed phenotype in Ki-ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells (2Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Google Scholar). In addition to the overall structural homology, Rap1A shares two important structural features with Ras. One is that Rap1A has an identical effector domain (amino acids 32–40) to that of Ras. The effector domain of Ras is essential for the association with and activation of its effectors (3Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Google Scholar). The other is that Rap1A undergoes similar post-translational modification to Ras at its C terminus except that Ras is farnesylated and Rap1A is geranylgeranylated (4Buss J.E. Quilliam L.A. Kato K. Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Wong G. Clark R. McCormick F. Bokoch G.M. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1523-1530Google Scholar). This modification is essential for the function of Rap1A as observed for Ras (5Kitayama H. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4284-4288Google Scholar, 6Sakoda T. Kaibuchi K. Kishi K. Kishida S. Doi K. Hoshino M. Hattori S. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1705-1711Google Scholar). Raf-1, a serine/threonine kinase regulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, is a major mammalian Ras effector and is thought to play a key role in Ras-induced cellular transformation (7Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.-W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism of Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation remains unclear, it is known that the effector domain of Ras interacts with the N-terminal RBD 1The abbreviations used are: RBD, Ras-binding domain; CRR, cysteine-rich region; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); GST, glutathione S-transferase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; KNERK, a kinase negative mutant of ERK2; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (amino acids 51–131) of Raf-1 and that this interaction is essential for physical association between these proteins as well as for the activation of Raf-1 (7Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.-W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Google Scholar). Rap1A, too, has been shown to associate with Raf-1 N-terminal fragment in vivo (8Zhang X.-F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Google Scholar), and a recent x-ray diffraction study of the crystal of the complex between Rap1A and Raf-1 RBD has provided evidence for this association at the atomic level (9Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Google Scholar). These studies suggest the possibility that the suppression of Ras function by Rap1A is due to the competitive inhibition of Ras-RBD interaction (10Burgering B.M.T. Boss J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 18-22Google Scholar), although it is unclear why Rap1A cannot activate Raf-1. We have recently identified Raf-1 CRR (amino acids 152–184) as another Ras-binding domain and demonstrated that interaction of Ras with both RBD and CRR is necessary for the activation of Raf-1 (11Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Google Scholar). Two mutations, N26G and V45E, were found to abolish the interaction of Ha-Ras with CRR and attenuate the activation of Raf-1 by Ha-Ras. The fact that both of these mutations replaced Ha-Ras residues with corresponding Rap1A residues prompted us to examine the possibility that the inability of Rap1A to activate Raf-1 is due to its failure to interact with Raf-1 CRR. Contrary to the expectation, we found that Rap1A exhibited a greatly enhanced ability to bind to CRR. Rap1A cDNA was amplified from a human lung fibroblast cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction (12Saiki R.K. Scharf S. Faloona F. Mullis K.B. Horn G.T. Erlich H.A. Arnheim N. Science. 1985; 230: 1350-1354Google Scholar) using a pair of primers, 5′-CGGGATCCGATATGCGTGAGTACAAGCTAG-3′ and 5′-AACTGCAGCAGCTAGAGCAGCAGACATGATTTC-3′. After cleavage withBamHI and PstI in the primer sequences, it was cloned into matching cleavage sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBac III (Invitrogen Inc., San Diego, CA). The cDNA for an activated Rap1A, Rap1AV12, was prepared by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (13Kramer W. Fritz H.-J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 350-367Google Scholar) and cloned into pBlueBac III as for the wild-type cDNA. pV-IKS, another baculovirus transfer vector for expressing proteins as GST fusions, was provided by Dr. D. Midra (University of California, San Francisco, CA) through Dr. A. Kikuchi (Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan) (14Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20054-20059Google Scholar). For expression of Ha-Ras fused to GST, Ha-Ras cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a pair of primers, 5′-CGCGTCTAGAATGACGGAATATAAGCTGGTG-3′ and 5′-GCCGGAATTCTCAGGAGAGCACACACTTG-3′. After digestion withXbaI and EcoRI in the primer sequences, it was cloned into matching cleavage sites of pV-IKS. Structures of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Preparation of recombinant baculoviruses expressing Ha-Ras, Rap1A, and their mutants and the purification of the post-translationally modified proteins from infected Sf9 cells were carried out as described (15Minato T.

MBP fusion proteins of Raf-1 N-terminal fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli and immobilized on amylose resin as described (11Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Google Scholar). Binding reaction was carried out by incubating 20 μl of the resin carrying various amounts of MBP-Raf-1 proteins with various amounts of GTPγS- or GDP-bound Ha-Ras or Rap1A in a total volume of 100 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1% Lubrol PX) as described (11Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Google Scholar). After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the resin was washed, and the bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 10 mm maltose and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western immunoblot detection with anti-Ras monoclonal antibody Y13-259 (Oncogene Science Inc., Manhasset, NY) or anti-Rap1A polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, California). Both anti-Ha-Ras and anti-Rap1A antibodies exhibited little cross-reactivity to Rap1A and Ha-Ras, respectively (data not shown). The assay for competitive inhibition of Ras binding to the MBP-Raf-1 fusion proteins by Rap1A were carried out by including a fixed amount of Ha-Ras and various amounts of Rap1A in the same binding reaction. For the in vitro co-association of Rap1A with GST-Ha-Ras, GST-Ha-Ras in Sf9 cell lysate was first immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose and then loaded with GTPγS. The resin was then incubated with GTPγS-bound Rap1A in the absence or the presence of purified MBP-Raf-1(51–131) or MBP-Raf-1(48–206). The binding condition was the same as described above except that the bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione in buffer A. Monolayers of Sf9 cells (2 × 107 cells) were triply infected with the recombinant baculoviruses expressing the full-length Raf-1 and Ha-RasV12, along with that expressing Ha-RasV12(E31K) or Rap1AV12 (1 × 108 plaque-forming units each). After 72 h post-infection, the cells were lysed by sonication in 1 ml of buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium vanadate) and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min. Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant (200 μl) with the anti-Raf-1 antibody C12 (2 μl) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and protein A-agarose. The Raf-1 activity was determined by incubating the immunoprecipitates in the presence of GST-MEK (13 μg) and GST-KNERK2 (1 μg) in 30 μl of kinase reaction mixture (20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (4,000 cpm/pmol)) for 30 min at 25 °C. After the incubation, proteins in the reaction mixture were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography to detect phosphorylation of GST-KNERK2 as described (11Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Google Scholar, 14Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20054-20059Google Scholar). In the previous study, we have shown that Ha-Ras binds to immobilized MBP-Raf-1(132–206), representing CRR, demonstrating that Raf-1 CRR acts as another Ras-binding domain independently of RBD (11Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Google Scholar). This binding was GTP-independent in contrast to the GTP-dependent binding to MBP-Raf-1(50–131), representing RBD. Ha-Ras mutations N26G and V45E abolished binding to CRR without affecting binding to RBD. The fact that these two mutations replaced Ha-Ras residues with those of Rap1A prompted us to examine if Rap1A lacks the ability to bind to Raf-1 CRR. In the same in vitrobinding assay, Rap1A bound to RBD in a GTP-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and2), although the GTP dependence of this binding was less clear compared with that of Ha-Ras (11Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, Rap1A bound efficiently to CRR (lanes 3 and 4). As observed for Ha-Ras, this binding was GTP-independent (lanes 3 and4) and required an intact zinc finger structure of CRR because Rap1A bound very poorly to MBP-Raf-1(132–206, C168S) (Fig.1 B). Binding of Rap1A to MBP-Raf-1(48–206) containing both RBD and CRR was severalfold stronger and less GTP-dependent than that to RBD (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5 and6). These results suggested that CRR is necessary for efficient association between Rap1A and Raf-1 and that CRR rather than RBD plays a major role in this association. Comparison of the binding properties between Ha-Ras and Rap1A is shown in Fig. 1 C. Ha-Ras bound to CRR yielded roughly 10-fold less signal than that to RBD even though the amounts of CRR in the binding reaction were doubled, indicating that the ability of Ha-Ras to bind to CRR was roughly 20-fold less than that to RBD. This estimation by immunoblot was consistent with our kinetic measurement of the affinity of Ha-Ras for RBD and CRR using a competitive inhibition of Ha-Ras-dependent activation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae adenylyl cyclase (15Minato T. Wang J. Akasaka K. Okada T. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20845-20851Google Scholar, 16Akasaka K. Tamada M. Wang F. Kariya K. Shima F. Kikuchi A. Yamamoto M. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5353-5360Google Scholar). 2C.-D. Hu, K. Kariya, and T. Kataoka, unpublished results. In a striking contrast, Rap1A bound to CRR yielded stronger signal than that to RBD under the same condition, indicating that it has the ability to bind equally to RBD and to CRR (see also Fig.1 A). After taking account of the observation that Rap1A yielded twice as much signal as Ha-Ras on the equimolar basis (Fig.1 D), the ability of Rap1A to bind to CRR was roughly 10-fold greater than that of Ha-Ras. In addition, the ability of Rap1A to bind to RBD was about one-half of that of Ha-Ras after the same normalization. These results indicated that Rap1A has greatly enhanced rather than impaired activity to bind to CRR. In our previous report, we found that the binding of Ha-Ras to CRR required post-translational modification (11Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Google Scholar). To test if binding of Rap1A to CRR was also dependent on its post-translational modification, we incubated RBD and CRR with a lysate of Sf9 cells expressing Rap1A. As shown in Fig. 1 E, RBD bound both modified and unmodified Rap1A represented by the faster and slower migrating bands, respectively, on the Western immunoblot as described before (17Kisella B.T. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8934-8938Google Scholar). In contrast, CRR bound only the modified form of Rap1A. These results indicated that binding of Rap1A to CRR also requires its modification. The above data are somewhat contradictory to our previous finding that binding to CRR is necessary for Raf-1 activation, because Rap1A can bind to CRR better than Ha-Ras and still cannot activate Raf-1. One possible explanation is that enhanced binding to CRR is detrimental to the activation of Raf-1. To test this possibility, we first screened for a Ha-Ras mutant whose binding to CRR was abnormally enhanced. After testing more than 40 mutants described previously (16Akasaka K. Tamada M. Wang F. Kariya K. Shima F. Kikuchi A. Yamamoto M. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5353-5360Google Scholar), the E31K mutant was found to possess roughly 10-fold higher activity to bind to CRR compared with wild type (Fig. 1 C). Next, we co-expressed Raf-1 with either Rap1AV12 or Ha-RasV12(E31K) mutant in Sf9 cells. The Raf-1 immunoprecipitates were examined for the activity to induce phosphorylation of KNERK2 in the presence of MEK (Fig.2 C). The results showed that Rap1AV12 and Ha-RasV12(E31K) indeed could not activate Raf-1 (lanes 1-4). Further, triple expression of either of them along with Ha-RasV12 and Raf-1 was found to suppress the activation of Raf-1 by Ha-RasV12(lanes 5 and 6). These data suggested that the enhanced binding to CRR is indeed detrimental to the activation of Raf-1. They also suggested the involvement of this enhanced binding in the suppressive action of Rap1A in Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation, which is examined in the following section. We reasoned that the greatly enhanced ability of Rap1A to bind to CRR found here may also be involved in competitive inhibition of Ras-Raf-1 association by Rap1A. Rap1A would inhibit association of Ras with a Raf-1 N-terminal region containing both RBD and CRR much more efficiently than that with RBD alone. To test this idea, we first incubated MBP-Raf-1(50–131) with a fixed amount of Ha-Ras and increasing amounts of Rap1A. As expected, the amount of bound Ha-Ras was found to be reduced by increasing amounts of Rap1A, whereas that of bound Rap1A was increased (Fig.3 A). We then tested MBP-Raf-1(48–206) in the same experiment. To our surprise, the binding of Ha-Ras to MBP-Raf-1(48–206) was found enhanced to some extent even when the amounts of bound Rap1A were increased (Fig. 3 B). The only possible explanation for these results would be that Rap1A and Ha-Ras co-associate with the same Raf-1 N-terminal molecule through their independent binding to CRR and RBD, respectively, and that these associations mutually stabilize each other. To test this possibility, we immobilized GST-Ha-Ras fusion protein onto glutathione-Sepharose and incubated it with Rap1A in the absence or the presence of MBP-Raf-1 fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 3 C, no Rap1A was found to be associated with GST-Ha-Ras when they were incubated in the absence of MBP-Raf-1 (lane 1). Incubation in the presence of MBP-Raf-1(50–131) did not result in association of Rap1A with GST-Ha-Ras either, whereas MBP-Raf-1(50–131) was associated with GST-Ha-Ras (lane 2). Remarkably, when incubated in the presence of MBP-Raf-1(48–206), not only MBP-Raf-1(48–206) but also Rap1A was found to be associated with GST-Ha-Ras (lane 3). These results indicated that Rap1A and Ha-Ras co-associate with Raf-1 N-terminal region only when it contains both RBD and CRR. Similar results could be obtained if association of GST-Ha-Ras with MBP-Raf-1(48–206) induced dimerization of MBP-Raf-1(48–206), leading to subsequent binding of Rap1A to the second MBP-Raf-1(48–206) molecule. However, induced dimerization of MBP-Raf-1(48–206) was not the case because incubation of GST-Ha-Ras and untagged Ha-Ras in the presence of MBP-Raf-1(48–206) (the same experiment as Fig.3 C, lane 3, except that Ha-Ras was used instead of Rap1A) did not result in any association between GST-Ha-Ras and Ha-Ras (data not shown). The current model of Ras-suppressive action of Rap1A involves competitive inhibition by Rap1A of the interaction between Ras and Raf-1 RBD (10Burgering B.M.T. Boss J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 18-22Google Scholar). However, we found in this study that Rap1A possessed greatly enhanced ability to bind to CRR, another Ras-binding domain identified by us (11Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Google Scholar) and others (18Ghosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F.G. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10000-10007Google Scholar, 19Ghosh S. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30785-30788Google Scholar, 20Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K. Ghosh S. Terrell R.S. Campbell-Burk S. Bell R.M. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9809-9812Google Scholar). This strong binding even resulted in the co-association of Rap1A and Ha-Ras with Raf-1 N-terminal region through their independent binding to CRR and RBD, respectively, and these bindings might mutually stabilize each other. Because we have previously shown that binding of Ras to both CRR and RBD is necessary for Raf-1 activation (11Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Google Scholar), it is very likely that this triple complex formation will result in impairment of Raf-1 activation due to the failure of Ha-Ras to bind to CRR. The previous observations that unmodified Rap1A cannot suppress Ras function (5Kitayama H. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4284-4288Google Scholar, 6Sakoda T. Kaibuchi K. Kishi K. Kishida S. Doi K. Hoshino M. Hattori S. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1705-1711Google Scholar) is also consistent with this, because we found that modification of Rap1A is essential for its binding to CRR. A study with Ras/Rap1A chimera indicated that transforming potential of Ras requires both of the two regions, residues 21–31 and 45–54. On the other hand, Rap1A anti-oncogenicity requires mainly residues 21–31, although residues 45–54 is also required for full activity to suppress transformation (21Zhang K. Noda M. Vass W.C. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R. Science. 1990; 249: 162-165Google Scholar). Disregarding residues that are changed conservatively, that are variable among the Ras family, and that are not exposed on the protein surface, three residues, 26, 31, and 45, have been postulated to determine whether the protein is oncogenic or anti-oncogenic (3Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Google Scholar, 21Zhang K. Noda M. Vass W.C. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R. Science. 1990; 249: 162-165Google Scholar, 22Marshall M.S. Davis L.J. Keys R.D.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 187-190Google Scholar, 24Nur-E-Kamal M.S.A. Sizeland A. D'Abaco G. Maruta H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1415-1418Google Scholar). In fact, replacements of residues 26 (or 26 plus 27), 31 (or 30 plus 31), or 45 of activated Ras with those of Rap1A resulted in attenuation of transforming activity (22Marshall M.S. Davis L.J. Keys R.D. Mosser S.D. Hill W.S. Scolnick E.M. Gibbs J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3997-4004Google Scholar, 24Nur-E-Kamal M.S.A. Sizeland A. D'Abaco G. Maruta H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1415-1418Google Scholar). However, it remained unclear which of these residues plays the most critical role. Residues 26–28 (including 26) and 42–49 (including 45) have been proposed to constitute a contiguous domain on the surface of Ras protein (3Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Google Scholar, 25Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shirouzu M. Ito Y. Hattori S. Furuyama S. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4661-4667Google Scholar). The domain, termed “activator domain,” was suggested to play an important role for activation of effectors through some physical interaction with them. In the previous study, we found that Ha-Ras proteins carrying mutations N26G and V45E failed to bind to Raf-1 CRR (11Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Google Scholar). These mutants were also incapable of activating Raf-1 in Sf9 cells. Based on these findings, we proposed that the activator domain interacts with Raf-1 CRR and that this interaction is essential for Raf-1 activation. This predicts that the inability of Rap1A to activate Raf-1 may result from its failure to bind to CRR, because Rap1A contains residues Gly26 and Glu45, which abolished binding to CRR in the context of Ha-Ras. Contrary to this expectation, we found here that Rap1A exhibited greatly enhanced rather than reduced binding to CRR. One explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that side chains of the activator domain residues such as 26 and 45, which are divergent between Ras and Rap1A, might not interact directly with CRR. Instead, the activator domain residues such as Phe28 and Lys42, which are conserved between Ras and Rap1A, might participate in direct interaction with CRR. Consistent with this idea, F28A and K42A mutations have been shown to impair activities of Ras (3Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Google Scholar,25Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shirouzu M. Ito Y. Hattori S. Furuyama S. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4661-4667Google Scholar). In the context of Ha-Ras, both Asn26 and Val45 might be necessary for these interacting residues to assume their functional conformation, which are destroyed by the N26G and V45E mutations. On the other hand, in the context of Rap1A, such effects of Gly26 and Glu45 might be masked by conformational effects of other flanking residues that are not conserved with Ha-Ras. In this regard, residue Lys31 of Rap1A might play a critical role because we found here that E31K mutation alone enhanced CRR binding in the context of Ha-Ras. A support for the conformational role of the residue 31 over the activator domain also comes from a study of Rap1A mutants. Nassaret al. recently solved the structure of Rap1A(E30D,K31E) double mutant complexed with RBD by x-ray crystallography (26Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Block C. Janknecht R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 723-729Google Scholar). Comparison of this structure with that of wild-type Rap1A complexed with RBD indicated that the mutation led to a movement by more than 1.2 Å of a loop containing residues 44–50, which overlapped with the activator domain. Thus, it is likely that residues 30 and 31 of Ras influence the conformation of the activator domain residues. In addition, Glu31 of Rap1A(E30D,K31E) was found to interact directly with Lys84 of Raf-1 RBD, suggesting that E31 of Ras takes part in the same ionic interaction. Nassar et al. also showed that Rap1A(E30D,K31E) and Rap1A(K31E) acquired an activity to stimulate transcription from a Ras-dependent promoterin vivo, albeit to a small extent, and argued that this is accounted for by a large increase in the affinity of Rap1A for RBD due to the newly created ionic interaction. However, the result is also consistent with our finding that the identity of the residue 31 affects CRR binding. The observed conformational change of the activator domain of Rap1A might have brought about a reduction in the affinity of the Rap1A activator domain for CRR to a level appropriate for Raf-1 activation, contributing to the acquisition of the Ras-like activity. Although the solution structure of CRR has been solved (27Mott H.R. Carpenter J.W. Zhong S. Ghosh S. Bell R.M. Campbell S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8312-8317Google Scholar), further understanding of the mechanism of CRR binding should await the structural analysis of the complex between CRR and Ras or Rap1A. We thank A.

Here we show that Rad and Gem bind to calmodulin (CaM)-Sepharose in vitro in a calcium-dependent manner and that Rad can be co-immunoprecipitated with CaM in C2C12 cells. The interaction is influenced by the guanine nucleotide binding state of Rad with the GDP-bound form exhibiting 5-fold better binding to CaM than the GTP-bound protein. In addition, the dominant negative mutant of Rad (S105N) which binds GDP, but not GTP, exhibits enhanced binding to CaM in vivo when expressed in C2C12 cells. Peptide competition studies and expression of deletion mutants of Rad localize the binding site for CaM to residues 278–297 at the C terminus of Rad. This domain contains a motif characteristic of a calmodulin-binding region, consisting of numerous basic and hydrophobic residues. In addition, we have identified a second potential regulatory domain in the extended N terminus of Rad which, when removed, decreases Rad protein expression but increases the binding of Rad to CaM. The ability of Rad mutants to bind CaM correlates with their localization in cytoskeletal fractions of C2C12 cells. Immunoprecipitates of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, the cellular effector of Ca2+-calmodulin, also contain Rad, and in vitro both Rad and Gem can serve as substrates for this kinase.

Rad is the prototypic member of a new class of Ras-like GTP-binding proteins that includes Gem and Kir (1Reynet C. Kahn C.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Google Scholar, 2Maguire J. Santoro T.

Kahn C.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Google Scholar, 2Maguire J. Santoro T. Jensen P. Siebenlist U. Yewdell J. Kelly K. Science. 1994; 265: 241-244Google Scholar, 3Cohen L. Mohr R. Chen Y.-Y.

The N terminus of Rad is extended by 88 amino acids, and Kir/Gem is extended by 72 amino acids in comparison to Ras, and the C terminus of each is extended by 31 amino acids. Although Rad and Kir/Gem share 100% identity in the final 11 amino acids, they lack a CAAX-like prenylation site present in other Ras-like molecules (8Casey P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 219-225Google Scholar, 9Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Google Scholar). Rad and Kir/Gem differ from each other and from other Ras-like proteins in the putative effector (G2) domain, suggesting that they interact with distinct GAPs or effector molecules. They also contain residues in the G3 consensus sequence for guanine nucleotide binding which are divergent from Ras (1Reynet C. Kahn C.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Google Scholar, 2Maguire J.

Witte O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bioessays. 1992; 14: 177-184Google Scholar), vesicular transport (11Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5049-5052Google Scholar, 12Cormont M. Tanti J.-F. Zahraoui A. Van Obberghen E. Tavitian A. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19491-19497Google Scholar), and cytoskeletal arrangement (13Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Google Scholar, 14Nishiyama T. Sasaki T. Takaishi K. Kato M. Yaku H. Araki K. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2447-2456Google Scholar). Rac and cdc42 have been shown to interact with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and to participate in signaling leading to activation of the Jun kinases (15Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Google Scholar, 16Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar). While the exact function of Rad and Kir/Gem is unknown, it has recently been reported in abstract that peptides based on the C terminus of Rad and Kir/Gem can bind to calmodulin (CaM)in vitro (17Berchtold, M. W., and Fischer, R. (1996) Keystone Symposia on Molecular and Cellular Biology, Tamarron, CO, Jan. 5–11, 1996, E7, 304 (abstr.), Keystone Symposia, Silverthorne, CO.Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the full-length Rad protein binds CaM in vitro and in vivo in a Ca2+-dependent manner and that the C-terminal residues 278–297 of human Rad are critical for this interaction. The binding of Rad and CaM is influenced by the guanine nucleotide bound state of Rad. We also demonstrate that Rad is present in complex with the cellular target of CaM, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which can phosphorylate both Rad and Gem in vitro. These findings suggest that the Rad family of Ras-like proteins may participate in Ca2+-triggered signaling events involving CaM and the CaMKII serine/threonine kinase cascade.DISCUSSIONRad and Kir/Gem are members of a novel class of Ras-related GTP-binding proteins that contain unique and extended N and C termini as compared with other Ras-like proteins (1Reynet C. Kahn C.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Google Scholar, 2Maguire J. Santoro T. Jensen P. Siebenlist U. Yewdell J. Kelly K. Science. 1994; 265: 241-244Google Scholar, 3Cohen L. Mohr R. Chen Y.-Y.

In this study we have shown that these extended domains are involved in binding of CaM. Thus, Rad and Gem bind CaM-Sepharose in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and in cells, Rad co-immunoprecipitates with CaM in a manner that is disrupted by EGTA treatment. Therefore, the Rad family of proteins joins the growing list of CaM-binding proteins, including CaMKII, myosin light chain kinase, phosphofructokinase, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase, neuromodulin, and, more recently, IQGAP1 and Ras-guanine nucleotide releasing factor (22Jarrett H.W. Madhavan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 362-371Google Scholar, 23Bagchi I.C. Huang Q. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3024-3029Google Scholar, 24Alexander K.A. Wakim B.T. Doyle G.S. Walsh K.A.

Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Google Scholar). Berchtold and Fischer (17Berchtold, M. W., and Fischer, R. (1996) Keystone Symposia on Molecular and Cellular Biology, Tamarron, CO, Jan. 5–11, 1996, E7, 304 (abstr.), Keystone Symposia, Silverthorne, CO.Google Scholar) have shown that a peptide corresponding to the final C-terminal 30 amino acids of Kir/Gem binds to CaM in vitro, and in the current study we find that a synthetic peptide based on the final 30 amino acids of Rad (residues 278–308) competes for Rad binding to CaM-Sepharose. Further evidence that the CaM-binding domain of Rad is indeed located in the C-terminal extended region involved deletion mutants. Thus, while deletion of residues 297–308 from full-length Rad did not disrupt CaM binding, deletion of residues 278–308 abolished CaM binding completely. Based on these mutants, the specific residues critical for the CaM interaction lie in the 19-amino acid region encompassing residues 278–297 of human Rad. Modeling of this region as a helical wheel confirms the distribution of charged and hydrophobic residues typical of CaM-binding protein. It is likely that the corresponding region of Gem, which shares 79% homology to Rad and is also rich in charged and hydrophobic residues, mediates its binding to CaM. We have shown previously that in C2C12 cells, GDP-bound Rad binds skeletal muscle β-tropomyosin following Ca2+ ionophore treatment (6Zhu J. Bilan P.J. Moyers J.S. Antonetti D.A. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 768-773Google Scholar). Although the region of Rad that mediates this interaction has not been determined, addition of a 5-fold molar excess of purified tropomyosin did not affect the interaction of Rad and CaM, suggesting that the binding regions reside in different locations in Rad (not shown).The Rad-CaM interaction appears to be dependent on the guanine nucleotide-bound state of Rad since GDP-loaded purified Rad and the Rad dominant negative mutant (S105N) expressed in cells exhibit increased binding to CaM in comparison to GTPγS-loaded Rad and WT Rad in cells. We speculated that CaM may thus serve to sequester Rad in its inactive GDP-bound form, serving as a “switching off” mechanism; however, we failed to show an affect of CaM binding on the guanine nucleotide binding state of Rad, suggesting that this may not be the case. Alternatively, in the presence of Ca2+, Rad may serve to sequester CaM. Additionally, we have previously shown that treatment of C2C12 cells with Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, results in a rapid degradation of Rad protein (6Zhu J. Bilan P.J. Moyers J.S. Antonetti D.A. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 768-773Google Scholar). It is possible that Ca2+-CaM serves a role in the switching off of Rad by facilitating the degradation of Rad by Ca2+-activated proteases. CaM does not catalyze the inactivation of Rad by GTP hydrolysis, since CaM alone does not significantly affect Rad intrinsic GTPase activity nor Rad-GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis.In addition to binding CaM, Rad exists in complex with CaMKII, the serine/threonine kinase which is a cellular target of CaM. Deletion of the CaM-binding domain of Rad, treatment of immune complexes with EGTA, and competition studies with the CaM-binding domain peptide indicate that Rad interacts with CaMKII independent of its association with Ca2+-CaM and that different domains of Rad are involved in these interactions. In addition, Rad and Gem serve as in vitro substrates for CaMKII. Although the significance of this phosphorylation is not yet known, it is possible that CaMKII modulates the function of Rad or its binding to CaM in a feedback mechanism. Two consensus sites for CaMKII phosphorylation (serines 273 and 299) reside near the region of CaM binding (1Reynet C. Kahn C.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Google Scholar) and could potentially modulate the Rad-CaM interaction by introducing a negative charge in the binding region.It has been noted that several CaM-binding proteins, including CaMKII and myosin light chain kinase, contain a “CaM-like binding site” within the sequence of the molecule (i.e. rich in hydrophobic/anionic residues) which is proposed to act as an internal inhibitor of CaM binding by interacting with the hydrophobic/cationic CaM-binding site within the protein (22Jarrett H.W. Madhavan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 362-371Google Scholar). Our mutagenesis studies suggest that Rad may have such a region in that deletion of the N-terminal 88 amino acids of Rad resulted in a molecule that exhibits enhanced binding to CaM-Sepharose. The region of Rad spanning residues 68–88 contains a number of hydrophobic and negatively charged residues, making it a potential auto-inhibitory domain (22Jarrett H.W. Madhavan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 362-371Google Scholar). Thus, the unique N- and C-terminal regions of Rad may co-regulate CaM interaction. It is possible, of course, that deletion of the N terminus results in a more generalized alteration in conformation, exposing the CaM-binding site or altering the guanine nucleotide binding characteristics of this protein. In addition, accurate quantitation of the CaM binding efficiency of the N-terminal deletion mutant (Rad N88) is difficult since so little of the protein is detectable in the soluble lysate samples.Unlike Ras, which is localized to the plasma membrane via prenylation of its C-terminal CAAX-like motif, Rad is localized mainly to the cytoplasm, with portions of the protein associated with cytoskeletal2 and membrane fractions (5Moyers J.S. Bilan P.J. Reynet C.R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23111-23116Google Scholar). Although Rad lacks a CAAX-like C-terminal motif, deletion of the C-terminal residues 278–308 displaced Rad from the cytoskeleton, membrane skeleton, and soluble membrane fractions to the cytosol, whereas deletion of residues 297–308 did not. Thus, the critical residues for Rad localization to membrane and cytoskeletal components correspond to the CaM-binding domain of Rad, residues 278–297. It is also possible that CaM binding serves to localize Rad. Consistent with this, deletion of the N terminus of Rad, which enhances CaM binding, correlates with displacement of Rad from the cytosol to the cytoskeleton, membrane skeleton, and soluble membranes. Alternatively, in addition to an intact N terminus, Rad localization may require residues near, but distinct from, those C-terminal residues required for CaM interaction.In summary, we have shown that the Ras-like GTPases, Rad and Gem, possess the unique quality of binding Ca2+-CaM and have localized the site of CaM binding to the C-terminal residues 278–297 of human Rad. The interaction of Rad and CaM is dependent on the guanine nucleotide bound state of Rad, and deletion mutations that affect binding result in redistribution of Rad in the cell. In addition, Rad is found in complex with CaMKII, and Rad and Gem serve asin vitro substrates for this kinase, suggesting that the Rad-like GTPases participate in Ca2+-activated signaling cascades leading to the activation of serine kinases. Rad is the prototypic member of a new class of Ras-like GTP-binding proteins that includes Gem and Kir (1Reynet C. Kahn C.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Google Scholar, 2Maguire J. Santoro T.

In humans, Rad is most highly expressed in the heart, lung, and skeletal muscle and expression is increased in the skeletal muscle of some type II diabetic humans (1Reynet C. Kahn C.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Google Scholar).

(4Zhu J. Reynet C. Caldwell J.S. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4805-4812Google Scholar). In cultured muscle and fat cells, Rad overexpression attenuates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake without altering expression or insulin-stimulated translocation of the Glut4 glucose transporter (5Moyers J.S. Bilan P.J. Reynet C.R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23111-23116Google Scholar). By expression library screening, Rad has been shown to interact with skeletal muscle β-tropomyosin, suggesting that Rad may participate in regulation of the cytoskeleton (6Zhu J. Bilan P.J. Moyers J.S. Antonetti D.A. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 768-773Google Scholar). The Gem gene product is expressed in the G1 phase in mitogen-activated T lymphocytes and shares approximately 60% amino acid identity with Rad (2Maguire J. Santoro T. Jensen P. Siebenlist U. Yewdell J. Kelly K. Science. 1994; 265: 241-244Google Scholar), whereas kir was isolated from a pre-B-cell library and is overexpressed in cells expressingBCR/ABL or v-abl (3Cohen L. Mohr R.

In addition, accurate quantitation of the CaM binding efficiency of the N-terminal deletion mutant (Rad N88) is difficult since so little of the protein is detectable in the soluble lysate samples.Unlike Ras, which is localized to the plasma membrane via prenylation of its C-terminal CAAX-like motif, Rad is localized mainly to the cytoplasm, with portions of the protein associated with cytoskeletal2 and membrane fractions (5Moyers J.S. Bilan P.J. Reynet C.R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23111-23116Google Scholar). Although Rad lacks a CAAX-like C-terminal motif, deletion of the C-terminal residues 278–308 displaced Rad from the cytoskeleton, membrane skeleton, and soluble membrane fractions to the cytosol, whereas deletion of residues 297–308 did not. Thus, the critical residues for Rad localization to membrane and cytoskeletal components correspond to the CaM-binding domain of Rad, residues 278–297. It is also possible that CaM binding serves to localize Rad. Consistent with this, deletion of the N terminus of Rad, which enhances CaM binding, correlates with displacement of Rad from the cytosol to the cytoskeleton, membrane skeleton, and soluble membranes. Alternatively, in addition to an intact N terminus, Rad localization may require residues near, but distinct from, those C-terminal residues required for CaM interaction.In summary, we have shown that the Ras-like GTPases, Rad and Gem, possess the unique quality of binding Ca2+-CaM and have localized the site of CaM binding to the C-terminal residues 278–297 of human Rad. The interaction of Rad and CaM is dependent on the guanine nucleotide bound state of Rad, and deletion mutations that affect binding result in redistribution of Rad in the cell. In addition, Rad is found in complex with CaMKII, and Rad and Gem serve asin vitro substrates for this kinase, suggesting that the Rad-like GTPases participate in Ca2+-activated signaling cascades leading to the activation of serine kinases. Rad and Kir/Gem are members of a novel class of Ras-related GTP-binding proteins that contain unique and extended N and C termini as compared with other Ras-like proteins (1Reynet C. Kahn C.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Google Scholar, 2Maguire J. Santoro T. Jensen P. Siebenlist U. Yewdell J. Kelly K. Science. 1994; 265: 241-244Google Scholar, 3Cohen L. Mohr R. Chen Y.-Y. Huang M. Kato R. Dorin D. Tamanoi F. Goga A. Afar D. Rosenberg N. Witte O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12448-12452Google Scholar). In this study we have shown that these extended domains are involved in binding of CaM. Thus, Rad and Gem bind CaM-Sepharose in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and in cells, Rad co-immunoprecipitates with CaM in a manner that is disrupted by EGTA treatment. Therefore, the Rad family of proteins joins the growing list of CaM-binding proteins, including CaMKII, myosin light chain kinase, phosphofructokinase, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase, neuromodulin, and, more recently, IQGAP1 and Ras-guanine nucleotide releasing factor (22Jarrett H.W. Madhavan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 362-371Google Scholar, 23Bagchi I.C. Huang Q. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3024-3029Google Scholar, 24Alexander K.A. Wakim B.T. Doyle G.S. Walsh K.A.

Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Google Scholar). Berchtold and Fischer (17Berchtold, M. W., and Fischer, R. (1996) Keystone Symposia on Molecular and Cellular Biology, Tamarron, CO, Jan. 5–11, 1996, E7, 304 (abstr.), Keystone Symposia, Silverthorne, CO.Google Scholar) have shown that a peptide corresponding to the final C-terminal 30 amino acids of Kir/Gem binds to CaM in vitro, and in the current study we find that a synthetic peptide based on the final 30 amino acids of Rad (residues 278–308) competes for Rad binding to CaM-Sepharose. Further evidence that the CaM-binding domain of Rad is indeed located in the C-terminal extended region involved deletion mutants. Thus, while deletion of residues 297–308 from full-length Rad did not disrupt CaM binding, deletion of residues 278–308 abolished CaM binding completely. Based on these mutants, the specific residues critical for the CaM interaction lie in the 19-amino acid region encompassing residues 278–297 of human Rad. Modeling of this region as a helical wheel confirms the distribution of charged and hydrophobic residues typical of CaM-binding protein. It is likely that the corresponding region of Gem, which shares 79% homology to Rad and is also rich in charged and hydrophobic residues, mediates its binding to CaM. We have shown previously that in C2C12 cells, GDP-bound Rad binds skeletal muscle β-tropomyosin following Ca2+ ionophore treatment (6Zhu J. Bilan P.J. Moyers J.S. Antonetti D.A. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 768-773Google Scholar). Although the region of Rad that mediates this interaction has not been determined, addition of a 5-fold molar excess of purified tropomyosin did not affect the interaction of Rad and CaM, suggesting that the binding regions reside in different locations in Rad (not shown). The Rad-CaM interaction appears to be dependent on the guanine nucleotide-bound state of Rad since GDP-loaded purified Rad and the Rad dominant negative mutant (S105N) expressed in cells exhibit increased binding to CaM in comparison to GTPγS-loaded Rad and WT Rad in cells. We speculated that CaM may thus serve to sequester Rad in its inactive GDP-bound form, serving as a “switching off” mechanism; however, we failed to show an affect of CaM binding on the guanine nucleotide binding state of Rad, suggesting that this may not be the case. Alternatively, in the presence of Ca2+, Rad may serve to sequester CaM. Additionally, we have previously shown that treatment of C2C12 cells with Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, results in a rapid degradation of Rad protein (6Zhu J. Bilan P.J. Moyers J.S. Antonetti D.A. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 768-773Google Scholar). It is possible that Ca2+-CaM serves a role in the switching off of Rad by facilitating the degradation of Rad by Ca2+-activated proteases. CaM does not catalyze the inactivation of Rad by GTP hydrolysis, since CaM alone does not significantly affect Rad intrinsic GTPase activity nor Rad-GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis. In addition to binding CaM, Rad exists in complex with CaMKII, the serine/threonine kinase which is a cellular target of CaM. Deletion of the CaM-binding domain of Rad, treatment of immune complexes with EGTA, and competition studies with the CaM-binding domain peptide indicate that Rad interacts with CaMKII independent of its association with Ca2+-CaM and that different domains of Rad are involved in these interactions. In addition, Rad and Gem serve as in vitro substrates for CaMKII. Although the significance of this phosphorylation is not yet known, it is possible that CaMKII modulates the function of Rad or its binding to CaM in a feedback mechanism. Two consensus sites for CaMKII phosphorylation (serines 273 and 299) reside near the region of CaM binding (1Reynet C. Kahn C.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Google Scholar) and could potentially modulate the Rad-CaM interaction by introducing a negative charge in the binding region. It has been noted that several CaM-binding proteins, including CaMKII and myosin light chain kinase, contain a “CaM-like binding site” within the sequence of the molecule (i.e. rich in hydrophobic/anionic residues) which is proposed to act as an internal inhibitor of CaM binding by interacting with the hydrophobic/cationic CaM-binding site within the protein (22Jarrett H.W. Madhavan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 362-371Google Scholar). Our mutagenesis studies suggest that Rad may have such a region in that deletion of the N-terminal 88 amino acids of Rad resulted in a molecule that exhibits enhanced binding to CaM-Sepharose. The region of Rad spanning residues 68–88 contains a number of hydrophobic and negatively charged residues, making it a potential auto-inhibitory domain (22Jarrett H.W. Madhavan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 362-371Google Scholar). Thus, the unique N- and C-terminal regions of Rad may co-regulate CaM interaction. It is possible, of course, that deletion of the N terminus results in a more generalized alteration in conformation, exposing the CaM-binding site or altering the guanine nucleotide binding characteristics of this protein. In addition, accurate quantitation of the CaM binding efficiency of the N-terminal deletion mutant (Rad N88) is difficult since so little of the protein is detectable in the soluble lysate samples. Unlike Ras, which is localized to the plasma membrane via prenylation of its C-terminal CAAX-like motif, Rad is localized mainly to the cytoplasm, with portions of the protein associated with cytoskeletal2 and membrane fractions (5Moyers J.S. Bilan P.J. Reynet C.R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23111-23116Google Scholar). Although Rad lacks a CAAX-like C-terminal motif, deletion of the C-terminal residues 278–308 displaced Rad from the cytoskeleton, membrane skeleton, and soluble membrane fractions to the cytosol, whereas deletion of residues 297–308 did not. Thus, the critical residues for Rad localization to membrane and cytoskeletal components correspond to the CaM-binding domain of Rad, residues 278–297. It is also possible that CaM binding serves to localize Rad. Consistent with this, deletion of the N terminus of Rad, which enhances CaM binding, correlates with displacement of Rad from the cytosol to the cytoskeleton, membrane skeleton, and soluble membranes.

Here we report that β cell-specific expression of the human islet amyloid polypeptide gene is principally regulated by promoter proximal sequences. The sequences that control tissue-specific expression were mapped between nucleotides −2798 and +450 of the human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) gene using transgenic mice. To localize the cis-acting elements involved in this response, we examined the effects of mutations within these sequences using transfected islet amyloid polypeptide promoter expression constructs in pancreatic β cell lines. The sequences between −222 and +450 bp were found to be necessary for β cell-specific expression. Linker-scanning mutations of the 5′-promoter proximal region defined several key distinct control elements, including a negative-acting element at −111/−102 base pairs (bp), positive-acting elements like the basic helix-loop-helix-like binding site at −138/−131 bp, and the three A/T-rich, homeobox-like sites at −172/−163, −154/−142, and −91/−84 bp. Mutations within any one of these elements eliminated transcriptional expression by the promoter. Gel mobility shift assays revealed that the PDX-1 homeobox factor, which is required for insulin gene transcription in β cells, interacted specifically at the −154/−142- and −91/−84-bp sites. Since PDX-1 is highly enriched in β and δ cells, these results suggest that this factor plays a principal role in defining islet β cell- and δ cell-specific expression of the IAPP gene.

Amyloid deposits are a common feature in individuals with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) 1The abbreviations used are: NIDDM, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; IAPP, islet amyloid polypeptide; LUC, luciferase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus, bp, base pair(s); B-HLH, basic helix-loop-helix; GH, growth hormone; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EF-1, elongation factor 1. 1The abbreviations used are: NIDDM, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; IAPP, islet amyloid polypeptide; LUC, luciferase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus, bp, base pair(s); B-HLH, basic helix-loop-helix; GH, growth hormone; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EF-1, elongation factor 1. (1O'Brien T.D. Westermark P. Betsholtz C. Johnson K.H. Shafrir E. Lessons from Animal Diabetes. IV. Smith-Gordon, London1993: 117-128Google Scholar). Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) or amylin, which is a member of the calcitonin gene family (2Zaidi M. Moonga B.S. Bevis P.J.R. Towhidul Alam A.S.M. Legon S. Wimalawansa S. MacIntyre I. Breimer L.H. Vitam. Horm. 1991; 46: 87-164Google Scholar), is the most abundant component of pancreatic amyloid. This 37-amino acid peptide is normally co-secreted with insulin from β cells (3Fehmann H.C. Weber V. Göke R. Göke B. Arnold R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 279-281Google Scholar) and is also expressed in a subset of islet δ cells (4Mulder H. Lindh A.-C. Sundler F. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 274: 467-474Google Scholar). The physiological role IAPP plays normally or in NIDDM is unclear. As a consequence of its abilities to inhibit insulin secretion in isolated islets (5Silvestre R.A. Peiro E. Degano P. Miralles P. Marco J. Regul. Pept. 1990; 31: 23-31Google Scholar, 6Degano P. Silvestre R.A. Salas M. Peiro E. Marco J. Regul. Pept. 1993; 43: 91-96Google Scholar) and to counteract insulin action in peripheral tissues (7Young A.A. Gedulin B. Wolfe-Lopez D. Greene H.E. Rink T.J. Cooper G.J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E274-E281Google Scholar), IAPP has been proposed to play an important role in regulating plasma glucose levels in mammals. The formation of diabetes-associated amyloid deposits appears to be related to the primary sequence of IAPP, as only certain species, which include primates and cats, encode a hydrophobic amyloidogenic core of amino acids (amino acids 20–29) that allow fibril formation (8Westermark P. Engström U. Johnson K.H. Westermark G.T. Betsholtz C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5036-5040Google Scholar). However, since amyloid deposits are not normally found in nondiabetic individuals, other factors must also contribute to disease formation. It has been proposed that elevated expression of IAPP may be one such factor (9O'Brien T.D. Butler P.C. Kreutter D.K. Kane L.A. Eberhardt N.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 609-616Google Scholar). Experiments conducted by German et al. (10German M.S. Moss L.G. Wang J. Rutter W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1777-1788Google Scholar) indicate that transcription of the IAPP gene is controlled by a factor that is also involved in β cell-specific expression of the insulin gene. Thus, it was demonstrated that the −176 to −117-bp region of the human IAPP gene could direct cell-specific transcription from a heterologous promoter in transient transfection assays with characteristics similar to the −247 to −197-bp region of rat insulin I gene. This region of the insulin gene I is regulated by A/T-rich elements and a basic helix-loop-helix (B-HLH) factor binding site (10German M.S. Moss L.G. Wang J. Rutter W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1777-1788Google Scholar, 11Karlsson O. Edlund T. Moss J.B. Rutter W.J. Walker M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8819-8823Google Scholar). The regulatory factors that bind to and activate the A/T-rich elements appear to be shared between the IAPP and insulin genes (10German M.S. Moss L.G. Wang J. Rutter W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1777-1788Google Scholar). The PDX-1 homeoprotein, which is selectively expressed in islet β and δ cells as well as specific enteroendocrine cell-types in the duodenum (12Guz Y. Montminy M.R. Stein R. Leonard J. Gamer L.W. Wright C. Teitelman G. Development. 1995; 121: 11-18Google Scholar), activates expression from A/T-rich elements of the insulin gene (13Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Google Scholar, 14Peshavaria M. Gamer L. Henderson E. Teitelman G. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol.

Sharma S. Teitelman G. Montminy M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 8: 1798-1806Google Scholar). Interestingly, homozygous PDX-1 mutant mice fail to form a pancreas (17Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund H. Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Google Scholar, 18Offield M.F. Jetton T.L. Stein R. Leonard J. Labosky T. Ray M. Magnuson M. Hogan B. Wright C.V.E. Development. 1996; 122: 983-995Google Scholar), and the enteroendocrine cells in the duodenum are also affected (18Offield M.F. Jetton T.L. Stein R. Leonard J. Labosky T. Ray M. Magnuson M. Hogan B. Wright C.V.E. Development. 1996; 122: 983-995Google Scholar). Recently, two laboratories have identified factors that appear to regulate expression from the promoter proximal A/T-rich elements in the IAPP gene. However, the conclusions drawn from these studies are quite different. Bretherton-Watt et al. (19Bretherton-Watt D. Gore N. Boam D.S.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 495-502Google Scholar) concluded that PDX-1 interacts with these A/T-rich elements in β cells, whereas Wang and Drucker (20Wang M. Drucker D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 243-251Google Scholar) demonstrated that a distinct factor, the LIM homeodomain protein Isl-1, can activate IAPP expression. In the present study, we have examined the effects of mutations throughout the human IAPP gene on β cell-type-specific expression. This resulted in the identification of a minimal control region spanning sequences from −222 to +450 bp, which was regulated by a number of distinct cis-acting elements. The positive control elements included the A/T-rich elements at −172/−163, −154/−142, and −91/−84 bp and a B-HLH-like binding site at −138/−131. In addition, this analysis identified a negative-acting element at −111/−102 bp. Using the gel shift assay, we found that PDX-1 composed the major β-cell binding activity with the human IAPP elements at −154/−142 and −91/−84 bp. In contrast, Isl-1 did not appear to bind to these elements. These results indicate that there are several distinct factors acting upon the sequences within the 5′-flanking region of the IAPP gene to control islet β cell-specific expression. Furthermore, one of these factors, PDX-1, is common to the insulin gene. The IAPP-GH fusion gene was constructed from human IAPP and growth hormone (GH) sequences using standard cloning techniques. IAPP sequences were isolated from the luciferase reporter plasmid pSLA12 (21Mosselman S. Höppener J.W.M. de Wit L. Soeller W. Lips C.J.M. Jansz H.S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 33-36Google Scholar) and spanned −2798 to +450 bp (exon 1 (102 bp) + intron 1 (333 bp) + exon 2 (15 bp)) of the human 5′-flanking and -untranslated leader region; human growth hormone sequences were obtained from the plck-hGH (22Chaffin K.E. Beals C.R. Wilkie T.M. Forbush K.A. Simon M.I. Perlmutter R.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3229-3821Google Scholar) plasmid, a gift of Dr. Roger Perlmutter. IAPP-GH DNA was injected into the male pronuclei of fertilized FVB/N mouse oocytes. Founder animals were identified using Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. IAPP-GH RNA was detected by Northern analysis in pancreas samples in one (strain HGC) of six germline positive founders. IAPP-GH expression was examined immunohistochemically in nontransgenic and the HGC transgenic strain using growth hormone (1:250 dilution, Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA) and insulin (1:400 dilution, Dako Laboratories, Carpinteria, CA) antiserum in 3–4-μm paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections by the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method as described previously (23Couce M. O'Brien T.D. Moran A. Roche P.C. Butler P.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1996; 81: 1267-1272Google Scholar). All of the IAPP promoter mutants were cloned into the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression vector, pTC, which is a Bluescript II SK− plasmid (Stratagene) containing the CAT reporter gene fused to β-globin poly(A) sequences. Each of the clones described below were verified by DNA sequencing. The 5′ deletion constructs were made with the human IAPP sequences in pSL (−2798 to +450; Ref. 21Mosselman S. Höppener J.W.M. de Wit L. Soeller W. Lips C.J.M. Jansz H.S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 33-36Google Scholar) using an exonuclease III/mung bean digestion kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The constructs were named according to their 5′-flanking end point. The exon I internal deletion mutants were generated in pAm-391 by standard molecular techniques. The intron I deletion mutant, pAm-241 (Δ+104 to +434), was constructed in pAm-241 by deleting the amylin intron 1. The oligonucleotide PCR primers spanned human IAPP sequences from −214/−231 (5′-AGATCTGATGGCAAATTC-3′) and bridged exon 1 and exon 2 (5′-CATTAAAAGAAAATTTGAGAAGCCATGG-3′). The IAPP-human elongation factor-1 (EF-1) intron mutants were generated by cloning EF-1 intron 2 (+1726 to +2091) and EF-1 intron 4 (+2674 to +2756) fragments generated by the PCR reaction between the IAPP +103 (exon 1) and +436 (exon 2) sequences in pAm-391 to yield pAm-391EF-1Int2 and pAm-391EF-1Int4. The IAPP promoter linker-scanning mutants were constructed in pAm-222 by a modification of the procedure of Gustin and Burke (24Gustin K.E. Burk R.D. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 22-23Google Scholar). The IAPP promoter mutant oligos used in the PCR reactions are listed in Fig.5. βTC3 (kindly provided by Shimon Efrat, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY), RINm5F (from ATCC), and HeLa S3 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All expression constructs were introduced into cells by electroporation with the Cell-porator (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) using conditions described previously (25Efrat S. Surana M. Fleischer N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11141-11143Google Scholar). Routinely, 10 μg of IAPP-CAT chimera was co-transfected along with 2 μg of RSV-long terminal repeat promoter luciferase (LUC) expression plasmid, RSV-LUC; the LUC activity from RSV-LUC was used to control for transfection efficiency. Expression from the IAPP-CAT constructs was compared with a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter-driven CAT reporter construct, pBLCAT2 (26Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Google Scholar), transfected in parallel. LUC and CAT activities were measured from 10 μg of crude extract 40–48 h after transfection. The protein concentration of the crude lysate was determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). CAT and LUC activities were determined using the methods described by Kingston and Sheen (28Kingston R.E. Sheen J. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley and Sons, New York1992: 1-14Google Scholar). Each experiment was repeated a minimum of 3 times. Nuclear extracts from βTC3 cells and human adult islets were prepared as described (29Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Google Scholar). βTC3 (0.5–10 μg) and islet (10 and 20 μg) extract protein were resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were either probed with N-terminal PDX-1 or Isl-1 K5 (31Tsuchida T. Ensini M. Morton S.B. Baldassare M. Edlund T. Jessell T.M. Pfaff S.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 957-970Google Scholar) polyclonal antisera (1:500 dilution in a buffer composed of 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCL, pH 7.5) + 0.5% Tween 20). The N-terminal XlHbox8 antisera was developed against the first 75 amino acids of theXenopus XlHbox8 protein and cross-reacts with the mouse PDX-1 protein (14Peshavaria M. Gamer L. Henderson E. Teitelman G. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 806-816Google Scholar); and the Isl-1 K-5 antisera was generated against C-terminal residues 178–349 of rat Isl-1 (31Tsuchida T.

The blot was washed and probed with peroxidase-conjugated protein A as described previously (14Peshavaria M. Gamer L. Henderson E. Teitelman G. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 806-816Google Scholar). The positions of the bound antibodies were detected by autoluminography with the ECL detection kit (Amersham Life Science Inc., Arlington Heights, IL). Nuclear extract (5 μg) from HeLa and βTC3 cell lines and human islet extracts were used in gel shift assays with double-stranded 32P-labeled human IAPP oligonucleotides probes (A1,−96GATGGAAATTAATGACAGAGG-76′; A2,−163ACTGATGAGTTAATGTAATAATGACC-138; A3,−183TATTTGCTACGTTAATATTTACT-161) using the conditions described previously (14Peshavaria M. Gamer L. Henderson E. Teitelman G. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 806-816Google Scholar). The sequence of the wild-type and mutant PDX-1 binding oligonucleotides in the rat insulin II gene (−213/−192 bp) have been described (14Peshavaria M. Gamer L. Henderson E. Teitelman G. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 806-816Google Scholar). The antibody addition experiments contained 3 μl of either N-terminal XlHbox 8, Isl-1 (A8 and K5), or Mox-2 antibodies. The Mox-2 antibody was raised to amino acids 2–139 of the mouse Mox-2 protein (30Candia A.F.C. Hu J. Crosby J. Lalley P.A. Noden D. Nadeau J. Wright C.V.E. Development. 1992; 116: 1132-1136Google Scholar); and Isl-1 A8 antisera was generated against residues 86–175 of chick Isl-1 (31Tsuchida T. Ensini M. Morton S.B. Baldassare M. Edlund T. Jessell T.M. Pfaff S.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 957-970Google Scholar). Preincubation reactions with antisera and βTC3 extract were conducted for 10 min at room temperature prior to initiation of the DNA binding reactions. The competition analyses were conducted with 100-fold excess of competitor DNA, the radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe, and extract. The samples were analyzed on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel run at 4 °C in TGE buffer (50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.5). After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. To localize the sequences of the human IAPP gene that were sufficient for islet-specific expression, a 3.3-kilobase region of the genomic clone λh201 (32Mosselman S. Höppener J.W.M. Lips C.J.M. Jansz H.S. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 154-158Google Scholar) was ligated to the human GH gene and expression examined in transgenic mice. The IAPP sequences contained within the IAPP-GH reporter included 2798 bp of 5′-flanking sequence, exon 1 (102 bp), intron 1 (333 bp), and a portion of exon 2 (15 bp). There were no IAPP protein coding sequences present in the GH reporter construct. IAPP-GH was subjected to pronuclear microinjection to generate six founder lines, one of which (line HGC) was shown by Northern analysis to express the transgene. To determine whether the transgene was expressed within islets, we prepared serial sections from the pancreas of transgenic and nontransgenic littermates and examined them for GH and insulin expression immunohistochemically (Fig. 1). We detected GH staining within the islets of transgenic mice but not their nontransgenic littermates. In contrast, insulin expression was observed in the islets of both sets of animals. The co-incidence of GH and insulin staining indicates that the majority of human GH-containing cells were β cells. These results are consistent with the expression pattern for the endogenous IAPP protein (4Mulder H. Lindh A.-C. Sundler F. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 274: 467-474Google Scholar). In contrast, GH staining was not detected in any other tissues tested, including kidney, liver, spleen, stomach, skin, muscle, and brain. 2W. C. Soeller, P. Roche, and P. C. Butler, unpublished results. These results indicated that the region from −2798 to +450 bp was sufficient to direct islet-specific expression of the IAPP gene. As a first step toward identifying the IAPP sequences within the −2798/+450 bp control region that were necessary for islet β cell expression, we subcloned a series of IAPP control region mutants into a bacterial CAT expression plasmid. The CAT activity from these chimeras was assayed in two well established, rodent, pancreatic islet β cell lines, βTC3 (mouse) and RIN-m5F (rat), and a non-IAPP producing cell line, HeLa S3 (human). The insulin and IAPP genes are expressed in both of these β cell lines (10German M.S. Moss L.G. Wang J. Rutter W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1777-1788Google Scholar, 15Petersen H.V. Serup P.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 33-36Google Scholar, 42Nagamatsu S. Nishi M. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13737-13741Google Scholar). IAPP-CAT activity was compared with pTC, the parent CAT expression vector, and a ubiquitously expressed herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter-driven CAT reporter construct, pBLCAT2. CAT activity from each transfected construct was normalized to the activity obtained from a cotransfected Rous sarcoma virus-luciferase expression plasmid. To determine the exon 1 and intron 1 sequences that were important in expression, internal deletion mutants within these regions were constructed in the context of human IAPP sequences spanning −391/+450 (Fig. 2) or −241/+450 (Fig. 3). There was only a small change in IAPP-CAT reporter gene activity as a consequence of this 5′ deletion (compare pAm-391 with pAm-222 in Fig.4). All of the exon 1 deletion mutants were active in the transfected β cell lines and inactive in HeLa cells (Figs. 2 and3; data not shown). The activity of the largest exon 1 deletion mutant, which spanned sequences from +5 to +47 bp, was reduced approximately 2.8-fold when compared with pAm-391 (Fig. 2, B andC). In contrast, precise deletion of intron 1 from pAm-241 resulted in a 20-fold drop in activity (Fig. 3 A). To determine whether the loss in pAm-241Δ104–434 activity resulted from the removal of essential cis-active transcriptional control sequences, we replaced the IAPP intron with nonrelated intron sequences from the generally expressed elongation factor 1 (EF-1) gene (33Uetsuki T. Naito A. Nagata S. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5791-5798Google Scholar). The activity of the constructs containing either EF-1 intron 2 or EF-1 intron 4 sequences were very similar to the IAPP wild-type construct (compare pAm-391 with either pAm-391EF-1Int2 or pAm-391EF-1Int4 in Fig.3 B). Together, these results indicate that IAPP transgene transcription within β cells was not profoundly affected by the human IAPP noncoding sequences present in the construct. However, our results suggest that a post-transcriptional processing event may have been very important in the expression of IAPP-GH. We therefore have retained the IAPP noncoding sequences to +450bp within each of the 5′-flanking control region mutant constructs in the studies described below.Figure 3Analysis of the expression of intron 1 mutants in βTC-3 cells.

The results represent the normalized mean percent CAT acetylation (%CAT) from three independent transfections ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify the 5′-flanking region sequences within the human IAPP promoter that were important in β-cell expression, we generated a series of 5′-flanking IAPP-CAT deletion constructs. The expression pattern obtained with these mutants was similar between the β cell lines, βTC3 and RIN-m5F (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, the chimera with only 222 bp of upstream sequence, pAm-222, had approximately the same activity as the −2798 construct, pAm-2798. In contrast, deletion of the IAPP sequences between −222 to −138 resulted in a 6–10-fold drop in activity in both β cell lines. This region contains the A/T-rich motifs that appear to be functionally similar to those of the insulin gene (10German M.S. Moss L.G. Wang J. Rutter W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1777-1788Google Scholar). The generally lower activity of the IAPP-CAT construct in RIN-m5F cells, when compared with βTC-3, is also reflected in their IAPP and insulin levels (21Mosselman S. Höppener J.W.M. de Wit L. Soeller W. Lips C.J.M. Jansz H.S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 33-36Google Scholar, 42Nagamatsu S. Nishi M. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13737-13741Google Scholar). All of the 5′-deletion constructs were inactive in HeLa cells (Fig.4 D). These studies indicate that the sequences between −222 to +450 bp are responsible for directing IAPP gene expression to β cells. To identify the IAPP control elements within the 5′ proximal region that were important in β cell-type-specific activity, we constructed a series of 10-bp linker-scanner mutants between positions −211 and −32 bp in pAm-222 (Fig. 5). This strategy allowed us to analyze the importance of small regions of the IAPP gene in transcriptional control without altering the spacing between putative promoter elements. The activity of each construct was assayed in βTC3 and RINm5f cells. There were several IAPP promoter sequences sensitive to mutation in transfected β cells (Fig. 5). In some instances, we observed that mutant IAPP-CAT activity was reduced primarily in only one of the β cell lines. In this category were the mutants at −201/−192, and −81/−71 bp. We presume that their activators were only limiting for IAPP-CAT expression in the sensitive β cell line. We believe that the more interesting mutants were those that influenced IAPP-CAT activity in both RIN-m5F and βTC-3 cells as these probably represent the action of regulators that are essential for transcription. The phenotype of these mutants indicates that IAPP gene expression is regulated by both positive- and negative-acting cellular activities. Thus mutations within activator sites, like the A/T-rich elements at −172/−163, −154/−142, and −91/−84 bp or the B-HLH-like site at −138/−131, reduced activity by 65–75% (compare the activity of the C, D, E, F, G, and L mutants with pAm-222 in Fig. 5 A). In accordance with the nomenclature used in naming the A/T-rich and B-HLH sites in the insulin gene (34German M. Ashcroft S. Docherty K. Edlund H. Edlund T. Goodison S. Imura H. Kennedy G. Madsen O. Melloul D. Moss L. Olson K. Permutt M. Phillippe J. Robertson R. Rutter W. Serup P. Stein R. Steiner D. Tsai M.-J. Walker M. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1002-1004Google Scholar), the A/T-rich elements at −172/−163, −154/−142, and −91/−84 bp will be referred to as A3, A2, and A1, respectively, and the B-HLH-like site as E1. Each of the A and E element mutants profoundly affected pAm-222 activity, implying that the activators functioning at these sites act cooperatively to mediate IAPP expression. In contrast to the A/T-rich and B-HLH-like site mutants, the properties of −111/−102 mutant indicates that it is a repressor binding site. This result does not appear to be caused by artifactual generation of an activator binding site since the 2–8-fold increase in activity observed with the −111/−102 site mutant was also obtained with two other linker-scanner mutants over this region. 3M. D. Carty, J. S. Lillquist, and W. C. Soeller, unpublished results. The gel mobility shift assay was used to determine the distribution of the cellular factors interacting with the A1, A2, and A3 elements. Nuclear extracts were prepared from βTC3 and HeLa S3 cells. Binding reactions were conducted in the presence of extract and32P-labeled human IAPP A-element probes spanning sequences at −183/−161 (A3), −163/−138 (A2), and −96/−76 (A1) bp. Binding to these IAPP elements was compared with the insulin A2 element binding site at −213 to −192 bp, which interacts with the PDX-1 transcription factor (14Peshavaria M. Gamer L. Henderson E. Teitelman G. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 806-816Google Scholar). Several protein-DNA complexes were detected with these IAPP probes in these extracts (Fig. 6). Specificity of binding was determined in competition assays with wild-type IAPP and with wild-type and mutant alleles of the insulin −213/−192 element as competitors. The competition pattern indicates that there was at least one common, specific protein-IAPP element complex detected using βTC3 cell extract with the A1 and A2 probes (Fig. 6, A andB). This complex composes the major β cell binding activity and co-migrates with the PDX-1-insulin complex (Fig.6 D); it was not detected in HeLa extracts (Fig. 6). The presence of PDX-1 in this complex was also confirmed by antibody-supershift analysis. Thus, the addition of an antibody that recognizes PDX-1 specifically super-shifted this complex with the IAPP A1 and A2 probes, whereas there was no"

In cultured R3T3 cells, expression of this receptor is markedly induced at the confluent state and with serum deprivation. In this study we demonstrated that the removal of serum from culture media resulted in the induction of apoptosis in these cells and the addition of angiotensin II further enhanced apoptosis. We have previously identified an interferon regulatory factor (IRF) binding motif in the mouse AT2 receptor gene promoter region. In this report, we observed that serum removal increased IRF-1 expression, with a rapid and transient decrease of IRF-2. To prove that the changes in IRFs after serum removal mediated apoptosis and up-regulated AT2receptor, we transfected antisense oligonucleotides for IRF-1 or IRF-2 into R3T3 cells and observed that IRF-1 antisense oligonucleotide attenuated apoptosis and abolished the up-regulation of AT2receptor. IRF-2 antisense oligonucleotide pretreatment did not affect the onset of apoptosis after serum removal; instead, it increased AT2 receptor binding and enhanced angiotensin II-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that increased IRF-1 after serum starvation contributes to the induction of apoptosis and that increased IRF-1 up-regulates the AT2 receptor expression after serum starvation, resulting in enhanced angiotensin II-mediated apoptosis.

Most of the known effects of Ang II in adult tissues are mediated by the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor. Recently, a second receptor subtype known as AT2 receptor has been cloned by us and others (1Mukoyama M. Nakajima M. Horiuchi M. Sasamura H,. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24539-24542Google Scholar, 2Kambayashi Y. Bardhan S. Takahashi K. Tsuzuki S. Inui H. Hamakubo T. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24543-24546Google Scholar). The AT2 receptor is abundantly and widely expressed in fetal tissues, but present only in at limited levels in adult tissues such as adrenal medulla, specific brain regions, uterine myometrium, heart, and atretic ovarian follicles (3Daud A.I.

Sen I. Bumpus F.M. Husain A. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1947-1959Google Scholar). The highly abundant expression of this receptor during embryonic and neonatal growth and quick disappearance after birth has led to the suggestion that this receptor is involved in growth, development, and/or differentiation. Our studies using in vivo gene transfer of the rat AT2 receptor into an injured rat carotid artery have demonstrated an attenuation of neointimal hyperplasia resulting from AT2 receptor transgene overexpression (9Nakajima, M., Hutchinson, H., Fujinaga, M., Hayashida, W., Morishita, R., Zhang, L., Horiuchi, M., Pratt, R. E., and Dzau, V. J. (1997)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press.Google Scholar), and Stollet al. (10Stoll M. Steckelings M. Paul M. Bottari S.P. Metzger R. Unger T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 651-65712Google Scholar) also demonstrated that the antiproliferative actions of the AT2 receptor offset the growth promoting effects mediated by the AT1 receptor. Greater than 99.9% of the ovarian follicles present at birth undergo atresia, an event dependent on apoptosis or “programmed cell death.” Interestingly, AT2 receptor expression is tightly associated with ovarian follicular atresia (3Daud A.I. Bumpus F.M. Husain A. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2727-2734Google Scholar, 8Pucell A.G. Hodges J.C. Sen I. Bumpus F.M. Husain A. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1947-1959Google Scholar). AT2receptor is also abundantly expressed in immature brain and some specific regions of the brain (5Tsutsumi K. Saavedra J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H667-H670Google Scholar, 6Tsutsumi K. Stromberg C. Viswanathan M. Saavedra J.M. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1075-1082Google Scholar). Approximately half of the neurons produced during embryogenesis die by apoptosis before adulthood. These results have led us to examine the role of AT2 receptor in apoptosis. We recently demonstrated that the activation of the AT2 receptor induces apoptosis in a rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12W) and confluent mouse fibroblast cell line (R3T3 cell) (11Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 156-160Google Scholar). These cells have been shown to express abundant AT2receptor (12Speth R.C. Kim K.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 997-1006Google Scholar, 13Dudley D.T. Hubbell S.E. Summerfelt R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 360-367Google Scholar, 14Dudley D.T. Summerfelt R.M. Regul. Pept. 1993; 44: 199-206Google Scholar). We further observed that higher AT2receptor expression is especially associated with apoptosis (11Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 156-160Google Scholar). In R3T3 cells, AT2 receptor expression is regulated by the growth state of the cells. AT2 receptor binding density is very low in actively growing cells, but increases markedly in the confluent, quiescent state (13Dudley D.T. Hubbell S.E. Summerfelt R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 360-367Google Scholar, 14Dudley D.T. Summerfelt R.M. Regul. Pept. 1993; 44: 199-206Google Scholar). We recently reported that the growth-regulated AT2 receptor expression in R3T3 cells is transcriptionally controlled by the competitive binding of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and IRF-2 for an IRF binding sequence in the AT2 receptor promoter region (15Horiuchi M. Koike G. Yamada T. Mukoyama M. Nakajima M. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20225-20230Google Scholar). IRF-1 and IRF-2 are structurally related, particularly in their amino-terminal regions that confer DNA binding specificity. They recognize the same DNA sequence elements (IRF-Es) (16Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Google Scholar, 17Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Google Scholar). IRF-1 functions as a transcriptional activator, whereas IRF-2 represses IRF-1 function by competing for the same cis-element (16Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Google Scholar, 17Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell.

Fujita T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1990; 63: 303-312Google Scholar). It has been shown that the growth state of certain cells depends on a balance between IRF-1 and IRF-2,i.e. a change in the IRF-1/IRF-2 ratio perturbs cell growth control (20Yamada G. Ogawa M. Akagi K. Miyamoto H. Nakano N. Itoh S. Miyazaki J. Nishikawa S. Yamamura K. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 88: 532-536Google Scholar, 21Watanabe N. Sakakibara J. Hovanessian A.G.

We hypothesized that changes in the ratio of IRFs under specific conditions regulate AT2receptor expression which subsequently influences apoptosis. We studied the effect of serum starvation on R3T3 cells and observed that an increase in IRF-1 with transient decrease in IRF-2 stimulated AT2 receptor expression and enhanced AT2receptor-mediated apoptosis. R3T3 cells were cultured as described (13Dudley D.T. Hubbell S.E. Summerfelt R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 360-367Google Scholar) using Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were seeded at 7 × 104cells/T-75 flask (Falcon) for transfection experiments for internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (DNA laddering), and cells were seeded on a 24-well plate (surface area, 2 cm2) (Falcon) at 2.5 × 104 cells/well for receptor binding studies. Two days after reaching confluent state, the cells were used for experiments. Cell number was counted by Coulter counter. Oligonucleotides used for treating cultured R3T3 cells as “decoy” include the following: IRF binding, 5′-GAAAAAGAGAAAGAGAAAATTCTGCTAAAAATGATA-3′ mutant IRF binding, 5′-GAAAAAAGGAAAAGGAAAATTCTGCTAAAAAGGATA-3′. In mutant IRF-binding oligonucleotide, three repeats of putative IRF binding hexamer motif as previously reported (15Horiuchi M. Koike G. Yamada T. Mukoyama M. Nakajima M. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20225-20230Google Scholar) were replaced with C4 oligomer (AAAGGA), which does not bind to IRFs (16Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were annealed to complementary sequences and used as double-stranded oligonucleotides. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides for treating cells as antisense DNA for IRF-1 and IRF-2 are as follows: IRF-1 antisense, 5′-GAAAGATGCCCGAGATGC-3′ (−111/−94) (24Miyamoto M. Fujita T. Kimura Y. Maruyama M Harada H. Sudo Y. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1988; 54: 903-913Google Scholar), IRF-2 antisense, 5′-GTGTGAGTGTTGTTAGGG-3′ (−71/−54) (16Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y.

The transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), 3:1 (w/w) liposome formulation of the polycationic lipid 2,3-dioleyloxy-N-[2(sperminecarboxamide)ethyl]-N,N-dimethyl-1-propanaminium trifluoroacetate (DOSPA) and the neutral lipid dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated with the oligonucleotides (0.5 μm) and LipofectAMINE (1:3, w/w) for 3 h, and the transfection reagent was replaced with culture medium as described in each figure legend. Cells on the wells were washed twice with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Reactions were performed with 0.2 nm125I-CGP42112A (2,176 Ci mmol−1, Peptide Radioiodination Center, Washington State University) at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and solubilized with 200 μl of 0.5n NaOH and solubilized material was counted for radioactivity. Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled CGP42112A. Total RNA was prepared from cultured R3T3 cells using RNAzol (Tel-Test), reverse transcribed using reverse transcriptase and random hexamers (Perkin-Elmer), and applied to PCR. PCR primers for IRF-1 used were as follows: 5′-CCTGATGACCACAGCAGTTAC-3′ and 5′-CTTCATCTCCGTGAAGACATG-3′. For IRF-2, PCR primers were 5′-GCGGTCCTGACTTCAGCTATA-3′ and 5′-CTTCTTGATGACACTGGCCGG-3′. PCR reaction was carried out with 30 cycles of 1 min f denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min of annealing at 55 °C, and 3 min of extension at 72 °C, followed by 15 min of final extension step. PCR-amplified DNAs were subcloned into pCR™II Vector (Invitrogen). cDNA probes for Northern blotting were prepared from these plasmid vector by restriction enzyme cut by EcoRI. Total RNA was prepared from cultured R3T3 cells using RNAzol (Tel-Test) 24 h after oligonucleotide treatment. RNA (20 μg/lane) was separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Amersham), and hybridization was carried out using a 32P-labeled IRF-1 and IRF-2 cDNA, a32P-labeled HindIII-NsiI fragment of mouse AT2 receptor cDNA (25Nakajima M. Mukoyama M. Pratt R.E. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 393-399Google Scholar), or 0.78-kbPstI-XbaI fragment of a human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase clone. Densitometric analysis of autoradiograms was performed by scanning densitometer (GS300, Hoeffer) and NIH Image software. R3T3 cells were seeded onto 10-cm dishes (Falcon) at 2 × 10−6 cells/dish for this experiment. The cells were washed with HEPES-buffered saline and lysed in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 8,500 × g for 20 min, boiled in Laemmli loading buffer for 3 min, resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with IRF-1 or IRF-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody using the ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) system (Amersham). DNA extraction, subsequent 3′ end-labeling of DNA, gel electrophoresis, and quantitation of DNA fragmentation were performed as described previously (26Tilly J.L. Hsueh A.J.W. J. Cell Physiol. 1993; 154: 519-526Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 ng of DNA prepared from each treated cells was end-labeled with [α-32P]ddATP (Amersham) and terminal transferase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 60 min at 37 °C. Labeled DNA was loaded onto a 2% agarose gel, separated by electrophoresis, and autoradiographed. The amount of radiolabeled ddATP incorporated into low (<20 kb) molecular weight DNA fractions were quantitated by cutting the respective fraction of DNA from the dried gel and counting in a β-counter. The results were expressed as percentage of the counts in control samples as described in each figure legend. R3T3 cells seeded onto six-well plates (Falcon) were used for this experiment. Chromatin binding dyes (Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide (Molecular Probes)) were added to the serum-free medium at a concentration of 5 or 10 μm to examine the morphological changes of nuclei. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, cells were collected. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and cells were viewed under UV microscopy. All values are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Scheffe's test. p < 0.01 was considered to be significant. We first examined the changes of IRF-1 and IRF-2 gene expressions after serum removal which induces apoptosis in this cell line (11Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 156-160Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, expression of IRF-1 increased in a time-dependent manner and showed a maximum at 24 h after serum removal, whereas IRF-2 mRNA transiently decreased 3 h after serum removal and returned to basal level at 24 h. To document that these change in IRF-1 and IRF-2 contributed to the increased AT2 receptor expression, we treated confluent R3T3 cells with double-stranded oligonucleotides spanning the IRF-Es in the mouse AT2receptor promoter region (15Horiuchi M. Koike G. Yamada T. Mukoyama M. Nakajima M. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20225-20230Google Scholar) as transcriptional factor decoy, which could bound with IRF-1 and IRF-2 in R3T3 cells (15Horiuchi M. Koike G. Yamada T. Mukoyama M. Nakajima M. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20225-20230Google Scholar). This strategy is based on the competition for binding to a specific transcription factor between a cis-element present in an endogenous target gene and an exogenously added oligonucleotide corresponding to thatcis-sequence. One day after transfection of the oligonucleotides, the cells were placed in serum-free medium, and AT2 receptor binding was determined 3 days later by radioligand receptor binding assay. As shown in Fig.2 A, serum depletion enhanced AT2receptor binding. Pretreatment with IRF-binding decoy oligonucleotide attenuated the increase of AT2 receptor in response to serum removal. IRF-binding decoy oligonucleotide treatment did not change the AT2 receptor density in serum-fed R3T3 cells. Mutant IRF-binding decoy oligonucleotide treatment did not affect AT2 receptor density. We also measured AT2receptor mRNA levels at 24 h after serum removal and observed that pretreatment with IRF-binding decoy oligonucleotide inhibited the AT2 receptor mRNA increase (Fig. 2 B), supporting the contention that the change in the ratio of IRF-1/IRF-2 after serum depletion is important for the transcriptional up-regulation of AT2 receptor expression.Figure 2Effects of oligonucleotides spanning IRF binding sequence in mouse AT2 receptor promoter region and antisense oligonucleotides for IRF-1 and IRF-2 on AT2receptor expression after serum starvation. Two double-stranded oligonucleotides (IRF and mutant IRF-binding decoy oligonucleotides) (see “Experimental Procedures”) were transfected into confluent R3T3 cells, and 1 day after oligonucleotides transfection, serum was removed from the medium. The AT2 receptor binding was determined 3 days after serum removal by radioligand binding assay.A, the values were expressed as mean ± S.D. obtained from five different culture wells. Total RNA was prepared from R3T3 cells 24 h after serum removal or serum-fed cells. RNA (20 μg/lane) was separated by electrophoresis and hybridization was carried with a probe for the AT2 receptor or for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a control. Similar results were obtained in three different experiments (B). Antisense oligonucleotides for IRF-1 and IRF-2 were transfected into R3T3 cells. One day after oligonucleotide transfection, serum was removed from the medium. The AT2 receptor binding was determined 3 days after serum removal by radioligand binding assay (C). The values were expressed as mean ± S.D. obtained from five different cell culture wells. * shows p < 0.01 compared with LipofectAMINE transfection alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To prove that the changes of IRF-1 and IRF-2 expression after serum depletion regulates the AT2 receptor expression, we transfected antisense oligonucleotides for IRF-1 or IRF-2 into R3T3 cells 24 h before serum removal. To confirm whether these antisense oligonucleotides inhibit IRFs expression, we examined the IRFs protein expression 12 h after serum depletion. As shown in Fig. 3, consistent with the mRNA expression of IRF-1 (Fig. 1 A), we observed that IRF-1 protein was up-regulated after serum depletion and IRF-1 antisense pretreatment inhibited increased IRF-1 expression, whereas IRF-1 sense and IRF-2 sense and antisense oligonucleotides did not influence the IRF-1 expression. On the other hand, IRF-2 protein level was not changed 12 h after serum depletion, although IRF-2 mRNA transiently decreased 3 h after serum removal and returned to basal level rapidly. IRF-2 antisense oligonucleotide treatment decreased the expression of IRF-2. Next we examined the effects of IRFs antisense oligonucleotides on AT2 receptor expression and observed that IRF-2 antisense enhanced AT2 receptor binding and IRF-1 antisense oligonucleotide attenuated AT2 receptor binding in confluent serum-fed R3T3 cells (Fig. 2 C). We demonstrated further that IRF-1 antisense oligonucleotide pretreatment abolished the up-regulation of AT2 receptor after serum removal (Fig.2 C), demonstrating that the increase in IRF-1 mediated the up-regulation of AT2 receptor expression. In the serum-depleted state, IRF-2 antisense treatment increased the AT2 receptor density. These data suggest that increased IRF-1 and decreased IRF-2 after serum removal may exert synergistic effects on AT2 receptor up-regulation. To test the possibility that the increased expression of IRF-1 in R3T3 cells after serum growth factor removal contributes to the induction of apoptosis, we treated the R3T3 cells with antisense oligonucleotides for IRF-1 or IRF-2 1 day before serum starvation. As shown in Fig. 4, serum depletion induced the internucleosomal cleavage of DNA, which resulted in the generation of DNA fragments of multiples of ∼180 base pairs (the size of a nucleosome): a hallmark of apoptosis. IRF-1 antisense oligonucleotide treatment inhibited DNA fragmentation in serum-starved R3T3 cells, whereas IRF-1 antisense did not affect DNA fragmentation in serum-fed R3T3 cells, suggesting that the increase of IRF-1 after serum depletion plays a critical role in the induction of apoptosis. On the other hand, IRF-2 antisense oligonucleotide did not influence the development of apoptosis. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the transient decrease of IRF-2 mRNA after serum starvation as shown in Fig. 1 enhanced the IRF-1 effect and consequently contributed to the process of apoptosis as well. In addition to the DNA fragmentation, we also examined the morphological changes of apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 5, serum depletion caused apoptotic morphological changes in R3T3 cells. IRF-1 antisense oligonucleotide pretreatment attenuated the induction of apoptosis after serum growth factor removal, consistent with the results of DNA laddering.Figure 5Morphological changes of apoptosis in R3T3 cells. The chromatin binding dye Hoechst 33342 stains cells with intact plasma membrane and propidium iodide stains cells with loss of plasma membrane integrity. A, R3T3 cells were maintained in 10% fetal calf serum. B, serum was depleted from the medium, and typical morphological changes of the apoptosis were observed 2 days after serum starvation, showing nuclear condensation (D) and fragmentation (E and F).C, morphological apoptotic changes were attenuated by pretreatment of IRF-1 antisense oligonucleotide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown in Figs. 6and 7, Ang II (10−7m) treatment further enhanced DNA fragmentation after serum removal, and this effect was blocked by the specific AT2 receptor antagonist, PD123319 (Fig. 6, A and B). The effect of Ang II on the induction of apoptosis was observed both in serum-fed and serum-starved cells; however, the effect of Ang II was significantly greater in serum-starved cells. Next we examined the effects of IRFs on AT2 receptor-mediated DNA fragmentation after serum removal (Fig. 7, A and B). Antisense oligonucleotides for IRF-1 and IRF-2 were transfected into R3T3 cells; serum was removed from the culture medium 1 day after antisense transfection. The cells were then stimulated with Ang II (10−7m). Three days after Ang II stimulation, DNA fragmentation was measured. IRF-1 antisense pretreatment inhibited Ang II-mediated DNA fragmentation, whereas IRF-2 antisense pretreatment further enhanced the effect of Ang II as a result of an increased expression of AT2 receptor as shown in Fig. 2 C. Taken together these results suggest that the up-regulated AT2 receptor density, as a result of the changes in IRF-1 and IRF-2, enhances the AT2 receptor-mediated apoptosis after serum depletion.Figure 7Attenuation of AT2receptor-mediated apoptosis by IRF-1 antisense oligonucleotide.Confluent R3T3 cells were treated with antisense (AS) and sense (S) oligonucleotides for IRF-1 and IRF-2. One day after oligonucleotide transfection, serum was removed and cells were incubated with or without Ang II (10−7m) for 3 days. Quantitative analysis was performed by calculating the radioactivity incorporated into the low molecular weight fraction (<20 kb) divided by the radioactivity of serum-fed, non-treated cells (n = 4 each condition, mean ± S.D.). * showsp < 0.01 versus serum-starved, non-Ang II-treated cells. † shows p < 0.01 versusserum-starved, Ang II-treated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The antigrowth effects of AT2 receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells (9Nakajima, M., Hutchinson, H., Fujinaga, M., Hayashida, W., Morishita, R., Zhang, L., Horiuchi, M., Pratt, R.

Peptides. 1992; 13: 783-786Google Scholar) suggest that this receptor is closely involved with growth, development, and/or differentiation. Dudley et al. (14Dudley D.T. Summerfelt R.M. Regul. Pept. 1993; 44: 199-206Google Scholar) reported that the addition of growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor or serum, to quiescent R3T3 cells caused a rapid decrease in the number of surface AT2 receptor sites. Leung et al. (30Leung K.H. Roscoe W.A. Smith R.D. Timmermans P.B.W.M. Chiu A.T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 227: 63-70Google Scholar) reported that nerve growth factor treatment decreased AT2 receptor expression in PC12W cells. Kambayashiet al. (31Kambayashi Y. Bardhan S. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 478-482Google Scholar) also reported that the expression of AT2 receptor in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells was down-regulated by the addition of growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor-BB, epidermal growth factor, and endothelin-1. Recently we have reported that this receptor induces apoptosis in PC12W cells by antagonizing the effect of nerve growth factor, and that apoptotic PC12W cells exhibited up-regulated AT2 receptor density (11Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 156-160Google Scholar). Moreover, we demonstrated that Ang II enhanced apoptosis in serum-starved R3T3 cells, along with the increased concentration of the AT2 receptor. These studies suggest that the expression of the AT2 receptor is inversely related to cell growth and is positively correlated with apoptosis. Consistent with our previous reports (11Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 156-160Google Scholar), we also demonstrated in this paper that AT2 receptor induces apoptosis in R3T3 cells; however, the “genetic evidence” that AT2 receptor induces apoptosis still remains to be proved. To examine the molecular mechanism of AT2 receptor up-regulation in apoptosis, we studied R3T3 cells that express very low level of AT2 receptor in the growing state and abundant AT2 receptor after reaching the confluent state (14Dudley D.T. Summerfelt R.M. Regul. Pept. 1993; 44: 199-206Google Scholar). To investigate the growth-regulated AT2receptor expression, we first cloned mouse AT2 receptor genomic DNA and studied its promoter function in R3T3 cells (15Horiuchi M. Koike G. Yamada T. Mukoyama M. Nakajima M. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20225-20230Google Scholar). We identified IRF binding motif (IRF-Es) in the promoter region of AT2 receptor gene and demonstrated that IRF-2 attenuated the AT2 receptor expression in both growing and confluent R3T3 cells, whereas IRF-1 enhanced AT2 receptor expression in the confluent cells only. Consistent with this result, gel mobility shift assay demonstrated that growing R3T3 cells exhibited only IRF-2 binding, whereas confluent cells exhibited both IRF-1 and IRF-2 bindings. In this paper, we demonstrated further that, in confluent R3T3 cells, the removal of serum increased IRF-1 expression but caused a rapid and transient decrease in IRF-2 mRNA expression. These changes of IRFs were associated with an up-regulation of AT2 receptor and the enhancement of AT2 receptor-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that the IRFs play an important role in the up-regulation of this receptor associated with apoptosis. IRF-1 and IRF-2 are structurally related, and they recognize the same DNA sequence elements AAGTGA motif or G(A)AAAG/CT/CGAAAG/CT/C (16Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Google Scholar, 17Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Google Scholar). Gene transfection studies have demonstrated that these two factors are mutually antagonistic; IRF-1 activates transcription, whereas IRF-2 inhibits it (16Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Google Scholar, 19Harada H. Willison K. Sakakibara J. Miyamoto M. Fujita T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1990; 63: 303-312Google Scholar). Harada et al. (23Harada H. Kitagawa M. Tanaka N. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Ishihara M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1993; 259: 971-974Google Scholar) have shown that the IRF-1/IRF-2 expression ratio oscillates throughout the cell cycle of NIH 3T3 cells, with IRF-1 expression at its highest when cells are growth-arrested owing to serum starvation and with IRF-2 being more abundant in growing cells. IRF-1 manifests antiproliferative properties (20Yamada G. Ogawa M. Akagi K. Miyamoto H. Nakano N. Itoh S. Miyazaki J. Nishikawa S. Yamamura K. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 88: 532-536Google Scholar, 22Kirchhoff S. Schaper F. Hauser H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2881-2889Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of the repressor IRF-2 leads to cell transformation and increased tumorigenicity, and this phenotype can be reverted by the concomitant overexpression of IRF-1 (23Harada H. Kitagawa M. Tanaka N. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Ishihara M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1993; 259: 971-974Google Scholar). Accordingly, we speculate further that the changes of IRF-1 and IRF-2 after serum removal are closely linked to the induction of apoptosis in R3T3 cells. Indeed our data demonstrated an increased IRF-1 expression and transiently decreased IRF-2 expression during apoptosis induced by serum removal. Several lines of evidence has shown that the expression of oncogenes can sensitize cells to undergo apoptosis, particularly under conditions of low serum concentration or high cell density (32Evan G.I.

White E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7742-7746Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that IRF-1 and IRF-2 have antioncogenic and oncogenic activities, respectively. Deletion or inactivation of the IRF-1 gene at one or both alleles have been detected in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (34Willman G.L. Sever C.E. Pallavicini M.G. Harada H. Tanaka N. Slovak M.L. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Meeker T.C. List A.F. Taniguchi T. Science. 1993; 259: 968-971Google Scholar). Tanaka et al. (35Tanaka N. Ishihara M. Kitagawa M. Harada H. Kimura T. Matsuyama T. Lamphier M.S. Aizawa S. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1994; 77: 829-839Google Scholar) reported that IRF-1 may be a critical determinant of oncogene-induced cell transformation or apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (EFs). They demonstrated that Ras signaling, under conditions of low serum or at high cell density or following treatment by anticancer drugs or ionizing radiation, induces the death of EFs derived from wild type mice and from mice with a null mutation in the IRF-2 gene (IRF-2−/− mice), but not of EFs from IRF-1−/− and double knockout mice. These data demonstrate that the absence of IRF-1 alone is sufficient to prevent Ras-induced apoptosis. Tamura et al. (36Tamura T. Ishihara M. Lamphier M.S. Tanaka N. Oishi I. Aizawa S. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Taki S. Taniguchi T. Nature. 1995; 376: 596-599Google Scholar) also showed that the mitogen induction of the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme, mammalian homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegance cell death gene ced-3, is IRF-1-dependent. These studies are consistent with our present results and support further that IRF-1 is an unique transcription factor that functions as an apoptotic inducer. IRF-1 and IRF-2 are originally identified as regulators of type I interferon system. DNA sequences recognized by IRFs have been also found in the regulatory regions in a number of interferon-inducible genes (16Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Google Scholar, 17Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Google Scholar, 18Fujita T. Kinura Y. Miyamoto M. Barsoumian E.L.

IRF binding consensus element was also identified in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene promoter region, and IRF-1 is essential for iNOS activation in murine macrophages (40Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Le J. Koh S.I. Kimura T. Green S.J. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J. Science. 1994; 263: 1612-1615Google Scholar). Recently we reported that NO donor molecules,S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine or sodium nitroprusside, induced apoptosis in cultured rabbit vascular smooth muscle cells (41Pallman M. Yamada M. Horiuchi M. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 748-756Google Scholar). In this study, we observed that an increase in the ratio of IRF-1/IRF-2 after serum starvation mediated the up-regulation of AT2 receptor, resulting in the enhancement of Ang II-mediated apoptosis. Our data showed that the blockade of IRF-1 expression resulted in the simultaneous reduction in AT2receptor expression and in apoptosis, whereas blockade of IRF-2 expression led to an increase in AT2 receptor expression and enhanced apoptosis. Taken together these data support the notion that AT2 receptor is one of the target genes of the IRFs system. We propose further that IRF-regulated gene products such AT2 receptor and iNOS may play important mediating roles in IRF-regulated apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W1985335821,"To investigate the function of residues at the catalytic nucleotide binding site of the V-ATPase, we have carried out site-directed mutagenesis of the VMA1 gene encoding the A subunit of the V-ATPase in yeast. Of the three cysteine residues that are conserved in all A subunits sequenced thus far, two (Cys284 and Cys539) appear essential for correct folding or stability of the A subunit. Mutation of the third cysteine (Cys261), located in the glycine-rich loop, to valine, generated an enzyme that was fully active but resistant to inhibition by N-ethylmalemide, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, and oxidation. To test the role of disulfide bond formation in regulation of vacuolar acidificationin vivo, we have also determined the effect of the C261V mutant on targeting and processing of the soluble vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y. No difference in carboxypeptidase Y targeting or processing is observed between the wild type and C261V mutant, suggesting that disulfide bond formation in the V-ATPase A subunit is not essential for controlling vacuolar acidification in the Golgi. In addition, fluid phase endocytosis of Lucifer Yellow, quinacrine staining of acidic intracellular compartments and cell growth are indistinguishable in the C261V and wild type cells.Mutation of G250D in the glycine-rich loop also resulted in destabilization of the A subunit, whereas mutation of the lysine residue in this region (K263Q) gave a V-ATPase complex which showed normal levels of A subunit on the vacuolar membrane but was unstable to detergent solubilization and isolation and was totally lacking in V-ATPase activity. By contrast, mutation of the acidic residue, which has been postulated to play a direct catalytic role in the homologous F-ATPases (E286Q), had no effect on stability or assembly of the V-ATPase complex, but also led to complete loss of V-ATPase activity. The E286Q mutant showed labeling by 2-azido-[32P]ATP that was approximately 60% of that observed for wild type, suggesting that mutation of this glutamic acid residue affected primarily ATP hydrolysis rather than nucleotide binding. To investigate the function of residues at the catalytic nucleotide binding site of the V-ATPase, we have carried out site-directed mutagenesis of the VMA1 gene encoding the A subunit of the V-ATPase in yeast.

Mutation of G250D in the glycine-rich loop also resulted in destabilization of the A subunit, whereas mutation of the lysine residue in this region (K263Q) gave a V-ATPase complex which showed normal levels of A subunit on the vacuolar membrane but was unstable to detergent solubilization and isolation and was totally lacking in V-ATPase activity. By contrast, mutation of the acidic residue, which has been postulated to play a direct catalytic role in the homologous F-ATPases (E286Q), had no effect on stability or assembly of the V-ATPase complex, but also led to complete loss of V-ATPase activity. The E286Q mutant showed labeling by 2-azido-[32P]ATP that was approximately 60% of that observed for wild type, suggesting that mutation of this glutamic acid residue affected primarily ATP hydrolysis rather than nucleotide binding. The vacuolar (H+)-ATPases (or V-ATPases) are a class of ATP-dependent proton pumps that play an important role in a variety of cellular processes, including receptor-mediated endocytosis, intracellular targeting, macromolecular processing and degradation, and coupled transport (1Forgac M.

Acta. 1994; 1187: 165-170Google Scholar), and a recent x-ray crystal structure of the F1 domain has revealed a hexameric arrangement of α and β subunits, with the catalytic sites located primarily on β and the noncatalytic sites located primarily on α (52Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the catalytic nucleotide binding sites of the V-ATPase are located on the A subunit. First, ATP-protectable labeling of the A subunit by agents such as NEM 1The abbreviations used are: NEM,N-ethylmalemide; NBD-Cl, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; CpY, carboxypeptidase Y; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; YPD, yeast extractpeptone-dextrose. and NBD-Cl correlates with inhibition of activity (for references, see (1Forgac M. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 765-796Google Scholar)). Second, modification of a single A subunit cysteine residue (Cys254 of the bovine A subunit) by NEM, cystine, or by disulfide bond formation with Cys532 leads to inactivation of the V-ATPase (38Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Google Scholar, 53Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Google Scholar, 54Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Google Scholar). Third, labeling of the A subunit by the photoaffinity analog 2-azido-[32P]ATP correlates well with inhibition by this reagent (39Zhang J. Vasilyeva E. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15494-15500Google Scholar). Finally, the A subunit, unlike the B subunit, possesses several consensus sequences, including the glycine-rich loop, which appear to be critical for ATP hydrolysis by the homologous F-ATPase β subunit (55Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21471-21478Google Scholar, 56Omote H. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20571-20576Google Scholar, 57Iwamoto A. Park M.Y. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3156-3160Google Scholar). To further probe the structure of the catalytic nucleotide binding sites on the V-ATPase, we have carried out site-directed mutagenesis of the VMA1 gene in yeast. We have focused first on the three highly conserved cysteine residues (Cys261, Cys284, and Cys539), two of which have been postulated to be involved in regulation of V-ATPase activity through disulfide bond formation (53Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Google Scholar, 54Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Google Scholar). We have also tested the effects of mutation of residues in the glycine rich loop region and of an acidic residue which has been postulated to play a direct role in ATP hydrolysis. Zymolyase 100T was obtained from Sekagaku America, Inc. 2-Azido-[32P]ATP labeled in the β and γ positions (58Cross R.L Cunningham D. Miller C.G. Xue Z. Zhou J.M. Boyer P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5715-5719Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Richard Cross, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, SUNY, Syracuse. Concanamycin A was obtained from Fluka, Inc. ATP and most other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Yeast strain SF838-5Aα vma1Δ-8 (MATα, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, ade6, vma1Δ::LEU2) was used for integrations and subsequent biochemical characterization. Yeast cells were grown in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium or supplemented synthetic dextrose medium. Mutagenesis was performed on the wild typeVMA1 gene using the Altered Sites II in vitromutagenesis system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. The full-length VMA1 gene with the spacer region looped out (21Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Wolczyk D.F. Neff N. Goebl M. Stevens T.H. Science. 1990; 250: 651-657Google Scholar) was cloned into pAlter-1 using BamHI andSalI sites. The mutagenesis oligonucleotides were as follows with the substitution sites underlined: G250D, 5′-TCCTTGTGTTCAAGATGGTACGACATG-3′; C261V, 5′-GCTTTTGGTGTTGGTAAGACCG-3′; K263Q, 5′-GGTTGTGGTCAGACCGTTATCTC-3′; C284S, 5′-CTATGTCGGGTCCGGAGAAAG-3′; C284V, 5′-CTATGTCGGGGTCGGAGAAAG-3′; E286Q, 5′-GTCGGGTGCGGACAAAGAGGTAATG-3′; C539D, 5′-GATGCTTTCGATCCAATTTGGAAG-3′; C539S, 5′-GATGCTTTCTCTCCAATTTGGAAG-3′; C539T, 5′-GATGCTTTCACTCCAATTTGGAAG-3′. All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy method (59Sanger F. Niklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) and subcloned into the YIp5 vector using BamHI andSalI sites along with wild type VMA1. No other mutations were detected in the final product. The wild type plasmid (YIp5-VMA1), vma1 mutant plasmids, or YIp5 vector alone were linearized with ApaI to target integration of the constructs to the URA3 locus. Yeast cells (SF838-5Aα vma1Δ-8) were transformed with the linearized plasmids using the lithium acetate method (60Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Google Scholar). The transformants were selected on Ura− plates as described previously (61Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1992Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA was isolated from the transformed yeast cells and the VMA1 gene was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction. The presence of the expected mutations inVMA1 was confirmed by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products. Then the mutants were tested for growth on pH 7.5 or 5.5 YPD plates buffered with 50 mmKH2PO4 and 50 mm succinic acid (62Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.F. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3737-3749Google Scholar). The yeast integrated with wild type plasmid (YIp5-VMA1), mutants, or the vector YIp5 alone (as a negative control) were cultured overnight in 1-liter of YPD (pH 5.5) to log phase. Vacuoles were isolated from the different transformants as described previously (63Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Google Scholar). For purification of the V-ATPase, vacuolar membranes were washed three times with EDTA and solubilized with Zwittergent 3–14, and the V-ATPase was isolated by density gradient sedimentation on 20–50% glycerol gradients as described previously (64Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Google Scholar). The procedures used for growth and metabolic labeling of yeast cells were essentially as described previously (65Klionsky D.J. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3416-3422Google Scholar, 66Leng X.-H. Manolson M.F. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Google Scholar). Cells were grown in yeast nitrogen base medium buffered at pH 5.5 to mid-log phase. Approximately 7 × 107 cells were collected and converted to spheroplasts as described previously (66Leng X.-H. Manolson M.F. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Google Scholar). The spheroplasts were labeled with Tran35S-label (250 μCi) for 20 min at 30 °C and chased for various times in medium containing 8 mm methionine and 4 mm cysteine, and aliquots containing 2 × 107 cells were removed. Samples were separated into intracellular (spheroplast) and extracellular (periplasm plus medium) fractions by centrifugation and then precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Samples were solubilized in buffer containing 1% SDS and 3 m urea, and immunoprecipitations were carried out using an antibody against CpY (the kind gift of Dr. Daniel Klionsky) and protein A-Sepharose as described previously (65Klionsky D.J. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3416-3422Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by heating in Laemmli sample buffer at 75 °C for 8 min followed by SDS-PAGE on an 8% acrylamide gel and autoradiography. ∼5 × 106 log-phase yeast cells were harvested, resuspended in 500 μl of YPD buffered with 50 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 7.6) containing 200 μm quinacrine and incubated at room temperature for 5 min as described previously (63Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Google Scholar). Cells were sedimented at 10,000 ×g for 5 s, washed once with 500 μl of 2% glucose buffered with 50 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.6), and resuspended in 100 μl of the same solution. 10-μl samples were applied to a concanavalin A-coated microscope slide and viewed immediately in the fluorescence microscope using a fluorescein filter. About 5 μg of purified V-ATPase were incubated with 0.3 mm 2-azido-[32P]ATP (100 cpm/pmol) and 5 mm MgSO4 in the absence or presence of 3 mm ATP at 4 °C in the dark for 20 min, followed by irradiation of the sample with a short wavelength mineral light UV lamp at a distance of 2 cm at 4 °C for 20 min. To each sample was added 5 × concentrated Laemmli sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE on a 12% acrylamide gel and autoradiography. Quantitation was done using a PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics). ATPase activity was measured using a coupled spectrophotometric assay in the absence or presence of 0.5 μm concanamycin A (63Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Google Scholar) with the modification of using 0.35 mm NADH instead of 0.5 mm NADH. SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Laemmli (67Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and silver staining was performed by the method of Oakley et al. (68Oakley B.R. Kirsch D.R. Morris N.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 361-363Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by Lowry et al. (69Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) assay. For the measurement of yeast growth curves, overnight yeast cell cultures were diluted into pH 7.5 or 5.5 YPD media buffered with 50 mm KH2PO4 and 50 mmsuccinic acid, and the absorbance at 600 nm was measured starting at a value of 0.5. For immunoblot analysis, whole cell lysates and solubilized vacuoles were prepared as described elsewhere (70Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Google Scholar), subjected to SDS-PAGE, and probed with the mouse monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 against the 69-kDa subunit (Molecular Probes, Inc.), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Blots were developed using a chemiluminescent detection method obtained from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories. Quantitation was carried out using an IS-1000 digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Nine separate mutations have been constructed in theVMA1 gene encoding the yeast A subunit and these mutant genes have been expressed in a vma1Δ strain in which theVMA1 gene has been disrupted. Mutations were constructed in three classes of A subunit residues. First, mutations were made in three highly conserved cysteine residues (Cys261, Cys284, and Cys539), which are located, respectively, in the glycine-rich loop, the GXGER consensus sequence, and the C-terminal domain. Second, mutations were constructed in two other residues (Gly250 and Lys263) postulated to be important on the basis of their location in the glycine-rich loop region. Finally, Glu286 was mutated to test its possible role in catalysis of ATP hydrolysis. Of the mutations tested, only one (C261V) gave a wild type growth phenotype, whereas the remaining mutations (C284S, C284V, C539S, C539T, C539D, G250D, K263Q, and E286Q) all showed the growth phenotype of the deletion strain; that is, they were unable to grow at pH 7.5 but were able to grow at pH 5.5. Comparison of the bafilomycin-sensitive ATPase activity in vacuoles isolated from the wild-type, mutant, and deletion strains revealed that all of the mutations except the C261V mutation resulted in complete loss of functional V-ATPase activity. The specific activity of the C261V mutant (1.06 ± 0.10 μmol of ATP/min/mg of protein) was indistinguishable from the wild type control (0.98 ± 0.08 μmol of ATP/min/mg of protein). To determine the basis for the observed loss in V-ATPase activity for the remaining eight mutations, Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody specific for the A subunit was performed on both whole cell homogenates and isolated vacuoles. The presence of the A subunit on the vacuolar membrane provides an initial measure of the competence of the mutant protein to support assembly of the V-ATPase complex. As can be seen in Fig. 1, mutations in the remaining two conserved cysteine residues (C284S, C284V, C539S, C539T, and C539D) led to the absence of a detectable signal in whole cell homogenates, suggesting that these mutations resulted in a loss of stability of the A subunit. Alternatively, one of these mutations may have disrupted the epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody (8B1-F3). As a further test, Western blot analysis on whole cell homogenates was also carried out using a second monoclonal antibody (7D5) directed against the A subunit. As with the antibody 8B1-F3, no immunoreactive band was observed for any of the C284 or C539 mutants (data not shown). While these results are not conclusive because the epitopes recognized by these antibodies have not been mapped, they suggest that mutations at these two cysteine residues lead to destabilization of the A subunit. By contrast, C261V, E286Q, and K263Q gave nearly normal levels of A subunit in the cell homogenate, and the former two mutations showed normal association of the A subunit with the vacuolar membrane. Quantitation of the Western blot in Fig. 1 B by densitometry indicates that the K263Q mutation resulted in a 10% decrease in the amount of A subunit associated with the vacuole. The G250D mutation resulted in a 60% decrease in the amount of A subunit in whole cells and the complete loss of V-ATPase assembly on the vacuolar membrane. As a further test for assembly and stability of the V-ATPase complex, vacuolar membranes were solubilized with Zwittergent 3–14, and the V-ATPase was isolated by density gradient sedimentation as described previously (64Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 2, normal assembly of the V-ATPase as assessed by the presence of the complete complement of V-ATPase subunits in the purified enzyme was observed for both the C261V and E286Q mutants. The K263Q mutant, despite the presence of 90% of the wild type level of A subunit on the vacuolar membrane (Fig. 1 B), showed greatly reduced levels of assembly, suggesting that the K263Q mutation leads to reduced stability of the V-ATPase. None of the remaining mutants showed any detectable levels of stable V-ATPase complex. Because the C261V mutant showed wild type levels of V-ATPase activity, we proceeded to further characterize this mutant. We have previously suggested that Cys254 of the bovine V-ATPase A subunit (corresponding to Cys261 in yeast) is the residue responsible for sensitivity of the V-ATPases to sulfhydryl reagents, such as NEM (38Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Google Scholar). Moreover, we have suggested that disulfide bond formation between Cys254 and Cys532(corresponding to Cys539 in yeast) leads to reversible inhibition of V-ATPase activity (53Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Google Scholar, 54Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Google Scholar). To test these hypotheses, we have tested the sensitivity of the C261V mutant to both NEM and oxidation. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the C261V mutant is both more resistant to inhibition by NEM and more resistant to oxidation by hydrogen peroxide. In addition, this mutant is also more resistant to inhibition by NBD-Cl. NBD-Cl is an ATP protectable inhibitor of the V-ATPases (71Arai H. Berne M. Terres G. Terres H. Puopolo K. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6632-6638Google Scholar) that is capable of reacting reversibly with tyrosine and cysteine residues or irreversibly with lysine residues (72Andrews W.W. Hill F.C. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14378-14382Google Scholar). The observed resistance of the C261V mutant to inhibition by NBD-Cl suggests that Cys261 may be the site of inhibition of the V-ATPases by this reagent. We have also suggested that disulfide bond formation between Cys254 and Cys532 may play a role in regulation of V-ATPase activity in vivo (53Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Google Scholar, 54Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Google Scholar). Because correct targeting and processing of the soluble vacuolar protein CpY is partially disrupted in vma mutants (65Klionsky D.J. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3416-3422Google Scholar, 73Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.F. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3737-3749Google Scholar), a role of vacuolar acidification in intracellular targeting in yeast has been suggested. We therefore tested the effect of the C261V mutation, which should block formation of the inhibitory disulfide bond and therefore lead to a constitutively active V-ATPase, on targeting and processing of CpY. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the time course for processing of the precursor of CpY to the mature form and the fraction of immature CpY secreted into the media is indistinguishable in the wild type and C261V mutant, whereas a marked reduction in processing is observed in the deletion strain. The fact that some CpY is secreted even in wild type cells is most likely due to the lower V-ATPase activity observed in the vacuoles isolated from vma1Δ cells containing an integrated copy of the wild type A subunit gene at the URA3 locus relative to the parental VMA1 strain. Thus disulfide bond formation in the A subunit does not appear to be required for correct targeting and processing of CpY. We have compared three additional parameters in the wild type and the C261V mutant cells staining with the fluorescent weak base quinacrine, fluid phase endocytosis of Lucifer Yellow, and growth at neutral and acidic pH. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the intensity and pattern of staining observed with quinacrine, which labels acidic intracellular compartments, was markedly reduced in the deletion strain but indistinguishable in the wild type and C261V mutants. Similarly, although the deletion strain showed a marke"

Shimizu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 317-333Google Scholar). PAF mediates its effects via the activation of a seven transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor (2Honda Z. Nakamura M. Miki I. Minami M. Watanabe T. Seyama Y. Okado H. Toh H. Ito K. Miyamoto T. Shimizu T. Nature. 1991; 349: 342-346Google Scholar, 3Kunz D. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9101-9106Google Scholar). One of the consequences of PAF receptor activation is the phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate leading to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ (4Verghese M.W. Charles L. Jakoi L. Dillon S.B. Snyderman R. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 4374-4380Google Scholar). Molecular cloning has revealed three classes of PLC: PLCβ, PLCγ, and PLCδ, and each of these occur in several isoforms (5Rhee S.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 297-301Google Scholar, 6Lee C.W. Park D.J. Lee K.H. Kim C.G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21318-21327Google Scholar). All four PLC β isoforms are activated to varying extent by α subunit of a class of G proteins known as Gq (7Wu D. Katz A. Lee C.H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25798-25802Google Scholar, 8Park D. Jhon D.Y. Lee C.W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Google Scholar, 9Jhon D.Y. Lee H.H. Park D. Lee C.W. Lee K.H. Yoo O.J.

PLCβ2 and PLCβ3 are also activated by the βγ subunit of the Gi family of G proteins (11Camps M. Carozzi A. Schnabel P. Scheer A. Parker P.J. Gierschik P.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ is required for its activation, but the mechanism by which PLCδ is activated is unknown (5Rhee S.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 297-301Google Scholar). PAFR couples to both pertussis toxin (Ptx)-sensitive and Ptx-insensitive G proteins in a variety of cells (4Verghese M.W. Charles L. Jakoi L. Dillon S.B. Snyderman R. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 4374-4380Google Scholar, 14Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Google Scholar, 15Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Google Scholar). In B cells and platelets, PAF activates PLCγ (16Kuruvilla A. Pielop C. Shearer W.T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5433-5442Google Scholar, 17Dhar A. Shukla S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9123-9127Google Scholar), but the identity of PLCs activated by PAF in phagocytic leukocytes is unknown. In phagocytes, PAF-stimulated G protein activation and Ca2+mobilization are desensitized by prior treatment of cells with PAF and other chemoattractants such as the formylated peptides, C5a and interleukin-8 (18Tomhave E.D. Richardson R.M. Didsbury J.R. Menard L. Snyderman R. Ali H. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3267-3275Google Scholar).

Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28717-28724Google Scholar). Using wild type and phosphorylation-deficient PAFR expressed in this cell line, we now describe the novel finding that homologous desensitization of PAF-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+mobilization is mediated via two processes; one at the level of receptor phosphorylation and the other at the level of PLC activation apparently by PKC-dependent phosphorylation of PLCβ3. Bisindolylmaleimide or GF 109203X (BIM), 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3′-cyclic monophosphate (Cpt-cAMP) and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP1 were purchased from Calbiochem. Affinity purified polyclonal antibodies against PLCβ1, PLCβ2, and PLCβ3 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. ECL Western blot analysis kit was purchased from Amersham Corp. Mouse monoclonal IgE and antigen (dinitrophenylated BSA) were generously provided by Drs. Juan Rivera and Henry Metzger (National Institutes of Health). All other materials were obtained from sources previously described (15Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing ∼3 × 104 receptors for PAFR and mPAFR were used (21Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28717-28724Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) (19Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Google Scholar). For phosphoinositide hydrolysis, cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were subcultured overnight in 96-well tissue culture plate with 1 μCi/ml of [3H]inositol in an inositol-free medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were washed with HEPES-buffered saline containing 10 mm LiCl and 0.1% BSA and stimulated, and the generation of total [3H]inositol phosphates was determined. For Ca2+ mobilization, cells (3 × 106) were loaded with 1 μm indo-1/AM in the presence of 1 μm pluoronic acid for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and resuspended in 1.5 ml HEPES-buffered saline, and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was determined as described previously (19Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Google Scholar). For Western blotting, lysate (150 μg protein) from RBL-2H3 cells, and for comparison, lysates from bovine brain, COS cells, and HL-60 cells were resolved on a 6% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 3% milk, and incubated with 1.5 μg/ml of different anti-PLCβ antibodies. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using ECL Western blotting detection system. Phosphorylation of PLCβ3 was performed essentially as described for the epitope-tagged chemoattractant receptors (19Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Google Scholar). Briefly, RBL-2H3 cells (3 × 106) were subcultured overnight in 60-mm tissue culture dishes. The following day, cells were washed twice with 5 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in the same medium plus [32P]orthophosphate (150 μCi/dish) for 90 min. The labeled cells were stimulated, and PLCβ3 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysate with anti-PLCβ3 antibody. The proteins were resolved on a 6% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by autoradiography. The mechanism of PAF receptor desensitization was studied using the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells expressing wild type PAFR and a mPAFR in which the cytoplasmic tail was truncated to delete potential phosphorylation sites (21Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28717-28724Google Scholar). In contrast to PAFR, mPAFR was resistant to both ligand and PKC-induced receptor phosphorylation and desensitization of G protein coupling, as measured by [35S]GTPγS binding to membranes (21Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28717-28724Google Scholar, 22Takano T. Honda Z. Sakanaka C. Izumi T. Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Kurokawa K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22453-22458Google Scholar). However, when indo-1-loaded cells expressing mPAFR were stimulated with PAF (10 nm), washed, and restimulated with PAF (10 nm), the peak Ca2+ response was still homologously desensitized by ∼50% (Table I). PMA also inhibited mPAFR-mediated Ca2+ mobilization by ∼50%, suggesting a locus of inhibition distal to G protein activation. In cells expressing wild type PAFR, both PAF and PMA inhibited PAF-induced Ca2+mobilization by >90%. PMA also caused substantial inhibition of mPAF-induced generation of inositol phosphates and completely blocked the response to PAF (Fig. 1). To further test the role of PKC on PAFR desensitization, cells expressing mPAFR and PAFR were treated with PMA (100 nm) overnight to deplete PKC or incubated with the PKC-inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide for 10 min to block the activity of the enzyme. PAF-stimulated generation of inositol phosphates was then determined. Under both of these conditions, PAF-induced responses were enhanced 2–3-fold in cells expressing mPAFR (Fig. 1). Overnight PMA treatment did not enhance the response to PAF in cells expressing PAFR, but bisindolylmaleimide did potentiate the response to PAF. Because PMA-induced PKC depletion involves activation of the enzyme, it was possible that the differential effect of PMA on mPAFR and PAFR cells resulted from PKC-induced phosphorylation and down-regulation of PAFR but not mPAFR. Indeed, treatment of cells with PMA (100 nm, overnight) resulted in ∼50% decrease of the wild type PAFR expression but had no effect on mPAFR as measured by the PAFR antagonist [3H]WEB 2086 binding to intact cells (data not shown). These data suggest that homologous desensitization of PAF-mediated cellular responses is mediated by two processes. One involves receptor phosphorylation, presumably by PKC and a G protein-coupled receptor kinase, which uncouple the receptor from G proteins (21Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28717-28724Google Scholar). In addition, a new mechanism was identified as a consequence of PKC-induced modification of a component distal to G protein activation but proximal to the generation of inositol phosphates.Table IDesensitization of PAF-mediated Ca2+ mobilizationCells/treatmentCa2+ mobilizationDesensitizationnm%mPAFRPAF → PAF517 ± 15 → 240 ± 1953PMA → PAF0 ± 0 → 264 ± 1251PAFRPAF → PAF617 ± 40 → 48 ± 492PMA → PAF0 ± 0 → 43 ± 593RBL-2H3 cells (3 × 106) expressing mPAFR or PAFR were loaded with indo-1 and stimulated with PAF (10 nm), and peak Ca2+ mobilization was determined as described (19Ali H.

Although most G protein-coupled receptors activate PLCβ, angiotensin receptors in smooth muscle cells and PAF receptors in B cells and platelets cause tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLCγ (16Kuruvilla A. Pielop C. Shearer W.T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5433-5442Google Scholar,17Dhar A. Shukla S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9123-9127Google Scholar, 23Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Schieffer E. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15734-15738Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which G protein-coupled receptors activate PLCγ has yet to be determined. PMA, which causes serine phosphorylation of PLCγ (24Park D.J. Min H.K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1496-1501Google Scholar), leads to reduction of both tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ and generation of inositol phosphates stimulated by cross-linking of cell surface IgE receptors with antigen (25Kim U.H. Kim J.W. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20167-20170Google Scholar, 26Ozawa K. Yamada K. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2280-2283Google Scholar). This suggests that if PAF activates PLCγ, a similar modification of PLCγ by PKC could be involved in its homologous desensitization. However, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP1 (27Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok K. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 71: 695-701Google Scholar), which blocked antigen (IgE)-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization by >70%, presumably by inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ, had no effect on PAF-mediated responses (Table II). Elevation of intracellular cAMP has also been shown to cause serine phosphorylation of PLCγ and inhibition of antigen-stimulated responses (24Park D.J. Min H.K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1496-1501Google Scholar). As shown in Table II, the membrane permeable cAMP analog 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3′-cylic monophosphate (cpt-cAMP) substantially inhibited IgE-mediated Ca2+mobilization but had no effect on the PAF-mediated response. These data suggest that unlike B cells and platelets (16Kuruvilla A. Pielop C. Shearer W.T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5433-5442Google Scholar, 17Dhar A. Shukla S.D. J. Biol.

We therefore sought to determine whether a PLCβ isoform is activated by PAF in RBL-2H3 cells. To identify the PLCβ isoforms expressed in RBL-2H3 cells, their lysates and lysates from bovine brain, COS and HL-60 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of PLCβ1, PLCβ2, and PLCβ3 was determined by Western blotting using PLCβ isoform-specific antibodies. All cells tested, including RBL-2H3 cells, expressed PLCβ3 in different amounts (Fig. 2). Although PLCβ1 and PLCβ2 were expressed at high levels in brain and HL-60 cells, respectively, neither could be detected in RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 2). Studies with purified G proteins and PLC revealed that PLCβ1 and PLCβ3 are equally responsive to activation by Gαq (28Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Google Scholar). It was therefore possible that in RBL-2H3 cells, which do not express PLCβ1, PAF activates PLCβ3 and that PKC-induced modification of this enzyme accounts for the distal component of PAFR homologous desensitization. To test this hypothesis, cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with PAF, and cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with PLCβ3-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), PAF caused phosphorylation of PLCβ3 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. PLCβ3 phosphorylation was detectable at physiologic PAF concentration of 0.3 nm and was maximum by 10 nm. PAF-induced PLCβ3 phosphorylation was rapid, reached a maximum by 15 s, and remained elevated for 10 min. To determine whether there was a correlation between PKC-mediated PLCβ3 phosphorylation and inhibition of PAF-stimulated responses, cells were treated with or without the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide, stimulated with PAF (10 nm) and PMA (100 nm), and PLCβ3 phosphorylation was determined. As shown in Fig.3 C, PAF- and PMA-induced PLCβ3 phosphorylation was almost completely inhibited by bisindolylmaleimide. Cpt-cAMP also phosphorylated PLCβ3 presumably through activation of PKA, and this phosphorylation was not inhibited by bisindolylmaleimide. PLCβ3 phosphorylation was also tested in two other cell lines that endogenously express PAF receptors. These were the human monocyte-like U937 cells and the murine macrophage-like J774.1 cells. In both cases, PAF, PMA, and cpt-cAMP stimulated phosphorylation of PLCβ3 (Fig.3 D). The effect of cAMP elevation on PLC activation was determined using the RBL-2H3 cells coexpressing PAF and formylpeptide receptors. In such cells, cpt-cAMP did not inhibit Ca2+ mobilization to PAF, although it did inhibit the response of the formylpeptide receptor (Table II). Furthermore, in cells expressing mPAFR, cpt-cAMP (1 mm, 5 min) had no effect on PAF-stimulated generation of [3H]inositol phosphates, whereas PMA (100 nm, 5 min) blocked this response by ∼50%. Preincubation of cells with cpt-cAMP had no effect on PMA-mediated inhibition of PAF-stimulated response (data not shown). These data support the hypothesis that PLCβ3 is likely activated by PAFR and that PLCβ3 phosphorylation by PKC, but not by PKA, is responsible for one component of PAFR homologous desensitization. PLCβ1 is phosphorylated by PKC (29Ryu S.H. Kim U.H. Wahl M.I. Brown A.B. Carpenter G. Huang K.P. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17941-17945Google Scholar), and PLCβ2 is phosphorylated by PKA (30Liu M.Y. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Google Scholar). The present study revealed that both PKC and PKA phosphorylate of PLCβ3 in vivo (Fig. 3 C). More importantly, phosphorylation of PLCβ3 by the different protein kinases appears to be associated with distinct functional consequences. Although phosphorylation of PLCβ3 by PKC resulted in the inhibition of responses stimulated by PAF, its phosphorylation by PKA was not associated with such inhibition. On the other hand, PKA activation by cpt-cAMP inhibited formylpeptide receptor-mediated responses. In RBL-2H3 cells PAF receptors activate PLC predominantly via a Ptx-insensitive G protein, whereas formylpeptide-mediated response is completely blocked by Ptx (15Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Google Scholar, 19Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Google Scholar). Therefore, differential inhibition of responses to PAF and formylpeptide by PKC and PKA is likely due to the different G protein subunits these receptors utilize to activate PLC. It was demonstrated in vitro that Gαq and Gβγ released from Ptx-sensitive G protein interact with distinct regions of PLCβ3 to activate the enzyme (28Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Google Scholar). This led Smrcka and Sternweis to propose that different receptors that utilize Gq or Gi could activate PLCβ3 by producing Gαq or Gβγ (28Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Google Scholar). The data presented herein support this hypothesis and provide a molecular basis for the differential regulation of Gαq- and Gβγ-mediated activation of PLCβ3. It is likely that PKC and PKA phosphorylate PLCβ3 on distinct sites that block its activation by Gαq and Gβγ, respectively. Similar to RBL-2H3 cells, many human cell lines and tissues express PLCβ3 but not PLCβ1 or PLCβ2 (9Jhon D.Y. Lee H.H. Park D. Lee C.W. Lee K.H. Yoo O.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Given the duality of PLCβ3 activation by both Gαq and Gβγ and its ubiquitous tissue distribution, phosphorylation of PLCβ3 by PKC and PKA may be general mechanisms by which functions of different G protein/PLC-coupled receptors are regulated.

https://openalex.org/W1987498748,"The roles of conserved residues in transmembrane helices (TMs) of G protein-coupled receptors have not been well established. A computer-generated model of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRH-R) indicated that conserved Asp-71 (TM-2) could interact with conserved asparagines 316 (TM-7) and 43 (TM-1). To test this model, we constructed mutant TRH-Rs containing polar or alanine substitutions of these residues. The maximal activities of N43A and N316A TRH-Rs were diminished, whereas D71A (Perlman, J. H., Nussenzveig, D. R., Osman, R., and Gershengorn, M. C. (1992)J. Biol. Chem. 267, 24413–24417) and N43A/N316A TRH-Rs were inactive. Computer models of D71A and N43A/N316A TRH-Rs show similar changes from native TRH-R in their TM bundle conformations. The inactivity and the similarity of the computer models of D71A and N43A/N316A TRH-Rs are consistent with the idea that Asp-71 bridges Asn-43 and Asn-316 and suggest that activity is critically dependent on these interactions.

(1Straub R.E. Frech G.C. Joho R.H. Gershengorn M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9514-9518Google Scholar) is a member of the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic receptor subfamily of GPCRs (2Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Google Scholar). It is thought that all GPCRs have in common a transmembrane bundle that is composed of seven helices. It has been proposed that residues that are highly conserved in these helices are important in maintaining the structure of the bundle and thereby producing a receptor that exhibits high affinity and activity (3Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Google Scholar, 4Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Google Scholar). Bacteriorhodopsin is the only protein that contains seven transmembrane-spanning helices (TMs) for which a crystallographic analysis at an atomic level of resolution is available (5Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckmann E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Google Scholar). However, bacteriorhodopsin is not a GPCR and does not share sequence homology with GPCRs. Baldwin (3Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Google Scholar) predicted a structure for GPCRs of the β-adrenergic/rhodopsin family in which the TMs are arranged in a counterclockwise bundle (as viewed from the extracellular surface) based on sequence homology, conservation, and polarity of residues. A recently reported two-dimensional projection map of rhodopsin is consistent with this structure (6Schertler G.F.X. Hargrave P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11578-11582Google Scholar). The resolution of the projection map was not sufficiently high, however, to allow assignment of specific helical positions and could not identify residues that form interhelical interactions. Indirect evidence, therefore, has been used to suggest proximity of TMs 2, 3, and 7 in rhodopsin (7Rao V.R. Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Nature. 1994; 367: 639-642Google Scholar), of TMs 1, 2, 3, and 6 to TM-7 in adrenergic receptors (8Suryanarayana S. Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21991-21994Google Scholar, 9Mizobe T. Maze M. Lam V. Suryanarayana S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2387-2389Google Scholar), of TMs 1 and 7 (10Liu J. Schöneberg T. van Rhee M. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19532-19539Google Scholar) in muscarinic receptors, and of TMs 5 and 6 of the neurokinin NK-1 receptor (11Gether U. Nilsson L. Lowe III, J.A. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23959-23964Google Scholar). Proximity of two of the three highly conserved residues, Asn in TM-1, Asp in TM-2, and Asn in TM-7, has been suggested for several GPCRs by demonstrations that single substitutions of Asp by Asn or of Asn by Asp lead to diminished receptor function and double substitutions restore function. For example, an interaction has been suggested between Asp of TM-2 and Asn of TM-7 in the serotonin 5HT2A receptor (12Sealfon S.C. Chi L. Ebersole B.J. Rodic V. Zhang D. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16683-16688Google Scholar). Interestingly, the positions of Asp and Asn residues are switched in the GnRH receptor, which contains an Asn in TM-2 and an Asp in TM-7, and these residues were suggested to interact (13Zhou W. Flanagan C. Ballesteros J.A. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170Google Scholar). Recently, it was suggested that Asn in TM-1, Asp in TM-2, and Asn (and a conserved Tyr) in TM-7 are near each other and form a polar pocket within the α1B-adrenergic receptor (14Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Google Scholar). We have constructed a model of the complex of TRH and TRH-R (15Perlman J.H. Laakkonen L.J. Guarnieri F. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7643-7650Google Scholar, 16Laakkonen L. Guarnieri F. Perlman J.H. Gershengorn M.C. Osman R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7651-7663Google Scholar) based on a GPCR template that is different from that of bacteriorhodopsin. The model of the TRH·TRH-R complex predicts proximity of Asn 43 in TM-1, Asp 71 in TM-2, and Asn 316 in TM-7 of TRH-R. The putative binding pocket for TRH is between TMs 3, 6, and 7 and is not close to the region occupied by Asn-43, Asp-71, and Asn-316. In this study, we have examined the roles of Asn-43, Asp-71, and Asn-316 of TRH-R. We present experimental and computational evidence that Asp-71 interacts with Asn-43 and Asn-316. Our data indicate that these interactions are critical for activation of TRH-R and provide support for the proposed TM bundle topology of GPCRs. [3H]MeTRH was obtained from DuPont.myo-[3H]Inositol was obtained from Amersham Corp. TRH was from Calbiochem and MeTRH from Sigma. Restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs. The cloning vector pBluescript was from Stratagene and the expression vector pCDM8 from Invitrogen. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum were from Collaborative Research. The full-length, mouse TRH-R cDNA in pBluescript (pBSmTRHR) (1Straub R.E. Frech G.C. Joho R.H. Gershengorn M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9514-9518Google Scholar) or pCDM8 (pCDM8mTRHR) (17Gershengorn M.C. Thaw C.N. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1204-1206Google Scholar) was used for mutation. Mutants were prepared by the polymerase chain reaction and were subcloned directly into pCDM8mTRHR (N43A, N43D, and D71N) or were subcloned into pBSmTRHR (N316A and N316D) and then subcloned into pCDM8mTRHR after digesting with XhoI and NotI. Double mutants were constructed in pCDM8. Construction of D71A TRH-R was described previously (18Perlman J.H. Nussenzveig D.R. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24413-24417Google Scholar). Mutant TRH-R sequences were confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method. COS-1 cells were maintained and transfected as described previously (1Straub R.E. Frech G.C. Joho R.H. Gershengorn M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9514-9518Google Scholar). In brief, cells were seeded 1 or 2 days prior to transfection at 0.7 to 1.5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish. Cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method as described and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum for 1 day at which time cells were harvested and seeded into 12-well plates at 100,000 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum. One day after reseeding into 12-well plates, binding experiments were carried out in buffer with cells in monolayer for 1 h at 37 °C as described elsewhere (18Perlman J.H. Nussenzveig D.R. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24413-24417Google Scholar). Inhibitory constants (K i) were derived from competition binding experiments for which curves were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis and drawn with the PRISM program (GraphPad Inc.). One day after transfection, cells in monolayer in 12-well plates were labeled with 1 μCi ofmyo-[3H]inositol/ml. Stimulation of IP formation was measured 1 day later for 1 h at 37 °C by methods previously described (19Perlman J.H. Laakkonen L. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23383-23386Google Scholar). None of the TRH-Rs studied stimulated IP formation in the absence of TRH. Maximal activity of a mutant TRH-R was defined as the ratio of IPs formed in response to maximally effective concentrations of TRH in cells expressing a mutant TRH-R compared with WT. The maximal activity of WT TRH-R was set at 100%. Maximal activity was assessed only for those mutant receptors which were shown to be expressed at levels that for WT TRH-Rs were sufficient for maximal activity. We have previously constructed models of the TRH·TRH-R complex using energy minimization techniques (15Perlman J.H. Laakkonen L.J. Guarnieri F. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7643-7650Google Scholar) and novel mixed mode Monte Carlo/Stochastic Dynamics simulations (16Laakkonen L. Guarnieri F. Perlman J.H. Gershengorn M.C. Osman R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7651-7663Google Scholar). The first approach produced an initial model of the binding pocket that was later refined through the Monte Carlo/Stochastic Dynamics simulations. These models agree with experimental findings. We have now constructed a model of TRH-R that includes the ECLs. The ECLs were added to a previously constructed model of the TM domain of TRH-R (16Laakkonen L. Guarnieri F. Perlman J.H. Gershengorn M.C. Osman R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7651-7663Google Scholar). The disulfide bridge between Cys residues in ECL-1 and ECL-2, which has been shown to be necessary to constrain TRH-R in a high affinity conformation (20Perlman J.H. Wang W. Nussenzveig D.R. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24682-24685Google Scholar), was maintained throughout all simulations. The model with frozen helices was energy-minimized with the program CHARMM (21Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Google Scholar) and used to generate 14 energy-minimized average structures through a simulated annealing protocol (22Kirkpatrick S. Gelatt Jr., C.D. Vecchi M.P. Science. 1983; 220: 671-680Google Scholar). The details of these simulations will be presented in a separate report. 2A.-O. Colson, J. H. Perlman, A. Smolyer, M. C. Gershengorn, and R. Osman, manuscript in preparation. In brief, the minimized structure was heated to 1500 K, and 14 initial structures were extracted from a trajectory at this temperature. Each of these structures was annealed to 300 K over 60 ps followed by 100 ps constant temperature simulation at 300 K. The resulting minimized average structures clustered according to their pairwise root-mean square deviation (rmsd), producing a major family of seven members at rmsd of 1.9 Å. One of these structures was retained and used to conduct a simulation of the receptor-TRH complex. TRH was manually placed in the binding pocket as described previously (16Laakkonen L. Guarnieri F. Perlman J.H. Gershengorn M.C. Osman R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7651-7663Google Scholar). All helical constraints were removed, and the complex was energy-minimized, heated to 300 K in 23 ps, and subjected to 1 ns of molecular dynamics simulation at 300 K. An average structure calculated from the last 600 ps of the trajectory was energy-minimized in preparation for the construction of the structures described below. To test the relationship among Asn-43, Asp-71, and Asn 316, NMR nuclear Overhauser effect distance constraints as encoded in CHARMM (K max = 20 kJ/mol/Å2,K min = 40 kJ/mol/Å2,r min = 1.5 Å, r max = 2.0 Å) were applied during a 2000-step minimization to induce the formation of hydrogen bonds between the three residues. Subsequently, the constraints were removed, and the structure was further minimized for 3000 steps. Only the Asn-43–Asp-71 and Asp-71–Asn-316 hydrogen bonds remained in the unconstrained structure. Several minimizations were attempted with other constraints which were later removed, to explore alternative hydrogen bonding among the three residues. The only stable hydrogen bonding pattern was Asn-43–Asp-71 and Asp-71–Asn-316. This structure was subsequently heated to 300 K and subjected to 200 ps of molecular dynamics simulation at 300 K. It was also used in preparing the four mutant receptors, i.e. N43A, D71A, N316A, and N43A/N316A TRH-Rs. Each mutant was constructed by substituting Ala for Asn or Asp and energy-minimized for 2000 steps. Subsequently, each structure was heated to 300 K and subjected to 200 ps of molecular dynamics simulation at 300 K. The energy minimized structures averaged over 100–140 ps of the corresponding simulations are presented here. In all calculations, a distant dependent dielectric function was used to approximate the effect of the environment. Our revised model of the TRH·WT TRH-R complex indicates proximity of conserved residues Asn-43 in TM-1, Asp-71 in TM-2, and Asn-316 in TM-7. This model does not differ significantly in the TM bundle binding pocket from that described in our previous publication (16Laakkonen L. Guarnieri F. Perlman J.H. Gershengorn M.C. Osman R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7651-7663Google Scholar) but includes a newly constructed domain consisting of the three ECLs. 3Atomic coordinates of this model can be obtained by contacting Roman Osman at the following E-mail address:[email protected] A closeup of domains including TM-1, TM-2, and TM-7 (Fig. 1) indicates that Asp-71 forms hydrogen bonds to both Asn-43 and Asn-316. On the other hand, no interaction between Asn-43 and Asn-316 could be maintained in the simulations, suggesting that these residues are involved in maintaining receptor structure through their common bridge to Asp-71. To begin to assess the roles of Asn-43, Asp-71, and Asn-316, substitutions were made with Asp, Asn, and Asp, respectively. The results of binding and activation studies of WT and mutant TRH-Rs transiently expressed in COS-1 cells are shown in Table I. The affinities of N43D and D71N were 8- and 57-fold lower than WT TRH-R, respectively, and the affinity of N316D TRH-R was 6-fold higher than WT TRH-R. These changes in affinities are small compared with substitution of residues that we have shown directly contact TRH. These data are consistent with the model which predicts that these residues do not directly contact TRH and that the changes in affinities are secondary to conformational changes in the TM bundle (see below). N43D, D71N, and N316D TRH-Rs exhibited 57, 52, and 98% of WT TRH-R maximal activity, respectively. Thus, N43D and D71N TRH-Rs exhibited lower maximal activities than WT TRH-R, whereas N316D was as active as WT TRH-R.Table IEffects of substitution of Asn-43 by Asp, Asp-71 by Asn, and Asn-316 by Asp in single and double mutantsTRH-RK d1-aK d for MeTRH.B max/wellEC501-bEC50 for TRH.Maximal activitynmdpm × 10 −3nm% WTWT2.8200.59100(2.1–3.6)(±1.8)(0.51–0.69)(n = 21)(n = 41)(n = 19)N43D214.51957(18–24)(±0.65)(17–22)(±3.5)(n = 6)(n = 25)(n = 8)(n = 19)D71N1604754052(140–180)(±8.0)(430–680)(±5.8)(n = 8)(n = 14)(n = 2)(n = 10)N316D0.465.70.8798(0.1–1.0)(±0.79)(0.66–1.2)(±6.1)(n = 5)(n = 10)(n = 3)(n = 6)D71N/N316D33010250115(250–420)(±1.6)(200–310)(±13)(n = 5)(n = 11)(n = 3)(n = 8)N43D/N316DNSB1-cNo specific binding measurable.91—1-dActivity at maximally effective concentrations of TRH (up to 1 mm) was measured as 15% but B maxcould not be determined.(71–120)(n = 7)N43D/D71N30022—1-eMaximal activity too low to assess EC50.7.6(250–390)(±2.4)(±1.2)(n = 10)(n = 17)(n = 16)1-a K d for MeTRH.1-b EC50 for TRH.1-c No specific binding measurable.1-d Activity at maximally effective concentrations of TRH (up to 1 mm) was measured as 15% but B maxcould not be determined.1-e Maximal activity too low to assess EC50.

The maximal activities of N43D/D71N and D71N/N316D TRH-Rs were 7.6 and 115% that of WT TRH-R, respectively. The maximal activity of N43D/N316D could not be determined because the B max could not be measured. Thus, the mutant receptor containing Asn at position 71 was made to revert to WT TRH-R levels of activity by substituting Asp at position 316. This suggests that positions 71 and 316 are proximate and that an interaction between Asp-71 and Asn-316 occurs in WT TRH-R that is important for activation. We cannot determine whether the loss in activity of the double mutant N43D/D71N TRH-R was additive, which would suggest that these two residues were functionally independent, or more than additive, which would be consistent with these residues being functionally interdependent, compared with the two receptors with single mutations. Therefore, it is not clear from these data whether Asn-43 and Asp-71 are proximate (see below). As we could not determine the activity of N43D/N316D TRH-R, we could not assess whether Asn-43 and Asn-316 are functionally interdependent from these data also (see below). To analyze our model further, alanine residues, which would minimize the possibility of introducing non-native interactions, were substituted at Asn-43, Asp-71, and Asn-316 (Table II). The affinity of N43A TRH-R was similar to WT TRH-R, and the affinities of D71A and N316A TRH-Rs were 3- and 11-fold lower, respectively, than WT TRH-R. The maximal activities of N43A and N316A TRH-Rs were 37 and 47% of WT TRH-R, respectively; D71A TRH-R was inactive. These data indicate that Asn-43, Asp-71, and Asn-316 are important for activation of TRH-R. The larger effect noted with D71A TRH-R compared with either N43A or N316A TRH-Rs is consistent with the idea that Asp-71 interacts with both Asn-43 and Asn-316. To further test this prediction, the double mutant N43A/N316A TRH-R was constructed. The affinity of N43A/N316A TRH-R was 22-fold lower than WT. More importantly, N43A/N316A TRH-R was inactive. Thus, both D71A and N43A/N316A TRH-Rs are inactive receptors. These data are consistent with our model in which Asp-71 interacts with both Asn-43 and Asn-316.Table IIEffects of substitution of Asn 43, Asp 71 and Asn 316 by AlaTRH-RK d2-aK d for MeTRH.B max/wellEC502-bEC50 for TRH.Maximal activitynmdpm × 10 −3nm% WTWT2.8200.59100(2.1–3.6)(±1.8)(0.51–0.69)(n = 21)(n = 41)(n = 19)N43A3.12.83.237(2.0–4.4)(±0.37)(2.2–4.6)(±4.3)(n = 5)(n = 10)(n = 4)(n = 14)D71A8.62-cData are from Perlman et al.

Open table in a new tab In our model of WT TRH-R, Asn-316 plays an important role in addition to hydrogen bonding to Asp-71. An averaged minimized structure from the simulation shows that the hydrogen bond to Asp-71 orients the amide group of Asn-316 to also form a hydrogen bond with its own backbone N–H group throughout 90% of the simulation. This introduces a major perturbation in the helicity of TM-7 as shown schematically in Fig.2. The helicity in this area is weakened by the presence of Pro-317, which cannot form a hydrogen bond to Ser-313. The interaction of Asn-316 with its own backbone prevents the formation of a hydrogen bond to Asn-312, which is positioned above it. This local disruption of helical hydrogen bonds unwinds the helix between Asn-312 and Asn-316. Consequently, Ser-313 forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond to Ile-309 and Tyr-310, Ala-314 hydrogen bonds to Leu-311, leaving the carbonyls of Asn-312 and Ala-314 without hydrogen bonding partners. Hydrogen bonding patterns are also disrupted below Asn-316 because the helix is kinked and unwound. Consequently, Asn-321 hydrogen bonds to Asn-316 and Ile-319 to Ile-315 leaving Val-318 and Tyr-320 without hydrogen bonds. A similar disruption of helicity in TM-7 was proposed on the basis of the observation that an Asn-Pro motif (as in Asn-316–Pro-317) is a helix breaker (23Konvicka K. Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Biophys. J. 1995; 62 (Abstract): A446Google Scholar). The effects of substituting Ala for Asp-71 or for Asn-43 and Asn-316 are illustrated in Fig. 3. Introducing an Ala substitution in the position of Asn-316 no longer constrains TM-7 by the hydrogen bond to Asp-71, and its helicity is restored. This occurs both in the N316A (not shown) and the N43A/N316A mutants. Similarly, a substitution of Asp-71 to Ala results in the loss of a hydrogen bond to Asn-316. Unconstrained, Asn-316 turns to form a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of Ser-313, which is left available due to the imide nitrogen of Pro-317. Finally, the constraining effect of the hydrogen bonding network can be noticed in the N43A/N316A double mutant receptor in which Asp-71, no longer constrained by these residues, turns to form a hydrogen bond with the backbone N–H of Met-51 in TM-1. Disruption of hydrogen bonds present in WT TRH-R has major effects on the structure of the helical bundle. As shown in Fig. 3, Aand B, mutating Asp-71 to Ala has a major effect on the intracellular portion of the helices. A comparison to WT receptor shows major disturbances in TM-1 (Fig. 3 A) and in TM-5 and TM-6 (Fig. 3 B). Despite major changes in the helicity of TM-7 (see above), its position in the helical bundle does not change much compared with WT. The extent of the difference between the helical bundles can be expressed by the rmsd between Cα atoms of WT and D71A TRH-Rs of 1.78 Å. In contrast, the conformations of the backbones of the mutant D71A TRH-R and the double mutant N43A/N316A TRH-R are similar. As can be seen in Fig. 3, C and D, there is excellent overlap of D71A and N43A/N316A TRH-Rs and the rmsd between the Cα atoms of the helices is only 1.01 Å. Hence, the simulations establish a proposed link between the disturbance of the helical bundle and the similar nonresponding phenotype of the D71A and the N43A/N316A TRH-Rs. The major experimental finding reported herein is that the effect of substituting Asn-43 in TM-1 and Asn-316 in TM-7 with Ala in a doubly mutated TRH-R leads to the same complete loss of activity as the previously reported effect of substituting Asp-71 in TM-2 with Ala (18Perlman J.H. Nussenzveig D.R. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24413-24417Google Scholar). These data are consistent with our model of the TRH·TRH-R complex which predicts that Asp-71 interacts with both Asn-43 and Asn-316 forming a bridge between them. Moreover, the modeling shows that the D71A and N43A/N316A TRH-Rs exhibit disruption of hydrogen bonds usually present in the native receptor that results in similar changes in the intracellular aspects of the helices of these mutant receptors. Thus, we conclude that a structural feature of TRH-R that is important for activation involves the bridging of these specific residues in TMs 1, 2, and 7. It has been proposed that four conserved residues in TMs 1, 2, and 7 of the α1B-adrenergic receptor, which includes the residues homologous to Asn-43, Asp-71, and Asn-316 of TRH-R, form a polar pocket that interacts with an Arg residue of the conserved Asp-Arg-Tyr (DRY) motif at the junction between TM-3 and intracellular loop 2 to constrain the receptor in an inactive conformation (14Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Google Scholar). This does not appear to be the function of these residues in TRH-R. Several differences between TRH-R and α1B-adrenergic receptor regarding activity have been found when similar experiments were performed with homologous mutants in the two systems. 1) We have not been able to demonstrate basal activity, that is, IP formation in the absence of agonist, for N43A TRH-R, 4J. H. Perlman, W. Wang, K. Bence, and M. C. Gershengorn, unpublished observations. as was shown for the corresponding N63A α1B-adrenergic receptor. It may be that a more sensitive system is needed to demonstrate constitutive activity of TRH-Rs. Alternatively, it is possible that similar structural changes induced by the mutation of the Asn in TM-1 may result in different phenotypes of the mutant receptors. 2) N43A TRH-R is only approximately half as active as WT TRH-R in the presence of maximally effective concentrations of TRH, whereas N63A α1B-adrenergic receptor was reported to be as active as WT α1B-adrenergic receptor. Thus, the role(s) of Asn in TM-1 in basal and agonist-induced activity is different in TRH-R and α1B-adrenergic receptor. 3) R123A TRH-R retains substantial activity in response to TRH,4 whereas the mutant receptor with the corresponding substitution of Arg within the Asp-Arg-Tyr motif with Ala in α1B-adrenergic receptor is inactive. Thus, the role of this Arg is at least quantitatively different in agonist activation of TRH-R and of the α1B-adrenergic receptor. It appears, therefore, that there are differences in the roles of highly conserved residues in different members of the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic receptor subfamily of GPCRs (see below). Substitutions by alanines in mutated proteins may be the most reliable indicators of the roles of substituted native residues. Although polar substitutions for polar residues have the potential for restoring native interactions, they also may introduce strong non-native hydrogen bonding or ionic interactions. Nevertheless, the effects on activation observed with mutant TRH-Rs in which polar residues were substituted for the conserved residues support the findings observed with Ala substitutions. For example, D71N TRH-R exhibited activity that was decreased to 52% of WT TRH-R. However, when Asn-316 was mutated to Asp, the effect of mutating Asp-71 to Asn in the doubly mutated receptor, D71N/N316D TRH-R, was reversed. That is, the maximal activity of D71N/N316D TRH-R was similar to that of WT TRH-R. This restorative effect is consistent with proximity or interaction of the substituted residues (24Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Google Scholar, 25LiCata V.J. Ackers G.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3133-3139Google Scholar, 26Mildvan A.S. Weber D.J. Kuliopulos A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 327-340Google Scholar). By switching residues in this way, a similar conclusion was reached with regard to these residues in the 5HT2A receptor (12Sealfon S.C. Chi L. Ebersole B.J. Rodic V. Zhang D. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16683-16688Google Scholar). The native GnRH receptor contains Asn at the position homologous to Asp-71 of TRH-R and Asp at the position homologous to Asn-316 of TRH-R. A double mutant GnRH receptor in which these residues were switched resulted in restoration of binding though not of activation (13Zhou W. Flanagan C. Ballesteros J.A. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170Google Scholar). Thus, these highly conserved Asn residues in TMs 1 and 7 and Asp in TM-2 are important for agonist-stimulated signaling. These data also highlight the fact that similar substitutions in different receptors may give rise to different phenotypes. Such a behavior suggests that another factor,e.g. the conformation of the intracellular loops, may be important in the appearance of a certain phenotype. The double mutant N43D/N316D TRH-R, at a maximally effective concentration of TRH, exhibited only 15% of the WT TRH-R maximal activity. However, specific binding by this double mutant could not be measured (Table I) and, therefore, we could not ascribe the lowered IP formation to an intrinsic property of the mutant receptor. In fact, as our inability to measure specific binding was likely due to markedly lowered cell surface expression, the apparent decrease in stimulation of IPs was likely due to low receptor number. This is so because binding was detectable in several mutant receptors with lower potencies than N43D/N316D TRH-R (Tables I and II), and there is usually a good correlation between potency and affinity in TRH-R mutants (27Gershengorn M.C. Osman R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 175-191Google Scholar). Although there may be several reasons for decreased expression of N43D/N316D TRH-R, it is reasonable to speculate, in conjunction with other findings described above, that it may be due to an abnormal receptor structure caused by a repulsive effect between the introduced Asp residues which would be consistent with proximity of the native residues in TRH-R. Aside from supporting the idea that Asn-43, Asp-71, and Asn-316 are proximate and interact, the data allow conclusions to be drawn regarding the importance of the side chains of these residues in activation. Analysis of the single Ala mutants indicate that Asn-43, Asp-71, and Asn-316 are all important for activation. Asn can partially substitute for the function of Asp-71 and allow for partial activation suggesting that both oxygens of Asp-71 are important. Asp can fully substitute for Asn-316 with regard to activation which may be interpreted in at least two ways. The carbonyl group of Asn-316 (retained by Asp) may be important for activation (implying protonation of Asp-71) or the Asp introduced at position 316 may be protonated and become a potential hydrogen bond donor (like Asn). The latter mechanism has also been suggested to explain the activity of a similar mutant in the 5HT2A receptor (12Sealfon S.C. Chi L. Ebersole B.J. Rodic V. Zhang D. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16683-16688Google Scholar). As noted above, we have proposed that the putative binding pocket for TRH is between TMs 3, 6, and 7 in TRH-R which is not close to the region occupied by Asn-43, Asp-71, and Asn-316. Therefore, effects on affinity resulting from substitution of these residues are due to indirect effects on the binding pocket. This is consistent with the idea that conserved residues would not be involved in forming a high affinity, highly specific binding pocket. The binding affinities of N43A, D71A, and N316A TRH-Rs for MeTRH (an analog of TRH with 5–10-fold higher affinity than TRH that is used as radioligand) were little changed from WT TRH-R (Table II), which is consistent with the idea that these residues do not directly contact the ligand. In fact, the larger effects on binding of substituting Asp for Asn-43 or Asn for Asp-71 appear to be deleterious effects due to the introduced substituents rather than loss of the native side chains. Thus, these data are consistent with the idea that these conserved residues do not constitute the TRH-R binding pocket. The model appears to support several interesting features of the experimental data. In WT TRH-R, the hydrogen bonding network obtained after exploring various possible patterns through the use of distance constraints, supports the idea that Asp-71 forms hydrogen bonds with both Asn-316 and Asn-43, while Asn-316 and Asn-43 do not interact with each other. In the D71A and N43A/N316A mutant receptors, however, the hydrogen bonds that maintain this network are lost. Comparison of the structures of WT and D71A TRH-Rs shows that the helical bundle undergoes a significant change which is localized to the intracellular portion of the helices. The similarity of these changes for the mutant receptors and their difference from WT TRH-R suggests that a possible mechanism for loss of activity may be related to the rearrangement of helices. These rearrangements will induce conformational changes in the intracellular loops which enable the interaction of the activated receptor with the G-protein. However, our simulations only provide part of the answer since the intracellular loops are not included. Further work will be required in constructing a model for the intracellular loops before this question can be addressed. Nevertheless, it appears that the phenotypic differences between similar mutations in different receptors (e.g. N43A in TRH-R versus N63A in α1B-adrenergic receptor (14Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Google Scholar)) may result from different consequences in the conformations of the intracellular loops caused by similar changes in the TM portions. The highly conserved Asp in TM-2 has been implicated in a number of functional roles in GPCRs including activation, binding and allosteric regulation by Na+ (28Van Rhee A.M. Jacobson K.A. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 37: 1-38Google Scholar). The conserved Asn in TM-7, which is part of a highly conserved Asn-Pro-Xaa-Xaa-Tyr (NPXXY) motif, has been shown to be important for activation in the 5HT2A (12Sealfon S.C. Chi L. Ebersole B.J. Rodic V. Zhang D. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16683-16688Google Scholar), angiotensin AII (29Hunyady L. Bor M. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16602-16609Google Scholar), and β2-adrenergic receptors (30Barak L.S. Ménard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Colapietro A.M. Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15407-15414Google Scholar). Interestingly, an extensive review of GPCR site-specific substitutions shows that residues in TM-1 have rarely been targeted (28Van Rhee A.M. Jacobson K.A. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 37: 1-38Google Scholar) (see above). In conclusion, our experimental observations are consistent with the idea that Asn-43 of TM-1, Asp-71 of TM-2, and Asn-316 of TM-7 are proximate to one another in the native TRH-R and with a bifunctional role of Asp-71 in interacting with both Asn-43 and Asn-316. Our computational data support this idea and predict that Asp-71 forms a bridge between Asn-43 and Asn-316 that may be important in holding TRH-R in a conformation in which TM 1, 2, and 7 are apposed. The conservation of these residues suggests that these interactions may be important for the structural integrity of all members of the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic receptor GPCR subfamily."

Sex steroid hormones control cell proliferation and cell differentiation in many organs, in particular in the genital tract and mammary gland. In the endometrium, growth of epithelial cells is dependent on estrogens and progesterone, and removal of ovarian hormones has been reported to cause cell death as exemplified in different species (1Hopwood D. Levison D.A. J. Pathol. 1976; 119: 159-166Google Scholar, 2Sandow B.A. West N.B. Norman R.L. Brenner R.M. Am. J. Anat. 1979; 156: 15-36Google Scholar, 3Nawaz S. Lynch M.P. Galand P. Gerschenson L.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 127: 51-59Google Scholar). Particularly, the degenerative response in the epithelium followed the characteristic morphological and biochemical features of programmed cell death, or apoptosis (4Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Google Scholar). In the cycling human endometrium, apoptosis occurs in the glandular epithelium during the late secretory, the premenstrual, and the menstrual phases, and to a lesser extent during the proliferative phase (1Hopwood D. Levison D.A. J. Pathol. 1976; 119: 159-166Google Scholar). In the rabbit, estrogens induce proliferation of resting endometrial cells, whereas progesterone induces proliferation of already dividing cells and ultimately leads to differentiation and growth arrest. Ovariectomy of pseudopregnant rabbits, or administration of antiprogestins, cause intense apoptosis of endometrial epithelial cells (5Gerschenson L.E. Rotello R.J. Tomei L.D. Cope F.O. Apoptosis: The Molecular Basis of Cell Death. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 175-192Google Scholar, 6Rotello R.J. Lieberman R.C. Lepoff R.B. Gerschenson L.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 449-456Google Scholar). Attempts to reproduce this behavior in simplifiedin vitro cultivation systems have only partially been successful using primary cells (7Gerschenson L.E. DePaoli G.R. Murai J.T. J. Steroid Biochem. 1981; 14: 959-969Google Scholar, 8Lynch M.P. Nawaz S. Gerschenson L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4784-4788Google Scholar). The decision of cells to undergo apoptosis is controlled by external signals in combination with an autonomous genetic program. Cell death is regulated at several intracellular checkpoints by the action of members out of two gene families conferring opposite effects (9Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Google Scholar). Thebcl-2 oncogene was first identified in human B-cell tumors with a chromosomal translocation placing it within the immunoglobulin locus. Bcl-2 was the founding member of a growing family of genes controlling apoptosis. These genes show homology clustered in two regions, BH1 and BH2 (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar). Bcl-2 protects cells against some forms of apoptosis, but does not induce cell proliferation (9Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Google Scholar). Another member of the family is bax which promotes apoptosis and encodes a protein that can form homodimers or heterodimers with Bcl-2 (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar). The ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax determines the sensitivity of some cells to apoptotic stimuli and could be the target of various factors and signals that influence cell survival. Another homologue of Bcl-2, Bcl-X, exists in two isoforms generated by alternative splicing. The large form, Bcl-XL, which contains BH1 and BH2, protects cells against cell death, whereas the short form, Bcl-XS, promotes cell death by inhibiting Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL function (11Boise L.H. González-Garcı́a M. Postema C.E. Ding L.Y. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X.H. Nuñez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Google Scholar). Additional members of the bcl-2 family have been identified which influence the apoptotic pathway (12Choi S.S. Park I.C. Yun J.W. Sung Y.C. Hong S.I. Shin H.S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1693-1698Google Scholar, 13Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Chinnadurai G.

Rutanen E.M. Fertil. Steril. 1996; 65: 776-782Google Scholar). Interestingly, another checkpoint on the apoptotic pathway is provided by the balance of two alternatively sliced isoforms encoding different species of interleukin-1β converting enzyme (9Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Google Scholar). The finding that bcl-2 is expressed in the terminal differentiated syncytial trophoblast and in endometrium suggested that Bcl-2 may be related to hormone-dependent apoptosis (16Lu Q.L. Poulsom R. Wong L. Hanby A.M. J. Pathol. 1993; 169: 431-437Google Scholar). In human epithelial endometrial cells Bcl-2 predominates at the end of the follicular phase and is low or absent in the secretory phase, when electron microscopic analysis shows apoptotic cells (17Otsuki Y. Misaki O. Sugimoto O. Ito Y. Tsujimoto Y. Akao Y. Lancet. 1994; 344: 28-29Google Scholar). These studies suggest that Bcl-2 may be involved in protection against apoptosis during the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, but does not seem to play a role in luteal phase (18Koh E.A.T. Illingworth P.J. Duncan W.C. Critchley H.O.D. Hum. Reprod. 1995; 10: 1557-1562Google Scholar). Presumingly bcl-2 could be a direct target for steroid hormones, as there are potential hormone responsive elements in the bcl-2 gene promoter (17Otsuki Y. Misaki O. Sugimoto O. Ito Y. Tsujimoto Y. Akao Y. Lancet. 1994; 344: 28-29Google Scholar). To investigate the regulation of endometrial cell proliferation and differentiation by ovarian hormones, in particular by progesterone, we have recently established cell lines from rat endometrial epithelium which exhibit some of the properties of the corresponding differentiated tissue (19Wiehle R.D. Helftenbein G. Land H. Neumann K. Beato M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 787-794Google Scholar). Whereas some lines established by immortalization with simian virus 40 large T antigen lost most of their epithelial markers and developed a fibroblast-like phenotype, additional transformation by v-Ha-ras partly restored the epithelial phenotype giving rise to the ancestor cell line RENTRO1 (20Helftenbein G. Alvarez C.V. Tuohimaa P. Beato M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2075-2085Google Scholar). Here we describe the stable gene transfer of recombinant progesterone receptor to this endometrial epithelial-like cell line to reconstitute progesterone receptor response to the formerly non-responsive line. One of the progeny cell line, RENTROP, was used to study the hormonal regulation of cell proliferation and cell death. In the presence of low serum, a fraction of the cell population undergoes apoptosis which leads to a progressive decrease in the overall cell number. Survival of these serum-starved cells can be restored by progesterone, as well as the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, which lead to a decrease in the proportion of apoptotic cells. Consistently this effect can be antagonized by the antiprogestin RU486. Progestins and glucocorticoids also induce bcl-X transcripts. Induction of bcl-X mRNA is accompanied by a shift toward a relative increase of the bcl-XLencoding isoform over the bcl-XS isoform. As the cells express low level of bcl-2 mRNA and as their level of bax mRNA is not influenced by hormonal treatment, our results suggest that the effect of progesterone deprivation on the apoptosis in the endometrial epithelium is mediated by a reversal of the ratio between apoptosis-inducing and apoptosis-preventing isoforms of bcl-X. An endometrial epithelial cell line that stably expresses the progesterone receptor was generated by applying two rounds of calcium phosphate precipitate-mediated gene transfer to the rat endometrial RENTRO-1 cell line (20Helftenbein G. Alvarez C.V. Tuohimaa P. Beato M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2075-2085Google Scholar). First tetracycline repressor-VP16 expression plasmid (21Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Google Scholar) was stably introduced into RENTRO-1 cells using the hygromycin-B phosphotransferase gene as selection marker (22Blochlinger K. Diggelmann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2929-2931Google Scholar). One of the selected clones, which is referred to as parental RENTRO-1, was stably transfected with a tetracycline-inducible vector for the rabbit progesterone receptor (23Loosfelt H. Atger M. Misrahi M. Guiochon-Mantel A. Meriel C. Logeat F. Benarous R. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1986; 83: 9045-9049Google Scholar) (expression vector constructed and supplied by M. Gossen, Heidelberg) using puromycin-N-acetyltransferase as selection marker (24de la Luna S. Soria I. Pulido D. Ortı́n J. Jiménez A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 62: 121-126Google Scholar). Several puromycin-resistant clones were obtained, which expressed functional PR in the absence of tetracycline, one of which, RENTROP, was selected for use in this study. Parental RENTRO-1 cells, as well as the progeny RENTROP cells, were cultured on polystyrene plastic dishes (Greiner) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS, 1The abbreviations used are: FCS, fetal calf serum; bp, base pair(s); PR, progesterone receptor. c.c. pro GmbH, Neustadt W., Germany) and 5% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and glutamine (2 mm) at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. RENTROP cells were maintained in medium supplemented with unstripped serum in the presence of tetracycline at 10 μg/ml. Before the experiments, tetracycline was omitted for at least 1 week. Apoptosis was studied in cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with dextran-charcoal stripped FCS (CS-FCS) (25Lippman M. Bolan G. Huff K. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 4595-4601Google Scholar) containing phenol red. For serum depletion cells were grown in medium containing 10% CS-FCS for 9 h before the medium was adjusted to the desired serum concentration in the presence or absence of added hormones. Hormones were applied from 1000-fold stock solutions in ethanol. Unless stated otherwise the following hormone concentrations were used: the synthetic progestin R5020, 10 nm; progesterone (Sigma), 0.1 μm; dexamethasone (Sigma), 10 nm; the antiprogestin RU38486 (Roussel-Uclaf, Romainville, France), 1 μm; and the antiprogestin ZK98299 (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany), 0.1 μm. Viable cells were counted in a Neubauer hemocytometer by the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Trypsinized cells were counted within 5 min to avoid further damage. Transient transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure as described (26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). As progesterone and glucocorticoid responsive reporter a plasmid pGRE2-tk-Luc (5 μg) was used (constructed and kindly supplied by K. Joos, Marburg), containing a doublet of the canonical progesterone/glucocorticoid responsive element (27Strähle U. Klock G. Schütz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7871-7875Google Scholar) in front of the truncated (−109 to +51) promoter of the thymidine kinase gene of herpes simplex virus driving the luciferase gene. The response of the reporter plasmid to glucocorticoids and progestins has been verified in various endometrial as well as non-endometrial cell lines (data not shown). Cells were fixed in 2.25% (w/v) formaldehyde, 1.25% (w/v) glutaraldehyde, and 0.025% (w/v) picric acid in 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.3, contrasted with 1% OsO4 under reducing conditions, and soaked in 0.3% uranyl-acetate solution and 50 mmmaleic acid as described (28Hensel G. Meyer H. Gärtner S. Brand G. Kern H.F. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1591-1601Google Scholar). After dehydration the samples were mounted in Epon and slides were prepared using an Ultracut E microtome (Leica, Bensheim, Germany). Contrasting was intensified through incorporation of lead citrate and micrographs were taken employing an electron microscope EM9 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Cells were fixed in situ in 4% phosphate-buffered saline-buffered formaldehyde. After equilibration in terminal deoxynucleotide transferase buffer (30 mm Tris, 140 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2, 1 mm CoCl2) for 30 min at room temperature, cells were incubated in terminal deoxynucleotide transferase buffer containing 40 μm fluorescein-15-dATP (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) and 0.25 units/μl of terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (Boehringer, Mannheim) in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by incubating the cells in a solution containing 300 mm NaCl and 30 mm sodium citrate for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were counterstained with an aqueous solution of 4 μg/ml propidium iodide for 15 min. Cells were rinsed with water, mounted in Mowiol (Höchst, Frankfurt) with 0.2 g/literpara-phenylenediamine, and examined by fluorescence microscopy (Leitz, Wetzlar). For the detection of degraded DNA products, DNA from 3 × 106 cells was isolated according to Ref. 29Herrmann M. Lorenz H.-M. Voll R. Grünke M. Woith W. Kalden J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5506-5507Google Scholar. Briefly, the cells were lysed in 0.1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40) for 30 s. After centrifugation 2,000 ×g for 5 min at room temperature apoptotic DNA remained in the supernatant while intact nuclear DNA was recovered in the pellet. The supernatants were treated at 56 °C for 2 h with RNase A (5 mg/ml) and SDS (1%) followed by digestion with proteinase K (2.5 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 18 h. DNA was precipitated and electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. A 100-bp DNA ladder (Boehringer, Mannheim) was used as size marker. Quantitation of DNA was performed as described in the figure legends. Total cellular RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). RNase protection analysis was performed as described below (31Zinn K. DiMaio D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1983; 34: 865-879Google Scholar). For preparing the bcl-X probe, plasmid pGLD3 was digested withHinfI and transcribed by T3 RNA polymerase. The full-length transcript size of the bcl-X riboprobe was 294 bp, and the protected fragments for bcl-XL andbcl-XS were 237 and 155 bp long, respectively. For preparing the bcl-2 probe, plasmid prBCL2 was digested with PvuII and transcribed by T3 RNA polymerase. The full-length transcipt size of the riboprobe was 416 bp, and the protected fragments for bcl-2α and bcl-2β were 371 and 234 bp long, respectively. The rat gapdhtemplate pTRIGAPDH (Ambion, Austin, TX) was digested withBglI and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase. The probe length was 204 bp and the size of the protected fragment was 145 bp. [α-32P]CTP (Amersham, Braunschweig) radiolabeled RNA probes were prepared using a kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). The probes were coprecipitated with RNA samples and dissolved in hybridization buffer, denatured at 95 °C for 10 min, and hybridized at 52 °C for 18 h. After digestion with RNases A and T1, followed by digestion with proteinase K, the samples were precipitated, denatured, and subjected to electrophoresis on a 5% denaturing acrylamide gel. Quantitation was performed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) using Image-Quant software. In all cases the quatitation was normalized against the gapdh signal. For Northern blot analysis 25 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to nylon membrane, type NY 13N (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were hybridized with32P-labeled 400-bp fragment of rat bax (32Tilly J.L. Tilly K.I. Kenton M.L. Johnson A.L. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 232-241Google Scholar) for 16 h and washed in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Quantitation was done from densitometric scans of autoradiographs; normalization was calculated referring to the 28 S ribosomal RNA or thegapdh signal. 1.5 × 105 cells were incubated in 6 wells plates in medium containing 10% CS-FCS for 12 h. The medium was removed and 1 ml of medium with 1% CS-FCS and 1 μCi of [35S]methionine (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany, 37 TBq/mmol), and incubation was continued for 5 h in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (100 ng/ml). The incubation was stopped by harvesting the cells in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% SDS. Cells were lysed by treatment with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min on ice and the lysates were filtrated through glass microfiber filters GF/C (Whatman). Filters were washed twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid and once with ethanol and radioactivity on the filters was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. The results are expressed as incorporated disintegrations/min/well and correspond to the average of two independent experiments performed by triplicates. Protein extracts were prepared by lysing cells at 4 °C for 1 h in 2 volumes of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Nonidet P-40). The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C for 10 min, and the pellet discarded. Protein concentration in the supernatant was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). After adjusting to sample buffer and boiling for 5 min, 100 μg of protein were applied on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis was performed at 25 mA for 2 h. The resolved proteins were transferred to an Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham) by electroblotting. Antibody incubation was performed in blocking buffer (1% skim milk, 0.5% Tween) in Tris-buffered saline at 4 °C. As primary antibodies were applied to rabbit polyclonal anti-Bax (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-actin (Sigma Immunochemicals). As secondary antibody, a peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody was used (Amersham). Proteins bands were detected using the ECL kit (Amersham). The previously characterized RENTRO-1 endometrial cell line, as well as the parental clone used in these experiments, express glucocorticoid receptor but do not contain significant levels of progesterone receptor (PR), as demonstrated in steroid binding assays (20Helftenbein G. Alvarez C.V. Tuohimaa P. Beato M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2075-2085Google Scholar) and transient transfection (Table I). To obtain a progestin-responsive endometrial epithelial-like cell line the parental RENTRO-1 cells were stably transfected with an expression vector for the rabbit PR (23Loosfelt H. Atger M. Misrahi M. Guiochon-Mantel A. Meriel C. Logeat F. Benarous R. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1986; 83: 9045-9049Google Scholar). Several clones, including RENTROP, were shown to express a functional PR, as demonstrated in transient transfection experiments using the progesterone inducible reporter plasmid pGRE2-tk-Luc (TableI). The level of induction with the synthetic progestin R5020 in RENTROP cells was comparable to values obtained in other PR expressing cell lines, as for example, mammary carcinoma-derived T47D (33Horwitz K.B. Zava D.T. Thilagia A.K. Jensen E.M. McGuire W.L. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 2434-2437Google Scholar) or diverse rabbit endometrial cell lines. 2A. Scholz and M. Beato, unpublished data. Note that in RENTROP cells the response to dexamethasone was about 5-fold higher than the response to R5020, suggesting a high level of constitutive glucocorticoid receptor expression. Note that the differences in absolute value of glucocorticoid induction between RENTRO-1 and RENTROP cells do not reflect significant differences in glucocorticoid receptor activity between the cell lines, as independently confirmed by another series of reporter transfection experiments (data not shown).Table IExpression of a functional recombinant progesterone receptor in RENTROP cellsCells typeHormoneLuciferase activity1-aLuciferase units per mg of protein.

Open table in a new tab In the absence of hormone, RENTROP cells cultivated in medium supplemented with charcoal-stripped FCS exhibited a morphology which did not differ significantly from that of the parental RENTRO-1 cells. The cells were well attached to the plastic surface, polygonal or elongated in shape, had an enlarged cytoplasm and a regular cell surface (Fig. 1, left panel). Following treatment with progestins, RENTROP cells, but not parental RENTRO-1 cells (data not shown), changed morphology. While some cells showed a more elongated spindle-like appearance and exhibited dendritic protrusions, other cells rounded up and became only weakly attached to the plastic surface (Fig. 1, right panel). In addition, some enlarged cells appeared exhibiting a larger cell nucleus (see also ultrastructure, Fig. 3). Concomitant treatment with the antiprogestin RU486 antagonized the morphological changes induced by progestins. Interestingly a similar morphological change was observed in response to the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone both in RENTROP cells as well as the parental RENTRO-1 cell line (data not shown).Figure 3Morphology of RENTROP cells in electron micrographs. A, control apoptotic cells grown in medium with 2.5% CS-FCS in the absence of added hormone for 24 h and further incubated in the absence or presence of the indicated hormones for 24 h.

At 10% CS-FCS the cell number was increased by addition of the synthetic progestin R5020 (Fig.2, upper panel) or the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone and this effect was reverted by the antagonist RU486 (data not shown). In the presence of 1% CS-FCS and under the influence of glucocorticoids or progestins, RENTROP cells maintained their number in culture. In the absence of hormone or in the presence of antiprogestional RU486 the cell number decreased due to a loss of dying cells (Fig. 2, middle panel). At 0.1% CS-FCS even addition of hormones was not sufficient to prevent cell death (Fig. 2, lower panel). An electron microscopical analysis of cells cultivated at low serum in the absence of progestins or glucocorticoids (Fig.3 A), or in the presence of the antihormone RU486 (Fig. 3 B), demonstrated apoptotic cells with condensed cell nucleus, shrunk cytoplasm, but with intact organelles. Furthermore, the cells exhibited membrane blebs at the cell surface, a characteristic feature of apoptotically dying cells. In the presence of either R5020 (Fig. 3 C) or dexamethasone (data not shown), the cells showed an even surface, and some of them were enlarged and exhibited an extensively developed ergastoplasm, indicative of secretory cells (see higher magnification in Fig. 3 D). The fraction of RENTROP cells that undergo apoptosis when cultivated under serum starvation (1% FCS) was determined using a cytochemical assay that detects DNA nicks (34Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Bensasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Google Scholar). A representative example of the results is shown in Fig. 4. Quantitation of the stained cells grown in the absence of ligand (Fig. 4, upper left panel) showed that 74% (±6) of the cells were positive for nicked DNA. In the presence of progesterone (Fig. 4, upper right panel) the proportion of apoptotic cells decreased to 39% (±9), and addition of the antagonist RU486 counteracted the effect of progesterone (Fig. 4, lower right panel), leaving 72% (±3) of apoptotic cells. Dexamethasone treatment also reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells to 44% (data not shown). The effects of glucocorticoids and progestins were additive (Fig. 4, lower left panel), leaving only 22% (±7) of apoptotic cells. A similar result was obtained when the genomic DNA of the cells was analyzed in agarose gel electrophoresis for the occurrence of the characteristic nucleosomal ladder found in apoptotic cells. Using an assay which selectively solubilizes nuclease cleaved DNA (29Herrmann M. Lorenz H.-M. Voll R. Grünke M. Woith W. Kalden J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5506-5507Google Scholar), a nucleosomal ladder was found with serum-starved cells (1% CS-FCS) grown in the absence of hormone (Fig. 5 A, left panel). The proportion of degraded DNA was estimated after incubation with various hormones (Fig. 5 B). The numbers obtained from the densitometric scans confirmed the values fou"

In the dark, the activity of the enzyme catalytic α and β subunits (Pαβ) is inhibited by two γ subunits (Pγ). Previous results have established that approximately 5–7 C-terminal residues of Pγ comprise the inhibitory domain. To study the interaction between the Pγ C-terminal region and Pαβ, the Pγ mutant (Cys68 → Ser, and the last 4 C-terminal residues replaced with cysteine, Pγ-1–83Cys) was labeled with the fluorescent probe 3-(bromoacetyl)-7-diethylaminocoumarin (BC) at the cysteine residue (Pγ-1–83BC). Pγ-1–83BC was a more potent inhibitor of PDE activity than the unlabeled mutant, suggesting that the fluorescent probe in part substitutes for the Pγ C terminus in PDE inhibition. HoloPDE (Pαβγ2) had no effect on the Pγ-1–83BC fluorescence, but the addition of Pαβ to Pγ-1–83BC resulted in an approximately 8-fold maximal fluorescence increase. AK d for the Pγ-1–83BC-Pαβ interaction was 4.0 ± 0.5 nm. Zaprinast, a specific competitive inhibitor of PDE, effectively displaced the Pγ-1–83BC C terminus from its binding site on Pαβ (IC50 = 0.9 μm). cGMP and its analogs, 8-Br-cGMP and 2′-butyryl-cGMP, also competed with the Pγ-1–83BC C terminus for binding to Pαβ. Our results provide new insight into the mechanism of PDE inhibition by showing that Pγ blocks the binding of cGMP to the PDE catalytic site.

In the visual transduction cascade of rod photoreceptor cells, the photoexcited visual receptor, rhodopsin, interacts with the rod G-protein, transducin, and stimulates the exchange of GTP for bound GDP. The GTP-bound α subunit of transducin dissociates from rhodopsin and the transducin βγ subunits and activates the effector enzyme, cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), 1The abbreviations used are: PDE, rod outer segment cGMP phosphodiesterase; tPDE, phosphodiesterase activated with limited trypsin digestion to remove γ subunits; ROS, rod outer segment; BC, 3-(bromoacetyl)-7-diethylaminocoumarin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. by relieving the inhibitory constraint imposed by two identical inhibitory subunits of PDE (Pγ) on the enzyme αβ catalytic subunits (Pαβ) (for review see Refs. 1Chabre M.

Insights into the Pγ-Pαβ interaction are critical for understanding the mechanisms of PDE inhibition by Pγ and PDE activation by transducin. Approximately 5–7 C-terminal amino acid residues of Pγ are involved in the inhibitory interaction with Pαβ (5Lipkin B.M. Dumler I.L. Muradov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Etingof R.N.

Recently, using a cross-linking approach we have identified a site on Pα for binding of the Pγ C terminus as a region Pα-751–763 within the PDE catalytic domain (10Artemyev N.O. Natochin M. Busman M. Schey K.L. Hamm H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5407-5412Google Scholar). The finding suggests that the Pγ C terminus either occupies the site for binding and catalysis of cGMP or induces local conformational changes of the PDE catalytic site that block cGMP hydrolysis. Here, we study the interaction between the C terminus of Pγ and Pαβ using a novel fluorescence assay to elucidate the mechanism of PDE inhibition by Pγ. cGMP was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. 3-(bromoacetyl)-7-diethylaminocoumarin (BC) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Trypsin and soybean trypsin inhibitor were from Worthington. Zaprinast and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Bovine rod outer segment (ROS) membranes were prepared by the method of Papermaster and Dreyer (11Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Google Scholar).

PDE and trypsin-activated PDE (tPDE) were prepared and purified as described previously (6Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 273-279Google Scholar). The purified proteins were kept in 40% glycerol at −20 °C. The Pγ subunit was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described in Ref. 9Skiba N.P. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. J. Biol.

To obtain Pγ-1–83BC and PγBC, a 5 mm stock solution of BC (final concentration, 200 μm) was added to either 100 μm Pγ-1–83Cys or 100 μm Pγ, each in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.6), and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Pγ-1–83BC and PγBC were then passed through a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.6) containing 100 mm NaCl and purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a C-4 column Microsorb-MW (Rainin) using a 0–100% gradient of acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The preparations of Pγ-1–83BC and PγBC contained no free BC. Using ε445 = 53,000 for BC, the molar ratio of BC incorporation into Pγ and Pγ-1–83BC was greater than 0.8 mol/mol. Pγ-24–45BC was prepared by labeling of peptide Pγ-24–45Cys and purified as described in Ref. 13Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19964-19969Google Scholar. A Pγ mutant, PγCys68 → Ser, and a peptide, Pγ-24–45, that contain no cysteine were not derivatized with BC under similar conditions, suggesting the selectivity of cysteine labeling. Fluorescent assays were performed on a F-2000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Hitachi) in 1 ml of 80 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 2 mmMgCl2. Fluorescence of Pγ-1–83BC, PγBC, or Pγ-24–45BC was monitored with excitation at 445 nm and emission at 495 nm. The assays were carried out at equilibrium, which was typically reached less than 3 s after mixing of the components. The concentration of labeled polypeptides was determined using ε445 = 53,000. Where indicated, zaprinast was added from 1 mm stock solution to an assay buffer. TheK d values in Figs. 2 and 4 were calculated by fitting the data to Equation 1, FF0=1+FF0max−1×XKd+XEquation 1 where F0 is a basal fluorescence of Pγ-1–83BC or Pγ-24–45BC, F is the fluorescence after additions of tPDE, F/F0max is the maximal relative increase of fluorescence, and X is a concentration of free tPDE.Figure 4Effect of zaprinast on apparentK d for Pγ-1–83BC binding to Pαβ.Zaprinast was added to Pγ-1–83BC (10 nm) at indicated concentrations, and then the relative increase in fluorescence (F/F0) of Pγ-1–83BC was determined after the addition of increasing concentrations of tPDE. The calculated apparentK d values for Pγ-1–83BC binding to tPDE in the presence of 0.5, 2 and 4 μm of zaprinast were 5.1 ± 0.7, 14.7 ± 0.9, and 22.6 ± 1.3 nm, respectively. ♦, 5 × 10−7 zaprinast; ▴, 2 × 10−6 zaprinast; ▾, 4 × 10−6zaprinast.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The IC50 values in Figs. 3 and 5 were calculated by fitting the data to the one site competition equation with variable slope: FF0=1+FF0max−11+10[X­logIC50]×HEquation 2 where X is a concentration of a competing ligand (zaprinast, cGMP, or cGMP analogs) and H is a Hill slope.Figure 5Effects of cGMP and its analogs on Pγ-1–83BC binding to Pαβ. A, fluorescence of Pγ-1–83BC (10 nm) in the presence of tPDE (total concentration, 6 nm) was measured before and after addition of increasing concentrations of cGMP. An assay buffer contained 2 mm Mg2+ (□) or 1 mm EDTA instead of Mg2+ (▪). The curves in the presence of Mg2+ (IC50 = 0.77 ± 0.01 mm; Hill slope = 0.9) and in the presence of EDTA (IC50 = 1.9 ± 0.3 mm; Hill slope = 1.1) fit the data with r values of 1.0 and 0.96, respectively. B, fluorescence of Pγ-1–83BC (10 nm) in the presence of tPDE (total concentration, 6 nm) was measured before and after addition of increasing concentrations of 8-Br-cGMP (▴) or 2′-butyryl-cGMP (▵). The curves for 8-Br-cGMP (IC50 = 0.42 ± 0.03 mm; Hill slope = 1) and for 2′-butyryl-cGMP (IC50 = 0.58 ± 0.06 mm; Hill slope = 0.85) each fit the data with r value of 0.99.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The PDE activity was measured using the proton evolution assay of Liebman and Evanczuk (14Liebman P.A. Evanczuk A.T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 532-542Google Scholar). The assay was performed at room temperature in 200 μl of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8) containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mmMgCl2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of cGMP. The pH was monitored with a pH microelectrode (Microelectrode, Inc.). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using IgG as a standard or using calculated extinction coefficients at 280 nm. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) in 12% acrylamide gels. Fitting of the experimental data was performed with nonlinear least squares criteria using GraphPad Prizm Software. The K i,K d, and IC50 values are expressed as the means ± S.E. of three independent measurements. To study the inhibitory interaction between the Pγ C terminus and Pαβ, we have replaced C-terminal amino acid residues of Pγ with a fluorescent probe by labeling the Pγ-1–83Cys mutant with BC. To determine if the fluorescent probe can substitute for the Pγ C terminus, the ability of the labeled and unlabeled mutant to inhibit tPDE was tested. Limited proteolysis of holoPDE with trypsin removes intrinsic Pγ subunits and small farnesylated and geranyl-geranylated C-terminal fragments of Pα and Pβ, respectively, leaving mainly intact active catalytic Pαβ subunits (17Hurley J.B. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11094-11099Google Scholar, 18Catty P. Deterre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 263-269Google Scholar). The Pγ-1–83Cys mutant was, as expected, a weak inhibitor of tPDE activity. It inhibited maximally only ∼50% of tPDE activity with an apparent K i value of 13 nm (not shown). The labeled mutant, Pγ-1–83BC, was a significantly more potent inhibitor of tPDE than Pγ-1–83Cys. Pγ-1–83BC almost completely inhibited tPDE activity with an apparentK i of 5.4 ± 0.5 nm (Fig.1 A). Free BC had no effect on tPDE activity at tested concentrations up to 20 μm (not shown). This suggests that when the Pγ C-terminal residues, Gly-Ile-Ile, are replaced with the fluorescent probe BC, the probe binds into a complimentary hydrophobic pocket on Pαβ and substantially restores the inhibitory potential of the Pγ-1–83Cys mutant. Furthermore, the apparent K i for tPDE inhibition by Pγ-1–83BC was influenced by the cGMP concentration in the assay. Decrease in cGMP concentration from 3 to 0.3 mm resulted in a reduction of the apparent K i value from 5.4 to 2.1 nm(Fig. 1 A). In control experiments, labeling of wild-type Pγ with BC at Cys68 did not notably affect the ability of Pγ to inhibit tPDE (not shown). Both Pγ and PγBC fully inhibited tPDE with K i values less than 0.25 nm(not shown), and the K i values were not affected by the concentration of cGMP in the assay (not shown). Next we examined effects of Pγ-1–83BC and Pγ on K m values of cGMP hydrolysis by tPDE. A K m of 90 μmwas calculated from the Michaelis-Menten plot for tPDE (Fig.1 B). This K m is consistent with earlier estimates (17Hurley J.B. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11094-11099Google Scholar). In the presence of 3.5 and 8 nm of Pγ-1–83BC, the apparent K m values were 215 and 480 μm, and V max values were 95 and 80%, respectively (Fig. 1 B). The inhibitory interaction between Pγ-1–83BC and Pαβ was not purely competitive with cGMP, because the V max values were also affected by Pγ-1–83BC (Fig. 1 B). In agreement with previous data (17Hurley J.B. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11094-11099Google Scholar), the addition of Pγ did not significantly change theK m for cGMP hydrolysis by tPDE (not shown). Addition of tPDE to Pγ-1–83BC increased the fluorescence of the probe many fold in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The binding curve shows a single class of binding sites with K d = 4.0 ± 0.5 nm and a maximal fluorescence enhancement F/F0 = 8.4 ± 0.2. No change in the fluorescence of Pγ-1–83BC was detected upon the addition of holoPDE or tPDE reconstituted with Pγ. Furthermore, addition of Pγ to the Pγ-1–83BC-Pαβ complex readily reduced fluorescence to a basal F0 level, suggesting that the fluorescent increase reflects a specific interaction between Pαβ and Pγ-1–83BC (not shown). Fluorescence of PγBC was not notably affected in the presence of tPDE. It appears that in the PγBC-Pαβ complex the probe is oriented away from the Pαβ subunits, whereas in the Pγ-1–83BC-Pαβ complex the probe occupies the pocket for binding of the Pγ C terminus. Zaprinast is a well characterized competitive inhibitor of photoreceptor PDEs and cGMP-binding, cGMP-specific PDE (19Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 773-781Google Scholar, 20McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D. Trong H.L. Colbran J.L. Thomas M.K. Walsh K.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22863-22873Google Scholar). We have investigated effects of zaprinast on the interaction between Pγ-1–83BC and Pαβ. Zaprinast had no effect on the basal fluorescence of Pγ-1–83BC. Addition of increasing concentrations of zaprinast resulted in a complete reversal of the fluorescent enhancement of Pγ-1–83BC bound to Pαβ (IC50 of 0.9 μm) (Fig. 3). Zaprinast was effective in blocking the Pγ-1–83BC-Pαβ interaction within a pharmacologically relevant range of concentrations. AK d value of 140 nm for zaprinast binding to rod PDE catalytic sites was calculated based on inhibition of PDE activity by zaprinast (19Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 773-781Google Scholar). Our assay does not allow us to calculate the true K d value for the zaprinast binding from the curve in Fig. 3 because zaprinast does not compete for the Pγ-24–45BC-Pαβ interaction (see below) and cannot completely displace Pγ-1–83BC from Pαβ. A K d value for the zaprinast-PDE interaction lower than an IC50 value of 0.9 μm (Fig. 3) can be predicted. To examine the effects of zaprinast on the apparentK d of Pγ-1–83BC binding to Pαβ, the binding curves were obtained in the presence of different concentrations of zaprinast (Fig. 4). Increasing concentrations of zaprinast reduced the fluorescent enhancement of Pγ-1–83BC by Pαβ and increased the apparent K d of the Pγ-1–83BC binding to Pαβ. The apparent K d calculated from the binding curves in the presence of 2 and 4 μm of zaprinast were 14.7 ± 0.9 and 22.6 ± 1.3 nm, respectively. The decrease in fluorescence of the Pγ-1–83BC-Pαβ complex and the increase in apparentK d values suggest that zaprinast competitively displaces the fluorescently labeled Pγ-1–83BC C terminus from the binding pocket on Pαβ. Dipyridamole, another potent competitive inhibitor of photoreceptor PDEs (19Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 773-781Google Scholar), was unsuitable for studies using our assay. Dipyridamole is highly fluorescent with maximal emission at 480 nm. To investigate if zaprinast can compete for binding between the polycationic region of Pγ, Pγ-24–45, and Pαβ, we utilized an assay of interaction between a synthetic peptide, Pγ-24–45Cys, labeled with BC and tPDE (13Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19964-19969Google Scholar). Zaprinast at concentrations that completely reversed the fluorescent enhancement of the Pγ-1–83BC-Pαβ complex had no effect on the fluorescent increase of Pγ-24–45BC caused by its binding to tPDE (not shown). At a higher concentration (10 μm), zaprinast reduced the maximal increase in fluorescence of the Pγ-24–45BC-Pαβ complex by only ∼15% without affecting the K d. The K d values for Pγ-24–45BC binding to Pαβ in the presence of 10 μm of zaprinast or with no zaprinast added were indistinguishable (∼26 nm) (not shown). Interestingly, the apparentK d values for Pγ-1–83BC binding to Pαβ at higher concentrations of zaprinast (Fig. 4) approached theK d for the Pγ-24–45BC-Pαβ complex. This supports the notion that zaprinast competes with the Pγ-1–83BC C terminus for binding to Pαβ and does not affect the interaction of the polycationic region, Pγ-24–45, with Pαβ. The relative potency of zaprinast in competition with the Pγ-1–83BC C terminus for binding to Pαβ indicated that cGMP and its analogs might be effective as well. Effects of cGMP on the Pγ-1–83BC-Pαβ interaction were tested in the presence or the absence of Mg2+. Mg2+participates in binding of cGMP to the PDE catalytic site and is critical for cGMP hydrolysis. In the presence of Mg2+, cGMP reversed the fluorescent enhancement of Pγ-1–83BC bound to Pαβ with an apparent IC50 of 0.77 mm (Fig.5 A). Presumably, cGMP would be significantly more effective in the absence of cGMP hydrolysis. In the presence of EDTA, cGMP was ∼2.5-fold less potent (IC50 of 1.9 mm, Fig. 5 A). Because cGMP is not hydrolyzed in the presence of EDTA, the data suggest that Mg2+ enhances affinity of cGMP for the catalytic site by more than 2.5-fold. We also tested two cGMP analogs, 8-Br-cGMP and 2′-butyryl-cGMP, because they block ROS-PDE activity with a relatively high affinity (21Beltman J. Becker D. Butt E. Jensen G.S. Rybalkin S.D. Jastorff Beavo J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 330-339Google Scholar). Both cGMP analogs competed with the Pγ-1–83BC C terminus for binding to Pαβ (Fig. 5 B). The IC50 values from the competition curves for 8-Br-cGMP and 2′-butyryl-cGMP were 0.42 mm and 0.58 mm, respectively. Perhaps, an IC50 for 2′-butyryl-cGMP was higher than an IC50 for 8-Br-cGMP because tPDE hydrolyzed 2′-butyryl-cGMP with a rate of ∼15% of cGMP hydrolysis, whereas 8-Br-cGMP was resistant to the hydrolysis (not shown). Interaction between the inhibitory γ subunits of PDE and the catalytic Pαβ subunits is essential for blocking PDE activity in the dark and for inactivation of the enzyme upon recovery of the photoreceptor cell from light stimulation. The Pγ subunits bind to Pαβ with very high affinity (K d < 100 pm) (22Wensel T.G. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2155-2161Google Scholar). The high affinity of the Pγ-Pαβ interaction is provided by two major binding sites on Pγ, the central polycationic region, Pγ-24–45, and the C-terminal 5–7 amino acid residues (5Lipkin B.M. Dumler I.L. Muradov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Etingof R.N. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 287-290Google Scholar, 6Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 273-279Google Scholar, 7Takemoto D.J. Hurt D. Oppert B. Cunnick J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 637-643Google Scholar, 8Brown R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5918-5925Google Scholar, 9Skiba N.P. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13210-13215Google Scholar). The main role of the Pγ-24–45 region is to enhance the affinity of Pγ interaction with Pαβ. The C terminus of Pγ is critical for PDE inhibition. Truncations of the Pγ C-terminal residues lead to a loss of the Pγ inhibitory function (5Lipkin B.M. Dumler I.L. Muradov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Etingof R.N. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 287-290Google Scholar, 8Brown R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5918-5925Google Scholar, 9Skiba N.P. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13210-13215Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to the C-terminal region of Pγ can fully inhibit PDE activity (6Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 273-279Google Scholar, 7Takemoto D.J. Hurt D. Oppert B. Cunnick J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 637-643Google Scholar, 9Skiba N.P. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13210-13215Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the C-terminal region of Pγ binds within the catalytic domain of PDE (10Artemyev N.O. Natochin M. Busman M. Schey K.L. Hamm H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5407-5412Google Scholar). This finding raised the possibility that Pγ may inhibit PDE activity by physically blocking the binding site for cGMP. An alternative mechanism of PDE inhibition by Pγ would be a local conformational change of the PDE catalytic site that prevents cGMP hydrolysis. Standard analysis for competitive (noncompetitive) inhibition of cGMP hydrolysis may not discriminate between the two mechanisms because Pγ binds to Pαβ very tightly (K d <100 pm) compared with cGMP binding (K m for cGMP is within 17–80 μmrange) (17Hurley J.B. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11094-11099Google Scholar, 19Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 773-781Google Scholar, 22Wensel T.G. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2155-2161Google Scholar). The large differences in affinity and very slow off-rates of Pγ from Pαβ (>10 min) (8Brown R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5918-5925Google Scholar, 22Wensel T.G. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2155-2161Google Scholar) may not allow cGMP to compete with Pγ bound to Pαβ. It has been shown previously that the addition of Pγ to tPDE caused very little change in the apparentK m value (17Hurley J.B. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11094-11099Google Scholar). Indeed, in our experiments theK m value of 90 μm was unaffected by the addition of Pγ. To study the mechanism of PDE inhibition by Pγ, we developed an assay that reports binding of the Pγ C terminus to Pαβ. The assay utilizes a Pγ mutant with the C-terminal amino acid residues replaced with a fluorescent probe, BC. The fluorescently labeled mutant, Pγ-1–83BC, was a more potent inhibitor of PDE activity than the unlabeled mutant, Pγ-1–83Cys, suggesting that the probe interacts with the inhibitory pocket on Pαβ. Addition of Pγ-1–83BC to Pαβ led to a dose-dependent increase of the apparentK m values for cGMP hydrolysis. Binding of Pγ-1–83BC to Pαβ produced a large ∼8-fold increase in the probe fluorescence. Zaprinast, a specific competitive inhibitor of photoreceptor PDEs, effectively competed for the interaction between Pγ-1–83BC and Pαβ, but had no effect on binding of the polycationic region, Pγ-24–45, to Pαβ. Perhaps the fact that Pγ-1–83BC binds to Pαβ (K d of 4 nm) less tightly than Pγ has helped zaprinast to compete for the Pγ-1–83BC-Pαβ interaction. cGMP and its analogs, 8-Br-cGMP and 2′-butyryl-cGMP, were also effective in blocking the interaction between the Pγ-1–83BC C terminus and Pαβ using the fluorescent assay. Effects of cGMP and its analogs on the Pγ-1–83BC binding to Pαβ cannot be attributed to the noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites of PDE, because bovine rod PDE contains two molecules of tightly bound cGMP with an extremely slow off-rate (t½ = ∼4 h) (23Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4311-4315Google Scholar). Overall, our data strongly suggest that Pγ inhibits PDE activity by physically blocking access of the substrate, cGMP, to the PDE catalytic site. The region of Pα, Pα-751–763, that interacts with the C terminus of Pγ (10Artemyev N.O. Natochin M. Busman M. Schey K.L. Hamm H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5407-5412Google Scholar) is adjacent to the NKXD motif. In G-proteins, the NKXD motif specifies binding of the GTP guanine ring (24Jurnak F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 196-198Google Scholar, 25Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Google Scholar). Based on our results, it is likely that the NKXD motif is involved in the binding of cGMP by photoreceptor PDEs."

Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression constructs containing regions of the human collagenase-1 promoter were stably or transiently transfected into U937 cells, and reporter activity was assessed at various times after the onset of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-mediated differentiation. Rapid and strong induction of promoter activity was lost in constructs with a mutant AP-1 element; however, at 16–96 h post-PMA, the mutant collagenase-1 promoter displayed AP-1 independent PMA-mediated transactivation. The AP-1 mutant constructs also showed delayed transcriptional activation in PMA-treated fibroblasts. Western and supershift analyses indicated that functional Jun and Fos proteins were present in nuclear extracts of PMA-differentiated U937 cells. Promoter deletion constructs demonstrated the potential role of distal promoter sequences in regulating collagenase-1 transcription.

Remodeling of the extracellular matrix during normal development and in response to tissue injury and inflammation is thought to be accomplished, in part, by the properly regulated production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; C/EBP-β, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β; kb, kilobase(s); TK, thymidine kinase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. As a group, these enzymes can degrade essentially all extracellular matrix components, and hence, they have been implicated in normal remodeling processes, such as uterine involution, blastocyst implantation, angiogenesis, and wound healing (for review, see Refs. 1Mignatti P.

Although extracellular matrix proteins can be degraded by various proteinases, fibrillar type I collagen, the most abundant protein in the body, is resistant to degradation by most enzymes. Collagen degradation is initiated by the catalytic activity of collagenases, a subgroup of the MMP gene family with the unique ability to cleave fibrillar collagens type I, II, and III within their triple helical domain (13Jeffrey J.J. Mecham R.P. Regulation of Matrix Accumulation. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986: 53-98Google Scholar). At physiological temperature, cleaved collagen molecules denature and become susceptible to complete digestion by other proteinases. Of the three known human metallo-collagenases, collagenase-1 (MMP-1) seems to be the enzyme that is principally responsible for collagen turnover in most human tissues. In a variety of normal and disease-associated tissue remodeling events, collagenase-1 is expressed by macrophages as well as by epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and chondrocytes (14Fisher C. Gilbertson-Beadling S. Powers E.A. Petzold G. Poorman R. Mitchell M.A. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 499-510Google Scholar, 15Galis Z.S. Sukhova G.K. Lark M.W. Libby P. J. Clin.

Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16766-16773Google Scholar), is also expressed in articular cartilage (22Mitchell P.G. Magna H.A. Reeves L.M. Lopresti-Morrow L.L. Yocum S.A. Rosner P.J.

Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 759-767Google Scholar). Many agents, such as PMA, bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), and proinflammatory cytokines, and events, such as contact with type I collagen and activated T-cells, induce or markedly stimulate collagenase-1 transcription in macrophages (25Lacraz S. Isler P. Vey E. Welgus H.G. Dayer J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22027-22033Google Scholar, 26Pierce R.A. Sandefur S. Doyle G.A.R. Welgus H.G. J. Clin.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8170-8175Google Scholar). Much of what is known about the transcriptional regulation of collagenase-1 points to a critical role for the AP-1 site at −72 to −66 in the human promoter. AP-1 elements bind dimers of the Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) and Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) families of transcription factors (29Nakabeppu Y. Ryder K. Nathans D. Cell. 1988; 55: 907-915Google Scholar). Angel et al. (30Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Google Scholar) first demonstrated that the AP-1 site is necessary and sufficient to confer PMA-mediated induction of the native collagenase-1 promoter or of a heterologous promoter containing this element. However, because the level of PMA-mediated induction was greater with larger collagenase-1 promoter constructs, they concluded that elements upstream of the AP-1 site might also be important in regulating collagenase-1. Indeed, the AP-1 site, the polyoma enhancer A-binding protein-3 site (−91 to −83) and the “TTCA” element (−105 to −102) are also required for full PMA-mediated induction in fibroblasts (31Auble D.T. Brinckerhoff C.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4629-4635Google Scholar, 32Gutman A. Wasylyk EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Google Scholar). We assessed the requirement of the AP-1 site and more distal promoter sequences to collagenase-1 gene activation during and subsequent to monocytic differentiation. We used PMA-treated U937 cells as anin vitro model because they mimic the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages (33Harris P. Ralph P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 37: 407-422Google Scholar) and because activation of collagenase-1 expression in these cells occurs strictly by a transcriptional mechanism (27Saarialho-Kere U.K. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17354-17361Google Scholar, 34Shapiro S.D. Doyle G.A.R. Ley T.J. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4286-4292Google Scholar). We report that collagenase-1 promoter activity is induced and maintained in the absence of a functional AP-1 site. We conclude that although the AP-1 site is required to mediate strong collagenase-1 transcription, other upstream elements, including a newly identified CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBP-β) site, participate in achieving maximal and sustained PMA-mediated collagenase-1 transactivation in monocytic cells. U937 cells (35Sundstrom C. Nilsson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 565-577Google Scholar) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL 1593) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% low endotoxin fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), non-essential amino acids, l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For induction of cell differentiation, U937 cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/ml and exposed to 8 × 10−8m PMA (Sigma). Human skin fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing the same supplements listed above. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium phenol extraction method (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Conditions for Northern hybridization and washes were as described (27Saarialho-Kere U.K. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17354-17361Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized with a 2.2-kb human collagenase-1 (37Goldberg G.I. Wilhelm S.M. Kronberger A. Bauer E.A. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6600-6605Google Scholar), a 2.0-kb human c-fos(38vanStraaten F. Müller R. Curran T. Beveren C.V. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3183-3187Google Scholar), a 1.2-kb human c-jun (39Hattori K. Angel P. Beau M.M.L. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9148-9152Google Scholar), or a 1.3-kb rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogeanse (40Fort P. Piechaczyk M. El Sabrouty S. Danz C. Jeantner I. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Google Scholar) random-primed,32P-labeled cDNA probe. Filters were washed and then visualized by autoradiography. Transcription rates of specific mRNAs were measured using 2.5 × 107 isolated nuclei as described (41Pierce R.A. Kolodziej M.E. Parks W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11593-11599Google Scholar). Nascent RNA transcripts were isolated, and equivalent counts of 32P-labeled RNA were hybridized to denatured, gel-purified cDNA inserts slotted on nitrocellulose. As an indicator of total transcription, a 2.5-kb pair human Alu repeat fragment derived from the ε-globin gene (42Wu J. Grindlay G. Bushel P. Mendelsohn L. Allan M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1209-1216Google Scholar) was blotted as well. Fig. 1 shows maps of all collagenase-1 promoter constructs used in this study. pBLCAT2 contains the −105/+51 region of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter fused to a CAT reporter gene (43Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Google Scholar). pAPCAT2a is derived from pBLCAT2, and contains a tandem triplet of the collagenase-1 AP-1 site subcloned 5′ of the TK promoter. A plasmid containing the −2278/+36 region of the human collagenase-1 promoter (44Frisch S.M. Reich R. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Martin G. Goldberg G.I. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 75-83Google Scholar) was generously provided by Dr. Steven Frisch (La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA). To eliminate the possibility of transcriptional differences due to the vector backbone, all collagenase-1 promoter sequences were subcloned into pBLCAT2. The TK promoter of pBLCAT2 was removed during the synthesis of the collagenase-1 promoter deletion constructs (Fig. 1 A). The p-2278CAT, p-2278MCAT, p-511CAT, p-179CAT, p-95CAT, and p-72CAT vectors were generated by PCR as described (26Pierce R.A. Sandefur S. Doyle G.A.R. Welgus H.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1890-1899Google Scholar). Constructs p-2010CAT, p-1954CAT, p-1689CAT, p-1552CAT, p-1197CAT, and p-997CAT were made by digestion of p-2278CAT with BsaHI, HpaI,XmnI, EcoRV, BglII, orBamHI, respectively. The digestion products were blunted (when necessary) with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, further digested with XhoI, and the appropriate blunt/XhoI fragment was subcloned into blunted-HindIII/XhoI digested pBLCAT2. The internal deletion construct, p-1197Δ-997CAT, was created by cutting p-2278CAT with BglII and BamHI followed by ligation of the vector. Internal deletion construct p-2010Δ-1954CAT was created by recombinant, whole plasmid PCR (45Hughes M.J.G. Andrews D.W. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 188-196Google Scholar) using the 5′ (ATAgcatgcACCCTGGAAGAGTCTCAT) and the 3′ (CGCgcatgcCTATTAACTCACCCTTGT) primers (deleted/mutated sequences in lowercase). The PCR product was digested with SphI and ligated. The resultant construct was digested with HindIII and BamHI, and the HindIII/BamHI fragment was subcloned into HindIII/BamHI cut p-2278CAT. All PCR was performed with either VentTM or Deep VentTM DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to minimize unwanted mutations. All newly created plasmids were sequenced to verify that only the desired alterations were introduced during PCR steps. Sequencing reactions were done using a SequenaseTM Kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). Heterologous promoter constructs contain collagenase-1 promoter sequences upstream of −997 linked to the TK promoter. These were constructed by subcloning the BamHI/XhoI TK promoter fragment of pBLCAT2 into deletion constructs that had been digested with BamHI and XhoI. For example, p-2278CAT gives rise to p-2278TKCAT, in which −2278 is the most 5′ and −997 (at the BamHI site) is the most 3′ nucleotide of the collagenase-1 promoter fragment (Fig. 1 B). U937 cells (107 in 0.5 ml) were transfected with 5 μg of linearized pRSV-Neo and 50 μg of linearized pBLCAT2, pAPCAT2a, p-72CAT, p-511CAT, p-2278CAT, or p-2278MCAT. Cells were electroporated at 250 V and 600 microfarads in a 0.4-cm gap cuvette using a BTX 3000 electroporator (Biotechnologies and Experimental Research, Inc., San Diego, CA), placed on ice for 10 min, added to 9 ml of culture medium, centrifuged to pellet the cells, and plated in 10 ml of fresh medium. After 24 h, cells were shifted to medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml Geneticin® (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 2 weeks, G-418-resistant cells were subcloned by limiting dilution or maintained as a pooled population of clones in medium containing 200 μg/ml Geneticin®. To minimize insertion effects, two groups of stable clones, one consisting of 6 clones and the other of 12 clones, were pooled. Southern hybridization with 32P-labeled CAT cDNA was done on individual clones and demonstrated that incorporated DNA was roughly equivalent among clones (data not shown). U937 cells were transfected by a modification of the DEAE-dextran method essentially as described (26Pierce R.A. Sandefur S. Doyle G.A.R. Welgus H.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1890-1899Google Scholar,46Grosschedl R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1985; 41: 885-897Google Scholar). Human skin fibroblasts were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. After transfection, cells were allowed to recover for 24 h prior to treatment with PMA. After recovery, cultures were divided equally and cells were plated in medium with or without PMA. After transfection, cells were given fresh medium and allowed to recover for 24 h prior to treatment with PMA. Hirt extraction (47Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Google Scholar) and Southern hybridization with 32P-labeled CAT cDNA was done to determine transfection efficiency. At the indicated times, cells were harvested, washed, and lysed in 200 μl of 250 mm Tris, pH 7.8, by freeze-thawing. Lysates were incubated at 65 °C for 5 min and then cleared of debris by centrifugation. Equivalent amounts (25–100 μg) of cleared lysate, normalized to total protein (Bradford protein assay; Bio-Rad), were assayed for CAT activity using acetyl-CoA (Sigma) and [14C]chloramphenicol essentially as described (48Gorman C. Moffat L. Howard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Google Scholar). Reaction products were separated by thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography. Results were quantified by cutting and counting the appropriate spots from the chromatography plate. Relative induction was obtained by dividing percent acetylation of treatedversus untreated samples. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignamet al. (49Dignam J. Martin P. Shastry B. Roeder R. Meth. Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Google Scholar). The integrity of all nuclear extract preparations was assessed by determining the ability of proteins to bind a radiolabeled Oct-1 double-stranded oligomer (data not shown). Oct-1 protein binding was constitutive and, thus, served as an internal control. Only extracts without apparent protein degradation were used. For AP-1 studies, double-stranded oligomers containing either wild-type (GATCAAAGCATGAGTCAGACACCT) or mutant (GATCAAAGCAcccgggAGACACCT) human collagenase-1 promoter sequence were used as probes and competitors. For the binding analyses to the upstream region at −2010 to −1954, double-stranded oligomers containing collagenase-1 promoter sequence between −2013 to −1990 (TGACGTCTTAGGCAATTTCCTGTC), −1994 to −1968 (CTGTCCAATCACAGATGGTCACATCAC), and −1970 to −1947 (CACATGCTGCTTTCCTGAGTTAAC) were used as probes (1, 2, and3 in Fig. 10). Competition was done with oligomers 1, 2, or 3, wild-type (TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA) or mutant (TGCAGAgactagtcTCTGCA) C/EBP consensus oligomers (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or with a wild-type (AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC) NF-κB consensus oligomer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Double-stranded oligomers were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase or with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. Binding reactions and electrophoresis conditions were as described (26Pierce R.A. Sandefur S. Doyle G.A.R. Welgus H.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1890-1899Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of nuclear protein (5 μg) and probe counts were used in all reactions. Supershift reactions were identical to those described above, except 1 μg of appropriate antibody was added to the binding reactions after addition of the labeled probes and reactions were incubated overnight at 4 °C prior to electrophoresis. The pan-Jun, pan-Fos, and pan-C/EBP antibodies were c-Jun/AP-1[D], c-Fos[4–10G], and C/EBP-β[Δ198], respectively. The antibodies specific to c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, and C/EBP-β were c-Jun/AP-1[N], JunB[N-17], JunD[329], c-Fos[4], FosB[102], and C/EBP-β[C-19], respectively. All antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Equivalent amounts of nuclear proteins were prepared for electrophoresis by adding 1 volume of 2 × sample buffer and β-mercaptoethanol to 50 mm. Samples were boiled for 1 min and separated through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were equilibrated in 1 × transfer buffer (10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol, pH 11.0) prior to transferring to polyvinylidene difluoride paper. After transfer, membranes were blotted according to the procedures suggested by Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence. We reported that collagenase-1 transcription is induced in U937 cells at 16–24 h after exposure to PMA (34Shapiro S.D. Doyle G.A.R. Ley T.J. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4286-4292Google Scholar). We used various assays to more carefully examine the kinetics of this differentiation-dependent induction. Collagenase-1 mRNA was not detected in untreated U937 cells (Fig.2 A). By 12 h post-PMA, collagenase-1 mRNA was detected, increased by 24 h, and remained elevated at 48 h post-PMA. Nuclear run-off assays demonstrated that collagenase-1 transcription was detectable at 12 h of PMA differentiation and remained at a constant level thereafter (Fig.2 B). These observations demonstrate that the onset of collagenase-1 induction occurs earlier than reported previously (34Shapiro S.D. Doyle G.A.R. Ley T.J. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4286-4292Google Scholar). CAT activity conferred by the full-length collagenase-1 promoter construct (p-2278CAT) in transiently transfected, PMA-treated U937 cells paralleled the pattern of induction of the endogenous gene (Fig.2 C). Only slight background CAT activity was seen in untreated cells. By 4 h post-PMA, promoter activity was increased, and maximal and sustained levels of CAT activity were achieved by 8 h post-PMA. Consistent results were obtained in four separate experiments. A similar time course for induction of collagenase-1 promoter activity was observed in stable transformants (Fig.3, −2278). Full induction of the wild-type collagenase-1 promoter was detected at 6 h after PMA treatment, and the levels were maintained for up to 96 h (Figs. 2 Cand 3). These data indicate that events necessary for maximal induction of collagenase-1 are activated within 4–6 h post-PMA.Figure 3Collagenase-1 promoters containing wild-type or mutant AP-1 element are induced in stably transfected U937 cells. U937 cells were transfected with p-2278CAT or p-2278MCAT, and stable clones were selected and pooled. 107 cells of each population were treated with PMA for the times indicated, and CAT activity in cell lysates was assessed. For the lines containing the wild-type construct (−2278), CAT assays were done with 25 μg of total protein for 24 h (left) or 12 h (right). For the mutant construct (−2278M) lines, CAT assays were done with 100 μg of total protein for 24 h. For all constructs, results shown are representative data of three experiments each with both pooled populations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Stable transformants were created to determine if a functional AP-1 site is needed for collagenase-1 induction. The proximal AP-1 site in the −2278/+36 promoter fragment was replaced with a SmaI recognition site (Fig.1 A). Gel shift analysis with labeled mutant oligomer demonstrated that the mutated AP-1 site does not bind nuclear proteins (data not shown). In two groups of pooled clones, mutation of the AP-1 site (p-2278MCAT) eliminated the rapid (i.e. by 4–6 h) and strong transactivation observed with the wild-type construct (p-2278CAT) (Fig. 3). Between 0 and 8 h post-PMA, no CAT activity was detected in U937 cells stably transfected with the mutant AP-1 construct (data not shown). However, transcriptional induction of the mutant AP-1 collagenase-1 promoter was consistently detected at 16 h post-PMA (Fig. 3, −2278M). Although CAT activity expressed by −2278MCAT was much lower than that conferred by the wild-type promoter, the level of CAT activity was maintained for up to 96 h after PMA differentiation, similar to the sustained activity from the wild-type promoter (Fig. 3). Experiments with individual stable clones showed the same patterns of induction with both the wild-type and mutant promoters (data not shown). Southern hybridization demonstrated that incorporated DNA was roughly equivalent among stable lines (data not shown). PMA treatment stimulated activation of the wild-type collagenase-1 promoter in human skin fibroblasts (Fig.4, −2278). Basal activity of the wild-type collagenase-1 promoter was high in these cells, likely due to constitutive c-Jun expression (data not shown), but at 8 and 24 h post-PMA, CAT activity increased. Mutation of the AP-1 site eliminated the high basal activity seen with the wild-type collagenase-1 promoter (Fig. 4, −2278M). However, similar to that observed in differentiated U937 cells, p-2278MCAT conferred transcriptional induction in transiently transfected fibroblasts at 8 and 24 h post-PMA (Fig.4, −2278M). Thus, the collagenase-1 promoter can be transcriptionally induced by PMA in the absence of a functional proximal AP-1 element. Time matched controls incubated without PMA had the same level of CAT activity for p-2278CAT or p-2278MCAT as did the 0 h cells (data not shown). The kinetics of c-fos and c-junexpression were assessed by Northern analysis (data not shown). In contrast to the delayed kinetics of collagenase-1 induction (Fig. 2) and in full agreement with data from others (50Mitchell R.L. Zokas L. Schreiber R.D. Verma I.M. Cell. 1985; 40: 209-217Google Scholar, 51Mollinedo F. Naranjo J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 483-486Google Scholar, 52Sherman M.L. Stone R.M. Datta R. Bernstein S.H. Kufe D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3320-3323Google Scholar), c-fosand c-jun transcripts were detected as early as 15 min post-PMA, peaked between 1 and 2 h after PMA addition, and were sustained at low levels over the next 48 h (data not shown). Because c-Fos protein expression may not correlate with expression of its mRNA in U937 cells (50Mitchell R.L. Zokas L. Schreiber R.D. Verma I.M. Cell. 1985; 40: 209-217Google Scholar) and because its subcellular localization is regulated (53Roux P. Blanchard J.-M. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Jeanteur P. Piechaczyk M. Cell. 1990; 63: 341-351Google Scholar), we used an immunoblotting assay to detect Fos family proteins in nuclear extracts from untreated and PMA-differentiated U937 cells. c-Fos protein was detected in both 1- and 24-h post-PMA nuclear extracts using pan-Fos or c-Fos-specific antibodies (Fig. 5). The upward shift in the c-Fos band seen in the 24-h extract may be due to increased protein phosphorylation (54Abate C. Marshak D.R. Curran T. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2179-2185Google Scholar). While the presence of c-Fos in nuclear extracts at 1 h post-PMA was anticipated, the clear abundance of c-Fos protein in the 24-h extract was not. A previous report indicated that c-Fos protein could not be detected in PMA-differentiated U937 cells after 2 h of treatment (50Mitchell R.L. Zokas L. Schreiber R.D. Verma I.M. Cell. 1985; 40: 209-217Google Scholar). Because these authors immunoprecipitated metabolically-labeled protein from whole cell extracts, they may have underestimated c-Fos protein levels during periods of low c-Fos protein synthesis. We detected no FosB protein by immunoblotting nuclear extracts from untreated or PMA-treated U937 cells with a FosB-specific antibody (data not shown). Proteins distinct from c-Fos were detected by the pan-Fos antibody in the nuclear extract from untreated cells, but not in those from PMA-treated cells. The identity of these protei"

Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases (cGKs) 1The abbreviations used are: cGK, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; 8-pCPT-cGMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cGMP; PET-cGMP, β-phenyl-1,N 2-etheno-cGMP; 8-Br-PET-cGMP, β-phenyl-1,N 2-etheno-8-bromo-cGMP;R p-8-pCPT-cGMPS, R pisomer of 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-guanosine-3′-5′-cyclic monophosphoro-thioate; R p-8-Br-PET-cGMPS,R p isomer of β-phenyl-1,N 2-etheno-8-bromo-guanosine-3′-5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate; ISC, short-circuit current; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. play an important role in the signaling of various cGMP-linked hormones and neurotransmitters including nitric oxide (NO), natriuretic peptides, and guanylin (1Butt E. Geiger J. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 27-42Google Scholar, 2Vaandrager A.B. De Jonge H.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 157: 23-30Google Scholar). In mammalian tissues two types of cGK have been identified. Type I cGK, consisting of α and β isoforms, is more generally expressed and acts as a key regulator of cardiovascular homeostasis (1Butt E. Geiger J. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 27-42Google Scholar, 2Vaandrager A.B. De Jonge H.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 157: 23-30Google Scholar). In contrast, type II cGK was described originally as an intestine-specific form (3De Jonge H.R. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 14: 315-333Google Scholar). Molecular cloning demonstrated that cGK II is indeed a distinct gene product expressed predominantly in epithelial cells of the intestine (4Jarchau T. Häusler C. Markert T. Pöhler D. Vandekerckhove J. De Jonge H.R. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9426-9430Google Scholar), although its mRNA was also detected in kidney, bone, and brain (4Jarchau T. Häusler C. Markert T. Pöhler D. Vandekerckhove J. De Jonge H.R. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9426-9430Google Scholar, 5Uhler M.D. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 274: 2082-2086Google Scholar). Its widespread distribution in various areas of the brain suggests an important role of cGK II in NO/cGMP signaling in the central nervous system (6El-Husseini A. Bladen C. Vincent S.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2814-2817Google Scholar). In the intestine, cGMP is involved in the regulation of ion and water transport. It inhibits the uptake of NaCl and stimulates the secretion of Cl− by activating the cystic fibrosis trans-membrane conductance regulator, a Cl− channel that is mutated in CF patients (8Field M. Rao M.C. Chang E.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321 (, 879–883): 800-806Google Scholar, 9Vaandrager A.B. De Jonge H.R. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 26: 253-283Google Scholar). Guanylin, a small peptide derived from a larger precursor protein released luminally by intestinal epithelial cells, may function as the physiological activator of the cGMP-mediated signaling pathway in intestine by activating guanylyl cyclase C (10Schulz S. Green C.K. Yuen P.S.T. Garbers D.L. Cell. 1990; 63: 941-948Google Scholar,11Currie M.G. Fok K.F. Kato J. Moore R.J. Hamra F.K. Duffin K.L. Smith C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 947-951Google Scholar). Heat-stable enterotoxins secreted by various pathogenic strains ofEscherichia coli mimic the action of guanylin and elicit a severe secretory diarrhea by hyperactivating guanylyl cyclase C (8Field M. Rao M.C. Chang E.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321 (, 879–883): 800-806Google Scholar, 9Vaandrager A.B. De Jonge H.R. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 26: 253-283Google Scholar). Electrophysiological and immunolocalization studies have provided evidence for a key role for cGK II as a mediator of the cGMP-provoked intestinal Cl− secretion (12Markert T. Vaandrager A.B.

Walter U. Lohmann S.M. Poller W.C. De Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4195-4200Google Scholar). The critical role of cGK II in STa/cGMP-induced diarrhea was recently confirmed by pharmacological and gene disruption techniques (7Pfeifer A. Aszódi A. Seidler U. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Fässler R. Science. 1996; 274: 2082-2086Google Scholar, 15Vaandrager A.B. Bot A.G.M. De Jonge H.R. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 437-443Google Scholar). Sequence comparison and biochemical analysis revealed a large degree of similarity in the structural organization of cGK I and II (2Vaandrager A.B. De Jonge H.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 157: 23-30Google Scholar, 3De Jonge H.R. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 14: 315-333Google Scholar, 4Jarchau T. Häusler C. Markert T. Pöhler D. Vandekerckhove J. De Jonge H.R. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9426-9430Google Scholar, 5Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13586-13591Google Scholar). Both isotypes possess two cGMP binding domains on one polypeptide chain which is covalently coupled to a catalytic domain. Their N terminus contains an autoinhibitory region, one or more autophosphorylation sites, and a leucine zipper motif, and both proteins are devoid of hydrophobic trans-membrane domains. Despite these similarities, cGK II was shown to differ from soluble dimeric type I cGK in that it behaved as a membrane- and cytoskeleton-associated protein in intestinal brush borders and as a monomer following its solubilization and purification (3De Jonge H.R. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 14: 315-333Google Scholar). However, recombinant mouse brain cGK II was reported to be soluble and dimeric after expression in mammalian and insect cells (5Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13586-13591Google Scholar, 16Gamm D.M. Francis S.H. Angelotti T.P. Corbin J.D. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27380-27388Google Scholar). In contrast, recombinant rat intestinal cGK II was found to be tightly bound to the membrane after expression in similar cell systems (4Jarchau T. Häusler C. Markert T. Pöhler D. Vandekerckhove J. De Jonge H.R. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9426-9430Google Scholar, 17Pöhler D. Butt E. Meissner J. Müller S. Lohse M. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. Jarchau T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 419-425Google Scholar,18Vaandrager A.B. Ehlert E.M.E. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7025-7029Google Scholar), but its oligomerization state was not established. Furthermore, the K a values for cGMP and cGMP analogs of recombinant rat intestine cGK II purified from Sf9 cells (17Pöhler D. Butt E. Meissner J. Müller S. Lohse M. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. Jarchau T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 419-425Google Scholar) differed considerably from those of recombinant mouse brain cGK II, which contained an additional N-terminal histidine tag (16Gamm D.M. Francis S.H. Angelotti T.P. Corbin J.D. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27380-27388Google Scholar). Since rat and mouse cGK II have very similar sequences, are endogenously both membrane-bound in intestine, and are activable by similar concentrations of cGMP after expression in COS-1 cells (5Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13586-13591Google Scholar, 18Vaandrager A.B. Ehlert E.M.E. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7025-7029Google Scholar), the observed kinetic and structural differences among purified cGK II preparations may reflect artifacts of the expression system and/or purification rather than fundamental differences. To circumvent such potential artifacts, we characterized the oligomerization state of cGK II and its kinetic properties in an environment most relevant for its physiological functioning, i.e. intestinal brush border membranes. We also compared the stimulatory or inhibitory potency of various cGMP analogs toward cGK II in vitro, with their effects on Cl− secretion in rat intestinal epithelium, presumably a cGK II-mediated process (7Pfeifer A. Aszódi A. Seidler U. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Fässler R. Science. 1996; 274: 2082-2086Google Scholar, 9Vaandrager A.B. De Jonge H.R. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 26: 253-283Google Scholar, 12Markert T.

Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 437-443Google Scholar). We report here that the endogenous intestinal membrane-bound type II cGMP-dependent protein kinase exists as a dimer and displays a distinct activation profile with respect to cGMP analogs, which permits discrimination between cGK II and cGK I effects in physiological processes. Disuccinimidyl suberate was obtained from Pierce, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine was from Sigma. Polyclonal cGK II or cGK I antibodies, raised against recombinant cGK II or cGK Iβ expressed in E. coli, were prepared as described (12Markert T. Vaandrager A.B. Gambaryan S. Pöhler D. Häusler C. Walter U. De Jonge H.R. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 822-830Google Scholar). The cGK substrate peptide 2A3 (RRKVSKQE) and the Walsh inhibitor peptide (protein kinase A inhibitor-(5–24)-amide) were synthesized by D. Palm (University of Würzburg, Germany), and the cGMP analogs were from Biolog (Bremen). cGK I (primarily the Iα isoform; Ref. 13French P.J. Bijman J. Edixhoven M. Vaandrager A.B. Scholte B.J. Lohmann S.M. Nairn A.C. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26626-26631Google Scholar) was purified from bovine lung as described (19Walter U. Miller P. Wilson F. Menkes D. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3757-3762Google Scholar). Confluent HEK-293 or NIH-3T3 cells, stably transfected with cGK II (18Vaandrager A.B. Ehlert E.M.E. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7025-7029Google Scholar), were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped with a rubber policeman in buffer A (150 mmNaCl, 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 100 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin) and processed directly or frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. The cells were homogenized by brief sonication (three bursts of 3 s, peak-to-peak amplitude 15–20 μm), and a crude membrane fraction was prepared by centrifugation for 15 min at 20,000 × g. Membranes from HEK-cGK II cells were resuspended in buffer A (2–3 mg of protein/ml), and membranes from 3T3-cGK II cells (which had lower basal protein kinase activity in cGMP activation assays) were resuspended to 1 mg of protein/ml in buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). Non-vesiculated brush border caps were prepared from jejunum and ileum of male Wistar rats by vibration of everted intestine in hypotonic EDTA buffer and low speed centrifugation, essentially as described previously (20Vaandrager A.B. Bot A.G.M. De Vente J. De Jonge H.R. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 1161-1169Google Scholar), and were finally resuspended to 0.4 mg of protein/ml in buffer B. Brush border membrane vesicles were isolated from everted pig intestine by freeze-thawing, followed by Mg2+ precipitation according to Ref. 21Van Dommelen F.S. Hamer C.M. de Jonge H.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 771-778Google Scholar. cGK II was solubilized from HEK-cGK II membranes or pig brush border membrane vesicles by addition of 0.5 m NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 and subsequently purified by affinity chromatography on 8-(2-aminoethyl)-amino-cAMP-Sepharose as described (3De Jonge H.R. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 14: 315-333Google Scholar). Gel filtration was performed essentially as described (22Vaandrager A.B. van der Wiel E. Hom M.L. Luthjens L.H. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16409-16415Google Scholar) using Superose 6 HR 10/30 or Superdex 200 HR 10/30 analytical gel filtration columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated and subsequently eluted at 0.2 ml/min with 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Fractions of 400 μl were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting or protein kinase activity assays. For each experiment the column was calibrated using standards. Sucrose density centrifugation was performed with linear 7.5–25% sucrose gradients in the same buffer used for gel filtration (22Vaandrager A.B. van der Wiel E. Hom M.L. Luthjens L.H. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16409-16415Google Scholar). Apparent sedimentation coefficients (s w, 20) were calculated by plotting the distance from the top of the gradient against the position of the following standards: catalase (11.3 S), bovine serum albumin (4.9 S), and cytochrome c (1.9 S). The molecular mass (m) of cGK I and cGK II was calculated from: m = 6πηNas w, 20/(1 − υρ) where η = viscosity of medium, n = Avogadro's number, a = Stokes radius,s w, 20 = sedimentation coefficient, υ = partial specific volume, and ρ = density of the medium. We assumed υ for proteins to be 0.73 cm3/g (22Vaandrager A.B. van der Wiel E. Hom M.L. Luthjens L.H. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16409-16415Google Scholar). Purified pig cGK II was separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride ProblottR membrane. Pieces of membrane containing the 75- and 70-kDa forms of cGK II were cut out separately, and both protein fragments were N-terminally sequenced by automatic Edman degradation with a 473A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). For cross-linking, samples (2 mg of protein/ml) were incubated for 15 min at 0 °C in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA with or without 0.6 mm disuccinimidyl suberate. The reaction was stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and cGK II was analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was performed as described earlier (23Vaandrager A.B. Schulz S. De Jonge H.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2174-2179Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were detected after incubation with cGK II or cGK I antibody (1:3000) by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Corp.) and quantitated by densitometric scanning (Bio-Rad, model 620). Protein kinase activity was determined by incubation of the samples (4–10 μg of membrane protein in case of cGK II or 30 ng of purified cGK I provided with 10 μg of bovine serum albumin) at 30 °C for different times in 40 μl of 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 25 mmsodium β-glycerophosphate, 200 nm protein kinase A inhibitor, 0.1 mg/ml cGK substrate peptide 2A3 (RRKVSKQE; Ref. 17Pöhler D. Butt E. Meissner J. Müller S. Lohse M. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. Jarchau T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 419-425Google Scholar), 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and various concentrations of nonradioactive Mg-ATP and cGMP or cGMP analogs as indicated. The reaction was started by addition of 10-μl aliquots of the cGK II preparations to 30 μl of prewarmed incubation buffer and quenched by addition of 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. The samples were subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g. The pellet fraction was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for determination of the autophosphorylation of cGK II (3De Jonge H.R. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 14: 315-333Google Scholar), and 15 μl of the supernatant was spotted in duplicate on sheets of P-81 chromatography paper (Whatman). After 4 washes with 1% phosphoric acid the amount of label incorporated was quantitated with the Molecular Imaging System GS-363 (Bio-Rad). The phosphotransferase activity of cGK II as measured in intestinal brush border and 3T3 cell membranes and the activity of cGK I were linear with the amount of enzyme up to the concentration used in the kinetic study and with time up to 4 min in the presence of relatively high ATP concentrations (≥300 μm). However, in the presence of low ATP, the cGK II kinase activity started to deviate from linearity after 2 min. This nonlinearity was independent of the concentration of cGMP or cGMP analogs and apparently resulted from ATP depletion caused by the action of endogenous ATPases (data not shown). The K m of cGK II for ATP was therefore determined from 2-min incubations, whereas the kinetic parameters for the cGMP analogs were routinely determined on the basis of 4-min incubations. The latter condition resulted in similar kinetic values but higher signal to noise ratios in comparison with 2-min incubations. A 1-cm long segment of rat cecum was removed under light diethyl ether anesthesia. The muscle layers were stripped off by blunt dissection, and the mucosa was mounted in an Ussing chamber (0.3-cm2area exposed) for measurements of short-circuit current (Isc) across the tissue as described (24Veeze H.J. Sinaasappel M. Bijman J. Bouquet J. De Jonge H.R. Gastroenterology. 1991; 101: 398-403Google Scholar). Dose-response curves were obtained by cumulative additions of agonists or antagonists, and subsequent measurements of the plateau phase of the ISC reached 10–20 min after each addition. The values for EC50, IC50, and apparent K a (defined as the concentration required for half-maximal activation) were determined from dose-response curves fitted by the program Slidewrite.K m and Hill coefficients were calculated with the program Enzfitter. K i values were determined from Dixon plots at half-maximal concentration of agonist (cGMP), assuming a single site. The lipophilicities of cGMP analogs were determined by gradient reversed phase chromatography essentially as described (25Braumann T. Jastorff B.J. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 350: 105-118Google Scholar) and comparable to common log p values. Immunoblots demonstrated that recombinant rat cGK II solubilized from HEK 293 membranes was eluted from gel filtration as a single peak with a Stokes radius of 6.6 which is significantly larger than that of purified cGK Iα (5.1) eluted under the same conditions (Fig. 1 A and TableI). Velocity sedimentation analysis likewise revealed single peaks for cGK II and Iα with sedimentation coefficients of 6.8 and 7.2 S, respectively (Table I). From these hydrodynamic parameters the molecular mass of cGK II was calculated as 190 kDa, more than twice the monomeric mass of 87 kDa (4Jarchau T. Häusler C. Markert T. Pöhler D. Vandekerckhove J. De Jonge H.R. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9426-9430Google Scholar), indicating that cGK II most likely exists as a homodimer in solution. cGK II immunoprecipitation or purification by cAMP-Sepharose chromatography did not reveal any associated proteins that could falsify the mass determination (data not shown, Ref. 18Vaandrager A.B.

Data represent means ± S.E. of three experiments, ND, not determined. In previous studies cGK II purified from pig intestine was found to behave as a monomer in gel filtration and sucrose density sedimentation analyses, although kinase activity, not immunoblotting as above, was used for cGK II detection (3De Jonge H.R. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 14: 315-333Google Scholar). We therefore compared the hydrodynamic parameters of recombinant rat cGK II with those of native pig cGK II after purification. As shown in Table I, purification had no effect on the dimeric state of recombinant rat cGK II. However, purified pig cGK II was recovered in two major peaks after gel filtration as detected by immunoblotting (see Fig. 1 B). In the first peak, full-length cGK II (86 kDa) eluted at a position indicative of a dimer. Subsequently, 75- and 70-kDa cGK II fragments eluted at a position corresponding to a Stokes radius of 3.5 nm, similar to that found for monomeric cGK II previously (3De Jonge H.R. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 14: 315-333Google Scholar). In accordance with the previous study, most of the kinase activity (>90%) was recovered in the second peak (data not shown). The proteins in the second peak were identified by protein sequencing as C-terminal, proteolytic fragments of cGK II. The N-terminal sequences VPLDV and PPEF obtained from the 75- and the 70-kDa form, respectively, matched those of a 75-kDa cGK II fragment beginning at Val101 and of a 70-kDa fragment starting at Pro139 (4Jarchau T. Häusler C. Markert T. Pöhler D. Vandekerckhove J. De Jonge H.R. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9426-9430Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that cGK II dimerization could be an artifact of the solubilization process, we compared the oligomeric structure of cGK II in membranes with that of solubilized cGK II by chemical cross-linking. As shown in Fig. 2, addition of the cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate to pig brush border membrane vesicles or to membranes of HEK cells stably transfected with recombinant cGK II, either before or after solubilization, resulted in the appearance of a cGK II complex at the position of a dimer (170 kDa) in SDS-PAGE in all cases, indicating that cGK II is also dimeric in membranes. The additional cross-linked bands observed at 80- and 210-kDa positions may represent intrachain or multiple interchain cross-linked forms of cGK II. Non-vesiculated brush border caps freshly isolated from rat intestine were found to offer a suitable model for measuring cGK II activity in its native membrane environment. They are enriched in cGK II (0.5–1 μg of kinase/mg of protein; Refs. 3De Jonge H.R. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 14: 315-333Google Scholar, 21Van Dommelen F.S. Hamer C.M. de Jonge H.R. Biochem.

Furthermore, cGMP could stimulate the phosphorylation of exogenous substrate by brush border preparations to a similar extent (7-fold) as reported for purified recombinant cGK II (Fig.3; Refs. 16Gamm D.M.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 419-425Google Scholar). The apparent K m of membrane-bound cGK II for the substrate peptide 2A3 was found to be similar to that of cGK I (0.10 and 0.12 mm, respectively; data not shown). However, endogenous cGK II at saturating cGMP (10 μm) has a relatively high K m for ATP (0.40 mm) in comparison to cGK I (0.066 mm) (see Fig. 4 A). Moreover, ATP was observed to decrease the sensitivity of cGK II for cGMP. As shown in Fig.4 B, the apparent K a for cGMP shifted more than 10-fold, from 50 nm at 10 μm ATP to 560 nm at 1 mm ATP. A similar shift in the apparentK a for cGMP by ATP in the range of 10–100 μm was noticed in case of cGK I. In the following experiments we routinely determined cGK kinase activity in the presence of 300 μm ATP, since this condition ensured a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and was comparable with that used in similar studies characterizing purified cGK II (16Gamm D.M.

The animal FAS 1The abbreviation used is: FAS, fatty acid synthase. 1The abbreviation used is: FAS, fatty acid synthase. consists of two identical polypeptides, each carrying six enzymes and an acyl carrier protein, that are juxtaposed to form two centers for the synthesis of palmitic acid from acetyl- and malonyl-CoA (1Wakil S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4523-4530Google Scholar, 2Chang S.I. Hammes G.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 1990; 23: 363-369Google Scholar, 3Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Google Scholar). The iterative condensation of an acetyl moiety with successive malonyl moieties and reduction of the β-keto intermediates normally results in the formation of palmitic acid as the major product. Initiation of the series of condensation reactions necessitates the translocation of an acetyl moiety and subsequently seven malonyl moieties, from CoA thioester to the 4′-phosphopantetheine of the acyl carrier protein domain of the FAS. A single transacylase enzyme is responsible for translocation of both substrates, and intermediate formation of acyl-O-serine intermediates occurs at the same site (4McCarthy A.D. Aitken A. Hardie D.G. Santikarn S. Williams D.H. FEBS Lett. 1983; 160: 296-300Google Scholar). The employment of a common enzyme for the loading of both substrates has important consequences in terms of the kinetics of the FAS reaction sequence, since substrate binding to the transacylase domain is random and each substrate is a competitive inhibitor for the other. Thus, for synthesis to proceed efficiently, inappropriately bound substrates must be rapidly removed by transfer back to the CoA acceptor (5Stern A. Sedgwick B. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 799-803Google Scholar). This substrate sorting or “self-editing” process occurs extremely rapidly, with turnover numbers >100 s−1, and does not limit the rate of acyl chain assembly, provided an appropriate concentration of free CoA is available (5Stern A. Sedgwick B. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 799-803Google Scholar, 6Soulié J.-M. Sheplock G.J. Tian W.-X. Hsu R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 134-140Google Scholar). The chain initiation mechanism for FASs that consist of separate monofunctional proteins such as those of plants and most bacteria differs from that of their multifunctional counterparts in that acetyl and malonyl moieties are translocated from CoA by separate transacylases. Thus there is a direct transacetylation from CoA to the active-site cysteine of a unique ketoacyl synthase termed ketoacyl synthase III, which functions solely in the initial condensation reaction (7Tsay J.-T. Oh W. Larson T.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6807-6814Google Scholar, 8Jaworski J.G. Post-Beittenmiller D. Ohlrogge J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 981-987Google Scholar). In these systems, malonyl moieties are transferred to the 4′-phosphopantetheine of the acyl carrier protein by a monospecific malonyl transacylase. Recently, a crystal structure of the malonyl-CoA:acyl carrier protein S-malonyltransferase fromEscherichia coli has been reported (9Serre L. Verbree E.C. Dauter Z. Stuitje A.R. Derewenda Z.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12961-12964Google Scholar). However, the structural information did not provide an obvious rationale for the substrate specificity of the enzyme. We have adopted an alternative strategy to identify residues that play a role in promoting catalysis and in determining the substrate specificity of the malonyl/acetyl transacylase associated with the multifunctional FAS, for which no three-dimensional structure is available. Our rationale is first to identify from multiple sequence alignments conserved residues that might be candidates for specific roles in catalysis and then to examine the effect of mutating these residues. Using this approach, we have previously identified His-683 2The amino acid numbering is that for the full-length FAS. The malonyl/acetyl transacylase is the second functional domain, extending approximately from residues 429 to 815. 2The amino acid numbering is that for the full-length FAS. The malonyl/acetyl transacylase is the second functional domain, extending approximately from residues 429 to 815. of the rat FAS as playing an essential role in activation of the catalytic residue Ser-581 (10Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31749-31755Google Scholar). Only one other basic residue, Arg-606 in the rat FAS, is universally conserved in the transacylases associated with multifunctional and monofunctional forms of FAS and polyketide synthase (10Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31749-31755Google Scholar). Since all of these transacylases can utilize either malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA as a substrate, we hypothesized that this residue might facilitate substrate binding by interaction with the free carboxyl group of the malonyl or methylmalonyl moiety and that its replacement might compromise binding of these substrates. A corollary to this hypothesis predicts that, in the context of the malonyl-CoA/acetyl-CoA:acyl carrier protein transacylase, such a mutation would likely have no negative effect on acetyl binding. We report here the results of experiments designed to test this hypothesis. Acetyl-S-pantetheine was prepared by acetylation of pantetheine with acetic anhydride and removal of the acetic acid formed by extraction with diethyl ether. The sources of other materials used were reported previously (10Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31749-31755Google Scholar). Construction of the transacylase expression plasmid pET23a/388-MAT has been described previously (10Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31749-31755Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis based on the method described by Kunkel et al. (11Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar) was adopted to generate Arg-606 → Ala and Arg-606 → Lys mutants. Correct introduction of mutations and authenticity of the DNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids carrying the mutations were used to transformE. coli BL21(DE3) cells, and expression of the recombinant proteins was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. The recombinant transacylases were recovered from inclusion bodies and refoldedin vitro (10Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31749-31755Google Scholar, 12Rangan, V. S., Serre, L., Witkowska, H. E., Bari, A., and Smith, S. (1997) Protein Eng. , 10, in press.Google Scholar). The Arg-606 → Ala and Arg-606 → Lys mutant transacylases were incubated with malonyl-CoA (100 μm) at 0 °C for 1 h, and the amount of free CoA formed was determined as described earlier (10Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31749-31755Google Scholar). Transacylase activity was routinely determined at 0 °C using either [1-14C]acetyl-CoA or [2-14C]malonyl-CoA as the substrate and pantetheine as the model acceptor (10Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31749-31755Google Scholar). In some experiments acetyl-S-pantetheine was used as the acetyl donor and CoASH as the acceptor; the acetyl-CoA product was isolated and quantitated by high performance liquid chromatography on a C4 reversed phase column (Vydac) as described previously (10Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31749-31755Google Scholar). One unit of activity is the amount of enzyme catalyzing the utilization of 1 μmol of substrate/min. Transfer of medium chain acyl moieties from a pantetheine donor to a CoASH acceptor was determined by separating the substrates and products using high performance liquid chromatography. Wild type and mutant transacylases were incubated with 400 μm acyl-S-pantetheine thioesters and 1 mm CoASH in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 (50-μl volume), at room temperature for 1–15 min, depending on the activity of the preparation. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1.05 ml of buffer A (25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 5.4, 5% acetonitrile), and the mixture was immediately injected onto a reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography column (Intertsil Phenyl, 5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm, MetaChem, Torrance, CA) maintained at 45 °C. The column was washed with buffer A at 1.5 ml/min for 5 min followed by a three-step linear gradient: to 25% acetonitrile over 3 min, to 55% acetonitrile over 10 min, and to 80% acetonitrile over 2 min. The amount of acyl-CoA eluted was determined from the observed absorbance at 258 nm using decanoyl-CoA as the standard. Saturating concentrations of donor and acceptor substrates were employed, and the reaction rates were directly proportional to time and enzyme concentration. Protein concentration was calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm; 1 mg/ml transacylase gives an absorbance of 1.07. Arg-606 was mutated to Ala and Lys in the context of the independently expressed transacylase domain representing residues 429–815 of the rat FAS. The mutant proteins were expressed inE. coli, solubilized in urea, renatured, and purified. Purity of the preparations was estimated to be >95% by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.1 A). The molecular masses of the proteins were approximately 42 kDa, as predicted, and both mutant proteins were recognized by rabbit anti-rat liver FAS antibodies (Fig.1 B). Replacement of Arg-606 with Ala or Lys decreased malonyl transacylase activity by 99 and 91%, respectively, but increased acetyl transacylase activity by 6.6- and 1.7-fold, respectively (TableI). These results demonstrated clearly that Arg-606 is required for optimal transmalonylation but not for transacetylation.Table IKinetic properties of mutant transacylasesEnzymeMalonyl-CoAAcetyl-CoAAcetyl-CoA/ malonyl-CoA (k cat/K m)Specific activityk catK mk cat/K mSpecific activityk catK mk cat/K mmilliunits/mgs−1μms−1m−1 × 10−3milliunits/mgs−1μms−1m−1 × 10−3Wild type1,610 ± 381.2 ± 0.0081.9 ± 0.236302,680 ± 431.9 ± 0.063.9 ± 0.44900.78Arg-606 → Ala15 ± 1.90.01 ± 0.000516.2 ± 2.40.617,800 ± 104014.2 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.287,89013,100Arg-606 → Lys154 ± 5.30.12 ± 0.00081.3 ± 0.29924,530 ± 1953.4 ± 0.012.9 ± 0.051,17012.7All assays were performed at 0 °C with 3 mm pantetheine as acceptor. Open table in a new tab All assays were performed at 0 °C with 3 mm pantetheine as acceptor. Kinetic analysis of the mutant transacylases revealed that the K m for malonyl-CoA was increased 8.5-fold by the Arg-606 → Ala mutation but was relatively unaffected by the Arg-606 → Lys mutation. The value fork cat was lowered about 100-fold by the Arg-606 → Ala mutation and about 9-fold by the Arg-606 → Lys mutation (Table I). With acetyl-CoA as the substrate,k cat increased significantly as a result of both mutations, and the K m decreased slightly. As a result of the Arg-606 → Ala mutation, the calculated specificity constant (k cat/K m) of the transacylase was decreased 3 orders of magnitude with malonyl-CoA as the substrate but was increased almost 2 orders of magnitude with acetyl-CoA as the substrate. On the other hand, replacement of Arg-606 with Lys had a much less drastic effect on the properties of the enzyme: the specificity constant for malonyl-CoA was reduced <1 order of magnitude, whereas that for acetyl-CoA was increased about 2-fold. Thus, based on the calculated values for relative specificity constants, the selectivity of the enzyme for acetyl-CoA was increased >16,000-fold by the Ala mutation and 16-fold by the Lys mutation. To assess the possibility that the observed lower activity toward malonyl-CoA exhibited by the Arg-606 → Ala and Arg-606 → Lys mutant enzymes might be due to increased hydrolase activity, we measured the ability of these mutant enzymes to hydrolyze malonyl-CoA. However, the activity of all enzyme preparations was extremely low: wild type, 5.1 milliunits/mg; Arg-606 → Ala, 1.8 milliunits/mg; Arg-606 → Lys, 2.4 milliunits/mg. In the absence of a thiol acceptor, almost 80% of the transacylase can be acetylated in the case of both the wild type (10Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31749-31755Google Scholar) and Arg-606 mutant enzymes (see Table III). When the transacylase was incubated with equimolar amounts of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, again almost 80% of both wild type and mutant enzymes was acylated. Malonyl moieties accounted for 39% of the occupied sites in the wild type transacylase, but only 4 and 11% in the Arg-606 → Ala and Arg-606 → Lys mutant enzymes, respectively (see Table III).Table IIICompetition between acetyl and malonyl moieties in the formation of covalent acyl-enzyme complexesEnzymeSubstrates[1-14C]Acetyl-CoA[1-14C]Acetyl-CoA + malonyl-CoA[2-14C]Malonyl-CoA + acetyl-CoAfraction of enzyme radiolabeledWild type0.78 ± 0.0040.49 ± 0.01 (61%)0.31 ± 0.01 (39%)Arg-606 → Ala0.78 ± 0.040.74 ± 0.04 (96%)0.03 ± 0.002 (4%)Arg-606 → Lys0.73 ± 0.030.62 ± 0.04 (89%)0.08 ± 0.002 (11%)Wild type (3.1 μm), Arg-606 → Ala (2.1 μm), or Arg-606 → Lys (2.1 μm) transacylases were incubated at 0 °C for 2 min with either [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (100 μm, 54 Ci/mol) alone or with both acetyl-CoA (100 μm) and malonyl-CoA (100 μm) together.

Figures in parentheses indicate percent of the total acyl moieties bound to the enzyme. The surprising observation that the catalytic efficiency of the transacylase toward acetyl-CoA was actually increased by the replacement of Arg-606 with either Ala or Lys prompted us to examine the effect of these mutations on the ability of the enzyme to handle longer chain length acyl moieties. In these experiments, we used acyl-S-pantetheine thioesters of different chain lengths as substrates and CoASH as the acceptor. With acetyl moieties as the translocated species, the activity with CoA as the donor and pantetheine as the acceptor was about 1 order of magnitude higher than when pantetheine was the donor and CoA the acceptor (Table II). Under saturating substrate conditions, the wild type enzyme exhibited low medium chain transacylase activity, and the activity decreased as the chain length of the acyl moiety was increased from 8 to 10 carbon atoms (Table II). The Arg-606 → Ala mutant exhibited transacylase activity >3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the wild type enzyme. Replacement of Arg-606 with Lys had a less dramatic effect, increasing octanoyl and decanoyl transacylase activities approximately 2 orders of magnitude.Table IIEffect of replacement of Arg-606 on acyl chain length specificity of the transacylase activityAcyl donorAcyl acceptorSpecific activityWild typeArg-606 → AlaArg-606 → Lysunits/mgAcetyl-S-CoAPantetheine-SH36.7 ± 2.8138 ± 6.551.5 ± 1.4Acetyl-S-pantetheineCoASH3.49 ± 0.2518.8 ± 0.794.61 ± 0.15Octanoyl-S-pantetheineCoASH0.012 ± 0.00113.1 ± 0.431.87 ± 0.09Decanoyl-S-pantetheineCoASH0.0025 ± 0.0003211.9 ± 0.950.276 ± 0.016Dodecanoyl-S-pantetheineCoASH<0.000292.59 ± 0.26NDAssays were performed at 20 °C.

Arg-606 is positionally conserved in all transacylases that function in the substrate-loading reaction of fatty acid and polyketide synthesis, regardless of whether the enzymes are specific for malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA or possess dual specificity for acetyl- and malonyl-CoA. Conceivably, a conserved arginine residue might function to enhance catalytic activity by interacting with the substrate carbonyl, increasing its electrophilicity and promoting the nucleophilic attack by the active-site serine residue. Alternatively, by neutralizing the carboxylate anion of the malonyl moiety, the strongly basic guanidinium group could serve to anchor the malonyl moiety in the active-site pocket. If Arg-606 functioned in the first role, then it should participate in both the malonyl transacylase and acetyl transacylase reactions. Since mutation of Arg-606 negatively impacts only the malonyl transacylase activity, this scenario can be entirely discounted. The selective effect of Arg-606 mutation on malonyl transacylase activity is clearly most compatible with the second possibility, namely that this residue specifically forms a salt bridge with the free carboxylate group of the malonyl moiety. Since the arginine is also positionally conserved in polyketide synthases regardless of whether they preferentially utilize malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA, it is likely that this residue plays the same role in facilitating the binding of both malonyl and methylmalonyl moieties. Recruitment of a methylmalonyl or malonyl extender unit by the polyketide synthases is clearly regulated at the level of the transacylase as illustrated recently by transacylase domain-swapping experiments (13Oliynyk M. Brown M.J.B. Cortés J. Staunton J. Leadlay P.F. Chem. Biol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 3: 833-839Google Scholar). Nevertheless, malonyl- and methylmalonyl-specific transacylases share significant sequence similarity, and the structural basis for their different specificities has yet to be elucidated. The rate of acylation of the active-site serine residue by acetyl and malonyl moieties is too fast to be measured by conventional methods. Earlier quenched flow studies on the whole fatty acid synthase have yielded first order rate constants of ∼150 s−1 for acetylation of the active-site serine; however, even at equilibrium only about 50% of the serine sites were occupied (14Yuan Z. Hammes G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13532-13538Google Scholar). Somewhat higher stoichiometries for acylation of the isolated transferase domain were obtained in this study, approximately 0.8 mol of substrate/mol of enzyme. When both acetyl and malonyl moieties are offered simultaneously to the wild type transacylase, malonyl moieties compete effectively for binding to the active-site serine. However, in the Arg-606 → Ala enzyme, and to a lesser extent in the Arg-606 → Lys enzyme, the ability of malonyl moieties to compete with acetyl moieties is severely compromised (Table III). This finding is consistent with the proposed role for Arg-606 in facilitating the initial binding of malonyl moieties to the enzyme. Removal of the positive charge at residue 606 by replacement with a neutral alanine also had the effect of increasing the acetyl transacylase activity of the enzyme. Indeed the activity toward other uncharged and more hydrophobic acyl moieties was increased even more dramatically so that the acyl chain specificity of the Ala-606 mutant is extended to medium chain lengths. Replacement of Arg-606 with the less basic, slightly smaller Lys residue produced an enzyme with substrate specificity intermediate between wild type and Ala-606 enzymes. Thus, the Lys-606 enzyme exhibited increased activity toward acetyl and medium chain acyl substrates without completely compromising malonyl transacylase activity. The experiments described provide a rationalization for the ability of the FAS-related transacylases to catalyze the malonyl transfer reaction. Clearly, in the dual specificity malonyl-CoA/acetyl-CoA:acyl carrier protein S-acyltransferase associated with the multifunctional animal FASs, an additional residue, or residues, must serve to stabilize the acetyl moiety at the substrate binding site. We are presently attempting to identify these amino acids using the same strategy of combining sequence comparisons with mutagenesis experiments. The finding that a single amino acid replacement, for example Arg-606 → Lys, can effectively extend the acyl chain length specificity of the transacylase invites speculation as to whether such mutations may have occurred in nature. It has not escaped our attention that the ruminant FASs are able to release medium chain length acyl moieties as products by direct transfer to a CoA acceptor (15Knudsen J. Grunnet I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1808-1814Google Scholar, 16Hansen J.K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1980; 186: 287-294Google Scholar, 17Knudsen J. Grunnet I. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 139-143Google Scholar, 18Grunnet I. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 215-222Google Scholar). This transacylation reaction is catalyzed by the same transacylase domain of the FAS responsible for substrate loading (19Mikkelsen J. Hojrup P. Hansen H.F. Hansen J.K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 981-985Google Scholar). This unique property of the ruminant FASs has been attributed to the unusually permissive substrate specificity of the transacylase domain. On the basis of the results of our mutagenesis experiments, it is tempting to speculate that the broadening of the acyl chain length specificity of the ruminant FASs may have been achieved in evolution by a relatively simple mutational event. This possibility can be evaluated by comparison of the amino acid sequences of the transacylase domains of FASs from ruminant and non-ruminant sources. We are grateful to Dr. Andrzej Witkowski for providing the medium chain length acyl-S-pantetheine substrates and for helpful discussions. We thank Dr. Babak Oskouian for performing the photographic work."

The activity of the enzyme is regulatedin vivo by calcium signaling involving the binding of calmodulin (CAM), which triggers the activation of eNOS. We have examined the possible role of calcium-mediated CAM binding in promoting dimerization of eNOS through the oxygenase domain of the enzyme. A recombinant form of the oxygenase domain of human eNOS was expressed in a prokaryotic expression system. This recombinant domain contains the catalytic cytochrome P-450 site for arginine oxidation by molecular oxygen as well as the binding sites for tetrahydrobiopterin and Ca2+-CAM but lacks the reductase domain and associated FAD, FMN, and NADPH binding sites. Binding of Ca2+-CAM caused an association of monomeric eNOS oxygenase domain as determined by changes in fluorescence, both intrinsic and extrinsic, and by gel filtration, chemical cross-linking, and particle-sizing. Dimerization of the domain was not dependent on the presence of the substrate, arginine, or the cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin. A truncated form of the eNOS oxygenase domain lacking the Ca2+-CAM binding region did not undergo self-association to form dimers. These results show that the eNOS reductase domain is not required for Ca2+-CAM-induced dimerization of eNOS and suggest that this dimerization may be a primary event in the activation of eNOS by Ca2+.

These results show that the eNOS reductase domain is not required for Ca2+-CAM-induced dimerization of eNOS and suggest that this dimerization may be a primary event in the activation of eNOS by Ca2+. The family of nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs) 1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; eNOS, the constitutive endothelial isoform of NOS; nNOS, the constitutive neuronal isoform of NOS; iNOS, the inducible isoform of NOS; CAM, calmodulin; BH4, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. can be divided into two classes: those that are synthesized constitutively and activated by the binding of Ca2+-CAM (endothelial and neuronal isoforms) and those that are induced through the action of specific cytokines and endotoxin and possess tightly bound Ca2+-CAM (macrophage isoform). Calmodulin (CAM) is a calcium-activated regulatory protein of 148 amino acids that binds to and regulates a number of enzymes known to respond to changes in intracellular calcium levels (1James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Google Scholar). As a calcium-triggered switch, Ca2+-CAM recognizes specific basic, amphiphilic α-helical domains in target proteins to which it binds with high affinity (2O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Google Scholar, 3Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Google Scholar). The constitutive nitric-oxide synthases type I (neuronal (nNOS)) and type III (endothelial (eNOS)) possess these amphiphilic, helical regions (4Zhang M. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 981-985Google Scholar, 5Zhang M. Yuan T. Aramini JM. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20901-20907Google Scholar, 6Venema R.C. Sayegh H.S. Kent J.D. Harrison D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6435-6440Google Scholar) and are expressed as inactive apoenzymes that only become functional upon binding Ca2+-CAM. The inducible NOS (iNOS, type II) differs markedly in that Ca2+-CAM is so tightly bound as to become virtually a subunit of the iNOS monomer, thus obviating the need for calcium as a switch to turn on activity (7Persechini A. White H.D. Gansz K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 62-67Google Scholar, 8Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Google Scholar, 9Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc.

The activity of constitutive NOSs is regulated primarily by intracellular calcium levels through the binding of calcium-charged calmodulin. The mechanism(s) involved in this CAM-dependent activation are not known, but by analogy to other CAM-dependent enzymes could involve a conformational change, oligomerization, or both (14Babiychuk E.B. Babiychuk V.S. Sobieszek A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6366-6372Google Scholar, 15Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3772-3777Google Scholar, 16Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Johnson D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1875-1879Google Scholar). The active form of all isoforms of NOS appears to be the homodimer (8Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Google Scholar,17Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Robbins P.D. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11771-11775Google Scholar, 18Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27403-27406Google Scholar). Another common structural feature of the three isoforms of NOS is a bidomain structure comprised of an N-terminal oxygenase domain and a C-terminal reductase domain connected by a Ca2+-CAM binding region, which presumably facilitates electron transfer between the reductase and oxygenase domains (9Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Google Scholar, 10Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Google Scholar, 11Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J.

Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14631-14635Google Scholar). In the case of iNOS, subunit association is through the oxygenase domain and is dependent on BH4, arginine, and heme (8Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Google Scholar, 11Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Google Scholar, 12Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J.

Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Google Scholar). Neither the reductase domain nor the CAM binding region are required for dimerization. Dimerization of nNOS also is promoted by BH4 and requires heme (20Klatt P. Pfeiffer S. List B.M. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7336-7342Google Scholar). Dimerization of eNOS, in contrast, does not appear to be influenced by BH4 (26Rodriguez-Crespo I. Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11462-11467Google Scholar), and both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains may be involved in assembly (21Lee C.M. Robinson L.J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27403-27406Google Scholar). Thus, the dimerization of eNOS may be unique and may reflect differences in regulation because oligomerization is a possible mode of regulation for the NOSs. The functioning of calmodulin as the molecular switch for activation of eNOS has been known for some time but the potential role of Ca2+-CAM binding in homodimer formation has not been addressed. The bidomain structure of NOS permits the molecular dissection of the molecule into separate domains, which facilitates molecular studies aimed at establishing important structure-function relationships associated with the respective domains. To study the dimerization step of eNOS activation in relation to Ca2+-CAM binding, we utilized a prokaryotic expression system to generate the oxygenase domain of human eNOS, which contains the Ca2+-CAM regulatory domain, substrate and BH4 binding sites, and the catalytic heme binding site. Conformational changes in the recombinant oxygenase domain were observed as quenching or enhancement of fluorescence both from intrinsic sources (primarily tryptophan) and from extrinsically tagged (dansyl) CAM. Association of monomers separate from or concomitant with Ca2+-CAM binding was tested by gel filtration chromatography, chemical cross-linking followed by SDS-PAGE analysis, and light scatter particle sizing. Our results provide the first experimental evidence that Ca2+-CAM promotes dimerization of human eNOS through the oxygenase domain of the enzyme. A preliminary report of these findings has been published (27Hellermann G.R. Solomonson L.P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: A437Google Scholar). The human endothelial nitric-oxide synthase cDNA (28Janssens S.P. Shimouchi A. Quertermous T. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14519-14522Google Scholar) used in this study was the kind gift of Dr. Kenneth D. Bloch (Harvard Medical School). AnEcoRI-EagI fragment containing the N-terminal 1635 nucleotides of the coding region (NTF) was generated from this cDNA and included the catalytic and regulatory domains of the enzyme but not the flavoprotein reductase portion. The N-terminal oxygenase domain was cloned into pET23b (Novagen) to form the plasmid, pNTF, which was then transformed into the expression host,Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The recombinant peptide was verified as eNOS using an eNOS-specific monoclonal antibody (gift of Dr. J. Pollock, Abbott Labs). A truncated form of the NTF cDNA consisting of the first 1430 nucleotides, which deleted the CAM-binding region, was also generated and transformed into E. coliBL21(DE3) as plasmid, pNTFcm−. Recombinant BL21(DE3)-pNTF cells were grown to anA 600 of 0.5 to 0.6 in Luria broth, aminolevulinate was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and expression was induced by the addition of isopropylthiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. Incubation was continued for 6–18 h, after which cells were harvested and eNOS oxygenase domain was purified by a method adapted from McMillan and Masters (22McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Google Scholar). Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.01 vol of S buffer composed of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 7 μmpepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10% glycerol. Lysozyme was added to 1 mg/ml, and the suspension was allowed to stand on ice for 30 min. Cells were lysed by 3–6 min of pulsed sonication (Branson 450, 30 watts on 50% duty cycle) on ice, and the lysate was centrifuged for 60 min at 30,000 × g. The supernatant was mixed with 0.5 vol of calmodulin agarose (Sigma) containing 0.2 mg of calmodulin/ml of matrix equilibrated with S buffer. The supernatant and beads were mixed on a rotator at 4 °C for 2 h. The mixture was then poured into a column, washed with 50 column volumes of S buffer plus 0.2 m NaCl, and then washed with 50 column volumes of S buffer plus 0.5 m NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted in 20 ml of S buffer without CaCl2 and containing 5 mm EGTA. Peak protein fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon, 30k NMWCO), and further purified by Superose 12 gel filtration chromatography. Recombinant eNOS fractions were verified by Western blotting and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA reaction (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Recombinant protein from BL21(DE3)pNTFcm− was expressed and purified in a similar manner except that a histidine-binding nickel column was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen) to bind the expressed, polyhistidine-tagged fusion protein. All measurements were made at room temperature (21 °C) using a Jasco FP770 spectrofluorometer and a quartz cuvette with 3-mm path length. Extrinsic fluorescence was used to measure Ca2+-CAM binding to recombinant eNOS oxygenase domain. A dansylated derivative of calmodulin (Sigma) was used to provide the external fluor, and solutions were freshly prepared just before use. The extent of dansylation was calculated using the extinction coefficient, ε320 = 3400 mol−1cm−1 and found to be 0.8 mol dansyl group/mol CAM (29Kincaid R.L. Vaughan M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 557-604Google Scholar). Incubations were done for 10 min at room temperature in a 200-μl assay mixture of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.1 mNaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.3 mml-arginine, 10 μm BH4, and 1 μm dansyl-CAM. Longer incubation times did not produce any change in the reading. Excitation was at 345 nm with slit width of 10 nm, and emission was read at 480–500 nm with slit width of 5 nm. The recombinant eNOS oxygenase domain showed negligible emission under these conditions. Changes in fluorescent emission due to association with the recombinant protein were expressed as the percentage of change relative to dansyl-CAM alone after correcting for background fluorescence. For measurement of intrinsic fluorescence changes, purified eNOS oxygenase domain was incubated in the same buffer as used for extrinsic measurements with the substitution of CAM for dansyl-CAM. In experiments to measure spontaneous association, incubation was allowed to continue for 30 min. EGTA was present at a final concentration of 5 mm to block CAM binding. For assaying Ca2+-CAM-mediated changes, incubation was for 10 min. The measurements were done using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm with a slit width of 10 nm and an emission wavelength of 330 nm at a slit width of 5 nm. Calibration was done on buffer blanks. Baseline fluorescence for monomer was determined by heating the samples 10 min at 55 °C. Calmodulin lacks tryptophan, and tyrosine does not contribute significantly to the intrinsic fluorescence under these conditions. Changes in fluorescence emission intensity are expressed as the percent of change relative to the monomer value. Recombinant eNOS oxygenase domain was incubated in assay mixture (see recipe under “Fluorescence Measurements”) with or without calcium and sampled at various times or for 30 min with various concentrations of recombinant domain at room temperature. After incubation, the reactions were made 100 mm in phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), and cross-linking was done by incubating the samples for 1 h at room temperature with 0.1 mm dimethylsuberimidate (Pierce). Reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.7) to a final concentration of 1 mm. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For protein visualization, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. In some experiments proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose filters, and the eNOS oxygenase domain was detected using a specific antibody and an alkaline phosphatase-based colorimetric method (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of eNOS oxygenase domain were treated as described for cross-linking and analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Superose 12 sizing column (Pharmacia). The column was calibrated with protein molecular mass standards as follows: myosin, 205 kDa; β-galactosidase, 116 kDa; phosphorylase B, 97 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; and, ovalbumin, 47 kDa. An aliquot of eNOS oxygenase domain was incubated at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in 20 mmHepes (pH 7.4), 0.13 m NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.3 mml-arginine, 10 μm BH4 with or without 150 nm CAM for 10 min at 21 °C. Samples were analyzed using a DynaPro 801 Molecular Sizing Instrument (Protein Solutions, Inc., Charlottesville, VA). Bovine serum albumin was run as a standard. The domain structure of human eNOS is shown in Fig.1 with the cloned regions for NTF and NTFcm− indicated. The oxygenase portion of the enzyme contains the heme coordination site, the sites forl-arginine and BH4 binding, and the Ca2+-CAM regulatory region. Purification of the recombinant eNOS oxygenase domain was based on the use of CAM affinity chromatography, an extensively used and very effective method for isolating CAM-binding proteins (29Kincaid R.L. Vaughan M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 557-604Google Scholar). The expressed peptide had a molecular mass of about 60 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blotting. The yield of purified recombinant protein was approximately 0.5 mg/liter of cell culture. CAM-agarose affinity chromatography provides a nearly single-step purification of the recombinant protein from the bulk of bacterial proteins, few of which bind to CAM because the organism does not produce this protein. The fast protein liquid chromatography-purified recombinant protein is >90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis and has a reduced carbon monoxide spectrum characteristic of a cytochrome P-450-type hemeprotein (data not shown). Because the oxygenase domain alone is incapable of NO production, the “activity” of the recombinant eNOS oxygenase domain was defined in terms of its capacity to bind Ca2+-CAM and/or to undergo self-association. Binding of Ca2+-CAM to its target proteins or peptides may be determined with great sensitivity by using CAM to which a fluorescent moiety such as dansyl has been attached. Dansyl-CAM retains the physical and biological properties of native CAM, has virtually the same dissociation constants, and can be detected in the low nanomolar range (30Kincaid R.L. Vaughan M. Osborne Jr., J.C. Tkachuk V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10638-10643Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows spectra of dansyl-CAM under various conditions. Dansyl-CAM undergoes a large increase in fluorescent intensity and a blueshift from about 520–495 nm upon binding of calcium (compare spectra a andb). This can be explained by the known alteration in conformation of CAM when it binds calcium, which in this case results in a change in the environment of the dansyl moiety to a more hydrophobic state, increasing the quantum yield, and shifting the emission wavelength (30Kincaid R.L. Vaughan M. Osborne Jr., J.C. Tkachuk V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10638-10643Google Scholar). Addition of eNOS oxygenase domain (Fig.2 A, spectra c-f) to Ca2+-dansyl-CAM results in a further increase in fluorescent intensity and shift in wavelength of maximum emission to about 475 nm associated with the binding of Ca2+-dansyl-CAM to the recombinant oxygenase domain. Omission of the substrate for NOS, arginine, had no apparent effect on fluorescent intensity, whereas omission of the cofactor, BH4, appeared to slightly reduce the level of fluorescent intensity (data not shown). Both arginine and BH4 were included in the incubation mixtures to stabilize the recombinant oxygenase domain. Fig. 2 B shows titration of 0.1 μm dansyl-CAM with the recombinant oxygenase domain. The concentration that gave half-maximal change in fluorescence emission intensity was about 1 nm. The truncated recombinant domain, which lacks the CAM binding site, shows little or no enhancement of fluorescence emission intensity. The stoichiometry of binding of eNOS oxygenase domain to Ca2+-CAM is approximately 1:1 (Fig. 2 C). Measurements of changes in intrinsic fluorescence of recombinant eNOS oxygenase domain (Fig. 3), which under the parameters used reflect primarily tryptophan fluorescence, demonstrated a Ca2+-CAM-dependent quenching, suggesting a reorientation of the peptide to expose tryptophan residues to a more hydrophilic or charged environment. Some quenching also occurs after extended incubation (30 min) and at high (>100 nm) concentrations of recombinant oxygenase domain in the absence of Ca2+-CAM binding, which may be attributed to a spontaneous concentration- and time-dependent association of monomers. The omission of BH4 from the incubation mixture appears to slightly alter the extent of complex formation, but a transfer of fluorescent energy mediated by BH4 cannot be ruled out as a cause of the changed fluorescent intensity. Activation of eNOS is known to involve both Ca2+-CAM binding and homodimerization of the enzyme (21Lee C.M. Robinson L.J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27403-27406Google Scholar). To characterize the Ca2+-CAM-eNOS oxygenase domain complex implicit in our dansyl-CAM fluorescence enhancement results, we examined the association by gel filtration (Fig. 4) and particle sizing (Table I). In Fig. 4, aliquots of eNOS oxygenase domain were incubated with CAM in the presence (panel B) or the absence (panel C) of Ca2+ and then chromatographed on a size exclusion column equilibrated with the appropriate buffer. Peaks corresponding to both monomeric and dimeric forms were observed in the presence of Ca2+, indicating some instability of the complex under these conditions. In the absence of Ca2+ (+EGTA), there was a minor peak corresponding to a dimer, which was presumably due to the concentration- and time-dependent association of monomers observed in the absence of Ca2+. The elution volume of this minor peak corresponds to a lower molecular weight than the major peak observed in the presence of Ca2+ due to the absence of bound CAM. Fig.4 A gives the sizes of protein standards run under the same conditions. A standard curve of molecular mass versusretention was plotted by linear regression, and the sizes of eNOS oxygenase domain monomer and dimer were calculated as approximately 55 and 120 kDa, respectively.Table IQuaternary structure of recombinant eNOS oxygenase domainConditionApparent mass1-aApparent molecular masses were determined at 23 °C with a DynaPro 801 Molecular Sizing Instrument.kDaControl1-bThe control mixture contained 1 mg/ml of recombinant eNOS oxygenase domain in Hepes (pH 7.4) containing arginine, BH4, CaCl2, calmodulin, and dithiothreitol.149 ± 111-c95% confidence limits.Minus BH4150 ± 29Minus CAM80 ± 10Bovine serum albumin standard79 ± 31-a Apparent molecular masses were determined at 23 °C with a DynaPro 801 Molecular Sizing Instrument.1-b The control mixture contained 1 mg/ml of recombinant eNOS oxygenase domain in Hepes (pH 7.4) containing arginine, BH4, CaCl2, calmodulin, and dithiothreitol.1-c 95% confidence limits. Open table in a new tab To further test the self-association of eNOS oxygenase domain monomers as a function of Ca2+-CAM binding, we incubated the recombinant domain in the presence and the absence of Ca2+-CAM and measured complex size with a laser light scatter particle-sizing apparatus. The results, which are shown in Table I, indicate a complex of 149 kDa formed when Ca2+-CAM was present. This complex did not form in the absence of CAM but did form in the absence of BH4. The size of the complex would suggest association of two recombinant domains with two Ca2+-CAMs. This would agree with the 1:1 stoichiometry result seen previously. To determine whether the eNOS oxygenase domain undergoes self-association in the absence of calmodulin binding, increasing concentrations of recombinant domain were incubated in assay mixture without calcium (with 5 mm EGTA) and then subjected to chemical cross-linking and SDS-PAGE analysis. Fig. 5 A shows that spontaneous association can occur under these conditions but requires relatively high concentrations and longer times. Panel Bcompares rates of dimerization with and without binding of Ca2+-CAM. Whereas dimerization in the presence of Ca2+-CAM is essentially complete within 5 min, a substantial amount of monomer remained in the assay without calcium even after 60 min. Although some rearrangement in peptide conformation seems likely as a result of dimerization alone, it cannot be determined from these data exactly what the respective contributions of Ca2+-CAM binding and dimerization are to the molecular switch that turns on NOS activity. It seems clear, however, that Ca2+-CAM binding serves to promote association of eNOS subunits. The apparent spontaneous concentration- and time-dependent association of recombinant eNOS oxygenase domain monomers in the absence of Ca2+ may suggest that dimerization alone is not sufficient for the activation of eNOS. The activation of a number of enzymes is dependent on either oligomerization of the enzyme or on binding of an allosteric effector molecule such as calmodulin. In some cases, such as myosin light chain kinase (7Persechini A. White H.D. Gansz K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 62-67Google Scholar, 14Babiychuk E.B. Babiychuk V.S. Sobieszek A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6366-6372Google Scholar), erythrocyte Ca2+-ATPase (14Babiychuk E.B. Babiychuk V.S. Sobieszek A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6366-6372Google Scholar, 15Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3772-3777Google Scholar, 16Kosk-Kosicka D. Bzdega T. Johnson D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1875-1879Google Scholar), and the NOSs, both CAM-binding and oligomerization may be involved in enzyme activation. The role of calmodulin in promoting dimerization of eNOS may be unique to this isoform of NOS and could be a part of the signal transduction pathway that regulates NO production in endothelial cells. As pointed out by Lee et al. (21Lee C.M. Robinson L.J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27403-27406Google Scholar), the NOS isoforms share many features but have different physiological roles and appear to be regulated by different mechanisms. These authors suggested that oligomerization may be a possible mechanism for the modulation of NOS activity based on their results and those of others indicating that the active form of all NOS isoforms is a homodimer and that dimer formation is influenced by substrates and cofactors (8Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Google Scholar, 11Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Google Scholar, 12Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27403-27406Google Scholar). Ghosh and Stuehr (11Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Google Scholar) showed that the N-terminal oxygenase domain of iNOS participates in dimer formation and that this association is dependent on the cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin. This association did not require calmodulin. The dimerization of nNOS also appears to occur through the oxygenase domain, requires heme, and is stabilized by BH4and arginine (20Klatt P. Pfeiffer S. List B.M. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7336-7342Google Scholar). A possible requirement for calmodulin in the dimerization of nNOS was not addressed. Rodriguez-Crespo et al. (26Rodriguez-Crespo I. Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11462-11467Google Scholar), using recombinant bovine eNOS, reported that tetrahydrobiopterin was required for activity but did not appear to affect the extent of dimerization as determined by SDS-PAGE. An elegant study by Lee et al. (21Lee C.M. Robinson L.J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27403-27406Google Scholar) demonstrated that oligomerization of eNOS is important for eNOS activity in vivo. Their results suggested that both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains are involved in eNOS dimerization. However, the constructs used to produce the truncated N-terminal and C-terminal eNOS mutants contained overlapping sequences (residues 512–732 in the eNOS sequence), making interpretation of their results difficult. Some of this shared sequence (residues 512–545) is also contained in the recombinant eNOS oxygenase domain used in the present study. Our results clearly demonstrate that the binding of calmodulin to a recombinant oxygenase domain of human eNOS promotes dimerization and that the C-terminal reductase domain is not required for dimer formation. Our results also show that the substrate, arginine, and the cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin, are not required for eNOS dimer formation, in agreement with the the results of Rodriguez-Crespoet al. (26Rodriguez-Crespo I. Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11462-11467Google Scholar), but our results do suggest that tetrahydrobiopterin may stabilize the dimeric state of eNOS. These results are in contrast to the results reported by Stuehr's group, which demonstrated an essential role for tetrahydrobiopterin in the dimerization of iNOS (11Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Google Scholar). Thus, these two isoforms of NOS clearly differ in this regard. Interestingly, iNOS activity is not regulated by calcium signaling because calmodulin remains tightly bound to the enzyme (continuously activated). Because the calcium-dependent binding of calmodulin is required for the activation of eNOS, calmodulin-induced dimerization may play an important role in the modulation of the activity of this key enzyme in vasoregulation."

In the present work, phosphorylation and glycosylation sites were determined using mild proteolysis, peptide separation, microsequencing, and mass analysis by electrospray and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight techniques. Seven post-translational modification sites were detected. TwoO-linked glycosylation sites, each consisting of the trisaccharide NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAcα1, were located in the middle part of the protein, on Ser186 and on Thr231. The former residue is present in the antibacterial peptide named chromacin. Four phosphorylation sites were located on serine residues at positions Ser81 in the N-terminal region of the protein and Ser307, Ser372, and Ser376 in the C-terminal end. One additional phosphorylation site was found on the tyrosine residue at position Tyr173, the N-terminal amino acid of chromacin. With the exception of the phosphorylation on Tyr173, all of the other post-translational modifications are located on highly conserved chromogranin A regions, implying some biological importance.

In bovine adrenal medulla, secretory granules from chromaffin cells contain a complex mixture of secretory products, which include low molecular mass constituents such as catecholamines, ascorbate, nucleotides, calcium, enkephalins, and several water-soluble proteins. Among the latter, chromogranins/secretogranins a family of acidic secretory proteins, have been extensively studied. CGA 1The abbreviations used are: CGA, chromogranin A; ES/MS, electrospray mass spectrometry; LC/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. is the major member (40% of total soluble granule proteins) of this family, and these glycoproteins are expressed in a large number of endocrine and neuroendocrine cells and in neurons (1Simon J.P. Aunis D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 1-13Google Scholar, 2Helle K.B. Neurochem. Int. 1990; 17: 165-175Google Scholar, 3Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. Rosa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 27-30Google Scholar, 4Winkler H. Fischer-Colbrie R. Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 497-528Google Scholar). At the subcellular level, chromogranins are exclusively found in the soluble core of hormone and neurotransmitter storage vesicles and are released during exocytosis. Chromogranins have been proposed to play multiple roles in the secretory process. An intracellular function as a “helper” protein in the packaging of peptides, hormones, and neuropeptides by virtue of their ability to aggregate in the low pH and high calcium environment of the trans-Golgi network and as modulators of the processing of these components has been suggested (3Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. Rosa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 27-30Google Scholar). Extracellularly, different members of the chromogranin family are now considered as precursor proteins that are actively processed into peptides within the secretory granules (for reviews, see Refs. 1Simon J.P. Aunis D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 1-13Google Scholar and 5Dillen L. Miserez B. Claeys M. Aunis D. De Potter W. Neurochem. Int. 1993; 22: 315-352Google Scholar). Recently, we reported a detailed study of the intracellular and extracellular processing of CGA and chromogranin B in bovine chromaffin granules from intact gland and from cultured chromaffin cells (6Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 247-257Google Scholar, 7Strub J.M. Garcia-Sablone P. Lonning K. Taupenot L. Hubert P. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 356-368Google Scholar). The proteolytic processing of CGA is a topic of growing interest, since biological activities have been attributed to specific domains located along its sequence. For example, in the N-terminal domain, a peptide corresponding to the sequence 1–113 has been shown to inhibit hormone secretion in the bovine parathyroid gland (8Drees B.M. Rouse J. Johnson J. Hamilton J.W. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3381-3387Google Scholar); a homologous peptide, betagranin, corresponding to the sequence 1–115 has been isolated from rat pancreas, but its function has not yet been defined (9Hutton J.C. Davidson H.W. Peshavaria M. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 457-464Google Scholar). Vasostatins are peptides containing the N-terminal sequence 1–76/113 (10Helle K.B. Marley P.D. Hogue-Angeletti R. Galindo E. Aunis D. Small D.H. Livett B.G. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1993; 5: 413-420Google Scholar) and have been found to exhibit vasoinhibitory activity of isolated human blood vessels (11Aardal S. Helle K.B. Regul. Pept. 1992; 41: 9-18Google Scholar, 12Aardal S. Helle K.B. Elsayed S. Reed R.K. Serck-Hanssen G. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1993; 5: 405-412Google Scholar). As early as 1988, it was established that CGA is the precursor of a peptide that inhibits the secretory activity of chromaffin cells (13Simon J.P. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1712-1716Google Scholar). In addition, pancreastatin (248–293) is a peptide with multiple properties, since it negatively modulates insulin secretion from endocrine pancreatic islets (14Tatemoto K. Efendic S. Mutt V. Makk G. Feistner G.J. Barchas J.D. Nature. 1986; 324: 476-478Google Scholar, 15Efendic S. Tatemoto K. Mutt V. Quan C. Chang D. Ostenson C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7257-7260Google Scholar), amylase release from exocrine pancreas (16Ishizuka J. Asada I. Poston G. Lluis F. Tatemoto K. Greeley G. Thompson J. Pancreas. 1989; 4: 277-281Google Scholar), and acid secretion from parietal cells (17Lewis J.J. Goldenring J.R. Asher V.A. Modlin I.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 667-673Google Scholar). Another CGA-derived peptide, located in the C-terminal domain of CGA, parastatin (347–419), inhibits parathyroid cell secretion (18Fasciotto B.H. Trauss C.A. Greeley G.H. Cohn D.V. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 461-466Google Scholar). In addition to the autocrine or paracrine role in hormone secretion of these CGA-derived peptides, we have recently shown that numerous peptides with antibacterial activity are present as water-soluble components of bovine chromaffin granules and are released during secretion (7Strub J.M.

Metz-Boutigue M.H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 273-278Google Scholar, 20Goumon Y. Strub J.M. Moniatte M. Nullans G. Poteur L. Hubert P. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Eur. J.

For several antibacterial peptides derived from CGA and proenkephalin-A, structural features and more particularly post-translational modifications have been directly related to biological activity (20Goumon Y. Strub J.M. Moniatte M. Nullans G. Poteur L. Hubert P. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 516-525Google Scholar, 21Strub J.-M. Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Capon C. Lopez M. Moniatte M. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28533-28540Google Scholar). CGA is a single polypeptide chain of 431 residues, with an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa as estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a pI of 4.7–5.2 (6Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 247-257Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of bovine CGA (23Benedum U.M. Bauerle P.A. Konecki D.S. Franck R. Powell J. Mallet J. Huttner W.B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1495-1502Google Scholar, 24Iacangelo A. Affolter H.-U. Eiden L.E. Herbert E. Grimes M. Nature. 1986; 323: 82-86Google Scholar) indicates a real molecular mass of 48 kDa for the unmodified form of this protein. The difference between the apparent (70 kDa) and theoretical molecular mass (48 kDa) probably results from post-translational modifications (i.e. glycosylation, phosphorylation, and sulfation) and the abundance of acidic residues (25%) that cause a slower migration during electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (for a review, see Ref. 5Dillen L. Miserez B. Claeys M. Aunis D. De Potter W. Neurochem. Int. 1993; 22: 315-352Google Scholar). Previously, CGA has been described as a glycoprotein containing 5.4% carbohydrate (mass/mass), consisting of small glycan moieties (25Kiang W.-L. Krusius T. Finne J. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1651-1659Google Scholar); consensus sequences for N-glycosylation (NX(S/T)) are, however, not present in the primary structure (26Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Google Scholar). Furthermore, CGA has been described to be a phosphoprotein, with a ratio of five phosphorylated serine residues per protein molecule (27Settleman J. Fonseca R. Nolan J. Angeletti R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1645-1651Google Scholar). There is a modest incorporation of sulfate into CGA (28Falkensammer G. Fischer-Colbrie R. Winkler H. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 1475-1780Google Scholar), and it is bound toO-glycans and not to tyrosine residues (21Strub J.-M. Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Capon C. Lopez M. Moniatte M. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28533-28540Google Scholar, 29Rosa P. Hille A. Lee R.W.H. Zanini A. De Camilli P. Huttner W.B. J. Cell. Biol. 1985; 101: 1999-2011Google Scholar). Recently, using a combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, we described the oligosaccharide moiety to be present in CGA as trisaccharides including NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAcα1O-linked to a serine and/or threonine residue (21Strub J.-M. Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Capon C. Lopez M. Moniatte M. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28533-28540Google Scholar). Furthermore, studying the structural properties of new antibacterial CGA-derived peptides G- and PG-chromacin (CGA-(173–194)), the residue Ser186 was identified as an O-glycosylation site, and the tyrosine residue (Tyr173) was found to be phosphorylated. We also demonstrated that these two post-translational modifications are both necessary for the antibacterial activity of the CGA-(173–194) fragment. The present paper deals with the complete determination of the phosphorylation and carbohydrate binding sites of CGA from bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin granules. The strategy consists of characterizing the structure of modified phosphorylated andO-glycosylated peptides that were isolated after proteolytic cleavage of CGA with endoproteinase Lys-C. We have performed a detailed study using separation by reverse phase HPLC, chemical modification of phosphorylated peptides, and complete analysis by sequencing and mass spectrometry using electrospray mass spectrometry (ES/MS), liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Bovine CGA contains five phosphorylated residues located in four endoproteinase Lys-C-generated peptides (CGA-(173–194), CGA-(297–314), CGA-(78/79–109), and CGA-(331–420/421)) and two polysaccharide attachment sites linked to serine and threonine residues located within the CGA-(173–186) and CGA-(222–243) regions, respectively. The location of these sugar- and phosphate-rich peptides in the whole protein is specified in relation to the primary structure of bovine CGA. Sequence alignment of these modified peptides with CGA fragments of different species has led us to discuss these results in relation with phylogenetic features and specific physiological processing. Secretory granules were isolated from bovine adrenal medulla (30Smith A.D. Winkler H. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 483-492Google Scholar), and soluble proteins were separated from membranes after osmotic shock-induced lysis and high speed centrifugation (31Aunis D. Bouclier M. Pescheloche M. Mandel P. J. Neurochem. 1977; 29: 439-447Google Scholar). CGA was purified by reverse phase HPLC on a Macherey Nagel Nucleosil 300–5C18 column (4 × 250 mm; particle size 5 mm and pore size 100 nm) with the Applied Biosystems HPLC system 140 B as described previously (7Strub J.M. Garcia-Sablone P. Lonning K. Taupenot L. Hubert P. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 356-368Google Scholar). Then CGA (10 nmol) was digested for 2 h at 37 °C with endoproteinase Lys-C at a protein:proteinase weight ratio of 1000:1 in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. Generated peptides were then separated on a Macherey Nagel 300–5C18 column. Absorbance was monitored at 214 nm, and the solvent system consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 30% water, 69.9% acetonitrile (solvent B). Material was eluted at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min using, successively, a gradient of 0–25% B in A over 10 min followed by a gradient of 25–75% over 50 min. Each peak fraction was manually collected and concentrated by evaporation, but not to dryness. The sequence of purified CGA-derived peptides was determined in our laboratory by automatic Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 473 A microsequencer. Samples (100 pmol) were loaded onto polybrene-treated and precycled glass fiber filters (6Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 247-257Google Scholar). To identify phosphorylated residues, samples were modified with ethanethiol according to the method previously described (32Meyer H.E. Hoffmann-Posorke E. Korte H. Heilmeyer L.M.G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 61-66Google Scholar). Before sequencing, reagents were removed, using the ProSorb™ sample preparation cartridge (Applied Biosystems, division of Perkin-Elmer). ES/MS analysis was done on a VG Bio-Q quadrupole mass spectrometer (Fisons Bio-Q; VG Bio-Tech) with a mass range of 4000 Da and operating in the positive ion mode (33Jacquinod M. Potier N. Klarskov K. Reymann J.M. Sorokine O. Kieffer S. Barth P. Andriantomanga V. Biellmann J.F. Van Dorsselaer A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 893-903Google Scholar). The peptide was dissolved in water/acetonitrile/acetic acid (49/50/1; v/v/v) at a concentration of about 2–5 pmol/μl. Aliquots (10 μl) were introduced into the ion source at a flow rate of 4 μl/min. Scanning was usually performed from m/z = 500 tom/z = 1500 in 10 s with the resolution adjusted so that the peak at m/z = 998 from heart myoglobin was 1.5–2 wide on the base. Calibration was performed using the multiply charged ions produced by a separate introduction of horse heart myoglobin (16950.4 Da). In order to isolate and characterize glycopeptides, we have performed LC/MS analysis of CGA-derived peptides obtained after endoproteinase Lys-C digestion of CGA. Then, CGA (500 pmol) was digested for 2 h at 37 °C with endoproteinase Lys-C at a protein-to-proteinase weight ratio of 1000:1 in 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3. Then peptides were separated with an HPLC system (Applied Biosystems 140 A solvent delivery system) equipped with a UV detector (UV Waters detector 386) on a narrowbore Macherey Nagel Nucleosil 300–5C18 column (2 × 150 mm). Absorbance was monitored at 214 nm, and the solvent system consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (solvent B). Material was eluted at a flow rate of 250 μl using a gradient of 0–80% B in A over 80 min. A major part of the eluent (90%) was analyzed by UV detection, and an aliquot (10%) was measured by LC/MS (34Huddleston M.J. Bean M.F. Carr S.A. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 877-884Google Scholar). The mass spectrometer was calibrated under conditions using a mixture of polyethylene glycols (average masses 400 and 2000 Da). Spectra were scanned over m/z 320–1800 for 6 s, and the total ion current was recorded. This mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on a Brucker BIFLEX™ matrix-assisted laser time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with the Scout™ high resolution optics with an X-Y multisample probe, a gridless reflector, and the HIMAS™ linear detector. This instrument has a maximum accelerating potential of 30 kV and may be operated either in the linear or reflector mode. Ionization was accomplished with a 337-nm beam from a nitrogen laser with a repetition rate of 3 Hz. The output signal from the detector was digitized at a sampling rate of 250 MHz in linear mode and 500 MHz in reflector mode using a 1-GHz digital oscilloscope (Lecroy model). The instrument control and data processing were accomplished with software supplied by Brucker using a Sun Sparc workstation. These studies were realized according to the procedure previously described (21Strub J.-M. Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Capon C. Lopez M. Moniatte M. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28533-28540Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of bovine CGA sequences with corresponding fragments of CGA from different species was performed using the Clustal V multiple sequence alignment program (35Higgins D.G. Bleasby A.J. Fuchs R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 189-191Google Scholar). Chromogranin sequences were retrieved from the Swiss-Prot data base. In order to determine phosphorylation and glycosylation sites included within the bovine CGA sequence, the protein was purified according to the procedure previously described (21Strub J.-M. Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Capon C. Lopez M. Moniatte M. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28533-28540Google Scholar) and digested by endoproteinase Lys-C (see “Experimental Procedures”). The generated fragments were separated by HPLC on a reverse-phase C18 column. Our purpose was to identify peaks eluting at different times but containing peptides sharing identical peptidic sequences. The various elution times of these peptides indicated differences due to post-translational modifications. Taking into account these parameters, the chromatogram was divided into five regions from I to V (Fig.1). The four peaks present in region I corresponding to chromacin-derived peptides previously characterized as CGA-(173–194) (YPGPQAKEDSEGPSQGPASREK) (21Strub J.-M. Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Capon C. Lopez M. Moniatte M. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28533-28540Google Scholar). The N-terminal Tyr173 has already been identified as one of the phosphorylation sites (21Strub J.-M. Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Capon C. Lopez M. Moniatte M. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28533-28540Google Scholar). After automatic Edman degradation of peptide material recovered in peaks 1 and 2 of region III, we identified a major fragment with the sequence SGEPEQEEQLSKEWEDAK that corresponds to CGA-(297–314). To determine the post-translational modification of the more polar peptide (peak 1), comparative mass spectra analysis was performed by ES/MS (Fig. 2). Using the MacPro Mass program, the theoretical molecular mass of this peptide was estimated to be 2118.8 Da, corresponding to the experimental mass of the peptide recovered in peak 2. In contrast, the 2198.8-Da molecular mass of the peptide in peak 1 with a value of 2198.8 Da represents a difference of 80 Da, suggesting a phosphorylated serine residue, either Ser297 or Ser307. The material present in peak 1 was treated with alkaline phosphatase; this removed a mass of 80 Da, confirming the presence of a phosphate group. To identify which serine residue was phosphorylated, the peptide was submitted to the Meyer modification in the presence of ethanethiol prior to sequencing (32Meyer H.E. Hoffmann-Posorke E. Korte H. Heilmeyer L.M.G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 61-66Google Scholar). A phenylthiohydantoin-S-ethylcysteine was identified in position 307. Sequencing and mass spectra analysis of peak 1 material indicated the presence of an additional peptide corresponding to CGA-(60–70). The experimental molecular mass of 1185.3 Da corresponds to the theoretical molecular mass of the unmodified form of this peptide. Sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis of the material in the peaks of region IV revealed two groups of two peptides. After sequencing, the four peptides (numbered 1–4; Fig. 1) were identified as CGA fragments corresponding, respectively, to CGA-(78–109) (KHSSYEDELSEVLEKPNDQAEPKEVTEEVSSK) (peaks 1 and 3) and CGA-(79–109) (HSSYEDELSEVLEKPNDQAEPKEVTEEVSSK) (peaks 2 and 4). To characterize the structural differences between the peptides in peaks 1 and 3 and those in peaks 2 and 4, they were analyzed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 3). A theoretical molecular mass of fragments 78–109 and 79–109 was calculated to be 3662.9 and 3534.7 Da, respectively. Experimental molecular masses of peptides in peaks 2 and 4 fitted with these values, indicating that these were unmodified peptides. In contrast, the molecular mass of peptides in peaks 1 and 3 were evaluated to be 3741.63 Da and 3613.50 Da, showing an additional mass of 80 Da. CGA fragment 78–109 included seven potential phosphorylation sites (Ser80, Ser81, Tyr82, Ser87, Thr103, Ser107, and Ser108). Upon treatment with alkaline phosphatase, peptide 1 lost 80 Da, confirming the presence of a phosphate group. Location of the phosphorylated residue was determined after ethanethiol derivatization and microsequencing; a phenylthiohydantoin-S-ethylcysteine was identified in position Ser81. The first 23 amino acids of the major peptide (>90%) recovered in region V were sequenced as RLEGEEEEEEDPDRSMRLSFRAR. This sequence corresponds to the CGA fragment beginning at position 331 and results from a cleavage of the Lys330-Arg331 residues. Mass spectra analysis showed the presence of four molecular species with molecular masses of 2741.26, 7859.43, 10578.03, and 10677.50 Da (Fig. 4). The lower molecular mass may be assigned to the fragment 332–354, with a theoretical molecular mass of 2738.90 Da. We then focused on the higher molecular mass components. The calculated mass difference between 10677.50 and 10578.03 Da suggested the presence of a valine residue (99 Da) at the C-terminal end of the peptide. Taking into account the N-terminal sequence, the molecular mass, and the presence of C-terminal valine, we speculated that the CGA fragments 331–420/421 with calculated molecular masses of 10418.3 and 10517.5 Da probably correspond to the unmodified peptides eluting in peaks of region V. Comparing the experimental masses (10578.03 and 10677.50 Da) with theoretical values, a difference of 160 Da was obtained, suggesting the presence of two phosphorylated residues. Indeed, this fragment CGA-(331–420/421) possesses nine potential phosphorylation sites Ser345, Ser349, Tyr355, Ser372, Ser376, Tyr388, Ser398, Ser410, and Ser412. To characterize the two sites with post-translational modifications, a mixture of peptides 331–420 and 331–421 was treated with alkaline phosphatase. After this treatment, mass spectra analysis revealed the presence of two peptides with respective molecular masses of 10418.30 Da and 10517.30 Da instead of 10578.03 and 10677.50 Da. This observed mass loss of 160 Da confirmed the presence of two phosphate groups on both peptides. After tryptic digestion of the peptides 331–420 and 331–421, the two phosphorylated residues were identified. The generated peptides were separated by HPLC (Fig. 5), and their primary structure was determined from microsequencing and MALDI-TOF analysis (Fig.5 B). By comparing the experimental and calculated molecular mass of peptide CGA-(367–386) (2430.2 versus 2267.5 Da), the addition of 160 Da indicated the phosphorylated residues on this peptide. After derivatization of the GWRPNSREDSVEAGLPLQVR peptide with ethanethiol, it was unambiguously demonstrated that the phosphorylated residues were located in positions Ser372 and Ser376. Thus, the peptide with the experimental molecular mass of 7859.43 Da (Fig. 4 A) probably corresponds to the bisphosphorylated CGA fragment 357–421 (calculated molecular mass 7698.40 Da). The location of the observed phosphorylated residues of CGA along the CGA backbone are represented in Fig. 6. The present data indicate that (i) four of the phosphorylated residues are located on serines at positions Ser81, Ser307, Ser372, and Ser376, (ii) two of those serine residues at positions Ser81 and Ser307 belong to glutamic acid-rich sequences (SS81YEDELESEVLE and EPEQEEQLS307KEWE), (iii) one phosphorylation site is present on a tyrosine residue at position Tyr173, (iv) this phosphorylated Tyr173 is included in the proline-rich sequence LPSPKY173PGPQAKEDSEGPSQGP, (v) as far as can be determined with the technology used in the present work, there are no more than five phosphorylation sites per bovine CGA molecule. From structural properties of unmodified and modified CGA-(173–194) chromacin peptide, we have previously shown that bovine CGA contains at least one trisaccharide moiety with the NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAcα1 sugar sequence (21Strub J.-M. Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Capon C. Lopez M. Moniatte M. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28533-28540Google Scholar). G- and PG-chromacin (glycosylated and phosphorylated/glycosylated chromacin) are O-glycosylated peptides in which Ser186 is the residue to which the sugars are linked. To further characterize other glycosylated fragments present on CGA, the protein was digested with endoproteinase Lys-C and analyzed by LC/MS. In Fig. 7, the HPLC chromatogram (A), the single ion recording (SIR) of specific ions characteristic of glycosylation sites (B), and the total ionic current (TIC) of the chromatogram (C) are shown. InB, the presence of O-glycosylated peptides were recovered in peaks of regions I and II (Fig. 1). Analysis of region I has been previously reported with the characterization of G- and PG-chromacin (21Strub J.-M. Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Capon C. Lopez M. Moniatte M. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28533-28540Google Scholar). Sequencing of material included in the three peaks eluting in region II indicates the presence of a peptide corresponding to CGA-(222–243). Automatic Edman degradation of peak 3 (Fig.1 B) indicates that Thr231 was not detectable, suggesting an O-linked attachment site. To confirm this hypothesis, this peptide was analyzed by ES/MS (Fig.8 A). The data show three different molecular species with respective molecular masses of 2262.65, 2627.45, and 2919.45 Da. The molecular mass of 2262.65 Da might be attributed to the unmodified fragment CGA-(222–243), while the other species are likely to be the glycosylated forms of the same peptide (Fig. 8 B). The molecular masses of 2919.45 and 2627.45 Da corresponded, respectively, to the O-glycosylated peptide with the trisaccharide NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAcα1 moiety and to the disaccharide after the loss of terminal sialic acid. A schematic representation of bovine CGA showing the twoO-linked carbohydrate attachment sites Ser186and Thr231 located in the middle part of the whole protein is given in Fig. 6. The sequence in the vicinity of the serine residue Ser186 (PSQGP) fits with the two characteristic sequence patterns described by Wilson (36Wilson I.B.H. Gavel Y. Von Heijne G. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 529-534Google Scholar) for O-glycosylation sites. In contrast, the fragment 222–243 around threonine residue Thr231 is a proline-rich sequence (40%) but lacks of the Wilson consensus pattern. Chromogranins A and B occur in multiple secretory cell types of numerous species within the animal kingdom (1Simon J.P. Aunis D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 1-13Google Scholar, 37Rieker S.

Multiple neuroendocrine sources other than the adrenal medulla appear to contribute to the high basal circulating CGA concentration in man (1Simon J.P. Aunis D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 1-13Google Scholar). The widespread occurrence of CGA is indicative of some important biological roles for this protein. Despite the fact that CGA has been widely studied since its dis"

The initial results of retroviral gene transfer to cancer cells in malignant pleural effusions revealed that transduction was markedly inhibited, and studies to characterize the inhibitory factor(s) were performed. The inhibition was contained within the soluble, rather than cellular, components of the effusions and was demonstrated with amphotropic, gibbon ape leukemia virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein pseudotyped retroviral vectors. After excluding complement proteins, a series of studies identified chondroitin sulfates (CSs) as the inhibitory substances. First, treatment of the effusions with mammmalian hyaluronidase or chondroitinases, but not Streptomyces hyaluronidase, abolished the inhibitory activity. Second, addition of exogenous CS glycosaminoglycans mimicked the inhibition observed with pleural effusions. Third, immunoassays and biochemical analyses of malignant pleural effusion specimens revealed CS in relevant concentrations within pleural fluid. Fourth, proteoglycans/glycosaminoglycans isolated from the effusions inhibited retroviral gene transfer. Analyses of the mechanism of inhibition indicate that the chondroitin sulfates interact with vector in solution rather than at the target cell surface. These results suggest that drainage of the malignant pleural effusion, and perhaps enzymatic pretreatment of the pleural cavity, will be necessary for efficient retroviral vector mediated gene delivery to pleural metastases.

These results suggest that drainage of the malignant pleural effusion, and perhaps enzymatic pretreatment of the pleural cavity, will be necessary for efficient retroviral vector mediated gene delivery to pleural metastases. Malignant pleural effusions represent a terminal stage in a disease process for which only symptomatic therapy exists (1Broaddus V.C. Light R.W. Murray J.F. Nadel J.A. Textbook of Respiratory Medicine. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1994: 2145-2163Google Scholar, 2Sahn S.A. Clin. Chest Med. 1993; 14: 189-200Google Scholar); therefore, new therapeutic strategies, including gene therapy, appear warranted. We conducted a series of pilot experiments that compared the transduction efficiencies of adenoviral and retroviral vectors in various lung cancer subtypes and determined that when indexed to multiplicity of infection (infectious particles per cell), retroviral vectors are more efficient than adenoviral vectors in transducing lung adenocarcinoma cells (3Batra R.K. Hoganson D.K. Olsen J.C. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 153 (abstr.): A111Google Scholar). Because most malignant effusions from lung primaries result from metastatic adenocarcinoma, we focused upon retroviruses as the likely vector for this therapeutic indication. Malignant effusions are often bloody due to neovascularization and capillary leak associated with malignant cellular infiltration of the pleural surface. The fluid component of these exudative effusions is often turbid and viscous, reflecting the contributions of cellular debris and plasma proteins, as well as secreted proteoglycans (PG), 1The abbreviations used are: PG, proteoglycans; GALV, gibbon ape leukemia virus; VSV-G, vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein; RV, retroviral; LNPOZ, retroviral construct encoding neu and lacZ genes in the amphotropic or GALV pseudo-typed vectors; HIT-LZ, retroviral construct encodinglacZ in the VSV-G pseudo-typed vectors; FDG, fluorescein di-β-d-galactopyranoside; R10, RPMI medium with 10% fetal calf serum; M10, minimal essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum; RBC, red blood cell; BTH, bovine testicular hyaluronidase; S-Hya, Streptomyces hyaluronidase; CS, chondroitin sulfate; CSA, chondroitin 4-sulfate; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; AP, alkaline phosphatase; BSA, bovine serum albumin. their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) catabolites, and hyaluronic acid (2Sahn S.A.

Nabeshima K. Horai T. Hada T. Higashino K. Cancer. 1986; 57: 106-110Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycans are long unbranched polysaccharide chains composed of repeating disaccharide units, linking an aminosugar (typically sulfated) with a uronic acid residue (in all cases except keratan sulfate), which identifies the GAG chain as hyaluronic acid (nonsulfated), chondroitin (or dermatan) sulfate, heparin, or heparan sulfate. Except for hyaluronic acid, GAGs are found associated with a core protein as proteoglycans (6Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar, 7Lamberg S.I. Stoolmiller A.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1974; 63: 433-449Google Scholar). Preclinical studies testing gene transfer to primary cancer cells in native malignant pleural effusions indicated that cells in pleural fluid were poorly transduced by retroviral vectors when compared with cells in media. Since the target cells in these studies exhibited proliferation markers suggesting cell replication (a requirement for retroviral transduction), the inhibition to transduction was suspected to be due to components within the pleural fluid. To study the effect of pleural effusions on the transduction efficiency of retroviral vectors in vitro, target cell types that are highly transducible with amphotropic retroviral vectors were used. This report provides the identification of novel factors that inhibit retroviral transduction of cells in pleural fluid, a finding that may have relevance to the generally poor transduction efficiency observedin vivo using retroviral vectors. Mv1Lu cells, a mink lung epithelial cell line that is highly permissive for gene transfer by amphotropic RV vectors (30–70% of the cells are reproducibly transduced at multiplicities of infection of 1–5 (3Batra R.K. Hoganson D.K. Olsen J.C. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 153 (abstr.): A111Google Scholar)), were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (M10). H1437, a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line derived from intrapleural metastases; H28, a human malignant mesothelioma cell line; and H226, a human lung squamous cell carcinoma cell line derived from pleural metastases, were kind gifts from Dr. Herbert Oie at NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). These cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (R10). CFT1 cells (8Yankaskas J.R. Haizlip J.E. Conrad M. Koval D. Lazarowski E. Paradiso A.M. Schlegel R. Sarkadi B. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1219-C1230Google Scholar), a human bronchial epithelial cell line that is efficiently transduced by gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) and amphotropic retroviral vectors (9Olsen J.C. Johnson L.G. Wong-Sun M.L. Moore K.L. Swanstrom R. Boucher R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 663-669Google Scholar), were maintained in defined serum-free medium. Pleural effusions were harvested using aseptic technique from patients with a known or suspected pleurally based malignancy at the time of hospital admission. The effusion fluid used for this study was in “excess” of the specimen required for diagnostic purposes, and the experimental protocol was approved by the University of North Carolina Committee on the Protection of the Rights of Human Subjects. All effusions studied exhibited exudative characteristics, and the final diagnostic cytopathology suggested metastases from the following primary cancers: non-small cell lung cancer (seven), breast adenocarcinoma (three), ovarian cystadenocarcinoma (one), malignant thymic carcinoid (one), and parotid adenocarcinoma (one). The remaining five effusions had suspicious but nondiagnostic cytopathology, and data from these effusions were also included in the final analyses. Transduction studies using these effusions were generally performed within 60 min of their removal from patients, with whole (unfractionated) or effusion supernatants being used as vector diluents in transduction efficiency assays (see below). The cellular debris was removed from the effusions by centrifugation at 250 ×g for 15 min, and aliquots of the supernatants stored at −70 °C were later used for detailed characterization of the inhibitory factors. Complement was inactivated by heating the effusions for 1 h at 60 °C, and all enzymatic treatments of effusions were performed overnight at 37 °C on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm. All vectors used were based upon the Moloney murine leukemia virus. LNPOZ (10Adam M.A. Ramesh N. Miller A.D. Osborne W.R.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4985-4990Google Scholar) is a bicistronic retrovirus vector that uses a poliovirus internal ribosome entry site sequence to express both theneo and lacZ genes from a single mRNA. HIT-LZ 2J. C. Olsen, unpublished observations. is a lacZ-containing vector with an immediate early CMV promoter/enhancer fused to the retroviral R-U5 region in the 5′-LTR (11Soneoka Y. Cannon P.M. Ramsdale E.E. Griffiths J.C. Romano G. Kingsman S.M. Kingsman A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 628-633Google Scholar). Amphotropic LNPOZ was generated from the helper-free cell line PA-LNPOZ.1 (12Olsen J.C. Sechelski J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 1195-1202Google Scholar). LNPOZ, pseudotyped with the GALV envelope glycoproteins, was produced from PG.LNPOZ.21, a clonal producer line derived from PG13 cells (13Miller A.D. Garcia J.V. von Suhr N. Lynch C.M. Wilson C. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2220-2224Google Scholar). HIT-LZ, pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein, was transiently produced from 293 cells using the three-plasmid co-transfection system (11Soneoka Y. Cannon P.M. Ramsdale E.E. Griffiths J.C. Romano G. Kingsman S.M. Kingsman A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 628-633Google Scholar). Viral vectors were filtered through 0.2 μmcellulose acetate filters and stored at −70° until use. Prior to use, virus stocks were tested for the passive transfer of β-galactosidase (“pseudotransduction”) from virus producer cells (14Liu M.-L. Winther B.L. Kay M.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2497-2502Google Scholar) by analyzing cells for lacZ expression immediately following infection. Under these conditions, no β-galactosidase activity was detected in transduced cells. Ten ml of whole blood were collected in heparinized syringes from three healthy volunteers by venipuncture on three separate occasions. The RBC mass was measured in an aliquot of whole blood using a Coulter Counter (UNC Hospitals hematology laboratories), and RBCs were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient separation (Sigma). Following isolation, RBCs were co-incubated with the LNPOZ vector at hematocrits ranging from 0 to 15% for 30 min at 37 °C/ 5% CO2, following which the RBCs were removed by centrifugation (250 × g) prior to vector delivery to target cells. Cells were exposed to vector in 2 ml of vector containing (transduction) media in 3.5-cm tissue culture wells (Costar). Unfractionated (whole) pleural effusions, effusion supernatants, or modified effusion supernatant specimens (heated, enzymatically treated) were mixed with 1 ml of the LNPOZ vector to constitute 1, 10, or 50% of a final volume of 2 ml, with M10 and 8 μg/ml polybrene constituting the remainder of the volume. The control transduction medium, used to gauge the maximal achievable transduction in the absence of effusion factors, was 1 ml of vector stock admixed with 1 ml of M10. Target cells were transduced for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Following this interval, vector was aspirated, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, growth medium (M10) was added, the cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and cells were harvested 48 h later for transgene expression analyses. Transduction efficiency of RV-transduced cells was quantified using flow cytometry (FAC-Scan; Becton-Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems) by measuring intracellular FDG (Molecular Probes) hydrolysis. Briefly, cells were detached from the tissue culture plates (1% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA), sedimented (250 × g), and resuspended into 100 μl of growth medium. Next, the cells were loaded with FDG during a brief exposure to hypotonic shock (1 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm FDG in 1% Me2SO/H2O). FDG loading was terminated by the addition of 400 μl of ice-cold M10 containing 1 μg/ml propidium iodide. The cells were then placed on ice in the dark until fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, in which 16,000 viable cells were evaluated for β-galactosidase expression. Nonviable cells, defined as the population that had incorporated propidium iodide, were excluded in real time as red fluorescent cells. Negative (cells that were not exposed to the vector but were loaded with FDG) and positive (cells transduced in medium alone) controls were included in all experiments. Cells displaying green fluorescence exceeding the 99th percentile of the negative control population constituted the transduced cell population. The percentage of inhibition to transduction was calculated as (1 − (% of transduction of the test cell population − % of transduction of the negative control population)/(% of transduction of the positive control cell population − % of transduction of the negative control population)) × 100. If the test cell population exhibited a transduction efficiency greater than or equal to the positive control, the percentage of inhibition was reported as zero. Similarly, if the experimental population exhibited a transduction efficiency less than or equal to the negative control (i.e.≤1%), the data were reported as 100% inhibition. Alternatively, transduction efficiency of CFT1 cells bylacZ-expressing RV pseudotypes was quantitated by counting 200–400 cells following histochemical staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactoside (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) in three separate experiments (15Makarov, S. S., Olsen, J. C., Johnston, W. N., Schwab, J. H., Anderle, S. K., Brown, R. R., and Haskill, J. S. (1995) Gene Ther.424–428.Google Scholar). Hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate A (also referred to as CSA and chondroitin 4-sulfate), and chondroitin sulfate B (also referred to as dermatan sulfate) were derived from bovine tracheal mucosa (Sigma). Chondroitin sulfate C (also referred to as chondroitin 6-sulfate) was derived from shark cartilage (Sigma Biochemical). Each glycosaminoglycan was reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline (1 mg/ml), and transduction efficiency was measured following exposure of vector admixed with GAG at varying concentrations. In separate experiments, glycosaminoglycans (100 μg/ml) were preexposed to target cells for 2 h and aspirated off before LNPOZ infection. The concentration and conditions for the enzymatic digestion of pleural fluid were modifications of procedures used for the isolation of PG/GAG from synovial fluid, vitreous humor, and cartilage (16Couchman J.R.

Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1984; 25: 286-293Google Scholar). Excessive amounts of all enzymes were utilized because their relative activities in biological fluids is unknown. Bovine testicular hyaluronidase (BTH), a mammalian hyaluronidase (Sigma), and Streptomyces hyaluronidase (S-Hya), a bacterial hyaluronidase (Seikagaku Amano Pharmaceutical Company, Rockville, MD), were reconstituted in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0. Chondroitinase AC (Flavobacterium heparinum), and chondroitinase ABC (CABC) (P. vulgaris) were acquired from Sigma and reconstituted in 50 mm sodium acetate/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Heparinase (F. heparinum), heparitinase (F. heparinum), and keratanase (Pseudomonas sp.) were purchased as lyophilized preparations from Seikagaku and reconstituted in 50 mm sodium acetate/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Enzymatic treatments of pleural fluid were performed overnight at 37 °C, and retroviral transduction of target cells in the presence of treated or untreated effusions was compared. To evaluate the effect of BTH treatment on cell transduction, a variety of cell types were pretreated with various concentrations of BTH at 37 °C for 4 h prior to RV exposure. PG/GAG were purified from 10 ml of six effusion supernatants (representing a range of inhibition to retroviral transduction) by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 48 h) in a dissociative (4 m guanidine HCl) CsCl density gradient. Following ultracentrifugation, the tubes were snap frozen at −80 °C and cut into three equal aliquots. The recovered fractions possessed mean specific densities of 1.6 g/ml (bottom fraction, D1), 1.45 g/ml (middle fraction, D2), and 1.34 g/ml (top fraction, D3). These fractions were dialyzed (molecular weight cut-off of 3500) against distilled, deionized water at 4 °C for 2 days (five exchanges). Following dialysis, the fractions were lyophilized, and the PG/GAGs in each fraction were resolubilized in 10 ml of water. The uronic acid content in each fraction was quantitated by the modified carbazole method (23Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Google Scholar, 24Roden L. Baker J.R. Cifonelli J.A. Mathews M.B. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28B: 73-140Google Scholar), and the sulfated GAG concentration was measured by the dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay (25Chandrasekhar S. Esterman M.A. Hoffman H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 103-108Google Scholar). Estimates of the total hexuronic acid and sulfated GAG content in the effusions were made by adding the PG/GAGs isolated in the D1 and D2 fractions derived from each effusion. Next, the reconstituted D1 and D2 fractions were evaluated for their effect on RV transduction by infecting target cells with LNPOZ in the presence of the isolated PG/GAG. In addition, the D1 fractions isolated from each of three effusions were treated with a panel of enzymes that degrade an array of PG/GAGs to determine whether any of the observed inhibition could be abolished by this procedure. To size-fractionate the chondroitin PG/GAGs in malignant pleural effusions, 2-ml aliquots of Streptomyceshyaluronidase-treated effusions were gel-filtered through a 20-ml Sepharose CL-6B column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 4m guanidine HCl. Two-ml fractions were collected using 4m guanidine HCl, 50 mm Tris, and fractions containing chondroitin sulfates were identified with a dot blot immunoassay (see below). The void volume was determined by chromatography of blue dextran (approximately 2 million daltons; Fluka, New York), and the bed volume (salt peak) was determined by chromatography of the bromphenol blue dye (approximately 700 daltons; Sigma) from the column. Identification of PGs in pleural effusions was carried out by immunoassay utilizing murine monoclonal antibodies with specificity for CSA, chondroitin 6-sulfate, or sulfated GAGs. The 2B6 monoclonal IgG antibody specifically detects nonreducing Δ-unsaturated disaccharides of CSA, and the 3B3 monoclonal IgM antibody reacts with a nonreducing Δ-unsaturated disaccharides in chondroitin 6-sulfate (16Couchman J.R. Caterson B. Christner J.E. Baker J.R. Nature. 1984; 307: 650-652Google Scholar, 26Linhardt R.J. Galliher P.M. Cooney C.L. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1986; 12: 135-176Google Scholar) following chondroitinase treatment, which exposes the specific residues in native PGs. The 7D4 monoclonal IgM antibody recognizes a sequence of isomers with different sulfation patterns in native chondroitin sulfate (18Sorrell J.M. Mahmoodian F. Schafer I.A. Davis B. Caterson B. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 393-402Google Scholar). For these analyses, 100-μl aliquots of effusion supernatants, serially diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mmNaCl, 0.02% NaN3 (Tris-salt buffer, pH 7.0), were loaded onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.2-μm pore; Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) using a dot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) at room temperature. The membranes were blocked using 5% BSA in Tris-salt buffer for 2 h, treated with chondroitinase ABC (0.01 units in 0.1 mTris acetate, pH 8, for 1 h) to expose the epitopes for immunoassays using the 2B6 and 3B3 primary antibodies, washed with Tris-salt buffer, and incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody (1:1000 in 1% BSA). The 7D4 immunodetection was performed on native proteoglycans without chondroitinase treatment. Membranes were washed three times with Tris-salt buffer and incubated with the secondary antibody (1:7500 in 1% BSA, anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (AP)) (Promega, Madison, WI) for 1 h. After three additional washes, the dot blots were exposed to AP substrate (Promega) for 15 min and analyzed colorimetrically. Bovine nasal cartilage core was used as the positive control for detection of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (2B6 and 3B3 antibodies), and aggrecan from shark cartilage was used as the positive control for detection of sulfated GAG (7D4 antibody). Data are reported as means ± S.E. with the overall statistical significance of differences within the groups determined using one-way analysis of variance. Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance is initially performed on ranks, followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls or Bonferroni group comparisons. For Figs. 2 and3, the statistical significance of the difference between the treatedversus untreated groups was calculated using the two-tailed paired t test. For all statistical analyses,p < 0.05 was considered significant.Figure 3Comparison of the inhibition of amphotropic retroviral transduction by untreated pleural effusion supernatants, supernatants heated (60 °C for 1 h) to inactivate complement, or supernatants treated with bovine testicular hyaluronidase (250 units/ml BTH).

An approximate 75% inhibition of amphotropic retroviral transduction was observed when these effusions were admixed 1:1 with the retroviral vector-containing medium (Fig. 1 A). These initial observations suggest that there are factors inhibitory to amphotropic retroviral transduction contained within malignant pleural effusions and led first to studies to discriminate between the cellularversus soluble components as mediators of this effect. We postulated that the amphotropic retroviral receptor (RAM-1) (27Kavanaugh M.P. Miller D.G. Zhang W. Law W. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. Miller A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7071-7075Google Scholar) may be expressed in the RBC plasma membrane and bind the LNPOZ vector prior to its interaction with the target cell. However, when RBCs were coincubated with retroviral vectors in the range of hematocrits typically present in malignant pleural effusions (0–1.5%), only a small inhibition of transduction was detected (Fig. 1 B). At a hematocrit of 15% (RBC content one-third that present in blood), a 50% reduction in transduction efficiency was seen. Because RBC concentrations representing the maximal hematocrit in malignant pleural effusions (∼1.5%) could only account for a small component (<20%) of the overall inhibition exhibited by whole effusions, other factors are responsible for the majority of the inhibition to retroviral transduction. We next tested whether soluble factors within the effusions were blocking retroviral transduction. To test this hypothesis, cells and particulate debris were removed by centrifugation, and the effusion supernatants were evaluated in transduction efficiency assays. Fig.1 C shows a dose-dependent inhibition to retroviral transduction by the effusion supernatants in a pattern that is virtually identical to that observed with whole effusions (Fig.1 A). This observation suggests that the inhibition to retroviral transduction by malignant effusions is mediated by soluble factors present in the fluid component of those effusions. To investigate whether this finding was relevant to target cells other than Mv1Lu and to other candidate retroviral vectors, the inhibition to transduction in the presence of effusion supernatant was tested for and observed when the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line H1437 (68 ± 13.4% inhibition) was used as the target cell type. Next, using the human bronchial epithelial cell line (CFT1) as the target cells, transduction efficiencies of amphotropic, VSV-G, and GALV pseudotyped vectors were tested in the presence or absence of effusion supernatants. In the presence of effusions, amphotropic RV (LNPOZ) transduction is inhibited over a broad range of amphotropic vector concentration (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, as demonstrated in Fig. 2, B and C, the inhibition of RV transduction extends to the VSV-G and GALV pseudotyped vectors as well. Because recent reports have attributed the reduced RV transduction into target cells in the presence of human serum to complement-induced lysis of the retroviral vector (28Rother R.P. Squinto S.P. Mason J.M. Rollins S.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 429-435Google Scholar, 29Russell D.W. Berger M.S. Miller A.D. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 635-641Google Scholar), we first tested whether the observed inhibition to retroviral transduction was complement-dependent. Complement levels within the malignant pleural effusions were measured (C3 and C4 measured by rate nephelometry, and CH50 levels measured by complement-mediated sheep RBC lysis; UNC Hospital Labs) and did not correlate with the observed inhibition (data not shown). Furthermore, heating the effusions to inactivate complement components did not remove the block to transduction (Fig. 3). Malignant pleural effusions are often highly turbid and viscous, reflecting in part the contribution of secreted PG/GAG. To test an alternative hypothesis that proteoglycans block retroviral transduction, pleural effusion supernatants were treated with BTH, a mammalian enzyme with a broad activity against PG/GAGs (7Lamberg S.I. Stoolmiller A.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1974; 63: 433-449Google Scholar, 21Meyer K. Hoffman P. Linker A. in The Enzymes: Hydrolytic Cleavage.in: Boyer P.D. Lardy H. Myrbaeck K. Academic Press, Inc., New York1960: 447-460Google Scholar). A marked reduction in the inhibitory activity of the effusions was observed following BTH treatment (Fig. 3), implicating either hyaluronic acid or other PG/GAGs as the putative factors mediating the inhibition to retroviral transduction. A series of experiments were next performed to specifically identify the inhibitory glycoconjugates. First, effusions were pretreated with a more specific hyaluronidase derived from Streptomyces(S-Hya) (30Derby M.A. Pintar J.E. Histochem. J. 1978; 10: 529-547Google Scholar, 31Ohya T. Kaneko Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 198: 607-609Google Scholar) to test whether hyaluronic acid was responsible for the observed inhibition. As shown in Fig. 4, S-Hya, at a range of effective concentrations (19Dey P. Saphos C.A. McDonnell J. Moore V.L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1992; 28: 317-324Google Scholar, 22Knep"
https://openalex.org/W2030610074,"Accumulation of products of proteolysis (e.g. dipeptides) in lysosomes may have pathological consequences. In the present experiment we have investigated the existence of a dipeptide transporter in a membrane preparation of liver lysosomes using Gly-3H-Gln as the probe. The results showed that (a) there was transport of Gly-Gln into an osmotically reactive space inside the lysosomal membrane vesicles; (b) transport was stimulated by acidification (pH 5.0) of the external medium; (c) there was a coupling between transport of protons and Gly-Gln with a stoichiometry of 1:1; (d) the presence of both acidic pH and membrane potential was necessary for uphill transport of Gly-Gln; (e) a single transporter with a K m of 4.67 mm mediated the uptake of Gly-Gln; and (f) Gly-Gln uptake was inhibited by dipeptides and tripeptides but not by amino acids. The results suggest the presence of a low affinity proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter in the liver lysosomal membrane which mediates transfer of dipeptides from a region of low dipeptidase activity (intralysosome) to a region of high dipeptidase activity (cytosol). In this manner, the transporter provides an active mechanism for completion of the final stage of protein degradation. Accumulation of products of proteolysis (e.g. dipeptides) in lysosomes may have pathological consequences.

In this manner, the transporter provides an active mechanism for completion of the final stage of protein degradation. Lysosomes are major sites for protein degradation in the liver. Amino acids and dipeptides are the final products of proteolysis within this organelle (1Coffey J.W. de Duve C. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3255-3263Google Scholar, 2Kussendrager K.D. de Jong Y. Bouma J.M.W. Gruber M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 279: 75-86Google Scholar). These products must be exported into the cytosol if lysosomes are to retain their biological integrity. Failure to export may result in pathological consequences. This is evidenced by the genetic defect in the export of cystine, which results in accumulation of a high concentration of this amino acid in the lysosomes causing cystinosis. Cystinosis is a progressive systemic disease with many pathological expressions (3Gahl W.A. Schneider J.A. Aula P.P. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 3763-3797Google Scholar). Although as yet no genetic disease of dipeptide accumulation in lysosomes has been described, there is evidence that such an accumulation would also have pathological effects. This is evidenced by the osmotic protection experiments which determine the rates of release of lysosomal enzymes. Lloyd (4Lloyd J.B. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 245-248Google Scholar) showed that incubation of lysosomes isolated from rat liver with 0.25 m solutions of dipeptides or their constituent amino acids increased the release of their enzyme contents. Furthermore, the release was greater with dipeptides than with their constituent amino acids. He suggested that amino acids and dipeptides enter the lysosomes, and the entry is more efficient for dipeptides than for amino acids. Recently, Bird and Lloyd (5Bird S.J. Lloyd J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1024: 267-270Google Scholar) found that the rate of enzyme release was greater with dipeptides containingl-isomers than d-analogs, suggesting a stereospecificity in lysosomal permeation of dipeptides. However, as reviewed by Forster and Lloyd (6Forster S. Lloyd J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 465-491Google Scholar), the osmotic protection technique does not allow any conclusion regarding the mechanism which a solute uses for entry into the lysosomes. For example, the greater rate of enzyme release by dipeptides containing l- rather thand-amino acids could be explained by the hydrolysis of dipeptides within the lysosomes which is stereospecific (7Goldman R. FEBS Lett. 1973; 33: 208-212Google Scholar). This is consistent with a more recent study of Bird and Lloyd (8Bird S.J. Lloyd J.B. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1995; 13: 79-83Google Scholar) who found a positive correlation between ability of dipeptides to disrupt lysosomes and their susceptibility to hydrolysis by lysosomal enzymes. To determine whether the liver lysosomal membrane indeed possesses a dipeptide transporter, in the present experiments we have used a membrane vesicle uptake technique which has been validated for the studies of solute transport by the liver lysosomes. Jonas and Jobe (9Jonas A.J. Jobe H. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 41-45Google Scholar) showed that properties of rat liver lysosomal membrane, like the proton-pumping ATPase activity, are preserved in vesicle preparations. For the present experiment we used labeled glycylglutamine (Gly-Gln) as the probe because we have previously validated the use of this dipeptide for characterization of oligopeptide transport in membrane vesicles prepared from kidney and intestine (10Daniel H. Morse E.L. Adibi S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19917-19924Google Scholar,11Minami H. Morse E.L. Adibi S.A. Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 3-11Google Scholar). Adult male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats with body weights of 250–300 g were purchased from Zivic-Miller. Custom synthesized [glutamine-3,4-3H]glycylglutamine (49 Ci/mmol) was obtained from DuPont NEN. Amino acids, oligopeptides, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), 1The abbreviations used are: CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; LMV, lysosomal membrane vesicles; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. and acridine orange dye were purchased from Sigma. Filters (type HAWP, 0.45 μm pore size) were purchased from Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA. Rats were killed and their livers were removed for preparation of lysosomal membrane vesicles (LMV). Vesicles were prepared as described by Symons and Jonas (12Symons L.J. Jonas A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 382-390Google Scholar). Briefly, livers were homogenized in buffer 1 (250 mmsucrose, 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, with Tris base) containing 1 μg/ml pepstatin and 2 μg/ml leupeptin, using a Dounce homogenizer. The liver homogenate was suspended at an average protein concentration of 35 mg/ml in buffer 1 and centrifuged for 20 min at 750 × g. The nuclear pellet was discarded and the centrifugation was repeated. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer 2 (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, with Tris base) and recentrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g. The final pellet was suspended in 9 ml of buffer 2 and mixed with 11 ml of isotonic Percoll (1 ml of 2.5 m sucrose, 200 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.0, mixed with 9 ml of Percoll). The resulting Percoll mixture was centrifuged for 90 min at 40,000 × g. The dense brownish lysosomal band near the bottom of the gradient was removed and diluted with buffer 2 and centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g. The resulting pellet containing lysosomes was incubated in freshly prepared solution containing 5 mm methionine methyl ester, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm magnesium chloride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin for 15–20 min at 37 °C. Following this treatment, an equal volume of ice-cold isotonic Percoll was added. The mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 35,000 ×g. A dark brown band located at the top of this dense gradient containing purified LMV was removed and diluted in buffer 2 and centrifuged at 20,000 × g. The purified LMV pellet was resuspended in transport buffer sufficient to provide 3–5 mg/ml protein content. All of the above procedures were done at 4 °C. Protein content of the preparation was assessed with the Bio-Rad protein assay. The purity of the LMV preparation was investigated by determining enrichment of organelle and membrane marker enzymes. The activities of β-hexosaminidase, 5′-nucleotidase, cytochromec oxidase, and β-glucosidase in liver homogenate and vesicle suspension were measured by the methods described previously (13Barrett A.J. Dingle J.T. Lysosomes, A Laboratory Handbook. Elsevier, New York1972: 46-126Google Scholar, 14Hodges T.K. Leonard R.T. Fleischer S. Packer L. Methods in Enzymology. 32.

Uptake studies by LMV were performed at 23 °C using a rapid filtration technique as described previously (10Daniel H. Morse E.L. Adibi S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19917-19924Google Scholar). Gly-Gln uptake was initiated by mixing 20 μl of membrane suspension (preloaded with 100 mm KCl, 100 mmsucrose, 20 mm Hepes/Tris at pH 7.0) preincubated with 50 μm valinomycin and incubated with 180 μl of transport buffer containing 0.1 mm Gly-3H-Gln. Composition of the transport buffer varied with different experiments and is described in the figure legends. Incubation of vesicles was terminated by injecting 20 μl of vesicle mixture into 2 ml of ice-cold stop solution (same composition of the transport buffer but without Gly-3H-Gln), followed by filtration. The filters were then washed with 5 ml of ice-cold stop solution. The radioactivity associated with filters was counted in a Beckman scintillation spectrometer. Nonspecific binding of the Gly-3H-Gln was determined by adding the transport solution and vesicles directly to the respective ice-cold stop solution, followed by filtering, washing, and counting. Kinetic constants of Gly-Gln transport were determined by applying a nonlinear regression method to the Michaelis-Menten kinetic equation using GRAFIT (Sigma):V = (V max·[S])/(K m + [S])), where V is Gly-Gln uptake in picomoles per milligram of protein per 45 s, [S] is the external Gly-Gln concentration in millimolar, V max is the maximal Gly-Gln uptake, and K m is the concentration of [S] that yielded one-half V max. Each rate of Gly-Gln uptake, which was corrected for nonspecific binding, is given as mean ± S.E. of three replicates. Significant differences between values were determined by Student's t test. As shown in Table TableI, there was no enrichment of either cytochrome c oxidase (mitochondria) or 5′-nucleotidase (plasma membrane). In contrast, there was a more than 100-fold enrichment of a lysosomal membrane enzyme (β-glucosidase). Furthermore, there was only a modest enrichment of our preparation with a non-membrane-associated lysosomal enzyme (β-hexosaminidase).Table IActivities of marker enzymesEnzymeHomogenateMembrane vesicleβ-Hexosaminidase47 ± 9.50456 ± 49Cytochrome c oxidase1.91 ± 0.290.38 ± 0.145′-Nucleotidase2.42 ± 0.091.40 ± 0.14β-Glucosidase1.02 ± 0.07110 ± 14.2All values represent means ± S.E. of at least three assays.

To determine whether the observed Gly-Gln uptake by LMV was indeed transport into vesicles, the following experiment was performed. The rates of Gly-Gly uptake were measured as a function of medium osmolarity. Details of this experiment are presented in the legend to Fig. 1. The results showed that the rate of uptake decreased as a linear function of the reciprocal of medium osmolarity. Extrapolation of the data to infinite osmolarity showed no uptake, indicating the Gly-Gln was entirely or mostly transport into an osmotically reactive space. The data also indicate that the vesicles were properly resealed during preparation for uptake studies. To investigate the driving force for dipeptide transport we determined lysosomal uptake of Gly-Gln in the presence and absence of a sodium or a proton gradient. Details of these experiments are presented in the legend to Fig.2. As shown in this figure, the imposition of an inwardly directed sodium gradient (Na+concentrationout = 100, Na+concentrationin = 0) had no effect, but the imposition of an inwardly directed proton gradient (pHout5.0/pHin 7.0) transiently stimulated Gly-Gln uptake by LMV. During the initial 2 min of incubation all of the uptake values were significantly (p < 0.01) greater when the outside pH was 5.0 and the inside pH was 7.0 than when both pH values were 7.0. To investigate whether the above proton gradient indeed served as the driving force for Gly-Gln transport, the following experiment was performed. Prior to imposition of the proton gradient, the vesicles were preincubated with a proton ionophore (CCCP). As shown in Fig. 2, CCCP did not reduce Gly-Gln uptake by LMV, suggesting that the proton gradient was not the driving force in this case. To investigate whether membrane potential influences transport of Gly-Gln by the liver LMV, the following experiment was performed. The effect of K+-generated diffusion potential (inside negative) in the presence and absence of an acidic pH (5.0) in the transport medium was determined. The membrane potential was generated by replacing the KCl in the transport medium with 100 mmcholine chloride while maintaining the inside concentration of KCl at 100 mm. Results showed that imposition of membrane potential, when the pH of the transport medium was 7.0, transiently stimulated Gly-Gln uptake by the liver LMV (Fig. 3). All of the uptakes during the initial 2 min of incubation were significantly (p < 0.01) greater in the presence than in the absence of membrane potential. The stimulatory effect of membrane potential was greatly enhanced by acidification of the transport medium, resulting in a near 2-fold overshoot in transport of Gly-Gln at 2 min. Therefore, the presence of a membrane potential and an acidic pH was necessary for observing uphill transport of Gly-Gln. To investigate the affinity and the number of transporters involved in the uptake of Gly-Gln by membrane vesicles we investigated the rate of uptake as a function of dipeptide concentration. The rates of uptake by the liver LMV were determined in the presence of both a membrane potential and an acidic pH. Before this experiment, it was necessary to determine for how long the rate of Gly-Gln transport was linear. The results showed that for at least 50 s the rate was linear (data not shown); therefore, 45 s was chosen as the incubation time for the experiment detailed in the legend to Fig. 4. Eadie-Hofstee plot of data (Fig. 4) showed the presence of a single system for transport of Gly-Gln. The calculation of kinetic constants by the Michaelis-Menten equation showed a low affinity transporter with a K m value of 4.67 ± 0.80 mm and aV max value of 880.38 ± 3.81 pmol/mg protein/45 s. We used the fluorescent dye acridine orange technique to determine whether there is a coupling between proton and Gly-Gln transport. The results are shown in Fig. 5. There was a less than 5% change in the fluorescence when the liver LMV were added to the medium containing no dipeptide. The fluorescence change became appreciably greater (more than 11%) when the medium contained Gly-Gln. The results of the above experiment suggested that Gly-Gln and H+ are cotransported into the vesicles. To investigate the kinetics of this interaction, we investigated the effect of a range of pH on Gly-Gln transport (Fig. 6). There was a steady decline in the rate of Gly-Gln uptake by the liver LMV when the pH of the transport medium was increased above 5.0 (Fig. 6, right inset). There was a hyperbolic relationship between the rates of Gly-Gln uptake and H+ concentration (Fig. 6). The linearity of the Eadie-Hofstee plot of the data indicated a 1:1 stoichiometry between Gly-Gln and H+ uptake (Fig. 6, left inset). Calculation of the Hill coefficient also showed a coupling ratio of 1 (1.036 ± 0.152). Calculation of kinetic constants by the Michaelis-Menten equation showed a K m of 0.36 ± 0.02 μm(pKa = 6.4) andV max of 57.01 ± 1.43 pmol/mg protein/45 s. To investigate the substrate specificity of the transporter in the liver LMV, we determined the inhibitory effect of representative groups of amino acids, dipeptides, and tripeptides on Gly-Gln uptake. The results showed (Table II) inhibition by dipeptides and tripeptides but not by amino acids. Due to poor solubility of tetrapeptides at 30 mm concentration, the effect of these oligopeptides on Gly-Gln uptake was not studied.Table IICis inhibition of Gly-Gln uptakeSubstrate% uptakeControl (0.1 mm)100Gly-Gln0Glycine100Glutamine100Gly-Sar16Gly-Pro0Gly-Gly-Gly29Val-Ala-Leu0LMV were preloaded with 100 mm sucrose, 100 mmKCl, and 20 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.0) and preincubated for 30 min with 50 μm valinomycin.

The present study is the first step in the functional characterization of a peptide transporter in the membrane of liver lysosomes. The information obtained reveals that there are functional similarities between this transporter and those located in the brush border membrane of kidney and intestine (16Adibi S.A. News Physiol. Sci. 1996; 11: 133-137Google Scholar). For example, it is capable of uphill transport, it is stimulated by an acidic pH and membrane potential, its substrates include dipeptides and tripeptides but not amino acids, and it shows a 1:1 stoichiometry between cotransport of Gly-Gln and H+. The uphill transport may have been more pronounced if the membrane orientation of all the vesicles was inside-out. It has been shown (17Schneider D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1833-1838Google Scholar) that with the current technique of preparation, half of the LMV are oriented inside-out and the other half are oriented outside-out. The present results suggest that the driving force for uphill transport is membrane potential which normally exists in lysosomes (inside positive/outside negative). At the pH used in the present experiment (4.5–7.0) Gly-Gln is in zwitterionic form. Therefore, its uptake does not add any electrical charge to the transporter. On the other hand, binding of a proton adds a positive charge to the transporter, making it more available for the influence of membrane potential. The present results may provide an explanation for the disparity among the results of previous studies looking for the presence of an oligopeptide transporter in the liver. Lombardo et al. (18Lombardo Y.B. Morse E.L. Adibi S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12920-12926Google Scholar), using functional analysis, did not find any evidence for the presence of a dipeptide transporter in plasma membrane of rat liver. On the other hand, Fei et al. (19Fei Y.J. Kanal Y. Nussberger S. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Romero M.F. Singh S.K. Boron W.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 563-566Google Scholar), using Northern analysis, found expression of Pept-1 mRNA in the liver. In view of the present data, it is possible that the basis for a positive Northern analysis in the liver (19Fei Y.J. Kanal Y. Nussberger S. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Romero M.F. Singh S.K. Boron W.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 563-566Google Scholar) is the presence of an oligopeptide transporter in lysosomes. This suggestion is based on reports of a strong homology between genes encoding different oligopeptide transporters (20Boll M. Herget M. Wagener M. Weber W.M. Markovich D. Biber J. Clauss W. Murer H. Daniel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 284-289Google Scholar). We think that the physiological function of the transporter we have characterized in the lysosomal membrane is mainly to export rather than to import dipeptides because (a) previous studies have shown that the lysosomal carriers can be demonstrated by either uptake or efflux studies (21Mancini G.M.S. Beerens C.E.M.T. Verheijen F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12380-12387Google Scholar); (b) as already mentioned, the vesicles have both inside-out as well as outside-out orientations; and (c) it is generally believed that the conditions across lysosomal membranes are the determinant of solute flux. For example, the inside pH is highly acidic, while the outside pH is above neutral. As we have shown in the present study, these conditions greatly favor transport in the direction of cytosol. The K m of lysosomal oligopeptide transporter (4.67 mm) is considerably greater than the K m of lysosomal amino acid transporters, which ranges between 0.01 and 0.5 mm (6Forster S. Lloyd J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 465-491Google Scholar). Usually a greater K m is associated with a greater transport capacity. This may explain the efficiency of dipeptides over amino acids in causing the release of enzymes when lysosomes were incubated with these substrates in vitro (4Lloyd J.B. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 245-248Google Scholar). Finally, the present finding leads to a new concept in protein catabolism. Hydrolysis of proteins, whether in the gut lumen, renal tubules, or in liver lysosomes may result in production of considerable amounts of dipeptides (1Coffey J.W. de Duve C. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3255-3263Google Scholar, 2Kussendrager K.D. de Jong Y. Bouma J.M.W. Gruber M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 279: 75-86Google Scholar, 22Adibi S.A. Mercer D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 1586-1594Google Scholar, 23Stevenson-Stetler M.A. Flouret G. Peterson D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 241: F117-F122Google Scholar). However, the hydrolase activity against dipeptides as studied in the intestine (24Kim Y.S. Birtwhistle W. Kim Y.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1972; 51: 1419-1430Google Scholar, 25Nicholson J.A. Peters T.J. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 9: 349-354Google Scholar) is either totally or mostly located in the cell cytoplasm. Furthermore, rates of hydrolysis are much greater when dipeptides are incubated with liver homogenates than with liver lysosomes (26Bouma J.M.W. Scheper A. Duursma A. Gruber M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 444: 853-862Google Scholar). Therefore, oligopeptide transporters, whether located in the brush border or lysosomal membranes, appear to serve an important physiological function. They provide an active mechanism for transporting dipeptides from a region of low to a region of high dipeptidase activity. In this manner, they participate in completion of the final stage of protein degradation."

Nadeau K. Bradley M. Walsh C. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Google Scholar). Trypanothione (N 1,N 8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine; TSH) is a metabolite unique to trypanosomatids such asTrypanosoma sp., Leishmania sp., andCrithidia fasciculata (2Shim H. Fairlamb A.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 807-817Google Scholar). These parasites comprise pathogens causing widespread and difficult to treat tropical diseases such as African sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma brucei gambiense or Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense), Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), kala azar (Leishmania donovani), oriental sore (Leishmania tropica), and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (Leishmania braziliensis). Others (e.g. Trypanosoma congolense) affect domestic animals, whereas C. fasciculata is pathogenic to insects only. Since the discovery of TSH in 1985 (3Fairlamb A.H. Blackburn P. Ulrich P. Chait B.T. Cerami A. Science. 1985; 227: 1485-1487Google Scholar, 4Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 14: 187-198Google Scholar), the pathways for its synthesis and utilization have attracted considerable interest as potential targets for selective therapeutic intervention (5Schirmer R.H. Müller J.G. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Ang. Chemie (Int. Ed.). 1995; 34: 141-154Google Scholar, 6Fairlamb A. H Biochemist. 1996: 11-16Google Scholar). In all trypanosomatids, TSH substitutes for GSH in the defense against hydroperoxides and derived reactive oxygen species because of its ability to reduce peroxides either enzymatically (7Penketh P.G. Klein R.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 20: 111-121Google Scholar, 8Penketh P.G. Kennedy W.P.K. Patton C.L. Sartorelli A.C. FEBS Lett. 1987; 2: 427-431Google Scholar, 9Henderson G.B. Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 24: 39-45Google Scholar) or spontaneously (10Carnieri E.G.S. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 79-86Google Scholar). It thereby protects the parasitic trypanosomatids, which apparently are deficient in catalase and glutathione peroxidases (11Boveris A. Sies H. Martino E.E. Docampo R. Turrens J.F. Stoppani A.O.M. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 643-648Google Scholar), against oxidative stress for instance during host-defense reactions (9Henderson G.B. Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 24: 39-45Google Scholar, 12Babior B.M. Kipnes R.S. Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 741-744Google Scholar, 13Klebanoff S.J. Rosen H. Oxygen Free Radicals and Tissue Damage. Ciba Foundation Symposia 65 Exepta Medica, Amsterdam1979: 263-284Google Scholar). Trypanothione disulfide thus formed is reduced by the NADPH-dependent trypanothione reductase (14Krauth-Siegel R.L. Schöneck R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1138-1146Google Scholar, 15Bailey S. Smith K. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 67-75Google Scholar), a flavoprotein homologous to glutathione reductase that, together with glutathione peroxidases (16Flohé L. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic A. Glutathione: Chemical, Biochemical, and Medical Aspects. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989: 643-731Google Scholar, 17Ursini F. Maiorino M. Brigelius-Flohé R. Aumann K.D. Roveri A. Schomburg D. Flohé L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Google Scholar), constitutes a major part of the defense system of the host (18Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Google Scholar, 19Flohé L. Giertz H. Beckmann R. Bonta L. Bray M.A. Parnham M.J. Handbook of Inflammation. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1985: 255-281Google Scholar). The precursor of TSH, Gsp, may have a distinct biological role. It was first identified inEscherichia coli (20Tabor H. Tabor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2648-2654Google Scholar), where it remains unprocessed to TSH due to the apparent lack of TSH synthetase. In E. coli, GspS, and consequently Gsp, is prominent in the stationary phase (20Tabor H. Tabor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2648-2654Google Scholar,21Smith K. Borges A. Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 465-469Google Scholar). Similarly, in C. fasciculata, Gsp increases substantially during the transition from growth phase to stationary phase, while TSH simultaneously drops (22Henderson G.B. Yamaguchi M. Novoa L. Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3924-3929Google Scholar). These fluctuations of GSH conjugates or the associated variations in cellular spermidine levels have tentatively been implicated in growth regulation (2Shim H. Fairlamb A.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 807-817Google Scholar,20Tabor H. Tabor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2648-2654Google Scholar, 21Smith K. Borges A. Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 465-469Google Scholar). The first enzyme of TSH synthesis, GspS, has been isolated once in trace amounts from C. fasciculata (0.5 mg from 500 g, wet cell mass) and preliminarily characterized in terms of the apparentM r, kinetic parameters, and substrate specificity (1Smith K. Nadeau K. Bradley M. Walsh C. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Google Scholar). An enzyme catalyzing the analogous reaction inE. coli has recently been cloned. Surprisingly, this GspS also exhibits a substantial amidase activity with Gsp as substrate. The simultaneous catalysis of Gsp synthesis and breakdown results in an apparently futile ATP consumption, the biological role of which remains speculative (23Bollinger J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14031-14041Google Scholar, 24Kwon D.S. Lin C.-H. Chen S. Coward J.K. Walsh C.T. Bollinger J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2429-2436Google Scholar). Since E. coli does not produce TSH, its GspS obviously has to be seen in a biological context distinct from trypanosomal TSH metabolism, and also the structural and phylogenetic relationship of bacterial and trypanosomal GspS remains to be investigated. Here we report a convenient isolation procedure for GspS from C. fasciculata that allows an in depth analysis of this enzyme. Various physicochemical parameters, preliminary amino acid sequence data, and the kinetic mechanism of the enzyme are presented. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. The assays were carried out at 25.0 °C in a volume of 0.9 ml containing 50 mm bis-Tris-propane, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm GSH, and 10 mm spermidine (1Smith K. Nadeau K. Bradley M. Walsh C. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Google Scholar). The assay for trypanothione synthetase (TS) was carried out as described by Smith et al. (1Smith K. Nadeau K. Bradley M. Walsh C. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Google Scholar). Aliquots were taken after 20 min. For thiol analysis, a precolumn derivatization with the fluorescent thiol-specific reagent, monobromobimane (Calbiochem), was used as described previously (2Shim H. Fairlamb A.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 807-817Google Scholar). All samples for HPLC analysis were diluted 4-fold with water. Separation and analytical conditions were as described previously (26Fairlamb A.H. Henderson G.B. Bacchi C.J. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 24: 185-191Google Scholar). HPLC analysis was performed with a Jasco-HPLC-system consisting of an autosampler (851-AS), a pump (PU-980), a ternary gradient unit (LG-980–02), and a highly sensitive fluorescence detector (FP-920), which enabled a precise analysis of the small product peak within numerous other and larger ones. An external standard (0.04 mm Gsp) was used for integration calibration of the samples. The malachite green colorimetric assay for liberation of inorganic phosphate (1Smith K. Nadeau K. Bradley M. Walsh C. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Google Scholar) was used for fast detection of GspS activity during purification after column chromatography and for GspS localization on gels. C. fasciculatawas grown in a medium previously described (27Le Trant N. Meshnick S.R. Kitchener K. Eaton J.W. Cerami A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 125-130Google Scholar) in a 100-liter fermenter at 27 °C with continuous stirring (200 rpm) and aeration (0.1 volume/volume/min). Organisms were harvested in the late logarithmic growth phase by continuous flow centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended with 100 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT and 1 mm MgSO4. After centrifugation, the cells were stored at −20 °C. 250 g of cells were suspended in 250 ml of 20 mm bis-Tris-propane buffer, pH 7.5, disrupted by freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing. The crude homogenate was subjected to an aqueous two-phase extraction at room temperature. All other operations were performed at 4 °C. For extraction of GspS aqueous two-phase systems (total mass, 900 g) were prepared by weighing in concentrated solutions of the phase components and finally the crude extract (Fig. 1). A poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)/phosphate system containing 7.5% (w/w) PEG6000, 13% (w/w) sodium-potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 40% crude homogenate (or water in the blank systems) was used. The mixture was gently shaken for 10 min at room temperature and separated by centrifugation at 5000 × g. The top phase was sucked off and applied to a bottom phase of a blank system. After mixing, centrifugation, and separation of the phases, the PEG-rich top phase of the second phase extraction was mixed with a blank bottom phase, adjusted to pH 6.0 with HCl. This third system was mixed again, centrifuged, and separated. Now the GspS was found in the phosphate-rich bottom phase. The phosphate-rich third bottom phase and other pooled enzyme fractions were diafiltrated with a membrane with a cut-off of 30 kDa (Filtron Minisette) using a Pro Flux M12 diafiltrator (Amicon) at 0.2 megapascals and a 500-fold volume of 2 mmbis-Tris-propane buffer, pH 8.0. A BioLogic-System (Bio-Rad) was used at 4 °C for all chromatographies. The diafiltrated protein mixture was applied onto a Resource Q column (6 ml) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 2 mm bis-Tris-propane buffer, pH 8.0. After washing with 10 column volumes of equilibration buffer, the bound proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a gradient of 0.0–0.4 m KCl (100% B) as follows: t = 0 min, B = 0%; t = 20 min,B = 15%; t = 40 min, B= 15%; t = 60 min, B = 30%;t = 120 min, B = 30%;t = 150 min, B = 100%. The GspS eluted at 0.27 m KCl, and the pooled active fractions were diafiltrated with 2 mm bis-Tris-propane buffer, pH 6.0. The diafiltrated proteins were applied onto Poros 20 Pi (0.46 × 10 cm, 1.7 ml) (Perseptive Biosystems) equilibrated with 2 mmbis-Tris-propane buffer, pH 6.0. After washing with 10 column volumes of equilibration buffer, bound proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 4 ml/min with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl (100% B) as follows:t = 0 min, B = 0%; t = 8 min, B = 35%; t = 16 min,B = 35%; t = 17 min, B= 37%; t = 21 min, B = 37%;t = 25 min, B = 100%. GspS eluted at 0.7 m NaCl. Pooled active fractions were adjusted to 1 m ammonium sulfate and applied onto a hydrophobic interaction chromatography column Poros 20 PE (0.46 × 10 cm, 1.7 ml) (Perseptive Biosystems) equilibrated with 20 mm bis-Tris-propane buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1m ammonium sulfate, washed with 10 column volumes of equilibration buffer, and eluted with a linear gradient of 1–0m ammonium sulfate and a flow rate of 4 ml/min over 7.5 min. GspS eluted at 0.75 m ammonium sulfate. Pooled active fractions were diafiltrated with 10 mm bis-Tris-propane buffer, pH 6.8. The diafiltrated fraction was applied onto a Mono P HR 5/20 column (4 ml) (Pharmacia) for anion exchange chromatography. The column was equilibrated with 10 mmbis-Tris-propane buffer, pH 6.8. After washing with 10 column volumes of equilibration buffer, bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl (100% B) as follows: t = 0 min, B = 0%; t = 20 min,B = 25%; t = 40 min, B= 25%; t = 60 min, B = 50%;t = 80 min, B = 50%; t= 100 min, B = 100%. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. GspS eluted at 0.45 m NaCl. Proteins were applied onto a gel permeation chromatography column, Superose 12 (HR 10/30) (Pharmacia), equilibrated with 20 mmbis-Tris-propane buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl, and eluted with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Blue dextran (2,000 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa) were used as standards. The subunit molecular weight was determined by SDS-PAGE (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) using a PhastGel Gradient 8-25 (Pharmacia) with the following molecular mass standards: phosphorylase b (94 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa). The native molecular weight was determined by native PAGE using a PhastGel Gradient 8–25 (Pharmacia) with the same molecular mass standards and additionally thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa). The isoelectric point was determined by isoelectric focusing using a PhastGel IEF 3–9 (Pharmacia) with a broad pI calibration kit and by titration curve analysis with PhastGel IEF 3–9. The latter technique is a two-dimensional electrophoresis. In the first dimension, a pH gradient is generated. The gel is then rotated clockwise 90°, and the sample is applied perpendicular to the pH gradient across the middle of the gel (29Rosengreen A. Bjellquist B. Gasparic V. Radola B.J. Graesslin D. Electrofocusing and Isotachophoresis. W. de Gruyter, Berlin1977: 165-171Google Scholar). For detection of GspS activity after native PAGE or isoelectric focusing, the gels were cut into two pieces; one was silver-stained for protein detection, and the second was incubated for 15 min at room temperature in a solution of 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 10 mm GSH, 10 mmspermidine, and 2 mm ATP. After 15 min, 2.5 ml of a staining solution containing malachite green, ammonium molybdate, and Tween 20 (1Smith K. Nadeau K. Bradley M. Walsh C. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Google Scholar) was added. Lanes containing active GspS showed a dark green color after few minutes. The GspS content in partially purified samples was determined using SDS capillary electrophoresis (Bio-Rad) on the basis of the absorption at 280 nm and assuming an identical absorption coefficient for all proteins in the sample. SDS-PAGE of purified GspS was performed at a constant current of 20 mA in a separating gel (7.5% T). For blotting, the proteins were transferred for 1.5 h onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 40 V/70 mA in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine, and 10% (v/v) methanol. The blot was stained with Coomassie Blue. For peptide sequencing, the band corresponding to a molecular mass of 78 kDa was cut out. This material was washed and digested with endoproteinase Lys-C as described before (30Maiorino M. Roche C. Kieß M. Koenig K. Gawlik D. Matthes M. Naldini E. Pierce R. Flohé L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 838-844Google Scholar) and separated by reversed-phase HPLC (30Maiorino M. Roche C. Kieß M. Koenig K. Gawlik D. Matthes M. Naldini E. Pierce R. Flohé L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 838-844Google Scholar). Peptide peaks were detected at 214 nm and collected manually. Aliquots of 15–30 μl were applied directly to biobrene-coated, precycled glass fiber filters of a sequencer (Applied Biosystems 470A) with standard gas phase programs of the manufacturer. All kinetic experiments were carried out at 25.0 °C in a volume of 0.9 ml containing 50 mm bis-Tris-propane, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmDTT, and variable concentrations of ATP (0.10, 0.13, 0.18, 0.28, and 0.66 mm), GSH (0.36, 0.47, 0.66, 1.11, and 3.57 mm), and spermidine (0.36, 0.47, 0.66, 1.11, and 3.57 mm), respectively. The enzymatic tests for kinetic studies except the ADP inhibition studies were performed in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate (10 mm) and pyruvate kinase (0.5 units). A fixed magnesium concentration of 5 mm and a GspS content of 0.072 mg (0.923 μm) was used. Aliquots were taken at 15 and 30 min. GspS activity was analyzed by product determination as described above. 31P NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX 400 NMR spectrometer (at 162 MHz and locked to the deuterium resonance of D2O) to detect potential partial reactions. The experiments were carried out at 25.0 °C in a volume of 0.6 ml containing 50 mm bis-Tris-propane, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, in the presence of 20% D2O. Spectra were recorded at the beginning of the experiment and after the addition of the substrates (5 mm ATP, 10 mm GSH, and 10 mm spermidine). The purification strategy outlined under “Experimental Procedures” resulted in a GspS preparation with a specific activity of 37.6 units/mg at an overall yield of about 20%. The purification factor achieved was 12,500. As is seen from TableI, the phase distribution system applied proved to be highly efficient in enriching GspS.Table IPurification of glutathionylspermidine synthetaseVolumeProteinSpecific activityPurification factorYieldmlmgunits/mg%Crude extract3807600.00.0031100First extraction into top phase170221.00.09231107Second extraction into top phase170119.00.1294381Extraction into bottom phase50550.60.1996653Diafiltration120048.00.258363Resource Q64.21.137025Poros 20 Pi80.85.8194324Poros 20 PE50.212.2406713Mono P50.137.61253319 Open table in a new tab The optimized procedure was based on a factorial design of phase compositions (31Menge U. Todd P. Sikdar S.K. Bier M. Frontiers in Bioprocessing II. ACS Books, Washington, D. C.1992: 331-339Google Scholar), i.e. PEG6000/phosphate (7.5/13% (w/w)), PEG4000/phosphate (8/14% (w/w)), PEG1550/phosphate (9/18% (w/w)), each tested at pH 4.0, 5.5, and 7.0 and containing 40% cell lysate. By centrifugation, the cell debris was concentrated in a gum-like interphase if the pH of the system was ≥5.5. A graphical evaluation of the experimental data (not shown) clearly demonstrated a significant increase in the partition coefficient of GspS with increasing pH and a decrease in the partition coefficient of the total protein with increasing molecular weight of PEG. The best system, containing 7.5% (w/w) PEG6000, 13% (w/w) phosphate, pH 7.0, yielded an extraction of GspS into the top phase (Fig. 1) with a purification factor of 30 in one step. Some residual turbidity left in the top phase of the initial extraction could be eliminated by a second extraction step, mixing the primary top phase with a bottom phase of an identical blank system. By these systems, a proteolytic activity, as observed with casein yellow, and an ATPase activity were quantitatively removed by extraction into the bottom phases. Simultaneously, GspS was completely separated from TS activity. While GspS was recovered completely in the top phase, TS activity was extracted into the bottom phase (Fig. 1), but it proved to be unstable and was not purified further. This confirms, in contrast to previous assumptions (22Henderson G.B. Yamaguchi M. Novoa L. Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3924-3929Google Scholar), the existence of two distinct enzymes involved in trypanothione biosynthesis (1Smith K. Nadeau K. Bradley M. Walsh C. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Google Scholar). After two extractions into top phases, GspS was essentially free of interfering enzymatic activities and could be precisely quantitated. The final chromatographic purification of GspS, however, was impaired by the high phosphate concentration and viscosity of the top phase in which the enzyme was dissolved. GspS was therefore extracted from the second top phase into the bottom phase of a third system by lowering its pH to 6.0 without loss of activity. The GspS in the phosphate-rich bottom phase was diafiltrated and then could be loaded onto a Resource Q column. The specific activity of GspS obtained after additional chromatographic steps was about 6-fold higher than achieved before (1Smith K. Nadeau K. Bradley M. Walsh C. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Google Scholar), and also the yields compared favorably with previous experience. In fact, GspS thus purified appeared homogeneous by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) and by titration curve analysis (Fig. 3).Figure 3Titration curve analysis of the homogeneous glutathionylspermidine synthetase. 1. dimension, isoelectric focusing, run without protein sample; 2. dimension, native PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A subunit molecular mass of GspS of 78 kDa was estimated by SDS-PAGE, and an identical value was obtained by gradient gel electrophoresis of the native enzyme. In the latter case, the identity of the 78-kDa band with GspS was confirmed by activity staining, i.e. phosphate liberation upon incubation with Mg2+-ATP, GSH, and spermidine (not shown). Also, gel permeation chromatography on Superose 12 indicated a comparable molecular mass (79 kDa). A small activity peak eluted at about 170 kDa, suggesting a slight tendency of the enzyme to dimerize. In essence, however, GspS of C. fasciculata was present as a monomeric enzyme of 78 kDa. Its isoelectric point deduced from isoelectric focusing was at pH 4.6. Functional characterization of GspS of C. fasciculata was performed with a 400-fold purified preparation, i.e. with the fraction obtained after step 6 in Table I, since the pure enzyme, even when stored at 4 °C and −20 °C, almost completely lost its activity within 1 day. According to purity analysis by capillary electrophoresis, the partially purified preparation contained 33% GspS. At this stage of purification, GspS activity was stable in 20 mm bis-Tris-propane, pH 8.0, and in the presence of 8 mm DTT for more than 2 months at −20 °C. However, it lost its activity within 1 day in the presence of 1 mphosphate and 1 m ammonium sulfate. At room temperature, the enzyme could be stored for more than 24 h without loss of activity, which guaranteed reliable functional studies at the temperature optimum between 25 and 30 °C. Biosynthetic activity required the presence of magnesium ions. In partially purified GspS, we did not observe any TS activity, at a detection limit of ≥1% of the corresponding GspS rate. We could also exclude an amidase activity of C. fasciculata GspS, which had been described for the corresponding E. coli enzyme (23Bollinger J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14031-14041Google Scholar,24Kwon D.S. Lin C.-H. Chen S. Coward J.K. Walsh C.T. Bollinger J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2429-2436Google Scholar), since Gsp was not hydrolyzed by C. fasciculata GspS under experimental conditions that would have detected a hydrolytic activity at a 1% level of the synthetase activity. TSH hydrolysis was also not detected (not shown). These findings contrast markedly with a relative amidase activity of 18% (pH 7.5) or 35% (pH 8.5) of the synthetase activity reported for E. coli GspS. Also, the pH optimum of the C. fasciculata enzyme (Fig. 4) is higher by nearly 1 pH unit (pH 7.6–7.8) than that of E. coli GspS (pH 6.8). As already observed by Smith et al. (1Smith K. Nadeau K. Bradley M. Walsh C. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Google Scholar), N-terminal amino acid sequencing proved unsuccessful, obviously due to an N-terminal blocking group. After proteolytic cleavage with endoproteinase Lys-C, however, a total of 11 peptides could be recovered from HPLC in a quality to allow sequencing. Of these peptides, seven could unambiguously be aligned to the deduced GspS sequence of E. coli recently published by Bollinger et al. (23Bollinger J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14031-14041Google Scholar) (Table II). GspS of E. coli and of C. fasciculata thus appeared to be phylogenetically related. However, based on the limited sequence information, the sequence similarity between these enzymes, with only 40% identity, appears rather low.Table IIPeptides of glutathionylspermidine synthetase from Crithidia fasciculata(10)VPFGEVQGYAPGHIPAYSNK(29)+*** + ***** + +**133SIITGLDSPFAAI(145)*** * + *(191)TYEPTE(196)* **(202)NEIPRPLTHK(211)** * +(227)LDLNDPAE(234)** **++(500)ILPIIYHNHPDHPAILRAE(518)****++ * * +* +(535)IVGRVGRNVTITDG(548)*+** * *+ +The amino acid numbering corresponds to the E. coli sequence (23Bollinger J.M.

The analysis of the kinetic mechanism by steady-state kinetics were performed by means of direct product (Gsp) detection at fixed time points. The time points were set to yield less than 15% consumption of the limiting substrate but more than 0.002 mm Gsp for a reliable quantification. In the beginning, nonlinear Lineweaver-Burk plots were obtained that could be attributed to product (ADP) inhibition (see below) and, at an ATP concentration above 1 mm, also to substrate inhibition (not shown). When ADP accumulation was avoided by coincubation with phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate kinase and the concentrations of ATP were kept constant at levels below 1 mm, linear double-reciprocal plots were observed.

Glucose deprivation caused an immediate increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in MCF-7/ADR cells and specifically activated Lyn kinase, a src family tyrosine kinase. In addition, hypoglycemic treatment strongly activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), leading to the phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun. Experiments with Lyn antisense oligonucleotides demonstrated that Lyn kinase activation was responsible for the activation of JNK1 but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase. We also observed glucose deprivation-induced Ras activation in MCF-7/ADR cells.

The initiation of angiogenic activity is recognized as one of the critical steps in tumor development and metastasis. It has been demonstrated that ischemia/hypoxia (1Plate K.H. Breier G. Millauer B. Ullrich A. Risau W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5822-5827Google Scholar, 2Millauer B. Shawver L.K. Plate K.H. Risau W. Ullirich A. Nature. 1994; 367: 576-579Google Scholar), radiation (3Witte L. Fuks Z.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1040-1043Google Scholar) can stimulate the synthesis of angiogenic factor(s), such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) 1The abbreviations used are: bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; SRE, serum response element; TCF, ternary complex factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MEKK, mitogen-activated response kinase kinase kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; SRE, serum response element; TCF, ternary complex factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MEKK, mitogen-activated response kinase kinase kinase.and vascular endothelial growth factor. Angiogenic factors can trigger the formation of new blood vessels, allowing more nutrients and O2 to reach cancer cells, and also provide a route for metastasis. A fundamental question that remains unanswered is how the stresses stimulate the synthesis of these angiogenic factors. The genes encoding angiogenic factors such as bFGF have been shown to contain AP-1 cis-acting elements (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element) in their promoter region (6,–8), which are recognized by AP-1 transcription factors (Jun and Fos family proteins) (9Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Google Scholar, 10Deng T. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 479-490Google Scholar). The activity of AP-1 transcription factors is controlled by transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. It has been shown that transcriptional activation of the c-jun gene is exerted through the distal and proximal AP-1 binding sites (9Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Google Scholar), which are recognized by either c-Jun homodimers or c-Jun/activating transcription factor-2 heterodimers (9Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Google Scholar, 10Deng T. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 479-490Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of these binding factors is stimulated by the phosphorylation of c-Jun (11Pulverer B.J. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Nikolakaki E. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Google Scholar, 12Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D.A. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Google Scholar, 13Smeal T. Binetruy B Mercola D. Grover B.A. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3507-3513Google Scholar), and possibly activating transcription factor-2 (14Abel-Hafiz H.A.M. Heasley L.E. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Kroll D.J. Johnson G.L. Hoeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2079-2089Google Scholar, 15Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Google Scholar), by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The induction of c-fostranscription is mediated by the serum response element (SRE) and the v-sis conditioned medium induction element. The SRE is recognized by a homodimer of serum response factor (16Treisman R. Cell. 1986; 46: 567-574Google Scholar), and the binary SRE-serum response factor complex interacts with the ternary complex factor (TCF) (17Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the activity of TCF is rapidly increased in response to stimulation with various agents, such as growth factors, which leads to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). ERK has been shown to be responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of TCF (18Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Google Scholar, 19Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Google Scholar). Taken together, phosphorylation of c-Jun and other transcription factors appears to be the link between the transcriptional activity of AP-1 containing genes and ERK or JNK kinase signaling cascades, allowing the expression of these genes to be triggered by different stimuli. We have previously demonstrated that hypoglycemia activates the expression of c-jun and c-fos genes, which results in an increase in AP-1 activity and subsequent bFGF gene expression in drug-resistant human breast carcinoma MCF-7/ADR cells (20Galoforo S.S. Berns C.M. Erdos G. Corry P.M. Lee Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 155: 163-171Google Scholar). In an effort to fully understand the signaling mechanism that triggered these responses, we studied the phosphorylation events that may lead to the activation of AP-1 transcription factors. The study reported here demonstrates that hypoglycemic treatment of MCF-7/ADR cells activated Lyn kinase, which increased the activity of JNK1 and the phosphorylation of c-Jun. These results suggest a possible signal transduction pathway in MCF-7/ADR cells that responds to hypoglycemic conditions. The expression vector pCMV5-JNK1 (21Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I. Barrett Y. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Karin (University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA). This vector encodes the human JNK1 with a N-terminal FLAG tag. To obtain stably transfected cells, we subcloned the HindIII-XbaI fragment of pCMV5-JNK1 containing the entire JNK1 coding region into the expression vector pcDNA3. The resulting plasmid was named pcDNA3-JNK1FLAG. Drug-resistant human breast carcinoma (MCF-7/ADR) cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium with 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 26 mmsodium bicarbonate. Two or three days prior to the experiments, cells were plated into T-75 flasks or 60- or 100-mm Petri dishes. The flasks/Petri dishes containing cells were kept in a 37 °C humidified incubator with a mixture of 95% air and 5% CO2. Transfections were performed using Lipofectace reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) per the manufacturer's instructions. McCoy's 5A medium containing 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) was placed onto cells 48 h post-transfection to select for transfected cells. MCF-7/ADR cells were rinsed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution prewarmed at 37 °C. Cells were then treated with glucose-free McCoy's 5A medium with 10% dialyzed bovine calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) for the specified time intervals. To assay for c-Jun-associated kinase activity, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS). The lysates were precleared with glutathione-agarose beads followed by incubation with 10 μl of GST-c-Jun (1–169) agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min and washed twice with the lysis buffer and twice with the kinase assay buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol). The beads were then resuspended in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2000 cpm/pmol) and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 30 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. The reaction mixture was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylation of c-Jun was visualized by autoradiography. To assay for the activity of JNK1, MCF-7/ADR cells transfected with pcDNA3-JNK1FLAG were lysed in lysis buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS). The lysates were incubated with 3 μg of M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1 h followed by incubation with protein A-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.). The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 2 min and washed four times with the lysis buffer. The immune complex kinase assay was performed with purified GST-c-Jun (1–135) fusion protein (a generous gift from Dr. Kyriakis) as described (22Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Avruch J. Woodgett J. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Google Scholar). Briefly, a 20-μl aliquot of purified GST-c-Jun (1–135) (0.2 mg/ml in the kinase assay buffer) was added to the immunoprecipitate. The reaction was initiated by adding [γ-32P]ATP to a final concentration of 100 μm (2500 mCi/mmol) and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min before being stopped by adding 30 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer and boiling. The reaction mixture was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylation of c-Jun was visualized by autoradiography. src family kinases, (Abl, Fyn, Lck, and Lyn kinase) were immunoprecipitated from MCF-7/ADR cells as described for JNK1, using the appropriate antibodies (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA). The assays were carried out using a tyrosine kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology), which employs synthetic peptides as substrates. The reaction mixture (45 μl) contained the assay buffer (250 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 125 mm MgCl2, 25 mm MnCl2, and 0.25 mmNa3PO4), 0.5 mm[γ-32P] ATP (2000 cpm/pmol), 1.5 mmsubstrate peptide stock, and the immunoprecipitated srcfamily kinase resuspended in 20 μl of dilution buffer (200 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 50% acetic acid. The samples were centrifuged at 9000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 2 min, and 25 μl of the supernatant from each tube was spotted onto a 2.1-cm p81 phosphocellulose filter paper disc (Whatman, Hillsboro, OR). The filter discs were washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid, washed once with acetone, and air dried. The amount of [32P]PO4 incorporated into the peptide substrate was determined by counting the filter discs in a Packard 2200 CA Tri-Carb scintillation counter. Antisense treatment was carried out as described (23Dean N.M. McKay R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11762-11766Google Scholar) with modifications. MCF-7/ADR cells were grown in 60-mm Petri dishes until they were 60–70% confluent and washed twice with McCoy's 5A medium without serum. The antisense mixture was made by combining solution A (20 mg/ml Lipofectace in 0.25 ml of McCoy's 5A medium without serum) and solution B (400 nm of the antisense oligonucleotide in 0.25 ml of McCoy's 5A medium without serum). The antisense mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min, diluted to 2 ml with McCoy's 5A medium without serum, and applied to cells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h and washed once with McCoy's 5A with 10% serum, and the incubation was continued for 48 h before harvesting. MCF-7/ADR cells were grown in 60-mm Petri dishes, washed twice with phosphate-free McCoy's medium containing dialyzed serum, and incubated in the same medium for 45 min. The medium was replaced by phosphate-free McCoy's containing 0.25 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (ICN, Irvine, CA), and the incubation was continued for an additional 3 h. After the glucose deprivation treatment, the cells were lysed in 500 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 mm vanadate) containing 20 μg of monoclonclonal rat-anti-Ras antibody (Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h on a rotating wheel. A 50-μl aliquot of protein G-agarose (Oncogene Science) linked to goat anti Rat IgG (Oncogene Science) was added, and the mixture was further incubated for 1 h. The immunoprecipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed four times in lysis buffer, and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of 0.75 m KH2PO4, pH 3.4, and boiled for 5 min. Separation of the Ras bound GTP and GTP was carried out on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates in 0.75 mKH2PO4, pH 3.4, followed by autoradiography of the TLC plates. The autoradiograph was subjected to densitometric analysis, and the extent of Ras activation was calculated by the ratio of the relative intensity of GTP/(GTP + GDP). To investigate whether glucose deprivation can activate cellular protein tyrosine kinases, MCF-7/ADR cells were incubated in glucose-free medium and harvested at various time points. Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody showed that there was a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (Fig. 1). Such increase of tyrosine phosphorylation was detectable within 5 min during glucose deprivation treatment to at least 2 h after the treatment. The early increase of tyrosine phosphorylation led us to hypothesize that activation of protein tyrosine kinases is probably one of the upstream signals of the glucose deprivation-induced response in MCF-7/ADR cells. Because src family kinases have been shown to be involved in a variety of cellular responses, such as to growth factors, oxidative stress, and G protein-coupled signaling cascades (24Gould K. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3345-3356Google Scholar, 25Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Zhou X. Foster D. Brugge J.S. Suhatme V.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Google Scholar, 26Wan Y. Kurosaki T. Huang X.Y. Nature. 1996; 380: 541-544Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that src family tyrosine kinases are involved in the hypoglycemia-induced responses in MCF-7/ADR cells. Several src family members, Abl, Fyn, Lck, and Lyn kinases were immunoprecipitated from MCF-7/ADR cell lysates after glucose deprivation treatment. Tyrosine kinase assay of the immunoprecipitates showed that although the activities of Abl, Fyn, and Lck kinases were not significantly changed during the 4 h of the glucose deprivation treatment, Lyn kinase was activated 3∼4-fold (Fig.2). The activation of Lyn kinase was obvious within 5 min during the glucose deprivation treatment and lasted for at least 4 h. Compared with the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation in MCF-7/ADR cells under the same conditions, the early activation of Lyn kinase indicates that the activated Lyn kinase is involved in the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation in MCF-7/ADR cells during glucose deprivation treatment. To investigate the mechanism for the induction of AP-1 activity during glucose deprivation treatment, we assayed for c-Jun kinase activity in the lysates of MCF-7/ADR cells using recombinant GST-c-Jun as the substrate. Fig. 3 A showed that there was a significant increase in c-Jun phosphorylation after glucose deprivation treatment. To further confirm that the observed activation of c-Jun kinase activity was due to an increase in JNK1 activity, we performed the kinase assay using transfected MCF-7/ADR cells that express an epitope (FLAG)-tagged JNK1. We observed that JNK1 immunoprecipitated from the transfected cells after hypoglycemic treatment caused significantly greater phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun than untreated cells, indicating that JNK1 is strongly activated by the glucose deprivation treatment (Fig. 3 B). However, when the similar assays were performed using ERK1 and ERK2 immunoprecipitated from glucose deprivation-treated MCF-7/ADR cells, we did not detect any significant phosphorylation of c-Jun by ERKs (Fig. 3 C). To study whether the activation of Lyn kinase participated in signaling to the activation of c-Jun, we examined the effect of Lyn antisense oligonuleotide on glucose deprivation-induced c-Jun kinase activity in MCF-7/ADR cells. Fig.4 A showed that compared with treatment with Lyn sense oligonucleotide, Lyn antisense oligonuleotide inhibited over 80% of Lyn kinase activity in cells growing in normal medium and in the glucose-free medium. The JNK kinase assay demonstrated that antisense treatment markedly reduced glucose deprivation-induced JNK1 activity in MCF-7/ADR cells (Fig. 4 B). On the other hand, we did not detect any inhibition of glucose deprivation-induced ERK activation with the antisense treatment (Fig. 4 C). These results suggest that Lyn kinase is responsible for hypoglycemia-induced JNK1 activation but not ERK activation in MCF-7/ADR cells. Because it has been demonstrated that Ras can activate the JNK pathway, we examined the extent of Ras activation in MCF-7/ADR cells after hypoglycemia treatment. The activation state of p21ras was measured by metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphate and then lysing the cells followed by immunoprecipitation of Ras. TLC assay was performed to determine the amount of GTP and GDP bound to Ras. Fig. 5 showed that there was a significant increase in GTP bound Ras after 5 min of glucose deprivation treatment in MCF-7/ADR cells. Densitometric analysis of the autoradiograph showed that the percentage of active Ras increased approximately 4.5-fold during hypoglycemic treatment. The study reported here demonstrated a possible signal transduction pathway in MCF-7/ADR cells that responds to hypoglycemic conditions. Lyn kinase was initially activated by hypoglycemic conditions. Activation of Lyn kinase causes the activation of JNK1, which further phosphorylates and activates c-Jun. Being the major component of the AP-1 transcription factor, c-Jun, once activated, can subsequently activate the transcription of genes, such as bFGF, which contain AP-1 elements (20Galoforo S.S. Berns C.M. Erdos G. Corry P.M. Lee Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 155: 163-171Google Scholar). The fact that the c-jun gene itself also contains an AP-1 element in its promoter indicates that phosphorylation of c-Jun allows signals in this pathway to be amplified. First, phosphorylation of c-Jun activates the transcription of c-jun per se, increasing the amount of available c-Jun for the formation of the AP-1 complex. Second, phosphorylation of c-Jun also increases the activity of the newly formed AP-1 factors, allowing the AP-1 transcriptional activity to be further activated. Although JNK and ERK both belong to the mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily and are structurally homologous, recent studies have demonstrated that their functions appear to be divergent. JNK, also referred to as stress-activated protein kinase, is a more potent c-Jun kinase than ERK. JNK is primarily induced by stress conditions such as UV radiation (21Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I. Barrett Y. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Google Scholar), hypoxia (27Pombo C.M. Bonvente J.V. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26546-26551Google Scholar), and osmotic shocks (28Galcheva-Gargova Z. Derijard B. Wu I.-H. Dadis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Google Scholar). Consistently, we found that a different kind of stress, glucose deprivation, also stimulated JNK1, which is directly responsible for the activation of c-Jun and subsequently the induction of bFGF gene expression. However, data from this and a previous study (29Gupta, A. K., Lee, Y. J., Galoforo, S. S., Berns, C. M., Martinez, A. A., Corry, P. M., Wu, X.-Y., and Guan, K.-L. (1996) Mol. Cell. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar) showed that ERK was also activated by hypoglycemic treatment of MCF-7/ADR cells. The duration of ERK activation was more than 1 h, more persistent than the activation of JNK1, suggesting that hypoglycemia-induced ERK activity probably have some specific function. ERK is responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of the TCF, which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of c-fos. Therefore, it is possible that ERK is responsible for the observed induction of c-fos gene expression induced by hypoglycemia (20Galoforo S.S. Berns C.M. Erdos G. Corry P.M. Lee Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 155: 163-171Google Scholar). This speculation remains to be tested in future studies. Lyn kinase, a membrane-associated src family kinase, has been shown to be involved in a variety of signaling responses, including to chemoattractant receptors (30Ptasznik A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bolcoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19969-19973Google Scholar), radiation (31Yang C. Maruyama S. Yanagi S. Wang X. Takata M. Kurosaki T. Yamamura H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 33-38Google Scholar), and B cell receptor activation (32Myers D.E. Jun C. Waddick K.G. Forsyth L. Chelstrom L.M. Gunther R.L. Tumer N.E. Bolen J. Uckun F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9575-9579Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that Lyn kinase activity also can be stimulated by hypoglycemic treatments. Although the downstream substrates of Lyn kinase are largely unknown, recent studies indicate that activated Lyn kinase phosphorylates and associates with the adapter protein Shc through SH2 domain interactions (30Ptasznik A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bolcoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19969-19973Google Scholar). The activated Shc can further associate with the Grb2-Sos complex, leading to the activation of the Ras-dependent pathway (33Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagu D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Google Scholar, 34Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. Van Aelst L. Schlessinger J. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Google Scholar). Our data from the experiments with Lyn antisense oligonucleotide provided direct evidence that Lyn kinase is responsible for the activation of JNK1. In this study, we also observed the activation of Ras in glucose deprivation-treated MCF-7/ADR cells. It is likely that the activation of JNK1 by Lyn kinase is achieved in a Ras-dependent fashion, possibly through the activation of MEKK, the activator of JNK1, as demonstrated by other investigators (35Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Google Scholar, 36Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that the signal transduction sequence of Lyn → Ras → MEKK → JNK1 → c-Jun is responsible for the hypoglycemia-induced c-Jun activation in MCF-7/ADR cells. It remains to be understood how glucose deprivation treatment triggered the activation of Lyn kinase. Preliminary data in our laboratory demonstrated that the activation of Lyn kinase and JNK1 by glucose deprivation treatment of MCF-7/ADR cells can be inhibited byN-acetyl-cysteine, a free radical scavenger, suggesting that free radicals are involved in the glucose deprivation-induced response. Other reports have shown that src family kinases, including Lyn kinase, also can be activated by ionizing radiation and reactive oxygen (31Yang C. Maruyama S. Yanagi S. Wang X. Takata M. Kurosaki T. Yamamura H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 33-38Google Scholar, 37Schieven G.L. Kirihara J.M. Myers D.E. Ledbetter J.A. Uckun F.M. Blood. 1993; 82: 1212-1220Google Scholar), which induce cellular free radicals. It is likely that Lyn kinase is activated by a common mechanism mediated by free radicals. Further studies are under way to test this possibility."

The signaling pathways and mechanisms presiding over this induction in keratinocytes at the wound edge remain to be defined. We reported previously that of the multiple genes encoding K6 isoforms in human, K6a is dominant in skin epithelia (Takahashi, K., Paladini, R., Coulombe, P. A. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 18581–18592). Using bacterial LacZ as a reporter gene in transgenic mice, we show that the proximal 5.2 kilobases of 5′-upstream sequence from the K6a gene fails to direct sustained expression in any adult tissue, including those where K6 is constitutively expressed (e.g. hair follicle, nail, oral mucosa, tongue, esophagus, forestomach). In contrast, the proximal 960 base pairs of 5′-upstream sequence suffice to mediate an induction of β-galactosidase expression in a near-correct spatial and temporal fashion after injury to epidermis and other stratified epithelia. Transgene expression also occurs following topical application of phorbol esters, all-trans-retinoic acid, or 2–4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene, all known to induce K6 expression in skin. Our data show that critical regulatory sequences for this inducibility are located between −960 and −550 bp in the 5′-upstream sequence of K6a and that their activity is influenced by enhancer element(s) located between −2500 and −5200 base pairs. These findings have important implications for the control of gene expression after injury to stratified epithelia. Injury to the epidermis and other stratified epithelia triggers a repair response involving the rapid induction of several genes, including keratin 6 (K6). The signaling pathways and mechanisms presiding over this induction in keratinocytes at the wound edge remain to be defined.

These findings have important implications for the control of gene expression after injury to stratified epithelia. Injury to skin triggers a repair response aimed at restoring epithelial continuity and barrier function. The activity of several genes encoding intracellular, cell surface, and secreted proteins is rapidly modulated in the epithelial and mesenchymal cells involved in this response (1Clark R.A.F. Fitzpatrick T.B. Eisen A.Z. Wolff K. Freedberg I.M. Austen M.D. Mechanisms of Cutaneous Wound Repair, Dermatology in General Medicine. I. McGraw-Hill, New York1993: 473-488Google Scholar). Keratins 6, 16, and 17, the gap junction protein connexin 26, the receptor for the urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and various proteases are induced in wound edge keratinocytes within hours after injury, and their subsequent accumulation correlates with major changes in keratinocyte cytoarchitecture that precede the onset of migration toward the wound site (2Coulombe P.A. Takahashi K. Cell Vision: J. Anal. Morphol. 1996; 3: 217-223Google Scholar). While the significance of these changes remains to be elucidated, the study of the regulation of the corresponding genes offers an opportunity to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset of the wound repair response in stratified epithelia. Indeed, even though the levels of several potent growth factors are greatly elevated in the wound site early after injury to the skin (reviewed in Ref. 3Falanga V. Dermatol. Clin. 1993; 11: 667-675Google Scholar), those playing a critical role in this vital homeostatic response remain to be identified. We recently cloned several human genes and cDNAs predicted to encode highly related keratin 6 (K6) isoforms (4Takahashi K. Paladini R. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18581-18592Google Scholar). K6 (56 kDa) is a type II keratin that belongs to the superfamily of intermediate filament proteins and is ususally co-expressed with one or two type I keratins, K16 and K17 (5Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Google Scholar, 6Tyner A.L. Eichman M.J. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4683-4687Google Scholar). The K6 isoforms show a complex pattern of expression in epithelia, with constitutive and inducible components (7O'Guin W.M. Schermer A. Lynch M. Sun T.-T. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 301-334Google Scholar). They are normally found in the outer root sheath (ORS) 1The abbreviations used are: ORS, outer root sheath; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; DNFB, 2–4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene; RA, all-trans-retinoic acid. of hair follicles, in glandular tissues, in tongue, gingiva and oral mucosa, esophagus, forestomach, and certain reproductive tract epithelia (e.g. Ref. 8Ramirez A. Vidal M. Bravo A. Larcher F. Jorcano J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4783-4787Google Scholar). With the exception of palm and sole, K6 is not expressed in normal interfollicular epidermis (5Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Google Scholar, 7O'Guin W.M.

Bravo A. Larcher F. Jorcano J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4783-4787Google Scholar). The K6 isoforms are better known for their much enhanced expression during hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation in stratified epithelia (4Takahashi K. Paladini R. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18581-18592Google Scholar, 9Weiss R.A. Eichner R. Sun T.T. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1397-1406Google Scholar, 10Stoler A. Kopan R. Duvic M. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 427-446Google Scholar). Thus, K6 and K16 are induced in wound edge keratinocytes as early as 4–6 h after injury to human skin and disappear after closure (11Paladini R.D. Takahashi K. Bravo N.S. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 381-397Google Scholar, 12Mansbridge J.N. Knapp A.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 89: 253-263Google Scholar). K6 expression is induced as well in a variety of diseases affecting complex epithelia, such as infections, squamous metaplasia, carcinoma, and chronic hyperproliferative disorders, including psoriasis (9Weiss R.A. Eichner R. Sun T.T. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1397-1406Google Scholar, 10Stoler A. Kopan R. Duvic M. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 427-446Google Scholar). In these conditions, K6 expression may be very abundant, but is usually restricted to the suprabasal compartment of the epithelium (10Stoler A. Kopan R. Duvic M. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 427-446Google Scholar). In mouse skin, K6 expression is induced after topical application of a variety of chemicals (e.g. phorbol esters, retinoic acid; see Ref. 13Schweizer J. Darmon M. Blumemberg M. Molecular Biology of the Skin: The Keratinocyte. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 33-78Google Scholar). K6 induction also occurs in primary cultures of mitotically active keratinocytes from epidermis, esophagus, trachea, and cornea (7O'Guin W.M. Schermer A. Lynch M. Sun T.-T. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 301-334Google Scholar, 14Schermer A. Jester J.V. Hardy C. Milano D. Sun T.T. Differentiation. 1989; 42: 103-110Google Scholar). Understanding the regulation of K6 gene expression is thus of great interest at various levels, one being the control of gene expression in contexts such as wound repair, psoriasis, and carcinoma. Using a transgenic mouse approach, we report here on the identification of a segment of 5′-upstream sequence in the human K6a gene that is both necessary and sufficient for the inducible expression of an heterologous reporter gene in adult mouse epithelia. Our starting template was the human K6a gene, the dominant K6 isoform in hair follicle outer root sheath, foot sole epidermis, and skin squamous carcinoma samples (4Takahashi K. Paladini R. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18581-18592Google Scholar). Segments containing 5.2 kb (SmaI-NcoI), 2.56 kb (HindIII-NcoI), 0.96 kb (EcoRI-NcoI), and 0.55 kb (SacI-NcoI) of 5′-upstream sequence from the translation initiation codon were isolated from the human K6a gene (GenBank accession numbers L42575–L42583L42575L42576L42577L42578L42579L42580L42581L42582L42583; see Ref. 4Takahashi K. Paladini R. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18581-18592Google Scholar) by restriction digestion and subcloned into a LacZ expression cassette. We used a LacZ coding sequence (plasmid pCH110) modified to contain a nuclear localization sequence at its 5′-coding end in addition to the SV40 poly(A) sequence at its 3′ end (15Li Z. Marchand P. Humbert J. Babinet C. Paulin D. Development ( Camb .). 1993; 117: 947-959Google Scholar). The four transgene constructs devised are as follows: KT1, [5.20-kb hK6a 5′-upstream sequence]-LacZ; KT2: [2.55-kb hK6a 5′-upstream sequence]-LacZ; KT3, [0.96-kb hK6a 5′-upstream sequence]-LacZ; KT4, [0.55-kb hK6a 5′-upstream sequence]-LacZ. Transgenic mice were produced by pronuclear injection of DNA constructs in single cell C57B6/BalbC3 embryos (16Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY1994Google Scholar). Founders were identified by Southern blotting of genomic DNAs using a probe to the coding portion of LacZ. Transgenic lines were established by matings in the C57B6/BalbC3 mixed background (Jackson Laboratories). Double-transgenic mice were produced by mating the previously described PC5-7-K16 transgenic mice, which contain 8–10 copies of the full-length human K16 gene (17Takahashi K. Folmer J. Coulombe P.A.

Bound primary antibodies were revealed by a peroxidase-based reaction as recommended (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). For biochemical analysis, adult mouse skin tissue extracts were prepared by homogenization in β-galactosidase reporter lysis buffer, and post-centrifugation supernatants were used for the detection of β-galactosidase enzymatic activity following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). All studies involving animals were reviewed by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Use and Care Committee. For studies involving skin, adult mice (3–6 months old) were anesthetized with avertin and their backs epilated with Nair cream. For injury, the surgical area was disinfected, and full thickness skin wounds were made with a 4-mm punch (Acu-Punch; Acuderm Inc., Ft. Lauderdale, FL). For studies involving other stratified epithelia, adult mice were anesthetized, and short superficial incisions were made with a sterile scalpel to either foot pad epidermis, cornea, oral mucosa, or tongue. Tissues were harvested after 24 h and processed for β-galactosidase histochemistry as described above. For studies involving chemical treatment of skin, solutions of PMA (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, 150 μl of a 50 μm stock in acetone; Sigma) and all-trans-retinoic acid (150 μl of a 100 μg/ml stock in ethanol; Sigma) were applied topically on Nair-epilated skin every 3rd day for three times. To induce a delayed-type skin hypersensitivity reaction, mice were sensitized with an application of 25 μl of 0.25% 2–4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene (DNFB) at the base of the tail and challenged 5 days later by application of 10 μl of the same solution onto the dorsal neck area as described (20Jun B.-D. Roberts L.K. Cho B.-H. Robertson B. Daynes R.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 90: 311-316Google Scholar). The mice were sacrificed and the skin processed for β-galactosidase histochemistry on the next day. Skin papillomas were induced using the two-step chemical carcinogenesis procedure (21Hennings H. Glick A.B. Lowry D.T. Krsmanovic L.S. Sly L.M. Yuspa S.H. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2353-2358Google Scholar), involving initiation with 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene and promotion with PMA for 11 weeks. Papillomas were harvested 1 month after cessation of treatment and processed for analysis. In all experiments involving chemical inducers, controls consisted in application of the vehicle only. Table I lists the transgenic lines produced for each of the constructs and reports on transgene expression assessed by β-galactosidase histochemistryin situ. None of the constructs, including KT1 (5.2 kb of K6a 5′-upstream sequence), shows consistent expression in the ear, trunk, tail, or paw skin of adult transgenic mice (Fig.1 A). In KT1, KT2, and KT3 lines, occasional ORS keratinocytes display β-galactosidase activity in a subset of hair follicles (Table I; Fig. 1 A). Generally, fewer that three to five follicles show sporadic X-gal staining in the ORS in a typical section (1–2 cm wide) of adult skin tissue (Fig.1 B). In contrast, endogenous K6 is easily detected in mouse hair follicles (Fig. 1 C). These findings are supported by immunostainings using antibodies against the β-galactosidase protein, by Northern blotting (data not shown), as well as by enzymatic assays performed in soluble extracts prepared from intact skin of adult transgenic mice (Table II). A notable exception occurs in the vibrissae follicles of whisker pads in several KT1 transgenic lines, which show weak LacZ activity in a greater number of ORS keratinocytes (Fig. 1, compare D and D-inset). Expression remains patchy, however, and is not seen in transgenic lines made with shorter K6a promoter-based constructs (KT3, KT4; not shown). A survey of other stratified epithelia known to express K6, such as nail, cornea (limbus), tongue, oral mucosa, esophagus, and forestomach fails to reveal β-galactosidase activity in the majority of transgenic lines produced (Fig. 1, E–H), albeit with a few exceptions (Table I). Among such exceptions are lines KT3-2m and KT3-4m, which show β-galactosidase activity in a very small subset of epithelial cells in tongue, esophagus, and/or cornea (typically, only 1–3 cells/entire histological section; Table I). The three other lines made with the KT3 construct do not show expression in these epithelia (Table I). Expression of the LacZ transgene is occasionally detected in other types of tissues as well (Table I). Thus, for each K6a promoter construct tested, one or two lines show sporadic expression in the retina, where K6 is not detectable by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1,I and I′). Since this “ectopic” expression does not appear to correlate with transgene copy number (Table I), it appears likely that the transcriptional activity of the LacZ transgenes is somewhat sensitive to their site of integration in the mouse genome.Table IIQuantitation of β-galactosidase activity in transgenic mouse skin extractsPromoterTG line2-aAll transgenic animals used were heterozygous at the transgene locus.

Multiple values correspond to different mice in a given transgenic line. Open table in a new tab K6 expression is induced following injury to the skin and other stratified epithelia (Fig.2 A), and this prompted us to examine transgene expression under such conditions. Full-thickness injury to the skin of adult mice induces lacZ expression in epidermis and hair follicles at the wound edge in most KT1, KT2, and KT3 transgenic lines, but in none of the KT4 lines (Table I). In the responsive lines, β-galactosidase activity occurs in keratinocytes proximal to the wound edge as early as 2.5 h after injury (Fig. 2, Band C) and extends further away from the wound site at later time points, in a pattern analogous to mouse endogenous K6 (Fig.2 D). Immunostaining for the β-galactosidase protein indicates that it is restricted to suprabasal keratinocytes in wounded skin tissue (Fig. 2 E). In contrast, mouse endogenous K6 typically extends down to the basal layer in epidermal tissue at the proximal edge of the wound (Fig. 2 A), underscoring a potential difference in the regulation of mouse endogenous K6 and our human K6a promoter-based transgenes (see Ref. 8Ramirez A. Vidal M. Bravo A. Larcher F. Jorcano J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4783-4787Google Scholar for similar observations when using the bovine K6β promoter in transgenic mice). Induction of LacZ expression also occurs after injury to other stratified epithelia, including oral mucosa (Fig. 2 F; TableI), cornea (Fig. 2 G), tongue (not shown), and foot pad epidermis (Fig. 2 H), with all but the shortest transgene (KT4). Thus, these observations establish that the critical information required to mediate rapid induction following injury is contained within the proximal 5′-upstream sequence of the human K6a gene. They further suggest that the signaling pathways involved in K6 activation after injury are likely to be related, if not the same, in these four different stratified epithelia. The histochemistry findings are supported by β-galactosidase enzymatic assays performed on soluble extracts prepared from wounded skin tissue, which also reveals differences in the extent of transgene induction depending upon the amount of K6a 5′-upstream sequence involved. At 48 h after skin injury, KT1 transgenic mice show a greater induction of β-galactosidase activity compared with KT2 and KT3 mice (Table II). We selected transgenic lines showing strong expression (KT1-3m, KT2-2m, KT3-3m) to compare the extent of β-galactosidase induction as a function of time after skin injury. The data obtained (Fig. 3) confirmed the rapid induction of the three types of transgene in wound edge tissue. However, peak enzymatic activities were reached at a later time and were three to five times as large in KT1 mice compared with KT2 and KT3 mice (Fig.3). These data suggest the presence of enhancer elements sensitive to injury and located upstream from −2500 bp in the 5′-upstream sequence of K6a. Topical application of the phorbol ester PMA and of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), both known to induce K6 expression in mouse epidermis (e.g. Refs. 8Ramirez A. Vidal M. Bravo A. Larcher F.

Coexpression of the α-subunit and Kvβ2, however, induces little change in channel properties. Since more than one β-subunit has been found in individual K+ channel complexes and expression patterns of different β-subunits overlap in vivo, it is important to test the possible physical and/or functional interaction(s) between different β-subunits. In this report, we show that both Kvβ2 and Kvβ1 recognize the same region on the pore-forming α-subunits of the Kv1 Shaker-like potassium channels. In the absence of α-subunits the Kvβ2 polypeptide interacts with additional β-subunit(s) to form either a homomultimer with Kvβ2 or a heteromultimer with Kvβ1. When coexpressing α-subunits and Kvβ1 in the presence of Kvβ2, we find that Kvβ2 is capable of inhibiting the Kvβ1-mediated inactivation. Using deletion analysis, we have localized the minimal interaction region that is sufficient for Kvβ2 to associate with both α-subunits and Kvβ1. This mapped minimal interaction region is necessary and sufficient for inhibiting the Kvβ1-mediated inactivation, consistent with the notion that the inhibitory activity of Kvβ2 results from the coassembly of Kvβ2 with compatible α-subunits and possibly with Kvβ1. Together, these results provide biochemical evidence that Kvβ2 may profoundly alter the inactivation activity of another β-subunit by either differential subunit assembly or by competing for binding sites on α-subunits, which indicates that Kvβ2 is capable of serving as an important determinant in regulating the kinetic properties of K+currents.

The heterogeneity of voltage-sensitive potassium currents present in excitable and nonexcitable cells is essential for diverse biological functions (1Connor J.A. Stevens C.F. J. Physiol.

Ionic Channels of Excitable Membrane. 1991; (and 99–116, Sinauer, Sunderland, MA): 58-75Google Scholar). In addition to the large number of genes encoding the channel subunits and posttranslational modulations of channel protein, the diversity of potassium channels is further enhanced by the mix-and-match assembly of different subunits (5Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 415-419Google Scholar, 6Salkoff L. Baker K. Butler A. Covarrubias M. Pak M.D. Wei A. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 161-166Google Scholar). Within the large family of Shaker-like potassium channels, the selective subunit assembly includes heteromultimer formation of distinct pore-forming α-subunits and/or assembly of different kinds of subunits such as the α-subunits and hydrophilic cytoplasmic β-subunit(s) (7Scott V.E. Rettig J. Parcej D.N. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B. Pongs O. Dolly J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1637-1641Google Scholar, 8Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Google Scholar). Together, these give rise to the vast heterogeneity of K+currents. Changes in expression of a given subunit may alter the composition of heteromultimers in vivo, which would allow a cell to tune its K+ current system(s) during development and in response to changes in the cellular environment. There are more than 60 cloned genes encoding functional Shaker-like α-subunits, which have been divided into several subfamilies. Among them, subunits in the Kv1 to Kv5 subfamily are capable of functional homomeric channels in heterologous systems, such as Xenopusoocytes (9Butler A. Wei A. Salkoff L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2173-2174Google Scholar, 10Wei A. Covarrubias M. Butler A. Baker K. Pak M. Salkoff L. Science. 1990; 248: 599-603Google Scholar, 11Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A.

Channels. 1995; 3: 51-60Google Scholar). Four α-subunits within a given subfamily can form a functional channel either as a homotetramer or a heterotetramer (14MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Google Scholar,15Li M. Unwin N. Stauffer K.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4(2): 110-115Google Scholar). In the case of auxiliary subunits in animals, four genes encoding β-subunits for Shaker-like potassium channels have been well characterized: Kvβ1, Kvβ2, Kvβ3 (which has now been suggested to be a splice variant of Kvβ1), and Hk (7Scott V.E.

These β-subunits share at least 85% amino acid sequence identity in their COOH-terminal core regions, but differ significantly in length and sequence of the remaining NH2-terminal regions. Despite the remarkable sequence similarity among different β-subunits, their functional effects are quite different. For example, coexpression of β-subunits with certain α-subunits in Xenopus oocytes induces pronounced alterations in channel kinetic properties, most noticeably acceleration of fast inactivation by either Kvβ1 or Kvβ3 (8Rettig J.

Kvβ2, on the other hand, binds to α-subunits, such as Kv1.2 (or RCK5) (21Parcej D.N. Scott V.E. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11084-11088Google Scholar). However, it has little effect on inactivation of α-subunits such as Kv1.2 (RCK5) (7Scott V.E. Rettig J. Parcej D.N. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B. Pongs O. Dolly J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent data have shown that Kvβ2 is capable of increasing the surface expression of certain K+ channels in transfected cells (24Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K. Schechter L. Trimmer J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence has indicated that there are more than one β-subunit present in each K+ channel complex (21Parcej D.N. Scott V.E. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11084-11088Google Scholar). Given that cloned β-subunits have different modulatory effects on α-subunits, it would be interesting to test whether different β-subunits can interact with each other, which could be an important mechanism to increase the diversity of potassium currents. To test this hypothesis, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to study the interaction specificity of Kvβ2 with various α- and β-subunits. The functional consequences of heteromeric α-β and β-β interactions were evaluated by electrophysiological analyses. Plasmid vector construction was performed according to standard recombinant DNA techniques (26Sambrook J. Fristsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The vectors that express partial cDNA fragments were constructed by a high fidelity polymerase chain reaction cloning strategy according to the procedures described by Li et al.(27Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used are listed in Table I. In yeast, the expression of different fusion proteins of α-subunits, Kvβ1, and Kvβ2 was carried out by inserting the corresponding cDNA fragments into the SmaI/NotI,SalI/NotI, or BglII/NotI sites of pPC97 and pPC86 vectors (28Yu W.F.

The liquid junction potential was calculated to be 7.2 mV using JPCalc software (34Barry P.H. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1994; 51: 107-116Google Scholar) and corrected from the holding potential. Typically, the cell was held at −87 mV, and the holding voltage was then jumped from this potential up to a test potential of +53 mV in 10-mV increments for 300 ms. Current data were filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 100-μs intervals. Data analysis was done using clampfit software (pCLAMP6, Axon Instrument, Foster City, CA). A standard formula to compare two proportions was used to determine the statistical significance of different pairs of sample sets (35Pagano M. Gauvreau K. Principles of Biostatistics. Duxbury Press, Belmont, CA1993Google Scholar). We have used τ = 64 ms as the cutoff to separate populations with or without fast inactivation. In this analysis, the one-sided z test statistics were calculated using the following formula z = θ1-θ2 /{θp(1-θp)[1/n 1+ (1/n 2)]}0.5, where θ1 and θ2 are sample proportions that showed fast inactivation of each given group, θp is the weighted average of the sample proportions, andn 1 and n 2 are sample sizes. The interaction between α-subunits and Kvβ1 has been studied in more detail. In particular, the α-β complex is assembled, at least in part, by the association of the conserved core regions in Kvβ1 with NABKv1 of α-subunits, a critical assembly motif located in the hydrophilic NH2-terminal domains (28Yu W.F.

The formation of an α-β complex presumably recruits the inactivation particle of Kvβ1 close to the “receptor” site, thereby either accelerating the rate of inactivation of α-subunits of Kv1.4 (RCK4) and ShB (or H4) or inducing inactivation of compatible α-subunits which lack intrinsic fast inactivation, such as ShBΔ(6–46) (28Yu W.F. Xu J. Li M. Neuron. 1996; 16: 441-453Google Scholar, 36Sewing S. Roeper J. Pongs O. Neuron. 1996; 16: 455-463Google Scholar). Because the formation of the α-Kvβ1 complexes is subfamily-specific,i.e. Kvβ1 binds only to the NH2-terminal domains of Kv1 α-subunits (28Yu W.F. Xu J. Li M. Neuron. 1996; 16: 441-453Google Scholar), this allows Kvβ1 to selectively modulate a subset of α-subunits. To investigate whether Kvβ2 alters the electrophysiological properties of α-subunits in transfected mammalian cells, we have constructed two plasmids that express either Kvβ1 or Kvβ2 with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody tag fused at the COOH terminus of each coding sequence (see “Materials and Methods”). Both plasmids use the Kvβ1 5′-untranslated sequence. Thus, the two expression vectors are identical except for the amino acid coding sequence. Experiments utilizing these constructs permit better comparison of Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 expression and their ability to modulate α-subunits. By transient transfection in COS cells, we functionally expressed ShBΔ(6–46), a mutated ShB potassium channel that lacks the inactivation gate (37Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Google Scholar, 38Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 568-571Google Scholar). The Kvβ2 effects on this α-subunit were studied by whole-cell voltage clamp recording. Fig.1 A shows a series of traces obtained by stepping up from a holding potential of −87 mV to a final test potential of +33 mV in 20-mV increments. The recorded cells were transfected with ShBΔ(6–46) alone (upper panel), ShBΔ(6–46) in the presence of either Kvβ1 (middle panel), or Kvβ2 (bottom panel). In contrast to the ShBΔ(6–46) + Kvβ1 cotransfection in which we observed the Kvβ1-mediated inactivation (Fig. 1 A, middle panel), expression of ShBΔ(6–46) in the presence of Kvβ2 resulted in no detectable changes of the fast inactivation properties (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel). When traces were averaged within the group of ShBΔ(6–46) + Kvβ2 (n = 12) or ShBΔ(6–46) alone (n = 17), we observed little variations of inactivation properties between these two groups of recorded cells (Fig.1 B). To examine the protein expression of Kvβ2 in the experiments, total cell lysates from the transfected cells were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The expression of Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 was detected by immunoblot using the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (mAb12CA5). Indeed, Kvβ2 was found to express in the transfected COS cells and exhibited higher expression as compared with that of Kvβ1 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1 and 2). The higher expression of Kvβ2 has been reproducible in multiple transfection experiments. 1M. Bezanilla, J. Xu, and M. Li, unpublished results. The strong mAb12CA5 binding signal indicates that the failure of Kvβ2 to modulate N-type fast inactivation was not due to the lower protein expression of Kvβ2. Thus, Kvβ2 differs from Kvβ1 and by itself fails to induce the fast inactivation of the ShB α-subunit. Biochemical characterization supports direct physical interaction between Kvβ2 and Kv1.2 (RCK5) (7Scott V.E. Rettig J. Parcej D.N. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B. Pongs O. Dolly J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1637-1641Google Scholar, 21Parcej D.N. Scott V.E. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11084-11088Google Scholar) as well as Kv1.4 (RCK4) (39Rhodes K.J. Keilbaugh S.A. Barrezueta N.X. Lopez K.L. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5360-5371Google Scholar). However, the existing results for Kvβ2 binding specificity and region(s) involved are not conclusive (Ref. 23Nakahira K. Shi G. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7084-7089Google Scholar, also see “Discussion”). In addition, there is no information on whether Kvβ2 binds to ShB. To test the association between Kvβ2 and Kv1 α-subunits, we expressed various regions of α-subunits and Kvβ2 in yeast and used the yeast two-hybrid system to study the potential interaction(s) (30Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Google Scholar, 31Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Google Scholar). In the case of Kvβ1, it has been found that the NH2-terminal domains of the Kv1 α-subunits are involved in the α-Kvβ1 interaction (28Yu W.F. Xu J. Li M. Neuron. 1996; 16: 441-453Google Scholar, 36Sewing S. Roeper J. Pongs O. Neuron. 1996; 16: 455-463Google Scholar). Because Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 share considerable sequence homology, we first tested the potential interaction of Kvβ2 with the cytoplasmic regions of the Kv1.4, an α-subunit which has been found to interact with Kvβ2 (39Rhodes K.J. Keilbaugh S.A. Barrezueta N.X. Lopez K.L. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5360-5371Google Scholar). The truncated cytoplasmic fragments, i.e. the NH2-terminal domain (aa 2The abbreviation used is: aa, amino acids. 1–306) and COOH-terminal domain (aa 566–651), were expressed individually with Kvβ2 as GAL4 fusion proteins. If Kvβ2 interacts with one or both truncated Kv1.4 fragments, the resultant interaction(s) should confer the ability of the yeast transformants to grow on synthetic medium lacking histidine. Fig.2 A shows that when Kvβ2 was expressed alone either as a fusion protein of the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4-DB) or that of the GAL4 transcription activation domain (GAL4-TA), the yeast transformants grew on double selection medium supplemented with histidine, indicating that they carry both plasmids (Fig.2 A, numbers 1 and 2, middle left panel). When the same number of transformants were tested to grow on the triple selection medium lacking histidine, they showed no growth (Fig. 2 A, numbers 1 and 2, lower left panel). This indicates that Kvβ2 itself does not exert any endogenous activity that permits the yeast transformants to grow on the selection medium. By contrast, the coexpression of Kvβ2 and the NH2-terminal domain (Fig. 2 A, number 3), not the COOH-terminal domain (Fig. 2 A, number 4) of Kv1.4, resulted in growth on the selection medium lacking histidine. Consistent results have been obtained using a β-galactosidase assay (data not shown). Thus, similar to Kvβ1, Kvβ2 interacts with the NH2-terminal domain of the Kv1.4 α-subunit. The ability of Kvβ2 to interact with the NH2-terminal domain of Kv1.4 suggests that the resultant association may be essential for Kvβ2 to interact with α-subunits, as seen in biochemical copurification. In the case of Kvβ1, its subfamily-specific association with the NH2-terminal domains of Kv1 α-subunits has been shown to be essential for the Kvβ1-mediated inactivation (28Yu W.F. Xu J. Li M. Neuron. 1996; 16: 441-453Google Scholar, 36Sewing S. Roeper J. Pongs O. Neuron. 1996; 16: 455-463Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation of K+ channel polypeptides in rat brain has indicated that Kvβ2 interacts with Kv1.2 and Kv1.4, but not Kv2.1 (24Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K. Schechter L. Trimmer J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Google Scholar, 39Rhodes K.J. Keilbaugh S.A. Barrezueta N.X. Lopez K.L. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5360-5371Google Scholar). To further test the specificity of the Kvβ2, pairwise combinations of Kvβ2 and the NH2-terminal domains of eight different α-subunits were analyzed with the yeast two-hybrid system. The eight α-subunits included were: Shaker B (40Kamb A. Iverson L.E. Tanouye M.A. Cell. 1987; 50: 405-413Google Scholar, 41Tempel B.L. Papazian D.M. Schwarz T.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Brown A.M. Joho R.H. Nature. 1989; 340: 642-645Google Scholar), Kv3.1 (or NGK2b) (45Yokoyama S. Imoto K. Kawamura T. Higashida H. Iwabe N. Miyata T. Numa S.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1798-1802Google Scholar) from rat. These genes belong to the four major subfamilies, one fly gene and one rat gene for each subfamily. Among the selected NH2-terminal domains, Kvβ2 interacts only with the NH2-terminal domains of ShB and Kv1.4 (Fig.3 B, numbers 1 and 5), both of which belong to the Kv1 subfamily. Furthermore, the Kvβ2 interacting site was mapped to aa 174–306 within the NH2-terminal domain of Kv1.4 (data not shown), which coincides precisely with the domain that interacts with Kvβ1 (28Yu W.F. Xu J. Li M. Neuron. 1996; 16: 441-453Google Scholar, 36Sewing S. Roeper J. Pongs O. Neuron. 1996; 16: 455-463Google Scholar). Thus, both Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 interact subfamily-specifically with the Kv1 α-subunits and share the same binding site on the α-subunits. Based on the hydrodynamic estimates, the α-dendrotoxin acceptor (or Kv1.2) complex contains more than one Kvβ2 subunit per complex (21Parcej D.N. Scott V.E. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11084-11088Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether Kvβ2 can form an oligomeric complex in the absence of α-subunits. Additionally, since expression patterns of Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 overlapin vivo (8Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Google Scholar, 22Scott V.E.S. Parcej D.N. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.C. Dolly J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20094-20097Google Scholar, 39Rhodes K.J. Keilbaugh S.A.

Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4846-4860Google Scholar), it would be interesting to examine whether different β-subunits can interact with each other to form heteromultimers. Fig. 3 shows that Kvβ2 can indeed associate to form homomultimers as the yeast transformants grow in the selection medium lacking histidine (Fig. 3, number 3). The known potassium channels in yeast have distinctive topology and belong to a subclass different from the Shaker-like potassium channels (48Ketchum K.A. Joiner W.J. Sellers A.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Nature. 1995; 376: 690-695Google Scholar). Therefore, the above result supports that Kvβ2 is capable of interacting with itself in the absence of α-subunits. Both Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 are expressed in rat brain with overlapping expression patterns (8Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Google Scholar, 22Scott V.E.S. Parcej D.N. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.C. Dolly J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20094-20097Google Scholar, 39Rhodes K.J. Keilbaugh S.A. Barrezueta N.X. Lopez K.L. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5360-5371Google Scholar). Because Kvβ2 forms multimers in the absence of α-subunits (Fig. 3, number 3) and has considerable overall sequence homology (73%) to Kvβ1, we tested the possible interaction between Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 and found that Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 can also interact (Fig. 3, number 4). This implies that Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 can form heteromultimers in the absence of the pore-forming α-subunits. Both Kvβ2 and Kvβ1 interact with the Kv1 α-subunits by recognizing the same region in the Kv1 α-subunits (Fig. 2 and Ref. 28Yu W.F. Xu J. Li M. Neuron. 1996; 16: 441-453Google Scholar). Additionally, Kvβ2 interacts with itself and/or Kvβ1 to form homo- and/or heteromultimers (Fig. 3). Because Kvβ1, not Kvβ2, induces the fast inactivation of the Kv1 α-subunits that lack fast inactivation (Fig.1), these data suggest that one potential function of Kvβ2 would be to alter the efficacy of the Kvβ1-mediated inactivation. One predicted outcome would be that Kvβ2 weakens the ability of Kvβ1 to inactivate, as Kvβ2 may compete with Kvβ1 for the binding site on α-subunits and/or associate with Kvβ1 to form Kvβ1-Kvβ2 heteromultimers containing fewer inactivation particles. One experiment to test this hypothesis would be to coexpress Kvβ1 and a compatible α-subunit in the presence or absence of Kvβ2 and ask whether Kvβ2 alters the ability of Kvβ1 to inactivate. We cotransfected COS cells with noninactivating ShBΔ(6–46) and Kvβ1 in a 1:6 plasmid ratio of α/Kvβ1. Fig. 4 Ashows three representative traces, one from each group, that were superimposed and normalized. These traces were recorded by stepping up the holding potential from −87 mV to a test potential of +13 mV for a duration of 300 ms. ShBΔ(6–46) alone produced a trace with fast activating kinetics lacking N-type fast inactivation. When Kvβ1 was included in the transfection, we observed a majority of transfected cells that show the Kvβ1-mediated fast inactivation (Fig.4 A). If, however, both Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 were included in a plasmid ratio of α/Kvβ1/Kvβ2 of 1:6:5, much fewer transfected cells showed fast interaction induced by Kvβ1 (see below and Fig.4 B). The lack of fast inactivation by Kvβ1 in the presence of Kvβ2 in the example shown in Fig. 4 A could have resulted from variable transfection rates of the three plasmids. To address this, we recorded 17 Shaker-positive cells for the ShBΔ(6–46) transfection, 40 cells for the ShBΔ(6–46) + Kvβ1 transfection, 44 cells for the ShBΔ(6–46) + Kvβ1 + Kvβ2 transfection. Since recorded cells were selected solely based on the presence of Shaker current and the expression of CD4 antigen that was cotransfected in all experiments, the percentage of recorded cells in a given transfection shown, fast and/or slow inactivation can then be determined. Among the recorded traces, some exhibited both fast and slow inactivation, the others showed only slow inactivation. The traces were fit by a double exponential function, and the resultant inactivation constants were plotted against the cell number in percentage (Fig. 4 B). Fig. 4 B shows plots using one inactivation constant per recorded cell, i.e. if the inactivation consists of two (fast and slow) components, only the fast inactivation constant was plotted. For the ShBΔ(6–46) transfection, we observed that all recorded cells lacked the fast inactivation and gave a slow inactivation constant (τ2) larger tha"

In Chlamydomonas eugametos, however, the chloroplast clpP gene predicted a much larger ClpP protein containing large insertion sequences (ISs). One insertion sequence, IS2, is 456 amino acid residues long and not similar to known proteins. Here we show that IS2 is an unusual intein, and its protein splicing activity in Escherichia coli cells can be activated by a single amino acid substitution. Analysis of IS2 sequence revealed short sequence motifs that are similar to known intein motifs, including putative LAGLI-DADG endonuclease motifs. But a histidine residue conserved at the C terminus of known inteins is replaced in the IS2 sequence by a glycine residue (Gly455), rendering the IS2 sequence incapable of detectable protein splicing when tested inE. coli cells. Changing Gly455 to histidine activated the ability of IS2 to undergo protein splicing in E. coli cells. The IS2 sequence (intein) was precisely excised from a precursor protein, with the flanking sequences (exteins) joined together by a normal peptide bond.

The IS2 sequence (intein) was precisely excised from a precursor protein, with the flanking sequences (exteins) joined together by a normal peptide bond. An intein is defined as a protein sequence embedded in frame within a precursor protein sequence that is spliced out during maturation (1Perler F.B. Davis E.O. Dean G.E. Gimble F.S. Jack W.E. Neff N.

This maturation process, termed protein splicing, involves the precise excision of the intein sequence and the formation of a normal peptide bond joining the external sequences (exteins). Protein splicing can therefore be considered the protein equivalent of RNA splicing and adds another layer of complexity to the central dogma of molecular biology. Inteins have been found in all three kingdoms of living organisms and in an increasing number of proteins. These include the 69-kDa catalytic subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (VMA) 1The abbreviations used are: VMA, vacuolar H+-ATPase; IS, insertion sequence; MBP, maltose-binding protein; IPTG, isopropyl-1thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Kane P.M.

Recent determination of the complete genome sequence of the methanogenic archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii revealed 18 putative intein sequences encoded in 14 genes (30Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. et al.Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Google Scholar). Most inteins have sequence motifs similar to homing endonucleases of self-splicing introns (10Shub D.A. Goodrich-Blair H. Cell. 1992; 71: 183-186Google Scholar,11Gimble F.S. Thorner J. J. Biol.

Nature. 1992; 357: 301-306Google Scholar). The inheritance of inteins could therefore be either horizontal (intein homing) or vertical (normal chromosomal transmission). Many intein sequences were sufficient for protein splicing when placed within a foreign or target protein immediately before a nucleophilic residue (3Davis E.O. Jenner P.J. Brooks P.C. Colston M.J. Sedgwick S.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 201-210Google Scholar, 13Cooper A.A. Chen Y.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2575-2583Google Scholar, 14Xu M.-Q. Southworth M.W. Mersha F.B. Hornstra L.J. Perler F.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 1371-1377Google Scholar), suggesting that all cis information required for protein splicing is contained within the intein. Protein splicing occurred when intein-containing proteins were produced in a wide range of heterologous contexts, including an in vitrosplicing system (14Xu M.-Q. Southworth M.W. Mersha F.B. Hornstra L.J. Perler F.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 1371-1377Google Scholar), suggesting that the reaction is autocatalytic. Identified inteins range in size from 360 to 537 amino acid residues and have little sequence identity, although a number of short sequence motifs have been recognized that show a significant degree of conservation (9Pietrokovski S. Protein. Sci. 1994; 3: 2340-2350Google Scholar). Several models for protein splicing mechanisms have been proposed (8Hodges R.A. Perler F.B. Noren C.J. Jack W.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6153-6157Google Scholar, 14Xu M.-Q. Southworth M.W. Mersha F.B. Hornstra L.J. Perler F.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 1371-1377Google Scholar, 15Wallace C.J. Protein.

Sci. 1995; 20: 351-356Google Scholar). They generally involve an N → O acyl shift (or N → S shift) at the splice sites (18Shao Y. Xu M.Q. Paulus H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3810-3815Google Scholar), formation of a branched intermediate (19Xu M.Q. Comb D.G. Paulus H. Noren C.J. Shao Y. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5517-5522Google Scholar), and cyclization of an invariant Asn residue at the C terminus of intein to succinimide (20Shao Y. Xu M.Q. Paulus H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10844-10850Google Scholar), leading to excision of the intein and ligation of the exteins. ClpP is the catalytic subunit of the ATP-dependent and proteasome-like Clp protease that is widespread, if not ubiquitous, among prokaryotes and eukaryotic cell organelles (21Maurizi M.R. Clark W.P. Kim S.-H. Gottesman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12546-12552Google Scholar, 22Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol.

Genes for the ClpP protease have been characterized in many chloroplast genomes, and these invariably predicted ClpP proteins that are similar to bacterial and mitochondrial ClpP proteins in size and amino acid sequence (21Maurizi M.R.

Knudsen I. Kruse T.A. Gregersen N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 249-252Google Scholar). In the green alga Chlamydomonas, however, sequence determination of the chloroplast clpP gene revealed the presence of large translated insertion sequences (26Huang C. Wang S. Chen L. Lemieux C. Otis C. Turmel M. Liu X.Q. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 151-159Google Scholar). TheChlamydomonas eugametos chloroplast clpP gene predicted a protein sequence of 1010 residues long, which is five times the size of a typical ClpP protein. This unusually large size was entirely due to the presence of large translated insertion sequences. The largest insertion sequence, IS2, is 456 residues long, not present in several other Chlamydomonas species examined, and not similar to known proteins. Here we show that IS2 is a modified intein with many of the recognized intein motifs. IS2 apparently lost an important histidine residue that is conserved in known inteins, and restoring this histidine residue activated the protein-splicing activity of IS2 in Escherichia coli cells. A 2-kilobase pairBamHI-XhoI (blunt-ended) DNA fragment, corresponding to the 3′-two-thirds of the ClpP coding sequence, was cloned into the expression plasmid vector pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs) at the BamHI-SalI (blunt-ended) site, so that the ClpP coding sequence was in frame with the upstream vector-encoded maltose-binding protein (MBP) coding sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis method, using a mutagenic oligonucleotide primer containing the desired mutations. The mutagenized DNA fragment was used to substitute the corresponding DNA fragment in the recombinant pMAL-c2 plasmids containing the ClpP-coding sequence. The nucleotide sequence of the mutagenized DNA fragment was determined to confirm the presence of the specified mutations and the absence of unwanted mutations. Insertion of the ctag sequence was carried out by first cutting the target DNA with restriction enzymeSpeI, filling in the resulting 3′-recessed ends with Klenow DNA polymerase and dNTPs, and then performing religation of the resulting blunt ends. E. colicells containing the recombinant plasmid were grown in liquid Lurie Broth medium at 37 °C to late log phase (A600, 0.5). IPTG was added at this time to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce the production of IS2-containing fusion proteins. After 2 h of induction, cells were harvested, lysed by sonication, and separated into soluble and insoluble fractions when required. Cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. When needed, a protein band of interest was excised from the stained gel, and the protein was electroeluted. Western blotting analysis was carried out using the anti-MBP antiserum from New England Biolabs. The amount of protein in individual protein bands was estimated by using a gel documentation system (Gel Doc 1000 coupled with Molecular Analyst software, Bio-Rad). For treatment with protease Factor Xa, electroeluted protein was first dialyzed against a Factor Xa reaction buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2). 1 μg of Factor Xa was then added to every 10 μg of protein substrate and incubated at 23 °C for a specified length of time. Resulting protein fragments were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electrotransfer. The membrane was then stained in a Ponceau S staining solution (0.2% Ponceau S, 1% acetic acid in water) to visualize protein bands. The area of the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane containing the protein of interest was cut out and used for peptide analysis and protein sequencing. Peptide analysis and protein microsequencing were carried out at the Microchemistry Facility of Harvard University. Proteins deposited on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were subjected to in situ (on the membrane) tryptic digest using protease trypsin, and the resulting tryptic peptides were fractionated using high-performance liquid chromatography. Fractions suspected of containing peptides of interest were analyzed by mass spectrometry to determine the precise mass of the peptides, using matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry performed on a Finnigan (Hemel, United Kingdom) Lasermat 2000. When needed, peptides identified by mass were subjected to further identification by protein microsequencing. The insertion sequence IS2 of C. eugametos chloroplast ClpP (26Huang C. Wang S. Chen L. Lemieux C. Otis C. Turmel M. Liu X.Q. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 151-159Google Scholar) was analyzed for the possible presence of intein-like features. This analysis revealed short sequence motifs (Fig. 1) that showed significant similarity to each of the seven conserved sequence motifs (A to G) recognized previously in known inteins (9Pietrokovski S. Protein. Sci. 1994; 3: 2340-2350Google Scholar), including motifs C and E that are putative endonuclease motifs (10Shub D.A. Goodrich-Blair H. Cell. 1992; 71: 183-186Google Scholar, 12Gimble F.S. Thorner J. Nature. 1992; 357: 301-306Google Scholar). These intein-like sequence motifs of IS2 are similar to corresponding motifs of known inteins both in primary sequences and in relative positions, although the remaining part of the IS2 sequence does not have significant sequence similarity to any of the known inteins. The IS2 sequence is bounded by a pair of nucleophilic residues (Cys and Ser) and has an Asn residue at its C terminus. These three residues have been shown in known inteins to be critical for protein splicing (14Xu M.-Q. Southworth M.W. Mersha F.B. Hornstra L.J. Perler F.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 1371-1377Google Scholar, 18Shao Y. Xu M.Q. Paulus H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3810-3815Google Scholar, 19Xu M.Q. Comb D.G. Paulus H. Noren C.J. Shao Y. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5517-5522Google Scholar, 20Shao Y. Xu M.Q. Paulus H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10844-10850Google Scholar, 27Hirata R. Anraku Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 40-47Google Scholar). A His residue located immediately before the C-terminal Asn residue is also conserved in known inteins and thought to be important for protein splicing (13Cooper A.A. Chen Y.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2575-2583Google Scholar, 15Wallace C.J. Protein. Sci. 1993; 2: 697-705Google Scholar). Notably, this position in the IS2 sequence is occupied by a Gly residue. To examine whether the IS2 sequence can support protein splicing, we constructed recombinant plasmids that encode IS2-containing fusion proteins (Fig. 2). In addition to the unmodified (wild-type) IS2 coding sequence, mutant IS2 coding sequences generated through site-directed mutagenesis were also included. One mutation changed a ggt codon to acat codon in the DNA sequence, resulting in a substitution of the corresponding Gly residue (Gly455) by a His residue in the protein sequence. This substitution is located immediately before the C-terminal Asn residue of IS2. Another mutation inserted a 4-base sequence in the DNA, creating a translation termination codon (tag) at this position located 150 base pairs before the 3′-end of the IS2 coding sequence. Each IS2 coding sequence was flanked on both sides by in-frame coding sequences of other polypeptides: the 42-kDa MBP linked to a 105-residue ClpP sequence (SD2a) on the N-terminal side and a 107-residue ClpP sequence (SD2b) on the C-terminal side. Each of these recombinant plasmids was introduced into E. coli cells to produce the corresponding fusion protein and to observe possible protein-splicing products (Fig. 3). In cells containing the unmodified IS2 sequence, only an unprocessed precursor protein (117 kDa) was observed after staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 3 A), indicating that the wild-type IS2 sequence was incapable of efficient protein splicing under these conditions. When the IS2 sequence was modified by substituting the Gly455 residue near its C terminus by a His residue, a putative spliced protein (66 kDa) was readily observed (Fig. 3 A, lane 3), indicating that the single Gly → His substitution activated the ability of IS2 to undergo protein splicing. As controls, mutant IS2 sequences containing a termination codon, with or without the Gly → His substitution, resulted in only a truncated precursor protein. An excised IS2 polypeptide (calculated size, 55 kDa) was not observed, presumably failing to accumulate to a detectable level under the conditions used. Accumulation of the 117-kDa precursor protein in cells containing the modified IS2 construct indicated that the protein splicing did not proceed to completion. Most of the 117-kDa precursor protein was found in the insoluble fraction of the cell lysate (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2–4), suggesting that its accumulation was due to misfolding or formation of inclusion bodies. The 66-kDa spliced protein also accumulated in the insoluble fraction of the cell lysate. The insolubility of both proteins was most likely caused by the presence of incomplete ClpP sequences in these proteins. Small amounts of the 117-kDa precursor protein and the 66-kDa spliced protein remained soluble and could be partially purified by using an amylose resin affinity column (Fig. 3 B, lane 5). This is consistent with the expectation that both proteins contain MBP that binds to amylose resin. We were unable to make the purified precursor protein to undergo protein splicing in vitro, probably because the precursor protein was trapped in a misfolded conformation. Western blotting was carried out as a more sensitive method to detect and identify the spliced protein, using an antiserum against the MBP sequence of the fusion proteins. Both the 117-kDa precursor protein and the 66-kDa spliced protein were recognized by the antiserum (Fig.3 B, lane 8), which further supported the assignment of these two proteins. Additional protein bands located between the 117- and 66-kDa bands were also recognized by the anti-MBP antiserum, and they appeared more abundant in cells containing the wild-type IS2 sequence than in cells containing the modified IS2 sequence (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7 and 8). These bands likely represent protein-splicing intermediates or breakdown products. In cells containing the wild-type IS2 sequence, a Western blot revealed a weak band at a position corresponding to the 66-kDa spliced protein (Fig.3 B, lane 7). But it was not determined whether this weak band represents a small amount of the spliced protein or merely a protein breakdown product that migrates to that position. The 66-kDa protein was tentatively identified as the spliced protein because of its size, its binding to amylose resin, and its recognition by anti-MBP antiserum (Fig. 3). To confirm its identity further, the 66-kDa protein was electroeluted from SDS-polyacrylamide gels (see Fig. 3 A, lane 3) and subjected to further analysis. First, it was cleaved by the sequence-specific protease Factor Xa, which cuts at a known site located immediately after the MBP sequence. After incubation with Factor Xa for various lengths of time, the 66-kDa protein was cleaved into a 42-kDa fragment corresponding to MBP and a smaller fragment of 24 kDa in size (Fig. 4 A). The 24-kDa fragment was predicted to be a fusion product of the ClpP sequence domains SD2a and SD2b (see Fig. 2) as a result of protein splicing. To confirm this, the 24-kDa fragment was blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to peptide analysis and protein sequencing. After digestion of the 24-kDa fragment with protease trypsin, four of the resulting tryptic peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry to determine their precise masses. For each of the four peptides, the measured mass correlated very well with the theoretical mass of a predicted tryptic peptide of a spliced protein (Fig. 4 B). Among the four peptides, peptides p1 and p2 are within the SD2a sequence domain, and peptide p4 is within the SD2b sequence domain, whereas peptide p3 spans the spliced junction (Fig.4 B). Peptide p3 was then definitively identified by determining the first 30 residues of its sequence by protein microsequencing (Fig. 4 B). These results firmly identified the 66-kDa protein as a spliced protein produced by protein splicing, in which the IS2 sequence (intein) was precisely excised from the 117-kDa precursor protein, with the flanking sequences (exteins) joined together by a normal peptide bond (Fig.4 C). No RNA splicing was detected by Northern blotting or by a more sensitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method, although an unspliced RNA transcript was detected by Northern blotting (data not shown). This is consistent with the absence of recognizable RNA intron features in the IS2 coding sequence (26Huang C. Wang S. Chen L. Lemieux C. Otis C. Turmel M. Liu X.Q. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 151-159Google Scholar). Our observation that complete translation of the IS2 sequence is necessary for producing the 66-kDa spliced protein (Fig. 3 A) also argues against RNA splicing and translational bypassing (28Engelberg-Kulka H. Benhar I. Schoulaker-Schwarz R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 294-296Google Scholar). The insertion sequence IS2 of C. eugametos chloroplast ClpP protease was identified as an intein, not only by the presence in its sequence of recognizable intein motifs, but also by the observation of protein splicing of IS2-containing proteins in E. colicells. Identification of this chloroplast-encoded intein extended the distribution of intein-coding sequences to a cell organelle genome. Previously identified intein-coding sequences were found in a nuclear genome (2Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Wolczyk D.F. Neff N. Goebl M. Stevens T.H. Science. 1990; 250: 651-657Google Scholar, 7Gu H.H. Xu J. Gallagher M. Dean G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7372-7381Google Scholar), eubacterial genome (3Davis E.O. Jenner P.J. Brooks P.C. Colston M.J. Sedgwick S.G.

A. 1996; 93: 3410-3415Google Scholar), and archaebacterial genome (6Perler F.B. Comb D.G. Jack W.E. Moran L.S. Qiang B. Kucera R.B. Benner J. Slatko B.E. Nwankwo D.O. Hempstead S.K. Carlow C.K.S. Jannasch H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5577-5581Google Scholar). A 150-residue insertion sequence in the chloroplast DnaB protein of Porphyra purpurea was noted previously to also have some of the putative intein motifs (9Pietrokovski S. Protein. Sci. 1994; 3: 2340-2350Google Scholar, 29Reith M. Munholland J. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 13: 333-335Google Scholar), which may prove to be another intein encoded by a cell organelle genome. It was noted recently that inteins were found predominantly in proteins involved in DNA metabolism (5Fsihi H. Vincent V. Cole S.T Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3410-3415Google Scholar), which included DNA polymerases, a DNA recombinase, a DNA gyrase, and possibly a DNA helicase. The intein-containing ClpP protein, being a protease (21Maurizi M.R. Clark W.P. Kim S.-H. Gottesman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12546-12552Google Scholar, 22Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Kocsis E.

Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1713-1722Google Scholar) not known to interact with DNA, is therefore an exception. The ClpP IS2 intein apparently lost an important His residue (replaced by Gly455) that is highly conserved in known inteins. It takes a minimum of two nucleotide substitutions to change a His codon into a Gly codon, and no RNA editing is known in this organism. This suggests that the IS2 intein may be somewhat degenerate and may have accumulated additional, although less critical, mutations in other parts of its sequence. Although the IS2 intein apparently retains many of the putative intein motifs, the degree of overall sequence similarity between IS2 and other inteins is extremely low and practically undetectable. When only the seven conserved intein sequence motifs (a total of 93 positions) were compared, sequence identities between IS2 and other inteins range from 30% for the Pps1 intein ofM. leprae, 25% for the VMA1 intein of yeast, and 19% for the RecA intein of M. tuberculosis to much lower for others. Low sequence similarities between IS2 and other inteins may suggest independent origins, long periods of separate evolution, or low functional constraint. Although an origin of the ClpP IS2 intein is not known, it probably was acquired by C. eugametos relatively recently, because several other, closely relatedChlamydomonas species lack this intein (26Huang C. Wang S. Chen L. Lemieux C. Otis C. Turmel M. Liu X.Q. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 151-159Google Scholar). The ClpP IS2 intein contain two putative endonuclease motifs (C and E) that could be associated with intein mobility (intein homing), although endonuclease activity has not been detected. The ClpP IS2 intein was incapable of detectable protein splicing inE. coli cells under conditions used in this study, whereas replacing the single Gly455 residue with a His residue activated the protein-splicing activity. This suggests that a His residue at this position plays an important role in protein splicing, consistent with the observation that this His residue is highly conserved among known inteins. Although an explicit role for this conserved His residue has not been demonstrated in recent studies of protein-splicing mechanisms, it was proposed in an earlier model that this conserved His residue may assist the N → O acyl shift at the splice sites (15Wallace C.J. Protein. Sci. 1993; 2: 697-705Google Scholar). In the yeast VMA intein, experimentally replacing this His residue by a Gly residue completely abolished its protein-splicing activity, whereas replacement by Lys, Glu, Val, and Leu residues resulted in a lower rate of protein splicing (13Cooper A.A. Chen Y.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2575-2583Google Scholar). Interestingly, among the 18 putative intein sequences revealed recently in the M. jannaschii genome sequence, two of them also lack this conserved His residue (30Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. et al.Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Google Scholar). In the ClpP IS2 intein, the natural substitution of the conserved His residue by a Gly residue (Gly455) raises questions about the in vivo protein-splicing activity of this intein. The conserved His residue may not be required for efficient ClpP protein splicing in its native chloroplast environment, and the in vivo splicing might be assisted by unknown trans-acting factors. A slow splicing reaction may provide a means of regulating the ClpP protease activity, and an unexcised IS2 intein might also be tolerated under some conditions. Our effort in detecting the chloroplast ClpP protein (precursor or spliced protein) in C. eugametos cells by Western blotting has not been successful, presumably due to a combination of weak anti-ClpP antibodies used in the study and a low level of the ClpP protein in the cell. We thank Z. Hu for technical assistance in Western blot analysis. We also thank Drs. F. Doolittle, M. Gray, R. Singer, and C. Wallace for helpful discussions of this work."

Mutations that decreased the susceptibility of thrombin to inhibition by antithrombin III in the presence and absence of heparin (W50A, E229A, and R233A) also decreased hydrolysis of a small tripeptidyl substrate.

The predominant mechanism for the clearance of thrombin is through inhibition by antithrombin III (ATIII), 1The abbreviation used is: ATIII, antithrombin III. 1The abbreviation used is: ATIII, antithrombin III. a member of the family of serine protease inhibitors known as serpins (1Rosenberg R.D.

Preissner K.T. Ofosu F.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 405-412Google Scholar). The physiological importance of this process is illustrated by the observation that individuals possessing inherited ATIII deficiency or insufficiency are subject to recurrent thrombosis (12Perry D.J. Carrell R.W. Hum. Mutat. 1996; 7: 7-22Google Scholar). ATIII is a 58-kDa glycoprotein that inhibits thrombin in two kinetically distinct steps: the formation of a weak initial complex followed by rapid conversion to a stable complex (13Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14891-14895Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structures of ATIII (14Mourey L. Samama J.P. Delarue M. Choay J. Lormeau J.C. Petitou M. Moras D. Biochimie. 1990; 72: 599-608Google Scholar) and other serpins in cleaved (15Löbermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Google Scholar, 16Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Google Scholar) and uncleaved (17Stein P.E. Leslie A.G. Finch J.T. Turnell W.G. McLaughlin P.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1990; 347: 99-102Google Scholar) forms, inhibition has been proposed to proceed through the recognition of the Arg393-Ser394bond in an exposed loop of ATIII as a substrate. However, upon cleavage, a conformational change in the inhibitor has been proposed to result in the trapping of the enzyme either as a tetrahedral intermediate or as an acyl-enzyme. Unlike the intermediate typically formed with substrates, the intermediate formed between thrombin and ATIII is stable and resistant to hydrolysis perhaps due to the conformational change which may exclude water from the active site (9Olson S.T. Bjork I. Berliner L.J. Thrombin Structure and Function. Plenum Press, New York1992: 159-217Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step in the inhibition of thrombin by ATIII is the formation of the initial complex (∼2 × 105m−1 min−1) which can be accelerated by 3 orders of magnitude (∼2 × 108m−1 min−1) in the presence of the glycosaminoglycan, heparin. Acceleration by heparin appears to be mediated by two processes. The formation of a binary complex between ATIII and heparin induces a conformational change in ATIII that enhances association with thrombin and the interaction of heparin with binding sites on both thrombin and ATIII in the ternary complex slows the dissociation of the initial complex. The analysis of naturally occurring mutants of ATIII has allowed extensive assignment of structure-function relationships. Mutations that affect inhibition of thrombin appear to fall into three functional classes that are spatially distinct (9Olson S.T. Bjork I. Berliner L.J. Thrombin Structure and Function. Plenum Press, New York1992: 159-217Google Scholar, 10Broze Jr G.J. Tollefsen D.M. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A.W. Majerus P.W. Varmus H. The Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. W. B.

Mutations that map to the substrate loop of ATIII perturb direct interactions with thrombin and result in diminished potency or altered specificity of inhibition. Mutation of a cluster of positively charged residues that stretches from the base of the A helix across the D helix and extends toward the substrate loop affects heparin binding. Mutations in the sequences flanking the substrate loop limit the conformational change that accompanies inhibition and cause a loss of inhibitory activity or convert ATIII into a substrate. Mutations involving residues outside of the substrate loop of ATIII that are directly involved in interactions with thrombin have not been described. The predominant structural features of the thrombin molecule include a deep canyon-like active site cleft formed between extended loops Leu46-Asn57 and Leu144-Gly155 that sterically restricts the substrate specificity of thrombin and two positively charged surfaces termed exosites I and II that are involved in supplementary interactions with many macromolecular substrates and inhibitors of thrombin (19Bode W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Google Scholar). No studies have identified direct interactions between residues outside of the active site cleft of thrombin and ATIII. We were interested in characterizing the interaction of thrombin with ATIII because naturally occurring mutations within the functional epitope may predispose individuals to thrombotic disease just as analogous functionally deficient variants of ATIII are prothrombotic (10Broze Jr G.J.

In addition, the in vivo potency of a novel class of anticoagulant agents, where thrombin has been genetically engineered to function selectively as an activator of endogenous protein C (31Gibbs C.S.

Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Google Scholar), can be modulated by altering clearance by ATIII. To identify residues on thrombin that are important for inhibition by ATIII, including residues outside of the active site cleft, we constructed a library of site-directed mutants of thrombin in which a total of 79 residues that are most exposed on the surface of thrombin were mutated to alanine (34Tsiang M. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E. Rojas M.E. Leung L.L.K. Gibbs C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16854-16863Google Scholar). This library of mutants was screened for its sensitivity to inhibition by ATIII in the presence and absence of heparin and the functional requirements for ATIII inhibition were compared with those required for the hydrolysis of a small peptidyl substrate that interacts only with the active site cleft. The human prothrombin gene was inserted into the expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). Codons for the 79 polar and charged amino acids that displayed greater than 35% fractional accessibility to a solvent probe of radius 1.4 Å were mutated to alanine by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Mutant prothrombin in conditioned medium from transiently transfected COS-7 cells was concentrated by ultrafiltration, processed to thrombin by Echis carinatus venom, and quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All these methods have been described in detail previously (32Tsiang M. Paborsky L.R. Li W.-X. Jain A.K. Mao C.T. Dunn K.E. Lee D.W. Matsumura S.Y. Matteucci M.D. Coutré S.E. Leung L.L.K. Gibbs C.S.

Thrombin mutants in conditioned media were first assayed for amidolytic activity at 100 μm S-2238 (H-d-Phe-Pip-Arg-p-nitroanilide) in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 150 mm NaCl. An amount of mutant thrombin that gave a change in absorbance of 0.01A 405/min was then used for each substrate concentration point for the K m determination. The final concentration of thrombin in the reaction was ∼0.74 nm for most mutants. The initial rates of S-2238 hydrolysis were measured, by monitoring the absorbance change at 405 nm, at the following substrate concentrations: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 50, 70, and 100 μm. Kinetic parameters,k cat and K m were determined by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the data. Thrombin mutants were rapidly screened for resistance to inhibition by ATIII by diluting 0.5 pmol of thrombin mutant in selection buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) plus 0.1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 4.5 μg/ml Polybrene (to neutralize any contaminating heparinoids) in quadruplicate wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. The final reaction volume was 100 μl. Purified human ATIII (Enzyme Research Laboratories) was added to duplicate wells to a final concentration of 1.0 μm. The inhibition reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min and then stopped by the addition of 100 μm of the chromogenic substrate S-2238. The chromogenic substrate served a dual purpose, halting the inhibition reaction by competition and providing a means of quantitating the residual activity due to uninhibited thrombin. This was accomplished by monitoring the change in absorbance at 405 nm over a 2-min interval. Percent inhibition was calculated from the ratio of activity remaining in the presence versus the absence of ATIII. Under these conditions, wild-type thrombin was inhibited by 99%. Selected thrombin mutants were analyzed in more detail to determine the second-order rate constants for inhibition by ATIII alone. Between 2 and 5 pmol of each thrombin mutant was diluted into 200 μl of selection buffer plus 0.1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 4.5 μg/ml Polybrene containing 0.5–5 μm ATIII. The reaction was incubated at 25 °C and at regular intervals over a 30-min time course 20-μl samples were withdrawn and diluted into 180 μl of 100 μm S-2238 to terminate the reaction. The rate of hydrolysis of S-2238 due to residual uninhibited thrombin was determined by monitoring the change in absorbance at 405 nm. Under these pseudo-first order conditions the time course of inhibition was fitted to the equation: Et= E 0 e −k′t, whereE 0 is the thrombin activity at timet = 0, E t is the thrombin activity at time t, and k′ is the observed pseudo-first order rate constant. The second-order rate constant of inhibition (k 2) was calculated by dividing k′ by the ATIII concentration. Inhibition by ATIII in the presence of heparin was performed in the presence of competing substrate (S-2238) as described previously (30Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Google Scholar). Briefly, 150 nm ATIII, 0.2 unit/ml heparin, and 150 μm S-2238 were premixed in 590 μl of reaction buffer containing: 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% PEG-8000. This mixture was added to a spectrophotometric cuvette containing 10 μl of 300 nm mutant thrombin (final concentration of 5 nm), and hydrolysis of S-2238 was immediately measured for 2 min. The pseudo-first order rate constant of inhibition k′ was determined by curve fitting as described previously (32Tsiang M. Paborsky L.R. Li W.-X. Jain A.K. Mao C.T. Dunn K.E. Lee D.W. Matsumura S.Y. Matteucci M.D. Coutré S.E. Leung L.L.K. Gibbs C.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16449-16457Google Scholar). The second-order rate constant,k 2, was determined from k′ after correcting for substrate competition using the K m value of S-2238 hydrolysis (32Tsiang M. Paborsky L.R. Li W.-X. Jain A.K. Mao C.T. Dunn K.E. Lee D.W. Matsumura S.Y. Matteucci M.D. Coutré S.E. Leung L.L.K. Gibbs C.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16449-16457Google Scholar). Most of the thrombin mutants hydrolyzed the tripeptidyl chromogenic substrate S-2238 with catalytic efficiencies (k cat/K m) comparable to that of wild-type thrombin (∼40 s−1μm−1). Only 3 mutants (W50A, N53A/T55A, and E229A) displayed catalytic efficiencies that were reduced by greater than 5-fold relative to wild-type thrombin (Table I). Asn53 is the sole site of N-linked glycosylation in thrombin and its substitution may affect the thermal stability of mutant N53A/T55A (data not shown).Table IKinetic parameters of S-2238 hydrolysis by thrombin mutantsMutation1-aResidues numbered consecutively from the start of the thrombin B chain.

Open table in a new tab All 56 mutants were screened for inhibition by ATIII both in the presence and absence of heparin. Heparin-independent ATIII inhibition was determined at a single time point and expressed as percent inhibition. For ATIII inhibition in the presence of 0.2 unit/ml heparin, the second-order rate constant of inhibition k 2 was determined (Fig.1). Three mutants, W50A, E229A, and R233A were more resistant to inhibition by ATIII in the absence of heparin compared with wild-type thrombin. Predictably, these same three mutants were also refractory to heparin-dependent ATIII inhibition (Fig.1). In addition to the three mutants above, there were five additional mutants (R89A/R93A/E94A, R98A, R245A, K248A, and K252A/D255A/Q256A) that were refractory to ATIII inhibition only in the presence of heparin. Three other mutants (E25A, R178A/R180A/D183A, and E202A) displayed slightly increased sensitivity toward heparin-dependent ATIII inhibition (Fig. 1). The eight mutants found to be refractory to ATIII inhibition in the absence or presence of heparin were further analyzed in a time course assay for inhibition by ATIII alone. The second-order rate constant of inhibition in the absence of heparin,k 2, was determined and reported together with the k 2 for heparin-dependent ATIII inhibition (Table II). The k 2 of mutants W50A, E229A, and R233A was decreased by 6.3–14.7-fold for heparin-independent ATIII inhibition and similarly by 8.3–14.4-fold for heparin-dependent inhibition (Table II). These three mutations most probably weakened direct interactions between thrombin and ATIII.Table IIThrombin mutants resistant to inhibition by antithrombin IIIMutationk 2 × 10−5(ATIII)k 2 × 10−8 (ATIII + heparin)2-aHeparin was used at 0.2 unit/ml.m −1·min −1m −1·min −1Wild-type2.40 ± 0.10 (100)2-bThe values in parenthesis represent the fold decrease in rate relative to wild-type thrombin.2.16 ± 0.08 (1.00)Mutants with reduced inhibition by ATIII in the presence and absence of heparinW50A0.163 ± 0.005 (14.7)0.26 ± 0.01 (8.31)E229A0.384 ± 0.036 (6.25)0.15 ± 0.00 (14.4)R233A0.222 ± 0.018 (10.8)0.25 ± 0.03 (18.7)Mutants with reduced inhibition by ATIII in the presence of heparin onlyR89A/R93A/E94A1.06 ± 0.05 (2.26)0.10 ± 0.03 (21.6)R98A2.32 ± 0.22 (1.03)0.11 ± 0.05 (19.6)R245A2.85 ± 0.26 (0.84)0.28 ± 0.03 (7.71)K248A2.28 ± 0.18 (1.05)<0.05 (>43)K252A/D255A/Q256A3.36 ± 0.29 (0.71)0.06 ± 0.06 (36.0)2-a Heparin was used at 0.2 unit/ml.2-b The values in parenthesis represent the fold decrease in rate relative to wild-type thrombin. Open table in a new tab The k 2 for mutants R89A/R93A/E94A, R98A, R245A, K248A, and K252A/D255A/Q256A was similar to that of the wild-type for heparin-independent ATIII inhibition but was decreased by 7.7–43-fold for heparin-dependent ATIII inhibition. These mutants were most probably weakened in their interactions with heparin. Heparin acceleration of ATIII inhibition of mutant K248A was unmeasureable at 0.2 unit/ml heparin. However, heparin-dependent inhibition of K248A by ATIII was detectable when the concentration of heparin was increased by 5-fold (1.0 units/ml) although reduced 14.6-fold relative to wild-type thrombin at the same increased concentration of heparin (data not shown). Three thrombin mutants (E25A, R178A/R180A/D183A, and E202A) which displayed increased sensitivity to heparin-dependent ATIII inhibition were also further analyzed in a time course assay for inhibition with ATIII alone. The second-order rate constant of inhibition,k 2, were reported in Table III. Whether in the absence or presence of heparin, the increase ink 2 was 1.5–2.2-fold, suggesting that these mutations probably enhanced the interaction of thrombin with ATIII.Table IIIThrombin mutants with enhanced sensitivity to inhibition by antithrombin IIIMutationk 2 × 10−5(ATIII)k 2 × 10−8 (ATIII + heparin)3-aHeparin was used at 0.2 unit/ml.m −1·min −1Wild-type2.40 ± 0.10 (1.00)3-bThe values in parentheses represent the fold increase in rate relative to wild-type thrombin.2.16 ± 0.08 (1.00)E25A5.15 ± 0.24 (2.15)3.76 ± 0.18 (1.74)R178A/R180A/D183A3.97 ± 0.22 (1.65)3.27 ± 0.36 (1.51)E202A4.39 ± 0.16 (1.82)4.76 ± 0.39 (2.20)3-a Heparin was used at 0.2 unit/ml.3-b The values in parentheses represent the fold increase in rate relative to wild-type thrombin. Open table in a new tab A library of thrombin mutants was screened to probe the structural requirements for the interaction of thrombin with antithrombin III, the most physiologically significant inhibitor of thrombin. The 79 amino acid residues mutated are in the upper quartile of thrombin residues in terms of their exposure to solvent and account for approximately 62% of the total solvent accessible surface area of thrombin. Therefore this study represents a comprehensive analysis because it focuses on the residues most likely to be available for interactions with other macromolecules and benefits from the supposition that the surface residues of proteins are more tolerant to sequence variation (35Bowie J.U. Reidhaar-Olson J.F. Lim W.A. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 247: 1306-1310Google Scholar) and thus their substitution is less likely to cause nonspecific structural perturbations. Mutations that influenced the recognition of ATIII had three distinct phenotypes and the residues substituted in each class were clustered in three distinct spatial locations on the surface of thrombin. Three mutations decreased the susceptibility of thrombin to inhibition by ATIII in both the presence and absence of heparin. The residues substituted in these mutants (Trp50, Glu229, and Arg233) were predicted to be involved in direct interactions with ATIII. These residues were clustered around the active site cleft of thrombin and most likely contact the exposed substrate loop of ATIII (Fig. 2). This interpretation is supported by the observation that the mutation of these residues also significantly decreased the recognition of a small tripeptidyl substrate, S-2238. Notably, there were no residues outside of the active site cleft that were identified as interacting directly with ATIII. This is notable in light of the well known propensity of thrombin to utilize exosite interactions for the recognition of macromolecular substrates and inhibitors including fibrinogen, platelet thrombin receptor, protein C, thrombomodulin, and hirudin (19Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Google Scholar, 20Furie B. Bing D.H. Feldmann R.J. Robison D.J. Burnier J.P. Furie B.C. J. Biol.

Hemostasis. 1993; 19: 321-333Google Scholar). ATIII is a large protein (58 kDa) yet thrombin recognizes it as it recognizes a tripeptidyl substrate, utilizing the active site cleft alone to interact with the exposed substrate loop. In previous studies, deletions of three residues in the two loops that define the active site cleft of thrombin, Pro48-Trp50 (22Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R. MacGillivray R.T.A. Stone S.R. Esmon C.T.

Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19341-19348Google Scholar) decreased the rate of association with ATIII by 100- and 350-fold, respectively. These deletions also had large effects on the hydrolysis of peptidyl and other substrates suggesting the possibility that some proportion of their effects may be attributable to nonspecific structural perturbations caused by the introduction of a relatively unwieldy mutation in close proximity to the active site. Subsequent substitution of Trp50 with alanine decreased the on-rate of ATIII by 13-fold in the absence of heparin and 7-fold in the presence of heparin (25Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1918-1924Google Scholar) and single substitutions of Trp148 and Lys154 in the Leu144-Gly155 loop had insignificant effects on the recognition of ATIII (24Bouton M.-C. Plantier J.-L. Dembak M. Guillin M.-C. Rabiet M.-J. Jandrot-Perrus M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 526-532Google Scholar), which is in close agreement with this study. The substrate specificity of thrombin has been shown to respond allosterically to Na+ binding (37Dang Q.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Google Scholar) and the Na+free form is less sensitive to inhibition by ATIII both in the presence and absence of heparin (38Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22089-22092Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography revealed that the Na+ ion is coordinated by the carbonyl oxygens of Tyr190, Arg233, and Lys236 and mutation of Arg233 and Lys236 and flanking residues Asp232, Asp234, and Tyr237(33Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Google Scholar, 38Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22089-22092Google Scholar) decreased the response to Na+ and decreased sensitivity to inhibition by ATIII. Therefore the effects of substituting Arg233 and Glu229 (which is salt-bridged to Lys236) on inhibition by ATIII observed in our study may be partially mediated through undefined conformational changes that result from perturbing Na+ binding. Alternatively, the effects of Na+ binding may be mediated by perturbing the conformation of the side chains of Glu229and Arg233 which may be in direct contact with ATIII. The second class of mutations was composed of those that displayed resistance to inhibition by ATIII in the presence of heparin but not in the absence of heparin. The residues substituted in these mutants (Arg89, Arg93, Glu94, Arg98, Arg245, Lys248, Lys252, Asp255, Glu256) are candidates for those involved in direct interactions with heparin. These residues are clustered on a surface of thrombin perpendicular to the face containing the active site cleft (Fig. 2). Many of these residues are included in the cluster of basic amino acids that is referred to as thrombin exosite II (19Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Google Scholar). Previous studies (26Church F.C. Pratt C.W. Noyes C.M. Kalayanamit T. Sherrill G.B. Tobin R.B. Meade J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18419-18425Google Scholar, 29Ye J. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17965-17970Google Scholar) have implicated several of these residues (Arg89, Arg93, Arg98, Arg245, Lys248, Lys252) in the recognition of heparin, including two studies (27Sheehan J.P. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5518-5522Google Scholar, 28Gan Z.-R. Li Y. Chen Z. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1301-1305Google Scholar) where positively charged amino acids in exosite II were substituted with negatively-charged glutamic acid. Because some of the effects of these non-conservative mutations may be due to the detrimental effects of introducing a residue of opposite charge, the observation of similar defects following replacement with the small neutral amino acid alanine in our study confirms the likely role of these residues in electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged glycosaminoglycan. Several additional basic residues (Arg123, Arg170, Lys174, Arg178, Arg180) have been included in the structural definition of exosite II (19Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Google Scholar) due to their spatial proximity to the residues listed above. Lys174 was protected from chemical modification by heparin (26Church F.C. Pratt C.W. Noyes C.M. Kalayanamit T. Sherrill G.B. Tobin R.B. Meade J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18419-18425Google Scholar) and non-conservative substitution of Arg180 with glutamic acid decreased the efficiency of heparin catalyzed inhibition by ATIII (28Gan Z.-R. Li Y. Chen Z. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1301-1305Google Scholar). However, none of these residues were implicated in the recognition of heparin following substitution with alanine (Fig. 1). The third class of mutations was composed of those that displayed slightly enhanced sensitivity to inhibition by ATIII both in the presence and absence of heparin (Table III). The residues substituted in these mutants (Glu25, Arg178, Arg180, Asp183, Glu202) may be involved in unfavorable interactions with ATIII perhaps through steric hindrance and the substitution of these residues may enhance the binding energy of the thrombin-ATIII complex. Consistent with our study, the substitution of Glu202 with glutamine was previously shown to increase by 1.5-fold the second-order rate constant for inhibition by ATIII (39Le Bonniec B.F. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7371-7375Google Scholar) and the mutant thrombin was proposed to exhibit a preference for substrates, such as ATIII, with glycine at position P2. Inhibition by ATIII is the primary mechanism for the clearance of active thrombin in vivo (11Liu L. Dewar L. Song Y. Kulczycky M. Blajchman M.A. Fenton J.W., II Andrew M. Delorme M. Ginsberg J. Preissner K.T. Ofosu F.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 405-412Google Scholar) and we have previously shown that mutations in thrombin that confer resistance to ATIII in vitro may correlate with a prolonged half-life in plasma and decreased clearance rate in vivo (31Gibbs C.S. Coutré S.E. Tsiang M. Li W.-X. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E. Law V.S. Mao C.T. Matsumura S.Y. Mejza S.J. Paborsky L.R. Leung L.L.K. Nature. 1995; 378: 413-416Google Scholar, 32Tsiang M. Paborsky L.R. Li W.-X.

By analogy with naturally occurring mutations in ATIII (10Broze Jr G.J. Tollefsen D.M. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A.W. Majerus P.W. Varmus H. The Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1994: 629-656Google Scholar, 12Perry D.J. Carrell R.W. Hum. Mutat. 1996; 7: 7-22Google Scholar), mutations in thrombin that modulate inhibition by ATIII, such as those described in this study, may predispose individuals to an increased risk of thrombosis. Mutations involving residues in the heparin-binding site (R89A/R93A/E94A, R89A, R245A, K248A, K252A/D255A/Q256A) that are resistant to glycosaminoglycan-catalyzed inhibition by ATIII yet retain activity toward peptidyl substrates (Table I) and substrates in vivo (34Tsiang M. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E. Rojas M.E. Leung L.L.K. Gibbs C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16854-16863Google Scholar) are functionally equivalent to type IIc mutations in ATIII (mutations in the heparin-binding site of ATIII) (10Broze Jr G.J. Tollefsen D.M. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A.W. Majerus P.W. Varmus H. The Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1994: 629-656Google Scholar). Individuals possessing such mutations may be prone to thromboembolic disease. In contrast, the mutations identified in this study involving residues that are implicated in direct interactions with ATIII (Trp50, Glu229, Arg233) would not be expected to be prothrombotic. Because of their proximity to the active site, the mutation of these residues also modulates the recognition of other substrates and alters the specificity of thrombin to favor the anticoagulant substrate protein C (31Gibbs C.S. Coutré S.E. Tsiang M. Li W.-X. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E. Law V.S. Mao C.T. Matsumura S.Y. Mejza S.J. Paborsky L.R. Leung L.L.K. Nature. 1995; 378: 413-416Google Scholar, 32Tsiang M. Paborsky L.R. Li W.-X.

Thus naturally occurring mutations in this class may have a net anticoagulant effect and may be protective of thrombosis. We thank Drs. Lisa R. Paborsky, Mark D. Matteucci, and Larry L. K.

The possibility that the endothelium, through these or other mediators, may control the activation of TNF-producing cells in blood has not been addressed directly. The first objective of this study was to examine whether endothelial cells can influence the production of TNF from monocytes. For comparative purposes, elastase release was also measured as a marker of neutrophil activation in the same whole blood system. The second objective was to identify the mediators of such effects. In this report we describe the purification of an active species from the conditioned media of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and its unexpected identification as calmodulin. Furthermore, we provide preliminary evidence that there are cell-surface receptors for calmodulin on myeloid cells. The results imply that calmodulin released from endothelial cells serves the function of an extracellular signaling molecule, which regulates the activation of inflammatory cells. Monoclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant human TNF-α (a generous gift of Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) and a complex of human neutrophil elastase and human α1-antitrypsin (Athens Research and Technology, Athens, GA) by standard techniques. (15Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. LeBonniec B.F. Johnson A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 359-385Google Scholar) Polyclonal antibody to TNF was raised in a goat. TNF was assayed in plasma diluted 1:10 using mAb TNF1286 for capture and the goat polyclonal for detection or with mAb TNF1311 for capture and TNF1289 for detection. The lower limit of sensitivity for this assay was ∼0.5 ng/ml. Elastase-α1-antitrypsin complexes were assayed in plasma diluted 1:50 using anti-elastase mAb HEL1076 for capture and anti-antitrypsin mAb HAT1099 for detection. Antibodies used for detection were biotinylated using NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce), and streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase and an amplified substrate system (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used for readout. HUVEC were cultured in medium 199 (Mediatech) containing 15% v/v heat-inactivated bovine calf serum, 0.5% v/v endothelial cell growth supplement (prepared as described by Maciag et al. (16Maciag T. Cerundolo J. Ilsley S. Kelley P.R. Forand R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5674-5678Google Scholar)), 10 μg/ml heparin (Sigma), 2 mml-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Mediatech) as described (17Moore K.L. Andreoli S.P. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Bang N.U. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 124-130Google Scholar, 18Carson C.W. Hunder G.G. Kaplan K.L. Johnson C.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 139: 199-200Google Scholar) and used at first through fourth passage. For the production of conditioned media, 2 m2 of endothelial cells were grown to confluence in cell culture factories (Nunc, Denmark). After washing with Hanks' balanced salt solution without phenol red (HBSS composition (in mm): CaCl2, 1.26; KCl, 5.36; KH2PO4, 0.44; MgCl2, 0.49; NaCl, 136.9; NaHCO3, 4.17; Na2HPO4, 3.38; glucose, 5.56) (Life Technologies, Inc.), they were incubated in 1.5 liters of modified Eagle's medium without phenol red (Mediatech) with the calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma) at 3 × 10−6m. After 4 h the conditioned media were collected and the cells placed in an additional 2.5 liters of medium without ionophore overnight. The conditioned media were pooled and concentrated to 150 ml by ultrafiltration with a 3,000 molecular weight cut-off membrane cartridge (S1Y3, Amicon, Beverly, MA). 24-Well culture plates (Costar) were coated with 2% w/v gelatin (Sigma). For experiments involving endothelial cell monolayers, HUVEC were seeded onto gelatin-coated wells at 3–5 × 105 cells per well 48 h prior to experimentation. All wells were washed with HBSS. Blood from healthy volunteers was drawn within 5 min of use into heparin (10 units/ml final; UpJohn, Kalamazoo, MI) or, where specified, hirudin (10 units/ml; Sigma) and 200 μl added per well. To minimize evaporation, only the center eight wells were used, and the outer wells were filled with sterile HBSS. Test reagents dissolved in HBSS (8–10 μl) were added to the wells immediately after the blood; calmodulin was diluted in HBSS supplemented with 0.1% sterile pyrogen-free gelatin (Sigma), which served as its buffer control. In most experiments, LPS (from Escherichia coli strain O55:B5, Difco) was used to stimulate TNF release. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in room air, 5% CO2 on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm, for 4 h unless otherwise noted. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min and assayed for TNF and elastase. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and neutrophils were prepared from freshly drawn heparinized blood by density gradient separation on Mono-Poly Resolving Medium (Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA) (19Furmaniak-Kazmierczak E. Hu C.Y. Esmon C.T. Blood. 1993; 81: 405-411Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 (Mediatech) and resuspended at a concentration of 2.5–9 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 plus 10% autologous heparinized plasma or in 100% plasma. 200-μl aliquots were added to 24-well tissue culture plates, incubated, and assayed as described for whole blood. The human monocytic and myelomonocytic cell lines, THP-1, HL-60, MonoMac-6, and U937 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2 mml-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Mediatech). Cells were washed, resuspended, and used as described for PBMC. To guide the purification of an active factor, chromatographic fractions of HUVEC-conditioned media were assayed for the ability to inhibit LPS-induced TNF release by their addition in a 0.1 volume to the whole blood just prior to stimulation with LPS. In some cases, the fractions were first desalted into TBS on a PD-10 gel filtration column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Active fractions were subjected to further isolation procedures until an essentially pure protein (as judged by SDS-PAGE) was obtained. The purification will be described in brief since the active fraction was shown to be calmodulin. The irrelevant proteins were precipitated from the concentrated conditioned media by acidification to pH 5 and addition of 12% polyethylene glycol followed by ultracentrifugation. The supernatant was separated by anion exchange (Mono Q HR10/10, Pharmacia), gel filtration (1.5 × 100 cm Sephacryl S-100HR, Pharmacia), and chromatofocusing (Mono P HR 5/20, Pharmacia). To further concentrate the material purified as above, and to remove the chromatofocusing buffer (Polybuffer, Pharmacia) to prepare the specimen for sequencing, the active fractions were applied to a reverse-phase microbore HPLC column (PLRP-S, 1 × 50 mm, Michrom BioResources, Pleasanton, CA) and eluted with acetonitrile, yielding a single major peak. Samples to be evaluated for calcium-dependent binding to phenyl groups were loaded onto a phenyl-Superose column (HR 5/5, Pharmacia) and washed with 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then with 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The column was eluted with 1 mm EDTA, 0.02m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. To determine heat stability, the purified endothelial factor and calmodulin samples were heated to 90 °C for 5 min, immediately chilled on ice, and then assayed for activity. Peak fractions from the HPLC were partially evaporated in a SpeedVac (Savant Instruments Inc., Farmingdale, NY) to remove acetonitrile. Approximately 15 μg of material was subjected to enzymatic digestion with trypsin according to the method of Stoneet al. (20Stone K.L. Lo Presti M.B. Crawford J.M. De Angelis R. Williams K.R. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1993Google Scholar). The tryptic fragments were separated by HPLC on a 1 × 50 mm microbore C18 column (Michrom BioResources) and eluted using a linear gradient of acetonitrile to 50%. The eluate from the column was monitored by absorption at 215 nm and by in-line mass spectrometry (AP III LC/MS/MS system, Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). Amino acid sequence analyses were performed using automated Edman degradation with a model 470A gas-phase protein sequencer equipped with a model 120A on-line phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) (21Hewick R.M. Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Dreyer W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7990-7997Google Scholar). Protein samples and chromatography fractions were analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE gels according to the method of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Gels were stained with a Bio-Rad silver stain kit (Bio-Rad). Calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase was used to assay calmodulin function as described by Wallace et al. (23Wallace R.W. Tallant E.A. Cheung W.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 39-47Google Scholar). Calmodulin was also measured by a radioimmunoassay kit (Calmodulin RIAgents, Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the supplied unheated calmodulin preparation for the standard. Samples and supplied standard were heated at 90 °C for 1 h to enhance reactivity with the antibodies. Bovine testis calmodulin was prepared according to the method of Dedman and Kaetzel (24Dedman J.R. Kaetzel M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 1-8Google Scholar). Protein concentration of purified calmodulin samples was estimated, using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 0.18 ml mg−1 cm−1 (25Watterson D.M. Harrelson Jr., W.G. Keller P.M. Sharief F. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4501-4513Google Scholar). Calmodulin derived from human erythrocytes (Sigma) or hog brain (Boehringer Mannheim) was also obtained and used in some experiments. It should be noted that the peptide sequences of the calmodulins of these species are identical. Recombinant calmodulin was prepared and expressed in E. coliby inserting the human calmodulin I gene into the pIN-III-pelB-Neo vector, a modification of the pIN-III-pelB plasmid (26Rezaie A. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Google Scholar) which includes a tandemneo r gene. The construct contains an N-terminal extension, EFEDQVDPRLIDGKIEGR, corresponding to the epitope for monoclonal antibody HPC-4 (27Stearns D.J. Kurosawa S. Sims P.J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 826-832Google Scholar). Otherwise, the recombinant protein differs from mammalian calmodulin only in that it is expected to lack the post-translational trimethylation of lysine 115. The protein was isolated from periplasmic extracts by calcium-dependent affinity chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose followed by HPC-4 affinity chromatography (26Rezaie A. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Google Scholar). Bovine testis calmodulin was radiolabeled with iodine-125 using Enzymobeads (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Free iodine and any denatured calmodulin were removed by calcium-dependent affinity purification on a 1-ml stop-flow phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02m MOPS, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5. After washing with 5 ml of the same buffer, the 125I-calmodulin was eluted with 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 m MOPS, 1 mm EDTA. Unless otherwise specified, cell binding studies were done with all steps, including washing of the cells, performed at 4 °C. Cells were washed once in HBSS without Ca2+ or Mg2+containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, supplemented with 1% human serum albumin and 1 mm EDTA (HHA/EDTA), and twice in HBSS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, and 1% albumin (HHA/Ca2+). The cells were then resuspended in HHA/Ca2+ at a concentration of 1.25 × 108 cells/ml. 80 μl (1 × 107 cells) were aliquoted into 1.5 ml of siliconized Eppendorf tubes (PGC Scientific, Gaithersburg, MD) and 10 μl of HHA/Ca2+ with varying concentrations of unlabeled calmodulin (from 10−9 to 2 × 10−5m final) added. Immediately thereafter, 10 μl of125I-calmodulin was added to a final concentration of 5 × 10−9m and allowed to incubate for 40 min at 4 °C with intermittent mixing. After the incubation period the cells were carefully layered over 9:1 dibutyl phthalate:apiezon oil (J. T. Baker Inc. and Apiezon Products Ltd., London, UK) and centrifuged at 200 × g for 2 min in siliconized 400-μl centrifuge tubes. The tip of the centrifuge tube containing the cell pellet was amputated and counted in a gamma counter (Iso-Data, Rolling Meadows, IL) for the determination of bound125I-calmodulin. To determine nonspecific binding, 10 μl HHA/EDTA containing 20 mm EDTA (2 mm final) was added instead of unlabeled calmodulin. Nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 2 × 10−5m cold calmodulin gave similar values. The Ligand computer software program (Elsevier-BIOSOFT, Cambridge, UK) was used to estimate theK d and the number of binding sites per cell. To show whether bound calmodulin was internalized, binding studies were performed at 4 and 37 °C, as described above except that after the incubation period was complete, the cells were washed in HHA/EDTA and resuspended in HHA/EDTA before layering over dibutyl phthalate/apiezon oil. To determine if calmodulin-binding sites were sensitive to proteolytic digestion, HL-60 cells were washed once in HBSS with 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA, without albumin (HH/EDTA) and twice with HH/Ca2+ and resuspended in HH/Ca2+at 107 cells per ml. l-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) was then added to a final 41 units/ml and allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. The trypsin was then neutralized by the addition of diisopropyl fluorophosphate to 2 mm final. The cells were then washed once in HH/Ca2+ and resuspended in HHA/Ca2+and binding studies performed as described. Cells were washed once in HH/EDTA, twice in HH/Ca2+, and then resuspended in HH/Ca2+ at a concentration of 1.25 × 107 cells/ml. 800 μl were aliquoted into 1.5-ml siliconized Eppendorf tubes (PGC Scientific) and 100 μl of HH/Ca2+ or HH/EDTA with 20 mm EDTA (2 mm final) added. Radiolabeled calmodulin in 100 μl of HH/Ca2+ was then added to a final concentration of 10−7m and allowed to bind for 40 min. The cross-linking reagent, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce), dissolved in Me2SO was then added in a final concentration of 1 mm, and cross-linking was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 4 °C. The unbound and uncross-linked125I-calmodulin was then removed by washing twice in HH/EDTA, and the cell pellet was extracted in buffer consisting of 0.15m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm pepstatin, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 0.02% sodium azide overnight at 4 °C with rocking. The next morning the Triton-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The supernatant, containing the solubilized membrane proteins, was added to Laemmli sample buffer, electrophoresed, dried, and autoradiagraphed on X-OMAT AR film (Kodak). Statistical comparisons were by pairedt test. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Incubation of whole blood with LPS for 4 h evoked a dose-dependent release of TNF (Fig. 1). In control wells not treated with LPS, TNF levels were usually below the limit of detection by our ELISA. When blood treated with LPS was incubated over an endothelial monolayer for 4 h, TNF release was reduced by about half at all concentrations of LPS (Fig. 1). Donors varied in the extent of inhibition by endothelial cells, and in 8 of 70 total experiments, no inhibition of TNF release was observed. In contrast to the effect on TNF, blood incubated over a HUVEC monolayer exhibited increased elastase release at all concentrations of LPS (Fig. 2). In some subjects (8 of 35 total experiments), elastase release was not augmented by endothelium; five subjects appeared to show inhibition. One contribution to these cellular responses might be the release of active peptides from the endothelium. To test this possibility, conditioned media from endothelial cells were assayed for TNF inhibiting activity. After concentrating 66-fold by ultrafiltration, conditioned media (collected without A23187 stimulation) were able to inhibit TNF release by 43% (n = 2). Empirically, it was observed that stimulation of the endothelial cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 yielded increased inhibitory activity in the conditioned media, and therefore, purification was attempted from ionophore conditioned media. The purification was performed as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” At each chromatographic step a single peak of activity was identified. The activity eluted from a Mono Q anion exchange column at 0.35 m NaCl at pH 7.5. The isoelectric point predicted by chromatofocusing was pH 3.4. After chromatofocusing, the sample was essentially pure as judged by 12% SDS-PAGE. Silver staining demonstrated a single negative staining (ghost) band with an apparent mass of ∼21 kDa (Fig.3). No N-terminal sequence was generated from the purified protein, suggesting that the N terminus was blocked. To obtain internal sequence information, a trypsin digest was performed and the resulting fragments separated by HPLC. The eluted fragments were analyzed in-line with electro-spray mass spectrometry. Sequence was obtained from two fractions; one (eluate peak 3) contained clearly distinguishable major (VFDKDGNGYISAAELR) and minor (MKDTDSEEEIREAFR) sequences, and the other (eluate peak 4) contained a faint sequence (XXMTNLXEXLTDXXXDXXXX). In total 40 amino acid residues were identified in the three fragments. This sequence information was compared with known sequences in the Swiss-Prot data base using the GCG software package (Version 7; Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI), which revealed complete identity with three contiguous sequences of calmodulin, corresponding to amino acids 76–126. The sequences of the three fragments and their measured masses (as well as the masses of the other HPLC eluate peaks, which were not sequenced) corresponded to known tryptic fragments of calmodulin (28Vanaman T.C. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 296-310Google Scholar, 29Walsh M. Stevens F.C. Kuznicki J. Drabikowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7440-7443Google Scholar, 30Watterson D.M. Sharief F. Vanaman T.C. J.

Both species of calmodulin had a similar spectral pattern. The value obtained for the endothelial factor (16,785.77 ± 1.75 daltons) agrees well with the predicted molecular mass of calmodulin of 16,790 daltons (16,706 as calculated by the GCG software for the amino acid sequence, plus 84 daltons for the known trimethylation of lysine 115 and the acetylation of the N terminus) and with the value obtained for hog brain calmodulin (16,788.65 ± 1.11 daltons). Calmodulin was obtained from human erythrocytes, hog brain, and bovine testes, and recombinant epitope-tagged calmodulin was expressed inE. coli. Each of these calmodulins demonstrated inhibition of TNF production in the whole blood assay system (Fig.4). Maximum inhibition was observed at 1 × 10−7m and the half-maximal effect occurred at approximately 3 × 10−8m (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). Calmodulin and the material purified from endothelial cell-conditioned media, like HUVEC monolayers, also augmented elastase release from whole blood (Fig. 5). The concentration of calmodulin evoking half-maximal augmentation of elastase was similar to that required for inhibition of TNF release.Figure 5TNF and elastase release by whole blood in response to 100 ng/ml LPS and varying concentrations of authentic calmodulin (top) or the purified active material from HUVEC-conditioned media (peak fraction from the Mono P chromatofocusing column, bottom). Responses of two donors are shown;error bars are range of duplicate blood samples. The abscissa of each plot represents the final concentration in the incubation mixture. Buffer indicates the response to LPS with the addition only of sterile Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% pyrogen-free gelatin (the dilution vehicle for calmodulin).Polybuffer indicates the response to LPS with the addition of the column elution buffer (Polybuffer 74, pH 2.9) that had first been neutralized by the addition of 0.1 volume of 200 mmHEPES, pH 7.5. The Mono P fraction was likewise neutralized with 0.1 volume of 200 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and serial dilutions made in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% gelatin. By reference to the authentic calmodulin curves, the concentration of calmodulin in the undiluted Mono P fraction was estimated to be 8 × 10−6m or 134 μg/ml. α1-AT, α1-antitrypsin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The responses to calmodulin were more consistent than the responses to the HUVEC monolayers, although individual variability was still evident. Failure to inhibit TNF release with 10−7m calmodulin was seen in only 3 of 62 total experiments, and failure to augment elastase release was seen in 12 of 56 total experiments, with just one of the 56 demonstrating inhibition of elastase release by >20%. The amount of calmodulin present in the active fraction from the Mono P column was estimated by comparing the activity of authentic hog brain calmodulin with dilutions of the active chromatographic fraction. The resulting estimate, 134 μg/ml, agreed well with a functional phosphodiesterase assay, which yielded an estimate of 128 μg/ml. On SDS-PAGE gels, the purified endothelial factor co-migrated with authentic calmodulin and demonstrated the same negative staining with silver. It also demonstrated the same shift in mobility when electrophoresis was performed in the presence of calcium as compared with EDTA (not shown), which occurs because calmodulin retains the ability to bind calcium and undergo conformational change in the presence of SDS (31Wallace R.W. Tallant E.A. Cheung W.Y. Cheung W.Y. Calcium and Cell Function. Academic Press, New York1980: 13-40Google Scholar, 32Klee C.B. Crouch T.H. Krinks M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6270-6273Google Scholar). The binding of Ca2+ to calmodulin induces the exposure of a hydrophobic patch at either end of the molecule allowing calcium-dependent binding to media such as phenyl-Sepharose (33Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Google Scholar). TNF-inhibiting activity was selectively removed from the purified endothelial factor preparation by passage over a phenyl-Superose column in the presence of calcium, and TNF-inhibiting activity could subsequently be eluted from this column by EDTA (data not shown). Another unusual property of calmodulin is its resistance to thermal denaturation. Neither authentic calmodulin nor the purified endothelial cell factor was inactivated by heat treatment (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that calmodulin may act by accelerating the degradation of TNF in blood or by interfering with the ELISA for TNF, rather than by inhibiting TNF release from monocytes, experiments were performed in which blood samples were spiked with exogenous recombinant human TNF-α (9 or 36 ng/ml final) with or without authentic calmodulin (10−7m final), and the recovery, as a percentage of the added concentration, was determined by the ELISA. After 10 min incubation at 37 °C, the recovery averaged 87.1 ± 4.1% in control and 82.3 ± 4.0% in calmodu"

Type II mRNA is the most abundant in kidney. We have developed a cell line with features of renal proximal tubular cells which expresses GGT mRNA types with a pattern similar to that of mouse kidney. Because a 346-bp sequence from the type II promoter directed the highest level of CAT activity in these cells, this region was used to drive the expression of a β-galactosidase reporter gene in transgenic mice. Two transgenic mouse lines expressed β-galactosidase limited to the renal proximal tubules. Site-directed deletions within this 346-bp promoter region demonstrated that cis-elements containing the consensus binding sites for AP2, a glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-like element, and the initiator region were required for transcriptional activity and were not additive. Purified AP2 bound and footprinted the AP2 consensus region, making it likely that transcription from the GGT type II promoter is regulated in part by AP2. These data suggest that transcription of the type II promoter requires multiple protein DNA interactions involving at least an AP2 element, and probably a GRE-like element and the initiator region.

Shi Z.-Z. Wan D.-F. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1175-1185Google Scholar). In kidney GGT expression is restricted to proximal tubules, where the γ-glutamyl cycle plays an important role in the recycling of GSH (1Vina J. Glutathione: Metabolism and Physiologic Functions.

GGT activity in proximal tubules results in reabsorption of greater than 99.9% of the tubular glutathione (as the constituent amino acids) and thus functions in cysteine reabsorption (1Vina J.

We have previously identified and characterized the structure of six different GGT mRNAs in mouse kidney (5Rajagopalan S.R. Wan D.-F. Habib G.M. Sepulveda A.R. McLeod M.R. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6179-6183Google Scholar). The GGT mRNA species differ in their 5′-untranslated sequences but share a common coding region (5Rajagopalan S.R. Wan D.-F. Habib G.M. Sepulveda A.R. McLeod M.R. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6179-6183Google Scholar, 6Shi Z.-Z. Carter B.Z., M., H.G. He X. Sazer S. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 215-224Google Scholar). The different GGT mRNAs are expressed from separate promoters that are present in the 10-kb 5′-flanking region of the GGT gene (7Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10699-10705Google Scholar). We have studied the relative abundance of the GGT mRNAs in kidney and found that type II mRNA is the most abundant, representing approximately 45% of the total, while the five remaining GGT mRNAs are present at lower levels (7Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10699-10705Google Scholar). Different GGT RNAs are expressed in a tissue restricted-pattern, and in general one type is present in only a few different tissues (3Lieberman M.W. Barrios R. Carter B.C. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Rajagopalan S. Sepulveda A.R. Shi Z.-Z. Wan D.-F. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1175-1185Google Scholar). For example, type III is expressed only in fetal liver and type IV is also detected in epididymis and in embryonic cells derived from the endoderm of the yolk sac (3Lieberman M.W. Barrios R. Carter B.C. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Rajagopalan S. Sepulveda A.R. Shi Z.-Z. Wan D.-F. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1175-1185Google Scholar, 8Sepulveda A.R. Habib G.M. Damjanov A. Matacic S. Damjanov I. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 494-498Google Scholar). Although GGT is expressed in a relatively ubiquitous manner, the restricted pattern of expression of individual GGT mRNAs has led to the hypothesis that the different promoters are tissue-restricted. In contrast to other GGT mRNAs, significant expression of type II is limited to the kidney where it is also the most abundant GGT mRNA (7Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10699-10705Google Scholar). Our previous studies also demonstrated that the type II GGT promoter conferred significantly higher levels of CAT activity in transient transfections in mouse proximal tubular cells than in fibroblasts, indicating that those cis-acting elements were sufficient to direct the expression of the reporter gene in a cell specific manner (7Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10699-10705Google Scholar). We therefore examined the type II promoter to determine if it contains sufficient cis-acting elements to direct kidney restricted expression of a β-galactosidase reporter gene in vivo by generating transgenic mice. In addition we have performed deletion analyses of the 346-bp type II promoter to determine the cis-acting binding sequences that are responsible for transcriptional activity in mouse proximal tubular (MPT) cells. We obtained a series of 5′ truncations and short sequence deletions by site-directed mutagenesis and tested them by transient transfection assays of the CAT reporter gene. Selected sequences containing critical elements required for promoter activity were tested for their ability to activate a minimal GGT promoter region and heterologous minimal promoters. The ras-transformed MPT cell line was established from the kidneys of p21ras-transgenic mice line 499 (9Schaffner D.L. Barrios R. Massey C. Banez E.I. Ou C. Rajagopalan S. Lebovitz R.M.

The culture medium contained a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10 mm Hepes buffer, sodium bicarbonate at 1.1 mg/ml, 10 nmNa2SeO35H2O (SFFD) and was supplemented with insulin (5 mg/ml), PGE1 (25 ng/ml), triiodothyronine (5 × 10−11m), hydrocortisone (5 × 10−8m), and transferrin (5 mg/ml) (10Taub M. Sato G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1980; 105: 369-378Google Scholar). Whole kidneys were minced and suspended in 1 mg/ml collagenase in SFFD. Cells were harvested and plated in 25-mm plates. The cells were maintained as mixed cell cultures in medium supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum and passed every 3–4 days. The antisense RNA probes used for the quantification of the GGT mRNAs II and IV were obtained by in vitrotranscription of the GGT cDNAs previously reported (5Rajagopalan S.R. Wan D.-F. Habib G.M. Sepulveda A.R. McLeod M.R. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6179-6183Google Scholar), and their structures are represented in Fig. 1 A. The lengths of their unique 5′ sequences are 94 and 99 bp for probes II and IV, respectively. The β-galactosidase ribonuclease probe was obtained from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). The plasmids were linearized and then transcribed with either T3 or T7 polymerase (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP to obtain the uniformly labeled antisense strand. Total RNA was isolated from the organs of transgenic mice using the acid-phenol guanidine procedure (11Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was obtained from MPT cells and adult Friend leukemia virus strain B mice (FVB) kidneys and selected by oligo(dT)-cellulose type III (Collaborative Research Inc., Bedford, MA). Ribonuclease protection assays were performed with the RPA II ribonuclease protection kit (Ambion, Inc.). Briefly, poly(A)+ RNA from MPT cells or total RNA from FVB or transgenic mouse tissues was hybridized for 18 h at 45 °C with 1 × 105 cpm of a [α-32P]UTP labeled RNA probe. Ribonuclease digestion of the hybridized probe and sample RNA was performed at 30 °C for 30 min, with 0.1 unit of ribonuclease A and 20 units of ribonuclease T1. The protected RNA fragments were separated on 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. For quantitation of GGT mRNA types in MPT cells, the number of counts in each band was determined with the AMBIS Radioanalytic Imaging System and the AMBIS QuantProbe Software version 4.01 (AMBIS, Inc., San Diego, CA). The promoterless plasmid pJFCAT1 (12Fridovich-Keil J.L. Gudas J.M. Bryan I.B. Pardee A.B. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 572-579Google Scholar) was used to subclone the 5′-flanking regions of GGT in front of CAT. PII-2.7 is a 2.7-kb fragment that results fromPstI digestion of the 6.0-kb XhoI clone (7Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10699-10705Google Scholar); thePstI ends were flushed with T4 polymerase, and the fragment was cloned into the XhoI site of pJFCAT1. PII-346 (−346 to +70 bp) and PII-746 (−746 to +70) have been described (7Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10699-10705Google Scholar) and were previously named PII-416 and PII-816, respectively. Since convenient restriction sites were absent in some regions, constructs PII-230 (−230 to +70) and PII-95 (−95 to +70) were obtained by amplifying sequences of appropriate size using PII-346 as a template. The PCR amplifications were performed as described previously (13Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 21-27Google Scholar). PII-230 was obtained by PCR with the oligonucleotides 5′ (5′-CTCGAGAAGGGTTCACCGGTGGCCTCTGC) and 3′ (5′-GCCGCCCTCGAGGCAAGAGGTCAGCTAA), and PII-95 was obtained by PCR with the oligonucleotides 5′ (5′-CTCGAGGTCACAAGCCTGACGCTGCGCC) and 3′ (5′-GCCGCCCTCGAGGCAAGAGGTCAGCTAA). The PCR products were cloned into the pT7Blue vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), digested withXhoI, and subcloned into the XhoI site of pJFCAT1. The 116-bp fragment was obtained by PCR using PII-346 as a template, and using the oligonucleotides 5′ (5′-AAGGATCCGATCTAAGCTATGGTCTAGTG) and 3′ (5′-AAGGATCCAGATCTTCCAGACAGCCCCTGCTAAG), subcloned into the pT7Blue vector, excised with BamHI, and cloned upstream of PII-95 (7Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10699-10705Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotides p6a (5′-GATCACTCGAGCCCCTTAGAGGGAACCAAATCTGGAAAGTGGGGA) and p6b (5′-GATCACTCGAGGGAACCAAATCTGGA) were cloned into theBglII site of the enhancerless CAT reporter vector (pSV40 CAT) (Promega, Madison, WI), to obtain pSV-6a and pSV-6b, respectively. Single copies of each double-stranded oligonucleotide upstream of CAT were obtained after screening by restriction digestion withXhoI and confirmation of the sequence by DNA sequencing. The sense orientations were used. The TATA-Luc minimal promoter reporter containing −58 bp of the cardiac α-actin promoter was kindly provided by R. Schwartz (Baylor College of Medicine) (14Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15628-15633Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide p6a (see above) was cloned upstream of the α-actin minimal promoter into a SacI site in the polylinker of the vector. A construct containing seven copies of the double strand oligonucleotide was used in transient transfection assays. A 416-bp DNA fragment containing 346 bp of the GGT type II promoter region was cloned into the vector PCRTMII (Invitrogen, Inc.) and released after digestion with HindIII and NotI (7Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10699-10705Google Scholar). This probe was end-labeled with a T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP, followed by digestion with BamHI to release the 3′ end of the GGT promoter. Footprint assays were performed with the Core Footprinting System (Promega) using 1 or 2 footprint units of purified human AP2 protein (Promega) and 1 × 105 cpm of labeled probe. The probe was incubated with the protein extract for 10 min, followed by digestion with 0.15 unit of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega). The products were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gels. Gel mobility shift analyses were performed with a double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-ATGGTCTAGTGCCTGGGGTACCCC) containing the AP2 consensus binding site (GCCTGGGG) present at −326 to −319 bp in the GGT type II promoter (7Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10699-10705Google Scholar). Control oligonucleotides included the human metallothionein AP2 binding site (5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT) (58Williams T. Adman A. Lusher B. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Google Scholar); an oligonucleotide containing a mutated human metallothionein AP2 binding site (5′-GATCGAACTGAAATGTAGATGCCCGT); and an oligonucleotide containing the binding site for AP1 (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA) (24Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 × 105 cpm were incubated with 1 μg of purified human AP2 (Promega), using the gel shift assay system (Promega). The products were resolved in 4% nondenaturing acrylamide gels. Quantitation of free and bound probe was performed with the AMBIS Radioanalytic Imaging System and the AMBIS QuantProbe Software version 4.01 (AMBIS, Inc.). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by oligonucleotide in vitro mutagenesis as described by Kunkel, with the Muta-Gene Phagemid In VitroMutagenesis Version 2 (Bio-Rad). The template for mutagenesis was the single-stranded DNA pJFCAT-346 (PII-346), previously described (7Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10699-10705Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were: P1rs (AP2) (5′-GCAATAAAGTAGGGGTAGACGTCTAGACCATAGCTTAGA) or P1 (5′-GCAATAAAGTAGGGGTATAGACCATAGCTTAGA), P2rs (GRE) (5′-TCTGTGAATTTAGAGACGACGTCTAGACCATAGCTTAGA) or P2 (5′-TCTGTGAATTTAGAGACTAGACCATAGCTTAGA), P3 (5′-CTAAGGGGCAGGCCACGCGGCCGCTTCCAGACAGCCCCTGCT), P4 (5′-TTGGTTCCCTCTAAGGGGGCGGCCGCCGGTGAACCCTTCCAGAC), P5 (5′-CTTTCCAGATTTGGTTCCGCGGCCGCCAGAGGCCACCGGTGAACC), P6 (5′-GGCTCCCCCACTTTCCAGGCGGCCGCCTCTAAGGGGCAGAGGC), P7 (5′-ACTAAGAGCCTGGGAAAGCGGCCGCCATTTCCAGATTTGGT), and P8 (INR)(5′-CATCTGAAGGCTTCTGACGTCGAGTCCTCTGTAAGA). The underlined sequences correspond to the AatII (GACGTC) orNotI (GCGGCCGC) restriction sites. The sequences deleted in each construct were PII-P1 and PII-P1rs (−310 to −318), PII-P2 and PII-P2rs (−283 to −273), PII-P3 (−229 to −220), PII-P4 (−219 to −210), PII-P5 (−209 to −200), PII-P6 (−199 to −190), PII-P7 (−179 to −170) and PII-P8 (−9 to +10). Positive clones were screened by digestion with the restriction enzyme specific for the sequence present within the mutated primers, AatII in primers P1rs, P2rs, and P8 and NotI in P3, P4, P5, P6, and P7. The oligonucleotides P1 and P2 have complete deletions of the base pairs (−327 to −320) and (−294 to −284), and do not contain a restriction enzyme recognition site; these clones were screened by sequencing. Sequence analyses of the type II promoter region were performed with the Quest program from Intelligenetics, using the release 6.0 of the Transcription Factors Data Base (15Ghosh D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1749-1756Google Scholar), and with the Transfac data base (16Wingender E. J. Biotechnol. 1994; 35: 273-280Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 106MPT cells in 100-mm plates were transfected using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (17Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Google Scholar). Precipitates contained 20 μg of the GGT-CAT construct and 500 ng of plasmid pCMVβ (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), which expresses β-galactosidase. The β-galactosidase activity was used for correction of the transfection efficiency. Five hours after addition of the DNA to MPT cells a glycerol shock was performed. The cells were harvested and extracts obtained at 48 h post-transfection by freezing and thawing. CAT assays were performed from at least three independent transfections, as described elsewhere (7Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10699-10705Google Scholar). Transfection of luciferase reporter genes was performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) with a DNA/LipofectAMINE ratio of 1/5 (w/v). 0.5 × 106 cells were plated onto 60-mm plates and transfected with a total of 2 μg of DNA. After 48 h of post-transfection, cell extracts were obtained using 200 μl of lysis buffer solution (Promega). Thirty microliters were used to determine luciferase activity using a standard protocol (Promega). To obtain transgenic mice, 346 bp of the GGT type II promoter were cloned upstream of the β-galactosidase reporter gene of the plasmid pNASSβ (CLONTECH). The type II promoter 416-bp fragment containing the 346-bp 5′-flanking region was excised withXhoI from the pT7Blue vector (7Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10699-10705Google Scholar) and subcloned into theXhoI site of the β-galactosidase reporter vector pNASSβ to yield pII-346/β-galactosidase. Clones containing the 416- bp insert were sequenced, and a clone with the sense orientation was selected for microinjection. A 4.3-kb fragment that resulted from digestion of the pII-346/β-galactosidase with EcoRI andHindIII was used for microinjection of fertilized eggs. Injections and implantations were performed using standard protocols (18Hogan B. Constantini F. Lucy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). The transgenes from founder animals and F1 progeny were analyzed by Southern blot of tail DNA. Briefly, 10 μg of genomic DNA were digested withSacI, electrophoresed through a 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to Zeta-Probe (Bio-Rad) nylon membranes. The DNA probe used was the 4.3-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment that was also used for microinjections. Labeling was performed using a random primer labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Hybridization and washing conditions were used as recommended by the Zeta-Probe membrane manufacturer. The oligonucleotides 5′ (5′-GAACTGAAAAACCAGAAAGTTAACT), 3′a (5′-TCCCAGTCACGAGTTGTAAAACGACG), and 3′b (5′-CAATGCCTCCCAGACCGGCAAC) were designed to amplify the transgene across the SV40 introns present in the β-galactosidase reporter vector pNASSβ. RT-PCR was performed with the Access RT-PCR System (Promega). A sample of total RNA extracted from transgenic mouse tissues was first digested with BamHI, which cleaves a site that is present in the intronic region of SV40, to eliminate residual genomic DNAs in the RNA preparations, and was followed by treatment of the sample with 3 units of DNase RQ1 (Promega). One microgram of total RNA was used in each RT-PCR reaction. The integrity of the RNAs was confirmed by amplification of the correct product of G3PDH (CLONTECH). The reaction products were electrophoresed in 2.5% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Mouse tissues were sampled, and 8-μm thick frozen sections were prepared. The tissues were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde for 5 min and stained at 30 °C overnight to 24 h in a solution containing 100 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 3 mmK4Fe(CN)6, and 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Tissue sections were counterstained with neutral red. β-Galactosidase activity in tissues was identified by its ability to convert X-gal into a water-insoluble blue product. To demonstrate GGT in tissue sections histochemistry was performed on frozen sections fixed with methanol (100%) for 5 min and stained as described previously (19Rutenberg A.M. Kim H. Fischbein J.W. Hanker J.S. Wasserkrug H.L. Seligman A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1969; 17: 517-526Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that five separate 5′-flanking regions of the GGT gene have promoter activity in mouse kidney C1.1 cells (7Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10699-10705Google Scholar, 20Wuthrich R.P. Glimcher L.H. Yui M.A. Jevnikar A.M. Dumas S.E. Kelley V.E. Kidney Int. 1990; 37: 783-792Google Scholar). However, ribonuclease protection assays performed to determine the steady state levels of the most abundant GGT mRNA types in kidney (types II and IV) did not show significant expression of these messages in C1.1 cells (Fig. 1 and data not shown). We therefore developed a cell line that would reproduce the pattern of GGT expression in vivo. To establish a mouse proximal tubular cell line, we took advantage of the fact that a line of transgenic mice carrying a rat GGT(I)-ras Val-12 develops proximal tubular hyperplasia (9Schaffner D.L. Barrios R. Massey C. Banez E.I. Ou C. Rajagopalan S. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1051-1060Google Scholar). We were able to establish an MPT cell line from the kidneys of GGT-ras transgenic mice. After 30 passages, the cells maintained a polygonal epithelial morphology, formed cell islands, and, when grown to confluency, formed occasional domes. Histochemical staining for GGT in the MPT cell population was positive and most accentuated in the domes after confluency was reached (data not shown). Northern blot analyses showed that they expressed GGT RNA at a level that is greater than 10% of that present in total kidney RNA (21Habib G.M. Carter B.Z. Sepulveda A.R. Shi Z.-Z. Wan D.-F. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13711-13715Google Scholar). This level is approximately 3-fold higher than the level expressed by C1.1 cells. Since types II and IV are the most abundant GGT mRNA types in kidney, we used ribonuclease protection assays (RPA) to perform a quantitative analysis of these GGT mRNA types in established MPT cells (7Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10699-10705Google Scholar). The structural features of the GGT cDNAs, with a common 3′ segment and a unique 5′-flanking region with a DNA sequence that is type-specific, allows a determination of the relative abundance of each GGT transcript relative to total GGT RNA in a cell population by ribonuclease protection (7Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10699-10705Google Scholar). Using this approach we found that the type II mRNA represents approximately 45% and the type IV approximately 25% of the total GGT mRNA in MPT cells (Fig. 1). These results agree well with those from studies in which we quantified GGT mRNAs in the kidney and found 45% of the GGT mRNA was type II and 33% was type IV (7Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10699-10705Google Scholar). In previous experiments we found that in transient transfection assays of CAT reporter constructs a 346-bp 5′ fragment directed higher CAT activity than a 746-bp promoter region in C1.1 cells (7Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10699-10705Google Scholar). In addition, no significant CAT activity was found in NIH-3T3 cells with these constructs, indicating that cis-elements present in the 346-bp fragment were sufficient for kidney cell specificity. We have evaluated a series of GGT (II) constructs for CAT activity in MPT cells. A construct containing additional 5′-flanking sequences (PII-2.7) (Fig.2) displayed lower level of CAT activity (∼60%) relative to PII-346. Sequential 5′ truncations of the 346-bp region were tested next. Removal of 50 bp (−346 to −296) (PII-296) resulted in a decline in transcription to approximately 30% of PII-346. This 50-bp region contains an AP2 consensus site (GCCTGGGG) (−326 to −319) (22Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Google Scholar) which is a candidate for an activator of GGT transcription (see below). Removal of the 5′ 116 bp of PII-346 (PII-230) results in a reduction in CAT activity to about 25–30% of PII-346. This finding indicates that putative activating cis-elements are present within this 116-bp region. Also, within this region there is an imperfect glucocorticoid receptor consensus binding site (GRE) (GACATCATGTC) (−294 to −284) (23Moore D. Marks A. Buckley D. Kapler G. Payvar F. Goodman H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 699-702Google Scholar). The GRE-like site and the AP2 site do not appear to be additive because deletion of the AP2 site alone (PII-296) results in the same level of activity of PII-230, in which both the AP2 consensus and the GRE-like sequence are removed. Deletion of 249 bp (PII-95) results in a marked decrease in transcription with essentially no activity remaining with this construct (Fig. 2). Within the region deleted in PII-95 there are several consensus binding sites, including putative binding sites for AP1 (TTAGTCACC) (−105 to −97) (24Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Google Scholar), SP1 and AP2 (TCCCCCGCCCA) (−141 to −132) (22Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Google Scholar, 24Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Google Scholar), and cAMP response element binding factor/activating transcription factor (TGACGTCA) (−62 to −55) (25Lin Y. Green M.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 85: 3396-3400Google Scholar) transcription factors. Of the constructs we tested PII-346 has the highest CAT activity in transient transfection assays in MPT cells (Fig. 2). Thus we used this region to construct a fusion reporter gene by cloning it upstream of the bacterial β-galactosidase gene (Fig. 3 A). The pII-346/β-galactosidase construct was transfected into the MPT cell line by transient transfections. Transfected cells stained positively for β-galactosidase (data not shown). The same construct was used to generate transgenic mice by microinjection (see “Experimental Procedures”). Putative transgenic mice were screened by Southern blotting of genomic DNA digested with SacI (Fig. 3 B). The hybridizing probe was the same EcoRI-HindIII fragment that we used for microinjection. Because this probe contains 416 bp of the type II 5′ region, both transgenic and nontransgenic genomic DNAs yield a band of ∼9 kb which corresponds to the endogenous GGT gene. CompleteSacI digestion of the integrated transgene results in a 2.4-kb SacI-SacI fragment which includes the type II 5′ region and part of the β-galactosidase cDNA and a fragment greater than 1.8 kb in length, which includes part of the 3′ end of the β-galactosidase cDNA and a segment of mouse g"
https://openalex.org/W2017663156,"A chimeric growth factor receptor (CSF1R/IR) was constructed by splicing cDNA sequences encoding the extracellular ligand binding domain of the human colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor to sequences encoding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the human insulin receptor. The addition of CSF-1 to cells transfected with the CSF1R/IR chimera cDNA stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein that was immunoprecipitated by an antibody directed against the carboxyl terminus of the insulin receptor. Phosphopeptide maps of the 32P-labeled CSF1R/IR protein revealed the same pattern of phosphorylation observed in32P-labeled insulin receptor β subunits. CSF-1 stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Shc in cells expressing the CSF1R/IR chimera. Lipid accumulation and the expression of a differentiation-specific marker demonstrated that 3T3-L1 preadipocytes undergo CSF-1-dependent differentiation when transfected with the CSF1R/IR chimera cDNA but not when transfected with the expression vector alone. A 12-amino acid deletion within the juxtamembrane region of the CSF1R/IR (CSF1R/IRΔ960) blocked CSF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Shc but did not inhibit CSF-1-mediated differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. These observations indicate that adipocyte differentiation can be initiated by intracellular pathways that do not require tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 or Shc.

These observations indicate that adipocyte differentiation can be initiated by intracellular pathways that do not require tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 or Shc. A primary goal in the study of insulin action is the identification of the intracellular pathways that lead ultimately to changes in the rates of growth, development, and metabolism in primary target tissues of insulin (e.g. adipose, muscle, and liver). One strategy for the study of insulin-sensitive intracellular signaling has been to identify structural features within the insulin receptor that are important components of divergent signal transduction pathways. The goal of this strategy has been to create mutations within specific receptor sequences that result in the selective disruption of some insulin-regulated metabolic pathways while leaving others intact. Deletion mutagenesis of the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain has generated insulin receptors with altered biological properties (1White M.F. Livingston J.N. Backer J.M. Lauris V. Ullrich A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 641-649Google Scholar, 2Maegawa H. McClain D.A. Friedenberg G. Olefsky J.M. Napier M. Lipari T. Dull T.J. Lee J. Ullrich A. J. Biol.

Hara K. Nakafuku M. Okabayashi Y. Kadowaki T. Kaziro Y. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4634-4640Google Scholar). Experiments with these receptor mutants have led to the suggestion that different regions of the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain may play roles in modulating the distinct biological effects of insulin. Most mutations of the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain have removed or altered autophosphorylation sites within the cytoplasmic domain (5Tornqvist H.E. Pierce M.W. Frackelton A.R. Nemenoff R.A. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10212-10219Google Scholar, 6Tornqvist H.E Gunsalus J.R. Nemenoff R.A. Frackelton A.R. Pierce M.W. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11256-11264Google Scholar). This approach has furthered the notion that tyrosine phosphorylation and the tyrosine kinase encoded within the receptor β subunit are essential components of normal insulin action. The majority of structure/function analyses of the insulin receptor, however, have been performed in cells expressing low levels of endogenous insulin receptors, e.g. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CSF, colony-stimulating factor; IR, insulin receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IGF, insulin-like growth factor. or Rat-1 fibroblasts cell lines (reviewed in Ref. 9Tavaré J.M. Siddle K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 1993; 1178: 21-39Google Scholar). Although such cell lines readily express mutated insulin receptors following transfection, they have been less than ideal models for studying the anabolic actions of insulin because they are relatively insensitive to insulin treatment. Although insulin-responsive cell types are excellent systems in which to study insulin action, the fact that they are highly responsive to insulin is an ironic impediment to the mutational analysis of insulin receptor function. Analysis of the ability of mutated insulin receptors to mediate insulin signaling in insulin-responsive cells is confounded by the significant background generated by endogenous insulin receptors. In an attempt to circumvent this concern, we have constructed a chimeric receptor (CSF1R/IR) consisting of the extracellular ligand binding domain of the human CSF-1 receptor (10Coussens L. Van Beveren C. Smith D. Chen E. Mitchell R.L. Isacke C.M. Verma I.M. Ullrich A. Nature. 1986; 320: 277-280Google Scholar) coupled to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the human insulin receptor (11Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzzelli L.M. Dull T.J.

A. 1987; 84: 5237-5241Google Scholar). Chimeric receptors have proven useful for demonstrating that specific receptor structures transduce specific biological responses (14Yan H. Schlessinger J. Chao M.V. Science. 1991; 252: 561-563Google Scholar, 15Reidel H. Dull T.J. Honegger A.M. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2943-2954Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the CSF1R/IR chimera has CSF-1-dependent enzymatic and biological properties expected of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in insulin-responsive cells. The CSF1R/IR permits the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells when nanomolar concentrations of CSF-1 are substituted for insulin in the differentiation protocol. A mutation within the juxtamembrane domain of the CSF1R/IR that inhibits CSF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Shc does not block the ability of CSF-1 to stimulate the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes. Thus, alternative intracellular pathways that do not require tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 or Shc may be used by insulin or IGF I to stimulate differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. CHO K1 cells and CHO cells expressing the wild-type and mutated human insulin receptors were described previously (16Wilden P.A. Kahn C.R. Siddle K. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16660-16668Google Scholar, 17Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. Cahill D.A. Ullrich A. White M.F. J. Biol.

Antibody CT-1 directed against the carboxyl terminus of the human insulin receptor (18Ganderton R.H. Stanley K.K. Field C.E. Coghlan M.P. Soos M.A. Siddle K. Biochem.

Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8302-8311Google Scholar). Anti-Shc and anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. [32P]Orthophosphate was purchased from ICN. [35S]l-Methionine was purchased from Amersham. Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM), penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin antibiotics, G418, fetal bovine serum, restriction endonucleases, and Lipofectamine were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Trypsin treated with tosylphenylalanylchloromethyl ketone was obtained from Worthington Biochemical Corporation. Porcine insulin was from Calbiochem. Dexamethasone and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were from Sigma, and thin-layer chromatography plates were obtained from American Bioanalytical. The mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3 was purchased from Invitrogen. The plasmid pSP72 was from Promega. Human recombinant CSF-1 was a gift from Genetics Institute. The cDNA for the human CSF-1 receptor was a gift from Charles Sherr, Memphis, TN. The CSF-1R/IR chimera was constructed using a PCR strategy. Three PCR primers were designed for construction of the chimeric receptor. chi-1 was an upstream primer that hybridizes to nucleotides 1598–1622 of the human CSF1R (10Coussens L. Van Beveren C. Smith D. Chen E. Mitchell R.L. Isacke C.M. Verma I.M. Ullrich A. Nature. 1986; 320: 277-280Google Scholar). chi-2 was a chimeric oligonucleotide to act as an upstream primer for PCR using the human insulin receptor as template. The first 19 nucleotides of chi-2 included an overhang corresponding to nucleotides 1818–1836 of the human CSF1R. The remainder of chi-2 encoded the initial portion of the insulin receptor transmembrane domain, nucleotides 2903–2927 of the human IR (13Whittaker J.C. Okamoto A.K. Thys R. Bell G.I. Steiner D.F. Hofmann C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5237-5241Google Scholar). chi-3 was a downstream primer corresponding to the complementary strand of base pairs 3028–3055 of the human IR. The first PCR used primers chi-2 and chi-3 and the human IR cDNA as the template to produce the expected product of 172 base pairs. The second PCR used chi-1, the 172-base pair product of the first PCR, and chi-3. The template was the human CSF1R (10Coussens L. Van Beveren C. Smith D. Chen E. Mitchell R.L. Isacke C.M. Verma I.M. Ullrich A. Nature. 1986; 320: 277-280Google Scholar). The expected product was 392 base pairs and generated a DNA sequence with an in-frame attachment of sequences encoding the extracellular domain of the CSF1R to sequences encoding the transmembrane domain and a portion of the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor. Restriction digest of the 392-base pair product from the second PCR with Bsu36 I andBglI yielded a 259-base pair fragment. Prior to restriction digestion, the PCR product was sequenced to confirm the integrity of the expected product. A 1041-base pair HindIII/SalI fragment of the CSF1R was subcloned into pUC18 to create pUC18CSF1041. pUC18CSF1041 was digested with Bsu36 I and SalI, and aBsu36 I/SalI 2081-base pair fragment of the human insulin receptor cDNA was ligated to pUC18CSF1041. The resulting construct, pUC18CSF1041/IR2081, was partially digested withBsu36 I, and a 5083-base pair fragment of pUC18CSF1041 was isolated. The 5083-base pair fragment of pUC18CSF1041 was redigested with BglI, and the 259-base pair Bsu36 I/BglI chimeric PCR product was ligated to produce pUC18CSF1R/IR. pUC18CSF1R/IR was digested with KpnI andBamHI, and a 1966-base pair fragment was isolated. The 3384-base pair CSF1R cDNA (10Coussens L. Van Beveren C. Smith D. Chen E. Mitchell R.L. Isacke C.M. Verma I.M. Ullrich A. Nature. 1986; 320: 277-280Google Scholar) was subcloned intoEcoRI/BamHI cut pSP72 to create pSP72CSF1R. pSP72CSF1R was digested with KpnI and BamHI, and the resulting 4028-base pair fragment was isolated. The 4028-base pairKpnI/BamHI fragment of pSP72CSF1R was ligated to the 1966-base pair KpnI/BamHI fragment isolated from pUC18CSF1R/IR to yield the pSP72CSF1R/IR chimera. The CSF1R/IR chimeric cDNA was isolated by EcoRI and XbaI digestion and subcloned into pcDNA3. For stable expression of the CSF1R/IR in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes, the vector pEF-1 was prepared by replacement of the cytomegalovirus promoter in pcDNA3 with the promoter for the mouse elongation factor-1α gene (20Kim D.W. Uetsuki T. Kaziro Y. Yamaguchi N. Sugano S. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 217-223Google Scholar). A CSF1R/IR containing a 12-amino acid deletion within the juxtamembrane domain (CSF1R/IRΔ960) was constructed by replacing theSpeI/BglI fragment from the CSF1R/IR with the corresponding 1367-base pair fragment from pSVΔ960 (17Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. Cahill D.A. Ullrich A. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16450-16454Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. CHO cells were maintained in F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. All cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For differentiation, 2 × 104 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were plated/35-mm dish, and the medium was replaced every other day after plating until the cells became confluent. The cells were maintained 2 additional days after reaching confluence without being fed to induce quiescence. After the 3T3-L1 cells had become quiescent, differentiation was induced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 1 μm insulin, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine as described previously (21Harrison S.A. Buxton J.M. Clancy B.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20106-20116Google Scholar). CSF-1 was substituted for insulin at the concentrations indicated. Cells were maintained in the differentiation media for 2 days, at which time the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and either insulin or CSF-1 at the same concentration used to induce differentiation. This media was replaced 2 days later with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum alone. The cells were fed every 2 days thereafter with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum until used. Transfection of CHO K1 cells and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was performed with Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells expressing the CSF1R/IR were selected with G418 and isolated by flow cytometry with a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of the human CSF-1 receptor (22Sherr C.J. Ashmun R.A. Downing J.R. Ohtsuka M. Quan S.G. Golde D.W. Roussel M.F. Blood. 1989; 73: 1786-1793Google Scholar) (Oncogene Science) and fluorescent secondary antibody. Flow cytometry was performed by the University of Nebraska Medical Center Flow Cytometry Core Laboratory. Metabolic labeling with 2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate was performed in phosphate-free DMEM for 2 h at 37 °C as described previously (23Lewis R.E. Volle D.J. Sanderson S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26259-26266Google Scholar). Lysis of cells in 1% Triton X-100 in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors was performed as described previously (23Lewis R.E. Volle D.J. Sanderson S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26259-26266Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed with the indicated antibodies bound to agarose-conjugated protein G. Each portion of polyacrylamide gel containing 32P-labeled receptor was excised and washed successively three times with water and acetone to remove SDS. The32P-labeled receptor protein was digested with 10 μg tosylphenylalanylchloromethyl ketone-trypsin in 300 μl of 0.25% ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, in a clean 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. The tryptic eluate was lyophilized to dryness, and the dried phosphopeptides were reconstituted in 0.2 ml of 6 m HCl. Partial hydrolysis of the phosphopeptides was performed at 110 °C for 1 h, after which the hydrolysate was diluted 6-fold with water, lyophilized, reconstituted with 100 μl of H2O, and lyophilized a second time. Electrophoretic separation of the phosphoamino acids was performed as described (24Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Google Scholar). The plates were dried, and phosphoamino acid standards were visualized with ninhydrin. Radiolabeled phosphoamino acids were identified by autoradiography. For phosphopeptide mapping, the phosphorylated proteins were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The CSF1R/IR and the insulin receptor β subunit were localized by autoradiography and digested twice with 100 μg/ml tosylphenylalanylchloromethyl ketone-trypsin in 0.25% ammonium bicarbonate. Phosphopeptides were separated on a Brownlee Aquapore OD300 column with a gradient of 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 0.25 ml/min. Fractions were collected at 30-s intervals and counted for Cerenkov radiation. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes, and Western blots were developed using anti-Shc (1:250) or anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20 or RC-20) antibodies as specified by the manufacturer (Transduction Laboratories) or using CT-1 (1:5000) (18Ganderton R.H. Stanley K.K. Field C.E. Coghlan M.P. Soos M.A. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 195-205Google Scholar) and anti-IRS-1 (1:800) (25Wilden P.A. Broadway D.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 9-18Google Scholar) antibodies. Blots were developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium using the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase or with the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Corp.). The CSF1R/IR chimera was expressed stably in CHO cells to assess its structure and enzymatic activity. Treatment of cells expressing the CSF1R/IR with CSF-1 for 10 min resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 170-kDa chimeric receptor protein (Fig. 1). Furthermore, tyrosine-phosphorylated CSF1R/IR chimera was precipitated by an antibody directed against the extracellular ligand binding domain of the CSF1R or by monoclonal antibody CT-1, which is specific for the carboxyl terminus of the human insulin receptor (18Ganderton R.H. Stanley K.K. Field C.E. Coghlan M.P. Soos M.A. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 195-205Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). No detectable tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated from CSF-1-treated CHO cells transfected with the expression vector alone (Fig. 1). Insulin did not stimulate phosphorylation of the CSF1R/IR chimera (data not shown). These observations demonstrate the chimeric nature of the CSF1R/IR protein and that it has CSF-1-activated tyrosine kinase activity. The CSF-1 receptor has been placed in the subclass of the family of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases that includes the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and c-kit (26Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Google Scholar). Activation of the tyrosine kinases encoded by these receptors is believed to require ligand-induced dimerization of two identical receptor proteins (26Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Google Scholar). Activation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in the chimera may result from CSF-1-induced dimerization of the CSF1R/IR protein that permits trans-phosphorylation of juxtaposed tyrosine kinase domains (27Frattali A.L. Treadway J.L. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19521-19528Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the proper orientation of juxtaposed tyrosine kinase domains is sufficient for the activation of tyrosine kinase activity. CSF-1 caused a dose-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the CSF1R/IR in intact cells (Fig.2). Quantitative analysis of the anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot indicated that stimulation of the CSF1R/IR tyrosine autophosphorylation was half-maximal at 1 nm CSF-1 and maximal at 10 nm CSF-1. The pattern of phosphorylation of the CSF1R/IR chimera was compared with the pattern of phosphorylation on the insulin receptor β subunit produced by insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of the heterotetrameric insulin receptor (Fig. 3). CSF1R/IR chimeras were immunoprecipitated with antibody CT-1 from32P-labeled and CSF-1-treated CHO cells. Immunoprecipitated CSF1R/IR protein was isolated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Human insulin receptors were similarly isolated from 32P-labeled and insulin-treated CHO cells. Analysis of CSF1R/IR and insulin receptor β subunit phosphopeptide maps revealed a nearly identical distribution of phosphopeptides between the two receptors (Fig.3 A). Phosphoamino acid analysis of the32P-labeled CSF1R/IR chimera revealed the presence of phosphoserine, phosphotyrosine, and only a trace of phosphothreonine (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis of the CSF1R/IR chimera. A, tryptic phosphopeptide map of the human insulin receptor (solid line), and CSF1R/IR chimeric receptor (dashed line). Phosphorylated CSF1R/IR and human insulin receptors were immunoprecipitated from32P-labeled CHOchi.10 and hIRc cells, respectively. CHOchi.10 and hIRc cells were treated with 10 nm CSF-1 or 100 nm insulin, respectively, prior to lysis. Tryptic phosphopeptides were generated and resolved by high-performance liquid chromatography as described under “Materials and Methods.”B, two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis of the CSF1R/IR chimera immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled and CSF-1-treated cells.

Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Google Scholar). The differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocyte responds to insulin in a manner that resembles the normal adipocyte, a primary target of insulin action. The ability of the CSF1R/IR chimera to stimulate biological effects in cells was examined further by transfection of the plasmid pEFCSF1R/IR into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and selection for resistance to G418. Pools consisting of at least seven independent clones expressing the CSF1R/IR were isolated by flow cytometry. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IR (Fig.4) were grown to confluence and quiescence. Differentiation was initiated with dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine, and 1 μm insulin as described previously (21Harrison S.A. Buxton J.M. Clancy B.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20106-20116Google Scholar). Subjecting each 3T3-L1 cell line to the differentiation protocol with dexamethasone and isobutylmethylxanthine alone did not induce the adipocyte phenotype (Fig. 4, left panels). In contrast, microscopic examination of differentiated 3T3-L1 cells revealed that the addition of insulin to the differentiation protocol led to the accumulation of relatively large lipid-containing vesicles in all cell lines (Fig. 4, middle panels). In contrast to insulin treatment, the addition of 25 nm CSF-1 caused the formation of numerous, small lipid-containing vesicles within the cytoplasm of 3T3-L1 cells expressing the CSF1R/IR (Fig. 4, center right panel). Vesicle fusion did not occur in these cells, even when the cells were maintained in culture for up to 17 days following differentiation (data not shown). In contrast, no adipocyte foci were observed throughout the plate of parental 3T3-L1 cells treated with CSF-1 in place of insulin (Fig. 4, upper right panel). These data indicate that expression of the CSF-1/IR chimera is capable of lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells when low doses of CSF-1 are substituted for insulin in the differentiation protocol. The ability of CSF-1 and insulin to differentiate cells expressing a mutated CSF1R/IR lacking 12 amino acids within the juxtamembrane region of the cytoplasmic domain (CSF1R/IRΔ960) was also tested. 3T3-L1 cells expressing the CSF1R/IRΔ960 also accumulated lipid when subjected to the differentiation protocol containing dexamethasone and isobutylmethylxanthine in combination with 1 μminsulin or 25 nm CSF-1 (Fig. 4, lower panels). Lipid vesicle formation in CSF-1-treated 3T3-L1 cell adipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IRΔ960 was more closely akin to that observed in insulin-treated cells (Fig. 4). Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells expressing the CSF1R/IR and CSF1R/IRΔ960 was confirmed by detection of the fatty acid binding protein aP2/422 following CSF-1 treatment (Fig. 5). Relative expression of the fatty acid binding protein was stronger in cells expressing the CSF1R/IRΔ960 than in cells expressing a comparable amount of the intact CSF1R/IR and are closer in magnitude to that observed with insulin treatment of the same cells. These observations are consistent with the relative amount of lipid accumulation in CSF-1-treated 3T3-L1 cells expressing the CSF1R/IRΔ960 as compared with cells expressing the intact CSF1R/IR (Fig. 4). The juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain encodes structures that are important for the recognition and phosphorylation of the intracellular mediators IRS-1 and Shc by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (1White M.F. Livingston J.N. Backer J.M. Lauris V. Ullrich A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 641-649Google Scholar, 4Yonezawa K. Ando A. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kitamura T. Hara K. Nakafuku M. Okabayashi Y.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16610-16622Google Scholar). We tested the ability of CSF-1 to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Shc in 3T3-L1 cells expressing the CSF1R/IR or the CSF1R/IRΔ960. CSF-1 stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Shc (Figs. 6 and7) in 3T3-L1 cells expressing the CSF1R/IR. However, CSF-1 was unable to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 or Shc in cells expressing the CSF1R/IRΔ960 (Figs. 6 and 7). Comparable amounts of IRS-1 and Shc proteins were precipitated from 3T3-L1 cells expressing either the CSF1R/IR or the CSF1R/IRΔ960 (Figs. 6 and 7). CSF-1 was equipotent to IGF I in its ability to stimulate the phosphorylation of IRS-1 in cells expressing the CSF1R/IR (Fig. 6). Interestingly, insulin consistently failed to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc in 3T3-L1 cells expressing the CSF1R/IR, despite the fact that insulin readily induced differentiation of these cells (Fig. 7). In contrast, insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of Shc strongly in 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IRΔ960 (Fig.7).Figure 7CSF-1-dependent phosphorylation of Shc in 3T3-L1 cells expressing the CSF1R/IR and CSF1R/IRΔ960. A, left panel, 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IR or CSF1R/IRΔ960 were incubated with 10 nm CSF-1, 1 μm insulin, or left untreated for 1 min at 37 °C, lysed ,and immunoprecipitated with antibody to Shc. The tyrosine-phosphorylated 52-kDa Shc isoform was detected on a Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20. Right panel,Shc was immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody from identical numbers of the 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing CSF1R/IR or CSF1R/IRΔ960 chimeras used in the left panel. Shc was resolved by Western blot using a mouse monoclonal anti-Shc antibody.B, quantitative analysis of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation shown in A.

The results shown represent the means of three independent experiments; bars,S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The ability of the CSF-1R/IR to generate insulin-like effects in 3T3-L1 cells might be due to the ability of this receptor to transactivate endogenous insulin receptors. This possibility was tested in CHO cells expressing both the human insulin receptor and the CSF1R/IR and in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Fig. 8 demonstrates that the CSF-1 does not stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor β subunit in either transfected CHO cells (A) or in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (B) despite the fact that the insulin receptor and the CSF1R/IR are detected in similar amounts in both cell lines. Similarly, insulin does not stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of the CSF1R/IR in these cells. We have constructed a chimeric growth factor receptor consisting of the extracellular ligand binding domain of the human CSF-1 receptor spliced to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the human insulin receptor. CSF-1 activates the CSF1R/IR tyrosine kinase to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate endogenous proteins in a manner characteristic of the normal insulin receptor. Furthermore, the CSF1R/IR is capable of mediating the CSF-1-dependent differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Deletions within the juxtamembrane domain of the CSF1R/IR that abrogate its ability to phosphorylate IRS-1 and Shc do not inhibit the ability of this mutated chimera to stimulate adipocyte differentiation. Thus, IRS-1 and Shc activation by the insulin receptor kinase does not appear to be essential for the induction of adipocyte differentiation. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes express low levels of high-affinity insulin receptor binding sites prior to differentiation (29Rubin C.S. Hirsch A. Fung C. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7570-7578Google Scholar). High concentrations of insulin (1 μm) are thought to induce differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes through activation of the IGF I receptor (36Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Google Scholar). However, gene targeting of one insulin receptor allele in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes impaired the ability of these cells to differentiate into adipocytes (37Accili D. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4708-4712Google Scholar), suggesting that insulin can play a direct role in the differentiation of the 3T3-L1 cells. The present studies support the notion that the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain is also capable of initiating the intracellular signals sufficient for adipocyte differentiation. The insulin receptor tyrosine kinase domain, which is essential to receptor signaling, shares 84% identity with the tyrosine kinase domain of the IGF I receptor (38Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M. Collins C. Henzel W. Le Bon T. Kathuria S. Chen E. Jacobs S. Franke U. Ramachandran J. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Google Scholar). The juxtamembrane domains of the insulin and IGF I receptors are 61% identical (38Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M. Collins C. Henzel W. Le Bon T. Kathuria S. Chen E. Jacobs S. Franke U. Ramachandran J. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Google Scholar). Furthermore, five of the six known tyrosine autophosphorylation sites in the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain (5Tornqvist H.E. Pierce M.W. Frackelton A.R. Nemenoff R.A. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10212-10219Google Scholar, 6Tornqvist H.E Gunsalus J.R. Nemenoff R.A. Frackelton A.R. Pierce M.W. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 350-359Google Scholar, 7Tavaré J.M. Denton R.M.

Jacobs S. Franke U. Ramachandran J. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that structures conserved between the cytoplasmic domains of the insulin receptor and IGF I receptor are essential components of intracellular signaling pathways that result in adipocyte differentiation. IRS-1 and Shc are substrates for the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and contain structural domains that interact directly with the juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain (39Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trüb T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Google Scholar, 40O'Neill T.J. Craparo A. Gustafson T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6433-6442Google Scholar, 41Gustafson T.A.

Mutations within the insulin receptor juxtamembrane domain abrogate the ability of the insulin receptor to phosphorylate IRS-1 and Shc and couple to intracellular signaling pathways (1White M.F. Livingston J.N. Backer J.M. Lauris V. Ullrich A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 641-649Google Scholar, 4Yonezawa K. Ando A. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kitamura T. Hara K. Nakafuku M. Okabayashi Y.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16610-16622Google Scholar). The ability of juxtamembrane mutations to block IRS-1 and Shc phosphorylation by the insulin receptor kinase is likely due to the loss of phosphorylation at Tyr960. Tyr960 has been shown to be essential for the interaction of the insulin receptor with IRS-1 and Shc (39Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trüb T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E.

Phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase activity is also stimulated primarily through the phosphorylation of IRS-1 (47Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.-J. Miralpeix M. Hu P.

White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29-32Google Scholar, 50Levy-Toledano R. Taouis M. Blaettler D.H. Gorden P. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31178-31182Google Scholar). The observation that the juxtamembrane deletion within the CSF1R/IRΔ960 inhibits CSF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Shc (Figs. 6 and 7) in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts suggests that alternative pathways may be able to mediate the ability of the receptor to stimulate adipocyte differentiation. We cannot exclude the possibility that IRS-1 or Shc proteins might be phosphorylated in 3T3-L1 cells by the CSF1R/IRΔ960 to a small extent during the prolonged period of exposure of 3T3-L1 cells to differentiation medium containing CSF-1. Slow or imperceptible amounts of phosphorylation might not be detected by assay of IRS-1 and Shc phosphorylation following an acute exposure of cells to CSF-1. However, deletion of the juxtamembrane domain from the CSF1R/IR facilitated the accumulation of lipid (Fig. 4) and the expression of the adipocyte-specific fatty acid binding protein aP2/422 (Fig. 5) in cells treated with CSF-1. These observations suggest that IRS-1 or Shc-mediated signaling may not facilitate the accumulation of lipid or the fusion of lipid-containing vesicles. The amount of CSF-1 used to induce adipocyte differentiation (25 nm) is sufficient to maximally activate the CSF1R/IR tyrosine kinase (Fig. 3). The limited degree of CSF-1-induced differentiation we observe in 3T3-L1 cells expressing the intact CSF1R/IR appears consistent with the description of fat cells formed in transgenic mice overexpressing normal Ras protein (51Houseknecht K.L. Zhu A.X. Gnudi L. Hamann A. Zierath J.R. Tozzo E. Flier J.S. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11347-11355Google Scholar). Because IRS and Shc proteins appear to link insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity to Ras, it is interesting to speculate that increased sensitivity to Ras may limit the extent of differentiation. These data suggest that alternative signaling intermediates may be used for transmission of signals from the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain to promote adipocyte differentiation. Additional substrates for the insulin receptor kinase have been identified, including IRS-2 (52Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y.T. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F.

Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Google Scholar), a 115-kDa protein that associates with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHPTP2 (54Yamauchi K. Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17716-17722Google Scholar), and three distinct substrates of molecular weight 53,000–60,000 (55Yeh T.C. Ogawa W. Danielsen A.G. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2921-2928Google Scholar, 56Lavan B.E. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5921-5928Google Scholar, 57Hosomi Y. Shii K. Ogawa W. Matsuba H. Yoshida M. Okada Y. Yokono K. Kasuga M. Baba S. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11498-11502Google Scholar). IRS-2 contains a PTB domain and has been shown to interact with the NPEY motif within the juxtamembrane domain of the insulin and IGF I receptors (58Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Google Scholar, 59He W. Craparo A. Zhu Y. O'Neill T.J. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.H. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11641-11645Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicates that additional sequences within IRS-2 may also interact with the insulin receptor (58Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Google Scholar, 59He W. Craparo A. Zhu Y. O'Neill T.J. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.H. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11641-11645Google Scholar). Gab-1 shares homology with IRS-1 and IRS-2 but does not encode a PTB domain (53Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Google Scholar). Thus, the juxtamembrane domain of the insulin receptor may not be essential for the phosphorylation of Gab-1 by the tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor. The potential role of these substrates in regulating insulin-induced adipocyte differentiation is not yet known. The CSF1R/IR chimera provides an opportunity to explore the role of specific cytoplasmic structures in the induction of adipocyte differentiation. Additional autophosphorylation sites capable of associating with SH2 domain-containing proteins reside in the carboxyl-terminal tail and within the catalytic domain. The role of the carboxyl-terminal tail of the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain in regulating metabolic and mitogenic signaling (2Maegawa H. McClain D.A. Friedenberg G. Olefsky J.M. Napier M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 7917-7922Google Scholar), as well as differentiation, can be similarly explored in insulin-responsive cell types with the CSF1R/IR chimera. Additional alterations of the CSF1R/IR cytoplasmic domain will provide the opportunity to probe for structures within the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain that may be necessary for the induction of differentiation and other biological events.

Analysis of Ii-transferrin receptor chimeras expressed in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells shows that the Ii cytoplasmic tail contains a dihydrophobic basolateral sorting signal, Met16-Leu17, which is recognized in both the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways. Pro15-Met16-Leu17 has previously been identified as one of two dihydrophobic Ii internalization signals active in non-polarized cells. Pro15 is also required for endocytosis in MDCK cells but not for basolateral sorting, indicating that the internalization signal recognized at the plasma membrane is distinct from the sorting signal recognized by basolateral sorting machinery. Another dihydrophobic sequence, Leu7-Ile8, is required for rapid internalization of the chimeric receptors in MDCK cells but not for basolateral sorting, providing further evidence that the structural requirements for basolateral sorting and internalization differ. Deletion analysis suggests that basolateral sorting of newly synthesized Ii-TR chimeras is also mediated by the membrane-proximal region of the Ii cytoplasmic tail. However, this region does not promote polarized basolateral recycling, indicating that the structural requirements for polarized sorting in the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways are not identical.

However, this region does not promote polarized basolateral recycling, indicating that the structural requirements for polarized sorting in the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways are not identical. Polarized epithelial cells have structurally and functionally distinct plasma membrane domains with distinct protein and lipid compositions (reviewed in Refs. 1Mostov K. Apodaca G. Aroeti B. Okamoto C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 577-583Google Scholar and 2Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 395-427Google Scholar). In simple epithelia, the apical membrane faces the external environment and is specialized for secretion and nutrient absorption, while the basolateral membrane is in contact with the underlying tissue and performs fundamental cellular functions, such as intercellular adhesion and nutrient uptake from the blood supply. To generate and maintain polarity, membrane proteins which function at either the apical or basolateral border must be delivered to the appropriate cell-surface domain. In Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) 1The abbreviations used are: MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; Ii, human invariant chain; TR, human transferrin receptor; FcR, Fc receptor II B2 isoform; CEF, chicken embryo fibroblasts; RSV(A), Rous sarcoma virus subtype A; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Tf, human transferrin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; IiCT, Ii cytoplasmic tail; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; MHC, major histocompatibility complex. cells, most newly synthesized apical and basolateral membrane proteins comigrate through the Golgi complex and are selectively delivered to either the apical or basolateral surface (3Rindler M.J. Ivanov I.E. Plesken H. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1304-1319Google Scholar, 4Fuller S.D. Bravo R. Simons K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 297-307Google Scholar). Studies during the past few years have established that polarized biosynthetic delivery to the basolateral surface requires distinct sorting signals located within the cytoplasmic domains of trafficking membrane proteins (5Mostov K.E. de Bruyn Kops A. Deitcher D.L. Cell. 1986; 47: 359-364Google Scholar, 6Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Google Scholar, 7Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-77Google Scholar, 8Hunziker W. Harter C. Matter W. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 66: 907-920Google Scholar). Basolateral sorting signals which have been identified within the cytoplasmic domains of trafficking membrane proteins can be distinguished based upon whether or not they are colinear with internalization signals (reviewed in Ref. 9Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Google Scholar). Most basolateral sorting signals which overlap with internalization signals are dependent for activity upon the same tyrosine residue found to be important for endocytosis. In some cases, however, the structural requirements for basolateral sorting and internalization differ (10Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Google Scholar, 11Prill V. Lehmann L. von Figura K. Peters C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2181-2193Google Scholar), demonstrating that the signal recognized by the basolateral sorting machinery is not identical to the signal recognized within plasma membrane clathrin-coated pits. Members of the other class of basolateral sorting signal, which are spatially separate from endocytic motifs, include the membrane-distal basolateral sorting signal of the low density lipoprotein receptor (10Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Google Scholar) and the basolateral sorting signal of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (12Thomas D.C. Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3313-3320Google Scholar), both of which are tyrosinedependent, as well as the basolateral sorting signal of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, which does not depend upon tyrosine for activity (13Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 123Google Scholar). Two basolateral sorting signals have been identified which are similar to dihydrophobic sorting signals that are known to mediate delivery to the endocytic pathway directly from the biosynthetic pathway or from the plasma membrane via endocytosis (reviewed in Ref. 14Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Google Scholar). A dileucine sequence in the cytoplasmic tail of the Fc receptor II B2 isoform (FcR) is required for both basolateral sorting and endocytosis (15Hunziker W. Fumey C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2963-2969Google Scholar, 16Matter K. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 991-1004Google Scholar), demonstrating that this signal belongs to the class of basolateral sorting signals which are colinear with internalization signals. In contrast, a Leu-Val sequence targets newly synthesized CD44 to the basolateral surface but does not promote internalization (17Sheikh H. Isacke C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12185-12190Google Scholar). However, endocytosis of CD44 may be inhibited by direct submembranous interactions between its cytoplasmic domain and the cytoskeleton, preventing clustering in plasma membrane clathrin-coated pits (18Lokeshar V.B. Fregien N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1099-1109Google Scholar). The trans-Golgi network is generally considered to be the primary site for polarized basolateral sorting in MDCK cells (2Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 395-427Google Scholar, 19Wandinger-Ness A. Bennett M.K. Antony C. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 987-1000Google Scholar), although direct evidence for this is lacking. However, to maintain their polarized cell-surface distribution, basolateral membrane proteins which are rapidly internalized via clathrin-coated pits must be efficiently recycled back to this surface. Recent studies have shown that mutations which impair the polarized basolateral delivery of newly synthesized low density lipoprotein receptor and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor also lead to an increase in basolateral-to-apical transcytosis of these proteins, suggesting that in each protein, the same basolateral sorting signal is recognized in both the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways (20Matter K.J. Whitney A.J. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. Cell. 1993; 74: 1053-1064Google Scholar, 21Aroeti B. Mostov K.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2297-2304Google Scholar). The MHC class II-associated invariant chain (Ii) assembles with newly synthesized class II αβ dimers in the endoplasmic reticulum and targets them to an endocytic processing compartment in which antigenic peptides are encountered (22Wolf P.R. Ploegh H.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 267-306Google Scholar). Ii contains within its cytoplasmic domain two independent sorting signals, Leu7-Ile8 and Pro15-Met16-Leu17, related to dihydrophobic signals. Each sorting signal in Ii promotes rapid endocytosis (23Pieters J. Bakke O. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 831-846Google Scholar, 24Bremnes B. Madsen T. Gedde-Dahl M. Bakke O. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2021-2032Google Scholar, 25Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Google Scholar), and the same or closely related signals are required for intracellular sorting and direct delivery of Ii to the endocytic pathway, which is the predominant route along which class II αβ-Ii complexes are transported (25Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Google Scholar, 26Benaroch P. Yilla M. Raposo G. Ito K. Miwa K. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 37-49Google Scholar). Ii and MHC class II molecules are normally restricted to professional antigen-presenting cells, such as B lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. However, expression of both Ii and class II molecules in non-immune epithelial cells can be induced by interferon-γ (27Baudeau C. Delarue F. He C.J. Nguyen G. Adida C. Peraldi M.N. Sraer J.D. Rondeau E. Exp. Nephrol. 1994; 2: 306-312Google Scholar,28Colgan S.P. Parkos C.A. Matthews J.B. D'Andrea L. Awtrey C.S. Lichtman A.H. Delp-Archer C. Madara J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C402-410Google Scholar). We have investigated the sorting of Ii in epithelial cells by analyzing the trafficking of Ii-transferrin receptor (TR) chimeras expressed in MDCK cells. We find that the cytoplasmic domain of Ii targets newly synthesized chimeric receptors to the basolateral surface, where they are rapidly internalized. Endocytosed chimeras which recycle to the surface are selectively delivered to the basolateral border, indicating that the cytoplasmic tail of Ii is also recognized by the basolateral sorting machinery in the endocytic pathway. By analysis of mutant Ii-TR chimeras, we demonstrate that a dihydrophobic sorting signal consisting of Met16-Leu17 functions as a basolateral sorting signal which is required for polarized sorting in the endocytic pathway and is involved in basolateral sorting in the biosynthetic pathway. Deletion analysis suggests additional basolateral sorting information resides in the membrane-proximal region of the Ii cytoplasmic tail that is recognized within the biosynthetic pathway but not the endocytic pathway. Both dihydrophobic sequences Leu7-Ile8 and Pro15-Met16-Leu17 that independently mediate efficient endocytosis in nonpolarized cells (23Pieters J. Bakke O. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 831-846Google Scholar, 24Bremnes B. Madsen T. Gedde-Dahl M. Bakke O. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2021-2032Google Scholar, 25Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Google Scholar) are required for internalization activity in MDCK cells. However, neither Leu7-Ile8 nor Pro15 are required for basolateral sorting of Ii-TR chimeras in MDCK cells providing clear evidence that there are different structural requirements for basolateral sorting and internalization in these cells. Thus, dihydrophobic sorting signals within the cytoplasmic tail of Ii are differentially recognized by the basolateral sorting machinery located within the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways and by plasma membrane clathrin-coated pits. Construction of human Ii-TR chimeras and expression in chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) using the retroviral vector RCAS-BP(A) derived from Rous sarcoma virus subtype A (RSV(A)) (29Hughes S. Petropoulos C. Federspiel M. Sutrave P. Forry-Schaudies S. Bradac J. J. Reprod. Fert. Suppl. 1990; 41: 39-49Google Scholar) has been previously described (25Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Google Scholar). Since both Ii and TR are type II membrane proteins, the polarity of the polypeptide sequence with respect to the membrane is maintained. Recombinant virus produced by transfected CEF was concentrated by centrifugation of 10 ml of tissue culture supernatant at 23,000 rpm for 2.5 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW40 Ti rotor. The pelleted virus was resuspended in 1 ml of DMEM, then passed through a 0.45-μm filter. The receptor for RSV(A) (30Bates P. Young J.A.T. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 1043-1051Google Scholar) has been stably expressed in MDCK II cells, rendering them susceptible to infection by RSV(A) (31Odorizzi G. Pearse A. Domingo D. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 139-152Google Scholar). MDCK cells derived from a clone expressing the RSV(A) receptor were plated at 105 cells/well of a 24-well tissue culture dish (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) and 12 h later were incubated with concentrated recombinant RCAS-BP(A) virus for 12 h at 37 °C. Afterward, 1 ml of growth medium was added, and the cells were grown to confluency. Expression of mutant human Ii-TR chimeras was analyzed by immunofluorescence using B3/25, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the extracellular domain of the receptor, and a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Cooper Biomedical, Malvern, PA). Individual clones of MDCK cells expressing human Ii-TR chimeras were isolated by limited dilution. MDCK cells expressing human Ii-TR chimeras were plated at high density (1.5 × 106) onto 24-mm diameter Costar Transwell polycarbonate filters (0.4 μm pore size) (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) and cultured for 3 days, with the media changed on the second day. 125I-Labeled diferric human transferrin (Tf) (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) was prepared by incubating 500 μg of Tf with 40 μg of chloramine T (Sigma) and 0.5–1.0 mCi of Na125I (Amersham) in a total volume of 150 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The reaction was stopped by adding 80 μg of sodium metabisulfite (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) in 10 μl of PBS. 125I-Labeled Tf was separated from free125I on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated in PBS. To determine the steady-state cell-surface distribution of human Ii-TR chimeras, filter-grown cells were incubated in DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C, then shifted to 4 °C and washed with PBS+ (PBS with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (BSA-PBS+). Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 4 μg/ml 125I-labeled Tf in BSA-PBS+ added to either side of the monolayer (150 μl basolaterally or 350 μl apically). Under these conditions, less than 0.1% of the 125I-labeled Tf crossed the monolayers. Cells were then washed 3 times at 4 °C with BSA-PBS+ (2 ml/monolayer surface), and the amount of radioactivity specifically bound to the cells was determined by excising the filters and counting them in a γ-counter. MDCK cells expressing human Ii-TR chimeras were plated at a density of 7.5 × 104 cells/cm2 in a 24-well Costar tissue culture plate and cultured at 37 °C for 1 day. The cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of serum-free DMEM, then incubated with 150 μl of 4 μg/ml 125I-labeled Tf in DMEM containing 0.5% BSA (BSA-DMEM) for 1 h at 37 °C. The media was removed, and the cells were washed three times at 4 °C with 1 ml of BSA-PBS+, then incubated at 4 °C twice for 3 min with 0.5 ml of 0.2 m acetic acid, 0.5 mNaCl (pH 2.4) to remove surface-bound 125I-labeled Tf (32Hopkins C.R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 508-521Google Scholar). Cells were removed from the wells with 2 washes in 0.5 ml of 1m NaOH, and radioactivity in the acid wash and the cell lysate was determined. Prolonged incubation with the acid wash did not affect the radioactivity released (33Jing S. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Google Scholar). The internalization efficiencies of mutant human Ii-TR chimeras relative to the wild-type human TR were determined from the steady-state intracellular distribution of 125I-labeled Tf and calculated as described previously (25Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Google Scholar, 33Jing S. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Google Scholar). Filter-grown MDCK cells expressing human Ii-TR chimeras were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM (2 ml/monolayer surface) containing 0.5 mCi/ml35S-labeled methionine-cysteine (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) and 1% dialyzed fetal bovine calf serum. Monolayers were then washed 2 times with DMEM and chased for 20 or 40 min at 37 °C in DMEM containing a 10-fold excess of unlabeled methionine and cysteine. The cells were then chilled with 2 washes in ice-cold DMEM at 4 °C and incubated for 30 min in DMEM containing 100 μg/ml trypsin added to either the apical or the basolateral surface (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ). DMEM containing 100 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) was added to the opposite surface. Tryptic cleavage of surface TR generates a soluble ∼70-kDa extracellular domain fragment which was immunoprecipitated from the apical and basolateral media using B3/25 mAb and analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (34Omary M.B. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12888-12892Google Scholar). Dried gels were exposed to flashed XAR film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY), and quantitation of radioactivity was performed on a model 425 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). No TR tryptic fragments were detected in immunoprecipitates of media containing trypsin inhibitor. Filter-grown MDCK cells expressing human Ii-TR chimeras were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM, then for 1 h at 37 °C with 4 μg/ml 125I-labeled Tf in BSA-DMEM (150 μl basolaterally and 350 μl apically). Cells were then washed 3 times at 4 °C with BSA-DMEM (2 ml/monolayer surface), and surface-bound Tf was removed with >95% efficiency using deferoxamine mesylate as described previously (31Odorizzi G. Pearse A. Domingo D. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 139-152Google Scholar, 33Jing S. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Google Scholar). Cells were then washed 3 times with BSA-DMEM at 4 °C and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min in BSA-DMEM containing 100 μg/ml unlabeled Tf (1 ml/monolayer surface). Afterward, the radioactivity released into the apical and basolateral media, as well as the cell associated radioactivity, was determined. To investigate the trafficking of Ii in polarized epithelial cells, we expressed in MDCK cells wild-type and mutant Ii-TR chimeras (Fig. 1) that had previously been expressed in CEF (25Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Google Scholar) using a retroviral vector derived from RSV(A) (29Hughes S. Petropoulos C. Federspiel M. Sutrave P. Forry-Schaudies S. Bradac J. J. Reprod. Fert. Suppl. 1990; 41: 39-49Google Scholar, 35Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 79-98Google Scholar). Recombinant retrovirus produced by CEF was used to infect MDCK cells in which the 157-amino acid isoform of the receptor for RSV(A) (30Bates P. Young J.A.T. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 1043-1051Google Scholar) had been expressed (31Odorizzi G. Pearse A. Domingo D. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 139-152Google Scholar). The steady-state cell-surface distributions of Ii-TR chimeras in filter-grown MDCK monolayers were subsequently determined by measuring the binding of 125I-labeled human Tf at the apical and basolateral surfaces at 4 °C. As shown in Fig. 2, a chimera (IiCT) consisting of the 30-residue amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail of Ii (p33 isoform) and the transmembrane and extracellular domains of TR was localized predominantly at the basolateral surface, similar to the polarized cell-surface distribution of the wild-type TR (31Odorizzi G.

Deletion of residues 2–11 of the Ii cytoplasmic tail resulted in a modest decrease in the polarized steady-state basolateral cell-surface expression of chimeric receptors (Fig. 2). However, deletion of residues 2–17 led to almost a complete loss of basolateral polarity (Fig. 2), although a small but significantly greater fraction of this mutant chimera was found at the basolateral border when compared with the distribution of the tailless TR (Δ3–59) in MDCK cells (31Odorizzi G.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 139-152Google Scholar).Figure 2Sorting information in the Ii cytoplasmic tail targets Ii-TR chimeras to the basolateral surface of MDCK cells. Filter-grown MDCK cells expressing IiCTchimeras were incubated either apically or basolaterally for 1 h at 4 °C with 125I-labeled Tf (4 μg/ml). After washing away unbound Tf, the amount of 125I-labeled Tf specifically bound on each surface was determined (mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments). Values for the distributions of wild-type and tailless (Δ3–59) TR, shown for comparison, are from Odorizziet al. (31Odorizzi G. Pearse A. Domingo D. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 139-152Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Located within residues 2–17 of the Ii cytoplasmic tail are two dihydrophobic sorting signals (Leu7-Ile8 and Pro15-Met16-Leu17) which independently promote rapid internalization in non-polarized cells (23Pieters J. Bakke O. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 831-846Google Scholar, 24Bremnes B. Madsen T. Gedde-Dahl M. Bakke O. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2021-2032Google Scholar, 25Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Google Scholar). However, Leu7-Ile8 are not required for basolateral localization, as alteration of both residues to alanine did not affect the polarized steady-state expression of IiCT chimeras at the basolateral surface (Fig. 2). We next investigated whether Pro15-Met16-Leu17 is involved in basolateral targeting by examining the cell-surface distributions of previously constructed IiCT chimeras in which each of these residues had been individually altered to alanine in the context of an Ii cytoplasmic tail in which Leu7-Ile8 had also been changed to alanine (25Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that alteration of Pro15 to alanine resulted in only a small decrease in the selective steady-state basolateral distribution of IiCTchimeras, suggesting that this residue has, at most, a minor role in basolateral sorting. However, a random cell-surface distribution resulted from the substitution of alanine for Met16. A similar result was obtained if Met16 had been altered to alanine in the context of the wild-type Ii cytoplasmic tail in which Leu7-Ile8 were intact (Fig. 2), confirming that Met16, but not Leu7-Ile8, is required for selective basolateral expression of IiCTchimeras. Fig. 2 shows that Leu17 is required for basolateral polarity as well, although alteration of this residue more significantly impaired basolateral localization. The steady-state level of the L17A mutant chimera on the basolateral surface is lower than predicted from the independent measurements of the biosynthetic delivery and recycling of the mutant (see Figs. 4 and5) and, therefore, may reflect differences in either the rates of internalization or degradation of the mutant chimera from the basolateral and apical surfaces. Previous studies of Ii-TR chimeras in non-polarized cells indicated that Gly18 has no role in high efficiency endocytosis (25Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Google Scholar). Similarly, substitution of alanine for Gly18 had no effect on the basolateral expression of chimeric receptors in MDCK cells (Fig. 2). These results, therefore, indicate that Met16 and Leu17 are important for the polarized basolateral localization of IiCT chimeras in MDCK cells, whereas Pro15 is not required.Figure 5Met16-Leu17, but not the membrane-proximal region, are required for basolateral sorting of Ii-TR chimeras in the endocytic pathway of MDCK cells.Filter-grown MDCK cells expressing Ii-TR chimeras were incubated basolaterally at 37 °C for 1 h with 125I-labeled Tf. Monolayers were then washed at 4 °C, and surface-bound125I-labeled Tf was removed with deferoxamine mesylate. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 90 min, and the appearance of125I-labeled Tf in the apical and basolateral media was determined (mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments). More than 90% of the internalized 125I-labeled Tf recycled after 90 min at 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In non-polarized cells, both Leu7-Ile8 and Pro15-Met16-Leu17 independently mediate high efficiency endocytosis (23Pieters J. Bakke O. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 831-846Google Scholar, 24Bremnes B. Madsen T. Gedde-Dahl M. Bakke O. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2021-2032Google Scholar, 25Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Google Scholar). Therefore, since only Met16-Leu17, but not Leu7-Ile8, were found to be important for basolateral localization, we next investigated whether rapid endocytosis in MDCK cells was mediated by the same internalization signals previously characterized in non-polarized cells. As in CEF (25Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Google Scholar), the IiCT chimera was rapidly internalized in MDCK cells with an efficiency similar to that of wild-type TR (Fig. 3). High efficiency endocytosis was completely abrogated by deletion of residues 2–17 in the Ii cytoplasmic tail. Interestingly, rapid internalization was also completely abolished in MDCK cells by independently altering either of the Leu7-Ile8 or Leu14-Pro15 dipeptides to two alanine residues (Fig. 3), mutations which in CEF impair internalization by only ∼50% (25Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Google Scholar). Individual substitution of alanine for Met16 also completely abrogated rapid internalization in MDCK cells (Fig. 3), supporting the conclusion that the Leu7-Ile8and Pro15-Met16-Leu17 sequences identified as independent internalization signals in non-polarized cells can only act in concert to mediate rapid endocytosis in MDCK cells. The polarized basolateral steady-state cell-surface distribution of TR in MDCK cells has been demonstrated to result from the basolateral sorting of both newly synthesized and recycling receptors (31Odorizzi G. Pearse A. Domingo D. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 139-152Google Scholar). Therefore, we first investigated the biosynthetic cell-surface delivery of Ii-TR chimeras by pulse labeling newly synthesized chimeric receptors with35S-labeled methionine-cysteine and chasing them to the surface of filter-grown monolayers for 20 or 40 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the apical or basolateral surface was incubated in trypsin at 4 °C, which cleaves the receptor near the transmembrane region, resulting in the release of an ∼70-kDa extracellular fragment which was immunoprecipitated using B3/25 mAb (34Omary M.B. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12888-12892Google Scholar) and quantitated following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and PhosphorImager analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, newly synthesized IiCT chimeras were efficiently sorted to the basolateral surface, as were mutant chimeras in which residues 2–11 had been deleted from the cytoplasmic tail. As expected from their basolateral polarity seen at steady state (Fig. 2), mutant IiCT chimeras in which Leu7-Ile8 were altered to alanine were also sorted biosynthetically to the basolateral surface with high efficiency (Fig. 4). Interestingly, deletion of residues 2–17 resulted in only a modest decrease in the basolateral polarity of cell-surface delivery (∼75%), suggesting that"

Cells continuously monitor various chemical and physical parameters in their surrounding environment and use this information to implement appropriate adaptive responses to changing conditions. This vital task is accomplished by a cascade of transient protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events arranged so that the flow of phosphoryl groups reflects environmental conditions. One ubiquitous class of signal transduction networks is the “two-component” regulatory systems that control diverse processes such as behavior, development, physiology, and virulence in bacteria, as well as adaptive processes in eukaryotes (for reviews, see Refs. 1Parkinson J.S.

The first component is a histidine protein kinase, which autophosphorylates using ATP as the phosphodonor. The second component is a response regulator protein, which transfers the phosphoryl group from the histidine protein kinase to itself. Response regulators are also capable of autophosphorylation using small molecule phosphodonors such as acetyl phosphate (5Lukat G.S. McCleary W.R. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Phosphorylation alters the activity of the response regulator, thereby generating a response (e.g. change in gene expression) to the environmental stimulus. Our goal is to understand in atomic detail the effects of phosphorylation on response regulator structure and function. The best characterized response regulator is the bacterial chemotaxis protein CheY, which has been the subject of extensive genetic, biochemical, and biophysical analyses.

Chem. 1991; 266: 8348-8354Google Scholar). The structure of CheY-P has not yet been determined due to the fact that the phosphoryl group has a half-life of only a few seconds on CheY (8Wylie D. Stock A. Wong C.-Y. Stock J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 891-896Google Scholar, 9Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Kaplan N. Simon M.I. Cell. 1988; 53: 79-87Google Scholar). We adopted a mutational approach to determine the active conformation of CheY. Phosphorylation is not the only route to response regulator activation. Mutations that result in constitutive activity have been isolated for many response regulators. In the case of CheY, replacement of Asp13 with lysine (the D13K mutant) results in clockwise flagellar rotation (25Bourret R.B. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 41-45Google Scholar, 26Bourret R.B. Drake S.K. Chervitz S.A. Simon M.I. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13089-13096Google Scholar). Genetic evidence that the CheY D13K protein is activated in the absence of phosphorylation implies that the phosphoryl group does not play a direct role in the mechanism of CheY signal transduction, such as phosphotransfer to a downstream protein, or direct binding (25Bourret R.B. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 41-45Google Scholar, 26Bourret R.B. Drake S.K. Chervitz S.A. Simon M.I. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13089-13096Google Scholar). These results, plus biochemical evidence that CheY activation does not involve a change to a multimeric state (25Bourret R.B. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 41-45Google Scholar, 27Roman S.J. Meyers M. Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6247-6255Google Scholar), lead to the conclusion that the indirect role of phosphorylation is to generate a conformational change that allows CheY to interact productively with the flagellar switch. NMR data show that CheY undergoes a conformational change upon phosphorylation (28Drake S.K. Bourret R.B. Luck L.A. Simon M.I. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13081-13088Google Scholar, 29Lowry D.F. Roth A.F. Rupert P.B. Dahlquist F.W. Moy F.J. Domaille P.J. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26358-26362Google Scholar). Presumably, this conformational change is mimicked by constitutively active mutants such as CheY D13K. The two routes of activation (phosphorylation versus the D13K mutation) are thought to have the same mechanistic features because Lys109 is essential for both (24Lukat G.S. Lee B.H. Mottonen J.M. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8348-8354Google Scholar, 26Bourret R.B. Drake S.K. Chervitz S.A. Simon M.I. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13089-13096Google Scholar). We therefore solved the x-ray crystal structure of the D13K CheY mutant to find the activated conformation of CheY. CheY D13K was purified as described previously (30Hess J.F. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 188-204Google Scholar), except on a larger scale. A 100 liter culture of KO641recA/pRBB40.13DK (25Bourret R.B. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 41-45Google Scholar) was grown in LB + 100 μg/ml ampicillin in a fermentor at 37 °C. Expression of CheY D13K was induced at a cell turbidity of A 595 = 1 by addition of 3β-indoleacrylic acid to 100 μg/ml final concentration. Cells were harvested after 2 h. Approximately 11 liters of cell paste were lysed by sonication and clarified by centrifugation. TEDG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% v/v glycerol) was used throughout the purification procedure. The cell lysate was loaded onto a 2.5 × 10 cm (50 ml) Affi-Gel Blue column, washed, and eluted with a 0–0.6 m NaCl gradient. Two passes were required on the Blue column to separate the D13K from the flow-through. The fractions containing the D13K were pooled, desalted by dilution, and concentrated in a stirred cell ultrafiltration unit with a PM10 membrane (Amicon, Inc.). The concentrated D13K was loaded on a 2.5 × 10 cm (50 ml) DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column and immediately eluted with 0.025 m NaCl. CheY D13K was found to bind to DEAE less tightly than wild-type CheY, presumably due to the +2 charge change resulting from the mutation. Finally, all fractions containing D13K were pooled, concentrated with Centricon-10 concentrators (Amicon, Inc.), and applied to a Superose 12 HR16/50 fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Fractions containing pure D13K were stored at −20 °C. Approximately half of the CheY D13K (molecular mass = 14 kDa) passed through the PM10 filter (molecular mass cutoff 10 kDa) at the pre-DEAE step. Passage through the filter resulted in substantial purification, so this material was retrieved, concentrated in a stirred cell ultrafiltration unit with a YM5 membrane (Amicon, Inc.), and chromatographed separately on the DEAE column. The overall yield from both halves of the purification process was 28 mg of D13K. The purified protein was precipitated in a solution of 3.2 m ammonium sulfate, centrifuged, redissolved in a minimal volume of 80 mmammonium sulfate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and brought to a final concentration of 15 mg/ml. The protein was then loaded into 20-μl microdialysis chambers, each sealed with dialysis membrane. Ammonium sulfate was the precipitant used in the crystallization trials. The critical ammonium sulfate concentration for nucleation and crystallization was found to be 2.2 m. The pulsed-diffusion method (31Koeppe R.E., II Stroud R.M. Pena V.A. Santi D.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 155-160Google Scholar) was used as described previously (32Volz K. Beman J. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4723-4725Google Scholar) for optimization of crystal size and quality, where graduated up- and down-pulses were explored over the range of 0.1–2.5 m ammonium sulfate. The crystal used for data collection grew to dimensions of 0.90 × 0.08 × 0.08 mm. Mg2+ is required in the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions of wild-type CheY (5Lukat G.S. McCleary W.R. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 718-722Google Scholar, 21Lukat G.S. Stock A.M Stock J.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5436-5442Google Scholar, 33Hess J.F. Bourret R.B. Oosawa K. Matsumura P. Simon M.I. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 53: 41-48Google Scholar). However, Mg2+ binding to CheY D13K is not detectable by either resonance shifts in 19F NMR spectra of 4-fluorophenylalanine-labeled protein or by quenching of Trp58 fluorescence (28Drake S.K. Bourret R.B. Luck L.A. Simon M.I. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13081-13088Google Scholar, 34Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S.-I. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10470-10476Google Scholar). Lack of metal ion binding to the mutant protein is consistent with the observation that in wild-type CheY, Asp13 is directly involved in coordination of the Mg2+ ion (15Stock A.M. Martinez-Hackert E. Rasmussen B.F. West A.H. Stock J.B. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13375-13380Google Scholar, 16Bellsolell L. Prieto J. Serrano L. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 489-495Google Scholar). Furthermore, D13K is phosphorylated only very slowly in the presence of the histidine protein kinase CheA and ATP (26Bourret R.B. Drake S.K. Chervitz S.A. Simon M.I. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13089-13096Google Scholar, 27Roman S.J. Meyers M. Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6247-6255Google Scholar), and apparently not at all in the presence of acetyl phosphate (34Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S.-I. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10470-10476Google Scholar). Thus, crystallization of CheY D13K in the absence of both Mg2+ and phosphate is biologically relevant. Crystals of the CheY D13K mutant were indistinguishable from those of wild-type CheY, belonging to the orthorhombic space group P212121, with unit cell dimensions of a = 45.9 Å, b = 47.0 Å, andc = 54.0 Å. Diffraction data were collected from one crystal at the area detector facility at Argonne National Laboratory. The crystal was exposed for a total of ∼42 h in graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation from a rotating anode x-ray generator (50 kV, 100 mA) passing through a 0.3-mm collimator. Data were recorded at a crystal to detector distance of 100 mm on a Siemens multiwire area detector, with a swing angle of 15° in 2θ for a theoretical upper resolution limit of 2.26 Å. Data processing and reduction was done using the XENGEN program package (35Howard A. Gilliland G.L. Finzel B.C. Poulos T.L. Ohlendorf D.H. Salemme F.R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 383-390Google Scholar). The cell parameters determined by XENGEN deviated from wild-type by only 0.26%.

Open table in a new tab Because the CheY D13K crystals were isomorphous with those of wild-type apoCheY, phasing of the D13K structure was initiated with a phase calculation using the wild-type structure with all solvent molecules excluded, and residue 13 was modeled as an alanine. Refinement of atomic positions was done using the restrained least squares method (36Hendrickson W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 252-270Google Scholar). The R-factor smoothly converged to a final value of 14.3% after a total of 110 cycles of refinement interspersed with 10 partial rebuilds. 4,432 reflections greater than 2ς in the resolution range 10–2.26 Å were used in the final refinement.

Universities of Western Australia and Maryland, Perth, Australia1988Google Scholar) and several locally developed programs. The least squares refinement was done with the software packages PROTIN and PROFFT (36Hendrickson W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 252-270Google Scholar, 38Finzel B.F. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 53-55Google Scholar). Visualization of the electron density maps and model rebuilding were done using the graphics package FRODO (39Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 157-171Google Scholar) on an Evans and Sutherland PS300 system. The electron density maps from the final ‖2F o −F c ‖αcalc and ‖F o − F c ‖αcalcdifference Fourier calculations are clear and well defined for the entire backbone of the molecule. The average thermal parameters for all protein atoms is 13.8 Å2 (Fig. 1). The final coordinate set consists of 1108 atoms, of which 1003 are protein and 105 are solvent molecules with unit occupancies. Clearly defined electron density for the entire lysine residue at position 13 confirms the amino acid substitution (Fig.2). The amino group of the Lys13 side chain makes no interactions with other groups of the active site. Instead, the side chain is in a fairly extended conformation (χ1–4 = 70°, −156°, 152°, and 123°, respectively), where the ε-amino group has weak hydrogen bonding contacts with external solvent molecules. The non-ideal value of χ4 is due to a close, non-bonding contact of the terminal group with the side chain of Asn59. Although the lysine side chain at position 13 appears capable of assuming an alternate rotameric position (t) away from the active site with no steric restrictions, its observed position (g −) in the structure blocks access to the active site, especially the Mg2+ binding region. This is consistent with the fact that the CheY D13K mutant does not bind Mg2+ (34Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S.-I. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10470-10476Google Scholar) and exhibits essentially no phosphorylation ability (26Bourret R.B. Drake S.K. Chervitz S.A. Simon M.I. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13089-13096Google Scholar, 27Roman S.J. Meyers M. Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6247-6255Google Scholar, 34Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S.-I. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10470-10476Google Scholar). A least squares superposition of the Mg2+-free, wild-type, and D13K mutant CheY structures shows a root mean square difference in positions of equivalent α-carbon atoms of just 0.21 Å and reveals only one significant difference in the position of backbone atoms, 0.71 Å for the α-carbon of Lys13, the site of the mutational change (Fig. 3). There are only two side chains that differ in position by any significant extent between the two structures, Asp12 and Asp57 (Fig. 4). In the CheY D13K structure, Asp12 is rotated by −50° about its χ2bond, where its Oδ1 atom establishes a hydrogen bond with the amide nitrogen of Phe14. Similarly, Asp57is rotated by −60° about its χ2 bond, so the Asp57 Oδ2 atom loses its hydrogen bond with the amide nitrogen of Asn59. The new position of the Asp57 side chain is 1.1 Å closer to the Mg2+binding site, a site now unoccupied because of the occlusion by the Lys13 side chain. This repositioning of Asp57eliminates its strong interaction with the ε-amino group of Lys109 seen in the wild-type CheY structure. The only other change in the CheY D13K mutant is the pronounced lack of order in the solvent structure of the active site. In wild-type CheY, the active site contains some of the best ordered solvent molecules, whereas in the D13K structure, the solvent is poorly ordered and with much higher temperature factors and weaker hydrogen bonding geometries (Fig.4). The presumably inactive, nonphosphorylated, wild-type CheY and the presumably activated D13K mutant CheY have backbone conformations in the crystalline state that are indistinguishable within experimental error. There are three possibilities that could account for this result. First, activation of CheY might not involve a conformational change. There is at least one example of lack of conformational changes in an enzyme following phosphorylation (40Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3599-3602Google Scholar, 41Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Sohl J.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Science. 1990; 249: 1012-1016Google Scholar), concerning the regulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase. However, this explanation does not apply to CheY because it is inconsistent with all previous experimental data (25Bourret R.B. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 41-45Google Scholar, 27Roman S.J. Meyers M. Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6247-6255Google Scholar, 28Drake S.K. Bourret R.B. Luck L.A. Simon M.I. Falke J.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26358-26362Google Scholar) as described in the Introduction. Second, both proteins might have crystallized in the active conformation. This is unlikely because the conformation observed in crystalline CheY D13K is the same as wild-type, apoCheY, both crystalline (13Stock A.M. Mottonen J.M. Stock J.B. Schutt C.E. Nature. 1989; 337: 745-749Google Scholar, 14Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15511-15519Google Scholar, 15Stock A.M. Martinez-Hackert E. Rasmussen B.F. West A.H. Stock J.B. Ringe D.

Pascual J. Lopez E. Serrano L. Rico M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 717-725Google Scholar), and the conformation of wild-type CheY has been shown to change upon Mg2+ binding (15Stock A.M.

Bourret R.B. Luck L.A. Simon M.I. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13081-13088Google Scholar,29Lowry D.F. Roth A.F. Rupert P.B. Dahlquist F.W. Moy F.J. Domaille P.J. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26358-26362Google Scholar). Thus, these results strongly suggest the third possibility that the conformation of D13K observed here does not represent the activated state of CheY. There are three possible explanations why the D13K CheY mutant might have crystallized in an inactive conformation. First, it might assume the active conformation only upon binding to the flagellar switch. This seems improbable, and also not readily testable. Second, in solution, D13K might truly mimic the phosphorylation-induced conformational changes that are critical for activation, but lattice forces prevent the solution-state conformational change from occurring in the crystal. This seems unlikely in view of the facts that the crystallization conditions, crystal morphology, space group, and unit cell dimensions were identical for Mg2+-free, wild-type CheY and D13K. Finally, the CheY molecule may normally exist in equilibrium between the active and inactive conformations, and either phosphorylation or the D13K mutation could serve to shift a sufficient fraction of the population into the activated state to generate clockwise flagellar rotation in vivo (Fig. 5). With this explanation, the observed, crystalline conformation of CheY D13K would be a metastable state, the conformation of the inactive majority of the population, which could transform to the activated form in solution. This possibility is consistent with results from 1H- and15N-NMR spectroscopy on CheY D13K, which allow for a small percent of the D13K mutant molecule to be in an alternate conformation, rapidly interconverting with its resting state. 2D. Lowry and F. W. Dahlquist, unpublished observations. CheY binds specifically to three different proteins: CheA, which donates the phosphoryl group to CheY (43McNally D.F. Matsumura P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6269-6273Google Scholar, 44Schuster S.C. Swanson R.V. Alex L.A. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Nature. 1993; 365: 343-347Google Scholar, 45Swanson R.V. Schuster S.C. Simon M.I.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14626-14636Google Scholar); CheZ, which stimulates dephosphorylation of CheY-P (43McNally D.F. Matsumura P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6269-6273Google Scholar, 47Blat Y. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 902-906Google Scholar, 48Blat Y. Eisenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1226-1231Google Scholar, 49Blat Y. Eisenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1232-1236Google Scholar); and FliM, the recipient of the activating signal of CheY, located in the flagellar switch complex (34Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S.-I. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10470-10476Google Scholar, 50Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S.-I. Eisenbach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8787-8791Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of wild-type CheY reduces binding to CheA but enhances binding to CheZ and FliM. Measurement of the binding affinities between CheY D13K and each of these three proteins may therefore indicate the degree of structural similarity between CheY D13K and CheY-P. D13K binds to CheA with about 2-fold lower affinity than nonphosphorylated wild-type CheY (46Li J. Swanson R.V. Simon M.I. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14626-14636Google Scholar, 51Shukla D. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24414-24419Google Scholar), but its binding affinities for CheZ (47Blat Y. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 902-906Google Scholar) and FliM (34Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S.-I. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10470-10476Google Scholar) are the same as nonphosphorylated wild-type rather than the enhanced affinities expected for an activated conformation of CheY-P. Thus, the in vitro protein binding assays suggest that CheY D13K only partially assumes the activated conformation in solution. Several other observations support the hypothesis that CheY D13K exists in a metastable state, in a conformation that can easily convert to the activated form. First, the hyper-signaling activity of CheY D13K is observed in a strain containing a multicopy plasmid (25Bourret R.B. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 41-45Google Scholar) but is substantially reduced when the mutant protein is expressed from a single copy chromosomal gene (26Bourret R.B. Drake S.K. Chervitz S.A. Simon M.I. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13089-13096Google Scholar). Second, the in vivoactivity of wild-type CheY is increased by simple overexpression (52Clegg D.O. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5056-5060Google Scholar), and there is evidence that nonphosphorylated wild-type CheY possesses a low level of clockwise-generating activity (10Barak R. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1821-1826Google Scholar). Finally, in the case of another response regulator, OmpR, overproduction of the non-phosphorylatable mutant D55Q (position 55 being the site of phosphorylation of OmpR) generates the phenotype characteristic of wild-type OmpR-P (53Kanamaru K. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. 1992; 111: 425-430Google Scholar). The CheY molecule contains six phenylalanine residues. Four of these (Phe8, Phe30, Phe53, and Phe124) are clustered far from the active site, Phe14 is solvent exposed, and Phe111 is buried underneath Lys109. 19F-NMR spectra obtained with 4-fluorophenylalanine-labeled CheY D13K did not show any differences in the environments of Phe8, Phe30, Phe53, and Phe124 between wild-type CheY and CheY D13K (26Bourret R.B. Drake S.K. Chervitz S.A. Simon M.I. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13089-13096Google Scholar), suggesting that the D13K substitution does not induce a conformational change in this remote region. This is consistent with the conformation observed in the CheY D13K crystal structure. The resonance for 4-fluorophenylalanine-labeled Phe111 was perturbed, perhaps reflecting an effect of the D13K substitution on the position of Lys109. However, the environment of Phe111 is essentially identical in the crystal structures of wild-type CheY and CheY D13K. The only structural differences in the crystallographic results involve the two aspartate residues, Asp12 and Asp57, discussed above, which are more than 7 Å away from Phe111. Thus, the19F-NMR work also suggests that CheY D13K adopts a conformation in solution different than that observed in the crystal structure presented here. In summary, the crystal structure of the constitutively active D13K mutant of CheY surprisingly has no conformational differences when compared with the Mg2+-free form of the wild-type CheY molecule. Thus the CheY D13K structure presented here is the inactive form of the molecule, and the interpretation is that only in solution does this form proceed to a conformation resembling activated CheY."

An ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) is included among the few cellular protein substrates of this enzyme. An octapeptide (GLYASKLS-NH2) derived from a N-terminal Arf sequence was used as the starting point to identify elements critical for recognition by the acyltransferases's peptide-binding site.In vitro kinetic studies, employing purified Nmt and a panel of peptides with single Ala substitutions at each position of GLYASKLS-NH2, established that its Gly1, Ser5, and Lys6 residues play predominant roles in binding. ALYASKLS-NH2 was found to be an inhibitor competitive for peptide (K i = 15.3 ± 6.4 μm) and noncompetitive for myristoyl-CoA (K i = 31.2 ± 0.7 μm). A survey of 26 derivatives of this inhibitor, representing (i) a complete alanine scan, (ii) progressive C-terminal truncations, and (iii) manipulation of the physical-chemical properties of its residues 1, 5, and 6, confirmed the important stereochemical requirements for the N-terminal amine, the β-hydroxyl of Ser5, and the ε-amino group of Lys6. Remarkably, replacement of the the N-terminal tetrapeptide of ALYASKLS-NH2 with an 11-aminoundecanoyl group produced a competitive inhibitor, 11-aminoundecanoyl-SKLS-NH2, that was 38-fold more potent (K i = 0.40 ± 0.03 μm) than the starting octapeptide. Removing the primary amine (undecanoyl-SKLS-NH2), or replacing it with a methyl group (dodecanoyl-SKLS-NH2), resulted in 26- and 34-fold increases in IC50, confirming the important contribution of the amine to recognition. Removal of LeuSer from the C terminus (11-aminoundecanoyl-SK-NH2) yielded a competitive dipeptide inhibitor with a K i (11.7 ± 0.4 μm) equivalent to that of the starting octapeptide, ALYASKLS-NH2.

Unlike isogenic NMT/NMT or NMT/nmtΔ strains,nmtΔ/nmt447D cells require myristate for their growth in rich media at 24 and 37°C. Removing myristate results in cell death (8Weinberg R.A. McWherter C.A. Freeman S.K. Wood D.C. Gordon J.I. Lee S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 241-250Google Scholar). This lethality correlates with levels of cellular proteinN-myristoylation. Arf is completelyN-myristoylated in the NMT/nmtΔ strain, whether it is grown in the presence or absence of myristate at 24 or 37°C. When nmtΔ/nmt447D cells are grown at 24°C in media supplemented with myristate, most (>75%) of cellular Arf isN-myristoylated. However, 2 or 4 h after withdrawal of myristate, the level of N-myristoylated Arf falls to <50% of total cellular Arf (9Lodge J.K. Jackson-Machelski E. Devadas B. Zupec M.E. Getman D.P. Kishore N. Freeman S.K. McWherter C.A. Sikorski J.A. Gordon J.I. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 357-366Google Scholar). Attenutation of Nmt activity also compromises the ability of these organisms to survive in vivo.The NMT/Δnmt strain produces 100% lethality within 7 days after intravenous administration into a group of immunosuppressed mice. However, when an identical number of nmtΔ/nmt447Gcells are infused into immunosuppressed animals, no death is observed even after 21 days (8Weinberg R.A. McWherter C.A. Freeman S.K. Wood D.C. Gordon J.I. Lee S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 241-250Google Scholar). Protein N-myristoylation occurs co-translationally and appears to be irreversible (reviewed in Ref. 10Bhatnagar R.S. Gordon J.I. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 14-20Google Scholar). Nmt has a preferred order reaction mechanism (11Rudnick D.A. McWherter C.A. Rocque W.J. Lennon P.J. Getman D.P. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9732-9739Google Scholar, 12Rocque W.J. McWherter C.A. Wood D.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9964-9971Google Scholar, 13Bhatnagar R.S. Jackson-Machelski E. McWherter C.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11045-11053Google Scholar). The apoenzyme first binds myristoyl-CoA to form a myristoyl-CoA·Nmt binary complex which is competent for peptide binding. Following generation of a myristoyl-CoA·Nmt·peptide ternary complex and catalytic transfer of myristate to the glycyl amine, the CoA and myristoylpeptide products are released. In vitro kinetic analyses using a large panel of myristoyl-CoA analogs and purified human and fungal Nmts indicate that the requirements for molecular recognition at the enzymes' acyl-CoA-binding site have been highly conserved throughout the course of eukaryotic evolution (e.g. Refs. 4Lodge J.K. Johnson R.L. Weinberg R.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2996-3009Google Scholar and 14Kishore N.S. Wood D.C. Mehta P.P. Wade A.C. Lu T. Gokel G.W. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4889-4902Google Scholar). However, differences in peptide substrate specificities have been noted among orthologous Nmts in vitro (4Lodge J.K. Johnson R.L. Weinberg R.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2996-3009Google Scholar, 9Lodge J.K. Jackson-Machelski E. Devadas B. Zupec M.E. Getman D.P. Kishore N. Freeman S.K. McWherter C.A. Sikorski J.A. Gordon J.I.

Chem. 1995; 38: 1837-1840Google Scholar). These differences can be exploited to develop species-specific enzyme inhibitors. To design such inhibitors of C. albicans Nmt, the subsite specificity of the enzyme for peptide ligands needs to be defined. To begin this process, we have systematically replaced each amino acid residue in a known, high affinity, Arf-derived octapeptide substrate with alanine. Having identified the importance of residues 1, 5, and 6 in molecular recognition, we then synthesized an additional series of peptides and de-peptidized analogs containing various substituents at these critical positions. Protected amino acids were obtained from Applied Biosystems, Inc. or Bachem California.tert-Butyloxycarbonyl (t-Boc)-protected 11-aminoundecanoic acid was purchased from Omni Biochem.t-Boc-4-aminobutanoic,t-Boc-5-aminopentanoic,t-Boc-6-aminohexanoic, and t-Boc-8-aminooctanoic acids were synthesized using the method of Tarbell et al.(17Tarbell D.S. Yamamoto Y. Pope B.M. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 730-732Google Scholar). With the exception of position 1 derivatives of ALYASKLS-NH2 (see below), all peptides were produced usingt-Boc-protected amino acids and an Applied Biosystems Model 470A automated synthesizer. Peptides were cleaved from the solid support resin and de-protected by treatment with anhydrous HF:anisole (10:1) for 60 min at 5°C. After evaporation of HF, the peptide resin was extracted with ether and then 10% acetic acid. The acid washings were combined, diluted with water, and lyophilized. Peptides were subsequently purified by reverse phase HPLC and characterized by HPLC, amino acid analysis, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. All peptides used in this study were >95% pure. Peptides incorporating substitutions in position 1 of ALYASKLS-NH2 were prepared by the standard orthogonal solid-phase peptide synthesis protocol (18Stewart J.M. Young J.D. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis.2nd Ed. Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL1984Google Scholar) using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-protected amino acids. After de-protection with piperdine, washing and drying of the resin, the peptides were cleaved using 95% trifluoroacetic acid containing trace thiol for 2 h. The peptide product was collected by filtration, diluted, and lyophilized, and the product purified by HPLC. Characterization and purity of the position 1 peptides were similar to that of peptides produced by automated t-boc synthesis. C. albicans Nmt was expressed in Escherichia coli strain JM101 and purified to apparent homogeneity using procedures described in Ref. 19Wiegand R.C. Carr C. Minnerly J.C. Pauley A.M. Carron C.P. Langner C.A. Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8591-8598Google Scholar. A coupled in vitro Nmt assay was utilized to determine peptide kinetic parameters (12Rocque W.J. McWherter C.A. Wood D.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9964-9971Google Scholar). In a typical reaction, myristoyl-CoA was generated using [3H]myristate, CoA, andPseudomonas acyl-CoA synthetase (12Rocque W.J. McWherter C.A. Wood D.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9964-9971Google Scholar). The final reaction mixture (110 μl) contained variable amounts of peptide, 0.23 or 0.3 μm [3H]myristoyl-CoA, and purified C. albicans Nmt (10–100 ng). After a 10-min incubation at 24°C, the [3H]myristoylpeptide product was purified by reverse phase HPLC (12Rocque W.J. McWherter C.A. Wood D.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9964-9971Google Scholar) and quantitated using an in-line flow scintillation detector (Radiomatic A250, Packard). K m andV max were calculated using nonlinear regression analysis of the initial velocities with the program k·cat (version 1.55, Biometallics, Princeton, NJ). All experiments were performed in triplicate and assays were repeated on at least two separate occasions. Assays (110 μl) contained variable amounts of inhibitor, 0.11 nmol of purified [3H]myristoyl-CoA (1 μCi, 9.09 Ci/mmol), 2.2 nmol of GNAASARR-NH2, and 7–12 ng of purified C. albicans Nmt in reaction buffer (buffer = 200 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmEGTA). Incubations were allowed to proceed for 10 min at 24°C. Assays were performed in duplicate and repeated at least once. K i values for inhibitors were determined using methods described earlier (16Devadas B. Zupec M.E. Freeman S.K. Brown D.L. Nagarajan S. Sikorski J.A. McWherter C.A. Getman D.P. Gordon J.I. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 1837-1840Google Scholar). Briefly, competition against peptide was evaluated by varying the concentrations of two previously characterized peptide substrates, GNAASARR-NH2 or GARASVLS-NH2 (19Wiegand R.C. Carr C. Minnerly J.C. Pauley A.M. Carron C.P. Langner C.A. Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8591-8598Google Scholar), between 5 and 80 and 5 and 40 μm, respectively, and fixing the concentration of purified[3H]myristoyl-CoA at 1 μm. Competition against myristoyl-CoA was evaluated by varying the concentration of the acyl-CoA between 0.165 and 2.64 μm and fixing the concentration of GNAASARR-NH2 at 20 μm. Reactions were begun by adding the purified fungal Nmt to a final concentration of 1.2–2.2 nm. The acylpeptide product was quantitated as described above. Data are reported as apparent inhibition constants and were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis of double-reciprocal (Lineweaver-Burk) plots using k·cat. Both competitive and noncompetitive models were tested. Arf proteins are produced in a wide variety of species and many are known to be substrates for Nmtsin vivo (e.g. Refs. 20Stearns T. Kahn R.A. Botstein D. Hoyt M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6690-6699Google Scholar, 21Lee F.-J.S. Stevens L.A. Kao Y.L. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20931-20937Google Scholar, 22Kahn R.A.

An octapeptide representing the N terminus of C. albicans Arf (GLTISKLF-NH2) is a substrate for purified C. albicans Nmt in vitro (K m = 0.6 μm; V max = 48,000 pmol/min/mg enzyme). GLYASKLF-NH2 representing the N terminus ofS. cerevisiae Arf2p is also accommodated by C. albicans Nmt (K m = 0.4 μm). Previous studies had shown that a derivative of GLYASKLF-NH2 containing a Phe8 → Ser substitution (GLYASKLS-NH2) is a high affinity substrate for S. cerevisiae Nmt1p (K m = 0.07 μm; Ref. 12Rocque W.J. McWherter C.A. Wood D.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9964-9971Google Scholar). Subsequent replacement of its Gly1 with Ala (ALYASKLS-NH2; Ref.25Rudnick D.A. Rocque W.J. McWherter C.A. Toth M.V. Jackson-Machelski E. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1087-1091Google Scholar) yielded the first known high affinity competitive peptide inhibitor of an Nmt (K i = 5 μm with purifiedS. cerevisiae Nmt1p). Based on these observations, we chose GLYASKLS-NH2 to begin our identification of functional groups required by the binary C. albicansNmt·myristoyl-CoA complex for recognition of its peptide ligands. TableI shows the kinetic effects of replacing residues in GLYASKLS-NH2 with Ala. Substitution of Ala at position 1 (ALYASKLS-NH2) represents addition of a methyl group to the α-carbon of Gly. The result is to transform a substrate to an inhibitor (IC50 = 29 ± 4 μm; see Table I). Double-reciprocal plots established that the inhibition was competitive versus peptide (K i = 15.3 ± 6.4 μm) and noncompetitive versusmyristoyl-CoA (K i = 31.2 ± 0.7 μm) (Fig. 1, A andB). ALYASKLS-NH2 does not serve as a substrate: experiments employing a wide range of Nmt, [3H]myristoyl-CoA, and peptide concentrations failed to yield detectable amounts of product ([3H]myristoyl-ALYASKLS; see legend to TableI).Table IAlanine scanning of an octapeptide substrate (GLYASKLS-NH2) and an inhibitor (ALYASKLS-NH2)K mV maxV max/K mμmpmol min−1 mg Nmt−1×10−3A, alanine scan of GLYASKLS-NH2GLYASKLS-NH20.28 ± 0.0332,960 ± 1,320118ALYASKLS-NH2NS1-aNS, not a substrate: i.e. no acylpeptide formation was observed at peptide concentrations in excess of 1 mm with greater than 10 μg of enzyme after incubation periods >2 h.NSNSGAYASKLS-NH20.10 ± 0.018,630 ± 40486GLAASKLS-NH20.32 ± 0.0213,000 ± 16641GLYGSKLS-NH24.1 ± 0.39137,800 ± 9,52034GLYAAKLS-NH22,800 ± 3951-bK m is approximate because the value exceeds the maximum solubility of this peptide.5,100 ± 6000.0018GLYASALS-NH266 ± 9.673,600 ± 8,2201.1GLYASKAS-NH20.78 ± 0.0564,750 ± 2,50083GLYASKLA-NH20.26 ± 0.0253,930 ± 2,250207GLYASKL.-NH20.25 ± 0.0459,300 ± 4,550237GLYASK..-NH21.7 ± 0.1684,660 ± 6,68050GLYAS...-NH2NSNSNSIC 50μmB, alanine scan of ALYASKLS-NH2ALYASKLS-NH229 ± 4AAYASKLS-NH24ALAASKLS-NH216 ± 1ALYGSKLS-NH2333 ± 23ALYAAKLS-NH21520 ± 50ALYASALS-NH22680 ± 50ALYASKAS-NH2264 ± 11ALYASKLA-NH246 ± 8IC50μmC, truncations of ALYASKLS-NH2ALYASKL.-NH231 ± 1ALYASK..-NH2337 ± 571-a NS, not a substrate: i.e. no acylpeptide formation was observed at peptide concentrations in excess of 1 mm with greater than 10 μg of enzyme after incubation periods >2 h.1-b K m is approximate because the value exceeds the maximum solubility of this peptide. Open table in a new tab Substitution of an Ala for the Leu2 in GLYASKLS-NH2 replaces an isobutyl group with a methyl. There was a modest 3-fold reduction in K m which was offset by a 4-fold drop in V max. Substitution of an Ala for its Tyr3 replaces a p-hydroxybenzyl with a methyl and had insignificant effects on these kinetic parameters (Table I). The importance of the α-methyl group of Ala4 was explored by placing Gly at this position (GLYGSKLS-NH2). Removal of the methyl group results in a 15-fold increase inK m and a 4-fold augmentation ofV max (Table I). Replacement of Ser5 with Ala can be viewed as a substitution of a hydrogen for a hydroxyl. The effect of this substitution is much more dramatic than any of the alterations at positions 1–4: K m increases by at least 10,000-fold and V max decreases 6-fold, resulting in a catalytic efficiency (V max/K m) which is 66,000-fold lower than that of the parental octapeptide, GLYASKLS-NH2 (Table I). The aminoalkyl side chain in the adjacent Lys6 also appears to play an important role in recognition: replacement of this Lys with Ala results in a 236-fold increase in K m (Table I). As in the case of Leu2, replacement of Leu7with Ala produces only minor (2–3-fold) effects onK m and V max (Table I). Finally, unlike the dependence on the hydroxyl of Ser at position 5, replacement of Ser with Ala at position 8 produces no significant change in K m and a less than 2-fold alteration inV max. The results of the scanning alanine mutagenesis suggest that C. albicans Nmt recognizes the Arf substrate based in large part on the nature of functional groups present at residues 1, 5, and 6. This hypothesis was supported by an alanine scan of ALYASKLS-NH2(Table I). Substitution of Leu2 increases inhibitory potency by 7-fold while placing Ala at positions 3 and 8 produces no significant change in IC50. Introducing Ala at positions 4 and 7 results in ∼10-fold reductions in inhibitory activity. However, replacement of Ser5 and Lys6 changes the IC50 from 29 ± 4 to 1520 ± 50 μmand 2680 ± 50 μm, respectively (50- and 90-fold increases; Table I). C-terminal truncations of the parental substrate (GLYASKLS-NH2) and inhibitor (ALYASKLS-NH2) also revealed the important contribution of Lys6. Comparison of GLYASKL-NH2, GLYASK-NH2, and GLYAS-NH2 (Table I) established that (i) deletion of Ser8 has no significant effect on kinetic parameters; (ii) deletion of Leu7-Ser8 produces a modest 7-fold increase in K m and a 5-fold augmentation ofV max, and (iii) removal of Lys6-Leu7-Ser8 results in barely detectable amounts of product, even when enzyme and peptide concentrations are increased 10–100-fold over that used for assaying the other peptides. Similarly, loss of Leu7-Ser8 from ALYASKLS-NH2 only produces a 10-fold reduction in IC50 (Table I). We reasoned that if positions 1, 5, and 6 of ALYASKLS-NH2 provide essential elements for recognition by Nmt, then it might be possible to de-peptidize this parental inhibitor by removing the nonessential residues and replacing them with hydrocarbon linkers. However, before attempting such an exercise, we further defined structure-activity relationships at these three positions to obtain additional information about the spectrum of functional groups that might be incorporated into de-peptidized inhibitors. Options for replacing the N-terminal amino acid were explored by examining the effects of (i) adding different α carbon substituents; (ii) removing, substituting for, or masking the nitrogen acceptor; and (iii) altering the distance between this nitrogen and the Ser-Lys dipeptide. The results are presented in Table II. A comparison of l- and d-Ala revealed that substitution of the d-isomer abolishes inhibitory activity (IC50 >1000 versus 29 ± 4 μm). This finding suggests that either an α-amino or methyl group, or both, in the R-configuration prevents binding to the binary myristoyl-CoA·Nmt complex. Extension of the side chain at position 1 by substituting the methyl with either a propargyl or a propylguanidino group yielded compounds (S-propargylglycine-LYASKLS-NH2 andN-l-arginyl-LYASKS-NH2) that have similar inhibitory activities (IC50 = 51 ± 4 and 54 ± 6 μm, respectively) asl-alanyl-LYASKLS-NH2. These results indicate that the peptide recognition site of the myristoyl-CoA·Nmt complex is able to accommodate marked variations in the polarity and steric bulk, but not in the stereochemistry, of the α carbon side chain of residue 1.Table IIIC50 values for inhibition of C. albicans Nmt by ALYASKLS-NH2 position 1 variants Open table in a new tab When the primary amine of GLYASKLS-NH2 is replaced with a hydroxyl (N-hydroxyacetyl-LYASKLS-NH2), capped with an N-methyl group (N-sarcosyl-LYASKLS-NH2), or its charge neutralized by acetylation (N-acetylglycyl-LYASKLS-NH2), there are no remarkable effects on inhibitory activity (IC50 changes <3-fold; Table II). When the amine nitrogen is removed entirely (N-acetyl-LYASKLS-NH2), the IC50increases 8-fold (225 ± 2 μm). The hydroxyl,N-methyl, and N-acetylglycyl substituents all have heteroatom H-bond donor and acceptor groups that may mimic the amine present in GLYASKSL-NH2, but which is absent fromN-acetyl-LYASKLS-NH2. The distance between the terminal H-bond donor or acceptor group and the interior Ser-Lys dipeptide is sensed by the enzyme.N-Acetyl-LYASKLS-NH2 can be viewed as an analog lacking a terminal amine but having a heteroatom more proximal to the Ser-Lys dipeptide than ALYASKLS-NH2. In addition, altering the distance by substituting Ala with N-β-alanyl (IC50 = 108 ± 1 μm) orN-methylcarbamoyl (IC50 = 82 ± 3 μm) also compromises inhibitory activity (3–4-fold compared with their ALYASKLS-NH2 parent). Because of the potential to build product-like or transition state-like binding modes into a de-peptidized derivative, we also added two groups that extend from the terminal nitrogen: myristate (yielding the product N-myristoylglycyl-LYASKLS-NH2) and an N-2,2′-difluoro-3-ketohexadecanoyl group (yielding a possible tetrahedral transition-state mimic; cf. Ref. 26Brodbeck U. Schweikert K. Gentinetta R. Rottenberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 567: 357-369Google Scholar). These compounds are only marginally better inhibitors (IC50= 5 ± 1 and 17 ± 0.3 μm, respectively) than ALYASKLS-NH2 (29 ± 4 μm) (TableII). Changing the stereochemistry of Ser5 orO-methylation markedly attenuates the inhibitory activity of ALYASKLS-NH2 (IC50 increases to 920 ± 110 and 522 ± 30 μm; Table III). Neither the isosteric hydroxyl in Thr nor the OH group of Asp effectively substitutes for the side chain hydroxyl in l-Ser (Table III).Table IIIInhibitory potency of derivatives of ALYASKLS-NH2 with substitutions at positions 5 and 6Position 5Position 6Amino acidsIC50Amino acidsIC50μmμmd-Ser920 ± 110d-Lys220 ± 30Ser(OMc)522 ± 30Arg105 ± 20Thr500Orn244 ± 5Asp>1000Nle300 Open table in a new tab Substituting d-Lys at position 6 of ALYASKLS-NH2 is deleterious (8-fold increase in IC50 to 220 ± 30 μm) but is not as damaging as changing the stereochemistry at Ser5 (30-fold increase; Table III). Arg6 is inferior to Lys6(4-fold increase in IC50) but is slightly better tolerated than the shortened aminoalkyl side chain of Orn (8-fold increase). Comparison of Nle6 (10-fold increase in IC50) and Lys6 emphasizes the importance of a primary amine at this position (Table III). The alanine scan of ALYASKLS-NH2 established that amino acids 2 or 3 could be substituted with modest or no effects on inhibitory potency. As a prelude to de-peptidization, both Leu2 and Tyr3of ALYASKLS-NH2 were replaced by Ala (AAAASKLS-NH2). This “simplified” compound was 7-fold more potent an inhibitor (IC50 = 4 ± 1 μm) than its parent (Table IV).Table IVDe-peptidization of ALYASKLS-NH2IC50μmSimplification of ALYASKLS-NH2ALYASKLS-NH229 ± 4AAAASKLS-NH24 ± 1Depeptidization of ALYASKLS-NH24-Aminobutanoyl-YASKLS-NH20.53 ± 0.045-Aminopentanoyl-YASKLS-NH20.16 ± 0.016-Aminohexanoyl-YASKLS-NH20.44 ± 0.0311-Aminoundecanoyl-SKLS-NH20.49 ± 0.04Removal of the primary amineUndecanoyl-SKLS-NH212.7 ± 1.3Dodecanoyl-SKLS-NH216.6 ± 1.3Role of amide bondsGlycyl-8-aminooctanoyl-SKLS-NH211.3 ± 1.25-Aminopentanoyl-5-aminopentanoyl-SKLS-NH22.2 ± 0.3C-terminal truncations5-Aminopentanoyl-YASKL . -NH20.42 ± 0.015-Aminopentanoyl-YASK . . -NH27.1 ± 0.145-Aminopentanoyl-YAS … -NH2>100011-Aminoundecanoyl-SKL . -NH21.2 ± 0.111-Aminoundecanoyl-SK . . -NH214.5 ± 1.6Position 4 structure-activity series5-Aminopentanoyl-YGSKL-NH232 ± 45-Aminopentanoyl-Y-d-alanyl-SKL-NH2>10005-Aminopentanoyl-Y-sarcosyl-SKL-NH27.2 ± 1.45-Aminopentanoyl-YSSKL-NH239 ± 15-Aminopentanoyl-YVSKL-NH20.17 ± 0.025-Aminopentanoyl-YISKL-NH20.40 ± 0.065-Aminopentanoyl-YLSKL-NH20.88 ± 0.325-Aminopentanoyl-Y-phenylglycyl-SKL-NH261 ± 25-Aminopentanoyl-Y-t-butylalanyl-SKL-NH225 ± 25-Aminopentanoyl-YFSKL-NH24.6 ± 0.15-Aminopentanoyl-Y-cyclohexylalanyl-SKL-NH255 ± 25-Aminopentanoyl-Y-norleucyl-SKL-NH22.6 ± 0.65-Aminopentanoyl-Y-norvalyl-SKL-NH20.34 ± 0.075-Aminopentanoyl Y-propargylglycyl-SKL-NH21.25 ± 0.075-Aminopentanoyl-Y-aminoisobutyryl-SKL-NH245 ± 0.35-Aminopentanoyl-Y-cyclopropylglycyl-SKL-NH2100Position 5 structure-activity series11-Aminoundecanoyl-homoseryl-K-NH217011-Aminoundecanoyl-cis-4-hydroxylprolyl-K-NH2100011-Aminoundecanoyl-YK-NH243 ± 4Position 6 structure-activity series11-Aminoundecanoyl-S-d-lysyl-NH2>100011-Aminoundecanoyl-S-norleucyl-L-NH260 ± 211-Aminoundecanoyl-S-ε-N-acetyllysyl-L-NH298 ± 111-Aminoundecanoyl-SH-NH221 ± 0.911-Aminoundecanoyl-S-d-histidyl-NH2>100011-Aminoundecanoyl-S-1-methylhistidyl-NH2>100011-Aminoundecanoyl-S-3-methylhistidyl-NH2>100011-Aminoundecanoyl-S-p-aminophenylalanyl-NH2>1000 Open table in a new tab Our initial approach for de-peptidization was to replace the N-terminal two residues of ALYASKLS-NH2 with an aminoalkyl moiety of comparable length. Remarkably, when aminopentanoyl was used to replace the 6 backbone atoms of Ala1-Leu2, the resulting compound, 5-aminopentanoyl-YASKLS-NH2, was 180-fold more potent than the starting octapeptide (IC50 = 0.16 ± 0.01 versus 29 ± 4 μm; Table IV). Further kinetic analysis confirmed that it was a competitive inhibitor for peptide (K i = 0.133 ± 0.019 μm). Experiments employing a large (2,000-fold) excess of Nmt over that used in standard assays, a 10-fold increase in incubation time, and up to 1000 μm5-aminopentanoyl-YASKLS-NH2 failed to yield detectable amounts of [3H]myristoyl-peptide analog, thereby establishing that this compound does not serve as a Nmt substrate. There were only minimal (3-fold) increases in IC50 when the chain length of the aminoalkyl group was adjusted by adding or subtracting one methylene (4-aminobutanoyl- and 6-aminohexanoyl-YASKLS-NH2, respectively; Table IV). This indicates that (i) the fungal enzyme is able to both measure and tolerate one atom variation in the length of the flexible alkyl chain, and (ii) a 6-atom linker is the optimal length for replacement of the N-terminal dipeptide. As noted above, deletion of Ser8 in ALYASKLS-NH2 produces no effect on its inhibitory activity while deletion of Leu7-Ser8 results in 10-fold reduction in potency (cf. Table I). Virtually identical results were noted when these residues were deleted from 5-aminopentanoyl-YASKLS-NH2 (Table IV). Further C-terminal truncation, i.e. removing Lys from 5-aminopentanoyl-YASK-NH2, produced an inactive tripeptide (IC50 >1000 μm) with only two of the three postulated essential elements for recognition. When the α-methyl group of Ala4 was removed in ALYASKLS-NH2 and GLYASKLS-NH2 by Gly substitution, the IC50 increased 10-fold and theK m rose 15-fold, respectively. Therefore, before proceeding with further de-peptidization, we explored the importance of Ala in the minimal fully active, 5-aminopentanoyl-containing compound (5-aminopentanoyl-YASKL-NH2). Sixteen derivatives were examined (Table IV). The methyl group of Ala “remains” important: replacement with Gly results in a 76-fold reduction in inhibitory activity (IC50 = 32 ± 4 versus 0.42 μm). The stereochemistry of this methyl is critical since substitution of l-Ala with d-Ala produces a >2000-fold reduction in potency. Moving the methyl group from the α-carbon to the amide nitrogen (alanine → sarcosine) is poorly tolerated (17-fold reduction). Appending a hydroxyl to the methyl group (Ser) produces a 90-fold reduction in potency. Amino acids with branched, moderately bulky side chains (Val, Ile, and Leu) are equivalent to or slightly better than Ala (IC50 = 0.17–0.88 μm). Substitutents with greater bulk, phenylglycine, t-butylalanine, phenylalanine, cyclohexylalanine, and norleucine, are deleterious (IC50 values increase 6–145-fold relative to 5-aminopentanoyl-YASKL-NH2). Norvaline and propargylglycine contain slightly smaller unbranched side chains that are tolerated by Nmt (IC50 = 0.34 ± 0.17 and 1.25 ± 0.07 μm, respectively). The geminal di-substituted aminoisobutyrate and cyclopropylglycine residues both have a pronounced negative impact on inhibition (IC50 = 45 and 100 μm), further confirming that substitutions at the α-carbon corresponding to the R-configuration have a pronounced negative effect on inhibition. Although Nmt is sensitive to the physical-chemical properties of residues occupying the place of Ala in these 5-aminopentanoyl-containing analogs, we found that this Ala and its adjacent Tyr could be replaced with an alkyl moiety of comparable length, producing an inhibitor, 11-aminoundecanoyl-SKLS-NH2, that was still 60-fold more potent (IC50 = 0.49 ± 0.04 μm) than the starting ALYASKLS-NH2 octapeptide. Like ALYASKLS-NH2 and 5-aminopentanoyl-YASKLS-NH2, 11-aminoundecanoyl-SKLS-NH2 exhibits a competitive pattern of inhibition versus peptide (K i = 0.40 ± 0.03 μm). This synthetic organic-peptide hybrid retains the three critical elements of recognition defined from the original alanine scan and truncations of ALYASKLS-NH2: an N-terminal primary amine, a Ser5 hydroxyl, and an ε-amino group at position 6. Removing the primary amine from 11-aminoundecanoyl-SKLS-NH2(undecanoyl-SKLS-NH2), or replacing it with a methyl group (dodecanoyl-SKLS-NH2), results in substantial reductions in inhibitory potency (26- and 34-fold, respectively, as defined by IC50; Table IV), thereby confirming the importance of this amine for recognition by Nmt. Substitution of the N-terminal tetrapeptide of ALYASKLS-NH2with an 11-aminoundecanoyl group removes three backbone amide bonds. The contribution of these bonds to recognition was evaluated by preparing two compounds, one with an amide bond analogous to that linking Ala1-Leu2(glycyl-8-aminooctanoyl-SKLS-NH2), the other with a bond analogous to that linking Leu2-Tyr3(5-aminopentanoyl-5-aminopentanoyl-SKLS-NH2). In both cases, introduction of the amide bonds diminished inhibitory potency relative to 11-aminoundecanoyl-SKLS-NH2 (23- and 5-fold respectively; Table IV). These results further emphasize the surprising nature of the finding that this peptideN-myristoyltransferase seems to “prefer” competitive peptidomimetic inhibitors that lack peptide bonds. As with ALYASKLS-NH2 and 5-aminopentanoyl-YASKLS-NH2, deletion of the C-terminal Ser from 11-aminoundecanoyl-SKLS-NH2 produces only a minimal (<3-fold) effect on its inhibitory activity while deletion of its C-terminal Leu-Ser dipeptide (11-aminoundecanoyl-SK-NH2) results in a more substantial (30-fold) reduction in potency. 11-Aminoundecanoyl-SK-NH2 represents a dipeptide inhibitor (IC50 = 14.5 ± 1.6 μm) that is competitive for peptide (K i = 11.7 ± 0.4 μm; Fig. 1 C). The K i of this compound is equivalent to the K i of the starting octapeptide inhibitor, ALYASKLS-NH2 (15.3 ± 6.4 μm). The contributions of the remaining amino acids in 11-aminoundecanoyl-SK-NH2 to recognition were explored. Presentation of the hydroxyl group is important: extension of this OH in the context of homoserine, cis-4-hydroxyproline, or tyrosine worsens inhibitory potency by 3–70-fold (Table IV). The stereochemistry of the Lys side chain is also critical: substitutingd-Lys abolishes inhibitory activity (Table IV). Deletion of the ε-amino group (Nle) or masking its charge (ε-N-acetyl-lysine) produces more modest attenuation (4–7-fold). In the context of this dipeptide aminoalkyl inhibitor,l-His can substitute for l-Lys, producing an inhibitor competitive for peptide with similar potency (K i = 11.9 ± 1.0 versus 11.7 ± 0.4 μm). Again stereochemistry is important:d-His is inactive (IC50 > 1000 μm). Masking either of the imidazole nitrogens (1-methyl-histidine or 3-methyl-hisitidine) also eliminates inhibitory activity (IC50 > 1000 μm).p-Aminophenylalanine contains a terminal basic amine: the length of the side chain is similar to Lys, although the bulk is greater and the pK a of the amine is lower (∼10versus ∼5). It cannot substitute for Lys (IC50> 1000 μm; Table IV). Our findings indicate that an 11-aminoundecanoyl backbone can serve to maintain an appropriate distance between three elements critical for recognition by the peptide-binding site in the fungal Nmt·myristoyl-CoA binary complex. These elements include a simple ω-terminal amino group, a β-hydroxyl, and an ε-amino group or an imidazole. Each of these competitive inhibitors has one peptide bond and two chiral centers. They are equipotent with the starting peptide inhibitor, ALYASKLS-NH2, which was derived from a known Nmt substrate (Arf) and contained 7 peptide bonds and 8 chiral centers. 11-Aminoundecanoyl-SK-NH2 and 11-aminoundecanoyl-SH-NH2 demonstrate that this fungal Nmt can be inhibited by simplified organic-peptide hybrids and suggests that it may be possible to incorporate these elements of recognition, or functionally equivalent mimics, in a fully de-peptidized organic molecule.

This represents the first experimental evidence for RNA priming and DNA extension as the mechanism of mammalian telomeric lagging strand replication. Semiconservative discontinuous bidirectional DNA replication presents the “end problem” for replication of linear genomes (1Watson J.D. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 239: 197-201Google Scholar). Mammalian chromosomes contain short repeated DNA sequences complexed with specific proteins at each termini (telomeres) and, in conjunction with telomerase, can circumvent this problem. Telomerase has been extensively studied and catalyzes the 5′ to 3′ extension of the terminal 3′-OH using an internal ribonucleotide template (reviewed in Ref. 2Blackburn E.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 113-129Google Scholar). To completely replicate telomeres, the strand complementary to the telomeric leading strand must be synthesized to generate a double strand DNA product.The mechanism by which the DNA strand complementary to the telomerase catalyzed leading strand is synthesized has not been addressed experimentally. Two models have been proposed for synthesis of the telomere lagging strand. The first involves RNA priming and DNA extension followed by removal of RNA primers and ligation of the Okazaki-like fragments (3Zahler A.M. Prescott D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6299-6317Google Scholar, 4Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1985; 43: 405-413Google Scholar), presumably using the same enzymatic machinery employed for lagging strand synthesis at a replication fork (5Waga S. Bauer G. Stillman B. J. Biol.

The alternative hypothesis is based upon in vitroanalyses of telomeric DNA sequences and the propensity to form higher ordered structures (7Balagurumoorthy P. Brahmachari S.K. J. Biol.

The structure generated must present a 3′-hydroxyl for DNA polymerase (pol) 1The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; FEN-1, flap endonuclease-1. 1The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; FEN-1, flap endonuclease-1.catalyzed extension for synthesis of the lagging strand followed by a nucleolytic processing reaction to generate a terminal 3′-hydroxyl to enable telomerase extension in the next round of replication. Experimental evidence for either of these hypotheses or other alternative mechanisms has not been obtained. The goal of this study was to identify proteins in mammalian whole cell extracts and determine the mechanism for copying a synthetic mammalian telomeric substrate.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESUnlabeled nucleotides were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and radiolabeled nucleotides were from DuPont NEN. HeLa whole cell extracts were prepared essentially according to Wood et al. (8Wood R.D. Robins P. Lindahl T. Cell. 1988; 53: 97-106Google Scholar). Calf thymus DNA pol α/primase was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography according to Nasheuer and Grosse (9Nasheuer H.P. Grosse F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8458-8466Google Scholar). Calf thymus RNase HI was generously provided by R. Bambara (University of Rochester). Calf DNA ligase I and FEN-1 were purified as described previously (10Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15136-15141Google Scholar). The TS10, consisting of 10 repeats of the sequence d(TTAGGG) was synthesized on a Molecular Biosystems 390 DNA synthesizer and purified by 15% polyacrylamide/7 m urea preparative DNA sequencing gel electrophoresis (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Lagging strand synthesis reactions were performed in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 7.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmeach dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, and [α-32P]dCTP (1 μCi, 10 μm). Reactions were supplemented with 5 pmol of TS10 telomere substrate, 1 mm rNTPs, and protein as indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of EDTA to 0.1 m, NaOAc to 0.3m, 1 μg of glycogen, and 100 μl of absolute ethanol. Reaction products were collected by sedimentation at 12,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C and dissolved in 10 μl of 50% formamide, 0.1 m EDTA, 0.01% each of bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanole. Products were separated by electrophoresis through 15% polyacrylamide/7 m urea DNA sequencing gels. Gels were dried, and products were visualized by autoradiography.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have initiated the study of how mammalian cells complete replication of linear chromosomes using an in vitroapproach. A synthetic single-stranded DNA substrate, TS10, was constructed consisting of 10 repeats of the human telomeric DNA sequence d(TTAGGG). The TS10 DNA substrate was incubated with crude cell extracts prepared from exponentially growing HeLa cells. HeLa cells have been demonstrated to contain active telomerase and have stable telomere lengths (12Morin G.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 521-529Google Scholar). Therefore, these cells were used to identify proteins that are capable of copying the telomere leading strand template. Synthesis of the complementary strand requires only dATP, dTTP, and dCTP; therefore we employed conditions to measure the incorporation of [α-32P]dCTP into DNA, dependent upon the input DNA template. Whole cell extracts often contain some endogenous DNA that can serve as a template or primer for DNA synthesis. Therefore, reactions were performed in the presence and the absence of added TS10 substrate to identify products generated that are solely dependent on the input DNA. The results shown in Fig.1 demonstrate that in the absence of added TS10 substrate, a product of approximately 22 bases is observed (lane 1). In the presence of the telomere DNA but without the addition of rNTPs, the 22-base product is also observed with no other products identified (lane 2). The product migrating at 22 bases was not susceptible to degradation by DNase or RNase. However, the majority of the product could be removed by protease degradation and phenol extraction prior to electrophoresis. Incorporation of the dCTP label into products other than the 22-base telomere-independent product was observed in reactions containing rNTPs and the TS10 substrate (lane 3). Products were observed at one-base intervals ranging from 5 to 30 nucleotides in length in addition to minor products at 35, 42, 48, and 55 bases. The dependence on rNTPs strongly suggests that an RNA priming event is required for DNA extension. No products were observed greater than 60 bases in length, indicating that the TS10 substrate itself was not being extended via formation of a hairpin secondary structure. To identify the proteins responsible for the synthesis of the telomeric lagging strand, we employed the monoclonal antibody SJK 132-20, which inhibits DNA pol α and shows no cross-reactivity with DNA pols δ and ε (13Syväoja J. Suomensaari S. Nishida C. Goldsmith J.S. Chui G.S. Jain S. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6664-6668Google Scholar). Preincubation of the cell extract with the inhibitory antibody abrogated the telomere DNA-dependent DNA synthetic activity (lane 4), demonstrating that DNA pol α is responsible for generating the telomeric lagging strand products.Because the synthetic activity associated with the telomeric template was dependent on DNA pol α and rNTPs, an RNA priming mechanism was likely. DNA pol α has a tightly associated primase activity capable of de novo RNA priming (reviewed in Ref. 14Kaguni L.S. Lehman I.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 87-101Google Scholar). Therefore, we purified DNA pol α/primase from calf thymus by immunoaffinity chromatography (9Nasheuer H.P. Grosse F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8458-8466Google Scholar). The purified DNA pol α/primase was then assayed for the ability to perform lagging strand synthesis on the TS10 substrate. The results shown in Fig. 2 Ademonstrate that in a complete reaction containing TS10, rNTPs, and dNTPs, increasing concentrations of calf DNA pol α/primase were able to catalyze the synthesis of DNA using the telomeric DNA as a template. Quantification of these results demonstrate a linear increase in incorporation. The results presented in Fig. 2 B demonstrate that DNA pol α/primase requires rNTPs and TS10 to generate DNA synthetic products (lane 1), because reactions performed without rNTPs (lane 2) or without TS10 (lane 3) show no synthesis. The products observed from DNA in the reaction with purified DNA pol α/primase synthesis occur in groups of three bases. These products are likely the first, second, and third dCMP label being incorporated. The low concentration of dCTP employed is necessary to achieve the specific activity required to efficiently detect synthesis and likely results in dissociation or pausing of DNA pol α/primase as a result of low dNTP concentration and an inherent low processivity of DNA pol α (15Hohn K.T. Grosse F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2870-2878Google Scholar). The products are also observed at six-base intervals centered approximately at 16, 22, 28, and 34 bases, a similar length distribution to that observed in the cell extract (Fig. 1). This pattern suggests a unique primer initiation site and DNA synthesis termination site. The site-specific termination or pausing is likely in the run of three guanosine bases in the template strand, as discussed earlier. In addition, DNA synthetic products generated by calf DNA pol α/primase on the TS10 substrate could be extended further by the addition of the large fragment of Escherichia coli DNA pol I (data not shown). This result provides evidence that termination or pausing observed is not the result of complete synthesis over the entire template. The difference in small products observed in the cell extract compared with the purified DNA pol α is likely the result of contaminating nucleases present in the extract.Figure 2Synthesis of the telomere lagging strand by purified calf thymus DNA pol α/primase. A, all reactions contained dATP, dGTP, dTTP, [α-32P]dCTP, rNTPs, and the TS10 substrate (lane 1). Immunoaffinity purified calf DNA pol α (0.004 units, lane 2; 0.008 units, lane 3; and 0.016 units, lane 4) was titrated into the reactions and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Reactions were processed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The position of molecular weight markers is shown on the left axis.B, sensitivity of mammalian telomeric lagging strand synthesis to ribonucleotides, template, and pol antibody. All reactions contained 0.018 units of calf DNA pol α/primase, dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and [α-32P]dCTP. Reactions were supplemented with rNTPs and TS10 substrate (lane 1); TS10 substrate without rNTPs (lane 2); rNTPs without the TS10 substrate (lane 3); rNTPs and TS10 substrate, except DNA pol α/primase, was preincubated with antibody SJK 132-20 (0.5 μg) on ice for 30 min prior to initiating the reaction (lane 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Removal of RNA primers from lagging strand Okazaki fragments is necessary for complete processing and ligation. The eukaryotic pathway for removal of RNA primers requires both RNase HI and FEN-1 (5Waga S. Bauer G. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10923-10934Google Scholar, 6Turchi J.J. Huang L. Murante R.S. Kim Y. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9803-9807Google Scholar). Therefore, we employed purified calf RNase HI in complete lagging strand synthetic reactions. The results shown in Fig. 3demonstrate an increased mobility of products (lanes 2–4) compared with reactions performed without RNase HI (lane 1). The decrease in intensity of products observed at 26, 32, and 38 bases is accompanied by an increase in products at intermediate positions and low molecular weight. These results demonstrate that the RNA primers are at least partially processed by RNase HI. Complete processing requires FEN-1 and DNA ligase I in addition to RNase HI (5Waga S. Bauer G. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10923-10934Google Scholar, 6Turchi J.J. Huang L. Murante R.S. Kim Y. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9803-9807Google Scholar). Reactions were performed with each of these components, and the results are also shown in Fig. 3. The addition of RNase HI and FEN-1 results in a further increase in mobility (lane 6) compared with reactions performed without RNase H. These results are consistent with the role of FEN-1 in removing the last ribonucleotide from an Okazaki fragment (6Turchi J.J. Huang L. Murante R.S. Kim Y. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9803-9807Google Scholar, 10Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15136-15141Google Scholar). The addition of DNA ligase I to the reactions had essentially no effect (lane 7). The inability to observe ligation products likely results from not having multiple priming events on a single template. Each reaction contains 5 pmol of TS10 substrate, and we estimate that less than 5% of the substrates are utilized during the course of the reaction, thereby decreasing the likelihood of a single DNA molecule sustaining two priming events. Although RNase HI can degrade RNA primers from RNA-DNA hybrids, RNase H from Drosophila melanogaster alters its cognate DNA pol α/primase activity increasing primer synthesis (16DiFrancesco R.A. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14764-14770Google Scholar). A similar interaction has also been observed with RNase H and DNA pol α from calf (17Hagemeier A. Grosse F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 621-628Google Scholar). Interestingly, using calf thymus RNase HI purified by a different method (18Eder P.S. Walder J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6472-6479Google Scholar), we have observed the stimulation of DNA pol α/primase (data not shown). The relationship between these two forms of RNase H and their interaction with DNA pol α is currently under investigation.Figure 3Initiator RNA primer removal from lagging strand products. A, all reactions contained dATP, dGTP, dTTP, [α-32P]dCTP, rNTPs, 0.018 units of DNA pol α/primase, and TS10 substrate. Reactions contained no additons (lanes 1 and 5); purified RNase HI (1.2 ng,lane 2; 2.4 ng, lane 3; 4.8 ng, lane 4); 2.4 ng of RNase HI and 3.7 ng of FEN-1 (lane 6); or 2.4 ng of RNase HI, 3.7 ng of FEN-1, and 0.5 μg of DNA ligase 1 (lane 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The specific banding pattern observed in telomere lagging strand reactions suggests that primer initiation may be at a unique site on the telomeric DNA template. Previous studies have shown that DNA pol α/primase initiates primer synthesis by creating a dinucleotide complex with a single-stranded template (19Sheaff R.J. Kuchta R.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3027-3037Google Scholar). DNA pol α/primase acts by first adding the eventual second nucleotide of the RNA sequence, preferring this nucleotide to be a purine. More recently, a preferential priming sequence 5′-d(GCTTTCTTCC) has been deducedin vitro (20Harrington C. Perrino F.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1003-1009Google Scholar). In vivo experiments mapping replication initiation sites identified a similar sequence that serves as a preferential priming site (21Waltz S.E. Trivedi A.A. Leffak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1887-1894Google Scholar). The telomeric d(TTAGGG) repeat contains only two pyrimidines, and if sequence-specific initiation is occurring, it is likely to be opposite the two thymidine bases. To test this hypothesis, we performed an experiment varying the rNTPs added to the lagging strand reactions. The results are shown in Fig.4 and demonstrate that DNA pol α/primase catalyzed priming and extension in reactions containing all four rNTPs (lane 1). In addition, reactions performed with only rATP, rCTP, and rUTP (lane 2) and rATP and rCTP (lane 5) resulted in a similar distribution of products and rate of incorporation to that observed with the full complement of rNTPs (lane 1). The synthetic activity observed in reactions performed with only rATP and rCTP (lane 5) was 50% greater than that observed in reactions performed with the full complement of rNTPs (lane 1). Interestingly, all reactions containing rCTP (lanes 3 and 6) supported approximately 10–20% of primer synthesis and extension compared with reactions performed with all four rNTPs. CTP also alone resulted in this low level of priming and extension (data not shown) and is likely the result of a minor rATP contamination in the rCTP preparation because the product distribution is unchanged. The maximum length of primers that can be synthesized with rCTP and rATP is five nucleotides and corresponds to primers having the sequence 5′-AACCC. This is significant because previous studies have demonstrated that elongation of RNA primers by DNA pol α/primase requires a minimal length of seven to ten nucleotides (19Sheaff R.J. Kuchta R.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3027-3037Google Scholar). Our results suggest that in fact DNA pol α can recognize and extend RNA primers as short as five nucleotides. Interestingly, the data presented in Figs. 3 and 4 reveal a distinct product migrating at greater than 60 bases in all lanes. This product is observed independent of rNTPs employed in the reaction and has also been observed in some reactions without the addition of rNTPs. However, this product was also observed in reactions employing a [α-32P]rCTP label, suggesting that it is not a result of DNA extension and labeling of the TS10 substrate via a stable secondary structure (data not shown).Figure 4RNA priming specificity of the telomere lagging strand catalyzed by DNA pol α/primase.

The protein was identified as DNA pol α/primase by antibody inhibition experiments. Characterization of telomeric lagging strand synthesis demonstrated complete dependence on rNTPs, suggesting an RNA priming mechanism. Direct evidence of RNA priming of the TS10 substrate was obtained using a [α-32P]rCTP label (data not shown). A unique primer initiation site was established, and five-base-long ribonucleotide primers are capable of being extended with DNA by pol α. Degradation of the RNA primers was accomplished by RNase HI and FEN-1 consistent with their role in Okazaki fragment processing.The results presented suggest that DNA pol α/primase has a role in telomere maintenance. In a genetic screen to identify proteins that interact with the yeast PRI1 gene, encoding the DNA primase subunit of pol α/primase, the MEC3 was isolated (22Longhese M.P. Fraschini R. Plevani P.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3235-3244Google Scholar).MEC3 has been found to participate in the G2cell cycle checkpoint and, in conjunction with RAD24 andRAD17, degrade the C-rich strand of telomeric and subtelomeric DNA in response to DNA damage (23Lydall D. Weinert T.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1488-1491Google Scholar). The demonstration thatmec3,pri1 double mutants are synthetically lethal (22Longhese M.P. Fraschini R. Plevani P. Lucchini G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3235-3244Google Scholar) supports our hypothesis that primase is involved in mammalian telomere maintenance. Interestingly, a recent study has identified theSaccharomyces cerevisiae cdc13 gene product as a specific telomere DNA binding protein (24Nugent C.I. Hughes T.R. Lue N.F. Lundblad V. Science. 1996; 274: 249-252Google Scholar). The finding that arrest ofcdc13 mutants requires RAD24 (25Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6136Google Scholar) and thereforeMEC3 provides further evidence that primase is involved in mammalian telomere metabolism. Semiconservative discontinuous bidirectional DNA replication presents the “end problem” for replication of linear genomes (1Watson J.D. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 239: 197-201Google Scholar). Mammalian chromosomes contain short repeated DNA sequences complexed with specific proteins at each termini (telomeres) and, in conjunction with telomerase, can circumvent this problem. Telomerase has been extensively studied and catalyzes the 5′ to 3′ extension of the terminal 3′-OH using an internal ribonucleotide template (reviewed in Ref. 2Blackburn E.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 113-129Google Scholar). To completely replicate telomeres, the strand complementary to the telomeric leading strand must be synthesized to generate a double strand DNA product. The mechanism by which the DNA strand complementary to the telomerase catalyzed leading strand is synthesized has not been addressed experimentally. Two models have been proposed for synthesis of the telomere lagging strand. The first involves RNA priming and DNA extension followed by removal of RNA primers and ligation of the Okazaki-like fragments (3Zahler A.M. Prescott D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6299-6317Google Scholar, 4Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1985; 43: 405-413Google Scholar), presumably using the same enzymatic machinery employed for lagging strand synthesis at a replication fork (5Waga S. Bauer G. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10923-10934Google Scholar, 6Turchi J.J. Huang L. Murante R.S. Kim Y. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9803-9807Google Scholar). The alternative hypothesis is based upon in vitroanalyses of telomeric DNA sequences and the propensity to form higher ordered structures (7Balagurumoorthy P. Brahmachari S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21858-21869Google Scholar). The structure generated must present a 3′-hydroxyl for DNA polymerase (pol) 1The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; FEN-1, flap endonuclease-1. 1The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; FEN-1, flap endonuclease-1.catalyzed extension for synthesis of the lagging strand followed by a nucleolytic processing reaction to generate a terminal 3′-hydroxyl to enable telomerase extension in the next round of replication. Experimental evidence for either of these hypotheses or other alternative mechanisms has not been obtained. The goal of this study was to identify proteins in mammalian whole cell extracts and determine the mechanism for copying a synthetic mammalian telomeric substrate.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have initiated the study of how mammalian cells complete replication of linear chromosomes using an in vitroapproach. A synthetic single-stranded DNA substrate, TS10, was constructed consisting of 10 repeats of the human telomeric DNA sequence d(TTAGGG). The TS10 DNA substrate was incubated with crude cell extracts prepared from exponentially growing HeLa cells. HeLa cells have been demonstrated to contain active telomerase and have stable telomere lengths (12Mor"

We describe the specific binding of the benzodiazepine agonist flunitrazepam to α6β2γ2-containing GABAA receptors, which has not been observed before and differs from previous reports. With the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique, we observed a functional discrimination between α1β2γ2- and α6β2γ2-receptors. Different benzodiazepines had different effects on GABA-evoked chloride currents. The agonist flunitrazepam had an inverse agonistic effect, whereas the antagonist flumazenil increased GABA-induced chloride currents. The action of flunitrazepam on the channel activity of α6β2γ2-receptors was opposite to its action on α1β2γ2-receptors. We conclude that flunitrazepam can act as either an agonist or an inverse agonist, depending on the GABAA receptor configuration. γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor subtypes containing the α6-subunit are generally thought to be insensitive to the action of benzodiazepine agonists.

Benzodiazepines (BZs) 1The abbreviations used are: BZs, benzodiazepines; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid type A. 1The abbreviations used are: BZs, benzodiazepines; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid type A. act via the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor, thereby influencing the chloride influx into the cell (1Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Google Scholar, 2Lüddens H. Korpi E.R. J. Psychiatr. Res. 1995; 29: 77-94Google Scholar). Studies of a variety of GABAA receptor compositions have led to the conclusion that ternary receptors reconstituted from α-, β-, and γ-subunits have binding sites for BZs, with the high-affinity site being located on the α-subunit (3Pritchett D.B. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 1389-1392Google Scholar, 4Ymer S. Draguhn A. Wisden W. Werner P. Keinänen K. Schofield P.R. Sprengel R. Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3261-3267Google Scholar). These subunits are differentially distributed throughout the central nervous system (5Wisden W. Laurie D.J. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1040-1062Google Scholar,6Laurie D.J. Seeburg P.H. Wisden W. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1063-1076Google Scholar). It is generally thought that the subunit composition of the GABAA receptor complex organizes the receptor's pharmacology. The best known concept is that the α1βx γ2-receptors, called type I BZ receptors, preferentially bind full BZ agonists with high affinity (3Pritchett D.B. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 1389-1392Google Scholar) and that the α2/3/5βx γ2-receptors, classified as type II BZ receptors, have a 10-fold lower affinity for BZ agonists (7Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1802-1804Google Scholar, 8Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1421-1425Google Scholar, 9Sieghart W. Schlerka W. Eur. J.

The view is widely held that α6- and α4-containing receptors have virtually no affinity for full BZ agonists (11Lüddens H. Pritchett D.B. Köhler M. Killisch I. Keinänen K. Monyer H. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1990; 346: 648-651Google Scholar, 12Wisden W. Herb A. Wieland H. Keinänen K. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 227-230Google Scholar, 13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar), although they retain a high affinity for the partial inverse BZ agonist Ro 15-4513 (14Suzdak P.D. Glowa J.R. Crawley J.N. Schwartz R. Skolnick P. Paul S.M.A. Science. 1986; 234: 1243-1247Google Scholar, 15Turner D.M. Sapp D.W. Olsen R.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 257: 1236-1242Google Scholar). In the mature mammalian brain, the α6-subunit is expressed exclusively in the cerebellum (6Laurie D.J. Seeburg P.H. Wisden W. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1063-1076Google Scholar), where it is preferentially found in granular cells (16Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Stephenson F.A. Somogyi P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 103-114Google Scholar).The studies we report here focus on the BZ pharmacology of the α6β2γ2-receptor. We show that α6β2γ2-GABAAreceptors have high affinity for the BZ agonist flunitrazepam, although the histidine at position 100 in the ligand-binding domain, which is thought to be crucial for BZ binding, is missing (13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar). Furthermore, using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique on α6β2γ2-transfected cells, we demonstrate that flunitrazepam has an inverse agonistic effect on GABA-induced chloride currents, whereas the BZ antagonist Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) increases GABA-mediated chloride currents.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONClassical BZ agonists are generally thought to bind to all ternary GABAA receptor complexes reconstituted from α-, β-, and γ-subunits, except when the α6- or α4-subunit is involved (13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar). This conclusion was drawn indirectly from competition studies with classical BZ agonists as competitors for the inverse agonist-binding site of [3H]Ro 15-4513. A single histidine was found to be essential for prototypic BZ agonist binding (13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar). We analyzed the direct binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to recombinant α1β2γ2- and α6β2γ2-GABAAreceptors. The results for the recombinant α6β2γ2-receptor were unexpected. Scatchard analysis with [3H]flunitrazepam in concentrations between 1.2 and 40 nm revealed a single category of saturable high-affinity binding sites, with aK d value of 8.7 nm for α6β2γ2-receptors compared with a K d value of 3.3 nm for α1β2γ2-receptors (Fig.1, A and B). With this finding for α6β2γ2-receptors, we postulate a binding site for flunitrazepam on this receptor subtype, which has not been detected previously. Whereas α1β2γ2-receptors are found throughout the central nervous system, α6β2γ2-receptors are localized predominantly on cerebellar granule cells in the neighborhood of a variety of excitatory ion channels (12Wisden W. Herb A. Wieland H. Keinänen K. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 227-230Google Scholar, 16Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Stephenson F.A. Somogyi P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 103-114Google Scholar).In competition binding studies, the α1β2γ2-receptors, which are the “classical” GABAA receptors, exhibited the expected displacement of flunitrazepam binding by other BZ agonists (11Lüddens H. Pritchett D.B. Köhler M. Killisch I. Keinänen K. Monyer H. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1990; 346: 648-651Google Scholar), whereas for the α6β2γ2-receptors, we obtainedK i values 150–1000-fold higher than the observedK d (Table I). The weak displacement of flunitrazepam binding by classical BZ agonists suggested that we had found a binding site on the α6β2γ2-receptor with a preference for flunitrazepam. We then looked at whether the peripheral BZ receptor ligand 4′-chlorodiazepam (Ro 5-4864), which interacts with a unique low-affinity site on the GABAA receptor, and a peripheral BZ receptor antagonist, the isoquinoline carboxamide derivative PK 11195 (22Basile A.S. Bolger G.T. Lüddens H.W. Skolnick P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 248: 463-469Google Scholar), bound to the flunitrazepam-binding site. We did not detect any flunitrazepam displacement (Table I). Finally, we examined whether other BZ agonists, such as alprazolam and chlordiazepoxide, or BZ inverse agonists, such as methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-β-carboline 3-carboxylate,n-butyl-β-carboline 3-carboxylate, and desmethyldiazepam, were able to compete for the flunitrazepam-binding site on the α6-subunit, but found only weak displacement or none at all (Table I).Table IBinding affinity of various benzodiazepinesα1β2γ2α6β2γ2K d (nm)aValues represent the mean K d or mean K i ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments done in triplicate.[3H]Flunitrazepam3.3 ± 1.98.7 ± 3.0K i (nm)Diazepam5.5 ± 2.91190 ± 160Clonazepam2.0 ± 0.55000 ± 1900Bromazepam190 ± 708300 ± 2400Lorazepam5.6 ± 1.22900 ± 900Ro 5–4864ND1-bND, not determined; DMCM, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-β-carboline 3-carboxylate; β-CCB,n-butyl-β-carboline 3-carboxylate.>10,000PK 11195ND>10,000DMCM8.6 ± 1.8>10,000β-CCB28.8 ± 3.01580 ± 480Chlordiazepoxide2080 ± 750>10,000Alprazolam23.1 ± 2.5>10,000Desmethyldiazepam159 ± 742130 ± 7001-a Values represent the mean K d or mean K i ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments done in triplicate.1-b ND, not determined; DMCM, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-β-carboline 3-carboxylate; β-CCB,n-butyl-β-carboline 3-carboxylate. Open table in a new tab We also wanted to test whether the Ro 15-4513 binding site on α6β2γ2 receptors had any influence on the newly described flunitrazepam binding site. Analysis of α1(Arg-101)β2γ2 and α6(His-100)β2γ2 receptors along with the wild-type receptors showed that the sensitivity of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to flunitrazepam as well as to diazepam coincided with the presence of the crucial amino acid histidine (Table II). The newly proposed high affinity binding site of flunitrazepam on α6β2γ2 receptors did not compete with the Ro 15-4513 binding site. The BZ antagonist flumazenil exhibited a 100–300-fold lower affinity for mutant receptors and α6β2γ2 receptors than for α1β2γ2 receptors which is in agreement with data previously published (13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab To investigate whether an exchange of the crucial amino acid histidine, responsible for high-affinity BZ agonist binding, would change the flunitrazepam affinity for α6β2γ2-receptors, we used two mutants, already described elsewhere (13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar), for [3H]flunitrazepam binding studies. These mutant receptors, α1(Arg-101)β2γ2and α6(His-100)β2γ2, showed a single class of binding sites, with mean K d values of 19.7 and 5.4 nm, respectively (Fig. 1, A andB). This gives evidence that histidine 100 is not the exclusive determinant of flunitrazepam binding as postulated earlier (13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar).The response to GABA characterized by the electrophysiological investigation of recombinant GABAA receptors is known to be enhanced consistently by flunitrazepam (23Malherbe P. Draguhn A. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Möhler H. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 8: 199-208Google Scholar, 24Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. Kemp J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 240-244Google Scholar), and this effect can be blocked completely by flumazenil (3Pritchett D.B. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 1389-1392Google Scholar, 24Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. Kemp J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 240-244Google Scholar). In the case of the rat α1β2γ2-receptor, 1 μm flunitrazepam has been shown to enhance 1 μm GABA-evoked currents by 64% (25Kleingoor C. Ewert M. von Blankenfeld G. Seeburg P.H. Kettenmann H. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 130: 169-172Google Scholar). We observed that α1β2γ2-receptors reacted as expected to the coapplication of GABA and flunitrazepam. Flunitrazepam (10 μm) markedly affected the amplitude of the peak current at both GABA concentrations used and in a dose-dependent manner. At 1 μm GABA, we detected a 117 ± 46% increase in the amplitude, whereas coapplication with a higher concentration of GABA (10 μm) elicited a smaller potentiation of 46 ± 6% (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Effects of flunitrazepam on recombinant GABAA receptors. Inward currents of HEK 293 cells activated by 1 or 10 μm GABA and measured at −50 mV are shown for α1β2γ2-receptors (A) and α6β2γ2-receptors (B) as a representative experiment of 6–12 independent experiments. Transfected cells were first challenged with GABA for 5 s and again challenged with GABA plus 10 μmflunitrazepam. Black curves (b) are control GABA responses for the situation using either 1 μm GABA (left panels) or 10 μm GABA (right panels) without flunitrazepam. Gray curves(a) are GABA responses in the presence of 10 μm flunitrazepam. Also shown (C) is the effect of 10 μm flunitrazepam on α6β2γ2-receptors at different concentrations of GABA expressed as mean ± S.E. Data are expressed in terms of percent inhibition, which was calculated by the following formula: (1 −I GABA+10 μm flunitrazepam/I GABA) × 100. The asterisks indicate a significant inhibitory effect (t test for paired samples; p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)For α6β2γ2-receptors, however, 10 μm flunitrazepam and 10 μm GABA resulted in a significant reduction of control currents to 76 ± 12%, whereas coapplication of 1 μm GABA and 10 μm flunitrazepam did not produce a significant change in amplitude (Fig. 2, B and C). This effect of flunitrazepam was shown to be dependent on the concentration of GABA and became significant at a concentration of 6 μm GABA (Fig. 2 C). Our data thus indicate that flunitrazepam acts on α6β2γ2-receptors in an inverse agonistic manner.Our investigation of the effects of flumazenil on GABA-evoked chloride currents showed opposite effects for the two receptors studied. For cells expressing α1β2γ2-receptors, 10 μm flumazenil reduced the amplitude of chloride currents induced by application of 10 μm GABA to 89 ± 3% of control, whereas for cells expressing α6β2γ2-receptors, there was an increase to 118 ± 3% of control induced by application of 1 μm GABA and 10 μm flumazenil (Figs.3 (A and B) and 4A). We have used different GABA concentrations depending on the receptor subtype because we found in an earlier investigation (17Hauser C.A.E. Wetzel C.H.R. Rupprecht R. Holsboer F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 531-536Google Scholar) that α6β2γ2-receptors effectively responded to GABA at lower concentrations than α1β2γ2-receptors. The effect of flumazenil on α6β2γ2-receptor-mediated responses is low compared with previous reports on Sf-9 cells and HEK 293 cells (26Im W.B. Im H.K. Pregenzer J.F. Hamilton B.J. Carter D.B. Jacobsen E.J. TenBrink R.E. VonVoigtlander P.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 677-680Google Scholar). In an earlier investigation, an apparent agonistic activity of flumazenil was reported for a binary GABAAreceptor using the rat α1- and β2-subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes (23Malherbe P. Draguhn A. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Möhler H. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 8: 199-208Google Scholar). Here, 10 μmflumazenil potentiated the response induced by 2–10 μmGABA to 175% of control.Figure 3Effects of flumazenil or Ro 15-4513 on recombinant GABAA receptors.

For α6β2γ2-receptors with 1 μm GABA, there was a comparable change in current amplitude, but in the opposite direction (Figs. 3 (A andB) and 4A).In this study, we demonstrate that the two receptor subtypes α1β2γ2 and α6β2γ2 react with the BZ receptor ligands flunitrazepam, flumazenil, and Ro 15-4513 in a functionally opposite manner. The exact mechanism underlying the distinct BZ pharmacology of the α6β2γ2-receptor is not clear at present. Our findings, together with those of earlier investigations (13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar, 26Im W.B. Im H.K. Pregenzer J.F. Hamilton B.J. Carter D.B. Jacobsen E.J. TenBrink R.E. VonVoigtlander P.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 677-680Google Scholar), lead us to conclude that distinct amino acids of the BZ-binding pocket determine the BZ agonistic or inverse agonistic activity of the GABAA receptor subtype. For the wild-type α6β2γ2-receptor, we postulate that after binding of flunitrazepam, the bulky amino acid arginine induces a structural change that modifies the channel in a way that decreases chloride ion flux. If the smaller amino acid histidine (wild-type α1β2γ2-receptor) is present, such a hindrance of influx may be absent. Studies involving site-directed mutagenesis should be conducted to elucidate the molecular characteristics of the flunitrazepam-binding site on the α6β2γ2-receptor. Benzodiazepines (BZs) 1The abbreviations used are: BZs, benzodiazepines; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid type A. 1The abbreviations used are: BZs, benzodiazepines; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid type A. act via the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor, thereby influencing the chloride influx into the cell (1Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Google Scholar, 2Lüddens H. Korpi E.R. J. Psychiatr. Res. 1995; 29: 77-94Google Scholar). Studies of a variety of GABAA receptor compositions have led to the conclusion that ternary receptors reconstituted from α-, β-, and γ-subunits have binding sites for BZs, with the high-affinity site being located on the α-subunit (3Pritchett D.B. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 1389-1392Google Scholar, 4Ymer S. Draguhn A. Wisden W. Werner P. Keinänen K. Schofield P.R. Sprengel R. Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3261-3267Google Scholar). These subunits are differentially distributed throughout the central nervous system (5Wisden W. Laurie D.J. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1040-1062Google Scholar,6Laurie D.J. Seeburg P.H. Wisden W. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1063-1076Google Scholar). It is generally thought that the subunit composition of the GABAA receptor complex organizes the receptor's pharmacology. The best known concept is that the α1βx γ2-receptors, called type I BZ receptors, preferentially bind full BZ agonists with high affinity (3Pritchett D.B. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 1389-1392Google Scholar) and that the α2/3/5βx γ2-receptors, classified as type II BZ receptors, have a 10-fold lower affinity for BZ agonists (7Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1802-1804Google Scholar, 8Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1421-1425Google Scholar, 9Sieghart W. Schlerka W. Eur. J.

The view is widely held that α6- and α4-containing receptors have virtually no affinity for full BZ agonists (11Lüddens H. Pritchett D.B. Köhler M. Killisch I. Keinänen K. Monyer H. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1990; 346: 648-651Google Scholar, 12Wisden W. Herb A. Wieland H. Keinänen K. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 227-230Google Scholar, 13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar), although they retain a high affinity for the partial inverse BZ agonist Ro 15-4513 (14Suzdak P.D. Glowa J.R. Crawley J.N. Schwartz R. Skolnick P. Paul S.M.A. Science. 1986; 234: 1243-1247Google Scholar, 15Turner D.M. Sapp D.W. Olsen R.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 257: 1236-1242Google Scholar). In the mature mammalian brain, the α6-subunit is expressed exclusively in the cerebellum (6Laurie D.J. Seeburg P.H. Wisden W. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1063-1076Google Scholar), where it is preferentially found in granular cells (16Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Stephenson F.A. Somogyi P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 103-114Google Scholar). The studies we report here focus on the BZ pharmacology of the α6β2γ2-receptor. We show that α6β2γ2-GABAAreceptors have high affinity for the BZ agonist flunitrazepam, although the histidine at position 100 in the ligand-binding domain, which is thought to be crucial for BZ binding, is missing (13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar). Furthermore, using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique on α6β2γ2-transfected cells, we demonstrate that flunitrazepam has an inverse agonistic effect on GABA-induced chloride currents, whereas the BZ antagonist Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) increases GABA-mediated chloride currents. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONClassical BZ agonists are generally thought to bind to all ternary GABAA receptor complexes reconstituted from α-, β-, and γ-subunits, except when the α6- or α4-subunit is involved (13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar). This conclusion was drawn indirectly from competition studies with classical BZ agonists as competitors for the inverse agonist-binding site of [3H]Ro 15-4513. A single histidine was found to be essential for prototypic BZ agonist binding (13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar). We analyzed the direct binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to recombinant α1β2γ2- and α6β2γ2-GABAAreceptors. The results for the recombinant α6β2γ2-receptor were unexpected. Scatchard analysis with [3H]flunitrazepam in concentrations between 1.2 and 40 nm revealed a single category of saturable high-affinity binding sites, with aK d value of 8.7 nm for α6β2γ2-receptors compared with a K d value of 3.3 nm for α1β2γ2-receptors (Fig.1, A and B). With this finding for α6β2γ2-receptors, we postulate a binding site for flunitrazepam on this receptor subtype, which has not been detected previously. Whereas α1β2γ2-receptors are found throughout the central nervous system, α6β2γ2-receptors are localized predominantly on cerebellar granule cells in the neighborhood of a variety of excitatory ion channels (12Wisden W. Herb A. Wieland H. Keinänen K. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 227-230Google Scholar, 16Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Stephenson F.A. Somogyi P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 103-114Google Scholar).In competition binding studies, the α1β2γ2-receptors, which are the “classical” GABAA receptors, exhibited the expected displacement of flunitrazepam binding by other BZ agonists (11Lüddens H. Pritchett D.B. Köhler M. Killisch I. Keinänen K. Monyer H. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1990; 346: 648-651Google Scholar), whereas for the α6β2γ2-receptors, we obtainedK i values 150–1000-fold higher than the observedK d (Table I). The weak displacement of flunitrazepam binding by classical BZ agonists suggested that we had found a binding site on the α6β2γ2-receptor with a preference for flunitrazepam. We then looked at whether the peripheral BZ receptor ligand 4′-chlorodiazepam (Ro 5-4864), which interacts with a unique low-affinity site on the GABAA receptor, and a peripheral BZ receptor antagonist, the isoquinoline carboxamide derivative PK 11195 (22Basile A.S. Bolger G.T. Lüddens H.W. Skolnick P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 248: 463-469Google Scholar), bound to the flunitrazepam-binding site. We did not detect any flunitrazepam displacement (Table I). Finally, we examined whether other BZ agonists, such as alprazolam and chlordiazepoxide, or BZ inverse agonists, such as methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-β-carboline 3-carboxylate,n-butyl-β-carboline 3-carboxylate, and desmethyldiazepam, were able to compete for the flunitrazepam-binding site on the α6-subunit, but found only weak displacement or none at all (Table I).Table IBinding affinity of various benzodiazepinesα1β2γ2α6β2γ2K d (nm)aValues represent the mean K d or mean K i ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments done in triplicate.[3H]Flunitrazepam3.3 ± 1.98.7 ± 3.0K i (nm)Diazepam5.5 ± 2.91190 ± 160Clonazepam2.0 ± 0.55000 ± 1900Bromazepam190 ± 708300 ± 2400Lorazepam5.6 ± 1.22900 ± 900Ro 5–4864ND1-bND, not determined; DMCM, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-β-carboline 3-carboxylate; β-CCB,n-butyl-β-carboline 3-carboxylate.>10,000PK 11195ND>10,000DMCM8.6 ± 1.8>10,000β-CCB28.8 ± 3.01580 ± 480Chlordiazepoxide2080 ± 750>10,000Alprazolam23.1 ± 2.5>10,000Desmethyldiazepam159 ± 742130 ± 7001-a Values represent the mean K d or mean K i ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments done in triplicate.1-b ND, not determined; DMCM, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-β-carboline 3-carboxylate; β-CCB,n-butyl-β-carboline 3-carboxylate. Open table in a new tab We also wanted to test whether the Ro 15-4513 binding site on α6β2γ2 receptors had any influence on the newly described flunitrazepam binding site. Analysis of α1(Arg-101)β2γ2 and α6(His-100)β2γ2 receptors along with the wild-type receptors showed that the sensitivity of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to flunitrazepam as well as to diazepam coincided with the presence of the crucial amino acid histidine (Table II). The newly proposed high affinity binding site of flunitrazepam on α6β2γ2 receptors did not compete with the Ro 15-4513 binding site. The BZ antagonist flumazenil exhibited a 100–300-fold lower affinity for mutant receptors and α6β2γ2 receptors than for α1β2γ2 receptors which is in agreement with data previously published (13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab To investigate whether an exchange of the crucial amino acid histidine, responsible for high-affinity BZ agonist binding, would change the flunitrazepam affinity for α6β2γ2-receptors, we used two mutants, already described elsewhere (13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar), for [3H]flunitrazepam binding studies. These mutant receptors, α1(Arg-101)β2γ2and α6(His-100)β2γ2, showed a single class of binding sites, with mean K d values of 19.7 and 5.4 nm, respectively (Fig. 1, A andB). This gives evidence that histidine 100 is not the exclusive determinant of flunitrazepam binding as postulated earlier (13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar).The response to GABA characterized by the electrophysiological investigation of recombinant GABAA receptors is known to be enhanced consistently by flunitrazepam (23Malherbe P. Draguhn A. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Möhler H. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 8: 199-208Google Scholar, 24Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. Kemp J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 240-244Google Scholar), and this effect can be blocked completely by flumazenil (3Pritchett D.B. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 1389-1392Google Scholar, 24Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. Kemp J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 240-244Google Scholar). In the case of the rat α1β2γ2-receptor, 1 μm flunitrazepam has been shown to enhance 1 μm GABA-evoked currents by 64% (25Kleingoor C. Ewert M. von Blankenfeld G. Seeburg P.H. Kettenmann H. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 130: 169-172Google Scholar). We observed that α1β2γ2-receptors reacted as expected to the coapplication of GABA and flunitrazepam. Flunitrazepam (10 μm) markedly affected the amplitude of the peak current at both GABA concentrations used and in a dose-dependent manner. At 1 μm GABA, we detected a 117 ± 46% increase in the amplitude, whereas coapplication with a higher concentration of GABA (10 μm) elicited a smaller potentiation of 46 ± 6% (Fig. 2 A).For α6β2γ2-receptors, however, 10 μm flunitrazepam and 10 μm GABA resulted in a significant reduction of control currents to 76 ± 12%, whereas coapplication of 1 μm GABA and 10 μm flunitrazepam did not produce a significant change in amplitude (Fig. 2, B and C). This effect of flunitrazepam was shown to be dependent on the concentration of GABA and became significant at a concentration of 6 μm GABA (Fig. 2 C). Our data thus indicate that flunitrazepam acts on α6β2γ2-receptors in an inverse agonistic manner.Our investigation of the effects of flumazenil on GABA-evoked chloride currents showed opposite effects for the two receptors studied. For cells expressing α1β2γ2-receptors, 10 μm flumazenil reduced the amplitude of chloride currents induced by application of 10 μm GABA to 89 ± 3% of control, whereas for cells expressing α6β2γ2-receptors, there was an increase to 118 ± 3% of control induced by application of 1 μm GABA and 10 μm flumazenil (Figs.3 (A and B) and 4A). We have used different GABA concentrations depending on the receptor subtype because we found in an earlier investigation (17Hauser C.A.E. Wetzel C.H.R. Rupprecht R. Holsboer F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 531-536Google Scholar) that α6β2γ2-receptors effectively responded to GABA at lower concentrations than α1β2γ2-receptors. The effect of flumazenil on α6β2γ2-receptor-mediated responses is low compared with previous reports on Sf-9 cells and HEK 293 cells (26Im W.B. Im H.K. Pregenzer J.F. Hamilton B.J. Carter D.B. Jacobsen E.J. TenBrink R.E. VonVoigtlander P.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 677-680Google Scholar). In an earlier investigation, an apparent agonistic activity of flumazenil was reported for a binary GABAAreceptor using the rat α1- and β2-subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes (23Malherbe P. Draguhn A. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Möhler H. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 8: 199-208Google Scholar). Here, 10 μmflumazenil potentiated the response induced by 2–10 μmGABA to 175% of control.Figure 3Effects of flumazenil or Ro 15-4513 on recombinant GABAA receptors.

Finally, we examined whether other BZ agonists, such as alprazolam and chlordiazepoxide, or BZ inverse agonists, such as methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-β-carboline 3-carboxylate,n-butyl-β-carboline 3-carboxylate, and desmethyldiazepam, were able to compete for the flunitrazepam-binding site on the α6-subunit, but found only weak displacement or none at all (Table I). We also wanted to test whether the Ro 15-4513 binding site on α6β2γ2 receptors had any influence on the newly described flunitrazepam binding site. Analysis of α1(Arg-101)β2γ2 and α6(His-100)β2γ2 receptors along with the wild-type receptors showed that the sensitivity of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to flunitrazepam as well as to diazepam coincided with the presence of the crucial amino acid histidine (Table II). The newly proposed high affinity binding site of flunitrazepam on α6β2γ2 receptors did not compete with the Ro 15-4513 binding site. The BZ antagonist flumazenil exhibited a 100–300-fold lower affinity for mutant receptors and α6β2γ2 receptors than for α1β2γ2 receptors which is in agreement with data previously published (13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar). To investigate whether an exchange of the crucial amino acid histidine, responsible for high-affinity BZ agonist binding, would change the flunitrazepam affinity for α6β2γ2-receptors, we used two mutants, already described elsewhere (13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar), for [3H]flunitrazepam binding studies. These mutant receptors, α1(Arg-101)β2γ2and α6(His-100)β2γ2, showed a single class of binding sites, with mean K d values of 19.7 and 5.4 nm, respectively (Fig. 1, A andB). This gives evidence that histidine 100 is not the exclusive determinant of flunitrazepam binding as postulated earlier (13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar). The response to GABA characterized by the electrophysiological investigation of recombinant GABAA receptors is known to be enhanced consistently by flunitrazepam (23Malherbe P. Draguhn A. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Möhler H. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 8: 199-208Google Scholar, 24Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. Kemp J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 240-244Google Scholar), and this effect can be blocked completely by flumazenil (3Pritchett D.B. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 1389-1392Google Scholar, 24Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. Kemp J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 240-244Google Scholar). In the case of the rat α1β2γ2-receptor, 1 μm flunitrazepam has been shown to enhance 1 μm GABA-evoked currents by 64% (25Kleingoor C. Ewert M. von Blankenfeld G. Seeburg P.H. Kettenmann H. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 130: 169-172Google Scholar). We observed that α1β2γ2-receptors reacted as expected to the coapplication of GABA and flunitrazepam. Flunitrazepam (10 μm) markedly affected the amplitude of the peak current at both GABA concentrations used and in a dose-dependent manner. At 1 μm GABA, we detected a 117 ± 46% increase in the amplitude, whereas coapplication with a higher concentration of GABA (10 μm) elicited a smaller potentiation of 46 ± 6% (Fig. 2 A). For α6β2γ2-receptors, however, 10 μm flunitrazepam and 10 μm GABA resulted in a significant reduction of control currents to 76 ± 12%, whereas coapplication of 1 μm GABA and 10 μm flunitrazepam did not produce a significant change in amplitude (Fig. 2, B and C). This effect of flunitrazepam was shown to be dependent on the concentration of GABA and became significant at a concentration of 6 μm GABA (Fig. 2 C). Our data thus indicate that flunitrazepam acts on α6β2γ2-receptors in an inverse agonistic manner. Our investigation of the effects of flumazenil on GABA-evoked chloride currents showed opposite effects for the two receptors studied. For cells expressing α1β2γ2-receptors, 10 μm flumazenil reduced the amplitude of chloride currents induced by application of 10 μm GABA to 89 ± 3% of control, whereas for cells expressing α6β2γ2-receptors, there was an increase to 118 ± 3% of control induced by application of 1 μm GABA and 10 μm flumazenil (Figs.3 (A and B) and 4A). We have used different GABA concentrations depending on the receptor subtype because we found in an earlier investigation (17Hauser C.A.E. Wetzel C.H.R. Rupprecht R. Holsboer F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 531-536Google Scholar) that α6β2γ2-receptors effectively responded to GABA at lower concentrations than α1β2γ2-receptors. The effect of flumazenil on α6β2γ2-receptor-mediated responses is low compared with previous reports on Sf-9 cells and HEK 293 cells (26Im W.B. Im H.K. Pregenzer J.F. Hamilton B.J. Carter D.B. Jacobsen E.J. TenBrink R.E. VonVoigtlander P.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 677-680Google Scholar). In an earlier investigation, an apparent agonistic activity of flumazenil was reported for a binary GABAAreceptor using the rat α1- and β2-subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes (23Malherbe P. Draguhn A. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Möhler H. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 8: 199-208Google Scholar). Here, 10 μmflumazenil potentiated the response induced by 2–10 μmGABA to 175% of control. Coapplication of flunitrazepam and flumazenil to recombinant α1β2γ2- and α6β2γ2-receptors (Fig.4 B) showed that in the case of the α6β2γ2-receptors, the inverse agonistic properties of flunitrazepam were reduced by the agonistic action of flumazenil. As expected, for the α1β2γ2-receptors, the agonistic properties of flunitrazepam were almost completely suppressed by flumazenil. The partial inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 had the opposite effect on GABA-induced currents in α1β2γ2- and α6β2γ2-receptors. In cells expressing α1β2γ2-receptors, 1 μm Ro 15-4513 decreased the amplitude of 10 μm GABA-induced chloride currents. For α6β2γ2-receptors with 1 μm GABA, there was a comparable change in current amplitude, but in the opposite direction (Figs. 3 (A andB) and 4A). In this study, we demonstrate that the two receptor subtypes α1β2γ2 and α6β2γ2 react with the BZ receptor ligands flunitrazepam, flumazenil, and Ro 15-4513 in a functionally opposite manner. The exact mechanism underlying the distinct BZ pharmacology of the α6β2γ2-receptor is not clear at present. Our findings, together with those of earlier investigations (13Wieland H.A. Lüddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Google Scholar, 26Im W.B. Im H.K. Pregenzer J.F. Hamilton B.J. Carter D.B. Jacobsen E.J. TenBrink R.E. VonVoigtlander P.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 677-680Google Scholar), lead us to conclude that distinct amino acids of the BZ-binding pocket determine the BZ agonistic or inverse agonistic activity of the GABAA receptor subtype. For the wild-type α6β2γ2-receptor, we postulate that after binding of flunitrazepam, the bulky amino acid arginine induces a structural change that modifies the channel in a way that decreases chloride ion flux. If the smaller amino acid histidine (wild-type α1β2γ2-receptor) is present, such a hindrance of influx may be absent. Studies involving site-directed mutagenesis should be conducted to elucidate the molecular characteristics of the flunitrazepam-binding site on the α6β2γ2-receptor.
