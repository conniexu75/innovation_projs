https://openalex.org/W2041113419,"Disulfide bonds can be cleaved at an alkaline pH by treating a protein with excess of a reagent disulfide in the presence of catalytic amounts of thiol. The cleavage products are stable and can be isolated; they contain the mixed disulfide between the reagent and the exposed thiol groups of the protein. The extent of cleavage is readily controlled by the pH of the reaction, temperature, and the addition of urea. Disulfide bonds cleaved by the reaction can be re-formed by exposing the mixed disulfide of the protein to catalytic amounts of thiol. Specific side chains can be added on to the thiol groups in native proteins by treatment with a reagent disulfide alone."

The fluorescence efficiencies were highly temperaturedependent, and the compounds were extremely sensitive to light. There were marked discrepancies between the values obtained in this study for quantum yield and fluorescence polarization of pyridoxamine-5-phosphate and the values recently reported by others."
https://openalex.org/W2023724114,6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) subunits have been dissociated and reassociated in vitro. The intermediate PGD of the heterozygous phenotype is reproduced by reassociation in vitro of subunits derived from the two types of PGD from homozygous flies. This result has a bearingon gene action in the diploid organism and on the mechanism of dosage compensation in Drosophila melanogaster.
https://openalex.org/W2145241432,"The total lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in whole homogenates of various human tissues reacts more similarly toward pyruvate and lactate at 25 degrees C than expected from the marked differences in substrate inhibition at this temperature between isolated, purified LDH-1, and LDH-5. At 37 degrees C, LDH-5 closely resembles LDH-1 in extent of inhibition by substrate. These results are incompatible with the theory that differences in degree of isozyme inhibition by substrate have resulted in predominance of LDH-5 in aerobic tissues and predominance of LDH-1 in aerobic tissues."

The protein, which has ribulose-1,5-diphosphate carboxylase activitY, appear to be a cube swth edge of about 120 angstroms. Substrtucture canl be seen in individual particles, conlsistent with a model having 24 subunits, the number prescribed by the available physical and chlemical data."

Protein synthesis was slowed down in the presence of steroids. Addition of steroids to cells that had stopped beating caused the reestablishiment of the beat."

https://openalex.org/W2019916062,"DURING the past few years, several laboratories1–8 have reported that the activities of many of the acid hydrolases of skeletal muscle are greatly increased in wasting diseases from different causes. Although the progressive loss of muscle mass in these conditions is generally attributed primarily to this enhanced activity of the acid hydrolases, there is little direct experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis. Furthermore, other enzymes involved in protein catabolism, such as alkaline protease6 and peptidases9, have been shown to be elevated in dystrophic muscle. The normally low levels of these enzymes in skeletal muscle and the limited knowledge of their substrate specificities have hindered a better understanding of the mechanism of the wasting process."

https://openalex.org/W1965220828,"CYCLOSTOME branchial hearts are known to contain large amounts of endogenous catecholamines1 and to be markedly insensitive to added adrenaline2,3. There is considerable evidence to suggest that the process whereby the sympathomimetic amines normally enhance the force of cardiac contraction involves the transformation of the enzyme phosphorylase from the b to the a form4,5. The lack of sensitivity of cyclostome hearts to added adrenaline or noradrenaline might therefore be due to the endogenous amines having already activated the conversion of the phosphorylase enzyme from the b to the a form so that even in the absence of any added adrenaline or noradrenaline the enzyme phosphorylase would exist mainly in the a form. This possibility was investigated using hearts isolated from freshly decapitated lampreys (Mordacia). After five minutes immersion in aerated (95 per cent O2 + 5 per cent CO2) modified Ringer solution6 at 22° C, under which conditions isolated hearts will beat spontaneously for many hours, the hearts were rapidly frozen and the phosphorylase activity determined as described previously7, using tissue dilutions of 1/150 (w/v) and rabbit liver glycogen (Nutritional Biochem. Lab.) which had been purified as described by Krebs et al.8. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25° C."

This effect was most marked in mice kept at 35,000 ft. for 1 or 14 days."
