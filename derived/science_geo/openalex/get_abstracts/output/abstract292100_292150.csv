https://openalex.org/W2068151576,"The (230)Th ages and (234)U/(238)U ratios were determined for Barbados corals that grew during periods of high sea level within the last 200,000 years. The similarity of the initial (234)U/(238)U ratios of some of the corals to the modern marine value suggests that these samples are pristine and that the marine (234)U/(238)U ratio 83,000 and 200,000 years ago was within 2 per mil of the modern value. The accuracies of the (230)Th ages are evaluated on the basis of the (234)U/(238)U values and a model of the behavior of uranium and thorium isotopes during diagenesis. For the last three interglacial and two intervening interstadial periods, sea level peaked at or after peaks in summer insolation in the Northern Hemisphere. This overall pattern supports the idea that glacial-interglacial cycles are caused by changes in Earth's orbital geometry. The sea-level drop at the end of the penultimate interglacial, the last interglacial, and a subsequent interstadial period lagged behind the decrease in insolation by 5,000 to 10,000 years."

Large-area arrays of parallel wires 200 nanometers in diameter and 50 micrometers long with a packing density of 5 x 10(8) per square centimeter have been fabricated in this way. When charged, the ends of the wires generate strong, short-range electric fields. The nanowire electric fields have been imaged at high spatial resolution with a scanning force microscope."
https://openalex.org/W1987467050,"Fura-2 calcium imaging in the cricket omega neuron revealed increased intracellular free calcium ion concentration in response to simulated cricket calling songs and other sound stimuli. The time course of the increase and decrease in intracellular calcium coincided with the time course of forward masking, a time-dependent modulation of auditory sensitivity. The buffering of calcium transients with high concentrations of a kinetically fast calcium buffer eliminated the post-stimulus hyperpolarization associated with forward masking, whereas the uncaging of calcium inside the neuron produced a hyperpolarization. The results suggest that sound-stimulated intracellular calcium accumulation acts by means of a calcium-activated hyperpolarizing current to produce forward masking. These findings underscore the importance of chemical dynamics in neural computation by demonstrating a behaviorally relevant role of calcium dynamics in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2095034799,"Stabilization against the rupture and breakup of thin, nonwetting liquid films spread on surfaces is generally sought by modification of equilibrium interfacial properties. A mechanism for suppressing rupture in such films that uses surface-attached polymers togetherwithfree chains in the bulk of the film is reported. Films of an oligostyrene liquid, which rupture within several minutes when spread on a silicon wafer, may be stabilized for many months by a polystyrene brush attached to the substrate, together with some free polystyrene in the liquid. The effect may arise from entanglements of the free chains with the immobilized brush."
https://openalex.org/W2052498082,"The recently characterized "" white "" allotropic form of carbon has been produced at high temperature and low pressure during graphite sublimation. Under free-vaporization conditions above approximately 2550 degrees K, the white carbon forms as small transparent crystals on the edges of the basal planes of graphite. The interplanar spacings of this material are identical to those of a carbon form noted in graphitic gneiss from the Ries Crater."
https://openalex.org/W2075685970,"A new high-pressure polymorph with a modified spinel structure, beta-Mn(2)GeO(4), is stable in a pressure range intermediate between the field of the polymorph with the olivine structure and that of another high-pressure polymorph. Oxygen atoms are located approximately in cubic close packing with manganese and germanium atoms in octahedral and tetrahedral interstices, respectively, as in the spinel structure; however, germanium atoms form Ge(2)O(7) groups instead of isolated GeO(4) groups."
https://openalex.org/W1984379650,"Analysis of distributional patterns of shallow-water molluscan faunas of the middle latitudes of the marginal northeastern Pacific Ocean discloses a sharp reversal during the Miocene of the progressive climatic deterioration. A low point in the Tertiary cooling trend during the Oligocene was followed by climatic warming that culminated during the middle Miocene, as illustrated by a series of zoogeographic profiles."

https://openalex.org/W1992530558,"Female alkali bees (Nomia melanderi) opened sealed cells containing brood infested with Aspergillus flavus, A. tamarii, Fusarium solani, Rhizopus sp., or Mucor sp. and filled them with compact soil, thus reducing fungus sporulation. Such awareness of the condition of sealed brood is hitherto unknown among solitary bees."
