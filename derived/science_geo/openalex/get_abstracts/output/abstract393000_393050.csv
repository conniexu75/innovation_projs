https://openalex.org/W1970637701,"A molecular mechanism that links the mTOR and autophagy pathways is now revealed. Depending on nutrient availability, the AMPK and mTOR kinases differentially phosphorylate the autophagy-initiating kinase Ulk1 to regulate its activity. Autophagy is a process by which components of the cell are degraded to maintain essential activity and viability in response to nutrient limitation. Extensive genetic studies have shown that the yeast ATG1 kinase has an essential role in autophagy induction. Furthermore, autophagy is promoted by AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a key energy sensor and regulates cellular metabolism to maintain energy homeostasis. Conversely, autophagy is inhibited by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a central cell-growth regulator that integrates growth factor and nutrient signals. Here we demonstrate a molecular mechanism for regulation of the mammalian autophagy-initiating kinase Ulk1, a homologue of yeast ATG1. Under glucose starvation, AMPK promotes autophagy by directly activating Ulk1 through phosphorylation of Ser 317 and Ser 777. Under nutrient sufficiency, high mTOR activity prevents Ulk1 activation by phosphorylating Ulk1 Ser 757 and disrupting the interaction between Ulk1 and AMPK. This coordinated phosphorylation is important for Ulk1 in autophagy induction. Our study has revealed a signalling mechanism for Ulk1 regulation and autophagy induction in response to nutrient signalling."

https://openalex.org/W1998000745,"Development, differentiation and response to environmental stimuli are characterized by sequential changes in cellular state initiated by the de novo binding of regulated transcriptional factors to their cognate genomic sites. The mechanism whereby a given regulatory factor selects a limited number of in vivo targets from a myriad of potential genomic binding sites is undetermined. Here we show that up to 95% of de novo genomic binding by the glucocorticoid receptor, a paradigmatic ligand-activated transcription factor, is targeted to preexisting foci of accessible chromatin. Factor binding invariably potentiates chromatin accessibility. Cell-selective glucocorticoid receptor occupancy patterns appear to be comprehensively predetermined by cell-specific differences in baseline chromatin accessibility patterns, with secondary contributions from local sequence features. The results define a framework for understanding regulatory factor-genome interactions and provide a molecular basis for the tissue selectivity of steroid pharmaceuticals and other agents that intersect the living genome."

https://openalex.org/W1990366495,"Normal brain function requires the dynamic interaction of functionally specialized but widely distributed cortical regions. Long-range synchronization of oscillatory signals has been suggested to mediate these interactions within large-scale cortical networks, but direct evidence is sparse. Here we show that oscillatory synchronization is organized in such large-scale networks. We implemented an analysis approach that allows for imaging synchronized cortical networks and applied this technique to EEG recordings in humans. We identified two networks: beta-band synchronization (~20 Hz) in a fronto-parieto-occipital network and gamma-band synchronization (~80 Hz) in a centro-temporal network. Strong perceptual correlates support their functional relevance: the strength of synchronization within these networks predicted the subjects' perception of an ambiguous audiovisual stimulus as well as the integration of auditory and visual information. Our results provide evidence that oscillatory neuronal synchronization mediates neuronal communication within frequency-specific, large-scale cortical networks."

https://openalex.org/W2089833124,"Brassinosteroids trigger a receptor kinase-mediated signalling pathway to modulate plant development through the dephosphorylation of the BZR transcription factors, which are normally kept inactive by the kinase BIN2. The phosphatase PP2A is now found to be responsible for the dephosphorylation of BZR to trigger the signalling cascade. When brassinosteroid levels are low, the GSK3-like kinase BIN2 phosphorylates and inactivates the BZR1 transcription factor to inhibit growth in plants. Brassinosteroid promotes growth by inducing dephosphorylation of BZR1, but the phosphatase that dephosphorylates BZR1 has remained unknown. Here, using tandem affinity purification, we identified protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as a BZR1-interacting protein. Genetic analyses demonstrated a positive role for PP2A in brassinosteroid signalling and BZR1 dephosphorylation. Members of the B’ regulatory subunits of PP2A directly interact with BZR1’s putative PEST domain containing the site of the bzr1-1D mutation. Interaction with and dephosphorylation by PP2A are enhanced by the bzr1-1D mutation, reduced by two intragenic bzr1-1D suppressor mutations, and abolished by deletion of the PEST domain. This study reveals a crucial function for PP2A in dephosphorylating and activating BZR1 and completes the set of core components of the brassinosteroid-signalling cascade from cell surface receptor kinase to gene regulation in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2045311514,"Most current Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies in advanced phases of development target amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) production, aggregation, or accumulation. Translational models suggest that anti-Aβ therapies may be highly effective if tested as agents to prevent or delay development of the disease or as therapies for asymptomatic patients with very early signs of AD pathology. However, anti-Aβ therapeutics are currently being tested in symptomatic patients where they are likely to be much less effective or ineffective. The lack of alignment between human clinical studies and preclinical studies, together with predictions about optimal trial design based on our understanding of the initiating role of Aβ aggregates in AD, has created a treatment versus prevention dilemma. In this perspective, we discuss why it is imperative to resolve this dilemma and suggest ways for moving forward in the hopes of enhancing the development of truly effective AD therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1967119663,"The extent of diversity among bitter-sensing neurons is a fundamental issue in the field of taste. Data are limited and conflicting as to whether bitter neurons are broadly tuned and uniform, resulting in indiscriminate avoidance of bitter stimuli, or diverse, allowing a more discerning evaluation of food sources. We provide a systematic analysis of how bitter taste is encoded by the major taste organ of the Drosophila head, the labellum. Each of 16 bitter compounds is tested physiologically against all 31 taste hairs, revealing responses that are diverse in magnitude and dynamics. Four functional classes of bitter neurons are defined. Four corresponding classes are defined through expression analysis of all 68 gustatory taste receptors. A receptor-to-neuron-to-tastant map is constructed. Misexpression of one receptor confers bitter responses as predicted by the map. These results reveal a degree of complexity that greatly expands the capacity of the system to encode bitter taste."
https://openalex.org/W2110673629,"Stressful events during adulthood are potent adverse environmental factors that can predispose individuals to psychiatric disorders, including depression; however, many individuals exposed to stressful events can adapt and function normally. While stress vulnerability may influence depression, the molecular mechanisms underlying the susceptibility and adaptation to chronic stress within the brain are poorly understood. In this study, two genetically distinct mouse strains that exhibit different behavioral responses to chronic stress were used to demonstrate how the differential epigenetic status of the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf) gene in the ventral striatum modulates susceptibility and adaptation to chronic stress. Our results suggest that the histone modifications and DNA methylation of the Gdnf promoter have crucial roles in the control of behavioral responses to chronic stress. Our data provide insights into these mechanisms, suggesting that epigenetic modifications of Gdnf, along with genetic and environmental factors, contribute to behavioral responses to stress."
https://openalex.org/W2093964879,"Ciliary dysfunction leads to a broad range of overlapping phenotypes, collectively termed ciliopathies. This grouping is underscored by genetic overlap, where causal genes can also contribute modifier alleles to clinically distinct disorders. Here we show that mutations in TTC21B, which encodes the retrograde intraflagellar transport protein IFT139, cause both isolated nephronophthisis and syndromic Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy. Moreover, although resequencing of TTC21B in a large, clinically diverse ciliopathy cohort and matched controls showed a similar frequency of rare changes, in vivo and in vitro evaluations showed a significant enrichment of pathogenic alleles in cases (P < 0.003), suggesting that TTC21B contributes pathogenic alleles to ∼5% of ciliopathy cases. Our data illustrate how genetic lesions can be both causally associated with diverse ciliopathies and interact in trans with other disease-causing genes and highlight how saturated resequencing followed by functional analysis of all variants informs the genetic architecture of inherited disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2135414903,"At presynaptic active zones, neurotransmitter release is initiated by the opening of voltage-gated Ca²+ channels close to docked vesicles. The mechanisms that enrich Ca²+ channels at active zones are, however, largely unknown, possibly because of the limited presynaptic accessibility of most synapses. Here, we have established a Cre-lox based conditional knockout approach at a presynaptically accessible central nervous system synapse, the calyx of Held, to directly study the functions of RIM proteins. Removal of all RIM1/2 isoforms strongly reduced the presynaptic Ca²+ channel density, revealing a role of RIM proteins in Ca²+ channel targeting. Removal of RIMs also reduced the readily releasable pool, paralleled by a similar reduction of the number of docked vesicles, and the Ca²+ channel-vesicle coupling was decreased. Thus, RIM proteins co-ordinately regulate key functions for fast transmitter release, enabling a high presynaptic Ca²+ channel density and vesicle docking at the active zone."
https://openalex.org/W1998906741,"Feeding of modified carbohydrates has previously led to metabolic incorporation of these compounds into cellular glycans. Now the strategic use of a thiol analog that can be converted into an activated sugar but not incorporated into glycans provides a potent intracellular glycosyltransferase inhibitor. Glycosyltransferases are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze the assembly of glycoconjugates throughout all kingdoms of nature. A long-standing problem is the rational design of probes that can be used to manipulate glycosyltransferase activity in cells and tissues. Here we describe the rational design and synthesis of a nucleotide sugar analog that inhibits, with high potency both in vitro and in cells, the human glycosyltransferase responsible for the reversible post-translational modification of nucleocytoplasmic proteins with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues (O-GlcNAc). We show that the enzymes of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway can transform, both in vitro and in cells, a synthetic carbohydrate precursor into the nucleotide sugar analog. Treatment of cells with the precursor lowers O-GlcNAc in a targeted manner with a single-digit micromolar EC50. This approach to inhibition of glycosyltransferases should be applicable to other members of this superfamily of enzymes and enable their manipulation in a biological setting."
https://openalex.org/W2031522258,"At a synapse, the presynaptic active zone mediates synaptic vesicle exocytosis. RIM proteins are active zone scaffolding molecules that—among others—mediate vesicle priming and directly or indirectly interact with most other essential presynaptic proteins. In particular, the Zn2+ finger domain of RIMs binds to the C2A domain of the priming factor Munc13, which forms a homodimer in the absence of RIM but a heterodimer with it. Here, we show that RIMs mediate vesicle priming not by coupling Munc13 to other active zone proteins as thought but by directly activating Munc13. Specifically, we found that the isolated Zn2+ finger domain of RIMs autonomously promoted vesicle priming by binding to Munc13, thereby relieving Munc13 homodimerization. Strikingly, constitutively monomeric mutants of Munc13 rescued priming in RIM-deficient synapses, whereas wild-type Munc13 did not. Both mutant and wild-type Munc13, however, rescued priming in Munc13-deficient synapses. Thus, homodimerization of Munc13 inhibits its priming function, and RIMs activate priming by disrupting Munc13 homodimerization.

The Release of Neural Transmitter Substances. Liverpool Univ Press, Liverpool1969Google Scholar). Synaptic vesicle exocytosis is highly regulated, consistent with its role as the gatekeeper of neurotransmission (Stevens, 2003Stevens C.F. Neurotransmitter release at central synapses.Neuron. 2003; 40: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Each event of exocytosis is induced by an action potential that induces Ca2+ influx via Ca2+ channels located in or near the active zone. The efficacy of action-potential-induced exocytosis depends on at least three parameters: the local activity of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, the number of release-ready vesicles, and the Ca2+ sensitivity of these vesicles. Remarkably, none of the proteins that mediate these parameters (i.e., Ca2+ channels, the presynaptic fusion machinery composed of SNARE and SM proteins, and the Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin) is exclusively localized to the active zone. Instead, their functions are organized at presynaptic release sites by the protein components of active zones (Südhof, 2004Südhof T.C. The synaptic vesicle cycle.Annu. Rev.

Priming activates synaptic vesicles for exocytosis, thereby creating the readily releasable pool (RRP) of vesicles. However, the nature of priming in general, and of the role of RIMs in priming in particular, remains unknown; even the relation of priming to docking—the process that physically attaches vesicles to the active zone as analyzed by electron microscopy—is unclear.

Although the nonphysiological nature of the sucrose stimulus limits its usefulness (e.g., see Wu and Borst, 1999Wu L.G. Borst J.G.

The synaptic vesicle membrane fusion machinery is composed of SNARE and SM proteins and constitutes a central element of priming; in addition, multiple other priming proteins have been characterized. Among these, the most important besides RIMs are likely Munc13s, which are multidomain proteins of active zones that are essential for all synaptic vesicle priming and additionally participate in shaping short-term synaptic plasticity (Brose et al., 1995Brose N.

A Munc13/RIM/Rab3 tripartite complex: From priming to plasticity?.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2839-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Most RIM isoforms contain an N-terminal Zn2+ finger domain that binds to the N-terminal C2A domain of the Munc13 isoforms Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2. Importantly, the Munc13 C2A domain (which does not bind Ca2+, different from synaptotagmin C2 domains but similar to RIM C2 domains) forms a tight homodimer in the absence of the RIM Zn2+ finger; binding of the RIM Zn2+ finger to the Munc13 C2A domain converts this homodimer into a RIM/Munc13 heterodimer (Dulubova et al., 2005Dulubova I.

Furthermore, the Zn2+ finger domain of RIMs is flanked by α-helical sequences that bind to Rab3 (Wang et al., 1997Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K. Südhof T.C. Rim is a putative Rab3 effector in regulating synaptic-vesicle fusion.Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal sequence of RIMs can mediate simultaneous binding of RIMs to Munc13 as a priming factor and to Rab3 as a vesicle GTP-binding protein (Dulubova et al., 2005Dulubova I. Lou X. Lu J. Huryeva I. Alam A. Schneggenburger R. Südhof T.C. Rizo J.

Together, the structural and genetic data on the Munc13/RIM/Rab3 complex prompted the hypothesis that RIMs activate synaptic vesicle priming by recruiting Munc13 to the active zone and stabilizing it there and that the crucial function of RIMs is to colocalize Munc13 with synaptic vesicles via their N-terminal sequences and with other active zone proteins and Ca2+ channels via their C-terminal sequences (Wang et al., 1997Wang Y.

In the present paper, we have tested this hypothesis using rescue experiments with newly generated conditional double-knockout (DKO) mice targeting all major presynaptic RIM isoforms (Kaeser et al., 2011Kaeser P.S. Deng L. Wang Y. Dulubova I. Liu X. Castillo P.E. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. RIM proteins tether Ca2+-channels to presynaptic active zones via a direct PDZ-domain interaction.Cell. 2011; 144 (this issue): 282-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we find that RIMs do not act during vesicle priming as classical scaffolding proteins, i.e., that their mechanism of action does not require the close colocalization of target proteins. Instead, we show that the isolated RIM Zn2+ finger domain is sufficient for activating priming, and that it functions by binding to Munc13, thereby disrupting Munc13 homodimers. Specifically, we show that mutant, constitutively monomeric forms of Munc13 can reverse the priming deficiency in RIM-deficient synapses, whereas wild-type Munc13 cannot, but strikingly both mutant monomeric and wild-type Munc13 rescue priming in Munc13-deficient synapses. Thus, RIMs switch on Munc13's priming function by disrupting the autoinhibitory homodimerization of Munc13. We recently generated conditional DKO mice in which cre-recombinase deletes expression of all multidomain presynaptic RIM isoforms (i.e., RIM1α, 1β, 2α, 2β, and 2γ; Kaeser et al., 2011Kaeser P.S. Deng L. Wang Y. Dulubova I. Liu X. Castillo P.E. Rizo J. Südhof T.C.

To explore how RIMs function in synaptic vesicle priming, we cultured hippocampal neurons from conditional RIM DKO mice and infected them either with a lentivirus expressing inactive mutant (control) or active wild-type EGFP-tagged cre-recombinase (referred to as cDKO neurons). Measurements of spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory “mini” synaptic events (mEPSCs and mIPSCs, respectively) showed that the frequency of mEPSCs and mIPSCs was decreased more than 10- and more than 3-fold, respectively, in RIM-deficient neurons, whereas their amplitudes were unchanged (Figures 1A and 1B ). This finding supports previous data that RIMs are essential for a normal presynaptic release probability in excitatory and inhibitory synapses (Schoch et al., 2002Schoch S. Castillo P.E. Jo T.

https://openalex.org/W2030385147,"3MC syndrome has been proposed as a unifying term encompassing the overlapping Carnevale, Mingarelli, Malpuech and Michels syndromes. These rare autosomal recessive disorders exhibit a spectrum of developmental features, including characteristic facial dysmorphism, cleft lip and/or palate, craniosynostosis, learning disability and genital, limb and vesicorenal anomalies. Here we studied 11 families with 3MC syndrome and identified two mutated genes, COLEC11 and MASP1, both of which encode proteins in the lectin complement pathway (collectin kidney 1 (CL-K1) and MASP-1 and MASP-3, respectively). CL-K1 is highly expressed in embryonic murine craniofacial cartilage, heart, bronchi, kidney and vertebral bodies. Zebrafish morphants for either gene develop pigmentary defects and severe craniofacial abnormalities. Finally, we show that CL-K1 serves as a guidance cue for neural crest cell migration. Together, these findings demonstrate a role for complement pathway factors in fundamental developmental processes and in the etiology of 3MC syndrome."

The yearly migration is one of the most astonishing and biologically intriguing phenomena in the animal world. Behavioral experiments have shown that the migrants use a time-compensated sun compass to maintain a southerly flight direction over the duration of the migration (Perez et al., 1997Perez S.M. Taylor O.R. Jander R. A sun compass in monarch butterflies.Nature. 1997; 387: 29Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, Mouritsen and Frost, 2002Mouritsen H. Frost B.J.

Illuminating the circadian clock in monarch butterfly migration.Science. 2003; 300: 1303-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In general, this sun compass mechanism postulates that skylight cues, providing directional information, are sensed by the eyes and that this sensory information is then transmitted to a sun compass system in the central brain. There, information from both eyes is integrated and time compensated by the circadian clock so that flight direction is constantly adjusted to maintain a southerly bearing over the day. The monarch butterfly is an excellent model in which to study the time compensation process, because more is known about its circadian clock mechanism and clock cellular locations than in any other nondrosophilid insect (Reppert, 2007Reppert S.M. The ancestral circadian clock of monarch butterflies: Role in time-compensated sun compass orientation.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2007; 72: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). How are skylight cues used by migrating monarchs (Figure 1)? Flight simulator experiments have shown that the visibility of the outdoor sun, the most prominent light in the sky, is sufficient for proper orientation (Stalleicken et al., 2005Stalleicken J. Mukhida M. Labhart T. Wehner R. Frost B. Mouritsen H. Do monarch butterflies use polarized skylight for migratory orientation?.J. Exp. Biol. 2005; 208: 2399-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, other cues resulting from the scattering of sunlight, such as the pattern of polarized light and spectral gradients in the sky, also contain orientation information (Wehner, 2001Wehner R. Polarization vision—a uniform sensory capacity?.J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 2589-2596PubMed Google Scholar, Coemans et al., 1994Coemans M.A. Vos Hzn J.J. Nuboer J.F. The relation between celestial colour gradients and the position of the sun, with regard to the sun compass.Vision Res. 1994; 34: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). As the electric field vectors of linearly polarized light (E-vectors) are arranged in concentric circles around the sun, they can indicate the sun's position, even when the sun itself is covered by clouds and only a small patch of blue sky is visible (Labhart, 1999Labhart T. How polarization-sensitive interneurones of crickets see the polarization pattern of the sky: A field study with an opto-electronic model neurone.J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 757-770PubMed Google Scholar). However, the symmetrical nature of skylight E-vectors leads to directional ambiguity unless they are integrated with the solar azimuth (the horizontal angular position of the sun) (Rossel et al., 1978Rossel S.

For the detection of E-vector orientations, monarch butterflies, like most insects, possess a specialized dorsal rim area (DRA) of the compound eye (Reppert et al., 2004Reppert S.M. Zhu H. White R.H. Polarized light helps monarch butterflies navigate.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, Stalleicken et al., 2006Stalleicken J. Labhart T.

Furthermore, monarchs were shown to respond to changes in the skylight polarization pattern with predictable changes in flight orientation (Reppert et al., 2004Reppert S.M. Zhu H. White R.H.

Although information about the central neuronal processing of skylight cues in the monarch brain has been lacking, a substantial amount of knowledge has been gathered about polarized light processing in the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria). After E-vector detection in the locust DRA, information is passed through the optic lobe (Homberg and Paech, 2002Homberg U. Paech A.

Dev. 2002; 30: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, Homberg et al., 2003Homberg U. Hofer S. Pfeiffer K. Gebhardt S. Organization and neural connections of the anterior optic tubercle in the brain of the locust, Schistocerca gregaria.J. Comp.

Kinoshita M. Homberg U. Polarization-sensitive and light-sensitive neurons in two parallel pathways passing through the anterior optic tubercle in the locust brain.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 3903-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Information from both eyes is then integrated in the central complex (CC) (Vitzthum et al., 2002Vitzthum H. Müller M. Homberg U. Neurons of the central complex of the locust Schistocerca gregaria are sensitive to polarized light.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1114-1125PubMed Google Scholar), a midline structure in the central brain. Within the CC, an array of neurons possess E-vector tunings that provide a topographical representation of the solar azimuth, such that the CC has emerged as the likely site of the insect sun compass (Heinze and Homberg, 2007Heinze S. Homberg U. Maplike representation of celestial E-vector orientations in the brain of an insect.Science. 2007; 315: 995-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Spectral information appears to be integrated with E-vector information at an early stage of the locust brain, helping resolve the directional ambiguity inherent in the symmetrical nature of skylight E-vectors mentioned above (Kinoshita et al., 2007Kinoshita M. Pfeiffer K. Homberg U. Spectral properties of identified polarized-light sensitive interneurons in the brain of the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria.J. Exp.

Coding of azimuthal directions via time-compensated combination of celestial compass cues.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 960-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is possible that a fundamentally similar integration mechanism for directionality also occurs in the monarch butterfly. To ultimately understand clock-compass interactions in monarchs, we have begun to anatomically and physiologically characterize the internal sun compass network in the butterfly, using the well-delineated sun compass network of the locust as a basis for comparison. Our results reveal the general layout of the neuronal machinery for sun compass navigation in the monarch brain, provide the first insights into a possible mechanism of integrating E-vector information and solar azimuth, and identify unique features of neuronal skylight sensing. More generally, the results address a fundamental problem of sensory processing by showing how seemingly contradictory skylight signals are integrated into a coherent, neural representation of the environment. To study the general anatomy of the monarch brain, we first performed three-dimensional reconstructions of the major brain neuropils. We labeled whole-brain preparations of the monarch with antibodies against the synaptic marker Synapsin, acquired confocal image stacks, and, based on these images, reconstructed the size and shape of identifiable brain regions. The resulting architecture of the monarch brain (Figures 2A–2C ) was similar to that of other insect brains, with close resemblance to the brain of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta, the only other lepidopteran brain that has been examined in comparable detail (El Jundi et al., 2009El Jundi B.

In the monarch optic lobes, we identified and reconstructed the medulla, the lobula, the lobula plate, and the accessory medulla. In the central brain, we identified and reconstructed the central complex (CC), the anterior optic tubercles (AOTu), the antennal lobes, and the mushroom bodies (Figures 2A–2C). Because the present work focused on sun compass neuropils, the mushroom body lobes were not separated into their components; higher image resolution is required to resolve their compressed and intertwined organization. The monarch AOTu, the first processing stage for sun compass information in the central brain of the locust (Pfeiffer et al., 2005Pfeiffer K. Kinoshita M. Homberg U. Polarization-sensitive and light-sensitive neurons in two parallel pathways passing through the anterior optic tubercle in the locust brain.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 3903-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), can be divided into three components: the large upper division, the lower division, and the nodular division, with its distinct, glomerular organization (Figure 2D). With the staining procedure used, the monarch LALs, the second relay stage for compass information in the locust brain, did not show distinct boundaries, consistent with the situation in the hawkmoth. However, the monarch LALs were defined on both sides of the CC using single-cell morphologies (Figures 3C, 3E, and 3G ). Positioned posterior of the antennal lobe, they extended anteriorly, approximately from the depth of the lower division of the central body (CBL), until they almost reached the anterior surface of the brain. Simultaneous dye-fills of multiple CBL-tangential neurons revealed a distinct neuropil region containing the postsynaptic endings of these cells (Figures 3A and 3B). Because of the typical, microglomerular shape of these endings, this neuropil region is probably the monarch homolog of the combined lateral triangle/medial olive areas of the locust (data not shown). Spatially, these areas were located on either side of the midline, between the LAL and the posterioventral surface of the mushroom body lobes, and slightly anterior to the CBL. We next focused on the detailed reconstruction of the monarch CC, the proposed integration site of sun compass information in the insect brain. High-resolution confocal imaging revealed that the butterfly CC, as in other insect species, can be divided into four major components, the protocerebral bridge (PB), the upper division of the central body (CBU), the CBL, and the paired noduli (Figures 2E–2J). However, unlike in the locust brain, the orientation of the monarch CC and the remaining central brain were rotated by roughly 90° (around the sagittal axis), with respect to the fixed orientation of the optic lobes. Therefore, the monarch PB is located on the posterior side of the central body close to the posterior surface of the brain (Figures 2E–2G). The distinctly noncontinuous layout of two hemispheres of the monarch PB again resembled the situation in the hawkmoth. The central body and the PB were separated by a midline-spanning neuropil that left two gaps on either side for passage of the W-, X-, Y-, and Z-bundles. These massive tracts provide the only connection between the PB and central body and contain the axons of all compass-related columnar neurons of the CC. Within the central body, the bean-shaped CBL was located anterior to the larger CBU, while the noduli were located ventrally (Figure 2E). We reconstructed individual neurons of the monarch CC to further define the butterfly sun compass network and substantiate that the layout of this brain area is highly conserved between locusts and monarchs. Of the five groups of neuron (TL, CL1, TB, CPU1, CP) known to constitute the polarization vision network of the locust central complex (Heinze et al., 2009Heinze S. Gotthardt S. Homberg U. Transformation of polarized light information in the central complex of the locust.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11783-11793Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we identified four groups in the monarch CC, covering all processing stages from the proposed input to the proposed output neurons of the CC (Figure 3; Table 1). Homologies were established based on detailed information regarding the location of input/output arborizations, the structure of terminals, and the heterolateral connectivity patterns (Figure S1 available online, Figure 3, Table 1). Consequently, we classified the identified neurons as monarch butterfly versions of TL2 (n = 6), TL3 (n = 5), CL1 (n = 4), TB1 (n = 4), CPU1a (n = 6), and CPU1b neurons (n = 1). Although subtypes of CL1 neurons could not be identified unambiguously in the monarch, CPU1 subtypes (CPU1a/b) could be clearly distinguished in monarchs because all arborizations of CPU1b neurons were located contralateral to the soma (Figure 3E), which is the defining feature of locust CPU1b cells (Heinze and Homberg, 2008Heinze S. Homberg U. Neuroarchitecture of the central complex of the desert locust: Intrinsic and columnar neurons.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 511: 454-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar; Figure S1E). In addition to neurons of the core polarization-sensitive network, conditionally polarization-sensitive neurons of the locust provide another level of complexity to the CC-network, as they are thought to be recruited only in a context-dependent manner (Heinze and Homberg, 2009Heinze S. Homberg U. Linking the input to the output: New sets of neurons complement the polarization vision network in the locust central complex.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 4911-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Likewise, homologs of all three conditionally polarization-sensitive cell types were also identified in the monarch CC (CL2, CPU2, and CPU4) (Table 1). The only major types of neuron that were not found in the monarch were homologs of locust cells directly connecting the PB with the lateral triangle/medial olive (CP1, CP2).Table 1Morphology of Neuronal Cell Types Involved in Polarized Light Processing in the Locust and Their Monarch Butterfly Homologs∗Neurites could not be traced beyond the posterior chiasma (located between the central body and the protocerebral bridge).∗∗Arborizations in the protocerebral bridge are located contralateral to the soma.Neurons from the monarch butterfly are drawn in black, while neurons from the desert locust are shown in gray.

Not only were the CC components of the polarization vision network largely conserved between the species, but the input and proposed output pathways were also comparable. On the input side, we could identify neurons connecting one of the small subunits of the AOTu with the lateral triangle of the LALs (TuLAL1; n = 10; Figure 3F, Table 1). On the output side, a characteristically shaped neuron was identified that connected large parts of the LAL with regions of the unstructured protocerebrum, located lateral and dorsal to the monarch central body (LAL-PC-neuron; n = 1; Figure 3G; Figure S1G). We next used intracellular recordings to examine the response properties of CC monarch neurons in the context of neural integration of the major skylight cues (polarized and unpolarized light stimuli). There were three considerations for evaluating these recordings. First, which skylight cues are actually processed by the monarch central brain? Second, how do monarchs resolve the directional ambiguity of skylight E-vectors (Figure 1A)—that is, do they use spectral gradients for distinguishing the solar and antisolar hemisphere, as suggested for locusts? The third issue was defining how polarized and unpolarized light responses are integrated to ensure that E-vector tuning actually provides an accurate reflection of the solar azimuth over the course of the day (Figures 1A and 1B). For recordings, a migratory butterfly was mounted in the recording setup. Two types of visual stimuli (linear polarized light and unpolarized light spots) were applied during experimentation (Figure 1C). Prior to recordings, all migrants were housed in 11 hr of light and 13 hr of darkness, simulating outdoor lighting conditions at capture; physiological experiments were centered around Zeitgeber time (ZT) 5, which was 5 hr after lights-on, so that substantial variation in time-of-day of recording would not confound the results. Nonmigratory monarchs were used for initial recordings and some control experiments. When presented with zenith-positioned polarized light in the UV range (365 nm), 33 neurons of the monarch brain responded with significant E-vector-dependent modulations of their spike frequency, as revealed by circular statistics (p < 0.05; Figure 4). Polarized UV light was used because the monarch DRA ommatidia only express a UV opsin (Sauman et al., 2005Sauman I. Briscoe A.D. Zhu H. Shi D. Froy O. Stalleicken J. Yuan Q. Casselman A. Reppert S.M.

All of these cells were components of the proposed polarization vision network described above. We identified seven TuLAL1 cells, six TL-type cells, two CL1 cells, an individual TB1 cell, and three CPU1 neurons; hence E-vector-dependent responses were present from the input stage of the polarization vision network (TuLA"

https://openalex.org/W2016979375,"Signalling by the GTPase RhoA, a key regulator of epithelial cell behaviour, can stimulate opposing processes: RhoA can promote junction formation and apical constriction, and reduce adhesion and cell spreading. Molecular mechanisms are thus required that ensure spatially restricted and process-specific RhoA activation. For many fundamental processes, including assembly of the epithelial junctional complex, such mechanisms are still unknown. Here we show that p114RhoGEF is a junction-associated protein that drives RhoA signalling at the junctional complex and regulates tight-junction assembly and epithelial morphogenesis. p114RhoGEF is required for RhoA activation at cell-cell junctions, and its depletion stimulates non-junctional Rho signalling and induction of myosin phosphorylation along the basal domain. Depletion of GEF-H1, a RhoA activator inhibited by junctional recruitment, does not reduce junction-associated RhoA activation. p114RhoGEF associates with a complex containing myosin II, Rock II and the junctional adaptor cingulin, indicating that p114RhoGEF is a component of a junction-associated Rho signalling module that drives spatially restricted activation of RhoA to regulate junction formation and epithelial morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2165942284,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, glycosylation and ubiquitylation, leading to diverse physiological consequences and modulation of its biological activity. There is increasing evidence that methylation may parallel other post-translational modifications in the regulation of various biological processes. It is still not known, however, whether EGFR is regulated by this post-translational event. Here, we show that EGFR Arg 1175 is methylated by an arginine methyltransferase, PRMT5. Arg 1175 methylation positively modulates EGF-induced EGFR trans-autophosphorylation at Tyr 1173, which governs ERK activation. Abolishment of Arg 1175 methylation enhances EGF-stimulated ERK activation by reducing SHP1 recruitment to EGFR, resulting in augmented cell proliferation, migration and invasion of EGFR-expressing cells. Therefore, we propose a model in which the regulatory crosstalk between PRMT5-mediated Arg 1175 methylation and EGF-induced Tyr 1173 phosphorylation attenuates EGFR-mediated ERK activation."
https://openalex.org/W2053720936,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in tumorigenecity by regulating specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and their roles in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are becoming apparent. Distinct from the CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) sub-population, we have isolated a novel PROCR(+)/ESA(+) BCSC sub-population. To explore miRNA-regulatory mechanisms in this sub-population, we performed miRNA expression profiling and found miR-495 as the most highly upegulated miRNA in PROCR(+)/ESA(+) cells. Coincidently, high upregulation of miR-495 was also found in CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) BCSCs, reflecting its potential importance in maintaining common BCSC properties. Ectopic expression of miR-495 in breast cancer cells promoted their colony formation in vitro and tumorigenesis in mice. miR-495 directly suppressed E-cadherin expression to promote cell invasion and inhibited REDD1 expression to enhance cell proliferation in hypoxia through post-transcriptional mechanism. miR-495 expression was directly modulated by transcription factor E12/E47, which itself is highly expressed in BCSCs. These findings reveal a novel regulatory pathway centered on miR-495 that contributes to BCSC properties and hypoxia resistance."

Structurally, in addition to the membrane-proximal neurotrophin-binding immunoglobulin-like domain (Ig2), all Trks contain an additional extracellular Ig domain (Ig1) and leucine-rich repeats flanked by cysteine clusters (LRRCC) (Huang and Reichardt, 2003Huang E.J.

The in vivo importance of these proteins for synapse development is supported by knockout mouse and human disease studies. For example, neuroligin-1,2,3 triple knockout is perinatally lethal due to defects in synaptic transmission (Varoqueaux et al., 2006Varoqueaux F. Aramuni G. Rawson R.L. Mohrmann R. Missler M.

Recently, given the molecular and functional diversity of synapses, we have been working on globally identifying the full set of potent synaptogenic adhesion molecules by using an unbiased functional expression screen (Linhoff et al., 2009Linhoff M.W. Lauren J. Cassidy R.M. Dobie F.A. Takahashi H. Nygaard H.B. Airaksinen M.S. Strittmatter S.M. Craig A.M. An unbiased expression screen for synaptogenic proteins identifies the LRRTM protein family as synaptic organizers.Neuron. 2009; 61: 734-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We screened >105 clones of a custom postnatal brain full-length cDNA expression library in pools in a neuron-fibroblast coculture assay to identify factors able to trigger presynaptic differentiation in contacting hippocampal axons. From this screen, we reisolated neuroligin and NGL-3 and first identified LRRTMs as synaptogenic. Here, we report the isolation of neurotrophin receptor TrkC noncatalytic form as a synaptogenic adhesion molecule that triggers excitatory presynaptic differentiation. All TrkC isoforms, but not TrkA or TrkB, are synaptogenic via neurotrophin-independent binding to the axonal tyrosine phosphatase receptor PTPσ. Extensive induction, localization, and function-blocking experiments in vitro and in vivo support the conclusion that transsynaptic interaction between dendritic TrkC and axonal PTPσ generates bidirectional noncatalytic signaling essential for excitatory pre- and postsynaptic differentiation in neural network development. Here, we continued the unbiased expression screen for mammalian synaptogenic proteins that trigger presynaptic differentiation when presented on COS cells to axons of cocultured hippocampal neurons (Linhoff et al., 2009Linhoff M.W. Lauren J. Cassidy R.M. Dobie F.A. Takahashi H. Nygaard H.B. Airaksinen M.S. Strittmatter S.M. Craig A.M. An unbiased expression screen for synaptogenic proteins identifies the LRRTM protein family as synaptic organizers.Neuron. 2009; 61: 734-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We subdivided PB270, one positive cDNA pool that contained about 250 clones, to identify the single clone responsible for its synaptogenic activity (Figures S1A and S1B, available online). Both positive single clones isolated, PDB 270-46-2-3H and PDB 270-46-17-9M, encode neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinase TrkC, noncatalytic form (GenBank accession number: BC078844). This TrkC isoform, here called TrkCTK- (also known as TrkCic158, TrkCNC2, and TrkCT1), is the most abundant of four noncatalytic TrkC isoforms that through alternative splicing lack tyrosine kinase domains and have alternative shorter intracellular domains (Barbacid, 1994Barbacid M. The Trk family of neurotrophin receptors.J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1386-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, Valenzuela et al., 1993Valenzuela D.M. Maisonpierre P.C. Glass D.J. Rojas E.

Alternative forms of rat TrkC with different functional capabilities.Neuron. 1993; 10: 963-974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We first tested whether all neurotrophin receptors induce presynaptic differentiation. We performed the coculture assay by using COS cells expressing each neurotrophin receptor tagged intracellularly with ECFP and quantified clustering of the presynaptic component synapsin in contacting axons. Only TrkC, but not TrkA, noncatalytic TrkB (TrkBTK-, also known as TrkB.T1), catalytic TrkB (TrkBTK+), or p75NTR low-affinity receptor, induced synapsin clustering in hippocampal axons (Figures 1A–1C ). Surface protein expression of TrkA, TrkB, or p75NTR on COS cells was similar to or higher than that of TrkC (Figures S1C–S1H), suggesting that the lack of synaptogenic activity is not due to insufficient surface expression. TrkC catalytic forms (TrkCTK+ and TrkCKI25) as well as TrkCTK- all promoted synapsin clustering as efficiently as positive-control neuroligin-2 (NLG2), the most potent of the neuroligins (Figures 1A–1C). Unlike neuroligins and NGL-3, which induce both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic differentiation (Chih et al., 2005Chih B. Engelman H. Scheiffele P. Control of excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation by neuroligins.Science. 2005; 307: 1324-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, Woo et al., 2009Woo J. Kwon S.K. Choi S. Kim S.

Neurosci. 2009; 12: 428-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), all isoforms of TrkC induced only clustering of excitatory presynaptic marker VGLUT1, but not of inhibitory presynaptic marker VGAT in coculture (Figures 1D–1G). These results suggest not only that TrkC may function specifically at excitatory synapses but also that the presynaptic receptor of TrkC might be different from neurexins and LAR, the main presynaptic receptors for neuroligins and NGL-3, respectively (Sudhof, 2008Sudhof T.C. Neuroligins and neurexins link synaptic function to cognitive disease.Nature. 2008; 455: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar, Woo et al., 2009Woo J. Kwon S.K. Choi S. Kim S. Lee J.R.

TrkCTK- or TrkCTK+ also induced uptake of antibodies against the lumenal domain of synaptotagmin I (SynTag), which is accessible on the neuron surface only during active recycling of synaptic vesicles (Figures 1H–1J). Together, these data indicate that TrkC induces the differentiation of functional excitatory presynaptic terminals. TrkC binds to neurotrophin NT-3, but not to NGF or BDNF (Barbacid, 1994Barbacid M. The Trk family of neurotrophin receptors.J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1386-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, Huang and Reichardt, 2003Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Trk receptors: Roles in neuronal signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar); Ig2 of TrkC is necessary and sufficient for NT-3 binding (Urfer et al., 1995Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Shelton D.L. Parada L.F. Presta L.G. An immunoglobulin-like domain determines the specificity of neurotrophin receptors.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2795-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To determine the domains responsible for TrkC synaptogenic activity, we tested several TrkC deletion mutants by scoring synapsin clustering in the coculture assay. The TrkC extracellular domain (ECD) was necessary and sufficient for synaptogenic activity; the intracellular domain (ICD) was not required (Figure 1L). TrkC mutants lacking LRRCC, Ig1, or LRRNT, the initial part of LRRCC, did not have synaptogenic activity (Figures 1L and 1M). Lack of synaptogenic activity was not due to insufficient surface expression of these mutants (Figures S1C–S1H). The mutant lacking Ig2, the NT-3-binding domain, still had synaptogenic activity. We also tested TrkC containing point mutations that abolish NT-3 binding (N366AT369A) (Urfer et al., 1998Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Hongo J.A. Zhao W. Presta L.G. High resolution mapping of the binding site of TrkA for nerve growth factor and TrkC for neurotrophin-3 on the second immunoglobulin-like domain of the Trk receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5829-5840Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All noncatalytic and catalytic TrkC with NT-3-binding dead mutations still have synaptogenic activity (Figure 1L). These data indicate that NT-3 binding is not required and that both LRRCC and Ig1 are required for synaptogenic activity of TrkC. To test whether TrkC LRRCC plus Ig1 is sufficient for synaptogenic activity, we used chimeras between TrkCTK- and the nonsynaptogenic TrkBTK-. The ECD of TrkC, or just LRRCC plus IgG1 of TrkC, but not LRRCC alone, conferred synaptogenic activity on the TrkB chimera (Figures 1L and 1M). Thus, both the LRRCC and Ig1 of TrkC are necessary and sufficient for synaptogenic activity. TrkC in COS cells triggers presynaptic differentiation presumably through trans interaction with a presynaptic receptor on contacting axons. To identify the presynaptic receptor, we screened a range of candidate proteins, including neurexins, expressed in COS cells in a binding assay, by using soluble purified TrkC ectodomain fused to human immunoglobulin Fc region (TrkC-Fc) (Figure S2A). Only one candidate bound TrkC-Fc, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor PTPσ. PTPσ belongs to the type IIa subfamily of receptor tyrosine phosphatases, comprised of PTPσ, PTPδ, and LAR (Johnson and Van Vactor, 2003Johnson K.G. Van Vactor D. Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases in nervous system development.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that NGL-3 binds to PTPσ, PTPδ, and LAR via their first two fibronectin III-like domains (FNIII) (Kwon et al., 2010Kwon S.K. Woo J. Kim S.Y. Kim H. Kim E. Trans-synaptic adhesions between netrin-G ligand-3 (NGL-3) and receptor tyrosine phosphatases LAR, protein-tyrosine phosphatase delta (PTPdelta), and PTPsigma via specific domains regulate excitatory synapse formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13966-13978Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In our binding assay, soluble TrkC-Fc proteins bound only to PTPσ, not to PTPδ or LAR, nor to N-cadherin or neurexin-1β (Figures 2A and 2B ). Application of increasing amounts of TrkC-Fc to PTPσ-expressing COS cells revealed saturable binding (Figure 2C). According to Scatchard analysis, the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) value is 9.3 ± 1.2 nM, within the typical nanomolar range for biologically significant ligand-receptor interactions. TrkC still bound to PTPσ in nominally calcium-free buffer containing 10 mM EGTA (Figure 2D), suggesting Ca2+-independent interaction. The PTPσ ectodomain is composed of three Ig-like domains followed by either four or eight FNIII domains, depending on splice variant. TrkC-Fc did not bind to a PTPσ mutant lacking all three Ig domains, but bound to a mutant lacking all FNIII domains (Figure 2E), indicating that the Ig domains of PTPσ are responsible for TrkC binding. Alternative splicing also occurs within the Ig region, inserting short sequences meA and/or meB (Pulido et al., 1995Pulido R. Serra-Pages C. Tang M. Streuli M. The LAR/PTP delta/PTP sigma subfamily of transmembrane protein-tyrosine-phosphatases: Multiple human LAR, PTP delta, and PTP sigma isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and associate with the LAR-interacting protein LIP.1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 11686-11690Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). TrkC-Fc bound to all isoforms of PTPσ, although differences in intensity of bound TrkC-Fc suggest a possible modulatory effect of meB (Figure 2E). If axonal PTPσ mediates the synaptogenic activity of TrkC, PTPσ should bind to the synaptogenic region of TrkC, LRRCC plus Ig1 (Figure 1L). We tested this idea by using a soluble PTPσ ectodomain Fc fusion. PTPσ-Fc bound to COS cells expressing TrkCTK- wild-type, ΔIg2, and N366AT369A, but not to those expressing TrkCTK- ΔLRRCC, ΔIg1, or ΔLRRNT (Figures 2F and 2G). PTPσ-Fc also bound to the TrkB/C chimera TrkCLRRCC+Ig1/TrkBTK- but not to TrkCLRRCC/TrkBTK- or TrkB wild-type (Figures 2F and 2G). Taken together, these data indicate that the PTPσ-binding domain of TrkC is LRRCC and Ig1, supporting the idea that PTPσ is the presynaptic receptor through which TrkC triggers presynaptic differentiation. We also tested whether TrkC or PTPσ might interact in a homophilic manner (Figure S2). However, in our cell-binding assay, PTPσ-Fc did not bind to PTPσ itself, PTPδ, or LAR. In addition, the TrkC ectodomain with NT-3-binding dead mutations fused to Fc (TrkCN366AT369A-Fc) bound to PTPσ but did not bind to either TrkC itself or to any other neurotrophin receptors. We next investigated subcellular localization of TrkC and PTPσ in cultured hippocampal neurons. TrkC immunoreactivity with an antibody that detects all isoforms was present in a punctate pattern on dendrites of hippocampal neurons at DIV 15 (Figure 3A ). TrkC puncta colocalized well with clusters of the excitatory postsynaptic scaffold PSD-95 apposed to VGLUT1 but not with the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold gephyrin (Figures 3A and 3B). We tested specifically whether TrkCTK- and/or TrkCTK+ localize to excitatory synapses in hippocampal neurons by low-level expression of extracellularly YFP-tagged forms. Both YFP-TrkCTK- and YFP-TrkCTK+ accumulated at excitatory synaptic sites marked by PSD-95 clusters apposed to VGLUT1 clusters (Figures 3C and 3D). The presence of synaptic YFP-TrkC clusters in dendrites but not axons of transfected neurons indicated postsynaptic and not presynaptic accumulation. Immunofluorescence analysis also revealed TrkC immunoreactivity in a punctate pattern in neuropil of adult mouse brain. Moreover, TrkC puncta were apposed to VGLUT1 puncta but not to gephyrin puncta, as shown here for hippocampal CA1 region (Figures 3G–3I). These data indicate that TrkC localizes to excitatory synapses in vitro and in vivo. PTPσ immunoreactivity was also present in a punctate pattern decorating the dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons at DIV 15 and these puncta overlapped with VGLUT1 (Figure 3E). PTPσ puncta overlapping VGLUT1 were also observed on axons not contacting dendrites, suggesting an axonal localization (Figure 3E, arrowheads). PTPσ puncta were not colocalized with VGAT clusters (Figure 3F). Furthermore, PTPσ puncta were apposed to PSD-95 puncta in brain, as shown here for hippocampal CA1 region (Figure 3J). Thus, endogenous PTPσ is also localized to excitatory synaptic sites in vitro and in vivo. Next, we tested the effects of TrkC overexpression (DIV9–10→DIV14–15) in cultured hippocampal neurons. Overexpression of HA-TrkCTK- significantly enhanced synapsin clustering along dendrites compared to neurons expressing only ECFP or neighboring nontransfected neurons (Figure S3). Overexpression of HA-TrkCTK+ resulted in an abnormal morphology of neurons with retracted or beaded dendrites and also enhanced synapsin clustering along these dendrites. Overexpression of HA-TrkCTK- or HA-TrkCTK+ enhanced clustering of VGLUT1 but not of VGAT along the dendrites (Figure S3), consistent with the results of coculture experiments. Thus, TrkC expressed in neurons exerts synaptogenic activity for excitatory presynaptic differentiation. To assess whether any proteins from neurons or COS cells might be needed to cooperate with TrkC in promoting presynaptic differentiation, we investigated the synaptogenic activity of inert micron-sized beads coated with TrkC-Fc. Beads coated with TrkC-Fc, but not control Fc or TrkB-Fc, induced clustering of synapsin, the active-zone marker bassoon, and VGLUT, but not VGAT at contact sites with hippocampal axons (Figures S4A–S4F). Thus, the TrkC ectodomain is sufficient for induction of excitatory presynaptic differentiation. Furthermore, TrkC-Fc-coated beads that contact axons induced clustering of endogenous PTPσ with synapsin (Figures 4A –4C). Thus, PTPσ is expressed in axons, the TrkC ectodomain can bind to endogenous axonal PTPσ via trans interaction, and the TrkC ectodomain induces presynaptic differentiation associated with clustering of PTPσ. To test whether PTPσ mediates TrkC-induced presynaptic differentiation, we investigated synapsin clustering around TrkC-Fc-coated beads that contacted axons expressing either HA-PTPσ or HA-PTPσ lacking the intracellular domain (HA-PTPσΔICD). TrkC-Fc-coated beads induced HA-PTPσ clustering accompanied by synapsin clustering on axons (Figures 4D and 4E). TrkC-induced synapsin clustering associated with HA-PTPσ was equivalent to TrkC-induced synapsin clustering on neighboring nontransfected axons (Figure 4E), suggesting that HA-PTPσ is comparable in activity to the endogenous presynaptic receptor of TrkC. In contrast, TrkC-Fc-coated beads that induced HA-PTPσΔICD clustering on axons did not induce simultaneous clustering of synapsin (Figures 4D and 4E). Presumably, HA-PTPσΔICD effectively competed with endogenous PTPσ for TrkC binding and blocked transmembrane signaling from TrkC to axonal intracellular targets for presynaptic differentiation. Taken together, these data suggest that PTPσ is an axonal receptor for TrkC that triggers presynaptic differentiation. Next, we tested whether PTPσ ectodomain triggers excitatory postsynaptic differentiation associated with dendritic accumulation of TrkC. PTPσ-Fc-coated beads that contacted dendrites induced clustering of endogenous dendritic TrkC with NMDA receptor subunit NR1 (Figure 4F). NR1 clusters induced by PTPσ-Fc-coated beads were not apposed to synapsin (Figure 4G), indicating that these NR1 clusters were not associated with interneuronal synapses. PTPσ-Fc-coated beads also induced clustering of PSD-95 but not of gephyrin (Figures 4H and 4I). We also confirmed in the coculture assay that COS cells expressing PTPσ-CFP induced clustering of N"

However, the underlying mechanism remains undefined, as existing structural data suggest the glycan does not directly engage cell surface receptors. Here we characterize the dynamics of the glycan termini using solution NMR spectroscopy. Contrary to previous conclusions based on X-ray crystallography and limited NMR data, our spin relaxation studies indicate that the termini of both glycan branches are highly dynamic and experience considerable motion in addition to tumbling of the Fc molecule. Relaxation dispersion and temperature-dependent chemical shift perturbations demonstrate exchange of the α1-6Man-linked branch between a protein-bound and a previously unobserved unbound state, suggesting the glycan samples conformational states that can be accessed by glycan-modifying enzymes and possibly glycan recognition domains. These findings suggest a role for Fc-glycan dynamics in Fc-receptor interactions and enzymatic glycan remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2039501032,"Many forms of signal transduction occur when Ca(2+) enters the cytoplasm of a cell. It has been generally thought that there is a fast buffer that rapidly reduces the free Ca(2+) level and that it is this buffered level of Ca(2+) that triggers downstream biochemical processes, notably the activation of calmodulin (CaM) and the resulting activation of CaM-dependent enzymes. Given the importance of these transduction processes, it is crucial to understand exactly how Ca(2+) activates CaM. We have determined the rate at which Ca(2+) binds to CaM and found that Ca(2+) binds more rapidly to CaM than to other Ca(2+)-binding proteins. This property of CaM and its high concentration support a new view of signal transduction: CaM directly intercepts incoming Ca(2+) and sets the free Ca(2+) level (that is, it strongly contributes to fast Ca(2+) buffering) rather than responding to the lower Ca(2+) level set by other buffers. This property is crucial for making CaM an efficient transducer. Our results also suggest that other Ca(2+) binding proteins have a previously undescribed role in regulating the lifetime of Ca(2+) bound to CaM and thereby setting the gain of signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2095426342,"Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) is a transcriptional coactivator involved in the differentiation of stem cell as well as the development of multiple organs. Recently, TAZ has also been identified as a major component of the novel Hippo–LATS tumor suppressor pathway and to function as an oncogene in breast cancer. We show for the first time that TAZ is an oncogene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our results show that TAZ is overexpressed in NSCLC cells and that lentivirus-mediated overexpression of TAZ in HBE135 immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells causes increased cell proliferation and transformation, which can be restored back to its original levels by knockdown of TAZ. In addition, short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of TAZ expression in NSCLC cells suppresses their proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in vitro, and tumor growth in mice in vivo, which can be reversed by re-introduction of shRNA-resistant TAZ into TAZ-knockdown NSCLC cells. These results indicate that TAZ is an oncogene and has an important role in tumorigenicity of NSCLC cells. Therefore, TAZ may present a novel target for the future diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2050654618,"Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an emerging target for cancer therapy due to its important role in maintaining the activity and stability of key oncogenic signaling proteins. We show here that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)–anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion protein, presumed to be the oncogenic driver in about 5% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is associated with Hsp90 in cells and is rapidly degraded upon exposure of cells to IPI-504. We find EML4–ALK to be more sensitive to Hsp90 inhibition than either HER2 or mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with an inhibitory concentration (IC)50 for protein degradation in the low nanomolar range. This degradation leads to a potent inhibition of downstream signaling pathways and to the induction of growth arrest and apoptosis in cells carrying the EML4–ALK fusion. To generate a causative link between the expression of EML4–ALK and sensitivity to IPI-504, we introduced an EML4–ALK cDNA into HEK293 cells and show that the expression of the fusion protein sensitizes cells to IPI-504 both in vitro and in vivo. In a xenograft model of a human NSCLC cell line containing the ALK rearrangement, we observe tumor regression at clinically relevant doses of IPI-504. Finally, cells that have been selected for resistance to ALK kinase inhibitors retain their sensitivity to IPI-504. We have recently observed partial responses to administration of IPI-504 as a single agent in a phase 2 clinical trial in patients with NSCLC, specifically in patients that carry an ALK rearrangement. This study provides a molecular explanation for these clinical observations."
https://openalex.org/W2008793606,"REST transcription factor is a master regulator of neural stem and progenitor cells, which is subjected to ubiquitylation-mediated proteasomal degradation during differentiation. In progenitor cells, degradation is inhibited by the action of the deubiquitylase enzyme HAUSP to prevent untimely neuronal differentiation. The repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST) functions as a master regulator to maintain neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs). REST undergoes proteasomal degradation through β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitylation during neuronal differentiation. However, reciprocal mechanisms that stabilize REST in NPCs are undefined. Here we show that the deubiquitylase HAUSP counterbalances REST ubiquitylation and prevents NPC differentiation. HAUSP expression declines concordantly with REST on neuronal differentiation and reciprocally with β-TrCP levels. HAUSP knockdown in NPCs decreases REST and induces differentiation. In contrast, HAUSP overexpression upregulates REST by overriding β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitylation. A consensus site (310-PYSS-313) in human REST is required for HAUSP-mediated REST deubiquitylation. Furthermore, REST overexpression in NPCs rescues the differentiation phenotype induced by HAUSP knockdown. These data demonstrate that HAUSP stabilizes REST through deubiquitylation and antagonizes β-TrCP in regulating REST at the post-translational level. Thus, HAUSP-mediated deubiquitylation represents a critical regulatory mechanism involved in the maintenance of NPCs."
https://openalex.org/W1979759042,"In mammals, the osmolality of the extracellular fluid (ECF) is highly stable despite radical changes in salt/water intake and excretion. Afferent systems are required to detect hypo- or hyperosmotic shifts in the ECF to trigger homeostatic control of osmolality. In humans, a pressor reflex is triggered by simply drinking water which may be mediated by peripheral osmoreceptors. Here, we identified afferent neurons in the thoracic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of mice that innervate hepatic blood vessels and detect physiological hypo-osmotic shifts in blood osmolality. Hepatic sensory neurons are equipped with an inward current that faithfully transduces graded changes in osmolality within the physiological range (~15 mOsm). In mice lacking the osmotically activated ion channel, TRPV4, hepatic sensory neurons no longer exhibit osmosensitive inward currents and activation of peripheral osmoreceptors in vivo is abolished. We have thus identified a new population of sensory neurons that transduce ongoing changes in hepatic osmolality."

Whether and how the ligases themselves are modified by cellular signaling is unclear. Here we report that protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of Smad Ubiquitin Regulatory Factor 1 (Smurf1) can switch its substrate preference between two proteins of opposing actions on axon development. Extracellular factors that promote axon formation elevated Smurf1 phosphorylation at a PKA site Thr306, and preventing this phosphorylation reduced axon formation in cultured hippocampal neurons and impaired polarization of cortical neurons in vivo. Thr306-phosphorylation changed the relative affinities of Smurf1 for its substrates, leading to reduced degradation of polarity protein Par6 and increased degradation of growth-inhibiting RhoA. Thus, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the E3 ligase could switch its substrate preference, contributing to selective protein degradation required for localized cellular function.

Extracellular factors that promote axon formation elevated Smurf1 phosphorylation at a PKA site Thr306, and preventing this phosphorylation reduced axon formation in cultured hippocampal neurons and impaired polarization of cortical neurons in vivo. Thr306-phosphorylation changed the relative affinities of Smurf1 for its substrates, leading to reduced degradation of polarity protein Par6 and increased degradation of growth-inhibiting RhoA. Thus, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the E3 ligase could switch its substrate preference, contributing to selective protein degradation required for localized cellular function. PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Smurf1 at Thr306 switches its substrate preference Axon-promoting factors elevate Smurf1 phosphorylation at Thr306 Smurf1 phosphorylation at Thr306 enhanced Par6 stabilization and RhoA degradation Selective protein degradation contributes to axon formation. A critical step in neuronal differentiation is the establishment of axon/dendrite polarity. An undifferentiated neurite may acquire the axon identity through either intrinsic or extrinsic factors. Postmitotic asymmetry in the distribution of cytoplasmic components (e.g., the centrosome; de Anda et al., 2005de Anda F.C. Pollarolo G. Da Silva J.S. Camoletto P.G. Feiguin F. Dotti C.G. Centrosome localization determines neuronal polarity.Nature. 2005; 436: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), could specify the location of axon initiation. Gradients of extracellular polarizing factors may also induce asymmetric localization or stabilization of cytoplasmic axon determinants, e.g., PI3 kinase (Menager et al., 2004Menager C. Arimura N.

However, spontaneous polarization of cultured hippocampal neurons occurs on apparently uniform substrate in the absence of extracellular polarizing signals (Dotti and Banker, 1987Dotti C.G. Banker G.A. Experimentally induced alteration in the polarity of developing neurons.Nature. 1987; 330: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In this case, a single axon emerges from a group of similar neurites, presumably as a result of intrinsic cytoplasmic polarity or stochastic accumulation of axon determinants, followed by a local positive feedback mechanism that stabilizes their accumulation (Blumer and Cooper, 2003Blumer K.J. Cooper J.A. Go ahead, break my symmetry!.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1048-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, Shelly et al., 2007Shelly M. Cancedda L. Heilshorn S. Sumbre G. Poo M.M. LKB1/STRAD promotes axon initiation during neuronal polarization.Cell. 2007; 129: 565-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms for stable accumulation of a protein is to reduce its degradation by lowering local activity of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Enhanced degradation of axon-promoting protein Rap1B-GTPase by overexpressing its specific E3 ligase Smurf2 prevented axon formation (Schwamborn et al., 2007bSchwamborn J.C. Muller M. Becker A.H. Puschel A.W. Ubiquitination of the GTPase Rap1B by the ubiquitin ligase Smurf2 is required for the establishment of neuronal polarity.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1410-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, whether regulation of endogenous E3 ligase activity contributes to axon formation remains unclear. The mammalian Par (partitioning-defective) proteins are key cytoplasmic components for axon formation. The accumulation of Par3 and Par6 at the tip of developing axon is essential for axon differentiation in hippocampal neurons (Shi et al., 2003Shi S.H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Hippocampal neuronal polarity specified by spatially localized mPar3/mPar6 and PI 3-kinase activity.Cell. 2003; 112: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The Par3/Par6/atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) complex was originally shown to be required for the anterior/posterior polarity of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo and for the polarization of Drosophila neuroblasts and epithelial cells (Nelson and Grindstaff, 1997Nelson W.J.

The Par6 and aPKC may also regulate dendritic spine morphogenesis by inactivating growth-disrupting RhoA (Sordella and Van Aelst, 2008Sordella R. Van Aelst L.

In epithelial cells, Par6 recruits an E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 (Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor1) that targets RhoA for localized ubiquitin-mediated degradation, facilitating disruption of tight junctions and polarized cell migration (Ozdamar et al., 2005Ozdamar B. Bose R. Barrios-Rodiles M. Wang H.R. Zhang Y. Wrana J.L.

Mice with either Smurf1 or Smurf2 gene deletion did not show overt embryo phenotype, but those with deletion of both genes display planar cell polarity defects in the cochlea and failure in neural tube closure, and die around E10.5, suggesting functional redundancy between Smurf1 and Smurf2 (Narimatsu et al., 2009Narimatsu M.

The mechanism that causes localized accumulation of Par6-associated complexes and the relationship between extracellular polarizing factors and Smurf1-mediated protein degradation in developing neurons are unknown. In the present study, we obtained direct evidence that regulation of UPS-dependent degradation of selective proteins occurs during axon initiation induced by cyclic AMP (cAMP) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin known to promote axon formation (Arimura and Kaibuchi, 2007Arimura N. Kaibuchi K. Neuronal polarity: from extracellular signals to intracellular mechanisms.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, Shelly et al., 2007Shelly M. Cancedda L. Heilshorn S. Sumbre G. Poo M.M. LKB1/STRAD promotes axon initiation during neuronal polarization.Cell. 2007; 129: 565-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We found that the axon initiation effect of cAMP/BDNF depended in part on PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the E3 ligase Smurf1, a process that resulted in enhanced Par6 stabilization and RhoA degradation. Biochemical assays showed that PKA-dependent Smurf1 phosphorylation at Thr306 increased the affinity of Smurf1 for RhoA relative to Par6. Furthermore, Smurf1 phosphorylation at Thr306 contributes significantly to axon formation in vitro and neuronal polarization in vivo. Together, these findings demonstrate a regulatory mechanism of UPS-dependent protein degradation through phosphorylation of the E3 ligase. Localized cAMP elevation caused by extracellular polarizing factor may trigger PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Smurf1 in an undifferentiated neurite, leading to differential stability of proteins that promote axon development. Selective accumulation of key protein determinants in an immature neurite is responsible for axon initiation triggered by either intrinsic cytoplasmic activity or extracellular polarizing factors. Such accumulation could result from localized inhibition of proteasome-dependent degradation (UPS) of selective proteins. Previous studies on cultured hippocampal neurons have shown that localized exposure of an undifferentiated neurite to BDNF or a cAMP analog promotes its differentiation into axon (Shelly et al., 2007Shelly M. Cancedda L. Heilshorn S. Sumbre G. Poo M.M. LKB1/STRAD promotes axon initiation during neuronal polarization.Cell. 2007; 129: 565-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In this study, we first showed that axon initiation could be preferentially induced on substrate stripes coated with BDNF or a cAMP analog (see Experimental Procedures; see Figures S1A1−S1A6 available online), and that global inhibition of UPS by MG132 promoted the formation of multiple axons in these neurons (Figure S1B), consistent with previous reports (Schwamborn et al., 2007bSchwamborn J.C. Muller M. Becker A.H. Puschel A.W. Ubiquitination of the GTPase Rap1B by the ubiquitin ligase Smurf2 is required for the establishment of neuronal polarity.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1410-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, Yan et al., 2006Yan D. Guo L. Wang Y. Requirement of dendritic Akt degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system for neuronal polarity.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that preferential axon initiation induced by the BDNF/cAMP-coated substrate stripes was prevented by bath application of the UPS inhibitor MG132 (1 μM) and mimicked by using stripes coated with either MG132 or another UPS inhibitor lactacystin (Figure S1A7). Thus, a nonspecific manipulation of UPS-dependent protein degradation could markedly influence both spontaneous and polarizing factor-induced axon formation. As described below, more specific manipulation of UPS via changes in the E3 ligase activity provides more specific dissection of the proteins involved in axon formation. We then examined the effects of BDNF or dibutyryl(db)-cAMP, a membrane permeant analog of cAMP, on the UPS-dependent degradation of five proteins that are known to be involved in axon differentiation and growth: partitioning-defective 6 (Par6), atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), Akt/PKB, liver kinase B1 (LKB1), and small GTPase RhoA (Arimura and Kaibuchi, 2007Arimura N.

We found that 10 hr incubation of hippocampal neurons with BDNF (50 ng/ml) or db-cAMP (20 μM) selectively increased the level of Par6 and LKB1 as well as decreased the level of RhoA, without affecting that of aPKC and Akt (Figure 1A ). On the other hand, general inhibition of UPS with MG132 (1 μM for 10 hr) markedly increased the level of all five proteins (Figure 1A). These changes induced by db-cAMP/BDNF were due to modulation of protein degradation rather than synthesis, because they were not affected by the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 μg/ml, data not shown). The protein stabilization effects of BDNF were also prevented by the specific PKA inhibitor KT5720 (200 nM) (Figure 1A), consistent with the involvement of PKA in BDNF-induced growth cone guidance (Gallo et al., 2002Gallo G.

Furthermore, we performed ubiquitination assay on Par6, LKB1, Akt, and RhoA, by transfecting myc-tagged ubiquitin in cultured Neuro2a cells, which exhibited the high transfection efficiency required for this assay. We found that 10 hr treatment of these Neuro2a cells with db-cAMP (20 μM) in the presence of MG132 (1 μM, to block ongoing UPS activity) led to a reduced ubiquitination of Par6 and LKB1 but enhanced RhoA ubiquitination, without affecting Akt ubiquitination (Figure 1B). Pretreatment of KT-5720 also diminished the changes of endogenous Par6 and RhoA protein level induced by BDNF or db-cAMP (see Figure S1C), Together, these findings show that BDNF and db-cAMP could induce a PKA-dependent selective stabilization and degradation of proteins relevant to axon formation, through its effects on the UPS activity. During axon/dendrite differentiation in cultured hippocampal neurons, Par6 accumulates at the axon tip and forms a complex with Par3 and aPKC (Shi et al., 2003Shi S.H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N.

To determine how BDNF modulates UPS-dependent Par6 degradation, we screened E3 ligases that are responsible for Par6 ubiquitination by cotransfecting Neuro2a cells with Par6 and various E3 ligases. The Par6 was overexpressed to avoid the possibility that the low endogenous level of Par6 becomes limiting in ubiquitination assays. We found that coexpression with the wild-type Smurf1 (Smurf1WT, Ozdamar et al., 2005Ozdamar B. Bose R. Barrios-Rodiles M. Wang H.R. Zhang Y. Wrana J.L. Regulation of the polarity protein Par6 by TGFbeta receptors controls epithelial cell plasticity.Science. 2005; 307: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) significantly enhanced Par6 ubiquitination, whereas coexpression with the ligase-deficient form of Smurf1 (Smurf1C699A, with the catalytic site Cys699 mutated to alanine; Zhu et al., 1999Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. A SMAD ubiquitin ligase targets the BMP pathway and affects embryonic pattern formation.Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) suppressed Par6 ubiquitination (Figure 2A ). In contrast, coexpression with Nedd4-1, Mdm2, Smurf2, or the ligase-deficient mutant of each of these ligases (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) all had no effect on Par6 ubiquitination (Figure 2A). Furthermore, bath application of db-cAMP (for 6 hr) in hippocampal cultures markedly increased the Par6 level in control untransfected or Smurf1WT-transfected cultures, but not in cultures transfected with Smurf1C699A (see Figure S2A). Thus, the ligase activity of Smurf1 is critical for its regulation of the Par6 level. Whether Smurf1 directly ubiquitinates Par6 was examined by using a cell-free in vitro ubiquitination assay. We found that the bacterial-purified Par6 was ubiquitinated only when all necessary components were present together with Smurf1WT but not with the ligase-deficient Smurf1C699A (Figure 2B). Consistent with the notion that Par6 and RhoA are specific substrates of Smurf1, downregulating Smurf1 expression with shRNA in Neuro2a cells (see Figure S3A) led to an increased level of Par6 and RhoA, but not of LKB1 (Figure S3A). Furthermore, the effect of BDNF/db-cAMP on Par6 ubiquitination and protein level was also diminished when Neuro2a cells were cotransfected with Smurf1C699A (Figure 2C; see also Figure S2A), similar to that found for RhoA (see Figure S2B). This further suggests the important role of Smurf1 in the BDNF/db-cAMP-induced Par6 stabilization. Similarly, coexpression of the Smurf1-resistant form of RhoA (RhoAK7,6R; see also Figure S2C; Ozdamar et al., 2005Ozdamar B. Bose R. Barrios-Rodiles M. Wang H.R. Zhang Y. Wrana J.L. Regulation of the polarity protein Par6 by TGFbeta receptors controls epithelial cell plasticity.Science. 2005; 307: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) prevented the enhanced ubiquitination effect of BDNF/db-cAMP (Figure 2D). Therefore, Par6 is not only an adaptor for Smurf1, as found in epithelial cells (Ozdamar et al., 2005Ozdamar B. Bose R. Barrios-Rodiles M. Wang H.R. Zhang Y. Wrana J.L. Regulation of the polarity protein Par6 by TGFbeta receptors controls epithelial cell plasticity.Science. 2005; 307: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2003Wang H.R. Zhang Y. Ozdamar B. Ogunjimi A.A. Alexandrova E. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Regulation of cell polarity and protrusion formation by targeting RhoA for degradation.Science. 2003; 302: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), but also is a specific substrate of Smurf1 in neurons, similar to RhoA. Notably, BDNF and db-cAMP modulate Smurf1-mediated ubiquitination of these two proteins in an opposite manner—increasing ubiquitination of RhoA but decreasing that of Par6. To understand the mechanism underlying the opposite regulation of Par6 and RhoA by BDNF/cAMP, we examined whether Smurf1 and/or its substrates are phosphorylated in response to BDNF or db-cAMP in Neuro2a cells. Western blotting showed that BDNF or db-cAMP treatment (for 30 s) did not change the level of the phosphorylated form of either Par6 or RhoA (data not shown), but markedly increased the level of phosphorylated Smurf1, an effect prevented by the presence of KT5720 (Figure 3A ). Furthermore, coexpression of Par6 together with a mutated Smurf1 that had a serine/threonine to alanine mutation at one of the five potential PKA sites (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) showed that only Smurf1T306A-expressing cells failed to exhibit prominent cAMP-induced Smurf1 phosphorylation and BDNF-induced reduction of Par6 ubiquitination (Figure 3B; see also Figure S4A). Thus, Smurf1 phosphorylation at Thr306 is critical for its ligase activity on Par6. In contrast to the role of Smurf1 in Par6 stabilization, we found that LKB1 stabilization induced by db-cAMP/BDNF could be attributed to PKA-dependent LKB1 phosphorylation at Ser431, a process that reduced LKB1 ubiquitination (Figure S4B). How does Smurf1 phosphorylation at Thr306 lead to the opposite regulation of Par6 and RhoA degradation? Further studies of Par6 and RhoA ubiquitination in Neuro2a cells (in the absence of MG132) showed that Par6 ubiquitination was markedly higher in cells expressing phosphorylation-resistant Smurf1T306A, but lower in cells expressing phosphorylation-mimicking Smurf1T306D, in comparison with that in Smurf1WT-expressing cells (Figure 3C). Interestingly, RhoA ubiquitination exhibited the opposite pattern in these cells (Figure 3C). Moreover, treatment with db-cAMP or BDNF resulted in opposite changes in the level of Par6 and RhoA that are consistent with those found by expressing Smurf1T306D or Smurf1T306A (Figure 3D). Together, these results showed that Smurf1 phosphorylation at Thr306 alters its substrate preference from Par6 to RhoA without compromising its E3 ligase function, leading to elevated ratio of Par6 to RhoA (Figure 3D). This switch of substrate preference was due to changes in the relative affinities of Thr306-phosphorylated Smurf1 (p-Smurf1T306) for these two proteins. Western blotting of immunoprecipitated Smurf1 from Neuro2a cells expressing Smurf1WT showed that elevated Smurf1 phosphorylation induced by BDNF or db-cAMP was accompanied by an increased level of Smurf1-bound RhoA and a reduced level of Smurf1-bound Par6 (Figure 3E). Consistently, Smurf1T306D exhibited higher RhoA binding but lower Par6 binding than either Smurf1WT or Smurf1T306A (Figure 3E). Thus, Smurf1 phosphorylation at Thr306 resulted in a switch of the substrate preference from Par6 to RhoA, leading to opposite changes of ubiquitination and degradation of these two proteins. The subcellular distribution of p-Smurf1T306 was further investigated by using a phospho-specific antibody (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) that recognizes phosphorylated Thr306 of Smurf1, and antibody specificity was confirmed by the reduction of staining intensity in the presence of a phospho-peptide that contains phospho-Thr306 (Figure S5A). Western blotting of immunoprecipitated endogenous Smurf1 from hippocampal neurons using this antibody showed an elevation of p-Smurf1T306 induced by bath application of BDNF, db-cAMP, or forskolin (Figure 4A ). Immunostaining of hippocampal neurons in 16 hr culture prior to axon differentiation showed that p-Smurf1T306 often accumulated unequally in undifferentiated neurites (54 of 75), in contrast to a more uniform distribution of Smurf1 (Figure 4B). When p-Smurf1T306 immunostaining was normalized by that for Smurf1 for the first four longest neurites, we observed up to ∼3-fold difference in p-Smurf1T306 accumulation among neurites of similar length (Figure 4B). Localized contact of the neurite with BDNF, which was coated on either the culture substrate in stripes by adsorption or the surface latex bead via covalent bonding, induced localized accumulation of p-Smurf1T306 in neurites at the contact sites (Figures 4C and 4D). Furthermore, for neurons in 1-DIV cultures that are undergoing axon/dendrite differentiation, more prominent p-Smurf1T306 accumulation was observed (Figure S5B). We measured the immunostaining of endogenous Par6, RhoA, and p-Smurf1T306 in neurons that had the longest neurite, >2-fold longer than the rest (most likely to become the axon), and found that the cytoplasmic distribution of p-Smurf1T306 correlated well with that of Par6, especially near the growth cone region, where RhoA exhibited a conspicuous reduction (Figure S5C). In contrast, no apparent accumulation of either p-Smurf1T306 or Par6 was found along the shortest neurite of the same group of neurons (Figure S5C). These measurements revealed a significantly higher ratio of PAR6/RhoA level at the growth cone of the neurite that is most likely to become the axon (Figure S5D). Finally, for 3-DIV neurons that had completed axon/dendrite differentiation, we found clear accumulation of p-Smurf1T306 staining in the axon, together with Par6 (Figure 4E). These findings support the notion that Smurf1 phosphorylation at Thr306 reduces Par6 degradation and increases RhoA degradation locally at the growth cone of the neurite at the time of its axon differentiation, and that p-Smurf1T306 accumulation persists in newly polarized axons that are undergoing rapid axonal growth. We further examined whether RhoA regulation is indeed important for spontaneous and BDNF-induced axon differentiation in cultured hippocampal neurons. We found that inhibition of Rho kinase (ROCK) activity with bath application of the specific inhibitor Y-27632 marked increased the percentage of neurons with multiple axons (MA) and the average length of neurites in these hippocampal neurons (Figures 5A1−5A4), consistent with a previous report (Da Silva et al., 2003Da Silva J.S. Medina M. Zuliani C. Di Nardo A. Witke W. Dotti C.G. RhoA/ROCK regulation of neuritogenesis via profilin IIa-mediated control of actin stability.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1267-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of a constitutively active form of RhoA (Rho-CA; Renshaw et al., 1996Renshaw M.W. Toksoz D. Schwartz M.A. Involvement of the small GTPase rho in integrin-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21691-21694Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) completely abolished neurite formation in these neurons (Figures 5A2 and 5A4). Furthermore, expression of the Smurf1-resistant RhoAK6,7R, which resists UPS-dependent degradation, increased the percentage of cells with no axon (NA), reduced that with MA, and shortened the average axon length in cells with a single axon (SA) (Figures 5A3 and 5A4). Thus, RhoA activity inhibits axon formation. The ROCK effect was also reflected by hippocampal neurons cultured on the substrate stripe-coated"
https://openalex.org/W2048601897,"As an established mediator of inflammation, interleukin-6 (IL-6) is implicated to facilitate prostate cancer progression to androgen independence through transactivation of the androgen receptor. However, whether IL-6 has a causative role in de novo prostate tumorigenesis was never investigated. We now provide the first evidence that IL-6 can induce tumorigenic conversion and further progression to an invasive phenotype of non-tumorigenic benign prostate epithelial cells. Moreover, we find that paracrine IL-6 stimulates the autocrine IL-6 loop and autocrine activation of insulin-like type I growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) to confer the tumorigenic property and also that activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is critical in these processes. Inhibition of STAT3 activation or IGF-IR signaling suppresses IL-6-mediated malignant conversion and the associated invasive phenotype. Inhibition of STAT3 activation suppresses IL-6-induced upregulation of IGF-IR and its ligands, namely IGF-I and IGF-II. These findings indicate that IL-6 signaling cooperates with IGF-IR signaling in the prostate microenvironment to promote prostate tumorigenesis and progression to aggressiveness. Our findings suggest that STAT3 and IGF-IR may represent potential effective targets for prevention or treatment of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2138433638,"Antonio Giraldez and colleagues report that miRNA-mediated regulation of the sdf1 chemokine signaling pathway in zebrafish provides genetic robustness to germ cell migration. microRNAs (miRNAs) function as genetic rheostats to control gene output. Based on their role as modulators, it has been postulated that miRNAs canalize development and provide genetic robustness. Here, we uncover a previously unidentified regulatory layer of chemokine signaling by miRNAs that confers genetic robustness on primordial germ cell (PGC) migration. In zebrafish, PGCs are guided to the gonad by the ligand Sdf1a, which is regulated by the sequestration receptor Cxcr7b. We find that miR-430 regulates sdf1a and cxcr7 mRNAs. Using target protectors, we demonstrate that miR-430–mediated regulation of endogenous sdf1a (also known as cxcl12a) and cxcr7b (i) facilitates dynamic expression of sdf1a by clearing its mRNA from previous expression domains, (ii) modulates the levels of the decoy receptor Cxcr7b to avoid excessive depletion of Sdf1a and (iii) buffers against variation in gene dosage of chemokine signaling components to ensure accurate PGC migration. Our results indicate that losing miRNA-mediated regulation can expose otherwise buffered genetic lesions leading to developmental defects."
https://openalex.org/W2003695991,"Hyperglycemia is associated with greater hematoma expansion and poor clinical outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage. We show that cerebral hematoma expansion triggered by intracerebral infusion of autologous blood is greater in diabetic rats and mice compared to nondiabetic controls and that this augmented expansion is ameliorated by plasma kallikrein (PK) inhibition or deficiency. Intracerebral injection of purified PK augmented hematoma expansion in both diabetic and acutely hyperglycemic rats, whereas injection of bradykinin, plasmin or tissue plasminogen activator did not elicit such a response. This response, which occurs rapidly, was prevented by co-injection of the glycoprotein VI agonist convulxin and was mimicked by glycoprotein VI inhibition or deficiency, implicating an effect of PK on inhibiting platelet aggregation. We show that PK inhibits collagen-induced platelet aggregation by binding collagen, a response enhanced by elevated glucose concentrations. The effect of hyperglycemia on hematoma expansion and PK-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation could be mimicked by infusing mannitol. These findings suggest that hyperglycemia augments cerebral hematoma expansion by PK-mediated osmotic-sensitive inhibition of hemostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2024011783,"Myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (Mcl-1) is an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that is elevated in a variety of tumour types including breast cancer. In breast tumours, increased Mcl-1 expression correlates with high tumour grade and poor patient survival. We have previously demonstrated that Her-2 levels correspond to increased Mcl-1 expression in breast tumours. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signalling is frequently deregulated in breast cancer and leads to increased proliferation and survival. Herein, we determined the critical downstream signals responsible for the EGF mediated increase of Mcl-1 and their role in cell survival. We found that both Mcl-1 mRNA and protein levels are rapidly induced upon stimulation with EGF. Promoter analysis revealed that an Elk-1 transcription factor-binding site is critical for EGF activation of the Mcl-1 promoter. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of Elk-1or inhibition of the Erk signalling pathway was sufficient to block EGF upregulation of Mcl-1 and EGF mediated cell survival. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and biotin labelled probes of the Mcl-1 promoter, we found that Elk-1 and serum response factor are bound to the promoter after EGF stimulation. To determine whether Mcl-1 confers a survival advantage, we found that knockdown of Mcl-1 expression increased apoptosis whereas overexpression of Mcl-1 inhibited drug induced cell death. In human breast tumours, we found a correlation between phosphorylated Elk-1 and Mcl-1 protein levels. These results indicate that the EGF induced activation of Elk-1 is an important mediator of Mcl-1 expression and cell survival and therefore a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2062239697,"Casein kinase 1 delta and epsilon (CK1δ/ɛ) are key regulators of diverse cellular growth and survival processes including Wnt signaling, DNA repair and circadian rhythms. Recent studies suggest that they have an important role in oncogenesis. RNA interference screens identified CK1ɛ as a pro-survival factor in cancer cells in vitro and the CK1δ/ɛ-specific inhibitor IC261 is remarkably effective at selective, synthetic lethal killing of cancer cells. The recent development of the nanomolar CK1δ/ɛ-selective inhibitor, PF670462 (PF670) and the CK1ɛ-selective inhibitor PF4800567 (PF480) offers an opportunity to further test the role of CK1δ/ɛ in cancer. Unexpectedly, and unlike IC261, PF670 and PF480 were unable to induce cancer cell death. PF670 is a potent inhibitor of CK1δ/ɛ in cells; nanomolar concentrations are sufficient to inhibit CK1δ/ɛ activity as measured by repression of intramolecular autophosphorylation, phosphorylation of disheveled2 proteins and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Likewise, small interfering RNA knockdown of CK1δ and CK1ɛ reduced Wnt/β-catenin signaling without affecting cell viability, further suggesting that CK1δ/ɛ inhibition may not be relevant to the IC261-induced cell death. Thus, while PF670 is a potent inhibitor of Wnt signaling, it only modestly inhibits cell proliferation. In contrast, while sub-micromolar concentrations of IC261 neither inhibited CK1δ/ɛ kinase activity nor blocked Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cancer cells, it caused a rapid induction of prometaphase arrest and subsequent apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines. In a stepwise transformation model, IC261-induced killing required both overactive Ras and inactive p53. IC261 binds to tubulin with an affinity similar to colchicine and is a potent inhibitor of microtubule polymerization. This activity accounts for many of the diverse biological effects of IC261 and, most importantly, for its selective cancer cell killing."
https://openalex.org/W2080525519,"Ovarian cancer is highly metastatic with a poor prognosis. The serine/threonine kinase, p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), which is a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, is frequently activated in ovarian cancer. Here, we show that p70S6K is a critical regulator of the actin cytoskeleton in the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype. This regulation is through two important activities: p70S6K acts as an actin filament cross-linking protein and as a Rho family GTPase-activating protein. Ectopic expression of constitutively active p70S6K in ovarian cancer cells induced a marked reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and promoted directional cell migration. Using cosedimentation and differential sedimentation assays, p70S6K was found to directly bind to and cross-link actin filaments. Immunofluorescence studies showed p70S6K colocalized with cytochalasin D-sensitive actin at the leading edge of motile cells. The p70S6K did not affect the kinetics of spontaneous actin polymerization, but could stabilize actin filaments by the inhibition of cofilin-induced actin depolymerization. In addition, we showed that p70S6K stimulated the rapid activation of both Rac1 and Cdc42, and their downstream effector p21-activated kinase (PAK1), but not RhoA. Depletion of p70S6K expression or inhibition of its activity resulted in significant inhibition of actin cytoskeleton reorganization and reduced migration, with a concomitant reduction in Rac1, Cdc42 and PAK1 activation, confirming that the effect was p70S6K specific. Similarly, the actin cytoskeleton reorganization/migratory phenotype could be reversed by expression of dominant negative Rac1 and Cdc42, or inhibition of PAK1. These results reveal a new direction for understanding the oncogenic roles of p70S6K in tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2091400173,"MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein which is typically expressed at the apical membrane of normal epithelial cells. In cancer cells, the over-expression of MUC1 and its aberrant localization around the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm favours its interaction with different protein partners such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and can promote tumour proliferation through the activation of oncogenic signalling pathways. Our aims were to study the mechanisms inducing MUC1 cytoplasmic localization in pancreatic cancer cells, and to decipher their impact on EGFR cellular localization and activation. Our results showed that galectin-3, an endogenous lectin, is co-expressed with MUC1 in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and that it favours the endocytosis of MUC1 and EGFR. Depletion of galectin-3 by RNA interference increased the interaction between MUC1 and EGFR, EGFR and ERK-1,2 phosphorylation, and translocation of EGFR to the nucleus. On the contrary, silencing of galectin-3 led to a decrease of cyclin-D1 levels and of cell proliferation. The galectin-3-dependent regulation of MUC1/EGFR functions may represent an interesting mechanism modulating the EGFR-stimulated cell growth of pancreatic cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2025627627,"Glucocorticoids (GC) have important anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic activities. Initially thought to be exclusively produced by the adrenal glands, there is now increasing evidence for extra-adrenal sources of GCs. We have previously shown that the intestinal epithelium produces immunoregulatory GCs and that intestinal steroidogenesis is regulated by the nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1). As LRH-1 has been implicated in the development of colon cancer, we here investigated whether LRH-1 regulates GC synthesis in colorectal tumors and whether tumor-produced GCs suppress T-cell activation. Colorectal cancer cell lines and primary tumors were found to express steroidogenic enzymes and regulatory factors required for the de novo synthesis of cortisol. Both cell lines and primary tumors constitutively produced readily detectable levels of cortisol, as measured by radioimmunoassay, thin-layer chromatography and bioassay. Whereas overexpression of LRH-1 significantly increased the expression of steroidogenic enzymes and the synthesis of cortisol, downregulation or inhibition of LRH-1 effectively suppressed these processes, indicating an important role of LRH-1 in colorectal tumor GC synthesis. An immunoregulatory role of tumor-derived GCs could be further confirmed by demonstrating a suppression of T-cell activation. This study describes for the first time cortisol synthesis in a non-endocrine tumor in humans, and suggests that the synthesis of bioactive GCs in colon cancer cells may account as a novel mechanism of tumor immune escape."
https://openalex.org/W2033798173,"How the mitosis of neuroepithelial stem cells is restricted to the apical ventricular area remains unclear. In zebrafish, the mosaic eyesrw306 (moe/epb41l5rw306) mutation disrupts the interaction between the putative adaptor protein Moe and the apicobasal polarity regulator Crumbs (Crb), and impairs the maintenance of neuroepithelial apicobasal polarity. While Crb interacts directly with Notch and inhibits its activity, Moe reverses this inhibition. In the moerw306 hindbrain, Notch activity is significantly reduced, and the number of cells that proliferate basally away from the apical area is increased. Surprisingly, activation of Notch in the moerw306 mutant rescues not only the basally localized proliferation but also the aberrant neuroepithelial apicobasal polarity. We present evidence that the Crb⋅Moe complex and Notch play key roles in a positive feedback loop to maintain the apicobasal polarity and the apical-high basal-low gradient of Notch activity in neuroepithelial cells, both of which are essential for their apically restricted mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1985830991,"Ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms have emerged as essential regulatory elements controlling cellular levels of Smads and TGFβ-dependent biological outputs such as epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this study, we identify a HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase known as WWP2 (Full-length WWP2-FL), together with two WWP2 isoforms (N-terminal, WWP2-N; C-terminal WWP2-C), as novel Smad-binding partners. We show that WWP2-FL interacts exclusively with Smad2, Smad3 and Smad7 in the TGFβ pathway. Interestingly, the WWP2-N isoform interacts with Smad2 and Smad3, whereas WWP2-C interacts only with Smad7. In addition, WWP2-FL and WWP2-C have a preference for Smad7 based on protein turnover and ubiquitination studies. Unexpectedly, we also find that WWP2-N, which lacks the HECT ubiquitin ligase domain, can also interact with WWP2-FL in a TGFβ-regulated manner and activate endogenous WWP2 ubiquitin ligase activity causing degradation of unstimulated Smad2 and Smad3. Consistent with our protein interaction data, overexpression and knockdown approaches reveal that WWP2 isoforms differentially modulate TGFβ-dependent transcription and EMT. Finally, we show that selective disruption of WWP2 interactions with inhibitory Smad7 can stabilise Smad7 protein levels and prevent TGFβ-induced EMT. Collectively, our data suggest that WWP2-N can stimulate WWP2-FL leading to increased activity against unstimulated Smad2 and Smad3, and that Smad7 is a preferred substrate for WWP2-FL and WWP2-C following prolonged TGFβ stimulation. Significantly, this is the first report of an interdependent biological role for distinct HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase isoforms, and highlights an entirely novel regulatory paradigm that selectively limits the level of inhibitory and activating Smads."
https://openalex.org/W2045701552,"In spite of a large number of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1)-regulated genes, the nature of its targets with roles in transformation continues to be poorly understood. Here, we discovered that TGF-β1 stimulates transcription of metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1), a dual master coregulator, in epithelial cells, and that MTA1 status is a determinant of TGF-β1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes. In addition, we found that MTA1/polymerase II/activator protein-1 (AP-1) co-activator complex interacts with the FosB-gene chromatin and stimulates its transcription, and FosB in turn, utilizes FosB/histone deacetylase 2 complex to repress E-cadherin expression in TGF-β1-stimulated mammary epithelial cells. These findings suggest that TGF-β1 regulates the components of EMT via stimulating the expression of MTA1, which in turn, induces FosB to repress E-cadherin expression and thus, revealed an inherent function of MTA1 as a target and effector of TGF-β1 signaling in epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2040310469,"Accumulation of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels at nodes of Ranvier is paramount for action potential propagation along myelinated fibers, yet the mechanisms governing nodal development, organization, and stabilization remain unresolved. Here, we report that genetic ablation of the neuron-specific isoform of Neurofascin (NfascNF186) in vivo results in nodal disorganization, including loss of Nav channel and ankyrin-G (AnkG) enrichment at nodes in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). Interestingly, the presence of paranodal domains failed to rescue nodal organization in the PNS and the CNS. Most importantly, using ultrastructural analysis, we demonstrate that the paranodal domains invade the nodal space in NfascNF186 mutant axons and occlude node formation. Our results suggest that NfascNF186-dependent assembly of the nodal complex acts as a molecular boundary to restrict the movement of flanking paranodal domains into the nodal area, thereby facilitating the stereotypic axonal domain organization and saltatory conduction along myelinated axons."
https://openalex.org/W2051535801,"The protein kinase encoded by the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) gene is activated by DNA-damaging agents that are frequently used as anticancer therapeutics. Inhibition of ATR expression in cultured cancer cells has been demonstrated to increase sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, including the DNA-crosslinking agent cisplatin. Cisplatin is a widely used and effective drug, but its use is associated with significant toxicity. Here, we demonstrate that genetic inhibition of ATR expression selectively enhanced cisplatin sensitivity in human colorectal cancer cells with inactivated p53. A knock-in strategy was used to restore wild-type p53 in cells harboring wild-type or mutant ATR alleles. Knock-in of functional p53 in ATR-deficient cells restored checkpoint function, suppressed apoptotic pathways and markedly increased clonogenic survival after cisplatin treatment. These results suggest that a strategy that combines specific inhibitors of ATR and conventional therapies might promote synthetic lethality in p53-deficient tumors, and thus minimize toxicity to normal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2027136237,"Dendrites, axons, and synapses are dynamic during circuit development; however, changes in microcircuit connections as branches stabilize have not been directly demonstrated. By combining in vivo time-lapse imaging of Xenopus tectal neurons with electron microscope reconstructions of imaged neurons, we report the distribution and ultrastructure of synapses on individual vertebrate neurons and relate these synaptic properties to dynamics in dendritic and axonal arbor structure over hours or days of imaging. Dynamic dendrites have a high density of immature synapses, whereas stable dendrites have sparser, mature synapses. Axons initiate contacts from multisynapse boutons on stable branches. Connections are refined by decreasing convergence from multiple inputs to postsynaptic dendrites and by decreasing divergence from multisynapse boutons to postsynaptic sites. Visual deprivation or NMDAR antagonists decreased synapse maturation and elimination, suggesting that coactive input activity promotes microcircuit development by concurrently regulating synapse elimination and maturation of remaining contacts."
https://openalex.org/W2158277425,"Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome is an inherited cancer susceptibility disease characterized by skin and kidney tumors, as well as cystic lung disease, which results from loss-of-function mutations in the BHD gene. BHD is also inactivated in a significant fraction of patients with sporadic renal cancers and idiopathic cystic lung disease, and little is known about its mode of action. To investigate the molecular and cellular basis of BHD tumor suppressor activity, we generated mutant Bhd mice and embryonic stem cell lines. BHD-deficient cells exhibited defects in cell-intrinsic apoptosis that correlated with reduced expression of the BH3-only protein Bim, which was similarly observed in all human and murine BHD-related tumors examined. We further demonstrate that Bim deficiency in Bhd(-/-) cells is not a consequence of elevated mTOR or ERK activity, but results instead from reduced Bim transcription associated with a general loss of TGFβ-mediated transcription and chromatin modifications. In aggregate, this work identifies a specific tumor suppressive mechanism for BHD in regulating TGFβ-dependent transcription and apoptosis, which has implications for the development of targeted therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2092793033,"Dantrolene is believed to stabilize interdomain interactions between the NH2-terminal and central regions of ryanodine receptors by binding to the NH2-terminal residues 590-609 in skeletal ryanodine receptor (RyR1) and residues 601-620 in cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2). To gain further insight into the structural basis of dantrolene action, we have attempted to localize the dantrolene-binding sequence in RyR1/RyR2 by using GFP as a structural marker and three-dimensional cryo-EM. We inserted GFP into RyR2 after residues Arg-626 and Tyr-846 to generate GFP-RyR2 fusion proteins, RyR2Arg-626-GFP and RyR2Tyr-846-GFP. Insertion of GFP after residue Arg-626 abolished the binding of a bulky GST- or cyan fluorescent protein-tagged FKBP12.6 but not the binding of a smaller, nontagged FKBP12.6, suggesting that residue Arg-626 and the dantrolene-binding sequence are located near the FKBP12.6-binding site. Using cryo-EM, we have mapped the three-dimensional location of Tyr-846-GFP to domain 9, which is also adjacent to the FKBP12.6-binding site. To further map the three-dimensional location of the dantrolene-binding sequence, we generated 10 FRET pairs based on four known three-dimensional locations (FKBP12.6, Ser-437-GFP, Tyr-846-GFP, and Ser-2367-GFP). Based on the FRET efficiencies of these FRET pairs and the corresponding distance relationships, we mapped the three-dimensional location of Arg-626-GFP or -cyan fluorescent protein, hence the dantrolene-binding sequence, to domain 9 near the FKBP12.6-binding site but distant to the central region around residue Ser-2367. An allosteric mechanism by which dantrolene stabilizes interdomain interactions between the NH2-terminal and central regions is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1970067193,"Neuronal networks exhibit a rich dynamical repertoire, a consequence of both the intrinsic properties of neurons and the structure of the network. It has been hypothesized that inhibitory interneurons corral principal neurons into transiently synchronous ensembles that encode sensory information and subserve behavior. How does the structure of the inhibitory network facilitate such spatiotemporal patterning? We established a relationship between an important structural property of a network, its colorings, and the dynamics it constrains. Using a model of the insect antennal lobe, we show that our description allows the explicit identification of the groups of inhibitory interneurons that switch, during odor stimulation, between activity and quiescence in a coordinated manner determined by features of the network structure. This description optimally matches the perspective of the downstream neurons looking for synchrony in ensembles of presynaptic cells and allows a low-dimensional description of seemingly complex high-dimensional network activity."
https://openalex.org/W2115941827,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a principal regulator of angiogenesis and other cellular responses to hypoxic stress in both normal and tumor cells. To identify novel mechanisms that regulate expression of HIF-1α, we designed a genome-wide screen for expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that when transcribed in the antisense direction increase production of the HIF-1α target, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in human breast cancer cells. We discovered that heat shock factor (HSF) proteins 2 and 4-which previously have been implicated in the control of multiple genes that modulate cell growth and differentiation and protect against effects of environmental and cellular stresses-function together to maintain a steady state level of HIF-1α transcription and VEGF production in these cells. We show both HSFs bind to discontinuous heat shock element (HSE) sequences we identified in the HIF-1α promoter region and that downregulation of either HSF activates transcription of HIF-1α. We further demonstrate that HSF2 and HSF4 displace each other from HSF/HSE complexes in the HIF-1α promoter so that HIF-1α transcription is also activated by overexpression of either HSFs. These results argue that HSF2 and HSF4 regulate transcription of HIF-1α and that a critical balance between these HSF is required to maintain HIF-α expression in a repressed state. Our findings reveal a previously unsuspected role for HSFs in control of VEGF and other genes activated by canonical HIF-1α-mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1981892091,"The tumor suppressor gene von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) is involved in the development of sporadic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). VHL interferes with angiogenesis and also controls cell adhesion and invasion. Therapies that target VHL-controlled genes are currently being evaluated in RCC patients. RCC is a immunogenic tumor and treatment with interleukin-2 (IL2) or interferon (IFN)-α results in regression in some patients. We used two renal tumor cell lines (RCC6 and RCC4) carrying VHL loss-of-function mutations to investigate the role of mutant VHL in susceptibility to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated lysis. The RCC6 and RCC4 cell lines were transfected with the wild-type gene to restore the function of VHL. The presence of the gene in RCC cells downregulated hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and subsequently decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. Relative to control transfectants and parental cells, pVHL-transfected cell lines activated resting and IL2-activated NK cells less strongly, as assessed by IFNγ secretion, NK degranulation and cell lysis. NKG2A, a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I-specific inhibitory NK receptor, controls the lysis of tumor targets. We show that HLA-I expression in RCC-pVHL cells is stronger than that in parental and controls cells, although the expression of activating receptor NK ligands remains unchanged. Blocking NKG2A/HLA-I interactions substantially increased lysis of RCC-pVHL, but had little effect on the lysis of VHL-mutated RCC cell lines. In addition, in response to IFNα, the exponential growth of RCC-pVHL was inhibited more than that of RCC-pE cells, indicating that VHL mutations may be involved in IFNα resistance. These results indicate that a decreased expression of HLA-I molecules in mutated VHL renal tumor cells sensitizes them to NK-mediated lysis. These results suggest that combined immunotherapy with anti-angiogenic drugs may be beneficial for patients with mutated VHL."
https://openalex.org/W1967205171,"We previously identified and characterized E2F-associated phospho-protein (EAPP), a nuclear phosphoprotein that interacts with the activating members of the E2F transcription factor family. EAPP levels are frequently elevated in transformed human cells. To examine the biological relevance of EAPP, we studied its properties in stressed and unstressed cells. Overexpression of EAPP in U2OS cells increased the fraction of G1 cells and lead to heightened resistance against DNA damage- or E2F1-induced apoptosis in a p21-dependent manner. EAPP itself becomes upregulated in confluent cells and after DNA damage and stimulates the expression of p21 independently of p53. It binds to the p21 promoter and seems to be required for the assembly of the transcription initiation complex. RNAi-mediated knockdown of EAPP expression brought about increased sensitivity towards DNA damage and resulted in apoptosis even in the absence of stress. Our results indicate that the level of EAPP is critical for cellular homeostasis. Too much of it results in G1 arrest and resistance to apoptosis, which, paradoxically, might favor cellular transformation. Too little EAPP seems to retard the expression not only of the p21 gene, but also of a number of other genes and ultimately results in apoptosis."
