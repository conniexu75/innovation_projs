https://openalex.org/W2770127492,"Efficient genome editing with Cas9-sgRNA in vivo has required the use of viral delivery systems, which have limitations for clinical applications. Translational efforts to develop other RNA therapeutics have shown that judicious chemical modification of RNAs can improve therapeutic efficacy by reducing susceptibility to nuclease degradation. Guided by the structure of the Cas9-sgRNA complex, we identify regions of sgRNA that can be modified while maintaining or enhancing genome-editing activity, and we develop an optimal set of chemical modifications for in vivo applications. Using lipid nanoparticle formulations of these enhanced sgRNAs (e-sgRNA) and mRNA encoding Cas9, we show that a single intravenous injection into mice induces >80% editing of Pcsk9 in the liver. Serum Pcsk9 is reduced to undetectable levels, and cholesterol levels are significantly lowered about 35% to 40% in animals. This strategy may enable non-viral, Cas9-based genome editing in the liver in clinical settings."

Despite recent advances in organoid-based modeling of tissue development, recapitulating these complex configurations from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) has remained challenging. In this study, we report assembly of kidney organoids that recapitulate embryonic branching morphogenesis. By studying the distinct origins and developmental processes of the ureteric bud, which contains epithelial kidney progenitors that undergo branching morphogenesis and thereby plays a central role in orchestrating organ geometry, and neighboring mesenchymal nephron progenitors, we established a protocol for differential induction of each lineage from mouse and human PSCs. Importantly, reassembled organoids developed the inherent architectures of the embryonic kidney, including the peripheral progenitor niche and internally differentiated nephrons that were interconnected by a ramified ureteric epithelium. This selective induction and reassembly strategy will be a powerful approach to recapitulate organotypic architecture in PSC-derived organoids."

Malaria remains one of the major global public health threats, with an estimated 200 million clinical cases and 429,000 deaths in 2015 (World Health Organization, 2016World Health Organization (2016). World Malaria Report 2016.Google Scholar). Mature Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes are the only stage of the malaria parasite able to establish an infection in the Anopheles mosquito vector. Therefore, gametocyte formation and maturation are critical steps for successful parasite dissemination in the human population, and major targets of the ongoing malaria elimination agenda (Nilsson et al., 2015Nilsson S.K. Childs L.M. Buckee C. Marti M. Targeting Human Transmission Biology for Malaria Elimination.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11: e1004871Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Gametocyte densities vary during infection and increase with disease progression, in particular during anemia (Joice et al., 2014Joice R. Nilsson S.K. Montgomery J. Dankwa S. Egan E. Morahan B.

In contrast to asexual stages, the transmissible gametocyte forms are non-proliferative and appear largely quiescent during their development in bone marrow and spleen (Nilsson et al., 2015Nilsson S.K. Childs L.M. Buckee C. Marti M. Targeting Human Transmission Biology for Malaria Elimination.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11: e1004871Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Successful parasite transmission therefore requires balancing the investments in asexual reproduction and gametocyte formation under variable host conditions (Reece et al., 2009Reece S.E. Ramiro R.S.

Various parameters have been proposed to affect the rate at which gametocytes are produced, including host cell age (Peatey et al., 2013Peatey C.L. Watson J.A. Trenholme K.R. Brown C.L. Nielson L.

On a molecular level, gametocyte formation depends on activation of a stage-specific transcription factor, AP2-G, marking the first known step in sexual differentiation of malaria parasites (Kafsack et al., 2014Kafsack B.F.

Sexual differentiation is generally repressed by the co-operative action of histone deacetylase 2 (HDA2) and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)—two epigenetic factors required for keeping the ap2-g locus in its silenced state (Brancucci et al., 2014Brancucci N.M.B.

Upon expression, AP2-G acts as a transcriptional master switch that induces commitment to the sexual pathway and irreversibly primes the cell for gametocyte development in the following intra-erythrocytic cycle (Kafsack et al., 2014Kafsack B.F. Rovira-Graells N. Clark T.G. Bancells C. Crowley V.M. Campino S.G. Williams A.E. Drought L.G. Kwiatkowski D.P.

While sexual conversion rates vary across strains and conditions and the transcriptional program activated by AP2-G has been characterized in some detail, no external signals or upstream factors regulating the epigenetic control of ap2-g have been identified. Here we examined how parasite populations regulate entry into the sexual pathway. We used an in vitro assay designed to probe the effect of culture perturbations on gametocyte formation (Brancucci et al., 2015Brancucci N.M. Goldowitz I. Buchholz K. Werling K. Marti M.

A high-throughput screen targeting malaria transmission stages opens new avenues for drug development.J. Infect. Dis. 2011; 203: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and discovered a serum factor that provides malaria parasites with essential nutrients and controls sexual commitment upstream of AP2-G. Our data reveal the existence of a dynamic crosstalk between P. falciparum metabolism and gene regulation and pave the way for systematic dissection of the pathways translating environmental sensing into epigenetic remodeling, ap2-g activation, and parasite differentiation. Exposing parasites to spent or “parasite-conditioned” medium (CM) dramatically induces sexual commitment relative to fresh medium complemented with human serum (+SerM) (Brancucci et al., 2015Brancucci N.M. Goldowitz I. Buchholz K. Werling K. Marti M. An assay to probe Plasmodium falciparum growth, transmission stage formation and early gametocyte development.Nat.

Stimulation of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytogenesis by conditioned medium from parasite cultures.Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1999; 60: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Based on these data, it was hypothesized that CM was either enriched in specific secreted parasite factors or depleted of specific host components. In favor of the former hypothesis, we have recently demonstrated that extracellular vesicles (EVs) from CM can increase sexual commitment rates (Mantel et al., 2013Mantel P.Y. Hoang A.N. Goldowitz I. Potashnikova D. Hamza B. Vorobjev I. Ghiran I. Toner M. Irimia D. Ivanov A.R. et al.Malaria-infected erythrocyte-derived microvesicles mediate cellular communication within the parasite population and with the host immune system.Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 13: 521-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Further experiments confirmed that EVs can induce parasite differentiation when applied at high concentrations (Figure 1A). However, CM retains most of its activity after EVs have been depleted from the medium (Figure 1B), suggesting that vesicles are not essential for gametocyte formation. Conversely, we found that the addition of serum is sufficient to reverse the commitment-inducing effect of CM. Consistent with a model in which gametocyte formation is triggered in response to restricted host factor availability, sexual commitment could be induced by exposing parasites to a serum-free medium (−SerM) (Figure 1C). In −SerM, human serum is substituted by bovine serum albumin and a minimal set of fatty acids required for parasite survival (Mi-Ichi et al., 2007Mi-Ichi F. Kano S. Mitamura T. Oleic acid is indispensable for intraerythrocytic proliferation of Plasmodium falciparum.Parasitology. 2007; 134: 1671-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, Mitamura et al., 2000Mitamura T. Hanada K. Ko-Mitamura E.P. Nishijima M. Horii T. Serum factors governing intraerythrocytic development and cell cycle progression of Plasmodium falciparum.Parasitol. Int. 2000; 49: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Together, these data support the hypothesis that components of human serum prevent sexual differentiation and that these components are depleted in CM. −SerM culture conditions enhance gametocyte production across strains (Figure 1D), demonstrating that sexual commitment is a conserved response of P. falciparum parasites to serum depletion. Whereas the commitment-inducing effect of −SerM conditions could be reversed by the addition of serum up to 34 ± 2 hr post invasion (hpi), rescue attempts at 38 ± 2 hpi and later time points were ineffectual (Figure 1E), indicating that sexual differentiation is irreversibly determined between 34 ± 2 and 38 ± 2 hpi. To identify the molecule(s) present in human serum that control parasite differentiation, we separated its components based on polarity (Figure 2A). The resulting serum fractions were tested for their ability to repress parasite sexual commitment. After two iterative rounds of fractionation and biological assays, several fractions with significant commitment-repressing activity were identified (Figures 2B and S1A). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) species to be major components in these fractions (Figures 2B, S1B, and S1C). Indeed, addition of LysoPC (16:0) efficiently compensated for the absence of serum in −SerM conditions and prevented parasite sexual commitment at a 50% inhibitory concentration of 1.73 μM (95% CI 1.13–2.65 μM) (Figure 2C).Figure S1Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Stepwise fractionation of serum (fractions A1–A8) identifies LysoPC as the active component.

Using a fluorescent analog of the lipid, we demonstrated that trophozoites and schizonts, but not younger stage asexual parasites or gametocytes, rapidly incorporated LysoPC or metabolites thereof into parasite membranes (Figures 2D and S2A). These results are suggestive of LysoPC uptake through a parasite-induced channel that is only active in mature asexual stages, such as the recently characterized plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC) (Nguitragool et al., 2011Nguitragool W. Bokhari A.A. Pillai A.D. Rayavara K. Sharma P. Turpin B. Aravind L. Desai S.A. Malaria parasite clag3 genes determine channel-mediated nutrient uptake by infected red blood cells.Cell. 2011; 145: 665-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In support of active uptake, we found that all LysoPC species detectable by mass spectrometry are significantly depleted in CM compared to fresh serum-complemented medium (Figure 2E). To determine a possible function for serum LysoPC in receptor-mediated signaling, as described in various eukaryotic systems (Gómez-Muñoz et al., 1999Gómez-Muñoz A. O’Brien L. Hundal R.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 988-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Yang et al., 2005Yang L.V. Radu C.G. Wang L. Riedinger M. Witte O.N. Gi-independent macrophage chemotaxis to lysophosphatidylcholine via the immunoregulatory GPCR G2A.Blood. 2005; 105: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we tested a series of non-hydrolysable LysoPC analogs (Danker et al., 2010Danker K. Reutter W. Semini G. Glycosidated phospholipids: uncoupling of signalling pathways at the plasma membrane.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2010; 160: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). None of these analogs, including the previously characterized bioactive compounds miltefosine and edelfosine, could block sexual commitment (Figures 2F and S1C). Notably, LysoPC depletion resulted in reduced parasite progeny numbers (Figure 2G). Together, these observations suggested a metabolic link rather than direct receptor-mediated signaling events in LysoPC-mediated regulation of sexual commitment. To investigate the role of LysoPC metabolism in sexual commitment, we performed a series of heavy isotope-based metabolic labeling assays. Following a 12-hr incubation period with 13C palmitate- or 2H choline-labeled LysoPC, parasites were subjected to extraction and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. These experiments revealed that parasites indeed metabolized LysoPC and used it to synthesize choline- and fatty-acid-containing products. The majority of free choline in the parasite (68%) was labeled even in the presence of equimolar amounts of unlabeled choline (21.5 μM) in the medium, suggesting that LysoPC is the major choline source for P. falciparum blood stage parasites (Figure 3A and Dataset S1). Relative metabolite quantification further demonstrated that the levels of phosphatidic acids (PAs), diglycerides (DGs), and some species of phosphatidylcholine (PCs) dropped significantly under LysoPC-depleted conditions (Figure 3B and Dataset S1). PCs are the most abundant membrane lipids in P. falciparum (Gulati et al., 2015Gulati S. Ekland E.H. Ruggles K.V. Chan R.B. Jayabalasingham B. Zhou B. Mantel P.Y. Lee M.C. Spottiswoode N. Coburn-Flynn O. et al.Profiling the Essential Nature of Lipid Metabolism in Asexual Blood and Gametocyte Stages of Plasmodium falciparum.Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 18: 371-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and PAs and DGs are their direct metabolic precursors in the Kennedy pathway (Figure 3C). To confirm a direct link between sexual differentiation and the levels of PC (or its precursors, PA and DG), we attempted to block sexual commitment by addition of these lipids to the growth medium. However, parasites failed to efficiently access exogenous pools of these molecules (Figure 3D), explaining their inability to repress sexual commitment (Figure S2B). Next, we altered the parasites’ access to Kennedy pathway substrates choline and glucose in absence of LysoPC. Glucose is metabolized into glycerol-3-phosphate, which in turn is acylated to yield PA and DG; choline is activated into cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-choline before reacting with glucose-derived DG to yield PC (Figure 3C). Therefore, if PC levels regulate sexual commitment, we expected that increasing choline levels block sexual commitment in the presence of sufficient glycolysis by elevating cellular PC via the Kennedy pathway. Indeed, addition of super-physiological concentrations of choline to −SerM medium prevented sexual differentiation (Figure 3E), and this effect was dependent on glucose levels (Figure 3F). Metabolomic analysis confirmed that, similar to LysoPC, the added choline was incorporated into PC and significantly increased its cellular concentration under standard glucose levels (Figures 3G and S2C and Dataset S1). In contrast to limiting levels of LysoPC and choline, glucose depletion is not sufficient to induce commitment independently (Figure S2D). To determine the impact of LysoPC depletion on gene expression in the parasite, we performed an RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) timecourse experiment (Figure S3A). In brief, highly synchronous parasite populations were split at 30 ± 2 hpi and subsequently cultured in either LysoPC-free −SerM or −SerM complemented with 20 μM LysoPC. Parasites grown in +SerM served as a control for conditions that inhibit gametocytogenesis. RNA was then collected in 4-hr increments to investigate gene regulation during sexual commitment. Comparative transcriptional profiling of two P. falciparum strains revealed a dramatic induction of ap2-g transcription in absence of LysoPC, demonstrating that the lipid acts upstream of the earliest known regulator of differentiation. We found a total of 342 genes significantly induced in response to LysoPC depletion, while 45 genes were downregulated (Figures 4A and S3B and Dataset S2). No significant differences were detected between parasites cultured in serum- and LysoPC-complemented medium (Figure 4A), demonstrating that LysoPC maintains default transcription of blood-stage parasites in an autonomous manner. On the other hand, LysoPC depletion resulted in a cascade effect with a first set of 25 genes induced rapidly after culture conditions were changed (Figure 4B). The prominent induction of metabolism-related genes found within this group, including ethanolamine kinase (ek), phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase (pmt), and genes encoding enzymes required for methyl-donor synthesis (S-adenosylmethionine synthase, SAMS; S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase, SAMMT), suggests a compensatory utilization of ethanolamine as a Kennedy pathway substrate for PC biosynthesis. Under LysoPC-limiting conditions, elevated ek and pmt activity may act in concert to catalyze production of the Kennedy substrate phosphocholine (P-choline) from ethanolamine via stepwise phosphorylation and SAM-dependent methylation events, ultimately securing cellular PC levels. It has previously been demonstrated that this alternative Kennedy pathway route is indeed active in blood-stage P. falciparum (Pessi et al., 2004Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B.

To evaluate the metabolic changes observed by RNA-seq, we also determined the role of key components of the Kennedy pathway on a protein level. First, we found that specific inhibition of the Kennedy pathway enzyme choline kinase (CK) induces sexual commitment even in the presence of LysoPC or excess choline and glucose (Figure 4C).

The mechanisms underlying chromatin expansion in daughter cells remain largely unclear. Here, we describe the transient formation of nuclear actin filaments (F-actin) during mitotic exit. These nuclear F-actin structures assemble in daughter cell nuclei and undergo dynamic reorganization to promote nuclear protrusions and volume expansion throughout early G1 of the cell cycle. Specific inhibition of this nuclear F-actin assembly impaired nuclear expansion and chromatin decondensation after mitosis and during early mouse embryonic development. Biochemical screening for mitotic nuclear F-actin interactors identified the actin-disassembling factor cofilin-1. Optogenetic regulation of cofilin-1 revealed its critical role for controlling timing, turnover and dynamics of F-actin assembly inside daughter cell nuclei. Our findings identify a cell-cycle-specific and spatiotemporally controlled form of nuclear F-actin that reorganizes the mammalian nucleus after mitosis. Baarlink et al. identify a transient pool of nuclear F-actin, the dynamics of which are controlled by cofilin-1 that accumulates after mitosis and is important for chromatin reorganization in G1."

https://openalex.org/W2767518162,"Accumulating data support a role for bioactive lipids as mediators of lipotixicity in cardiomyocytes. One class of these, the ceramides, constitutes a family of molecules that differ in structure and are synthesized by distinct enzymes, ceramide synthase (CerS)1-CerS6. Data support that specific ceramides and the enzymes that catalyze their formation play distinct roles in cell function. In a mouse model of diabetic cardiomyopathy, sphingolipid profiling revealed increases in not only the CerS5-derived ceramides but also in very long chain (VLC) ceramides derived from CerS2. Overexpression of CerS2 elevated VLC ceramides caused insulin resistance, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and mitophagy. Palmitate induced CerS2 and oxidative stress, mitophagy, and apoptosis, which were prevented by depletion of CerS2. Neither overexpression nor knockdown of CerS5 had any function in these processes, suggesting a chain-length dependent impact of ceramides on mitochondrial function. This concept was also supported by the observation that synthetic mitochondria-targeted ceramides led to mitophagy in a manner proportional to N-acyl chain length. Finally, blocking mitophagy exacerbated cell death. Taken together, our results support a model by which CerS2 and VLC ceramides have a distinct role in lipotoxicity, leading to mitochondrial damage, which results in subsequent adaptive mitophagy. Our data reveal a novel lipotoxic pathway through CerS2.-Law, B. A., Liao, X., Moore, K. S., Southard, A., Roddy, P., Ji, R., Szulc, Z., Bielawska, A., Schulze, P. C., Cowart, L. A.

https://openalex.org/W2768727863,"A multistage tandem mass spectrometry approach enables the application of native proteomics to characterize intact endogenous protein complexes in discovery mode, including covalent modifications as well as noncovalently bound cofactors and ligands. Protein complexes exhibit great diversity in protein membership, post-translational modifications and noncovalent cofactors, enabling them to function as the actuators of many important biological processes. The exposition of these molecular features using current methods lacks either throughput or molecular specificity, ultimately limiting the use of protein complexes as direct analytical targets in a wide range of applications. Here, we apply native proteomics, enabled by a multistage tandem MS approach, to characterize 125 intact endogenous complexes and 217 distinct proteoforms derived from mouse heart and human cancer cell lines in discovery mode. The native conditions preserved soluble protein–protein interactions, high-stoichiometry noncovalent cofactors, covalent modifications to cysteines, and, remarkably, superoxide ligands bound to the metal cofactor of superoxide dismutase 2. These data enable precise compositional analysis of protein complexes as they exist in the cell and demonstrate a new approach that uses MS as a bridge to structural biology."

https://openalex.org/W2767281352,"Alternative promoter usage is a proteome-expanding mechanism that allows multiple pre-mRNAs to be transcribed from a single gene. The impact of this mechanism on the proteome and whether it is positively exploited in normal organismal responses remain unclear. We found that the plant photoreceptor phytochrome induces genome-wide changes in alternative promoter selection in Arabidopsis thaliana. Through this mechanism, protein isoforms with different N termini are produced that display light-dependent differences in localization. For instance, shade-grown plants accumulate a cytoplasmic isoform of glycerate kinase (GLYK), an essential photorespiration enzyme that was previously thought to localize exclusively to the chloroplast. Cytoplasmic GLYK constitutes a photorespiratory bypass that alleviates fluctuating light-induced photoinhibition. Therefore, phytochrome controls alternative promoter selection to modulate protein localization in response to changing light conditions. This study suggests that alternative promoter usage represents another ubiquitous layer of gene expression regulation in eukaryotes that contributes to diversification of the proteome."
https://openalex.org/W2767798800,"High-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) improves cerebral executive function (EF), but the improvement in EF is attenuated after repeated HIIE, perhaps because of lower lactate availability for the brain. This investigation examined whether improved EF after exercise relates to brain lactate uptake. Fourteen healthy, male subjects performed 2 HIIE protocols separated by 60 min of rest. Blood samples were obtained from the right internal jugular venous bulb and from the brachial artery to determine arterial-venous differences across the brain for lactate (a-v difflactate), glucose (a-v diffglucose), oxygen (a-v diffoxygen), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; a-v diffBDNF). EF was evaluated by the color-word Stroop task. The first HIIE improved EF for 40 min, whereas the second HIIE improved EF only immediately after exercise. The a-v diffglucose was unchanged, whereas the a-v diffBDNF increased similarly after both HIIEs, and the a-v difflactate increased, but the increase was attenuated after the second HIIE, compared with the first HIIE ( P < 0.05). The EF after HIIE correlated with the a-v difflactate ( r2 = 0.62; P < 0.01). We propose that attenuated improvement in EF after repeated HIIE relates to reduced cerebral lactate metabolism and is, thereby, linked to systemic metabolism as an example of the lactate shuttle mechanism.-Hashimoto, T., Tsukamoto, H., Takenaka, S., Olesen, N.

https://openalex.org/W2767741561,"Patients recovering from sepsis have higher rates of CNS morbidities associated with long-lasting impairment of cognitive functions, including neurodegenerative diseases. However, the molecular etiology of these sepsis-induced impairments is unclear. Here, we investigated the role of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration-associated changes, and cognitive dysfunction arising after sepsis recovery. Adult Wistar rats underwent cecal ligation and perforation (CLP), and serum and brain (hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) samples were obtained at days 1, 15, and 30 after the CLP. We examined these samples for systemic and brain inflammation; amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and Ser-202–phosphorylated Tau (p-TauSer-202) levels; and RAGE, RAGE ligands, and RAGE intracellular signaling. Serum markers associated with the acute proinflammatory phase of sepsis (TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6) rapidly increased and then progressively decreased during the 30-day period post-CLP, concomitant with a progressive increase in RAGE ligands (S100B, Nɛ-[carboxymethyl]lysine, HSP70, and HMGB1). In the brain, levels of RAGE and Toll-like receptor 4, glial fibrillary acidic protein and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase, and Aβ and p-TauSer-202 also increased during that time. Of note, intracerebral injection of RAGE antibody into the hippocampus at days 15, 17, and 19 post-CLP reduced Aβ and p-TauSer-202 accumulation, Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling, levels of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein, and behavioral deficits associated with cognitive decline. These results indicate that brain RAGE is an essential factor in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders following acute systemic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2767893723,"Mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics analysis of oligodendrocyte differentiation led to the identification of an endogenous metabolite, taurine, that enhanced the process of drug-induced OPC differentiation. Endogenous metabolites play essential roles in the regulation of cellular identity and activity. Here we have investigated the process of oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation, a process that becomes limiting during progressive stages of demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis, using mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics. Levels of taurine, an aminosulfonic acid possessing pleotropic biological activities and broad tissue distribution properties, were found to be significantly elevated (∼20-fold) during the course of oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation. When added exogenously at physiologically relevant concentrations, taurine was found to dramatically enhance the processes of drug-induced in vitro OPC differentiation and maturation. Mechanism of action studies suggest that the oligodendrocyte-differentiation-enhancing activities of taurine are driven primarily by its ability to directly increase available serine pools, which serve as the initial building block required for the synthesis of the glycosphingolipid components of myelin that define the functional oligodendrocyte cell state."

Here we have developed a new class of synthetic T-cell receptor-like signal-transduction device that functions efficiently in human nonimmune cells and triggers release of output molecules specifically upon sensing contact with a target cell. This device employs an interleukin signaling cascade, whose OFF/ON switching is controlled by biophysical segregation of a transmembrane signal-inhibitory protein from the sensor cell-target cell interface. We further show that designer nonimmune cells equipped with this device driving expression of a membrane-penetrator/prodrug-activating enzyme construct could specifically kill target cells in the presence of the prodrug, indicating its potential usefulness for target-cell-specific, cell-based enzyme-prodrug cancer therapy. Our study also contributes to the advancement of synthetic biology by extending available design principles to transmit extracellular information to cells."

At present, we do not yet have a valid, scientific instrument that is designed to evaluate adult resilience in Spanish-speaking countries and that accounts for family, social and individual components. This study aimed at investigating the construct and cross-cultural validity of the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) by combining Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Hierarchical Regression models in a Hispanic Latin-American group. A community sample of 805 adults answered the RSA, Spanish Language Stressful Life-Events checklist (SL-SLE), and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25). First-order CFA verified the six factors structure for the RSA (RMSEA = .037, SRMR = .047, CFI = .91, TLI = .90). Five RSA scales and total score have good internal consistency (scales α > .70; total score α = .90). Two second-order CFA verified the intrapersonal and interpersonal dimensions of the protector factors of resilience, as well as their commonality and uniqueness with affective symptoms (anxiety and depression). An exploratory MDS reproduced the relations of RSA items and factors at first and second-order levels against random simulated data, thereby providing initial evidence of its cross-cultural validity in a Spanish-speaking group. The Four-steps hierarchical model showed that the RSA scales are the strongest predictors of anxiety and depression-greater than gender, age, education and stressful life-events. Three RSA scales are significant unique predictors of affective symptoms. In addition, similar to findings in diverse cultural settings, resilience is positively associated with age but not with education. Women report higher scores of Social Resources and Social Competence and lower scores of Perception of the Self. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the construct and criterion-related validity of the RSA in broad, diverse and Spanish speaking sample."
https://openalex.org/W2767860958,"The promotion of livestock production is widely believed to support enhanced diet quality and child nutrition, but the empirical evidence for this causal linkage remains narrow and ambiguous. This study examines whether adoption of improved dairy cow breeds is linked to farm-level outcomes that translate into household-level benefits including improved child nutrition outcomes in Uganda. Using nationwide data from Uganda's National Panel Survey, propensity score matching is used to create an unbiased counterfactual, based on observed characteristics, to assess the net impacts of improved dairy cow adoption. All estimates were tested for robustness and sensitivity to variations in observable and unobservable confounders. Results based on the matched samples showed that households adopting improved dairy cows significantly increased milk yield-by over 200% on average. This resulted in higher milk sales and milk intakes, demonstrating the potential of this agricultural technology to both integrate households into modern value chains and increase households' access to animal source foods. Use of improved dairy cows increased household food expenditures by about 16%. Although undernutrition was widely prevalent in the study sample and in matched households, the adoption of improved dairy cows was associated with lower child stunting in adopter household. In scale terms, results also showed that holding larger farms tends to support adoption, but that this also stimulates the household's ability to achieve gains from adoption, which can translate into enhanced nutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2767826331,"The regulation of host factors is a key strategy employed by viruses to suppress host defense systems and enhance their propagation; however, the mechanisms that underlie this regulation is still unclear. Formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) recognizes numerous proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory stimuli, and emerging reports indicate elevated levels of FPR2 in several disease conditions. Although studies have implicated FPR2 in a myriad of inflammatory conditions, how viruses exploit this cell-surface receptor to facilitate disease progression remains unknown. In this study, we show that the activation of TLR3 and TLR7 induces the up-regulation of FPR2. We provide evidence that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation is critical for the induction of FPR2 by double-stranded RNA, but not single-stranded RNA viral mimetics. Use of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from IFN-αβ receptor-deficient mice revealed that signaling via the type I IFN-STAT3 pathway is essential for FPR2 induction. We demonstrate that virus infection with enterovirus 71 and H1N1 PR8 influenza virus results in increased FPR2 expression. Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation in virus-infected cells repressed the induction of FPR2, which led to a reduction in viral loads. Finally, the absence of FPR2 in murine BMDMs resulted in lower viral loads, which suggests that FPR2 may be important for virus replication. Altogether, our study provides novel insights into how RNA viruses may hijack the immune system to facilitate their replication and survival. Identification of these regulatory elements may be useful in designing therapeutics for inflammatory disease conditions that are associated with elevated levels of FPR2.-Ampomah, P. B., Moraes, L.

Thirty-eight patients with chronic stroke-related hemiparesis and a range of motor and functional capacities (17 females and 21 males, aged 25-78), and 10 healthy subjects were included. Four objects were used (tissue packet, teaspoon, bottle and tennis ball). Participants were instructed to ""grasp the object as if you are going to use it"". Three trials were video-recorded for each object. A total of 456 grasps were analysed and rated using a custom-designed Functional Grasp Scale. Eight grasp-types were identified from the analysis: healthy subjects used Multi-pulpar, Pluri-digital, Lateral-pinch and Palmar grasps (Standard Grasps). Patients used the same grasps with in addition Digito-palmar, Raking, Ulnar and Interdigital grasps (Alternative Grasps). Only patients with a moderate or relatively good functional ability used Standard grasps. The correlation and regression analyses showed this was conditioned by sufficient finger and elbow extensor strength (Pluri-digital grasp); thumb extensor and wrist flexor strength (Lateral pinch) or in forearm supinator strength (Palmar grasp). By contrast, the patients who had severe impairment used Alternative grasps that did not involve the thumb. These strategies likely compensate specific impairments. Regression and correlation analyses suggested that weakness had a greater influence over grasp strategy than spasticity. This would imply that treatment should focus on improving hand strength and control although reducing spasticity may be useful in some cases."

Herein, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to provide further molecular insight into the interactions, structural dynamics, orientation behavior, and cationic residues snorkeling of pardaxin in the DMPC, DPPC, POPC, POPG, POPG/POPE (3:1), and POPG/POPE (1:3) lipid bilayers. The results showed that the C-terminal helix of the peptide was maintained in all six types of the model-bilayers and pardaxin was tilted into the DMPC, DPPC, and POPG/POPE mixed bilayers more than the POPC and POPG bilayers. As well as, the structure of zwitterionic membranes was more affected by the peptide than the anionic bilayers. Taken together, the study demonstrated that the cationic residues of pardaxin snorkeled toward the interface of lipid bilayers and all phenylalanine residues of the peptide played important roles in the peptide-membrane interactions. We hope that this work will provide a better understanding of the interactions of antimicrobial peptides with the membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2767367522,"Background: Placental malaria is a major cause of low birthweight, principally due to impaired fetal growth. Intervillositis, a local inflammatory response to placental malaria, is central to the pathogenesis of poor fetal growth as it impairs transplacental amino acid transport. Given the link between inflammation and autophagy, we investigated whether placental malaria-associated intervillositis increased placental autophagy as a potential mechanism in impaired fetal growth.

Methods: We examined placental biopsies collected after delivery from uninfected women (n = 17) and from women with Plasmodium falciparum infection with (n = 14) and without (n = 7) intervillositis. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining coupled with advanced image analysis were used to quantify the expression of autophagic markers (LC3-II, LC3-I, Rab7, ATG4B and p62) and the density of autophagosomes (LC3-positive puncta) and lysosomes (LAMP1-positive puncta).

Results: Placental malaria with intervillositis was associated with higher LC3-II: LC3-I ratio, suggesting increased autophagosome formation. We found higher density of autophagosomes and lysosomes in the syncytiotrophoblast of malaria-infected placentas with intervillositis. However, there appear to be no biologically relevant increase in LC3B/LAMP1 colocalization and expression of Rab7, a molecule involved in autophagosome/lysosome fusion, was lower in placental malaria with intervillositis, indicating a block in the later stage of autophagy. ATG4B and p62 expression showed no significant difference across histological groups suggesting normal autophagosome maturation and loading of cargo proteins into autophagosomes. The density of autophagosomes and lysosomes in the syncytiotrophoblast was negatively correlated with placental amino acid uptake.

Conclusions: Placental malaria-associated intervillositis is associated with dysregulated autophagy that may impair transplacental amino acid transport, possibly contributing to poor fetal growth."

In the present study, by using the Stelic animal model of NASH and NASH-derived liver carcinogenesis, we investigated the role of the folate-dependent 1-carbon metabolism in the pathogenesis of NASH. We demonstrated that advanced NASH and NASH-related liver carcinogenesis are characterized by a significant dysregulation of 1-carbon homeostasis, with diminished expression of key 1-carbon metabolism genes, especially a marked inhibition of the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase ( Ahcy) gene and an increased level of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH). The reduction in Ahcy expression was associated with gene-specific cytosine DNA hypermethylation and enrichment of the gene promoter by trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 and deacetylated histone H4 lysine 16, 2 main transcription-inhibiting markers. These results indicate that epigenetically mediated inhibition of Ahcy expression may be a driving force in causing SAH elevation and subsequent downstream disturbances in transsulfuration and transmethylation pathways during the development and progression of NASH.-Pogribny, I.

Inhibition of autophagy using CQ or RNA interference potentiated PI3K inhibitor-induced apoptosis. Combined inhibition of PI3K and autophagy effectively induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization, which required the BH3-only proapoptotic proteins Bim and PUMA.

While the properties of model or isolated membranes have been extensively studied, there has been little evaluation of internal membranes in living cells. Here, we use a Nile Red based probe, NR12S, and ratiometric live cell imaging, to analyze the membrane order of the plasma membrane and endocytic recycling compartment. We find that after a brief incubation to allow endocytosis, NR12S is distributed between the plasma membrane and the endocytic recycling compartment. The NR12S reports that the endocytic recycling compartment is more highly ordered than the plasma membrane. We also find that the plasma membrane and the endocytic recycling compartment are differentially affected by altering cellular cholesterol levels. The membrane order of the plasma membrane, but not the endocytic recycling compartment, is altered significantly when cellular cholesterol content is increased or decreased by 20%. These results demonstrate that changes in cellular cholesterol differentially alter membrane order within different organelles."

Disruptions in this barrier are associated with diseases such as Crohn's disease, colitis, and colon cancer, but mechanistic insights into these processes and diseases are limited. We have previously shown that loss of a conserved O-glycosyltransferase (PGANT4) in Drosophila results in aberrant secretion of components of the peritrophic/mucous membrane in the larval digestive tract. Here, we show that loss of PGANT4 disrupts the mucosal barrier, resulting in epithelial expression of the IL-6-like cytokine Upd3, leading to activation of JAK/STAT signaling, differentiation of cells that form the progenitor cell niche, and abnormal proliferation of progenitor cells. This niche disruption could be recapitulated by overexpressing upd3 and rescued by deleting upd3, highlighting a crucial role for this cytokine. Moreover, niche integrity and cell proliferation in pgant4-deficient animals could be rescued by overexpression of the conserved cargo receptor Tango1 and partially rescued by supplementation with exogenous mucins or treatment with antibiotics. Our findings help elucidate the paracrine signaling events activated by a compromised mucosal barrier and provide a novel in vivo screening platform for mucin mimetics and other strategies to treat diseases of the oral mucosa and digestive tract."

Methods Ninety-six patients treated with DAAs, either alone (91) or in combination with PEG interferon (5), were tested for HCV-RNA and for HCV-Ag at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 during treatment and 12 weeks after completion. The concordance and correlation between the viral parameters as well as the respective kinetics during and after treatment were evaluated. Results A sustained viral response (SVR) was achieved in 82 patients (91%), whereas 11 relapsed (R) and 1 showed a virological breakthrough while receiving treatment. HCV-RNA and HCV-Ag showed good concordance (kappa = 0.62) and correlation. No significant differences between SVR and R was observed in either assay at 2 and 4 weeks after the start of treatment. At 8 weeks, HCV-Ag showed higher accuracy than HCV-RNA (AUC: 0.74 vs. 0.55) and there was a significantly greater decrease from baseline in SVR than in R (4.01 vs. 3.36 log10; p<0.05). Conclusions Monitoring during treatment with DAAs by using either HCV-RNA or HCV-Ag has only a limited predictive value for SVR. Since those assays are equivalent for identifying a virological relapse, HCV-Ag may be preferred from an economical and organizational perspective."

We previously reported that Apobec2 deficiency in mice leads to a shift in muscle fiber type, myopathy, and diminished muscle mass. However, the mechanisms of myopathy caused by Apobec2 deficiency and its physiologic functions are unclear. Here we show that, although Apobec2 localizes to the sarcomeric Z-lines in mouse tissue and cultured myotubes, the sarcomeric structure is not affected in Apobec2-deficient muscle. In contrast, electron microscopy reveals enlarged mitochondria and mitochondria engulfed by autophagic vacuoles, suggesting that Apobec2 deficiency causes mitochondrial defects leading to increased mitophagy in skeletal muscle. Indeed, Apobec2 deficiency results in increased reactive oxygen species generation and depolarized mitochondria, leading to mitophagy as a defensive response. Furthermore, the exercise capacity of Apobec2-/- mice is impaired, implying Apobec2 deficiency results in ongoing muscle dysfunction. The presence of rimmed vacuoles in myofibers from 10-mo-old mice suggests that the chronic muscle damage impairs normal autophagy. We conclude that Apobec2 deficiency causes mitochondrial defects that increase muscle mitophagy, leading to myopathy and atrophy.

Associations between ISAR, CGA, comorbid risk factors and diseases, length of hospital stay, number of nursing and physiotherapy hours, and falls during hospital stay were analyzed.Of 381 ISAR screenings, 327 (85.8%) were positive, confirming a high percentage of patients at risk of adverse events. Of these, 300 CGAs revealed 82.7% abnormal results, indicating activities of daily living impairment combined with cognitive, emotional or mobility disturbances. Abnormal CGA resulted in a longer hospital stay (14.0±10.3 days in ISAR+/CGA abnormal compared with 7.6±7.0 days in ISAR+/CGA normal and 8.1±5.4 days in ISAR-, both p<0.001), increased nursing hours (3.4±1.1 hours/day in ISAR+/CGA abnormal compared with 2.5±1.0 hours/day in ISAR+/CGA normal and 2.2±0.8 hours/day in ISAR-, both p<0.001), and increased falls (7.3% in ISAR+/CGA abnormal, 0% in ISAR+/CGA normal, 1.9% in ISAR-). Physiotherapy hours were only significantly increased in ISAR+/CGA abnormal (3.0±2.7 hours) compared with in ISAR+/CGA normal (1.6±1.4 hours, p<0.001) whereas the comparison with ISAR- (2.4±2.4 hours) did not reach significance (p = 0.368). In multivariable regressions, the CGA domains activities of daily living impairment (assessed by Barthel-Index) and signs of depression (assessed by geriatric depression scale) predicted longer length of hospital stay. High ISAR score, and impairment in activities of daily living and cognition (assessed by mini-mental state examination and clock-drawing test) predicted increased nursing hours, and impairment in activities of daily living and mobility predicted increased physiotherapy hours.An abnormal geriatric screening and assessment is associated with longer hospital stay, more nursing and physiotherapy hours, and more falls."
https://openalex.org/W2767246645,"Recent evidence suggests that chemokine CXCL12, the cognate agonist of chemokine receptors CXCR4 and ACKR3, reduces thrombin-mediated impairment of endothelial barrier function. A detailed characterization of the effects of CXCL12 on thrombin-mediated human lung endothelial hyperpermeability is lacking and structure-function correlations are not available. Furthermore, effects of other CXCR4/ACKR3 ligands on lung endothelial barrier function are unknown. Thus, we tested the effects of a panel of CXCR4/ACKR3 ligands (CXCL12, CXCL11, ubiquitin, AMD3100, TC14012) and compared the CXCR4/ACKR3 activities of CXCL12 variants (CXCL12α/β, CXCL12(3–68), CXCL121, CXCL122, CXCL12-S-S4V, CXCL12-R47E, CXCL12-K27A/R41A/R47A) with their effects on human lung endothelial barrier function in permeability assays. CXCL12α enhanced human primary pulmonary artery endothelial cell (hPPAEC) barrier function, whereas CXCL11, ubiquitin, AMD3100 and TC14012 were ineffective. Pre-treatment of hPPAEC with CXCL12α and ubiquitin reduced thrombin-mediated hyperpermeability. CXCL12α-treatment of hPPAEC after thrombin exposure reduced barrier function impairment by 70% (EC50 0.05–0.5nM), which could be antagonized with AMD3100; ubiquitin (0.03–3μM) was ineffective. In a human lung microvascular endothelial cell line (HULEC5a), CXCL12α and ubiquitin post-treatment attenuated thrombin-induced hyperpermeability to a similar degree. CXCL12(3–68) was inefficient to activate CXCR4 in Presto-Tango β-arrestin2 recruitment assays; CXCL12-S-S4V, CXCL12-R47E and CXCL12-K27A/R41A/R47A showed significantly reduced potencies to activate CXCR4. While the potencies of all proteins in ACKR3 Presto-Tango assays were comparable, the efficacy of CXCL12(3–68) to activate ACKR3 was significantly reduced. The potencies to attenuate thrombin-mediated hPPAEC barrier function impairment were: CXCL12α/β, CXCL121, CXCL12-K27A/R41A/R47A > CXCL12-S-S4V, CXCL12-R47E > CXCL122 > CXCL12(3–68). Our findings indicate that CXCR4 activation attenuates thrombin-induced lung endothelial barrier function impairment and suggest that protective effects of CXCL12 are dictated by its CXCR4 agonist activity and interactions of distinct protein moieties with heparan sulfate on the endothelial surface. These data may facilitate development of compounds with improved pharmacological properties to attenuate thrombin-induced vascular leakage in the pulmonary circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2767847412,"At least two parasitic mites have moved from Asian species of honeybees to infest Apis mellifera. Of these two, Varroa destructor is more widespread globally while Tropilaelaps mercedesae has remained largely in Asia. Tropilaelaps mites are most problematic when A. mellifera is managed outside its native range in contact with Asian species of Apis. In areas where this occurs, beekeepers of A. mellifera treat aggressively for Tropilaelaps and Varroa is either outcompeted or is controlled as a result of the aggressive treatment regime used against Tropilaelaps. Many mite control products used worldwide may in fact control both mites but environmental conditions differ globally and thus a control product that works well in one area may be less or ineffective in other areas. This is especially true of volatile compounds. In the current research we tested several commercial products known to control Varroa and powdered sulfur for efficacy against Tropilaelaps. Additionally, we tested the cultural control method of making a hive division to reduce Tropilaelaps growth in both the parent and offspring colony. Making a split or nucleus colony significantly reduced mite population in both the parent and nucleus colony when compared to un-manipulated control colonies. The formic acid product, Mite-Away Quick Strips®, was the only commercial product that significantly reduced mite population 8 weeks after initiation of treatment without side effects. Sulfur also reduced mite populations but both sulfur and Hopguard® significantly impacted colony growth by reducing adult bee populations. Apivar® (amitraz) strips had no effect on mite or adult bee populations under the conditions tested."

Its precursor form, full-length interleukin-33 (FLIL33), is an intranuclear protein in many cell types, including fibroblasts, and its intracellular levels can change in response to stimuli. However, the mechanisms controlling the nuclear localization of FLIL33 or its stability in cells are not understood. Here, we identified importin-5 (IPO5), a member of the importin family of nuclear transport proteins, as an intracellular binding partner of FLIL33. By overexpressing various FLIL33 protein segments and variants in primary human lung fibroblasts and HEK293T cells, we show that FLIL33, but not mature interleukin-33, physically interacts with IPO5 and that this interaction localizes to a cluster of charged amino acids (positions 46–56) but not to an adjacent segment (positions 61–67) in the FLIL33 N-terminal region. siRNA-mediated IPO5 knockdown in cell culture did not affect nuclear localization of FLIL33. However, the IPO5 knockdown significantly decreased the intracellular levels of overexpressed FLIL33, reversed by treatment with the 20S proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Furthermore, FLIL33 variants deficient in IPO5 binding remained intranuclear and exhibited decreased levels, which were also restored by the bortezomib treatment. These results indicate that the interaction between FLIL33 and IPO5 is localized to a specific segment of the FLIL33 protein, is not required for nuclear localization of FLIL33, and protects FLIL33 from proteasome-dependent degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2767427789,"The endosomal-lysosomal system (ELS), autophagy, and ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are cel- lular degradation pathways that each play a critical role in the removal of misfolded proteins and the prevention of the accumulation of abnormal proteins. Recent studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis have suggested that accumulation of aggregated β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides in the AD brain results from a dysfunction in these cellular clearance systems. However, the specific roles of these pathways in the removal of Aß peptides and the pathogenesis underlying AD are unclear. Our in vitro and in vivo genetic approaches revealed that ELS mainly removed monomeric β-amyloid42 (Aβ42), while autophagy and UPS clear oligomeric Aβ42. Although over- production of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate-5 increased Aβ42 clearance, it reduced the life span of Aβ42 transgenic flies. Our behavioral studies further demonstrated impaired autophagy and UPS-enhanced Aβ42- induced learning and memory deficits, but there was no effect on Aβ42-induced reduction in life span. Results from genetic fluorescence imaging showed that these pathways were damaged in the following order: UPS, autophagy, and finally ELS. The results of our study demonstrate that different degradation pathways play distinct roles in the removal of Aβ42 aggregates and in disease progression. These findings also suggest that pharmacologic treatments that are designed to stimulate cellular degradation pathways in patients with AD should be used with caution.—Ji, X.-R., Cheng, K.-C., Chen, Y.-R., Lin, T.-Y., Cheung, C.

https://openalex.org/W2767805589,"An earlier study suggested that the activity-inviting office landscape called ""The End of Sitting"", designed by Rietveld Architecture Art Affordances (RAAAF), should be considered as an alternative working environment to prevent sedentary behavior. The End of Sitting lacks chairs and tables but consists instead of a myriad of sloped surfaces at different heights that afford workers to stand, lean or recline at different locations. In this study, we assessed the impact of four of its workspaces on physical intensity, temporary comfort and productivity of office work and compared the outcomes with sitting and standing behind a desk. Twenty-four participants worked for 10 minutes in each of the six test conditions. Energy expenditure, measured by indirect calorimetry, and heart rate were recorded. Questionnaires were used to assess the perceived comfort. The number of words found in the word search test was counted as a measure of productivity. The majority of The End of Sitting workspaces led to a significant increase in energy expenditure compared with sitting behind a desk (ps < .05). Average MET values ranged from 1.40 to 1.58 which is a modest rise in energy expenditure compared to sitting (1.32 METs) and not significantly different from standing (1.47 METs). The scores on the general comfort scale indicated that some workspaces were less comfortable than sitting (ps < .05), but the vast majority of participants reported that at least one of The End of Sitting workspaces was equally or more comfortable than sitting. No differences in productivity between the test conditions were found. Further long-term studies are required to assess the behavioral adaptations, productivity and the level of comfort when using The End of Sitting as a permanent office."
https://openalex.org/W2767765697,"Coelomocytes represent the immune cells of echinoderms, but detailed knowledge about their roles during immune responses is very limited. One major challenge for studying coelomocyte biology is the lack of reagents to identify and purify distinct populations defined by objective molecular markers rather than by morphology-based classifications that are subjective at times. Glycosylation patterns are known to differ significantly between cell types in vertebrates, and furthermore they can vary depending on the developmental stage and activation states within a given lineage. Thus fluorescently labeled lectins that recognize distinct glycan structures on cell surface proteins are routinely used to identify discrete cell populations in the vertebrate immune system. Here we now employed a panel of fifteen fluorescently-labeled lectins to determine differences in the glycosylation features on the surface of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus coelomocytes by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Eight of the lectins (succinylated wheat germ agglutinin, Len culinaris lectin, Pisum sativum agglutinin, Saphora japonica agglutinin, Solanum tuberosum lectin, Lycopersicon esculentum lectin, Datura stramonium lectin, Vicia villosa lectin) showed distinct binding patterns to fixed and live cells of three major coelomocyte classes: phagocytic cells, red spherule cells, and vibratile cells. Importantly, almost all lectins bound only to a subgroup of cells within each cell type. Lastly, we established fluorescently-labeled lectin-based fluorescence activated cell sorting as a strategy to purify distinct S. purpuratus coelomocyte (sub-)populations based on molecular markers. We anticipate that this will become a routine approach in future studies focused on dissecting the roles of different coelomocytes in echinoderm immunity."

To evaluate the CSS of four subgroups of patients with stage IV NSCLC according to four different treatment modalities: combined modality of Chemotherapy, Surgery, and Radiation (Chem+Sur+RT), Chemotherapy and Radiation (Chem+RT), Chemotherapy and Surgery (Chem+Sur), and Chemotherapy only (Chem Only) by analyzing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-registered database. Kaplan-Meier methods were adopted and multivariable Cox regression models were built for the analysis of survival outcomes and risk factors. The 3-year CSS was 33.5% in “Chem+Sur+RT” group, 9.3% in “Chem+RT” group, 42.7% in “Chem+Sur” group and 11.8% in “Chem Only” group, which had significant difference in univariate log-rank test (P<0.001) and multivariate Cox regression (P<0.001). Moreover, we observed significant survival benefits in “Chem+Sur” group in all stage of T/N categories, including stage I, stage II, stage IIIa and stage IIIb (all P<0.001). Multimodality therapy, especially combined thoracic surgery and chemotherapy is associated with dramatically improved prognosis for patients with stage IV NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2767631664,"Depletion of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated transactivation response (TAR) RNA/DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) alters splicing efficiency of multiple transcripts and results in neuronal cell death. TDP-43 depletion can also disturb expression levels of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) as spliceosomal components. Despite this knowledge, the relationship between cell death and alteration of snRNA expression during TDP-43 depletion remains unclear. Here, we knocked down TDP-43 in murine neuroblastoma Neuro2A cells and found a time lag between efficient TDP-43 depletion and appearance of cell death, suggesting that several mechanisms mediate between these two events. The amount of U6 snRNA was significantly decreased during TDP-43 depletion prior to increase of cell death, whereas that of U1, U2, and U4 snRNAs was not. Downregulation of U6 snRNA led to cell death, whereas transient exogenous expression of U6 snRNA counteracted the effect of TDP-43 knockdown on cell death, and slightly decreased the mis-splicing rate of Dnajc5 and Sortilin 1 transcripts, which are assisted by TDP-43. These results suggest that regulation of the U6 snRNA expression level by TDP-43 is a key factor in the increase in cell death upon TDP-43 loss-of-function."
https://openalex.org/W2767654284,"Introduction Recent evidence suggests a lack of standardization of shoulder arthroplasty outcomes. This issue is a limiting factor in systematic reviews. Core outcome set (COS) methodology could address this problem by delineating a minimum set of outcomes for measurement in all shoulder arthroplasty trials. Methods A ClinicalTrials.gov search yielded 114 results. Eligible trials were coded on the following characteristics: study status, study type, arthroplasty type, sample size, measured outcomes, outcome measurement device, specific metric of measurement, method of aggregation, outcome classification, and adverse events. Results Sixty-six trials underwent data abstraction and data synthesis. Following abstraction, 383 shoulder arthroplasty outcomes were organized into 11 outcome domains. The most commonly reported outcomes were shoulder outcome score (n = 58), pain (n = 33), and quality of life (n = 15). The most common measurement devices were the Constant-Murley Shoulder Outcome Score (n = 38) and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Score (n = 33). Temporal patterns of outcome use was also found. Conclusion Our study suggests the need for greater standardization of outcomes and instruments. The lack of consistency across trials indicates that developing a core outcome set for shoulder arthroplasty trials would be worthwhile. Such standardization would allow for more effective comparison across studies in systematic reviews, while at the same time consider important outcomes that may be underrepresented otherwise. This review of outcomes provides an evidence-based foundation for the development of a COS for shoulder arthroplasty."

The management approach for such patients routinely includes spironolactone at our centre. We undertook this study to assess the efficacy of spironolactone for the treatment of hypokalemia in PD patients.Retrospective chart review of PD patients at a single centre. Serum potassium was compared prior to initiation of spironolactone and two months afterwards. Indication for spironolactone and changes in blood pressure (BP), weight, and serum creatinine were also recorded.The chart review identified 53 patients who fit our selection criteria. The mean age was 64 +/- 15 years and the majority was treated with continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis. Serum potassium rose from 3.7 +/- 0.5 to 4.2 +/- 0.5 mmol/L (P<0.0001) after 2 months with a mean dose of spironolactone of 28.5+/-15.2 mg (median dose 25 mg). A significant reduction in systolic BP was observed from 150+/- 18 to 137 +/-24 (P = 0.002); a non- significant reduction in diastolic BP was also observed. The rise in potassium was constant in the range of 0.4 to 0.5 mmol/L regardless of whether spironolactone was initiated for hypokalemia, diuresis, or as an antihypertensive. There was no change in serum creatinine or body weight two months after introduction of spironolactone.Spironolactone is safe and effective in treating hypokalemia in PD patients. It is also an effective antihypertensive agent and merits further study in the PD population."

Aerobic exercise has shown to improve PFC function and cognitive performance, however, its effects on SUD individuals remain unclear.To verify the cognitive performance and oxygenation of the PFC during an incremental exercise in SUD individuals.Fourteen individuals under SUD treatment performed a maximum graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer with continuous measurements of oxygen consumption, PFC oxygenation, and inhibitory control (Stroop test) every two minutes of exercise at different intensities. Fifteen non-SUD individuals performed the same protocol and were used as control group.Exercise increased oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) and total hemoglobin (tHb) by 9% and 7%, respectively. However, when compared to a non-SUD group, this increase was lower at high intensities (p<0.001), and the inhibitory cognitive control was lower at rest and during exercise (p<0.007). In addition, PFC hemodynamics during exercise was inversely correlated with inhibitory cognitive performance (reaction time) (r = -0.62, p = 0.001), and a lower craving perception for the specific abused substance (p = 0.0189) was reported immediately after exercise.Despite SUD individuals having their PFC cerebral oxygenation increased during exercise, they presented lower cognition and oxygenation when compared to controls, especially at elevated intensities. These results may reinforce the role of exercise as an adjuvant treatment to improve PFC function and cognitive control in individuals with SUD."
https://openalex.org/W2767859019,"Background The recently proposed nomogram of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) lacks predictive accuracy for patients with stage D hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Tumor burden is crucial in prognostic prediction but is not included in the criteria of stage D HCC. This study aims to develop a nomogram with tumor burden as the core element for BCLC stage D patients. Methods A total of 386 patients were randomly grouped into derivation and validation sets (1:1 ratio). The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to select factors with significant prognostic effect and generate the nomogram. Concordance indices and calibration plots were used to evaluate the performance of nomogram. Results Overall survival of study patients was significantly associated with tumor burden as well as hepatitis B, serum α-fetoprotein level, cirrhosis and performance status in multivariate Cox regression (all p<0.05). Beta-coefficients of these variables in derivation set were used to generate the nomogram. Each patient was assigned with a total nomogram point that predicted individualized 6-month and 1-year survival. The derivation and validation sets had a c-index of 0.759 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.552–0.923) and 0.741 (95% CI: 0.529–0.913), respectively. The calibration plots were close to the 45-degree line for 6-month and 1-year survival prediction for all quarters of patients in both derivation and validation sets. Conclusion Tumor burden is significantly associated with the outcome for patients with stage D HCC. The tumor burden-incorporated nomogram may serve as a feasible and easy-to-use tool in predicting survival on an individual level."
https://openalex.org/W2767249434,"Loss of protein homeostasis is a hazardous situation that jeopardizes cellular functionality and viability Cells have developed mechanisms that supervise protein integrity and direct misfolded molecules for degradation. Nevertheless, subsets of aggregation-prone proteins escape degradation and form aggregates that can underlie the development of neurodegenerative disorders. In some cases, cells deposit hazardous protein aggregates in desig nated sites, like aggresomes, or secrete them with vesicles. The prion protein (PrP) is an aggregation-prone membrane-anchored glycoprotein, whose aggregation causes familial and sporadic, fatal, neurodegenerative dis eases. The proper maturation of PrP is assisted by cyclophilin B, an endoplasmic reticulum-resident foldase. Ac cordingly, the inhibition of cyclophilins by the drug cyclosporin A (CsA) leads to the accumulation of aggregated PrI and to its deposition in aggresomes. In this study, we asked whether secretion is an alternative strategy that cell adopt to get rid of misfolded PrP molecules and found that, upon treatment with CsA, cells secrete PrP by exosomes, a subtype of secretion vesicles, and by additional types of vesicles. CsA-induced, PrP-containing exosomes originate from the endoplasmic reticulum in a Golgi-independent manner. These findings divulge a new cellular response that is activated upon CsA treatment to secrete misfolded PrP species from the cell and may underlie the spreading of toxic prions among cells and across tissues.—Pan, I., Roitenberg, N., Cohen, E.

This study aimed to investigate the correlation between IGRAs and pulmonary immune responses in tuberculosis contacts in Germany. Methods IGRAs were performed on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and peripheral blood from close healthy contacts of patients with culturally confirmed tuberculosis. Cellular BAL composition was determined by flow cytometry. BAL cells were co-cultured with three strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and Mtb derived antigens including Purified Protein Derivative (PPD), 6 kD Early Secretory Antigenic Target (ESAT-6) and 10 kD Culture Filtrate Protein (CFP-10). Levels of 29 cytokines and chemokines were analyzed in the supernatants by multiplex assay. Associations and effects were examined using linear mixed-effects models. Results There were wide variations of inter-individual cytokine levels in BAL cell culture supernatants. Mycobacterial infection and stimulation with PPD showed a clear induction of several macrophage and lymphocyte associated cytokines, reflecting activation of these cell types. No robust correlation between cytokine patterns and blood IGRA status of the donor was observed, except for slightly higher Interleukin-2 (IL-2) responses in BAL cells from IGRA-positive donors upon mycobacterial infection compared to cells from IGRA-negative donors. Stronger correlations were observed when cytokine patterns were stratified according to BAL IGRA status. BAL cells from donors with BAL IGRA-positive responses produced significantly more IFN-γ and IL-2 upon PPD stimulation and mycobacterial infection than cells from BAL IGRA-negative individuals. Correlations between BAL composition and basal cytokine release from unstimulated cells were suggestive of pre-activated lymphocytes but impaired macrophage activity in BAL IGRA-positive donors, in contrast to BAL IGRA-negative donors. Conclusions In vitro BAL cell cytokine responses to M. tuberculosis antigens or infection do not reflect blood IGRA status but do correlate with stronger cellular responses in BAL IGRA-positive donors. The cytokine patterns observed suggest a pre-activated state of lymphocytes and suppressed macrophage responsiveness in BAL cells from BAL IGRA-positive individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2767994175,"Neuropeptides play an important role in the regulation of feeding in insects and offer potential targets for the development of new chemicals to control insect pests. A pest that has attracted much recent attention is the highly invasive Drosophila suzukii, a polyphagous pest that can cause serious economic damage to soft fruits. Previously we showed by mass spectrometry the presence of the neuropeptide myosuppressin (TDVDHVFLRFamide) in the nerve bundle suggesting that this peptide is involved in regulating the function of the crop, which in adult dipteran insects has important roles in the processing of food, the storage of carbohydrates and the movement of food into the midgut for digestion. In the present study antibodies that recognise the C-terminal RFamide epitope of myosuppressin stain axons in the crop nerve bundle and reveal peptidergic fibres covering the surface of the crop. We also show using an in vitro bioassay that the neuropeptide is a potent inhibitor (EC50 of 2.3 nM) of crop contractions and that this inhibition is mimicked by the non-peptide myosuppressin agonist, benzethonium chloride (Bztc). Myosuppressin also inhibited the peristaltic contractions of the adult midgut, but was a much weaker agonist (EC50 = 5.7 μM). The oral administration of Bztc (5 mM) in a sucrose diet to adult female D. suzukii over 4 hours resulted in less feeding and longer exposure to dietary Bztc led to early mortality. We therefore suggest that myosuppressin and its cognate receptors are potential targets for disrupting feeding behaviour of adult D. suzukii."

For clinical feasibility of kV-MV-CBCT, dose exposure has to be small compared to prescribed dose. In this study, kV-MV dose output is evaluated and compared to clinically-established kV-CBCT. Methods Accurate dose calibration was performed for kV and MV energy; beam quality was determined. For direct comparison of MV and kV dose output, relative biological effectiveness (RBE) was considered. CT dose index (CTDI) was determined and measurements in various representative locations of an inhomogeneous thorax phantom were performed to simulate the patient situation. Results A measured dose of 20.5mGE (Gray-equivalent) in the target region was comparable to kV-CBCT (31.2mGy for widely-used, and 9.1mGy for latest available preset), whereas kV-MV spared healthy tissue and reduced dose to 6.6mGE (30%) due to asymmetric dose distribution. The measured weighted CTDI of 12mGE for kV-MV lay in between both clinical presets. Conclusions Dosimetric properties were in agreement with established imaging techniques, whereas exposure to healthy tissue was reduced. By reducing the imaging time to a single breath-hold of 15s, ultrafast combined kV-MV CBCT shortens patient time at the treatment couch and thus improves patient comfort. It is therefore usable for imaging of hypofractionated lung DIBH patients."
https://openalex.org/W2767549583,"Pressure overload–induced cardiac stress induces left ventricular hypertrophy driven by increased cardiomyocyte mass. The increased energetic demand and cardiomyocyte size during hypertrophy necessitate increased fuel and oxygen delivery and stimulate angiogenesis in the left ventricular wall. We have previously shown that the transcriptional regulator steroid receptor coactivator-2 (SRC-2) controls activation of several key cardiac transcription factors and that SRC-2 loss results in extensive cardiac transcriptional remodeling. Pressure overload in mice lacking SRC-2 induces an abrogated hypertrophic response and decreases sustained cardiac function, but the cardiomyocyte-specific effects of SRC-2 in these changes are unknown. Here, we report that cardiomyocyte-specific loss of SRC-2 (SRC-2 CKO) results in a blunted hypertrophy accompanied by a rapid, progressive decrease in cardiac function. We found that SRC-2 CKO mice exhibit markedly decreased left ventricular vasculature in response to transverse aortic constriction, corresponding to decreased expression of the angiogenic factor VEGF. Of note, SRC-2 knockdown in cardiomyocytes decreased VEGF expression and secretion to levels sufficient to blunt in vitro tube formation and proliferation of endothelial cells. During pressure overload, both hypertrophic and hypoxic signals can stimulate angiogenesis, both of which stimulated SRC-2 expression in vitro. Furthermore, SRC-2 coactivated the transcription factors GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA-4) and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and -2α in response to angiotensin II and hypoxia, respectively, which drive VEGF expression. These results suggest that SRC-2 coordinates cardiomyocyte secretion of VEGF downstream of the two major angiogenic stimuli occurring during pressure overload bridging both hypertrophic and hypoxia-stimulated paracrine signaling."

This study was conducted to elucidate the mechanism of hypophagia in aged female mice exposed to stress. Immediately after a stress load, aged female mice exhibited acute hypophagia and a rise in plasma corticosterone levels. The administration of a serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2CR) antagonist suppressed plasma corticosterone but did not affect the reduction in food intake. In contrast, an endogenous ghrelin enhancer, rikkunshito (RKT), significantly inhibited the reduction in food intake. An increase in peripheral acylated ghrelin levels during fasting, which occurs in young mice, was not observed in aged female mice. Moreover, in these mice, significantly increased levels of ghrelin and gastric preproghrelin mRNA expression were observed in the fed status. Moreover, plasma ghrelin levels were elevated by RKT and not by the 5-HT2CR antagonist. In female mice, the hypothalamic non-edited (INI) and partially edited mRNA 5-HT2CR isoforms (VNV, VNI, VSV or VSI) decreased with age, while in male mice, the editing isoform was unchanged by aging or stress. Estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive cell counts in the arcuate nucleus of young male mice exposed to stress and control aged male mice were increased compared with those in young control mice. In aged male mice exposed to stress, the number of ERα-expressing cells in the paraventricular nucleus were significantly increased compared with those in aged control mice; in female mice, there was no increase in the number of ERα-positive cells. Hypophagia in aged female mice exposed to stress may be independent of 5-HT2CR activation. It seems likely that the mechanisms may be caused by sex dependent, differential regulation in 5-HT2CR mRNA expression, peripheral acylated ghrelin secretion and/or hypothalamic ERα expression."

The growth and development of M. exigua was studied at seven constant temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 27, 30 and 35°C). The results showed that M. exigua eggs failed to hatch at 10°C and the larvae could not complete development at 15 and 35°C. The developmental times of each stage, survival rates of pre-adult, adult longevity, fecundities and oviposition days of M. exigua at 20, 25, 27 and 30°C were investigated using age-stage, two-sex life table. The total pre-adult development time decreased with the increase in temperature decreasing from 61.58 days at 20°C to 28.94 days at 30°C. The highest survival rate was observed at 25°C (73%). Male adult longevities were generally longer than that of females, except at 30°C. The highest mean fecundity, age-stage specific fecundity and age-specific fecundity peak values were all observed at 27°C. The maximum intrinsic rate of increase r and finite rate of increase λ were observed at 27°C, while the maximum net reproduction rate R0 was observed at 25°C. The longest mean generation time occurred at 20°C and the shortest at 27°C. These results provide better understanding on the development, reproduction and dynamic of M. exigua populations, their distribution, and might be utilized to forecast and manage M. exigua outbreaks in China."
https://openalex.org/W2767506459,"Viral entry into host cells is mediated by membrane proteins in a metastable state that transition to a more stable state upon a stimulus. For example, in the influenza envelope protein hemagglutinin (HA), the low pH in the endosome triggers a transition from the metastable prefusion conformation to the stable fusion conformation. To identify probes that interfere with HA function, here we screened a library of H7 HA peptides for inhibition of H7 HA-mediated entry. We discovered a peptide, PEP87 (WSYNAELLVAMENQHTI), that inhibited H7 and H5 HA-mediated entry. PEP87 corresponds to a highly conserved helical region of the HA2 subunit of HA that self-interacts in the neutral pH conformation. Mutagenesis experiments indicated that PEP87 binds to its native region in the HA trimer. We also found that PEP87 is unstructured in isolation but tends to form a helix as evidenced by CD and NMR studies. Fluorescence, chemical cross-linking, and saturation transfer difference NMR data suggested that PEP87 binds to the neutral pH conformation of HA and disrupts the HA structure without affecting its oligomerization state. Together, this work provides support for a model in which PEP87 disrupts HA function by displacing native interactions of the neutral pH conformation. Moreover, our observations indicate that the HA prefusion structure (and perhaps the metastable states of other viral entry proteins) is more dynamic with transient motions being larger than generally appreciated. These findings also suggest that the ensemble of prefusion structures presents many potential sites for targeting in therapeutic interventions."
