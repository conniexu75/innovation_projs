https://openalex.org/W1540426161,"Heat shock induces in cells the development of a transient state of thermotolerance thought to result from the induction of heat shock proteins. To assess directly whether a transient overexpression of one of these proteins, HSP27, can contribute to increased cellular resistance, mouse NIH/3T3 cells were cotransfected with a plasmid containing the Chinese hamster HSP27 gene under the control of the metallothionein promoter and a plasmid containing the neo gene. Stable transfectant cell lines were selected for resistance to the antibiotic G418. Analyses of several stable transfectant cell lines indicated that expression of Chinese hamster HSP27 could be selectively induced by exposure to 3 microM CdCl2, a concentration that had no effect on the induction of the endogenous heat shock proteins (HSP). In clone 15, the level of HSP27 increased steadily during the first day of exposure to CdCl2, from a concentration of 1 microgram/mg of total protein to 7 micrograms/mg. After withdrawal of CdCl2, the level of HSP27 returned to normal within the next 5 days. Accumulation of the Chinese hamster HSP27 was accompanied by a progressive development of thermoresistance that attained a level approaching heat shock-induced thermotolerance. After CdCl2 removal, thermal resistance and HSP27 decayed in a coordinated manner. In control cells transfected with the neo gene only, increased thermoresistance was not induced by 3 microM CdCl2; in these cells, an exposure to 20 microM CdCl2 was required to induce a level of thermoresistance comparable to that induced by 3 microM CdCl2 in clone 15. Elevated expression of HSP27 was accompanied by an increased stability of stress fibers during hyperthermia. The protein also partially prevented actin depolymerization during acute exposure to cytochalasin D and reduced cytotoxicity and growth inhibition of chronic exposures to the drug. The results indicated that accumulation of HSP27, as it occurs after a mild heat shock or other inducing treatments, is sufficient for acquisition of thermotolerance that may result in part from a stabilization of actin filaments."
https://openalex.org/W1547083521,"Incubation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides with 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) results in a pseudo first-order loss of enzyme activity. The pH dependence of the inactivation rate exhibits an inflection around pH 10, and the enzyme is protected from inactivation by glucose 6-phosphate. Loss of enzyme activity corresponds with the formation of one carbonyl function per enzyme subunit and the appearance of a lysine-HNE adduct. The data presented in this paper are consistent with the view that the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue in the glucose 6-phosphate-binding site reacts with the double bond (C3) of HNE, resulting in the formation of a stable secondary amine derivative and loss of enzyme activity. We have described a mechanism by which HNE may, in part, mediate free radical damage. In addition, a method for the detection of the lysine-HNE adduct is introduced."
https://openalex.org/W1510227107,"Macrophage scavenger receptors exhibit unusually broad, but circumscribed, polyanionic ligand-binding specificity. For example, the polyribonucleotides poly(I) and poly(G) are ligands but poly(A) and poly(C) are not. To further investigate the molecular basis of this polynucleotide-binding specificity, we tested the capacity of various oligodeoxyribonucleic acids to inhibit the scavenger receptor-mediated degradation of 125I-labeled acetylated low density lipoprotein by Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the type I bovine scavenger receptor. A series of short oligodeoxyriboguanines (dGn, where 5 < or = n < or = 37) were effective inhibitors. The dG6, dG12, and dA5G37 members of this series were shown by circular dichroism and UV spectroscopy to be assembled into four-stranded helices stabilized by G-quartets. [32P]dA5G37 bound directly to scavenger receptors. Partial or complete denaturation of the quadruplex structures of these oligonucleotides by boiling destroyed their inhibitory activity. Receptor activity was also inhibited by d(T4G4)4, a telomere-like oligonucleotide which forms an intramolecular quadruplex. In addition, conversion of the four-stranded potassium salt of poly(I) to the single-stranded lithium salt dramatically reduced its inhibitory activity. Addition of KCl to the Li+ salt resulted in the reformation of poly(I)'s quadruplex structure and restoration of its inhibitory activity. A variety of single-stranded and double-stranded oligo- and polydeoxyribonucleotides (e.g. dA37, HaeIII restriction fragments of phi X174) exhibited very little or no inhibitory activity. Thus, a base-quartet-stabilized four-stranded helix appears to be a necessary structural determinant for polynucleotide binding to and inhibition of scavenger receptors. This conformational requirement accounts for the previously unexplained polyribonucleotide-binding specificity of scavenger receptors. The spatial distribution of the negatively charged phosphates in polynucleotide quadruplexes may form a charged surface which is complementary to the positively charged surface of the collagenous ligand-binding domain of the scavenger receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1515728609,"Tau protein is a microtubule-associated protein that is almost exclusively expressed in the brain and is enriched in the axon. Determination of tau's sequence has revealed three to four tandem repeats that have been shown to constitute the microtubule binding site. In order to study the functional organization of tau, we prepared a series of truncated tau fragments using an Escherichia coli expression system. We assayed each fragment's activity in promoting growth of microtubules and in nucleating free microtubules. We found that tau's ability to nucleate microtubules requires the presence of additional sequence amino-terminal to that required for growth. We demonstrate that tau's carboxyl and amino termini differentially affect microtubule growth and nucleation. Finally, we show that in vitro microtubule bundle formation occurs when tubulin is assembled in the presence of an amino- and carboxyl-terminally truncated tau protein, whereas almost no bundling is observed in the presence of full-length tau or tau fragments that contain the amino terminus in addition to the repeat domain. We conclude that although the presence of the repeat domain promotes the growth of microtubules, the structural requirements for nucleation activity are more stringent. The differentiation between the growth promoting and nucleation activities on the structural level makes it possible for the two activities to be differentially regulated in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1596581852,"Alkaline phosphatase is anchored to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by a covalently attached glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. We have studied the biosynthetic transport and endocytosis of alkaline phosphatase in the choriocarcinoma cell line BeWo, which endogenously expresses this protein. It was demonstrated that the protein was synthesized as a Triton X-100-soluble precursor. During transport to the cell surface the enzyme was converted in a mature form, which was insoluble in Triton X-100 at 0 degrees C. Once at the cell surface 85% of alkaline phosphatase remained in the detergent-insoluble form. Under steady state conditions 15% of alkaline phosphatase was endocytosed. Most interestingly, this fraction of internalized alkaline phosphatase was completely soluble in Triton X-100 at 0 degrees C. After depletion of membrane cholesterol by saponin, alkaline phosphatase became completely soluble in Triton X-100 at 0 degrees C, suggesting that cholesterol plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of Triton X-100-resistant membrane domains."
https://openalex.org/W1557777477,"Anthrax lethal toxin is a complex of protective antigen (PA, 735 amino acids) and lethal factor (LF, 776 amino acids) that lyses certain eukaryotic cells. LF interacts with PA to gain access to the cytosol to assert its toxicity. The internalization of LF requires that PA bind to a specific membrane receptor and be cleaved by a cell-surface protease (probably furin), so as to expose a site on PA to which LF binds with high affinity. To localize LF functional domains, amino, carboxyl, and internal deletions of LF were made. Toxicity was eliminated by deletion of 40 and 47 residues from the amino and carboxyl termini, respectively. Similarly, deleting the first of the four imperfect repeats of 19 amino acids located at residues 308-383 made LF non-toxic, showing that this region is also essential for activity. To identify the minimum region of LF which is required for binding to PA, varying amino-terminal portions of LF were fused to the ADP-ribosylation domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A. Fusion proteins containing residues 1-254 of LF were toxic when administered with PA, while those having only residues 1-198 of LF were inactive, showing that the PA-binding domain of LF lies within residues 1-254."
https://openalex.org/W1504092669,"Macrophage scavenger receptors have been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis and other macrophage-associated functions, including host defense. The mechanism by which these receptors bind a wide array of polyanions, such as acetylated low density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL), with high affinity has not yet been elucidated; however, it has been proposed that the positively charged extracellular collagenous domain of scavenger receptors plays a key role in ligand binding. To test this proposal, we generated truncation mutants of the bovine and murine scavenger receptors and studied their expression in transiently transfected COS cells. These mutants contain only 8 (bovine) or 5 (murine) of the 24 Gly-X-Y tripeptide repeats found in the collagenous domains of the full-length receptors. Immunochemical analyses established that the truncation of the bovine scavenger receptor did not interfere significantly with its synthesis, trimerization, post-translational processing, intracellular transport, surface expression, or stability. However, unlike their full-length counterparts, the truncated bovine and murine receptors were unable to bind Ac-LDL. Thus, the collagenous domain was necessary for normal ligand binding. In addition, cotransfection of the expression vector for the truncated bovine scavenger receptor with that for the full-length receptor resulted in dramatically reduced activity of the full-length construct (dominant negative effect). A ligand bead-binding assay was used to show that the isolated collagenous domain from a different protein, complement component C1q, could bind a wide variety of polyanions with a specificity which was similar, but not identical, to that of scavenger receptors. These results suggest that the collagenous domain of the scavenger receptor is both necessary and sufficient to determine the broad binding specificity that characterizes this unusual receptor. Scavenger receptors and C1q, along with the mannose-binding protein, conglutinin, and lung surfactant apoprotein A, help define a set of proteins which all contain short collagenous domains and which all appear to participate in host defense. Their short collagenous domains may contribute significantly to their host-defense functions."
https://openalex.org/W1638665100,"The gene encoding the human endothelin-B receptor (hET-BR) has been isolated, and its structural organization and chromosomal assignment have been determined. Southern blot analysis demonstrated a single copy of the hET-BR gene in the human genome. The hET-BR gene spans 24 kilobases and consists of seven exons and six introns. The size range for exons is 109-2855 base pairs, although that for introns is 0.2-14.5 kilobases. Every intron occurs near the border of the putative transmembrane domain in the coding region. The major transcription initiation sites were mapped to the positions 258 and 229 base pairs upstream of the ATG initiation codon by primer extension and nuclease S1 protection experiments. The 5'-flanking region of the hET-BR gene lacks conventional TATA and CCAAT boxes but contains a sequence of potential Sp1 binding sites upstream of the transcription initiation sites. There are some canonical consensus sequences of cis-elements including GATA motif, acute phase reactant regulatory element, and E box. Using human-rodent somatic hybrid cell lines, the hET-BR gene was assigned to human chromosome 13. The present study will lead to a better understanding of the mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of the hET-BR gene and will give a clue as to how to search for possible genetic disorders of hET-BR."
https://openalex.org/W1555403344,"Asparaginyl endopeptidase was highly purified from mature seeds of the jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis). The final enzyme preparation showed a single peak in high-performance liquid chromatography on a reversed-phase column, and the material in the peak gave the following NH2-terminal amino acid sequence on Edman degradation for 25 cycles: H-Glu-Val-Gly-Thr-Arg-Trp-Ala-Val-Leu-Val-Ala-Gly-Ser-Asn-Gly-Tyr-Gly-Asn-Tyr- Arg-His-Gln-Ala-Asp-Val-. Behavior of the enzyme toward various protease inhibitors suggested that it belongs to a family of cysteine proteases. Strict substrate specificity of this enzyme was verified by the use of 14 polypeptide substrates including those derived from proteins. Almost all the peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of Asn residues were susceptible to the enzyme. The exceptions were cases where the residue was at the NH2 terminus or the second position from the NH2 terminus of substrates and where it was N-glycosylated Asn. Peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of any other amino acid residues were not cleaved. These properties promise the high utility of this novel endopeptidase in protein sequence analysis. Identity of jack bean asparaginyl endopeptidase with a processing enzyme responsible for maturation of concanavalin A from its precursor is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1499415175,"The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (subtype A) is located in nerve terminals and catalyses coupled electrogenic uptake of the neurotransmitter with two or three sodium and one chloride ions. It contains 599 amino acids and 12 putative membrane spanning alpha-helices and is the first described member of a neurotransmitter transporter superfamily. The membrane domain contains 5 charged amino acids which are basically conserved. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that only one of them, arginine 69, is absolutely essential for activity. It is located in a highly conserved region encompassing parts of helices 1 and 2. The three other positively charged amino acids and the only negative charged one, glutamate 467, are not critical. These results suggest that the translocation pathway of the sodium ions through the membrane does not involve charged amino acid residues and underline the importance of the highly conserved stretch between amino acids 66 and 86."
https://openalex.org/W1575305733,"High levels of fluid shear stress at the blood vessel wall directly stimulate von Willebrand factor (vWF)-mediated platelet adhesion and aggregation and thereby contribute to the pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis. We have found that a pathological level of arterial wall shear stress (90 dynes/cm2) induces platelet aggregation that is associated with the phosphorylation of pleckstrin, a M(r) 47,000 protein kinase C substrate (p47). Shear-induced p47 phosphorylation depends entirely on vWF binding to platelet glycoprotein (Gp) Ib and GpIIb-IIIa, and the specific inhibition of protein kinase C with the staurosporine analogue Ro 31-7549 inhibits the full aggregation response to shear. Shear stress-induced platelet p47 phosphorylation occurs independent of any measurable change in diacylglycerol mass or hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. These results indicate that mechanical shear stress induces vWF to bind to platelet GpIb and GpIIb-IIIa, stimulating a diacylglycerol-independent pathway of protein kinase C activation that contributes to platelet aggregation in response to shear."
https://openalex.org/W1588816757,"The 5'-untranslated region of the mouse acetylcholinesterase gene has been characterized structurally by RNase protection, primer extension, and sequencing. Evidence has been obtained for the use of two alternative promoters in brain. Tissue-specific splicing to alternative acceptor sites in the 5'-untranslated exons occurs in brain, muscle, and erythropoietic cells. cis elements 5' of the cap site that is predominantly used in these tissues and cells have been analyzed by deletion analysis of promoter-reporter gene constructs and by site-specific mutagenesis. The cap site is found 107 base pairs (bp) 5' of the translation start site. This region is devoid of CAAT or TATA sequences; further in the 5' direction 50 and 70 bp are tandem Egr-1 sites. The putative promoter has been coupled to the open reading frame of a luciferase reporter gene. Deletion analysis shows that this region largely accounts for tissue-specific transcription seen upon transfection of neuronal and muscle cells. Mutagenesis of the Egr-1 sites results in a marked loss of reporter gene activity, further substantiating the importance of this region in the control of transcription. cis elements in the promoter differ from those found for the genes encoding the various subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and distinct differences in control of transcription are evident when the respective reporter genes are transfected into C2 muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2145343681,"The intracellular site of assembly of hepatic very low density lipoproteins has been investigated. Two endoplasmic reticulum fractions and Golgi vesicles (relatively free from endosomal contamination) were isolated from rat liver and the luminal contents were released. The apoB-containing entities were separated from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi vesicles by an immunoaffinity isolation procedure. The amount of each lipid moiety (triacylglycerols, cholesterol plus cholesteryl esters and phospholipids) associated with a unit mass of apoB was shown to be very similar in the luminal contents isolated from each of the three fractions. Moreover, the apoB-containing particles that were isolated from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi were mainly present in a fraction of density < 1.02 g/ml. The average diameter of these lipoprotein particles was shown by negative staining electron microscopy to be in the size range of very low density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins. The size and composition of the intracellular lipoproteins were very similar to those of both very low density lipoproteins isolated from the culture medium from rat hepatocytes and plasma very low density lipoproteins. The conclusion from this study is that the full complement of lipids associate with apoB at an early stage during the secretory pathway, in the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1608124784,"Four aspartic acids, distributed in different putative membrane-spanning segments of the NH2-terminal domain of melibiose (mel) permease (D31 in helix I, D51 and D55 in helix II, and D120 in helix IV) were individually replaced by either Asn or Cys using site-directed mutagenesis. mel permease with either neutral residues at position 51, 55, or 120 or permease with a Cys in place of D31 does not catalyze significant Na(+)-linked methyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside (TMG) accumulation. Binding studies of a high affinity ligand (p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside (NPG)) on de-energized membrane vesicles indicate that these modified transporters (i) retain the ability to bind the alpha-galactosides NPG or melibiose and the beta-galactoside TMG and (ii) exhibit a Na(+)-independent sugar-binding phenotype. In contrast, mel permease with an Asn residue at position 31 mediates Na(+)-coupled TMG transport and displays a Na(+)-dependent sugar binding phenotype, but requires a higher concentration of sodium than wild-type permease to produce maximal stimulation of sugar binding. The observation that individual mutation of the Asp residue at position 31, 51, 55, or 120 systematically and selectively modifies the contribution of the coupling ion to the early step of the transport reaction, i.e. cosubstrate binding, raises the possibility that (i) these 4 aspartic residues are at or near the cationic binding site of mel permease, (ii) the NH2-terminal domain of mel permease in which they are distributed accommodates or is part of the cationic binding site, and (iii) the oxygen atoms of these Asp side chains contribute to coordination of the coupling ion."
https://openalex.org/W1551779607,"We have previously observed enhanced binding of HDL and apolipoproteins A-I and A-II to human endothelial cells exposed to activated complement. Induction of these binding sites required complement activation through C9, suggesting a specific role for the C9 component of the C5b-9 complex. We now report that specific and saturable binding sites for apoA-I and -A-II are expressed by C9 polymers (polyC9), whereas little binding was observed to native monomeric C9. These data suggested an interaction of the apoproteins with a site(s) which is exposed only upon C9 polymerization, and also suggested that binding of the apoproteins to this new site might interfere with assembly of C9 into the polyC9 tubule and insertion into the cell membrane. ApoA-I was found to inhibit zinc-catalyzed polymerization of C9 in a concentration-dependent fashion. Formation of SDS-resistant C9 polymers was completely inhibited at apoA-I or -A-II concentrations > or = 5 microM. ApoA-I also produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of C9 incorporation into C5b-9 complexes on endothelial cells, which was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in SDS-resistant C9 polymers associated with the cell membrane. In summary, the ability of the HDL apoproteins A-I and A-II to interact with an activation-dependent conformer(s) of the C9 component of the C5b-9 complex appears to explain the expression of HDL binding sites on endothelial cells exposed to complement. These apoproteins are also inhibitors of C9 polymerization, which may underlie the protective effect of HDL for blood cells exposed to activated complement."
https://openalex.org/W1526058544,"Abstract Glycoprotein IX is a relatively small (M(r) 20,000) surface glycoprotein of human platelets; one of three (Ib alpha, Ib beta, IX) polypeptide chains present in the glycoprotein Ib-IX complex that functions as the von Willebrand factor receptor and mediates platelet adhesion in the arterial circulation. Using a cDNA for human glycoprotein IX as the probe, clones were isolated from a human genomic library, and the genomic sequence for glycoprotein IX (3.2 kilobases) was determined. The transcriptional start site was located by RNase protection and primer extension experiments. The gene includes three exons and two introns within 1.6 kilobases of DNA, and the entire open reading frame for glycoprotein IX is included within the third exon. The genes for glycoproteins IX and Ib alpha share similar exon sequences on the 5' side of their ATG start codons, and both genes possess introns in this region. The glycoprotein IX gene contains two consensus regulatory sequences (GATA and ACTTCCT [ets]) in its promoter region (5' flank, within 67 bases of the start site) that are also present in similar sites in the previously described genes (glycoprotein IIb, platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin: human and rat). Thus, the glycoprotein IX gene shares structural features with other megakaryocyte-platelet genes and contains at least two consensus cis-acting regulatory elements that may govern gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1561471115,"The single-stranded oligomer Q, whose nucleotide sequence 5'-d(TACAGGGGAGCTGGGGTAGA)-3' corresponds to the IgG switch region, forms in concentrated solutions and in the presence of alkali metal cation parallel four-stranded complexes termed G4 DNA (Sen, D., and Gilbert, W. (1988) Nature 334, 364-366). We show that G4 DNA was also formed during storage of dried oligomer Q. This quadruplex complex migrated more slowly than mono-strand oligomer Q during nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, the rate of its formation depended on the mass of stored oligomer Q, and N7 positions of guanine residues were involved in its stabilization. Here we report the purification of a protein designated QUAD that binds specifically to the G4 form of oligomer Q, from non-histone protein extracts of rabbit hepatocytes. QUAD was 80-90% purified by sequential steps of column chromatography on Sepharose 6B, DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, and phenyl-Sepharose. Purified QUAD migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a 58 +/- 2.6-kDa polypeptide and had a native molecular mass of 57 +/- 2.5 kDa as determined by Sepharose 6B gel filtration. The dissociation constant of G4 DNA binding to QUAD was in the range of 2.5 to 7.0 x 10(-9) M/liter. Excess unlabeled monostranded oligomer Q did not compete with 5'-32P-labeled G4 DNA on its binding to QUAD. Further, that QUAD recognized the G4 DNA structure rather than a DNA sequence was also demonstrated by the inefficient competition on the binding of 5'-[32P]G4 DNA to QUAD by excess unlabeled single- or double-stranded DNA molecules that contained guanine clusters of different length or various other nucleotide sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1590145665,"The G protein alpha subunit Gz alpha is a substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinase C. The phosphorylation has been documented both in human platelets and in vitro and is characterized by a high degree of selectivity in relation to other G protein alpha subunits. We have demonstrated previously by phosphoamino acid analysis and CNBr peptide mapping that phosphorylation occurs at a serine residue(s) within the NH2-terminal 53 residues of Gz alpha. In this study, we have examined the site of phosphorylation using site-directed mutagenesis. Gz alpha variants containing selected substitutions of alanine for serine residues were expressed in human kidney 293 cells, and the ability of each to be phosphorylated in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was examined. A focus was placed on Ser25 and Ser27, the 2 serine residues within a sequence of Gz alpha used to obtain a phosphorylation-sensitive antibody. The results demonstrate that Ser27 is the primary site of phosphorylation. Conversion of Ser27 to an alanine resulted in a 65% decrease in incorporation of [32P] phosphate; conversion of Ser25 had no effect. Conversion of Ser16, which like Ser25 and Ser27 conforms to a consensus site for protein kinase C, resulted in a modest (15%) decrease. The conversion of both Ser16 and Ser27 resulted in an 80% suppression of incorporation. In addition to these results, we have extended studies of the subunit and kinase selectivity of phosphorylation in platelets. We show here that under conditions promoting phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated phosphorylation of Gz alpha in permeabilized platelets, Gq alpha is not phosphorylated. Moreover, Gi alpha, Gz alpha, and Gq alpha were not phosphorylated in response to analogues of cAMP or cGMP. Thus, only Gz alpha is phosphorylated in platelets and only in response to activation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1626109030,"When cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are grown to stationary phase in medium containing [3H] inositol, significant amounts of radioactivity can be detected in phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Addition of glucose to such cultures results in the generation of [3H]glycerophosphoinositol, [3H]glycerophosphoinositol 4-phosphate, and [3H]glycerophosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in the extracellular medium. We found no evidence, however, for the stimulated formation of other inositol polyphosphates. This result suggests that glucose does not stimulate the phospholipase C signalling pathway established in higher eukaryotic cells but, in contrast, stimulates specific phospholipases A or B. A variety of cell division cycle (cdc) mutants have been studied to investigate the relationship between cell cycle progression and inositol metabolism in S. cerevisiae. Mutants which are defective for completion of cell cycle START (i.e. commitment to mitosis) show reduced formation of glycerophosphoinositol 4-phosphate and glycerophosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in response to glucose. In contrast, cdc mutants which are defective in post-START processes show a larger glucose response than wild type cells. These results suggest that deacylation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate may be coordinated with cell cycle control in S. cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W1585164297,"Individual substitution of Cys or Asn for Asp-31, Asp-51, Asp-55, or Asp-120, distributed in different membrane spanning segments of the NH2-terminal domain of melibiose (mel) permease partially or completely inactivates Na(+)-linked sugar transport and stimulation of sugar binding on mel permease by Na+ ions (Pourcher, T., Zani, M.-L., and Leblanc, G. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 3209-3215). To investigate further the effect of these substitutions on the cationic selectivity and coupling properties of mel permease, H(+)-melibiose coupled transport, coupling between H+ and melibiose movements, sugar counterflow, and zero-trans sugar efflux by the mutant permeases were analyzed. The results provide additional evidence indicating that manipulation of some of these Asp in the membrane-spanning segments of mel permease alters its cationic selectivity properties. The results also indicate that the individual mutations diversely affect mel permease-coupling properties. For example, only permease with Asn in place of Asp-31 or Cys in place of Asp-51 retains the capacity to actively transport melibiose. On the other hand, replacing Asp-55 by Cys produces uncoupling of cosubstrate flows by the carrier but does not hamper sugar translocation. These and other features of the mutant permeases are used to discuss the relative participation of Asp-31, Asp-51, Asp-55, or Asp-120 to the mel symport mechanism and to its ionic selectivity and also the existence of a possible gating mechanism that may contribute the obligatory coupling of cosubstrate flows by the symporter."
https://openalex.org/W1608650725,"The P1 plasmid prophage is partitioned by a very high affinity protein complex at its partition site, parS, that contains the P1 ParB protein and Escherichia coli integration host factor (IHF). ParB binds to regions of parS that flank the IHF binding site. In this report, we have examined the sequences to which ParB binds, the spatial relationship between them, and the effect of IHF on ParB binding patterns. Methylation protection and interference experiments were performed on supercoiled plasmids. Mutations that interfered with the action of both proteins in vivo were identified following random mutagenesis of parS. These studies revealed that ParB binds to a complicated, nonsymmetrical region in the right side of parS. ParB recognizes a partial copy of this sequence, TCGCCA, in the left side of parS with much lower affinity. The presence of IHF greatly facilitates the interaction of ParB with parS such that both sides bind with an equal affinity that is much greater than to either side alone. The stimulation by IHF is strongly influenced by helical phasing. These observations support the proposal that ParB is directed, by the bend created by IHF, to bind simultaneously to properly placed sequences flanking the IHF site."
https://openalex.org/W2110700383,"Abstract In this study, we examined the effect of phosphorylation on GLUT-4 function in isolated rat adipocytes. Adipocytes labeled with 32P for 2 h were incubated with parathyroid hormone (PTH) (20 ng/ml) for 60 min and then exposed to insulin (25 ng/ml) for an additional 30 min. 32P-GLUT-4 was immunoprecipitated from the plasma membrane and low density microsomal fractions, and its degree of phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography and densitometry. Results were expressed as 32P-GLUT-4 specific activity (phosphorylation/unit of protein). GLUT-4 intrinsic activity was measured using [14C]2-deoxyglucose uptake in plasma membrane vesicles. PTH significantly increased GLUT-4 phosphorylation and eliminated the insulin-stimulated dephosphorylation of GLUT-4. Western blotting revealed normal distribution of GLUT-4 before and after insulin stimulation in control and PTH-treated cells, suggesting that phosphorylation of GLUT-4 does not interfere with its recruitment to the plasma membrane. In contrast, intrinsic activity of phosphorylated GLUT-4 was significantly reduced (p < 0.01). Preincubation of adipocytes with calcium channel blocker (nitrendipine) and cyclic AMP antagonist (RpcAMP) restored GLUT-4 intrinsic activity in the PTH-treated cells. In several experiments, GLUT-4 was phosphorylated in vitro in plasma membrane vesicles isolated from normal adipocytes exposed to insulin. This in vitro phosphorylation reduced GLUT-4 intrinsic activity by approximately 35% (p < 0.01). We conclude that phosphorylation of GLUT-4 significantly impairs the ability of insulin to stimulate its intrinsic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1484686491,"Previous work in multiple cell types has shown that endogenous GH receptors, as well as the cloned liver GH receptor, associate with a tyrosine kinase. However, in SDS-PAGE gels of highly purified, kinase-active GH receptor preparations from 35S-labeled 3T3-F442A cells, only one broad band was detected corresponding to the molecular weight of the GH receptor rather than two bands which might be expected to result from a kinase-receptor heterocomplex. In the present study, a transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line (CHO4) that expresses an 84-kDa GH receptor rather than a 121-kDa GH receptor was used to examine whether the GH receptor might form a complex with a protein (e.g. tyrosine kinase) that comigrates on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels with the endogenous GH receptor (M(r) 121,000) in 3T3-F442A cells. GH-GH receptor complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-GH antibody from GH-treated CHO4 cells and incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP. 32P was incorporated into a 121-kDa protein as well as the 84-kDa GH receptor. Phosphorylation of both the 84-kDa GH receptor and the 121-kDa protein was on tyrosyl residues as determined by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The 121-kDa protein does not appear to bind GH. It was also not detected in the immunoprecipitate when cells had not been incubated with GH or when untransfected CHO cells were used. These findings suggest that in CHO4 cells, the 121-kDa protein is precipitated by the GH antibody because of its ability to form a complex with the GH receptor (p84). Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed that GH promotes the tyrosyl phosphorylation of a 121-kDa protein and several other proteins (p97, p42, p39) in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Taken together, these findings are consistent with either p121 being the tyrosine kinase that complexes with the GH receptor and is activated in response to GH binding or with p121 forming a ternary complex with both the GH receptor and a tyrosine kinase and serving as a substrate of the GH receptor-associated tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1587190882,"The rat and human forms of the T-cell surface glycoprotein CD4 share a common glycosylation site at the Asn270/271 position but differ with respect to the locations of the second glycosylation sites at Asn159 (rat) and Asn300 (human). The glycosylation of soluble recombinant forms of human and rat CD4 (sCD4) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells has been characterized. The most obvious differences between the rat and human sCD4 oligosaccharides were the greater abundance of oligomannose and hybrid oligosaccharides on rat sCD4 and the presence of oligosaccharides carrying a terminal alpha-galactose residue on human sCD4. This is the first report of the occurrence of alpha-galactose residues on a glycoprotein expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Comparison of mutant rat sCD4 molecules with single glycosylation sites and glycopeptides indicated that site-specific and independent processing occurred at each glycosylation site. The glycosylation at the conserved site at Asn270 of rat sCD4 was identical to that seen for the equivalent site in human sCD4, and the oligomannose and hybrid structures were restricted to the nonconserved site at Asn159 in rat sCD4. However, there was more oligosaccharide processing at this site in a truncated form of rat sCD4 consisting of the two NH2-terminal domains. These results indicate that not only the local three-dimensional structure but also domain interactions can influence the processing at individual glycosylation sites."
https://openalex.org/W1599255220,"In isolated mitochondria extensive uptake of Ca2+ in the presence of an inducing agent, e.g. inorganic phosphate (Pi), causes permeabilization of the mitochondrial inner membrane and a collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential. In this study we tested whether the effect of phosphate occurs in intact hepatocytes. Rat hepatocytes were incubated with ATP to induce a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and cell death (Zoeteweij, J. P., van de Water, B., de Bont, H. J. G. M., Mulder, G. J., and Nagelkerke, J. F. (1992) Biochem. J. 288, 207-213). Omission of Pi from the incubation medium delayed the loss of viability. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analog adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S) had similar effects on [Ca2+]i and viability, but now omission of extracellular Pi completely protected against cytotoxicity. Exposure to ATP or ATP gamma S induced a large cellular uptake of Pi. With the use of video-microscopy a significant increase in mitochondrial free calcium was observed before the onset of cell death. Accumulation of mitochondrial calcium was reduced when extracellular Pi was omitted. These results suggest that, after induction of high [Ca2+]i by ATP in hepatocytes, 1) mitochondria accumulate calcium which is associated with cell toxicity and 2) intracellular Pi increases which stimulates mitochondrial calcium uptake. These observations support a calcium-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction, induced by phosphate, as a valid model for ATP-induced cytotoxicity in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1553470727,"Thrombin is a multifunctional serine protease that plays a critical role in hemostasis. Thrombin is inhibited by the serpins antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II in a reaction that is dramatically accelerated by glycosaminoglycans. The structural basis of the interaction with these inhibitors was investigated by introducing single amino acid substitutions into the anion-binding exosite (R68E, R70E) and unique insertion loops (K52E, K154A) of thrombin. The rate of inhibition of these recombinant thrombins by antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II was determined in the absence and presence of glycosaminoglycan. The second order rate constant (k2) for inhibition by antithrombin III without heparin was 3.7 x 10(5) M-1 min-1 for wild-type thrombin; rates for the mutant thrombins varied less than 2-fold. For inhibition by antithrombin III with heparin, the rate constant was 4.5 x 10(8) M-1 min-1 for wild-type thrombin with no significant differences between any of the recombinant thrombins. In contrast, the rate constant for inhibition by heparin cofactor II without glycosaminoglycan was 4.3 x 10(4) M-1 min-1 for wild-type thrombin; rates were 10-fold slower for thrombin K52E and 2- to 3-fold slower for thrombins R68E and R70E. The rate constants for inhibition of wild-type thrombin by HCII in the presence of heparin or dermatan sulfate were 9.2 x 10(8) M-1 min-1 and 9.0 x 10(8) M-1 min-1, respectively. Compared to wild-type thrombin, the rate of inhibition by HCII with glycosaminoglycan was 5- to 15-fold slower for thrombins K52E and R70E and 50- to over 100-fold slower for thrombin R68E. Thrombin K154A was inhibited by heparin cofactor II with rates similar to wild-type thrombin in all assays. These results suggest that heparin cofactor II interacts with residue Lys-52 in the proposed S1' subsite and with residues Arg-68 and Arg-70 in the anion-binding exosite of thrombin, and that these interactions contribute to the molecular basis of heparin cofactor II specificity for thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1590602771,"The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei derives its metabolic energy exclusively from a unique type of glycolysis in which pyruvate derived from glucose catabolism is released into the host bloodstream. In this study, this terminal metabolic step has been examined in detail. Pyruvate release from trypanosomal cells supplied with glucose is very rapid, proceeding with an apparent Vmax of 214 nmol x min-1 x mg-1. Counterflow experiments with [14C]pyruvate demonstrate that this metabolic end product can be taken up by actively metabolizing cells consistent with the presence of a plasma membrane transporter. The findings that [14C] acetate exhibits a much lower capacity for cell entry and that the structural analog alpha-cyano-3-hydroxycinnamic acid inhibits pyruvate release provide additional support for the presence of a pyruvate transporter. The substrate analog and alkylating agent 3-bromopyruvate inhibits completely both cell motility and pyruvate release. Surprisingly, however, it is a poor inhibitor of pyruvate transport per se. Rather, its preferential site of action and that of iodoacetic acid were identified by radiolabeling studies and microsequence analysis as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. In extending these studies, 3-bromopyruvate was found to be over 20 times less effective in inhibiting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in intact erythrocytes than in trypanosomal cells. However, in sonicated preparations from both cell types, the enzyme exhibits nearly identical sensitivities to inhibition by 3-bromopyruvate. Experiments reported here provide the first direct evidence that pyruvate release in African trypanosomes is catalyzed by a specific transport system and implicate this transporter as a vehicle for delivering toxic alkylating agents into trypanosomal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1598192423,"Using the T7 RNA polymerase expression system, a modified plasmid vector has been developed which gives reliable, high level expression in Escherichia coli of the gene encoding streptococcal NADH peroxidase. The recombinant enzyme has been purified to homogeneity using a revised protocol which yields over 35 mg of pure protein per liter of culture. Recombinant NADH peroxidase is fully active and exhibits spectroscopic and redox properties identical to those for the enzyme purified from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1. Reductive titrations and thiol analyses confirm the presence of the unusual cysteine-sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) redox center identified previously. N-terminal sequence analysis, analytical gel filtration, and preliminary x-ray diffraction data all confirm the structural identity of the recombinant and S. faecalis enzymes. Steady-state kinetic analysis of the peroxidase, coupled with results from static titration experiments is consistent with a limiting type of ternary complex mechanism and allows the determination of many of the corresponding kinetic constants. In addition, preliminary 1H NMR spectra of the enzyme at millimolar concentrations show good dispersion in the amide region and indicate that the recombinant peroxidase is suitable for one-dimensional NMR work with labeled amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1480892540,"This paper addresses, in thermodynamic and kinetic terms, the reasons for the acidic lipid specificity of the human prothrombinase complex. We obtained, from the measured lipid titrations of the initial rates of prothrombin activation, the empirical binding constants for prothrombinase assembly on different membranes. These favored assembly on phosphatidylserine (PS)- as opposed to phosphatidylglycerol (PG)-containing membranes. In addition, we have used full time courses of prothrombin activation, in conjunction with a calculation of the equilibrium distribution of factor Xa between four enzymatic forms, to obtain the intrinsic kinetic constants of the prothrombinase assembled on PS- or PG-containing membranes. The resulting values of kcat, Km, and kcat/Km increased as acidic lipid content increased, and kcat/Km reached a plateau at 12 mol % PS and 50 mol % PG. Using the measured assembly and kinetic constants, the observed shapes of the phospholipid titration curves of human prothrombin activation were interpreted. We conclude that the difference in activity of prothrombinase assembled on PS- versus PG-containing membranes results both from the different binding properties of factors Xa and Va to these surfaces and from the different intrinsic activities of the prothrombinase when assembled on different membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1488868281,"Abstract Activated phagocytes produce large amounts of reactive oxygen intermediates, including peroxides. In addition to their microbicidal effect, it has recently been suggested that reactive oxygen species play a role as intracellular messengers. The mechanism of action remains unknown, but peroxides have been reported to increase tyrosine phosphorylation, an effect potentiated by vanadate. In this report we studied the effects of a combination of H2O2 and vanadate on Ca2+ homeostasis in granulocytic HL60 cells. The peroxides induced a transient elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+] associated with release from internal stores. Ca2+ mobilization was accompanied by increased generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, implicating phospholipase C (PLC). A sizable increase in phosphotyrosine accumulation by several polypeptides in the M(r) 20,000 to 250,000 range preceded the [Ca2+] changes. We therefore considered the possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation of a phospholipase mediates the observed effects. Differentiated (granulocytic) HL60 cells did not have detectable levels of PLC gamma 1 but had substantial PLC gamma 2. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that PLC gamma 2 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon treatment of the cells with peroxides of vanadate. If associated with activation, such phosphorylation of PLC gamma 2 can account for the rise in [Ca2+]. Although capable of mobilizing internal Ca2+ stores, the peroxides failed to produce the sustained [Ca2+] increase predicted by the capacitative model. Mn2+ influx determinations indicated that this is due to impairment of divalent cation entry by the peroxides, uncoupling the plasma membrane from the internal stores. Changes in [Ca2+] homeostasis could mediate some of the messenger actions of reactive oxygen species."
https://openalex.org/W1553101481,"The platelet glycoproteins GPIIb and GPIIIa are integral membrane proteins and form calcium-dependent heterodimers in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the absence of heterodimer formation, GPIIb and GPIIIa are retained in the ER and degraded. To produce soluble forms of these proteins, we truncated each at a site just proximal to its transmembrane anchor and expressed the mutants in COS-1 cells. We found that both truncated GPIIIa (GPIIIatr) and GPIIIatr were secreted by the transfected cells. However, GPIIbtr was retained by the cells and was immunoprecipitated as a doublet with a 115,000 molecular weight protein. Incubation of transfected cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 or the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl) ester (BAPTA-AM) failed to induce appreciable GPIIbtr secretion, suggesting that formation of intracellular calcium complexes was not a factor in GPIIbtr retention. Further, immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated GPIIbtr and GPIIIatr revealed that the chaperone binding protein (BiP) was associated with each, arguing that BiP alone was not responsible for GPIIbtr retention. These studies indicate that the intracellular retention of GPIIIa involves sequences located in the transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains of the molecule. GPIIb contains an additional retention signal located in the extracellular portion of the molecule whose effect is abrogated by formation of a GPIIb-IIIa heterodimer. This signal may be involved in the fate of nascent GPIIb monomers and the generation of correctly configured GPIIb-IIIa heterodimers."
https://openalex.org/W1590734147,The terminal electron transfer enzyme Me2SO reductase of Escherichia coli is a heterotrimeric enzyme composed of a membrane extrinsic catalytic dimer (DmsAB) and a membrane intrinsic polytopic anchor subunit (DmsC). The topology of DmsC has been studied using phoA (alkaline phosphatase) and blaM (beta-lactamase) gene fusions. The results of analyzing the properties of proteins produced by the fusions suggests a structure with eight transmembrane helices. Both the amino and carboxyl termini are exposed to the periplasm. The entire DmsC polypeptide is necessary to anchor DmsAB to the membrane as fusions with truncated DmsC were not functional and soluble DmsAB accumulated in the cytoplasm. A dmsC-phoA fusion in the termination codon of dmsC generated a chimeric enzyme with functional Me2SO reductase and alkaline phosphatase activity. Quantitation of the minimal inhibitory concentration of ampicillin for the dmsC-blaM fusions indicated that different transmembrane helices had differing signal sequence activity.
https://openalex.org/W1918788452,"Abstract The beta Gly-149 residue is in a glycine-rich sequence (Gly-Gly-Ala-Gly-Val-Gly-Lys-Thr; residues 149-156) of the Escherichia coli H(+)-ATPase (ATP synthase) beta subunit. Substitution of beta Gly-149 by Ser suppressed the effect of the beta Ser-174-->Phe mutation (Iwamoto, A., Omote, H., Hanada, H., Tomioka, N., Itai, A., Maeda, M., and Futai, M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 16350-16355), suggesting that beta Gly-149 is located near beta Ser-174. In this study, we introduced different residues at position 149 and found that a single mutant beta Cys-149 was defective. The effect of beta Cys-149 mutation was suppressed by beta Gly-172-->Glu, beta Ser-174-->Phe, beta Glu-192-->Val, or beta Val-198-->Ala replacement. These results suggest that beta Gly-149, beta Gly-172, beta Ser-174, beta Glu-192, and beta Val-198 residues are located close together in the catalytic site. From these findings we propose a model of the catalytic site of the enzyme near the gamma phosphate moiety of ATP. F1 enzymes with the double mutations beta Cys-149/beta Glu-172, beta Cys-149/beta Phe-174, beta Cys-149/beta Val-192, and beta Cys-149/beta Ala-198 were less sensitive than wild-type F1 to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and adenosine triphosphopyridoxal (an affinity analogue of ATP forming a Schiff base with the epsilon-amino group of beta Lys-155 or beta Lys-201), and became sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide in an ATP-protected manner. These results of inhibitor studies are consistent with the proposed model."
https://openalex.org/W1529209203,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) binds to heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. We have employed site-directed mutagenesis to dissect one of the proposed heparin binding domains of avian LPL, which contains the sequence Arg-Lys-Asn-Arg (amino acids 281-284). Various single, double, and triple mutants of chicken LPL were constructed in order to alter the positive charge of this region. The mutant and wild-type cDNAs were subcloned into an expression vector, pRc/CMV, and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In general, the LPL mutants with a decrease in regional positive charge showed a decrease in affinity for heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The greatest effect was seen with the triple mutant, LPL 5G, in which all of the positively charged amino acids were altered to neutral residues. On a heparin-Sepharose column, LPL 5G eluted at 0.96 M NaCl compared with 1.35 M for wild-type LPL. This mutant also had the lowest specific activity with 1.5 mu eq fatty acid/micrograms/h for the cell-associated pool and with no detectable activity in the media. Wild-type cells, however, produced a lipase with a specific activity of 12.4 and 13.1 mu eq fatty acid/micrograms/h for cell-associated and media lipase pools, respectively. LPL 5G also showed a decrease in affinity for the heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface of Chinese hamster ovary cells. In conclusion, the region of avian LPL between Arg281 and Arg284 does appear to be involved in heparin-binding; however, additional regions must be involved since binding was not completely abolished. In addition, specific activity of the cell-associated and secreted LPL is correlated to affinity of the enzyme for heparan sulfate chains."
https://openalex.org/W1562440313,"The present study, utilizing the hormone-responsive rat thyroid cell line FRTL-5, presents evidence establishing the regulatory role of thyrotropin in modulating mRNA for beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialytransferase, the enzyme responsible for the expression of alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid. Both the cell surface membrane and the thyroglobulin secreted by cells grown in the presence of this hormone exhibit a marked decrease in the level of alpha 2,6-bound sialic acid with little or no change in the number of alpha 2,3-sialic acid residues. An additional, and unexpected, sequel is the finding of a coordinated decrease in all of the core monosaccharide constituents of the secreted thyroglobulin. Both of the above phenomenological changes appear to be at some variance with previously described systems wherein thyrotropin was deemed to increase glycosylation. It is anticipated that further resolution of this apparent difference may provide a clearer definition for the role of the carbohydrate moiety in affecting the biological function of thyroglobulin."
https://openalex.org/W1534241867,"Diphtheria toxin (DT) can translocate across endosomal membranes in response to low pH. Buried hydrophobic domains localized in the 37-kDa toxin B chain become exposed in response to acidic conditions and are thought to participate in the membrane translocation process. The crystal structure of DT has revealed a structurally distinct translocation domain composed of nine alpha-helices with their interconnecting loops (Choe, S., Bennett, M., Fujii, G., Curmi, P., Kantardjieff, K., Collier, R., and Eisenberg, D. (1992) Nature 357, 216-222). Two of these alpha-helices, TH8 and TH9, are unusually apolar and constitute the central core of the translocation domain. It has been proposed that these domains and the highly charged interconnecting loop undergo a conformation change under acidic conditions producing a dagger-like structure capable of inserting into the membrane thus initiating the translocation process. Proline 345 occupies a strategic location at the end of the TH8 alpha-helix. Proline residues have the ability to undergo a cis-trans isomerization reaction and because of this have been proposed to play a role in the conformational change that is a prerequisite for toxin translocation. The role of the proline at position 345 in membrane translocation was investigated. Pro was mutagenized to Glu and to Gly using a two-step recombinant polymerase chain reaction procedure, and the mutant proteins were expressed in vitro. Glu, an alpha-helix former, and Gly, an alpha-helix breaker, were selected for mutagenesis to distinguish between a structural role for Pro as an alpha-helix breaker and alternative roles, perhaps involving cis-trans isomerization-related conformational changes. Replacing Pro at position 345 with Glu or Gly resulted in a 99% reduction in toxicity to Vero cells. The enzymatic and binding activity of the toxin were not altered by the mutations. Instead, the reduction in toxicity is due to decreased translocation ability, suggesting that the Pro at position 345 plays a specific role in toxin membrane translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1605749795,"A recombinant protein corresponding to the putative heme-binding domain of assimilatory NADH:nitrate reductase from Chlorella vulgaris has been expressed and purified from transformed Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The recombinant protein, exhibited a subunit molecular mass of approximately 10 kDa with a N-terminal sequence beginning with the residues PAGA in agreement with that predicted by cDNA analysis. The UV-visible spectrum of the protein confirmed the incorporation of heme with maxima at 413 nm and 423, 528, and 557 nm for the oxidized and reduced forms, respectively. Circular dichroism spectra indicated the environment of the heme chromophore was very similar to that of the native enzyme. Potentiometric titrations of the recombinant heme domain yielded a midpoint potential of +16 mV (n = 1, pH 7), substantially higher than the values of -160 mV obtained for the native enzyme and -28 mV obtained for a previously expressed recombinant heme domain that contained part of the Mo-pterin domain. These results indicate that portions of the amino acid sequence that are involved in the formation of the Mo-pterin domain of Chlorella nitrate reductase influence the redox potential of the heme prosthetic group."
https://openalex.org/W1533214975,"An activity present in nuclear extracts of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae binds specifically to oligonucleotides containing DNA mismatches, as judged by a band shift assay. The specificity of this activity for mismatched DNA was confirmed by competition experiments; binding to radiolabeled heteroduplexes was abolished in the presence of excess unlabeled heteroduplex but not when excess unlabeled homoduplex was added. Both T/G and T/- (single base deletion) mispairs were recognized in each of two sequence contexts. Binding was also observed with G/G, G/A, A/C, and T/C mismatches, but recognition of a C/C mispair was very weak. Competition studies with the various mismatches were consistent with the idea that a single activity recognizes all mispairs tested. Extracts from strains mutant in either or both of two putative mismatch recognition functions, MSH2 and MSH3, were also tested. Mismatch-binding activity was present in extracts of msh3- strains but completely absent in msh2- strains. The molecular weight of the major binding protein was estimated by UV cross-linking experiments to be approximately 110 kDa, in good agreement with the size predicted for Msh2 protein (Reenan, R. A. and Kolodner, R. D. (1992) Genetics 132, 963-973)."
https://openalex.org/W1562072463,"I have investigated the effects of human urinary neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) (Chatterjee, S., and Ghosh, N. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 12554-12561) on the cell-surface binding, internalization, and degradation of 125I-low density lipoprotein (LDL) and on cholesteryl ester synthesis in cultured human fibroblasts. N-SMase exerted a concentration-dependent continuous stimulation of 125I-LDL cell-surface binding, internalization, and degradation in normal human fibroblasts. A 3-fold increase in binding, internalization, and degradation was observed at the maximum amount (600 units of N-SMase/ml) examined. This phenomenon was accompanied by a continuous stimulation of cholesteryl ester synthesis. A 5-fold increase in cholesteryl ester synthesis was observed after incubation for 4 h with N-SMase. Antibody against N-SMase and heat inactivation of N-SMase compromised the stimulatory effects of N-SMase on 125I-LDL metabolism and cholesteryl ester synthesis in these cells. Incubation of cells with phospholipase D and phospholipase C did not alter 125I-LDL binding, internalization, or degradation. This finding suggests that the stimulatory effects of N-SMase on LDL metabolism and on cholesteryl ester synthesis in fibroblasts is specific. Moreover, unlabeled LDL competitively displaced 125I-LDL from binding to N-SMase-treated cells. None of the precursors of sphingomyelin could mimic the stimulatory effects of N-SMase on 125I-LDL metabolism in these cells. Taken together, these studies suggest that one of the biological roles of N-SMase involves modulating LDL metabolism and cholesterol metabolism in fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1562247568,"Replication of plasmid RK2 in a variety of Gram-negative bacteria requires its origin of replication and the plasmid-encoded TrfA proteins (TrfA-33 and TrfA-44). The initiation of replication requires that the TrfA proteins bind to a series of 17-base pair (bp) direct repeats located within the RK2 origin. The conserved 17-bp repeats are arranged in tandem and are separated by less conserved spacer sequences of 4-6 bp in length. A series of plasmids containing one or two iterons, with or without the less conserved spacer sequences, were constructed to analyze the DNA sequence requirements for binding of TrfA-33 to the iterons. In addition to the analysis of TrfA binding in vitro, the plasmid constructs were examined for their ability to exert incompatibility toward an RK2 replicon in Escherichia coli. These analyses revealed that the conserved 17-bp iteron sequence itself is not sufficient for TrfA binding; the adjacent less conserved spacer sequences are also required. Site-specific mutagenesis was carried out to determine the importance of specific bases within the spacer sequence for binding activity and a consensus sequence for a TrfA-specific binding unit was determined. DNase I and methylation interference footprinting procedures were also carried out to characterize the TrfA-binding unit complex. Finally, it was shown that the binding of the TrfA-33 protein to two adjacent TrfA binding units on a DNA fragment is not substantially affected by the relative orientation or spacing between the two units."

The rates of hydrolysis of (ADP-ribose)n bound to various proteins by the purified nuclear glycohydrolase were higher than those of the corresponding free polymers. Kinetic analyses revealed that the enzyme had more activity toward poly(ADP-ribose) bound to histone H1 or to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase than toward oligo(ADP-ribose) bound to cytoplasmic proteins from mitochondria or mRNA ribonucleoprotein although the Km and Vmax values were dependent on the chain length (n). In contrast, cytoplasmic glycohydrolase purified from human erythrocytes was more active toward oligo(ADP-ribose) (n = 2.6 or 4.2) bound to the cytoplasmic proteins than to poly(ADP-ribose) (n = 14.6) bound to histone H1, and their kinetic parameters of glycohydrolase II were rather dependent on the acceptor molecules for (ADP-ribose)n. These results suggest that poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase I may play an important role in regulation of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation levels on chromosomal proteins in nuclei."

CHO cell and native placental PLP-A showed similar immunoreactive characteristics and electrophoretic mobilities. N-terminal sequencing verified the identity and purity of the recombinant PLP-A species and the site of cleavage of the signal peptide from the mature secreted PLP-A species. Recombinant PLP-A lacked activity in standardized prolactin and growth hormone in vitro bioassays. Antibodies generated to recombinant PLP-A facilitated the cellular localization of PLP-A and the identification of high molecular weight PLP-A complexes. Cross-linking analyses of radioiodinated PLP-A with serum harvested from late gestation rats indicated the presence of two major cross-linked complexes migrating under reducing conditions at 130 and 250 kDa and two minor cross-linked complexes migrating at 70 and 110 kDa. Binding of PLP-A to serum proteins was specific for PLP-A and not effectively competed by other members of the prolactin/growth hormone family. The PLP-A binding species were also found in serum from non-pregnant female and male rats."
https://openalex.org/W1595674107,"The V(D)J recombination reaction is directed by a pair of signal sequences, each consisting of a palindromic heptamer, an A/T-rich nonamer, and an intervening spacer sequence of 12 or 23 base pairs. The spacer sequence previously has not been analyzed for a functional role. In this study, numerous simultaneous sequence changes have been made in the spacer of each signal to test their functional importance. All of the AT base pairs in each signal were changed to GC base pairs. This particular change is of interest because it markedly increases the energy that would be required to melt out the two strands of each signal to permit the intersignal base pairing proposed in a commonly invoked model for signal-signal interaction in V(D)J recombination. We find that changing 6 to 12 AT base pairs in the 12-signal to GC does not affect V(D)J recombination, nor does changing 11 of 23 AT base pairs in the 23-signal. Substrates with all-GC spacer sequences in both the 12- and the 23-signal also recombine at efficiencies that are not significantly reduced. These studies demonstrate that the sequences at these particular positions are not recognized by the recombinase. In addition, the data do not support models invoking signal-signal base pairing."
https://openalex.org/W1607892485,"Primary deuterium (NADPH(D)), solvent deuterium, and multiple isotope effects and the pH dependence of kinetic parameters have been used to probe the mechanism of the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase from pig liver. Isotope effect and pH-rate data suggest a rate-determining reductive half-reaction in which reduction of the flavin by NADPH has only a minor rate limitation (DV approximately D(V/KNADPH) approximately 1.1), while protonation of the flavin at N-1 occurring in a step following reduction is slow (D2OV = 3, while D2O(V/KNADPH) = 2). An enzymatic general acid with a pK of 8.2 is required to protonate N-1 of the flavin. In the second half-reaction, uracil is reduced at C-6 by flavin and protonated on the opposite face at C-5 by an enzymatic general acid with a pK of 9. The hydride transfer from N-5 of the flavin to C-5 of uracil is facilitated by an enzymatic general base with a pK of 5.6 that accepts a proton from N-1 of the flavin. There is also evidence from the pH dependence of V and the V/K for reduced dinucleotide substrates that a second enzyme residue with a pK of 6.4 must be unprotonated for optimum activity, but is not essential for activity. None of the functional groups reflected in the V/KNADPH pH-rate profile have a role in binding, while both of those observed in the V/Kuracil profile have a role in binding as shown by the pH dependence of the dissociation constants for the competitive inhibitors ATP-ribose and 2,6-dihydroxypyridine."
https://openalex.org/W1519809853,"Derivatives of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SUP4 tRNATyr gene with binding sites for the transcription regulatory protein GCN4 located upstream of the transcriptional start site have been constructed. The effect of GCN4 on transcription of these genes by purified RNA polymerase III and transcription factors (TF) IIIB and IIIC has been analyzed. GCN4 effectively blocks initiation of transcription only when prebound to sites that overlap with the binding site of TFIIIB. Residual GCN4-repressed transcription is significantly redirected to nearby downstream sites, the selection of which depends on the location of bound GCN4. That prebound repressing GCN4 redirects, instead of merely blocking, the TFIIIC-dependent interaction of TFIIIB with DNA has been directly demonstrated by footprinting. The effect of GCN4 on transcription persists after it has been stripped off its DNA-binding site: once it has been redirected, DNA-bound TFIIIB remains in place, a consequence of the fact that it binds extraordinarily tightly to DNA without recognizing specific DNA sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1583587382,"Abstract Heparin cofactor II and antithrombin are plasma serine proteinase inhibitors whose ability to inhibit alpha-thrombin is accelerated by glycosaminoglycans. Dysfunctional thrombin mutants Quick I (Arg67-->Cys) and Quick II (Gly226-->Val) were used to further compare heparin cofactor II and antithrombin interactions. Quick I, Quick II, and alpha-thrombin were eluted at the same salt concentration from heparin-Sepharose suggesting that the putative heparin-binding site (also termed anion binding exosite-II) is functional. Antithrombin yielded similar inhibition rates for Quick I and alpha-thrombin in the absence or presence of various amounts of heparin. Also, Quick I was inhibited similarly to alpha-thrombin by heparin cofactor II in the absence of glycosaminoglycan. In contrast, glycosaminoglycan-accelerated Quick I inhibition by heparin cofactor II was greatly reduced indicating that anion binding exosite-I (where the mutation occurs in Quick I) is critical for increased inhibition by heparin cofactor II. We also found that heparin cofactor II formed a SDS-resistant bimolecular complex with Quick II and alpha-thrombin at similar rates and the rate of complex formation was accelerated in the presence of glycosaminoglycans. A three-dimensional molecular model of the Quick II active site compared to alpha-thrombin suggested that the heparin cofactor II Leu-Ser-reactive site sequence (P1-P1') is a compatible pseudosubstrate in contrast to the Arg-Ser sequence found in antithrombin. The importance of heparin cofactor II as a thrombin regulator will depend upon its ability to interact with glycosaminoglycans and the functional availability of thrombin exosites."
https://openalex.org/W1554437811,"Abstract Ca2+ plays essential roles as a second messenger often in synergism with the calcium- and phospholipid-dependent phorbol ester receptor, protein kinase C (PKC), which stimulates Ca2+ influx in various cell types in a potential positive feedback mechanism. To address the compatibility of these mechanisms between lower eukaryotes and mammals, we have stably expressed bovine PKC alpha in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that phorbol ester binding sites are created which stimulate a specific calcium- and phospholipid-dependent catalytic activity in vitro. Phorbol ester activation in vivo stimulates PKC down-regulation, uptake of extracellular Ca2+, Ca2+ dependence of cell viability, and changes in cell morphology. This may represent activation of a putative PKC-mediated signaling pathway utilized by functional yeast homologs of mammalian PKC isoforms. These are suggested by some protein data; however, their genes have not yet been characterized (Simon, A. J., Milner, Y., Saville, S. P., Dvir, A., Mochly-Rosen, D., and Orr, E. (1991) Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 243, 165-171). Our findings indicate that bovine PKC alpha is functional in yeast and stimulates calcium uptake in a manner similar to some of its responses in mammalian cells, which suggests compatible aspects of higher and lower eukaryotic signaling pathways and the feasibility of dissecting parts of the action of common signaling mediators in a simple genetic model."
https://openalex.org/W1583018886,"Abstract Polypeptides comprising 20 amino acid residues (Y2) were covalently bound to the carboxyl terminus of a truncated proOmpA (proOmpA-D72C) through N,N'-bis(3-maleimidopropionyl)-2-hydroxy-1,3-propanediamine (X). The length of the inverted linker domain was 2.8 nm. proOmpA-D72C-X-Y2 thus synthesized was subjected to in vitro translocation into everted membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli. The conjugated protein was translocation-competent in terms of both proteinase K resistance and signal peptide cleavage, when a proton motive force (delta microH+) was imposed. The translocation was ATP-dependent. The proteinase K-treatment resulted in the digestion of SecA, SecE, and SecY in the membrane, suggesting that the proteinase K resistance of the Y2 domain was not due to its interaction with these Sec proteins in the secretory machinery. In the absence of delta microH+, the translocation ceased at the linker domain. Upon the imposition of delta microH+, the linker-Y2 domain underwent translocation, which did not require ATP hydrolysis as in the case of the translocation of the latter portion of usual secretory proteins. The translocation was prevented by anti-Y2 IgG even when delta microH+ was imposed. Another conjugated protein, which possesses a polypeptide comprising 61 amino acid residues after the linker (proOmpA-D72C-X-Lpp'), was synthesized. This compound was also translocated into everted membrane vesicles with cleavage of the signal peptide. These results suggest that substances to be translocated through the secretory machinery need not necessarily be solely held together by polypeptide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1570341656,"Abstract Lipooligosaccharides (LOSs) have recently been proposed as markers of mycobacterial avirulence. They have been characterized in Mycobacterium kansasii cell wall and were investigated in Mycobacterium gastri since the distinction between the two mycobacterial species remains in some question. A set of unknown LOSs was isolated from M. gastri W471. The highly antigenic lipooligosaccharide, LOS-III, was purified and appeared in all the M. gastri strains investigated regardless of their morphology. Moreover, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and chromatographic approaches, it was found that LOS-III unambiguously distinguished M. gastri from the opportunistic pathogen M. kansasii. The LOS-III structure was established from its native form using NMR spectroscopy. This strategy revealed the presence of a supplementary monosaccharide (X) which was not characterized by routine carbohydrate analysis. Its core structure, 3,6-dideoxy-alpha-hexopyranose, was established from the complete assignment of the 1H and 13C spectra by two-dimensional homonuclear (COSY, HOHAHA) and heteronuclear 1H-13C heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation spectroscopy (HMQC) and HMQC-HOHAHA spectroscopy. Due to the absence of a proton at C4, the key data of the C4 side chain structure came from the heteronuclear multiple bond correlation spectroscopy (HMBC) spectrum. It was revealed to be a C-alkyl chain of partial structure 1,3-dimethoxypropyl. From the HMBC spectrum, this novel C-branched monosaccharide was located at the nonreducing end of the LOS, while the putative reducing end was found to consist of a 2',4,6-triacylated alpha-alpha-trehalose. The following structure, based on the evidence presented in this paper, is proposed for LOS-III: Xp alpha(1-->3)[L-Xylp beta(1-->4)](6)3-O-Me-Rhap alpha(1-->3)D- Galp beta(1-->3)-D-Glcp beta(1-->4)2-O-acyl-D-Glcp-alpha(1 1)alpha 4,6-di-O- acyl-D-Glcp."
