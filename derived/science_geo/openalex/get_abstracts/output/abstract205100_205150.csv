https://openalex.org/W2091522422,"The lateral geniculate nucleus is organized in such a way that, initially at least, information from the one eye is almost exclusively segregated from that from the other eye. Single-unit recording, however, confirms the histological evidence that bilateral integration does take place. A small number of cells (< 8.5 percent) receive afferents directly from both optic nerves and are discharged by stimulating either nerve (direct interaction). More common is delayed interaction, where the cells are discharged independently by either optic nerve but only after a relatively long latency. Indirect interaction effects also occur."

https://openalex.org/W2030146009,"THE enlargement of the embryonic chick spleen which accompanies chorio-allantoic grafting of adult chicken spleen was first described by Murphy1 in 1916. This phenomenon attracted the attention of a number of workers who believed that the splenomegaly was brought about by a proliferation of embryonic cells in response to some stimulus provided by the implanted spleen2,3. Simonsen4 in 1957 showed that the splenic enlargement also occurred following the intravenous injection into the embryo of adult chicken blood or spleen cells. He showed that most embryos injected with homologous adult blood died of hæmolytic anæmia and the results of Coombs' tests strongly suggested that antibodies against the host red blood cells were present. He came to the conclusion from the results of his experiments that proliferating donor cells were responsible for the antibody production and the splenic enlargement."

https://openalex.org/W2074603561,"ABORTION of infectious origin in sheep, has been attributed to many organisms. Of the bacterial agents Salmonella abortus ovis and Vibrio fetus appear to be the most common ; of less frequent occurrence are other members of the Salmonella and members of the Brucella, Listerella, Leptospira, Bacteroides and Corynebacterium groups. A virus of the Psittacosis-Lymphogranuloma group has been associated with a large number of flock outbreaks of abortion in Great Britain1 and, more recently, in Germany, France, Hungary and the United States."
https://openalex.org/W2067863710,"MOST studies on lipoxidase have been carried out on material from soya extracts. Lipoxidase catalyses the oxidation of pentadiene fatty acids such as linoleic acid, forming conjugated diene hydroperoxides. Hæmatin compounds such as hæmoglobin, catalase and cytochrome c also catalyse the oxidation of these fatty acids. A recent study of this type of hæmatin action has been made by Maier and Tappel1. (For convenience we use the term ‘hæmatins’ for ironporphyrin compounds irrespective of iron valency.)"

https://openalex.org/W1996462100,"HIGHLY purified preparations of the immobilization antigens of Paramecium aurelia, about which extensive genetic studies have been described previously1, are now known to consist largely of protein (ref. 2 and unpublished work by J. O. B.). With the aim of obtaining information on genetically controlled protein variations, we have made a preliminary study of the physicochemical properties of some of these antigens, using various stocks of P. aurelia (variety 1). The antigens studied are denoted 60D, 90D, 103D, 33D, 60G, 60T. Formation of the first four is governed by a series of alleles denoted D 60, D 90, etc., and of the fifth by a non-allelic gene G 60 in conjunction with a different cytoplasmic state. The type 60T is produced in conjunction with a third cytoplasmic state; but the genic basis of this type has not been investigated."

Recent literature assumes the chicken to have a blood-clotting time in a range similar to the higher mammals. Dukes1 quotes Amendt (1922) as finding this to be 4.5 min. ; Johnson and Connor2 found an average of 6 min. 21 sec. with a range of 1–14 min. ; while Didisheim et al. 3 query their recorded time of 9 min. in glass and 10 min. with siliconized equipment at 37° C. Howell4, however, in 1909 infers that it is common knowledge that the blood of birds, terrapins and horses clots slowly. In 19405 he indicates that prolonged clotting time of hours or days in lower vertebrates (birds, reptiles and fishes) is due to the lack of “thromboplastic substance” within the vessels while prompt clotting is brought about by an active “thromboplastic tissue extract”."

These discoveries have directed attention to the lack of information concerning the metabolism of selenium in subtoxic amounts. The present communication gives results for whole-body turnover, or total excretion, of selenium by the rat over a prolonged period of time."

https://openalex.org/W2066033894,Ultraviolet irradiation of kidney-bean leaves results in the disappearance of chloroplasts from guard cells. The evidence indicates that ultraviolet irradiation causes plastid breakdown indirectly through an effect on guard-cell metabolism.
https://openalex.org/W2365487553,"CERTAIN plants, chiefly their seeds, contain agglutinins for the erythrocytes of various species. Whereas most plant agglutinins make no individual distinctions among human erythrocytes, some act selectively on one or other of the following blood-group antigens1: A, A1, B, H and N. Except for separable anti-H and anti-B agglutinins from the seed capsule of certain species of Euonymus, of the family Celastraceae, all specific seed agglutinins have hitherto been obtained from Leguminosae1."

https://openalex.org/W2033673236,"IT has been found by Schayer and his co-workers that adrenalectomy induces an increase in the rate of histamine formation in some tissues of the rat1,2. This increase may be the cause of the increased tissue histamine content3–5. Hicks and West pointed out that the tissue histamine content in adrenalectomized rats could be kept at a normal level by giving 0.9 per cent sodium chloride as drinking fluid6. A similar effect was observed by Rose and Browne3. During experiments on the effect of the adrenocortical hormones on the urinary excretion of histamine in normal and pregnant rats we made an observation which is of interest in this connexion."

https://openalex.org/W2074637052,"THE incorporation of labelled precursors into amphibian embryos is limited by the presence of a coat which covers the embryo and which renders the embryo impermeable to a large number of substances. One of them is uridine. However, we found that embryonic cells the coat of which has been disintegrated by placing them in a medium totally devoided of calcium incorporate tritiated uridine very rapidly, while the control embryos do not. Using this procedure, we have been able to follow the incorporation of this substance into dissociated embryonic cells at different stages of development."

https://openalex.org/W1998594328,"MOST mammalian cell cultures require serum protein for continued survival and growth. Serum protein is probably the most expensive component of tissue and cell culture media, especially if human cells are cultivated in homologous serum. We have studied the possibility of employing outdated blood bank blood as a possible source of the protein necessary for the growth of HeLa cells. Such discarded blood is available in fairly large quantities and if it could be successfully employed for cell cultures an expensive bleeding programme could be dispensed with."
