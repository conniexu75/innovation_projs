https://openalex.org/W4295136939,"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) 5-HT2-family receptors represent essential targets for lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and all other psychedelic drugs. Although the primary psychedelic drug effects are mediated by the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor (HTR2A), the 5-HT2B serotonin receptor (HTR2B) has been used as a model receptor to study the activation mechanisms of psychedelic drugs due to its high expression and similarity to HTR2A. In this study, we determined the cryo-EM structures of LSD-bound HTR2B in the transducer-free, Gq-protein-coupled, and β-arrestin-1-coupled states. These structures provide distinct signaling snapshots of LSD's action, ranging from the transducer-free, partially active state to the transducer-coupled, fully active states. Insights from this study will both provide comprehensive molecular insights into the signaling mechanisms of the prototypical psychedelic LSD and accelerate the discovery of novel psychedelic drugs."

We used Facebook Prophet to generate forecasting models based on the monthly numbers of suicide deaths in Korea between 1997 and 2018, validated the models by comparison with the 2019 numbers, and predicted the numbers of suicides in 2020. We compared the expected and observed numbers of suicides during the COVID-19 pandemic. The total numbers of suicides during the COVID-19 pandemic did not deviate from projections based on the pre-pandemic period. However, the number of suicides among women and those under the age of 34 years significantly exceeded the expected level. The COVID-19 pandemic did not increase the overall suicide rate significantly. However, suicides among women and young people increased, suggesting that the pandemic might drive more members of these groups to suicide. Further studies are needed to verify the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide."

The identification of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) hydrolase SARM1 as a central metabolic sensor and axon executioner presents an exciting opportunity to develop novel neuroprotective therapies that can prevent or halt the degenerative process, yet limited progress has been made on advancing efficacious inhibitors. We describe a class of NAD-dependent active-site SARM1 inhibitors that function by intercepting NAD hydrolysis and undergoing covalent conjugation with the reaction product adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPR). The resulting small-molecule ADPR adducts are highly potent and confer compelling neuroprotection in preclinical models of neurological injury and disease, validating this mode of inhibition as a viable therapeutic strategy. Additionally, we show that the most potent inhibitor of CD38, a related NAD hydrolase, also functions by the same mechanism, further underscoring the broader applicability of this mechanism in developing therapies against this class of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W4295241419,"Abrupt aggregation of misfolded proteins is a hallmark of the large group of amyloid pathologies that include diabetes type 2, Alzheimer and Parkinson's diseases. Protein aggregation yields oligomers and fibrils, β-sheet-rich structures that exert cell toxicity. Microscopic examination of amyloid deposits reveals the presence of lipids membranes, which suggests that lipids can be involved in the process of pathogenic protein assembly. In this study, we show that lipids can uniquely alter the aggregation rates of lysozyme, a protein that is associated with systemic amyloidosis. Specifically, cardiolipin (CL), ceramide (CER), and sphingomyelin (SM) accelerate, phosphatidylcholine (PC) strongly inhibits, whereas phosphatidylserine (PS) has no effect on the rate of protein aggregation. Furthermore, lipids uniquely alter the secondary structure of lysozyme aggregates. Furthermore, we found that lysozyme aggregates grown in the presence of CL, CER, SM, PS, and CL:PC mixtures exert significantly lower production of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysfunction compared to lysozyme:PC aggregates and lysozyme fibrils grown in the lipid-free environment. These findings suggest that a change in the lipid composition of cell membranes, which is taken place upon neurodegeneration, may trigger the formation of toxic protein species that otherwise would not be formed."
https://openalex.org/W4295137065,"Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) adaptively regulates synaptic transmission in health and disease. Despite identification of numerous genes that are essential for PHP, we lack a dynamic framework to explain how PHP is initiated, potentiated, and limited to achieve precise control of vesicle fusion. Here, utilizing both mice and Drosophila, we demonstrate that PHP progresses through the assembly and physical expansion of presynaptic signaling foci where activated integrins biochemically converge with trans-synaptic Semaphorin2b/PlexinB signaling. Each component of the identified signaling complexes, including alpha/beta-integrin, Semaphorin2b, PlexinB, talin, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and their biochemical interactions, are essential for PHP. Complex integrity requires the Sema2b ligand and complex expansion includes a ∼2.5-fold expansion of active-zone associated puncta composed of the actin-binding protein talin. Finally, complex pre-expansion is sufficient to accelerate the rate and extent of PHP. A working model is proposed incorporating signal convergence with dynamic molecular assemblies that instruct PHP."
https://openalex.org/W4295520262,"This paper empirically investigates the relationship between tourism and economic growth by using a panel data cointegration test, Granger causality test and Wavelet coherence analysis at the global level. This analysis examines 105 nations utilising panel data from 2003 to 2020. The findings indicates that in most regions, tourism contributes significantly to economic growth and vice versa. Developing trade across most of the regions appears to be a major influencer in the study, as a bidirectional association exists between trade openness and economic growth. Additionally, all regions other than the American region showed a one-way association between gross capital formation and economic growth. Therefore, it is crucial to highlight that using initiatives to increase demand would advance tourism while also boosting the economy."
https://openalex.org/W4295136813,"Mechanical nociception is essential for animal survival. However, the forces involved in nociceptor activation and the underlying mechanotransduction mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we address these problems by investigating nocifensive behavior in Drosophila larvae. We show that strong poking stimulates nociceptors with a mixture of forces including shear stress and stretch. Unexpectedly, nociceptors are selectively activated by shear stress, but not stretch. Both the shear stress responses of nociceptors and nocifensive behavior require transient receptor potential A1 (TrpA1), which is specifically expressed in nociceptors. We further demonstrate that expression of mammalian or Drosophila TrpA1 in heterologous cells confers responses to shear stress but not stretch. Finally, shear stress activates TrpA1 in a membrane-delimited manner, through modulation of membrane fluidity. Together, our study reveals TrpA1 as an evolutionarily conserved mechanosensitive channel specifically activated by shear stress and suggests a critical role of shear stress in activating nociceptors to drive mechanical nociception."
https://openalex.org/W4295468518,"In this study, we used network pharmacology to explore the possible therapeutic mechanism underlying the treatment of diabetic nephropathy with Yishen capsules.The active chemical constituents of Yishen capsules were acquired using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology platform and the Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Component target proteins were then searched and screened in the BATMAN database. Target proteins were cross-validated using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses of the target proteins were performed. Then, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was performed using the STRING database. Finally, a pharmacological network was constructed to show the component-target-pathway relationships. Molecular docking was used to analyse the interaction between drug components and target proteins.In total, 285 active chemical components were found, including 85 intersection targets against DN. In the pharmacological network, 5 key herbs (A. membranaceus, A. sinensis, E. ferox, A. orientale, and R. rosea) and their corresponding 12 key components (beta-sitosterol, beta-carotene, stigmasterol, alisol B, mairin, quercetin, caffeic acid, 1-monolinolein, kaempferol, jaranol, formononetin, and calycosin) were screened. Furthermore, the 12 key components were related to 24 target protein nodes (e.g., AGT, AKT1, AKT2, BCL2, NFKB1, and SIRT1) and enriched in 24 pathway nodes (such as the NF-kappa B, AGE-RAGE, toll-like receptor, and relaxin signaling pathways). Molecular docking revealed that hydrogen bond was formed between drug components and target proteins.In conclusion, the active constituents of Yishen capsules modulate targets or signaling pathways in DN pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4295510654,"Breast cancer has different epidemio-clinical characteristics in Middle East and North-African populations compared to those reported in the Western countries. The aim of this study is to analyze the epidemiological and clinico-pathological features of breast cancer in Tunisia and to determine prognostic factors with special interest to family history, Ki-67 proliferation index and comorbidity. We retrospectively reviewed epidemiological and clinico-pathological data from patients' medical records, treated in the Medical Oncology Department at Abderrahmane Mami Hospital, in the period 2011-2015. Data has been collected on 602 breast cancer patients and analyzed using SPSS software V.23.0. Our study showed high fractions of young breast cancer patients and cases with dense breasts. The most prevalent comorbidities observed in the studied cohort were cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Familial breast cancer was found in 23.3% of cases and was associated with younger age at diagnosis (p<0.001) and advanced stage (p = 0.015). Ki-67 index >20% was significantly associated with early age at diagnosis, lymph node involvement (p = 0.002), advanced tumor grade (p<0.001) and high risk of relapse (p = 0.007). Ki-67 cut-off 30% predicted survival in luminal cases. Survival was worse in patients with triple negative breast cancer compared to non-triple negative breast cancer, inflammatory breast cancer compared to non-inflammatory breast cancer, moderately to poorly differentiated tumors compared to well-differentiated tumors and with positive lymph nodes compared to pN0 (p<0.05). Our study showed new insights into epidemiological and clinico-pathological characteristics of breast cancer that are not well explored in Tunisian population. Considering our findings along with the implementation of electronic health record system may improve patient health care quality and disease management."
https://openalex.org/W4295009333,"Protein S-acylation is a reversible post-translational modification that modulates the localization and function of many cellular proteins. S-acylation is mediated by a family of zinc finger DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) domain-containing (zDHHC) proteins encoded by 23 distinct ZDHHC genes in the human genome. These enzymes catalyze S-acylation in a two-step process involving ""autoacylation"" of the cysteine residue in the catalytic DHHC motif followed by transfer of the acyl chain to a substrate cysteine. S-acylation is essential for many fundamental physiological processes, and there is growing interest in zDHHC enzymes as novel drug targets for a range of disorders. However, there is currently a lack of chemical modulators of S-acylation either for use as tool compounds or for potential development for therapeutic purposes. Here, we developed and implemented a novel FRET-based high-throughput assay for the discovery of compounds that interfere with autoacylation of zDHHC2, an enzyme that is implicated in neuronal S-acylation pathways. Our screen of >350,000 compounds identified two related tetrazole-containing compounds (TTZ-1 and TTZ-2) that inhibited both zDHHC2 autoacylation and substrate S-acylation in cell-free systems. These compounds were also active in human embryonic kidney 293T cells, where they inhibited the S-acylation of two substrates (SNAP25 and PSD95 [postsynaptic density protein 95]) mediated by different zDHHC enzymes, with some apparent isoform selectivity. Furthermore, we confirmed activity of the hit compounds through resynthesis, which provided sufficient quantities of material for further investigations. The assays developed provide novel strategies to screen for zDHHC inhibitors, and the identified compounds add to the chemical toolbox for interrogating cellular activities of zDHHC enzymes in S-acylation."

https://openalex.org/W4295136987,"The integration of feedforward (sensory) and feedback (top-down) neuronal signals is a principal function of the neocortex. Yet, we have limited insight into how these information streams are combined by individual neurons. Using a two-color optogenetic strategy, we found that layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the posterior parietal cortex receive monosynaptic dual innervation, combining sensory inputs with top-down signals. Subclasses of layer 5 pyramidal neurons integrated these synapses with distinct temporal dynamics. Specifically, regular spiking cells exhibited supralinear enhancement of delayed—but not coincident—inputs, while intrinsic burst-firing neurons selectively boosted coincident synaptic events. These subthreshold integration characteristics translated to a nonlinear summation of action potential firing. Complementing electrophysiology with computational modeling, we found that distinct integration profiles arose from a cell-type-specific interaction of ionic mechanisms and feedforward inhibition. These data provide insight into the cellular properties that guide the nonlinear interaction of distinct long-range afferents in the neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W4297200615,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging flavivirus that causes conditions such as microcephaly and testis damage. The spread of ZIKV has become a major public health concern. Recent studies indicated that antimicrobial peptides are an ideal source for screening antiviral candidates with broad-spectrum antiviral activities, including against ZIKV. We herein found that Hc-CATH, a cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide identified from the sea snake Hydrophis cyanocinctus in our previous work, conferred protection against ZIKV infection in host cells and showed preventative efficacy and therapeutic efficacy in C57BL/6J mice, Ifnar1−/− mice, and pregnant mice. Intriguingly, we revealed that Hc-CATH decreased the susceptibility of host cells to ZIKV by downregulating expression of AXL, a TAM (TYRO3, AXL and MERTK) family kinase receptor that mediates ZIKV infection, and subsequently reversed the negative regulation of AXL on host’s type I interferon response. Furthermore, we showed that the cyclo-oxygenase-2/prostaglandin E2/adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A pathway was involved in Hc-CATH-mediated AXL downregulation, and Hc-CATH in addition directly inactivated ZIKV particles by disrupting viral membrane. Finally, while we found Hc-CATH did not act on the late stage of ZIKV infection, structure–function relationship studies revealed that α-helix and phenylalanine residues are key structural requirements for its protective efficacy against initial ZIKV infection. In summary, we demonstrate that Hc-CATH provides prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against ZIKV infection via downregulation of AXL, as well as inactivating the virion. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of cathelicidin against viral infection and highlight the potential of Hc-CATH to prevent and treat ZIKV infection.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a single-stranded, enveloped, and positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family (1Sirohi D. Kuhn R.J. Zika virus structure, maturation, and receptors.J. Infect. Dis. 2017; 216: S935-S944Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This group of approximately 70 viruses include members such as dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus (2Miner J.J.

In all flaviviruses, the RNA genome encodes a polyprotein that is processed into three structural proteins (core C, membrane precursor prM, and envelope E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (1Sirohi D.

Molecular biology of flaviviruses.Adv. Virus Res. 2003; 59: 23-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The structural proteins form the virus particle and the nonstructural proteins assist in replication and packaging of the genome. Aedes mosquitoes are the main vectors for the transmission of ZIKV (5Li M.I. Wong P.S. Ng L.C. Tan C.H. Oral susceptibility of Singapore Aedes (stegomyia) aegypti (linnaeus) to Zika virus.Plos Negl. Trop. Dis. 2012; 6e1792Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Besides, ZIKV can also be transmitted through sexual, vertical, and blood transmission (6Deckard D.T. Chung W.M. Brooks J.T. Smith J.C. Woldai S.

Recent epidemiological studies have shown that ZIKV infection can cause a variety of serious diseases, which can lead to microcephaly, congenital malformations, brain calcification, fetal death, multiple organ failure, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, testis damage, and male infertility (9Swaminathan S.

In addition, ZIKV infection can also cause blindness and a variety of eye abnormalities, including retinal spots, lens subluxation, and optic neuritis (2Miner J.J. Diamond M.S.

TAM receptors belong to the tyrosine receptor family, a transmembrane protein that transmits signals from the extracellular environment to the cytoplasm and nucleus. TAM receptors regulate various cellular functions, including clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages, platelet aggregation, and differentiation of natural killer cells (17Linger R.M. Keating A.K.

These molecules involved in viral infection are potential targets for the prevention and therapy of ZIKV infection.Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also called host defense peptides, are a group of relatively small cationic peptides. They are an important part of the innate immune system and play an important role in fighting against bacterial infection (26Wei L. Gao J. Zhang S. Wu S. Xie Z.

Recently, more and more studies have shown that AMPs can also exert antiviral effects by inhibiting virus adsorption, disrupting virus envelope, and regulating host antiviral immune response (27Barlow P.G.

Therefore, AMPs can be used as new candidates for the development of antiviral drugs. In mammals, the two major AMP families are cathelicidins and defensins, among which cathelicidins have direct antimicrobial activity against a variety of microorganisms and actively participate in host’s immune regulation (35Zanetti M. Cathelicidins, multifunctional peptides of the innate immunity.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 75: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Cathelicidins are also found in the venom of various snakes. Previous studies have shown that cathelicidins derived from snakes have strong antibacterial activity with broad spectrum, including clinically isolated drug-resistant bacterial strains (36Wang Y.

Besides, snake-derived cathelicidins have extremely low cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity, showing a high clinical application prospect. In our previous study, we identified a novel cathelicidin peptide from the venom of the sea snake, Hydrophis cyanocinctus, which is designated as Hc-CATH (26Wei L. Gao J. Zhang S. Wu S. Xie Z. Ling G. et al.Identification and characterization of the first cathelicidin from sea snakes with potent antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity and special mechanism.J. Biol.

It showed a broad antibacterial spectrum as well as potent anti-inflammatory activity with high stability and low cytotoxicity (26Wei L. Gao J. Zhang S. Wu S. Xie Z.

In this study, we tried to evaluate the effects of Hc-CATH on ZIKV infection, including its effect on ZIKV-caused cytopathic effect, ZIKV replication in vitro, and ZIKV replication in vivo. The mechanism of action against ZIKV infection was also investigated.ResultsHc-CATH inhibits ZIKV infection in vitroIn order to explore whether Hc-CATH has antiviral activity against ZIKV, Vero cells were infected with ZIKV in the presence of Hc-CATH or PBS (solvent of peptide) as indicated in Fig. 1A, and the effect of Hc-CATH on ZIKV-caused cytopathic effect and ZIKV replication were detected. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, ZIKV infection obviously caused cytopathic effect in Vero cells, and Hc-CATH markedly reversed the cytopathic effect caused by ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner. Hc-CATH also reduced the intracellular ZIKV RNA (Fig. 1D), NS3 protein (Fig. 1E), E protein (Fig. 1F), and extracellular ZIKV particles (Fig. 1, G and H) in a dose-dependent manner. At concentration of 5 μM, Hc-CATH reduced about 70.3% cytopathic effect, 52.7% ZIKV RNA, 67.4% NS3 protein, and 71.6% ZIKV particles. Besides, Hc-CATH did not have cytotoxicity against mammalian cells at concentrations of 1.25, 2.5, and 5 μM (Fig. S1). The results indicate that Hc-CATH shows inhibitory effect against ZIKV infection in Vero cells.Hc-CATH decreases the susceptibility of host cells to ZIKVTo understand the anti-ZIKV mechanism of Hc-CATH, we first investigated whether Hc-CATH decreases the susceptibility of host cells. Vero cells were incubated with Hc-CATH or PBS before ZIKV infection as indicated in Fig. 2A (Hc-CATH-cell-pre). As shown in Fig. 2, B–G, the incubation of Vero cells with Hc-CATH for 2 h significantly reduced the intracellular ZIKV RNA (Fig. 2B), NS3 protein (Fig. 2, C and D), E protein (Fig. 2E), and extracellular ZIKV particles (Fig. 2, F and G) relative to PBS incubation. The incubation of Vero cells with Hc-CATH reduced about 46.1% ZIKV RNA (Figs. 2B), 50.1% ZIKV NS3 protein (Fig. 2, C and D), and 62.2% ZIKV particles (Fig. 2, F and G). The results indicate that incubation of Vero cells with Hc-CATH decreases the susceptibility of host cells to ZIKV.Figure 2Hc-CATH decreases the susceptibility of Vero cells to ZIKV. A, schematic diagram of B–G (Hc-CATH-Vero-pre). B–G, pretreatment with Hc-CATH before ZIKV infection decreases the susceptibility of Vero cells to ZIKV. Vero cells were seeded in 24-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) and cultured in DMEM containing 2% FBS. Hc-CATH (2.5 μM), AC5 (2.5 μM), LL-37 (2.5 μM), or same volume of PBS (peptide solvent) was added to cells and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Vero cells were washed three times with PBS, and ZIKV (MOI = 1) was added to cells. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, Vero cells were washed with PBS and transferred with fresh DMEM containing 2% FBS. After culture for 48 h, intracellular ZIKV RNA (B), NS3 protein (C and D, C: immunoblots, D: ratio analyzed by ImageJ), E protein (E, the scale bar represents 50 μm), and extracellular ZIKV titer (F and G) was tested by qPCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence staining, and plaque-forming assay, respectively.

Carnec X. Lecoin M.P. Ramdasi R. Guivel-Benhassine F.

In order to identify whether Hc-CATH decreases the susceptibility of host cells by downregulating these factors, we performed experiment as indicated in Fig. 3A. As shown in Fig. 3B, Hc-CATH reduced the level of AXL in Vero cells relative to PBS after incubation for 24 h. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining confirmed that Hc-CATH did reduce the level of AXL in Vero cells after incubation for 24 h (Fig. 3C). While Hc-CATH did not obviously influence the other ZIKV entry factors (TYRO3 and TIM-1) at 6, 12, and 24 h post Hc-CATH addition (Fig. 3B). We next tested the effect of Hc-CATH on AXL in Vero cells upon ZIKV infection as indicated in Fig. 3D. At 24 h post Hc-CATH addition, Hc-CATH also decreased the level of AXL in Vero cells relative to PBS upon ZIKV infection (Fig. 3E). We then tested the effect of Hc-CATH on AXL in A549 cells and U251 cells as indicated in Fig. 4A and Fig. 5A, respectively. The results demonstrated that Hc-CATH effectively decreased the level of AXL in A549 cells (Fig. 4, B and C, E and F) and U251 cells (Fig. 5, B and C, E and F). Besides, Hc-CATH also decreased the susceptibility of A549 cells (Fig. 4, E and G) and U251 cells (Fig. 5, E and G) to ZIKV. The data suggest that Hc-CATH decreases the susceptibility of host cells to ZIKV by downregulating AXL.Figure 3Hc-CATH downregulates AXL in Vero cell. A, schematic diagram of B and C.

We found that Hc-CATH did not influence the expression of COX-2 (Fig. 6A), but it significantly inhibited the enzyme activity of COX-2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). At concentration of 10 μM, the inhibitory rate of Hc-CATH against COX-2 activity could reach about 80%. As expected, the addition of Hc-CATH significantly reduced the synthesis of PGE2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6C). It was reported that PGE2 can lead to the activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and an increase in the cAMP. Subsequently, cAMP can activate PKA (39Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. Prostaglandin E receptors.J.

https://openalex.org/W4295196948,"The adhesion family of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) is defined by an N-terminal large extracellular region that contains various adhesion-related domains and a highly-conserved GPCR-autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, the latter of which is located immediately before a canonical seven-transmembrane domain. These receptors are expressed widely and involved in various functions including development, angiogenesis, synapse formation, and tumorigenesis. GPR125 (ADGRA3), an orphan adhesion GPCR, has been shown to modulate planar cell polarity in gastrulating zebrafish, but its biochemical properties and role in mammalian cells have remained largely unknown. Here, we show that human GPR125 likely undergoes cis-autoproteolysis when expressed in canine kidney epithelial MDCK cells and human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells. The cleavage appears to occur at an atypical GPCR proteolysis site within the GAIN domain during an early stage of receptor biosynthesis. The products, i.e., the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments, seem to remain associated after self-proteolysis, as observed in other adhesion GPCRs. Furthermore, in polarized MDCK cells, GPR125 is exclusively recruited to the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane. The recruitment likely requires the C-terminal PDZ-domain–binding motif of GPR125 and its interaction with the cell polarity protein Dlg1. Knockdown of GPR125 as well as that of Dlg1 results in formation of aberrant cysts with multiple lumens in Matrigel 3D culture of MDCK cells. Consistent with the multilumen phenotype, mitotic spindles are incorrectly oriented during cystogenesis in GPR125-KO MDCK cells.

Structurally, according to a topology-based tripartite compartmentation, aGPCRs consist of an N-terminal large extracellular region (ECR), a canonical 7TM helix bundle, and a C-terminal tail (CTT) (6Vizurraga A.

The large ECRs of aGPCRs contain a variety of adhesion-related domains that are often repeated and are linked to the 7TM domain via the highly conserved GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain. The GAIN domain constitutively self-cleaves the receptors into two fragments, namely an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF), contributing to a cleavage-based bipartite structure. The GPCR proteolysis site (GPS) locates near the C terminus of the GAIN domain; as a result, the NTF harbors all external protein domains and the larger part of the autolyzed GAIN domain, whereas the CTF contains a small part of the cleaved GAIN domain, the entire 7TM helix bundle, and the entire CTT. Because of a dense network of hydrogen bonds within the GAIN domain, the NTF and CTF remain normally associated after cis-autoproteolysis. Although research of aGPCR has been hampered by the orphan status of receptors, recent advancements have revealed a conserved method of aGPCR activation involving a tethered ligand within the GAIN domain (6Vizurraga A.

Soc. Trans. 2021; 49: 1695-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). NTF–CTF dissociation (for example, mechanically induced dissociation of the fragments) results in the exposed N-terminal peptide of the CTF, i.e., the tethered ligand, which interacts as an agonist intramolecularly with its orthosteric site in the 7TM domain. Thus, cis-autoproteolysis is a prerequisite for tethered peptide agonism for activation of aGPCR, implying that the capability of self-cleavage at least in part renders the receptor out of an orphan state. GPR125 (a.k.a. ADGRA3), an orphan aGPCR, has a leucine-rich repeat (LRR), an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, a hormone-binding domain (HBD), and a GAIN domain in the N-terminal ECR (Fig. 1A). In general, the GPS motif in the GAIN domain comprises the tripeptide His-Leu/Ile-Thr/Ser and is cleaved at the peptide bond between Leu/Ile and Thr/Ser. Because the corresponding sequence is Ser-Leu-Ser in GPR125, where the His at position –2 respective to the putative cleavage site is replaced by Ser, this receptor has been predicted noncleavable (6Vizurraga A.

The previous finding that the CTT of GPR125 is capable of binding to Discs Large 1 (Dlg1), a cell polarity protein (16Yamamoto Y. Irie K. Asada M. Mino A. Mandai K. Takai Y.

In the present study, we show that human GPR125, expressed in kidney epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and embryonic kidney HEK293 cells, undergoes cis-autoproteolysis at the atypical GPS during an early stage of receptor biosynthesis. The products NTF and CTF are recruited together to the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane in polarized MDCK cells, which recruitment requires its interaction with Dlg1. GPR125 is indispensable for correct cystogenesis and mitotic spindle orientation in 3D-cultured MDCK cells, indicating its crucial role in epithelial apicobasal polarization.

Direct binding of the human homologue of the Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor gene to seven-pass transmembrane proteins, tumor endothelial marker 5 (TEM5), and a novel TEM5-like protein.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3889-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Cazorla-Vázquez S. Engel F.B. Adhesion GPCRs in kidney development and disease.Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2018; 6: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To know whether the gene is also expressed in canine kidney epithelial MDCK cells, we performed RT-PCR analysis using primer pairs for the regions from exons 6 to 10 (exon 6–10), from exons 13 to 18 (exon 13–18), and within exon 19. As shown in Figure 1B, the three expected PCR products were all obtained, indicating that GPR125 is indeed expressed in MDCK cells. We next transfected MDCK cells with the complementary DNA (cDNA) for wild-type human GPR125 (FLAG–GPR125-FL), in which the 3 × FLAG-tag was inserted between a signal peptide and the full-length protein (amino acid residues 34–1321) (Fig. 1A). Immunoblot analysis of lysates of the transfected cells with an anti-FLAG antibody revealed that FLAG–GPR125-FL was expressed as two major bands with apparent molecular masses of about 170 and 90 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). On the extracellular side, GPR125 contains 13 asparagine residues in the putative glycosylation sequence (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr; Xaa is any amino acid but proline) (18Breitling J. Aebi M. N-linked protein glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a013359Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Consistent with the identity of GPR125 as a glycoprotein, treatment with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase-F) or endoglycosidase H (Endo-H) each resulted in the appearance of a protein with an about 140 kDa (Fig. 1C), which is similar to the predicted molecular mass of unglycosylated FLAG–GPR125-FL. Thus, the upper band observed in the glycosidase-untreated cell lysate (Fig. 1C) likely represents FLAG–GPR125-FL with high-mannose N-glycans. On the other hand, treatment of the lower band (Fig. 1C) with PNGase-F but not with Endo-H produced a 70 kDa protein, indicating that the lower band is a C-terminally cleaved FLAG–GPR125 with complex-type N-glycans. The cleavage may occur at a position in the GAIN domain in the N-terminal extracellular region, according to a predicted molecular mass of the fragment (about 80 kDa). The above findings raise the possibility that GPR125 is autoproteolysed at the GPS in the GAIN domain, although GPR125 has been predicted to be noncleavable in the GAIN domain because of its atypical GPS motif (Ser736-Leu737-Ser738) but not the canonical one (His-Leu/Ile-Ser/Thr) (6Vizurraga A.

Fredriksson R. et al.International union of basic and clinical pharmacology. XCIV. Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors.Pharmacol. Rev. 2015; 67: 338-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To test the role of the GAIN domain in GPR125 cleavage, we expressed mutant proteins lacking the GAIN domain alone (amino acid residues 417–749) or both GAIN domain and HBD (amino acid residues 348–749) in MDCK cells. As shown in Figure 1D, the cleavage was not observed in these mutant proteins, suggesting the involvement of the GAIN domain in autoproteolysis of GPR125. To investigate the significance of the atypical GPS motif in GRP125 cleavage, we expressing an N-terminally Myc-tagged GPR125 protein carrying the S736A/L737A/S738A substitution at the GPS tripeptide (Myc–GPR125-AAA) in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, Myc–GPR125-AAA was not cleaved; it failed to produce the NTF of about 90 kDa, which was detected by the anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1E, upper panel), and the CTF of about 70 kDa (Fig. 1E, lower panel), which was recognized by the antibody against the CTT of GPR125 (Fig. 1F). On the other hand, the efficiency of the cleavage was not enhanced by the substitution of Ser-736 for His (Fig. 1E), a residue conserved in the GPS of most of autocleavable aGPCRs (6Vizurraga A.

Taken together with the present findings, GPR125 appears to be autocleaved at the atypical GPS motif. A variety of GPCRs is known to form a homodimer (19Milligan G.

Cell Biol. 2019; 57: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To know whether GPR125 is also able to interact homophilically, we performed an immunoprecipitation (IP) assay using HEK293 cells coexpressing FLAG–GPR125 with Myc-tagged GPR125 or JAM-A, a single-span transmembrane protein with two Ig domains (23Tuncay H. Ebnet K. Cell adhesion molecule control of planar spindle orientaion.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2018; 73: 1195-1207Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1G, Myc–GPR125 but not Myc–JAM-A was coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG–GPR125, suggestive for self-association of GPR125. When various lengths of GPR125 were coexpressed as Myc-tagged proteins, the 7TM helix bundle alone interacted with FLAG–GPR125 and the interaction was not abrogated by truncation of the ECR or CTT (Fig. 1H). Thus, GPR125 is likely capable of self-associating via the 7TM helix bundle. To investigate the role of GPR125 in epithelial cells, we examined its localization in MDCK cells by expressing FLAG–GPR125-FL and subsequent staining with the anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Figure 2A, FLAG–GPR125 colocalized with β-catenin, a marker protein for the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane, but not with gp135 or ZO-1, which defines the apical membrane or tight junction, respectively. Furthermore, domain-selective cell surface biotinylation analysis revealed that FLAG–GPR125 was detected on the basolateral domain but not the apical surface of the plasma membrane in MDCK cells (Fig. 2B). Thus, GPR125 is recruited to the basolateral membrane in polarized epithelial cells. The present finding that the uncleaved GPR125 exclusively contains high-mannose type N-glycans and the NTF of GPR125 solely bears complex type N-glycans (Fig. 1C) suggests that GPR125 is transported to the plasma membrane after cleavage at the GPS. This is because complex type N-glycans are present in mature glycoproteins on the plasma membrane, whereas glycoproteins residing in the endoplasmic reticulum are of the high-mannose type (24Stanley P. Golgi glycosylation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: a005199Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In addition, judging from the molecular mass of about 90 kDa, the NTF is a major form of the basolaterally localized FLAG–GPR125 (Fig. 2B). To test the possibility that the cleavage of GPR125 is required for its accumulation to the basolateral membrane, we expressed FLAG–GPR125-AAA, a mutant protein with the noncleavable GPS, in MDCK cells and stained with the anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Figure 2C, this mutant protein was distributed to the cytoplasm but not to the plasma membrane. The failure of the GPR125-AAA to localize to the basolateral membrane was confirmed by domain-selective cell surface biotinylation analysis (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the cleavable mutant protein FLAG–GPR125-HLS as well as the wild-type protein efficiently accumulated at the basolateral membrane of MDCK cells (Fig. 2C). These findings raised a possibility that the uncleaved GAIN domain may have an ability to inhibit basolateral recruitment of GPR125. Indeed, mutant GPR125 proteins lacking the GAIN domain (GPR125-ΔGAIN and GPR125-ΔHBD/GAIN) were both able to localize to the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C). Consistent with this, a small but significant amount of these two proteins were resistant to Endo-H, indicative for their localization to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1D). Thus, the uncleaved GAIN domain appears to suppress targeting of GPR125 to the basolateral membrane, which may explain at least partially why the cleavage occurs during an early stage of receptor biosynthesis. GAIN-mediated self-cleavage in aGPCR is generally known to occur constitutively during biosynthesis to produce the two fragments NTF and CTF that remain associated noncovalently (6Vizurraga A.

Chem. 2020; 295: 14065-14083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Langenhan T. Aust G. Hamann J.

Fredriksson R. et al.International union of basic and clinical pharmacology. XCIV. Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors.Pharmacol. Rev. 2015; 67: 338-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To study the association between the NTF and CTF of GPR125, we coexpressed FLAG–GPR125-NTF and Myc–GPR125-CTF in HEK293 cells and performed an IP assay. As shown in Figure 2D, Myc–GPR125-CTF was coprecipitated with FLAG–GPR125-NTF by the anti-FLAG antibody but not by control IgG, suggesting that the separately expressed fragments are able to form a complex. In general, the separately expressed NTF and CTF of aGPCRs do not associate with each other because the N terminus of the isolated CTF, a region that makes direct contacts with the NTF, inserts as a tethered agonist into the 7TM helix bundle and thus fails to associate with the isolated NTF (25Beliu G. Altrichter S. Guixà-González R. Hemberger M. Brauer I. Dahse A.K. et al.Tethered agonist exposure in intact adhesion/class B2 GPCRs through intrinsic structural flexibility of the GAIN domain.Mol.

In the present experiment, the insertion into the 7TM helix bundle may be blocked by the 3 × Myc-tag sequence N-terminal to the CTF, which blockade allows the CTF N terminus to bind to FLAG–GPR125-NTF (Fig. 2D). It is also possible that the GPR125 NTF and CTF can associate in a manner distinct from that of other aGPCRs. Furthermore, in MDCK cells transfected with the cDNA for FLAG–GPR125-FL, the basolateral membrane was stained both with the anti-GPR125 antibody, which recognized the CTT, and with the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2E). These observations are consistent with the idea that after the self-cleavage, the NTF and CTF of GPR125 remain associated at the basolateral membrane. We next clarified the region required for GPR125 localization to the basolateral membrane in polarized epithelial cells. As shown in Figure 3A, not only wild-type GPR125-FL but also mutant proteins without both LRR and Ig-like domain (ΔLRR/Ig) or the entire N-terminal ECR (ΔECR) were capable of localizing to the basolateral membrane in MDCK cells. By contrast, a protein with truncation of the entire CTT (GPR125-ΔCTT) as well as one that contains the 7TM helix bundle but lacks both ECR and CTT (GPR125-7TM) was distributed to the cytoplasm but not to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A). These findings indicate that the CTT of GPR125 is required for its localization to the basolateral membrane in polarized epithelial cells. The CTT of GPR125 contains the extreme C-terminal tetrapeptide Glu-Thr-Thr-Val (amino acid residues 1318–1321), which corresponds to the type I PDZ domain–binding motif (PBM) (30Hung A.Y. Sheng M. PDZ domains: structural modules for protein complex assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the motif in GPR125 localization in polarized epithelial cells, we expressed a mutant protein lacking the last four amino acid residues as a FLAG-tagged protein (FLAG–GPR125-ΔETTV) in MDCK cells. As shown in Figure 3B, the truncation resulted in exclusive localization to the cytoplasm. Thus, the C-terminal PBM is required for recruitment of GPR125 to the basolateral membrane. The CTT of bacterially expressed GPR125 has been reported to directly bind to the PDZ domain containing protein Dlg1 (16Yamamoto Y. Irie K. Asada M. Mino A. Mandai K. Takai Y. Direct binding of the human homologue of the Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor gene to seven-pass transmembrane proteins, tumor endothelial marker 5 (TEM5), and a novel TEM5-like protein.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3889-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To confirm that full-length GPR125 also interacts with Dlg1, we expressed Myc–GPR125-FL and FLAG–Dlg1 in HEK293 cells, followed by a co-IP assay. As shown in Figure 4A, FLAG–Dlg1 interacted with Myc–GPR125-FL but not a mutant protein lacking the C-terminal four amino acid residues of the PBM (Myc–GRP125-ΔETTV). Similarly, endogenous Dlg1 in MDCK cells was coprecipitated with FLAG–GRP125-FL but not with FLAG–GRP125-ΔETTV (Fig. 4B). These findings indicate that GPR125 associates with Dlg1 in a PBM-dependent manner. Consistent with the association, in polarized MDCK cells, FLAG–GPR125 colocalized with endogenous Dlg1 at the basolateral membrane (Fig. 4C). It has been also reported that the CTT of zebrafish GPR125 interacts with Xenopus Dishevelled (Dvl), another PDZ domain–harboring protein (15Li X. Roszko I. Sepich D.S. Ni M. Hamm H.E. Marlow F.L. et al.Gpr125 modulates Dishevelled distribution and planar cell polarity signaling.Development. 2013; 140: 3028-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To know whether human Dvl1 also interacts with the PBM of human GPR125, we performed a co-IP assay using HEK293 cells expressing FLAG–Dvl1 and Myc–GPR125-FL, Myc–GPR125-ΔETTV, or Myc–GPR125-ΔCTT. As shown in Figure 4D, FLAG–Dvl1 associated with Myc–GPR125-FL and the association was abolished by truncation of the entire CTT but not by that of the PBM alone. GPR125 appears to also interact with Dvl1 but mainly in a PBM-independent"

Further investigation of this essential system is important for identifying ways to address antibiotic resistance. Here, we show that a T101M mutation in walR confers a defect in autolysis, a thickened cell wall, and decreased susceptibility to antibiotics that target lipid II cycle, a phenotype that is reminiscent of the clinical resistance form known as vancomycin intermediate-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Importantly, this is accompanied by dramatic sensitization to tunicamycin. We demonstrate that this phenotype is due to partial collapse of a pathway consisting of autolysins, AtlA and Sle1, a transmembrane sugar permease, MurP, and GlcNAc recycling enzymes, MupG and MurQ. We suggest that this causes a shortage of substrate for the peptidoglycan biosynthesis enzyme MraY, causing it to be hypersensitive to competitive inhibition by tunicamycin. In conclusion, our results constitute a new molecular model for antibiotic sensitivity in S. aureus and a promising new route for antibiotic discovery.

In conclusion, our results constitute a new molecular model for antibiotic sensitivity in S. aureus and a promising new route for antibiotic discovery. The steady advance of antibiotic resistance is a significant threat to modern medicine (1Sugden R. Kelly R. Davies S. Combatting antimicrobial resistance globally.Nat.

Antimicrobial resistance: a global multifaceted phenomenon antimicrobial resistance.Pathog. Glob. Health. 2015; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common hospital- and community-acquired opportunistic pathogens, and the fact that it has emerged in resistant forms is therefore especially concerning. The widely disseminated superbug methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has exacerbated virtually all S. aureus infections; ∼20% of human MRSA bacteremias are fatal (3Holland T.L. Arnold C. Fowler V.G. Clinical management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.Clin. Rev. Educ. 2014; 312: 1330-1341Google Scholar). A multidrug resistant form known as vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) has also emerged (4Tenover F.C. Biddle J.W. Lancaster M.V.

Rep. 2020; 10: 12689Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6World Health Organization Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) Report. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2021Google Scholar). Vancomycin intermediate resistance confers low to moderate levels of resistance to antibiotics that target the cell wall and, while this resistance is not a serious clinical burden, VISA-like phenotypes have appeared in combination with methicillin and dalbavancin resistance, generating strains that are more problematic still (7Wang Y.

Developing new drugs to manage resistant strains is, arguably, the most important goal in microbiology (9King A.M. Reid-Yu S.A. Wang W. King D.T. De Pascale G.

Bacterial efflux pump inhibitors from natural sources.J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2007; 59: 1247-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Antibiotics discovered through screens of natural products and synthetic compound libraries yielded the antibiotic scaffolds in current use (11Miethke M. Pieroni M. Weber T. Brönstrup M. Hammann P. Halby L. et al.Towards the sustainable discovery and development of new antibiotics.Nat. Rev. Chem. 2021; 5: 726-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Most of these have since succumbed to antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Chemical remodeling has generated newer compounds that bypass resistance; however, these, in turn, have also given way to new forms of resistance. This steady accumulation of resistance suggests that new approaches to antibiotic discovery are needed. Future approaches will take advantage of new knowledge about the complex molecular networks that determine antibiotic sensitivity and resistance (12Roemer T. Boone C. Systems-level antimicrobial drug and drug synergy discovery.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Vancomycin and ramoplanin are two important antibiotics used to manage Gram-positive infections, including resistant forms such as MRSA. Both target components of lipid II cycle. Low to moderate level multidrug resistance to these antibiotics classified as VISA has been attributed to numerous genetic loci including two-component systems (vraRS, graRS, and walRK), cell wall biosynthetic enzymes (uppS, fmtC, srtA, and msrR), and even RNA polymerase (rpoB) (13Lin L.

Such strains are typically also resistant to daptomycin, another drug of last resort that targets peptidoglycan biosynthesis (16Grein F. Müller A. Scherer K.M. Liu X. Ludwig K.C.

Commun. 2020; 11: 1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Additional phenotypic traits such as a thickened cell wall and compromised autolysis suggest that defects in cell wall homeostasis underlie this resistance (17Cui L. Murakami H. Kuwahara-arai K.

At present however, we lack a detailed molecular description of the VISA cell. In previous work, we isolated S. aureus mutants that were resistant to the antibiotics siamycin-I and actinorhodin (19Tan S. Ludwig K.C. Mueller A. Schneider T. Nodwell J.R.

A fascinating element in this mechanism is that, in addition to WalK, a eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr kinase, PknB, also phosphorylates WalR (27Hardt P. Engels I. Rausch M. Gajdiss M. Ulm H. Sass P. et al.The cell wall precursor lipid II acts as a molecular signal for the Ser/Thr kinase PknB of Staphylococcus aureus.Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2017; 307: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The sites of WalR phosphorylation are distinct: WalK phosphorylates D53, and PknB phosphorylates T101 (27Hardt P. Engels I. Rausch M. Gajdiss M. Ulm H. Sass P. et al.The cell wall precursor lipid II acts as a molecular signal for the Ser/Thr kinase PknB of Staphylococcus aureus.Int. J. Med.

Lee J.Y.H. et al.Zinc-binding to the cytoplasmic PAS domain regulates the essential WalK histidine kinase of Staphylococcus aureus.Nat Commun. 2019; 10: 3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This is a remarkable departure from the two-component paradigm; very few response regulators are known to be phosphorylated at two sites. At present, the molecular role of phosphorylation at T101 is not well understood. WalR regulates genes involved in cell wall homeostasis. This includes several autolysin genes known for their sugar-cleaving and peptide-cleaving activity within the peptidoglycan layer permitting cell wall growth (29Dubrac S. Boneca I.G. Poupel O. Msadek T. New insights into the WalK/WalR (YycG/YycF) essential signal tTransduction pathway reveal a major role in controlling cell wall metabolism and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8257-8269Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In this work, we report a detailed investigation of a walR point mutant that changes T101 to a methionine, eliminating the site thought to be phosphorylated by PknB. We show that this mutation confers resistance to vancomycin, ramoplanin, daptomycin, and several other antibiotics that target the cell envelope. It also has a thickened cell wall and impaired autolysis; reminiscent of clinical VISA. Surprisingly, we also find that the mutant is exquisitely sensitive to the antibiotic tunicamycin, which targets the enzymes MraY and TarO, involved in peptidoglycan and teichoic acid biosynthesis, respectively (30Meredith T.C. Swoboda J.G. Walker S. Late-stage polyribitol phosphate wall teichoic acid biosynthesis in Staphylococcus aureus.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3046-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This is the first indication that there is a connection between these pathways, and it suggests that in addition to its direct targets, there are indirect effects of wal gene mutations that make important contributions to antibiotic sensitivity and resistance. Remarkably, tunicamycin-resistant mutants selected in the walR mutant background reversed all the phenotypes described thus far, demonstrating a foundational molecular linkage. Using RNA-Seq, we found that the partial collapse of a pathway consisting of two autolysins and the peptidoglycan-recycling proteins, MupG, MurQ, and MurP, explains most of the antibiotic sensitivity and resistance in this mutant. With these data in hand, we have developed the first detailed molecular model for how a mutation in the wal operon can confer both vancomycin resistance and tunicamycin sensitivity. This in turn suggests that understanding wal operon mutants such as the one we described in this work will open up new opportunities for antibiotic discovery. We selected a representative mutant from our previous work (20Mak S. Nodwell J.R. Actinorhodin is a redox-active antibiotic with a complex mode of action against Gram-positive cells.Mol. Microbiol. 2017; 106: 597-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) encoding a T101M alteration in WalR. This strain has no other chromosome sequence changes relative to its congenic parent, S. aureus ATCC29213; we refer to this mutation as walR1 (BioProject: PRJNA833295). This mutant is of particular interest because it alters the site of phosphorylation by PknB, one of the least understood aspects of this mechanism. We determined the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of walR1 and the parent strain for antibiotics that act on the five major antimicrobial targets (Table 1). The walR1 mutant exhibited reduced sensitivity to vancomycin (two-fold), siamycin-I (four-fold), ramoplanin (four-fold), and daptomycin (two-fold), all of which target the cell wall or membrane. It also exhibited reduced sensitivity to rifampicin (two-fold), which targets RNA polymerase. In contrast, there was no change in sensitivity to the penicillin-binding protein (PBP)–targeting β-lactam ampicillin or to compounds that target DNA gyrase (ciprofloxacin), the folate pathway (trimethoprim), and the ribosome (kanamycin). Aside from rifampicin, the strain’s resistance profile was restricted to compounds that act via lipid II pathway (vancomycin, siamycin-I, and ramoplanin) and the cell membrane (daptomycin).Table 1MICs of each strain against a panel of antibioticsMIC (μg/ml)DrugWildtypewalR1walR1–walKtunTunicamycin80.1258Siamycin-I166416Ramoplanin0.521Vancomycin121Mecillinam643264Cefaclor10.51Cefoxitin212Oxacillin0.1250.1250.125Ceftriaxone222Daptomycin121Ciprofloxacin0.250.250.25Kanamycin888Rifampicin0.00780.01560.0078Trimethoprim222 Open table in a new tab To our considerable surprise, the walR1 mutant also exhibited a 64-fold increase in susceptibility to tunicamycin with a change in MIC from 8 to 0.125 μg/ml. The effect was bactericidal (Fig. 1A). Tunicamycin targets the MraY and TarO proteins, involved in the early steps of peptidoglycan and teichoic acid biosynthesis, respectively (30Meredith T.C. Swoboda J.G. Walker S. Late-stage polyribitol phosphate wall teichoic acid biosynthesis in Staphylococcus aureus.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3046-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We therefore expanded this analysis to more selective cell wall–targeting β-lactams (31Georgopapadakou N.H. Smith S.A. Bonner D.P. Penicillin-binding proteins in a Staphylococcus aureus strain resistant to specific B-lactam antibiotics.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 22: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We observed no change in sensitivity to oxacillin (PBP2 and PBP3 specific) and ceftriaxone (PBP2 specific) and a twofold increase in sensitivity to mecillinam and cefaclor (PBP3 specific), and cefoxitin (PBP4 specific) (Table 1). The dramatic 64-fold increase in sensitivity to tunicamycin was specific to that antibiotic. This is unusual—we know of no other example where resistance to one set of antibiotics comes at the cost of such extreme sensitivity to another. To better understand this phenomenon, we isolated six nonsibling tunicamycin-resistant mutants (tunR1–6) in the walR1 background. All six mutants displayed tunicamycin sensitivity comparable to the wildtype parent strain (MIC = 8 μg/ml). Upon whole-genome sequencing of these mutants, we found that five had sequence changes in the walK gene. Four mapped to the “lid” motif in the ATP-binding pocket and one at the cytoplasmic face of the second transmembrane helix of WalK (Fig. 1B). The sixth suppressor mutation was found within the clpP gene (C478T nucleotide change), which encodes a highly conserved ATP-dependent protease (32Porankiewicz J. Wang J. Clarke A.K. New insights into the ATP-dependent clp protease: escherichia coli and beyond.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and is predicted to cause a ClpP truncation (Table S3). The T101M sequence change of the walR1 allele was unchanged in all six strains. The fact that five of the six mutations in these strains mapped within walK underscores the intimate connection between the wal operon and antibiotic activity in S. aureus. To continue this investigation, we selected a mutant that has a single sequence change relative to the walR1 mutant, namely a R555C polymorphism in the WalK ATP-binding pocket, for further characterization (Fig. 1C). This mutant is henceforth referred to as walKtun. Remarkably, the walR1–walKtun double mutant exhibited normal sensitivity to vancomycin, siamycin-I, daptomycin, mecillinam, cefaclor and cefoxitin, rifampicin, as well as tunicamycin (Table 2). This suggests that the mutations found in the walR1 and walKtun strains are toggling the physiological state of the cell between two states. It also underscores the fact that walRK-mediated resistance to vancomycin and other antibiotics comes at the cost of sensitivity to tunicamycin: these phenotypes change in lock step fashion.Table 2MICs of walR1 complemented with an empty vector (+EV) control or the mur operon (+pGQP)MIC (μg/ml)Drug+EV+pGQPTunicamycin0.25> 8Siamycin-I6416Ramoplanin11Vancomycin42Cefaclor11Cefoxitin24Daptomycin168Ciprofloxacin0.50.5Kanamycin88Rifampicin0.00780.0039 Open table in a new tab To determine whether the effects of walR1 and walR1–walKtun on antibiotic responsiveness extended to other phenotypes, we investigated changes in cell structure and growth. We found that the growth curves of the wildtype, walR1, and walR1–walKtun strains were similar with generation times of 23.4, 23.1, and 21.5 min, respectively (Fig. 2A). We visualized log phase cells of the three strains using transmission electron microscopy to compare their cell wall thickness and cell division status. Consistent with the literature for wildtype S. aureus and wal mutants (18Howden B.P. McEvoy C.R. Allen D.L. Chua K. Gao W. Harrison P.F. et al.Evolution of multidrug resistance during Staphylococcus aureus infection involves mutation of the essential two component regulator WalKR.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7e1002359Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), wildtype cells exhibited a cell wall thickness of 34.1 ± 1.4 nm. In contrast, the walR1 mutant exhibited a cell wall thickness of 53.9 ± 0.9 nm. The cell wall of the walR1–walKtun strain was almost identical to that of the wildtype parent at 30.7 ± 0.8 nm (Fig. 2B). Despite this difference in cell wall thickness, the cell wall composition was similar between wildtype and walR1 bacteria (Fig. S1 and Table S4). We compared the septation state of 350 cells for each of the wildtype, walR1, and walR1–walKtun strains (Fig. 2C). This analysis revealed that 42.6% of wildtype cells had clear division septa or preseptal invagination with no observable evidence of a division septum in the other 57.4%. In contrast, 61.4% of the walR1 mutant cells showed division septa and 38.6% did not. The walR1–walKtun cells resembled the wildtype with 43.1% of cells displaying a division septum and 56.9% exhibiting no division septum. The apparent differences in the distribution of cells having septa suggest that walR1 bacteria might be slightly impaired in transit through septation and on to the separation of daughter cells, though apparently, this defect does not alter the growth rate. Most importantly, the effects of the walR1 mutation on cell wall thickness and septation were reversed in the walR1–walKtun mutant. It is known that wal operon mutations alter the expression of autolysin genes (29Dubrac S. Boneca I.G. Poupel O. Msadek T. New insights into the WalK/WalR (YycG/YycF) essential signal tTransduction pathway reveal a major role in controlling cell wall metabolism and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8257-8269Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the autolysis profile of each strain. To this end, we resuspended exponential phase cells in 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100 and measured the absorbance at 600 nm of each suspension as a function of time. Consistent with published reports, wildtype S. aureus underwent efficient autolysis: culture turbidity decreased by 59% over the 6 h time course. In contrast, the walR1 mutant displayed reduced lysis in the presence of the detergent as culture turbidity decreased by only 30% over 6 h with readily distinguishable kinetics. The walR1–walKtun mutant displayed a more normal autolytic profile with a 72% reduction in culture turbidity indicating that the R555C substitution in WalK again suppressed the effects of the T101M mutation in WalR (Fig. 2D). To further analyze autolysis, we adapted an established biochemical assay to monitor autolysin activity in vitro (33Vaz F. Filipe S.R. Preparation and analysis of Crude autolytic enzyme extracts from Staphylococcus aureus.eLife. 2015; 5https://doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We derived protein extracts from each strain and assessed their capacity to degrade peptidoglycan isolated from the wildtype parent over 24 h using absorbance measured at 600 nm to monitor progression. The wildtype S. aureus extract caused a 49% reduction in turbidity over the time course, whereas the walR1 mutant extract caused only a 30% reduction. As in previous experiments, the walR1–walKtun strain exhibited restored peptidoglycan degradation with a 44% reduction in turbidity (Fig. 2E). These data demonstrate that the walR1 mutation reduces autolysin activity and that the walR1–walKtun mutation restores it. Again, all phenotypes change in lock step, consistent with an integrated cause-and-effect relationship. A plausible hypothesis is that the myriad effects of the walR1 and walR1–walKtun mutations are caused by altered expression of the WalR regulon. Given that walKR is essential for viability, we surmised that the walR1 mutation is partially defective in WalRK-mediated signal transduction and that walKtun might reverse its effects, restoring a more normal transcriptome. To determine how WalR regulated gene expression is affected in the walR1 and the walR1–walKtun strains, we carried out an RNA-Seq analysis (transcriptomic data are accessible through Gene Expression Omnibus Series accession number GSE211745). We first compared transcript abundance in wildtype S. aureus with the walR1 mutant strain. Consistent with previous work, we observed reduced transcript abundance in at least two known WalR-target genes, atlA and sle1, both of which encode autolysins (29Dubrac S. Boneca I.G. Poupel O. Msadek T. New insights into the WalK/WalR (YycG/YycF) essential signal tTransduction pathway reveal a major role in controlling cell wall metabolism and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8257-8269Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). AtlA is a bifunctional glucosaminidase (GM) and amidase (AM). AtlAGM cleaves the β-1,4-glycosidic bond between GlcNAc and MurNAc, whereas AtlAAM removes the stem peptide from MurNAc. Sle1 is also an N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase and acts on the same substrate as AtlAAM (34Vollmer W. Joris B. Charlier P. Foster S. Bacterial peptidoglycan (murein) hydrolases.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 259-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3E). Transcript abundance for the lytM-encoded autolysin was unchanged and, paradoxically, that of sceD appeared to be increased (Fig. 3A). A reduction in atlA and sle1 transcript abundance is consistent with reduced autolysis in the walR1 mutant. In addition however, we observed reduced transcript abundance for the monocistronic genes glpQ and glpT, involved in glycerophosphate recycling (35Jorge A.M. Schneider J. Unsleber S. Göhring N. Mayer C. Peschel A. Utilization of glycerophosphodiesters by Staphylococcus aureus.Mol. Microbiol. 2017; 103: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), as well as the mupG murQ murP murR operon, which encodes a peptidoglycan-recycling pathway (36Kluj R.M. Ebner P. Adamek M. Ziemert N. Mayer C. Borisova M. Recovery of the peptidoglycan turnover product released by the autolysin Atl in Staphylococcus aureus involves the phosphotransferase system transporter MurP and the novel 6-phospho-N-acetylmuramidase MupG.Front. Microbiol. 2018; 9: 2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The products of this operon include a transmembrane permease (MurP), which imports GlcNAc–MurNAc, the products of autolysis, into the cytoplasm and phosphorylates it. MupG hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond and forms GlcNAc and MurNAc-6-phosphate as end products. MurQ then converts MurNAc-6-phosphate into GlcNAc-6-phosphate (36Kluj R.M. Ebner P. Adamek M. Ziemert N. Mayer C. Borisova M. Recovery of the peptidoglycan turnover product released by the autolysin Atl in Staphylococcus aureus involves the phosphotransferase system transporter MurP and the novel 6-phospho-N-acetylmuramidase MupG.Front.

Mühleck M. et al.Peptidoglycan recycling in gram-positive bacteria is crucial for survival in stationary phase.mBio. 2016; 7e00923-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3D). MurR is a putative repressor of the mupG promoter that presumably regulates the expression of all four genes. The entire operon was downregulated in walR1. This is the first evidence of a possible link between the expression of these cell wall recycling genes and WalR. Based on the ability of the walKtun mutation to toggle the walR1 mutant back to an approximately wildtype phenotype, we hypothesized that the most important genes that were downregulated in walR1 would be upregulated in walR1–walKtun. Therefore, we performed a differential expression analysis comparing our walR1–walKtun double mutant relative to the parental walR1 mutant. This analysis revealed that transcript abundance for autolysins, atlA and sle1, was upregulated, whereas sceD was downregulated and lytM remained unchanged. The genes involved in glycerophosphate and peptidoglycan recycling were also upregulated (Fig. 3B). This analysis further corroborates the suppressor effect of the WalK R555C mutation of the walR1–walKtun mutant on the tunicamycin-sensitive walR1 strain. More importantly, it also suggests that one or both these cell wall recycling pathways might underpin the effects of the walR1 mutation on tunicamycin sensitivity. We were particularly interested in the mupG"

Serum Cystatin-C is used to monitor renal function and detect kidney damage. Recent research has focused on linking Cystatin-C to cardiovascular risk and disease, but most findings focus on small sample sizes and generalize poorly to diverse populations, thus limiting epidemiological inferences. The aim of this manuscript is to study the association between Cystatin-C, diabetes, and mortality and test for possible sex or racial/ethnic background modifications in these relationships.We analyzed 8-years of biennial panel data from Health and Retirement Study participants 50-years and older who self-identified as White (unweighted N (uN) = 5,595), Black (uN = 867), or Latino (uN = 565) for a total of uN = 7,027 individuals. We modeled diabetes and death over 8-years as function of baseline Cystatin-C (log transformed) adjusting for covariates and tested modifications in associations by race/ethnic background and sex.Mean log Cystatin-C at visit 1 was 0.03±0.32 standard deviation. A 10% increase in Cystatin-C levels was associated with 13% increased relative risk of diabetes at baseline (11% and 9% by years 4 and 8). A 10% increase in Cystatin-C was highly associated with increased relative risk of death (28% and 31% by years 4 and 8). These associations were present even after adjusting for possible confounders and were not modified by sex or racial/ethnic background.Despite differential risks for diabetes and mortality by racial/ethnic groups, Cystatin-C was equally predictive of these outcomes across groups. Cystatin-C dysregulations could be used as a risk indicator for diabetes and as a warning sign for accelerated risk of mortality."

The local ecological knowledge is a reservoir that generates full wellbeing and for which it must be the object of protection and local development. In this study, we aimed to find which factors can influence local ecological knowledge from a metacommunity on the Patagonian steppe. We analyzed variation in knowledge about cultivated and gathered plants used as medicinal, edible, and firewood according to multiple factors widely discussed in the ethnobiological literature: age, gender, formal education, occupation, indigenous identity, contact with urban centers, use of biomedicine, hunting, and handcrafted textile production. We conducted semi-structured interviews with local experts, accessed by the snowball technique. We found that formal education is a key factor in the variation of local ecological knowledge among people. In addition, we found that knowledge varies between people who practice activities inside and outside the home, concentrating knowledge between cultivated and gathered plants, respectively. Our urbanization proxies did not point to an influence of this factor on local knowledge, but specialists living in a larger community with signs of internal urbanization processes had much less knowledge. Our results allowed us to visualize the importance of studying metacommunities as a whole, to verify complexities and intersections of overlapping factors. Studies in metacommunities open up a range of possibilities for ethnobiological analysis."
https://openalex.org/W4294958435,"The membrane-bound complex II family of proteins is composed of enzymes that catalyze succinate and fumarate interconversion coupled with reduction or oxidation of quinones within the membrane domain. The majority of complex II enzymes are protein heterotetramers with the different subunits harboring a variety of redox centers. These redox centers are used to transfer electrons between the site of succinate-fumarate oxidation/reduction and the membrane domain harboring the quinone. A covalently bound FAD cofactor is present in the flavoprotein subunit, and the covalent flavin linkage is absolutely required to enable the enzyme to oxidize succinate. Assembly of the covalent flavin linkage in eukaryotic cells and many bacteria requires additional protein assembly factors. Here, we provide mechanistic details for how the assembly factors work to enhance covalent flavinylation. Both prokaryotic SdhE and mammalian SDHAF2 enhance FAD binding to their respective apoprotein of complex II. These assembly factors also increase the affinity for dicarboxylates to the apoprotein-noncovalent FAD complex and stabilize the preassembly complex. These findings are corroborated by previous investigations of the roles of SdhE in enhancing covalent flavinylation in both bacterial succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase flavoprotein subunits and of SDHAF2 in performing the same function for the human mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein. In conclusion, we provide further insight into assembly factor involvement in building complex II flavoprotein subunit active site required for succinate oxidation."

At present, however, we know very little about the binding properties, origins, and sequences of these antibodies because of a lack of access to a variety of defined individual antibodies.

However, few details are available for the specific antibodies that bind to those glycans. For example, recognition of the various glycans could be due to: (1) a small number of polyreactive antibodies, (2) a mixture of many different highly selective antiglycan antibodies, or (3) some combination of various polyreactive and selective antibodies. In addition, it is not known if they are highly polyclonal or largely oligoclonal at the sequence level. We know very little about which V, D, and J genes are used to construct antiglycan antibodies, or how the immune system evolves and mutates those antibodies during the course of infection (16Polonskaya Z. Savage P.B. Finn M.G. Teyton L. High-affinity anti-glycan antibodies: challenges and strategies.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2019; 59: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Antiglycan antibodies are often thought to have broad specificity and low affinity, but these generalizations are based on very limited information (17Engström H.A. Andersson P.O. Ohlson S.

Soc. 2010; 132: 10239-10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A key barrier to answering these questions is a lack of access to individual antiglycan antibodies, especially human antiglycan antibodies. Unlike antibodies to protein or peptide targets, generating monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to many glycan targets remains an elusive challenge in the field (20Haji-Ghassemi O. Blackler R.J. Martin Young N. Evans S.V. Antibody recognition of carbohydrate epitopes.Glycobiology. 2015; 25: 920-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The dearth of antiglycan antibodies can be attributed to a combination of poor immunogenicity and the natural expression of glycans in healthy mammalian tissues, reducing the effectiveness of traditional hybridoma technologies. Alternative routes, such as in vitro selection platforms, have had some success in expanding the glycobiology toolbox with synthetic antibodies. Recent examples include the development of smart antiglycan reagents from lamprey lymphocyte receptors, nanobodies from alpacas, and phage display–derived antiheparan sulfate single-chain variable antibody fragment and anti-Tn single-chain variable antibody fragment (21McKitrick T.R.

While these are promising tools, the complexities of glycan structure, inherently weak protein–glycan monovalent interactions, and limited availability to high-purity glycans for selection procedures present unmet challenges in the field. To complicate matters, many of the commercially available antiglycan mAbs are proprietary clones or hybridoma supernatants, lacking both sequence information and affinity and selectivity characterization. As a result, there are only a few hundred human antiglycan antibodies that have been reported to date, and sequence information is only available for about 240 of them (25Sterner E. Flanagan N. Gildersleeve J.C. Perspectives on anti-glycan antibodies gleaned from development of a community resource database.ACS Chem. Biol. 2016; 11: 1773-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, 70% of the sequenced antibodies target S. pneumoniae polysaccharides or HIV glycans, illustrating the limited spectrum of known human antiglycan antibodies. While there are a higher number of reported antiglycan antibodies of mouse origin (including about 350 for which sequences are available), these also target a limited assortment of glycan antigens. Furthermore, using the published antiglycan mouse antibody sequences, germline usage, mutation rates, and even productive glycan epitopes to infer key characteristics of human antiglycan antibodies is of limited benefit to vaccine or therapeutic discovery efforts. Finally, many of the published mAbs are not a random sampling of antibodies produced in a mammal; they are typically isolated following a specific antigen challenge and selected from a broader pool of antibodies based on developability characteristics or clone stability. Therefore, they are not an accurate representation of the repertoire of antiglycan antibodies produced by a mammal. To gain a better understanding of the types and characteristics of antiglycan antibodies produced in humans, we sought to obtain a sampling of antibodies targeting a variety of glycan antigens. Most screening strategies or mAb development methods are designed to obtain selective and high-quality antibodies to a one or a few antigens (26Pedrioli A. Oxenius A. Single b cell technologies for monoclonal antibody discovery.Trends Immunol. 2021; 42: 1143-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For example, one strategy involves using fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate B cells that bind a fluorophore-labeled antigen (27Joseph H. Tan Q.Y. Mazhari R. Eriksson E.M. Schofield L. Vaccine-induced carbohydrate-specific memory B cells reactivate during rodent malaria infection.Front. Immunol. 2019; 10: 1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 28Escolano A. Gristick H.B.

Oliveira T.Y. et al.Immunization expands B cells specific to HIV-1 V3 glycan in mice and macaques.Nature. 2019; 570: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). While this strategy works nicely for a small number of antigens, it is impractical for screening against hundreds of antigens and remains particularly difficult for many types of carbohydrates. To overcome these limitations, we screened a panel of antibodies from healthy human subjects against our 800+ component glycan microarray (29Campbell C.T. Zhang Y. Gildersleeve J.C. Construction and use of glycan microarrays.Curr. Protoc. Chem. Biol. 2010; 2: 37-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Manimala J. Li Z. Jain A. VedBrat S. Gildersleeve J.C. Carbohydrate array analysis of anti-Tn antibodies and lectins reveals unexpected specificities: implications for diagnostic and vaccine development.ChembioChem. 2005; 6: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we cloned and expressed 400 antigen agnostic mAbs from a variety of human B-cell subsets to characterize their biophysical properties (31Shehata L. Maurer D.P. Wec A.Z. Lilov A. Champney E. Sun T. et al.Affinity maturation enhances antibody specificity but compromises conformational stability.Cell Rep. 2019; 28: 3300-3308.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here, we screened 373 of these and an additional 143 antibodies on our glycan microarray to identify a variety of human antiglycan antibodies (Fig. 1). By profiling this collection of antibodies against our library of carbohydrates, we analyzed approximately 400,000 potential antibody–carbohydrate interactions. Since the antibodies were isolated from different subsets of B cells, the study also allowed us to evaluate which types of B cells most frequently produce antiglycan antibodies. The results provide insight into the cellular origins and binding specificities of human antiglycan antibodies and have implications for developing antiglycan antibody diagnostics and therapeutics. A panel of human mAbs composed of 373 previously documented sequences and 143 newly described sequences (see Supporting Excel document) was used for the study (31Shehata L. Maurer D.P. Wec A.Z. Lilov A. Champney E. Sun T. et al.Affinity maturation enhances antibody specificity but compromises conformational stability.Cell Rep. 2019; 28: 3300-3308.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). mAbs were isolated from long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs; CD19−CD38+CD138+), immunoglobulin M (IgM) memory (IgM+CD27+), immunoglobulin G (IgG) memory (IgG+CD27+), and naïve (IgM+CD27−CD10−) B cells using an antigen-agnostic sorting strategy. Natively paired antibody heavy- and light-chain variable regions were cloned and expressed in a proprietary Streptococcus cerevisiae strain engineered to express human IgG1 (32Bornholdt Z.A. Turner H.L. Murin C.D. Li W. Sok D. Souders C.A. et al.Isolation of potent neutralizing antibodies from a survivor of the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak.Science. 2016; 351: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The panel was composed of 516 unique sequence-verified human IgG1 mAbs cloned from 169 IgG memory, 175 LLPCs, 95 IgM memory, and 77 naïve/early emigrant/immature B cells. The early emigrant and immature B cells were two new subsets cloned included in this study. In addition to sequence information, polyreactivity scores, melting temperatures, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) retention times were available for most antibodies. To reduce the total number of microarrays needed for the evaluation, we explored the possibility of screening pools of antibodies. Two of the main concerns with a pooled screen were the hit rate and the potential complications of polyreactive antibodies. If the hit rate is too high, then deconvolution of the pools becomes quite difficult. Moreover, a high proportion of polyreactive antibodies could make the pooled signals nearly impossible to deconvolute. Therefore, we tested approximately 100 antibodies individually to assess the potential hit rate and frequency of polyreactive antibodies. These antibodies were screened at a concentration of 10 μg/ml on a glycan microarray containing approximately 738 different N- and O-linked glycans, glycans from glycolipids, glycopeptides, and glycoproteins (29Campbell C.T. Zhang Y. Gildersleeve J.C. Construction and use of glycan microarrays.Curr. Protoc. Chem. Biol. 2010; 2: 37-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the first barriers we encountered from this original screen was that many antibodies had substantial signals to several components on the array, including highly negatively charged glycosaminoglycan oligomers (3 of the 31 glycosaminoglycans on the array; components #570, #587, and particularly Hep-Octa-GT24 #738), KDOα2-8KDOα2-4KDOα (component #539), dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA) (component #481), and Galα1–4Gal-carboxyethylthioethyl (CETE) (component #31). Several lines of evidence indicated that this was an artifact, potentially caused by antibody aggregation and/or partial denaturation as a result of the antibody isolation process and storage conditions. First, the magnitude of the signals to the glycosaminoglycan oligomers increased with higher negative charge but did not follow a clear structure–activity relationship based on the carbohydrate sequence, suggesting that the interaction was primarily driven by nonspecific charge–charge interactions. Second, approximately half of the antibodies had signals to KDOα2-8KDOα2-4KDOα (component #539) or Galα1–4Gal (component #31) only when presented on a CETE linker. These antibodies failed to bind to three closely related KDO oligosaccharides or other Galα1–4Gal disaccharides presented with different linkers. Third, several negative control antibodies with known protein epitopes were found to bind to neoglycoproteins and other array components following purification and storage. Finally, many of these signals were eliminated when the antibodies were reanalyzed after preparative size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), supporting the theory that these signals were artifacts because of aggregation and/or partially denatured material. We endeavored to characterize these artifacts and the factors contributing to their emergence. mAb purification via capture on Protein A affinity resin and subsequent low pH elution is a common and well-accepted method to obtain research grade mAbs. A number of reports provide evidence that low pH exposure during antibody processing contributes to the appearance of aggregates and misfolded protein (33Wälchli R. Ressurreição M. Vogg S. Feidl F.

A. 2015; 1415: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To determine if a low pH exposure would produce binding artifacts on the neoglycoprotein microarray, we treated SEC-purified antibodies with an acidic buffer (100 mM glycine, pH 2.5) for 5 min followed by neutralization (1.0 M Tris, pH 8.0). We evaluated the effects of this low pH treatment on trastuzumab, human IgG isotype control, ADI-45429 and ADI-47319. (Note: ADI-45429 was found in the initial screen and thought to bind to many of the polyreactive components [Fig. 2A] and ADI-47319 was identified as a glycan binding mAb from the screen). As shown in Figure 2B, all SEC-purified mAbs tested initially showed little to no binding to Hep-Octa-GT24 (component #738), KDOα2-8KDOα2-4KDOα (component #539), DNP-BSA (component #481), or Galα1–4Gal-CETE (component #31). Acidification and subsequent neutralization of trastuzumab resulted in significant binding to array components #539 and #481. Elevated levels to #31 and #738 were also observed. The number of extra signals and their intensity was dependent on the individual antibody tested. IgG isotype control and ADI-45429 developed strong signals to all four array components. Acidification of ADI-47319 showed significant binding to the highly charged GAG #738, while also having moderately increased signals to other components. Analytical SEC traces are shown in Fig. S1. Traces in red suggest that higher molecular weight (MW) species are enriched in the acid-treated samples relative to the original preparations. Antibody storage was another potential source of aggregation or misfolding. To evaluate storage conditions, we diluted SEC-purified mAbs to 1 mg/ml into PBS and subjected them to nine rounds of freeze–thaw cycles. Trastuzumab and ADI-45429 were analyzed on the array following each round of freeze–thaw cycle. As shown in Figure 2C, both antibodies developed significant signals to KDOα2-8KDOα2-4KDOα (component #539) and DNP-BSA (component #481). Signal strength increased with each round of freeze–thaw cycle. Images of trastuzumab on the array in Fig. S2 demonstrate the appearance of signals to DNP-BSA and KDOα2-8KDOα2-4KDOα following freeze–thaw cycles (Fig. S2B) when compared with the SEC-purified mAb on the array (Fig. S2A). HPLC SEC traces of the freeze–thaw cycled mAbs (green traces, Fig. S1) were similar to the unfrozen mAbs, indicating that the aggregation/misfolding was nearly undetectable using traditional HPLC analytical SEC methods despite producing significant artifacts on the array. We next investigated storage additives in an attempt to prevent these artifacts from emerging in the future. Freeze–thaw cycling was performed with 1% BSA and 0.2 M trehalose, two commonly used stabilizers. Gratifyingly, both BSA and trehalose offered significant protection from spurious signals on the array following freeze–thaw cycles. Data for #539 and #481 are shown in Fig. S3. Because these experiments suggest that binding to certain array components indicates low-quality antibody, we opted to exclude antibodies that only bound to several of the most highly charged glycosaminoglycans (3 of the 31 glycosaminoglycans on the array; components #570, 587, and 738), Galα1–4Gal-CETE #31, or KDOα2-8KDOα2-4KDOα #539 (but not the other KDO-containing glycans on the array) when identifying antiglycan antibodies from the panel. It is possible that these exclusion criteria may have precluded the identification of antiglycan antibodies that truly target these glycans, but this was necessary to avoid numerous false positives. We reasoned that any antiglycan antibodies should have produced signals to some of the structurally related components on the array and would have been further characterized. From our initial screen and the polyreactivity scores for the antibodies, we anticipated an antiglycan antibody hit rate of about 1 to 5% and a frequency of polyreactive antibodies of about 1 to 5%. Therefore, we decided to screen groups of antibodies in a two-dimensional 12 × 16 pooled matrix, with each antibody screened at a concentration of approximately 10 μg/ml. In this pooled strategy, antibodies would be screened twice in separate groups of 12 and 16 antibodies. With a combined 2 to 10% hit rate, deconvolution of positive hits present in both pools would be feasible. Using the pooled antibody strategy, we screened the full panel of 516 antibodies on our 738-component microarray. From this screen, we identified 24 candidate antiglycan antibodies. During the course of these studies, we obtained a variety of additional glycans and then printed new glycan microarrays with 816 array components. To evaluate reproducibility of the pooled screen and determine if there were any antibodies to the new components, we repeated the screen on the 816-component microarray. Each of the hits from the original screen were identified again, along with two additional antibodies that bound newly acquired glycans that were not present on the original 738-component array. These results demonstrate good reproducibility of the screen and suggest that there may be a significant number of additional antiglycan antibodies in the panel that recognize glycans not present on our microarray. Each of the 26 candidate hits from the pooled screen was evaluated individually on the array at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Furthermore, each of the hits was also re-expressed recombinantly in mammalian cells as a human IgG1, purified by protein A, and retested on the array at four concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 100 μg/ml. Overall, we obtained 17 antibodies with an estimated apparent KD value ≤150 nM to at least one glycan, five antibodies with weak but measurable binding to one or more glycans, two antibodies that were polyreactive, and two antibodies with inconsistent results. The two inconsistent antibodies displayed good binding using the original samples produced in yeast but no binding when they were re-expressed in mammalian cells. Taken together, the screen had an overall hit rate of ∼5% and a hit rate of “good” antiglycan antibodies (i.e., antibodies with apparent KD values ≤150 nM) of around 3%. The antibodies isolated in the screen targeted a wide variety of glycan antigens (Table 1). The majority of antibodies bound glycans found in bacterial and/or fungal cell walls, but several bound mammalian and plant glycans. Later, we describe the targets and selectivities for a subset of the antiglycan antibodies. Bar graphs illustrating binding profiles for the 24 consistent antibodies can be found in Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figs. S4–S6. In cases where a natural source of a glycan was readily available, we also carried out additional binding studies for validation.Table 1Human antiglycan mAbs identified by pooled matrix neoglycoprotein microarray screenNameB-cell subsetGlycan nameGlycan determinantApp KD (nM)Reactivity scoreHIC retentionModerate- to high-affinity glycan-binding mAbs ADI-45474LLPCGb4 and iso-Gb4GalNAcβ1–3Galα1–4Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ∼400.03ND ADI-47319IgG memoryHyaluronic acidTerminal GlcAβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–4GlcAβ1–3∼200.00ND ADI-47213IgM memoryBlood group BGalα1–3(Fucα1–2)GlcNAc∼1500.009.08 ADI-47201IgG memoryHeparosanGlcNAcα1–4GlcAβ1–4∼200.008.94 ADI-47289IgG memoryGlucoseGlc-β∼50.008.88 ADI-47217IgG memoryHyaluronic acidTerminal GlcAβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–4GlcAβ1–3∼1800.009.10 ADI-47073IgG memoryGalactanGalβ1–4Galβ∼400.008.83 ADI-45440IgG memoryHyaluronic acidTerminal GlcNAcβ1–4GlcAβ1–3GlcNAcβ<50.009.02 ADI-47180IgG memoryLewis B, CF3-LeYFucα1–2Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc∼1000.008.73 ADI-47173IgG memoryXylan/celluloseEither Glcβ1–4Glcβ or Xylβ1–4Xylβ∼400.008.47 ADI-47119IgG memoryLNT/Lewis C/type 1Terminal Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ∼500.009.26 ADI-47133LLPCGlcNAcα1–4GalGlcNAcα1–4Gal∼1500.009.57 ADI-47114LLPCChitinGlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ∼800.009.24 ADI-45379IgG memoryPNAG/dPNAGGlcNβ1–6GlcNβ∼100.008.79 ADI-45393IgM memoryLinear β-mannanManβ1–4Manβ∼1500.008.84 ADI-47198IgG memoryβ1–2 glucanGlcβ1–2Glcβ<50.008.93 ADI-47095LLPCChitinGlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ∼800.099.02Weak glycan-binding mAbs ADI-45404LLPCGA2diGalNAcβ1–4Galβ>10000.008.86 ADI-45497IgM memorySialyl-LacNAcNeu5Acα2-6[Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3)2β>10000.3912.74 ADI-47063IgG memoryLactose/Lewis AGalβ1–4Glcβ>10000.008.76 ADI-47227LLPCSLeC/GD3(9-OAc)Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ>10000.049.25 ADI-47299LLPCMUC4 glycopeptideTS"
https://openalex.org/W4295009357,"The internalization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can be regulated by PKC. However, most tools available to study the contribution of PKC isozymes have considerable limitations, including a lack of selectivity. In this study, we generated and characterized human embryonic kidney 293A (HEK293A) cell lines devoid of conventional or novel PKC isozymes (ΔcPKC and ΔnPKC) and employ these to investigate the contribution of PKC isozymes in the internalization of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5). Direct activation of PKC and mutation of rat mGlu5a Ser901, a PKC-dependent phosphorylation site in the receptor C-tail, both showed that PKC isozymes facilitate approximately 40% of the receptor internalization. Nonetheless, we determined that mGlu5a internalization was not altered upon the loss of cPKCs or nPKCs. This indicates that isozymes from both classes are involved, compensate for the absence of the other class, and thus fulfill dispensable functions. Additionally, using the Gαq/11 inhibitor YM-254890, GPCR kinase 2 and 3 (GRK2 and GRK3) KO cells, and a receptor containing a mutated putative adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) interaction motif, we demonstrate that internalization of rat mGlu5a is mediated by Gαq/11 proteins (77% of the response), GRK2 (27%), and AP-2 (29%), but not GRK3. Our PKC KO cell lines expand the repertoire of KO HEK293A cell lines available to research GPCR pharmacology. Moreover, since pharmacological tools to study PKC isozymes generally lack specificity and/or potency, we present the PKC KO cell lines as more specific research tools to investigate PKC-mediated aspects of cell biology."

We envision it to serve as a new benchmark dataset for performance evaluations of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) and Translation (CSLT) tasks. The proposed FluentSigners-50 dataset consists of 173 sentences performed by 50 KRSL signers resulting in 43,250 video samples. Dataset contributors recorded videos in real-life settings on a wide variety of backgrounds using various devices such as smartphones and web cameras. Therefore, distance to the camera, camera angles and aspect ratio, video quality, and frame rates varied for each dataset contributor. Additionally, the proposed dataset contains a high degree of linguistic and inter-signer variability and thus is a better training set for recognizing a real-life sign language. FluentSigners-50 baseline is established using two state-of-the-art methods, Stochastic CSLR and TSPNet. To this end, we carefully prepared three benchmark train-test splits for models’ evaluations in terms of: signer independence , age independence , and unseen sentences .

https://openalex.org/W4295432911,"COVID-19 is a highly contagious infectious disease that emerged in 2019. This disease is causing devastating health, socio-economic, and economic crises. More specifically COVID-19 is affecting both the quality and length of human life. The overall health impact of this disease is measured by the disability-adjusted life years which is the sum of the life years lost due to disability (the effect on the health quality) and the years life lost due to premature death (effect on the length of life). The purpose of this review is to summarise DALYs-based health impact publications and produce compiled and informative literature that can aid the health regulators to make evidence-based decisions on mitigating COVID-19.The review will be conducted using the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The DALYs-based original observational and cross-sectional studies will be collected for assessing the health impact of COVID-19. Both the life quality and length impacts of COVID-19 will be reviewed. The life quality impact of COVID-19 will be measured using the life years lost due to disability (pre-recovery illness, pre-death illness, and post-acute consequences), and its impact on the length of life will be measured with years of life lost due to premature death (shortening of life expectancy). The combined health impact of COVID-19 on the quality and length of life will be measured in disability-adjusted life years.The impacts of COVID-19 on the two health outcomes (quality and length of life) will indicate the level of COVID-19 health burden. The increase or decrease of COVID-19 health impact might be due to the sample size differences of different studies and the omission of years lost due to post-acute consequences in some studies. After having a summarized systematic review health decision-makers will apply an impact-based response to COVID-19.Systematic review registration: This protocol is pre-registered in PROSPERO with the registration number CRD42022324931."
https://openalex.org/W4295453557,"Naja sumatrana and Naja kaouthia are medically important elapids species found in Southeast Asia. Snake bite envenoming caused by these species may lead to morbidity or mortality if not treated with the appropriate antivenom. In this study, the in vitro neurotoxic and myotoxic effects N. sumatrana and N. kaouthia venoms from Malaysian specimens were assessed and compared. In addition, the neutralizing capability of Cobra Antivenom (CAV), King Cobra Antivenom (KCAV) and Neuro Polyvalent Antivenom (NPAV) from Thailand were compared. Both venoms produced concentration-dependent neurotoxic and myotoxic effects in the chick biventer cervicis nerve-muscle preparation. Based on the time to cause 90% inhibition of twitches (i.e. t90) N. kaouthia venom displayed more potent neurotoxic and myotoxic effects than N. sumatrana venom. All three of the antivenoms significantly attenuated venom-induced twitch reduction of indirectly stimulated tissues when added prior to venom. When added after N. sumatrana venom, at the t90 time point, CAV and NPAV partially restored the twitch height but has no significant effect on the reduction in twitch height caused by N. kaouthia venom. The addition of KCAV, at the t90 time point, did not reverse the attenuation of indirectly stimulated twitches caused by either venom. In addition, none of the antivenoms, when added prior to venom, prevented attenuation of directly stimulated twitches. Differences in the capability of antivenoms, especially NPAV and CAV, to reverse neurotoxicity and myotoxicity indicate that there is a need to isolate and characterize neurotoxins and myotoxins from Malaysian N. kaouthia and N. sumatrana venoms to improve neutralization capability of the antivenoms."
https://openalex.org/W4295477170,"Current veterinary communication skills training often focuses on the strategies necessary to successfully transfer information and promote shared decision making rather than inspiring client motivation to engage in behaviour change(s). One evidence-based communication methodology with a specific focus on enhancing conversations about change is Motivational Interviewing (MI), which is perceived by veterinarians to be highly relevant to their profession. We examined whether veterinarians who experienced brief (4-5 hours) MI training (BMIT) were able to change their communication behaviours to be more MI consistent. Fourteen veterinarians recorded 31 veterinary herd health consultations before (n = 15) and after (n = 16) BMIT to allow pre-post intervention analysis of veterinarian and farmer verbal behaviour. Additionally, using a sequential linguistic analysis of 3885 veterinarian-farmer communication events within these consultations, the influence of veterinarians' verbal behaviours on farmers' response language was explored. Analysis of veterinary consultations undertaken before and after BMIT revealed that veterinarians changed their communication style to be more consistent with the MI methodology, including more use of reflection statements, a more empathic and partnership-oriented consultation style and greater emphasis on clients' own language in favour of change goals. In response, farmers contributed more to the conversation and discussed more herd health-related changes. Sequential linguistic analysis suggested that following a veterinarian emphasising something positive about the farmer (e.g. efforts, strengths), seeking collaboration or emphasising farmer choice, farmers were subsequently more likely to express arguments in favour of change ('Change Talk'), especially phrases indicative of commitment. This study offers the first evidence of the potential value of a BMIT experience to enhance veterinary communication skills, although conscious and disciplined use of MI principles, strategies and Spirit-an ethos of compassion, acceptance, partnership and evocation-requires longer and more complex training. Further studies examining the longevity and consistency of these verbal behaviour changes following BMIT are required."
https://openalex.org/W4295485605,"Cervical cancer is an important public health problem in Ethiopia. However, the disease is not well characterized and studied in various parts of the country. This study was designed to describe the histopathological profile of cervical biopsies and to identify risk factors associated with high-grade cervical lesions and cancer (CIN2+C).A cross-sectional study was conducted at Felege Hiwot Compressive Specialized Hospital (FHCSH) between 1 March 2019 and 30 October 2021. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on the participants' demographic, reproductive and gynecologic history. From women presented with different degrees of cervical lesions, a senior gynecologist collected cervical swabs using (Digene HC2 DNA collection device: Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for detection of high-risk Human papillomaviruses (HR-HPV) and punch biopsy for histopathological examinations. HR-HPVs were detected using the Abbott Alinity m system following the manufacturer protocol at the Institute of Virology, Leipzig University Hospital, Germany. Collected data entered and analyzed using SPSS version 25. A logistic regression model was used for both bivariable & multivariable analysis in order to determine the association between independent variables and CIN2+C. Statistical significance was set at a p-value <0.05.In this study, 335 women were included; the mean age was at 46.5±11.4 years. Most were living in rural settings, 221(66%) and had no formal education, 259 (77.3%). More than half of the participants, 193(57.6%) were unaware of cervical cancer. The prevalence of HIV infection and previous history of cervical screening were 44(13.1%) and 93(27.8%), respectively. HR-HPVs were detected in 178(54.3%) of the participants. The majority of biopsies, 140(41.8%; 95%CI: 36.6-47.1%), were diagnosed as cervical carcinoma. Normal histology, cervicitis, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-1, CIN-2, and CIN-3 accounted for 74(22.1%), 30(9.0%), 40(11.9%), 12(3.6%), and 12(3.6%), respectively. High-grade lesions and cancer (CIN2+C) together accounted 164(49.0%; 95%CI: 43.6-54.2). Cervical cancer increased steadily with the age of the participants (p<0.001) in which women above the age of fifty were approximately four times more likely to develop CIN2+C than the younger ones (AOR: 3.73; 95%CI: 1.80-7.82; p<0.001). Likewise, no screening history in the last five years (AOR: 2.03; 95%CI: 1.05-3.92; p = 0.035) and being infected with HR-HPVs (AOR: 14.23; 95%CI: 7.9-25.64; p<0.001) were found significantly associated with CIN2+C.The findings of this study revealed that cervical cancer continues to be an important women's health challenge in northwest Ethiopia. Postmenopausal women, who had no screening history within a five-year period and those women who tested positive for HR-HPV need special attention. It is important to increase the awareness of women about cervical cancer and actions for early detection of precancerous lesions should be expanded."
https://openalex.org/W4295498949,"In order to move towards the elimination and eradication of malaria in the world, the development of vaccines is inevitable. Many modern vaccines are based on recombinant technology; however, they may not provide a fully protective, long-lasting immune response. One of the strategies to improve recombinant vaccines is designing the nanovaccines such as self-assembling protein nanoparticles (SAPNs). Hence, the presentation of epitopes in a repeat array and correct conformation should be considered. P. falciparum generative cell-specific 1 (PfGCS1) is a main transmission-blocking vaccine candidate with two highly conserved fragments, HAP2-GCS1 and cd loop, inducing partial malaria transmission inhibitory antibodies. Therefore, to design an effective malaria vaccine, we used cd loop and HAP2-GCS1 fragments at the amino and carboxy terminuses of the SAPN-forming amino acid sequence, respectively.The SAPN monomer (PfGCS1-SAPN) sequence was designed, and the three-dimensional (3D) structure was predicted. The result of this prediction ensured the presence of antigens on the SAPN surface. Then the accuracy of the predicted 3D structure and its stability were confirmed by 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The designed SAPN substructure sequence was synthesized, cloned, and expressed in Escherichia coli. With a gradual decrease in urea concentration in dialysis solutions, the purified proteins progressed to the final desired structure of the SAPN, which then was confirmed by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) tests. According to the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), antigenic determinants were presented on the SAPN surface and interacted with antibodies in the serum of malaria patients.Our results show that the SAPN formed by PfGCS1-SAPN has produced the correct shape and size, and the antigenic determinants are presented on the surface of the SAPN, which indicates that the designed SAPN has great potential to be used in the future as a malaria vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W4295512206,"A birth plan (BP) is a written document in which the pregnant woman explains her wishes and expectations about childbirth to the health professionals and aims to facilitate her decision-making. Midwives' support to women during the development of the BP is essential, but it's unknown if shared decision making (SDM) is effective in birth plan counselling. We hypothesized that women who receive counselling based on SDM during their pregnancy are more likely to present their BP to the hospital, more satisfied with the childbirth experience, and have better obstetric outcomes than women who receive standard counselling. We also aimed to identify if women who presented BP to the hospital have better obstetric outcomes and more satisfied with the childbirth experience.This was a randomised cluster trial involving four Primary Care Units. Midwives provided BP counselling based on SDM to the women in the intervention group (IG) during their pregnancy, along with a leaflet with evidence-based recommendations. Women in the control group (CG) only received the standard birth plan counselling from midwives. The primary outcomes were birth plan presentation to the hospital, obstetrics outcomes and satisfaction with childbirth experience. The Mackey Satisfaction with Childbirth Scale (MCSRS) was used to measure childbirth satisfaction.A total of 461 (95.5%) pregnant women received BP counselling (IG n = 214 and CG n = 247). Fewer women in the intervention group presented their BP to the hospital compared to those in the control group (57.8% vs 75.1%; p <0.001). Mean satisfaction with childbirth experience was high in the IG as well as the CG: 150.2 (SD:22.6) vs. 153.4 (SD:21.8); p = 0.224). The information received about childbirth during pregnancy was high in both groups (95.1% vs 94.8%; p = 1.0). Fewer women in the IG used analgesia epidural compared to those in the CG (84.7% vs 91.7%; p = 0.034); women who combined non-pharmacological and pharmacological methods for pain relief were more in number in the IG (48.9% vs 29.5%; p = 0.001) and women who began breastfeeding in the delivery room were more in number in the IG (83.9% vs 66.3%; p = 0.001). Women who presented their BP had a greater probability of using combined non-pharmacological and pharmacological methods for pain relief aOR = 2.06 (95% CI: 1.30-4.30) and early skin-to-skin contact aOR = 2.08 (95% CI: 1.07-4.04).This counselling intervention was not effective to increase the presentation of the BP to the hospital and women's satisfaction with childbirth; however, it was related to a lower usage of analgesia epidural, a higher combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods for pain relief and the initiation of breastfeeding in the delivery room. Presenting the BP to the hospital increased the likelihood of using pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods for pain relief, and early skin-to-skin contact."
https://openalex.org/W4280611755,"When comparing the performance of multi-armed bandit algorithms, the potential impact of missing data is often overlooked. In practice, it also affects their implementation where the simplest approach to overcome this is to continue to sample according to the original bandit algorithm, ignoring missing outcomes. We investigate the impact on performance of this approach to deal with missing data for several bandit algorithms through an extensive simulation study assuming the rewards are missing at random. We focus on two-armed bandit algorithms with binary outcomes in the context of patient allocation for clinical trials with relatively small sample sizes. However, our results apply to other applications of bandit algorithms where missing data is expected to occur. We assess the resulting operating characteristics, including the expected reward. Different probabilities of missingness in both arms are considered. The key finding of our work is that when using the simplest strategy of ignoring missing data, the impact on the expected performance of multi-armed bandit strategies varies according to the way these strategies balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Algorithms that are geared towards exploration continue to assign samples to the arm with more missing responses (which being perceived as the arm with less observed information is deemed more appealing by the algorithm than it would otherwise be). In contrast, algorithms that are geared towards exploitation would rapidly assign a high value to samples from the arms with a current high mean irrespective of the level observations per arm. Furthermore, for algorithms focusing more on exploration, we illustrate that the problem of missing responses can be alleviated using a simple mean imputation approach."
https://openalex.org/W4295009328,"Among voltage-gated potassium channel (KV) isoforms, KV1.6 is one of the most widespread in the nervous system. However, there are little data concerning its physiological significance, in part due to the scarcity of specific ligands. The known high-affinity ligands of KV1.6 lack selectivity, and conversely, its selective ligands show low affinity. Here, we present a designer peptide with both high affinity and selectivity to KV1.6. Previously, we have demonstrated that KV isoform-selective peptides can be constructed based on the simplistic α-hairpinin scaffold, and we obtained a number of artificial Tk-hefu peptides showing selective blockage of KV1.3 in the submicromolar range. We have now proposed amino acid substitutions to enhance their activity. As a result, we have been able to produce Tk-hefu-11 that shows an EC50 of ≈70 nM against KV1.3. Quite surprisingly, Tk-hefu-11 turns out to block KV1.6 with even higher potency, presenting an EC50 of ≈10 nM. Furthermore, we have solved the peptide structure and used molecular dynamics to investigate the determinants of selective interactions between artificial α-hairpinins and KV channels to explain the dramatic increase in KV1.6 affinity. Since KV1.3 is not highly expressed in the nervous system, we hope that Tk-hefu-11 will be useful in studies of KV1.6 and its functions."
https://openalex.org/W4295009582,"Intracellular vesicle fusion requires the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) and their cognate Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins. How SM proteins act in concert with trans-SNARE complexes to promote membrane fusion remains incompletely understood. Munc18c, a broadly distributed SM protein, selectively regulates multiple exocytotic pathways, including GLUT4 exocytosis. Here, using an in vitro reconstituted system, we discovered a SNARE-like peptide (SLP), conserved in Munc18-1 of synaptic exocytosis, is crucial to the stimulatory activity of Munc18c in vesicle fusion. The direct stimulation of the SNARE-mediated fusion reaction by SLP further supported the essential role of this fragment. Interestingly, we found SLP strongly accelerates the membrane fusion rate when anchored to the target membrane but not the vesicle membrane, suggesting it primarily interacts with t-SNAREs in cis to drive fusion. Furthermore, we determined the SLP fragment is competitive with the full-length Munc18c protein and specific to the cognate v-SNARE isoforms, supporting how it could resemble Munc18c's activity in membrane fusion. Together, our findings demonstrate that Munc18c facilitates SNARE-dependent membrane fusion through SLP, revealing that the t-SNARE-SLP binding mode might be a conserved mechanism for the stimulatory function of SM proteins in vesicle fusion."
https://openalex.org/W4295196946,"N-glycosylation is an essential eukaryotic posttranslational modification that affects various glycoprotein properties, including folding, solubility, protein-protein interactions, and half-life. N-glycans are processed in the secretory pathway to form varied ensembles of structures, and diversity at a single site on a glycoprotein is termed 'microheterogeneity'. To understand the factors that influence glycan microheterogeneity, we hypothesized that local steric and electrostatic factors surrounding each site influence glycan availability for enzymatic modification. We tested this hypothesis via expression of reporter N-linked glycoproteins in N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase MGAT1-null HEK293 cells to produce immature Man5GlcNAc2 glycoforms (38 glycan sites total). These glycoproteins were then sequentially modified in vitro from high mannose to hybrid and on to biantennary, core-fucosylated, complex structures by a panel of N-glycosylation enzymes, and each reaction time course was quantified by LC-MS/MS. Substantial differences in rates of in vitro enzymatic modification were observed between glycan sites on the same protein, and differences in modification rates varied depending on the glycoenzyme being evaluated. In comparison, proteolytic digestion of the reporters prior to N-glycan processing eliminated differences in in vitro enzymatic modification. Furthermore, comparison of in vitro rates of enzymatic modification with the glycan structures found on the mature reporters expressed in WT cells correlated well with the enzymatic bottlenecks observed in vivo. These data suggest higher order local structures surrounding each glycosylation site contribute to the efficiency of modification both in vitro and in vivo to establish the spectrum of microheterogeneity in N-linked glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W4295249407,"Ischemic stroke is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality. The β-1, 3-galactosyltransferase 2 (B3galt2), a member of β-1, 3-galactosyltransferase family, is playing a vital role in the pathological process of cerebral ischemic injury, but its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we examined the involvement of oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the neuroprotective effect of B3galt2. Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury was simulated in a mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Recombinant human B3galt2 (rh-B3galt2) was administered intranasally 1 h post MCAO, and TGF-β1-siRNA was administered intracerebroventricularly 24 h before MCAO. Outcome measures included brain infarct volume, neurological function, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, neuronal apoptosis, oxidative stress, and the inflammatory response. First, we found that rh-B3galt2 significantly alleviated brain infarct volume and BBB permeability, improved neurological function, and attenuated I/R-induced neuron apoptosis and oxidative stress. Furthermore, rh-B3galt2 attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokines, NF-κB, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, and inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Finally, inhibition of TGF-β1 by TGF-β1-siRNA abolished the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of rh-B3galt2 in mice after I/R. Collectively, our study demonstrated that rh-B3galt2 exerts neuroprotective effects by regulating cerebral ischemia-induced oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome, which is mainly dependent on the heightening of the TGF-β1 pathway. Thus, B3galt2 might be considered a new therapeutic target for ischemic stroke treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4295280955,"The kidneys are radiosensitive and dose-limiting organs for radiotherapy (RT) targeting abdominal and paraspinal tumors. Excessive radiation doses to the kidneys ultimately lead to radiation nephropathy. Our prior work unmasked a novel role for the lipid-modifying enzyme, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3b (SMPDL3b), in regulating the response of renal podocytes to radiation injury. In this study, we investigated the role of SMPDL3b in DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair in vitro and in vivo. We assessed the kinetics of DSBs recognition and repair along with the ATM pathway and nuclear sphingolipid metabolism in wild-type (WT) and SMPDL3b overexpressing (OE) human podocytes. We also assessed the extent of DNA damage repair in SMPDL3b knock-down (KD) human podocytes, and C57BL6 WT and podocyte-specific SMPDL3b-knock out (KO) mice after radiation injury. We found that SMPDL3b overexpression enhanced DSBs recognition and repair through modulating ATM nuclear shuttling. OE podocytes were protected against radiation-induced apoptosis by increasing the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 and attenuating subsequent caspase-3 cleavage. SMPDL3b overexpression prevented radiation-induced alterations in nuclear ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) and ceramide levels. Interestingly, exogenous C1P pretreatment radiosensitized OE podocytes by delaying ATM nuclear foci formation and DSBs repair. On the other hand, SMPDL3b knock-down, in vitro and in vivo, induced a significant delay in DSBs repair. Additionally, increased activation of apoptosis was induced in podocytes of SMPDL3b-KO mice compared to WT mice at 24 h post-irradiation. Together, our results unravel a novel role for SMPDL3b in radiation-induced DNA damage response. The current work suggests that SMPDL3b modulates nuclear sphingolipid metabolism, ATM nuclear shuttling, and DSBs repair."
https://openalex.org/W4295429919,"Intense transmission of syphilis has emerged in some Canadian Arctic communities despite screening and prevention efforts. The remoteness of most communities and limited diagnostic infrastructure yield long delays (≥14 days) between screening and treatment of cases. These hamper syphilis control efforts and may contribute to sustained transmission. Syphilis rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been developed to make screening more accessible and to inform clinical decision-making within the same clinical encounter. These RDTs have been successfully deployed in several countries, but not yet in Canada.We describe the methodology of the ""Stopping Syphilis Transmission in Arctic Communities Through Rapid Diagnostic Testing"" (STAR) study, wherein the clinical and epidemiological impact of deploying a dual syphilis RDT in the context of ongoing transmission in Nunavut and Nunavik will be evaluated. In this prospective multisite field evaluation, sexually active individuals aged ≥14 years at risk for syphilis will be offered screening by an RDT at the point-of-care by non-laboratory trained registered nurses. Whole blood and serum specimens will be concurrently collected, when feasible, for rapid testing with an RDT containing both treponemal and non-treponemal components (Chembio DPP® Syphilis Screen & Confirm) and compared to laboratory-based reference testing according to a reverse sequence algorithm. The diagnostic accuracy of the RDT, using both whole blood and centrifuged serum specimens, will be validated under real-world conditions in remote Northern settings, outside of specialized laboratories. Additionally, screening-to-treatment time, case detection rates, and the number of infectious contacts averted by using the RDT relative to reference testing will be estimated. The impact of both diagnostic approaches on syphilis transmission dynamics will also be modeled.This study will provide much needed evidence for strengthening rapid responses to emerging syphilis outbreaks in remote Arctic regions, by supplementing traditional diagnostic strategies with an RDT to rapidly triage patients likely in need of treatment. These results will also inform the development and tailoring of future diagnostic strategies and public health responses to emerging outbreaks in the North."

The nasal mucosal environment which consists of lipids, mucosal immune cells, and nasal proteome, has been largely neglected but later revealed to have critical role combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. We present a bottom-up proteomics investigation of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the nasopharyngeal environment, featuring a noninvasive approach using proteins in nasopharyngeal swabs collected from groups of 76 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 76 negative patients. Results showed that 31 significantly down-regulated and 6 up-regulated proteins were identified ( p &lt; 0.05, log 2 FC &gt; 1.3) in SARS-CoV-2 positive patient samples as compared to the negatives; these proteins carry potential value as markers for the early detection of COVID-19, disease monitoring, as well as be drug targets. The down-regulation of coagulation factor 5 indicates a thrombotic abnormality in COVID-19 patients and the decreased IgG4 suggests an abnormal immune response at the point of entry in human nasopharyngeal environment, which is in consistent with KEGG and GO pathway analysis. Our study also demonstrated that mass spectrometry proteomics analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs can be used as a powerful early approach to evaluate host response to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W4295484657,"Administrative division is an important resource to promote the urbanization process and economic growth in China. As an important way of urban spatial expansion, the effect of the removal of counties (county-level cities) into municipal districts(RCD) on economic growth remains to be empirically tested. In this paper, the panel data at the county level from 1998 to 2016 and the differential method were selected to study this problem. The results show that, during the study period, the RCD significantly promoted the economic growth of Chinese cities. The effect of removing counties (county-level cities) from large cities and megacities to set up districts is obviously better than that of small and medium-sized cities. In small and medium-sized cities with small urban permanent population, the RCD has obvious negative impact on economic development. The effect of county (county-level city) reform in eastern and central regions is more significant, while the effect of policy in western and northeast regions is not significant. When the development intensity of the municipal district is between 15%-20%, the effect of the RCD is relatively good, and the administrative division adjustment of the municipal district has a certain optimal window period."
https://openalex.org/W4295491500,"Manufacturing enterprises accumulate numerous manufacturing instances as they run and develop. Being able to excavate and apply the instance resources reasonably is one of the most effective approaches to improve manufacturing and support innovation. A novel framework for the discovery and reuse of typical process routes driven by symbolic entropy and intelligent optimisation algorithm so as to scientifically determine reuse objects and raise the reuse flexibility is proposed in this paper. A similarity measurement method of machining process routes based on symbolic entropy is developed in this framework. Subsequently, a typical process route discovery method based on the ant colony clustering model and similarity measurement is devised, and two reuse approaches based on the typical process route are analysed. Finally, three case studies are rendered. These case studies cover the aspects of similarity analysis, mining, and reuse of manufacturing instances, which systematically explains the whole procedure of discovery and reuse based on typical process route. The case studies show that (i) the similarity measurement method based on symbolic entropy can accurately evaluate the similarity among ten machining process routes, (ii) ant colony clustering model can realize adaptive clustering for these ten process routes, and (iii) indirect reuse approach for the typical process route can support the generation of new machining plan effectively. This reveal that the proposed framework comprehensively considers various aspects of retrieval and reuse of manufacturing instances, which can effectively support process instance reuse. Can better support process instance reuse."
https://openalex.org/W4295872867,"Although miR-7 suppresses the initiation and progression in cancers, little is known about its role in prostate cancer, especially in transgenic mouse models. In present study, we found that expression of miR-7, regulated by p53, was lower in prostate cancer tissues, and miR-7 overexpression significantly mitigated prostate cancer cells growth both in vitro, in organoids and in vivo regardless of p53 status. After we generated miR-7 overexpression transgenic mice and miR-7+/TRAMP mice, we found that transgenic overexpression of miR-7 in mice is safe and miR-7+/TRAMP mice have a preferred overall survival. Moreover, in vivo treatment of miR-7 inhibited subcutaneous tumour growth in mice and prolonged the survival of mice harboring prostate cancer lung metastasis when co-injection with PD-1 antibody. In addition, miR-7 downregulated glycolysis of prostate cancer cells by inhibiting several key pathways including HIF-1α, and subsequently remodeled acidic tumour microenvironment, PanKLa level and T cell infiltration. In summary, our findings highlighted a promising target for development of miRNA-based therapeutics for prostate cancer patients regardless of p53 status."
https://openalex.org/W4296276464,"Metastasis of breast cancer represents the major reason for its poor prognosis, leading to high mortality. In breast cancer, a tumor suppressor gene TP53 is commonly mutated. TP53 mutation leads to an altered expression of various genes, an event that is associated with aggressive tumor and is a strong independent marker for survival. In this study, we identified a novel p53 target gene, immunoglobulin superfamily 9 (IGSF9). IGSF9 is generally down-regulated in breast cancer tissues. Loss of IGSF9 is associated with frequent metastasis and poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. Wild-type p53, but not R175H mutant, trans-activates the transcription of IGSF9 via binding to its promoter (-137 to -131 bp), inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), consequently the inhibition of breast cancer cells migration and invasion. IGSF9 interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and inhibits FAK/AKT signaling activity. PND1186, FAK inhibitor, inhibits breast cancer metastasis induced by IGSF9 knockdown in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, IGSF9 is trans-activated by p53 and inhibits breast cancer metastasis by modulating FAK/AKT signaling pathway. IGSF9 could serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4295439732,"The HEAT domains are a family of helical hairpin repeat domains, composed of four or more hairpins. HEAT is derived from the names of four family members: huntingtin, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 3 (eEF3), protein phosphatase 2 regulatory A subunit (PP2A), and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). HEAT domain-containing proteins play roles in a wide range of cellular processes, such as protein synthesis, nuclear transport and metabolism, and cell signaling. The PCI domains are a related group of helical hairpin domains, with a ""winged-helix"" (WH) subdomain at their C-terminus, which is responsible for multi-subunit complex formation with other PCI domains. The name is derived from the complexes, where these domains are found: the 26S Proteasome ""lid"" regulatory subcomplex, the COP9 signalosome (CSN), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3). We noted that in structure similarity searches using HEAT domains, sometimes PCI domains appeared in the search results ahead of other HEAT domains, which indicated that the PCI domains could be members of the HEAT domain family, and not a related but separate group, as currently thought. Here, we report extensive structure similarity analysis of HEAT and PCI domains, both within and between the two groups of proteins. We present evidence that the PCI domains as a group have greater structural similarity with individual groups of HEAT domains than some of the HEAT domain groups have among each other. Therefore, our results indicate that the PCI domains have evolved from a HEAT domain that acquired a WH subdomain. The WH subdomain in turn mediated self-association into a multi-subunit complex, which eventually evolved into the common ancestor of the Proteasome lid/CSN/eIF3."

Active COVID-19 is associated with unrestrained secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and imbalances in haematological profile including anaemia, leukocytosis and thrombocytopaenia. However, the haematological profile and immune status following recovery from COVID-19 has not been recognized. We evaluated the immunohaematological profile among COVID-19 patients with active infection, recovered cases and unexposed healthy individuals in the Ashanti region of Ghana.A total of 95 adult participants, consisting of 35 positive, 30 recovered and 30 unexposed COVID-19 negative individuals confirmed by RT-PCR were recruited for the study. All the patients had the complete blood count performed using the haematological analyzer Sysmex XN-1500. Their plasma cytokine levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) were analysed using ELISA. Statistical analyses were performed on R statistical software.The Patients with COVID-19 active infection had significantly higher levels of IL10 (181±6.14 pg/mL vs 155.00±14.32 pg/mL vs 158.80±11.70 pg/mL, p = 0.038), WBC count (5.5±0.4 x109 /L vs 4.5±0.6 x109 /L vs 3.8±0.5, p < 0.0001) and percentage basophil (1.8±0.1% vs 0.8±0.3% vs 0.7±0.2%, p = 0.0040) but significantly lower levels of IFN-γ (110.10±9.52 pg/mL vs 142.80±5.46 pg/mL vs 140.80±6.39 pg/mL, p = 0.021), haematocrit (24.1±3.7% vs 38.3± 3.0% vs 38.5±2.2%, p < 0.0001), haemoglobin concentration (9.4±0.1g/dl vs 12.5± 5.0g/dl vs 12.7±0.8, p < 0.0001) and MPV (9.8±0.2fL vs 11.1±0.5fL vs 11.6±0.3fL, p < 0.0001) compared to recovered and unexposed controls respectively.

Clinicaltrials.gov was used to identify the beginning of each research trajectory that resulted in a secondary FDA approval. Each trajectory was classified as pre- or post-approval depending on if it was initiated before or after initial drug licensure. Clinical impact was assessed by comparing secondary approvals and NCCN off-label recommendations deriving from pre- vs. post-approval trajectories, pooled effect sizes, incidence, and level of evidence.We identified 77 broad secondary approvals, 60 of which had at least 6 years follow-up. Of these, 9 (15%) resulted from post-approval trajectories, a proportion that is significantly lower than would be expected if the timing of research didn't impact approval (McNemar's test p = 0.001). Compared to pre-approval trajectories, approvals resulting from post-approval trajectories were for cancers with lower mean incidence (6.11 vs 14.83, p = 0.006) and were based on pivotal trials with smaller pooled effect sizes (0.69 vs 0.57, p = 0.02) that were less likely to be randomized (38.5% vs 64.1%, p = 0.145). We identified 69 NCCN off-label recommendations. The proportion stemming from post-approval trajectories was similar to that for pre-approval (56.5% vs. 43.5%). However, recommendations from post-approval trajectories were significantly more likely to involve rare diseases (76.7% vs 51.4%, p = 0.019) and nonsignificantly less likely to be based on level 1 evidence (11.6% vs 22.9%, p = 0.309).Secondary FDA approvals are less likely to result from post-approval trajectories and tend to be less impactful compared to approvals originating from research started before first FDA licensure. However, post-approval trajectories may be as likely to lead to NCCN recommendations for off-label use. Limitations of this work include our use of indirect measures of impact and limited follow-up time for trajectories. Our study protocol was pre-registered (https://osf.io/5g3jw/)."
https://openalex.org/W4295491959,"The present study involved an extra-cultural adaptation and validation of questionnaire regarding online teaching (QOT) to know faculty perception, attitude and experiences of online teaching. Cronbach’s alpha was determined for assessing internal reliability of QOT and found to be 0.886, confirmed that the scale have good reliability. Factor Analysis of the scale (Principal Component Analysis) was used to examine factor structure and then trailed by varimax rotation. The items were allocated four sub scales. A survey technique was used for the validation of QOT and the survey was conducted during September-December’ 2020 in private and public universities of Karachi to determine the pharmacy faculty’s perception and experience regarding online teaching. Approximately 35% responded that “It is very easy to prepare and deliver an online course” and 45% opined that “The universities offering Pharm.D should adopt the use of e-learning for teaching in future to complement traditional teaching”. Majority of the faculty were in favor of starting online teaching during pandemic to complete semester on time (72%). However, in-campus courses contribute more to students’ learning than online courses in pharmaceutical sciences (65.5%). The present study summarizes that academic staff did opt online teaching over one-to-one teaching in the lock down situation during Covid-19 pandemic however, they agreed not to replace traditional teaching to online teaching. Teachers recognized some difficulties and challenges during online teaching including difficulty in preparing lecture for online teaching than traditional classroom teaching, shortage of long time training sessions. Female teachers were inclined to online teaching than male and lecturers tend to prefer online teaching compared to senior teachers. Universities and administration should take imperative acts for improving online teaching for better learning during lock down or any other situation where social distancing is required."

In this paper, from the perspective of sustainable development, data of 104 cities in China's Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) from 2004 to 2019 are selected, and the urban resource consumption index and urban pollutant emission index are synthesized as new input-output indicators using the Time Series Global Principal Component Analysis (GPCA), combined with the Global Malmquist-Luenberger (GML) Index Model, Standard Deviation Ellipse (SDE) Model to measure the total factor productivity index of urban economic development in China's YREB and analyze its spatial and temporal evolution. The results show that from 2004 to 2019, the total factor productivity index of urban economic development in China's YREB showed an overall fluctuating upward trend with an average annual growth of 5.8%, and the analysis by decomposing indicators shows that the growth of total factor productivity of urban economic development in China's YREB is mainly influenced by the growth of technological progress. Meanwhile, there are obvious regional differences in the efficiency of urban economic development in China's YREB, with the largest difference in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the second largest in the upper reaches, and the smallest in the lower reaches. From 2004 to 2019, the efficiency center of gravity of urban economic development efficiency in the YREB has always been located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River region. The spatial distribution pattern of urban economic development efficiency in the YREB is dominated by the northeast-southwest direction and tends to be concentrated in the study time period."
https://openalex.org/W4295495816,"To investigate the molecular pathological mechanisms of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and elucidate the effects of acupuncture on IBS-D colonic mucosa protein abundance in rats, a label-free high-throughput liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based proteomics analysis was used to survey the global changes of colonic mucosa proteins between different groups. Sixteen Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats were randomly divided into four groups: the control group (C); the IBS-D model group (M); the syndrome differentiation acupuncture group (SD) and the traditional acupuncture group (T). IBS-D model rats were obtained using the CAS (chronic acute combining stress model) method. Comparative bioinformatics analysis of the proteomic data was analyzed using MaxQuant software, Perseus software, online tools DAVID, VENNY and STRING. Functional enrichment and network analyses revealed a close relationship between IBS-D and several biological processes including energy metabolism, muscular excitation/contraction, and both traditional acupuncture and syndrome differentiation acupuncture can reverse the impairments of normal energy metabolism. Moreover, the syndrome differentiation acupuncture can regulate the protein cluster relating inflammation, wound repair and cell protection against oxidative stress which is associated with acupuncture analgesic effect. Differentially expressed proteins Atp5a1 and Bpnt1 were selected as representative proteins and subjected to western blotting. In conclusion, our study provides further insight into the pathological and molecular mechanisms of IBS-D and acupuncture treatments, and serves as an experimental basis for clinical applications."

https://openalex.org/W4295519665,"Challenges exist in the diagnosis and management of autoimmune rheumatic diseases in low and middle income countries due to factors, such as poverty and under-resourced healthcare infrastructure. Furthermore, other contributory factors such as societal, cultural and religious practices influence health seeking behaviour which has a bearing on access and delivery of healthcare.To examine the health seeking behaviour and referral patterns of Ghanaian patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases and assess the associated factors that influence these.A cross-sectional study using an explanatory sequential mixed method design was carried out in a Rheumatology clinic at a national referral centre. 110 participants were purposively recruited for the quantitative phase. The qualitative phase comprised 10 participants for in-depth interviews and 10 participants for a focus group discussion. Analysis using descriptive statistics, t-tests and logistic regression models were performed. Transcripts generated from the interviews and focused group discussion were analysed using thematic analysis.Median duration from onset of symptoms until seeking help was 1 week (IQR = 12); from seeking help until obtaining a final diagnosis was 12 months (IQR = 33). Multiple factors determined the choice of first facility visited, X2 (12, N = 107) = 32.29, p = .001. Only twenty-one participants (19.6%) had knowledge of their disease prior to diagnosis. Education predicted prior knowledge [OR = 2.6 (95% CI = .66-10.12), p < .021]. Unemployed participants had increased odds of seeking help after a month compared to those who were employed [Odds ratio = 2.60 (95% CI = 1.14-5.90), p = .02]. Knowledge of autoimmune rheumatic diseases was low with multiple causative factors such as biomedical, environmental and spiritual causes determining where patients accessed care. Forty (36.4%) participants utilised complementary and alternative treatment options.We observed that knowledge about autoimmune rheumatic diseases among Ghanaian patients was low. Patients sought help from numerous medical facilities, traditional healers and prayer camps often contributing to a delay in diagnosis for most patients. This was influenced by individual perceptions, cultural beliefs and socioeconomic status. Active awareness and educational programmes for the public and healthcare workers are required, as well as strategic planning to integrate the biomedical and traditional care services to enable earlier presentation, accurate diagnosis and better clinical outcomes for the patients."
