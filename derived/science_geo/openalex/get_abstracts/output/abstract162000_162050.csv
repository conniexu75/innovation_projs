https://openalex.org/W2081578928,"Clustering seems to be employed by many receptors for transmembrane signaling. Here, we show that acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)-released ceramide is essential for clustering of CD95.In vitro and in vivo, extracellularly orientated ceramide, released upon CD95-triggered translocation of ASM to the plasma membrane outer surface, enabled clustering of CD95 in sphingolipid-rich membrane rafts and apoptosis induction. Whereas ASM deficiency, destruction of rafts, or neutralization of surface ceramide prevented CD95 clustering and apoptosis, natural ceramide only rescued ASM-deficient cells. The data suggest CD95-mediated clustering by ceramide is prerequisite for signaling and death. Clustering seems to be employed by many receptors for transmembrane signaling.

Evidence suggests that many receptors aggregate in distinct cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains or rafts (6Simons K. Ikonen E.

Rafts seem to exist as preformed entities in the membrane of resting cells (13Pralle A. Keller P. Florin E.L. Simons K. Horber J.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar); whether receptor stimulation induces a biologically relevant modification of these rafts is unknown. Likewise, mechanisms mediating the trapping of activated receptor molecules within rafts require definition.In the present studies, we have investigated whether a hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide and, thus, a change in the composition of rafts contributes to clustering of receptor molecules. Ceramide is released by the activity of at least three forms of sphingomyelinases with an acidic, neutral, or basic pH optimum (14Gulbins E. Jekle A. Ferlinz K. Grassmé H. Lang F. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F605-F615PubMed Google Scholar). Of these enzymes only the acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is rapidly, i.e. within seconds, activated upon stimulation via e.g. CD95 or TNF and therefore, could release ceramide within the time frame of receptor clustering (15Cifone M.G.

Finally, at least for the p75NGF- or IL-1 receptor ceramide generation predominantly localizes to sphingolipid-rich rafts (21Bilderback T.R. Grigsby R.J. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Biol.

Translocated ASM localizes to sphingolipid-rich rafts and releases extracellularly orientated ceramide that mediates selective clustering of CD95 and constitutes an essential prerequisite for signaling.DISCUSSIONReceptor clustering appears to be critical for transmembrane signaling through many receptors. Our results provide insight into molecular mechanisms of the clustering process and indicate a novel mechanism for receptor clustering. The data identify ASM, translocated onto the surface of sphingolipid-rich rafts, as a key player in CD95 clustering and signaling. The experiments using P. aeruginosa-induced up-regulation of CD95 and CD95 ligand indicate the significance of ASM/ceramide-mediated clustering of CD95 for apoptosis even under (patho)physiological conditions. Our data suggest the following function of ASM/ceramide for CD95 clustering: Interaction of membrane-bound CD95 ligand with CD95 results in a transient and weak activation of a limited number of CD95 trimers or oligomers insufficient to trigger apoptosis but sufficient for ASM translocation to the outer membrane leaflet. The notion of a primary weak activation of CD95 is supported by the findings that mere trimerization of CD95 by its ligand is insufficient to induce apoptosis (28Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) and by our preliminary data showing a 50–100-fold reduction of caspase 8 activation in cells lacking ASM upon CD95 stimulation, an event restored by ASM transfection. Translocated ASM, now in the proximity of sphingomyelin that resides in the outer surface of mammalian membranes, will release ceramide. In model membrane systems, ceramide has the unique capacity to spontaneously self-aggregate into microdomains (29Huang H.W. Goldberg E.M. Zidovetzki R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1489-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Veiga M.P. Arrondo J.L. Goni F.M. Alonso A. Biophys.

If this event occurred in a preformed microdomain such as caveolae or caveolar-like domains, re-ordering of this domain into a signaling structure might ensue. In fact, a number of groups have now published data demonstrating that ASM functions in sphingolipid-enriched microdomains in various cell types (21Bilderback T.R. Grigsby R.J. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10922-10927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 22Liu P. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In addition, in model membranes ceramide-rich microdomains tend to fuse (32Holopainen J.M. Subramanian M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17562-17570Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and thus, ceramide might further trigger the fusion of rafts to larger platforms. This notion is supported by unpublished findings from our group that CD95 stimulation of NPDA cells expressing an inactive mutant of ASM induces translocation of this mutant protein onto multiple small spots on the cell surface, which fail to fuse into a large cluster. These platforms may finally interact with activated CD95 at the synapse between CD95 ligand and CD95, greatly increasing the stability of their interaction by (a) trapping and locking CD95 molecules within rafts, thus increasing the time of interaction with the ligand, (b) recruiting intracellular signaling molecules to CD95, (c) excluding inhibitory pathways, and/or (d) directly altering the affinity/avidity of CD95 for its ligand. As a result of receptor clustering, intracellular effector molecules mediating CD95 action are brought into close proximity, enabling their transactivation. Thus, e.g. CD95 clustering may concentrate caspase 8 molecules within a confined area amplifying local proteolysis, even if primarily only a few dispersed caspase 8 molecules were active. In accordance with that model, high overexpression of the TNF-R results in its spontaneous multimerization and apoptosis of the transfected cells (33Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I.

Chem. 1995; 270: 387-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar).In the present study, we employed two anti-ASM antibodies, a polyclonal goat and a monoclonal mouse antibody. Both antibodies were raised against the full-length human ASM protein. To assure that ASM and not a cross-reacting protein was being recognized at the cell surface upon CD95 ligation, we repeated our studies using cells transfected with a Myc- or VSV-tagged ASM construct (see Fig.2 D). The pattern of detection of transfected ASM with either anti-Myc 9E10 or anti-VSV P5D4 antibodies was identical to that detected using the anti-ASM antibodies. Further, lymphocytes derived from ASM knockout mice stained with either the goat or mouse anti-ASM antibodies failed to show a signal, supporting the specificity of these antibodies for ASM. 2E. Gulbins, unpublished observations. Finally, CD95 stimulation of NPDA cells expressing a mutated inactive ASM showed translocation of this protein to the cell surface but no clustering. Fluorescence microscopy studies on those NPDA cells similarly showed a dispersed surface pattern of translocated ASM suggesting that ASM detection by these antibodies is not restricted to aggregated ASM (data not shown).Cell surface ceramide was immunodetected using the anti-ceramide antibody 15B4 raised against C16-ceramide coupled to bovine serum albumin. Several lines of evidence attest to the specific binding of this antibody to ceramide. ELISA revealed that 15B4 binding to C16-ceramide is dose-dependent. 3R. Kolesnick, unpublished observations.Further, loading intact cells with C16-ceramide conferred strong antibody binding to the cell surface. In addition, the antibody does not significantly bind to unstimulated cells in FACS or fluorescence microscopy excluding a substantive reaction with cholesterol, sphingomyelin, or other phospholipids (see Fig. 2,E and F). ASM deficiency also abrogated antibody binding upon CD95 ligation suggesting that only lipids generated after ASM activation are detected. Finally, thin layer chromatography immunostaining of lipid extracts from CD95 stimulated JY cells showed that the antibody binds to a single band co-migrating with C16-ceramide, effectively excluding significant interaction with other lipids. Consistent with this observation, the antibody did not bind C16-dihydroceramide or sphingomyelin in immune thin layer chromatography.2In summary, our data provide evidence for a previously unreported biological function of ASM-released ceramide, i.e. the generation of receptor clusters, which constitute an important prerequisite for receptor signaling. Thus, the data may shed some light on modifications of rafts that trigger receptor clustering. Ceramide-mediated receptor clustering might be operational in many receptor systems explaining the diverse functions of ceramide ranging from induction of apoptosis to invasion of bacterial pathogens. Preliminary results from our group show that ASM and ceramide not only trigger clustering of CD95 and CD40, but may play a similar role in T-cell receptor/CD3, B-cell receptor or CD28 signaling. In addition, some pathogenic bacteria may employ ASM-mediated receptor clustering for invasion into mammalian cells. Thus, our data suggest sphingolipid-mediated clustering as a generic mechanism for transmembrane signal transmission.

In addition, the antibody does not significantly bind to unstimulated cells in FACS or fluorescence microscopy excluding a substantive reaction with cholesterol, sphingomyelin, or other phospholipids (see Fig. 2,E and F). ASM deficiency also abrogated antibody binding upon CD95 ligation suggesting that only lipids generated after ASM activation are detected. Finally, thin layer chromatography immunostaining of lipid extracts from CD95 stimulated JY cells showed that the antibody binds to a single band co-migrating with C16-ceramide, effectively excluding significant interaction with other lipids. Consistent with this observation, the antibody did not bind C16-dihydroceramide or sphingomyelin in immune thin layer chromatography.2In summary, our data provide evidence for a previously unreported biological function of ASM-released ceramide, i.e. the generation of receptor clusters, which constitute an important prerequisite for receptor signaling. Thus, the data may shed some light on modifications of rafts that trigger receptor clustering. Ceramide-mediated receptor clustering might be operational in many receptor systems explaining the diverse functions of ceramide ranging from induction of apoptosis to invasion of bacterial pathogens. Preliminary results from our group show that ASM and ceramide not only trigger clustering of CD95 and CD40, but may play a similar role in T-cell receptor/CD3, B-cell receptor or CD28 signaling. In addition, some pathogenic bacteria may employ ASM-mediated receptor clustering for invasion into mammalian cells. Thus, our data suggest sphingolipid-mediated clustering as a generic mechanism for transmembrane signal transmission. Receptor clustering appears to be critical for transmembrane signaling through many receptors. Our results provide insight into molecular mechanisms of the clustering process and indicate a novel mechanism for receptor clustering. The data identify ASM, translocated onto the surface of sphingolipid-rich rafts, as a key player in CD95 clustering and signaling. The experiments using P. aeruginosa-induced up-regulation of CD95 and CD95 ligand indicate the significance of ASM/ceramide-mediated clustering of CD95 for apoptosis even under (patho)physiological conditions. Our data suggest the following function of ASM/ceramide for CD95 clustering: Interaction of membrane-bound CD95 ligand with CD95 results in a transient and weak activation of a limited number of CD95 trimers or oligomers insufficient to trigger apoptosis but sufficient for ASM translocation to the outer membrane leaflet. The notion of a primary weak activation of CD95 is supported by the findings that mere trimerization of CD95 by its ligand is insufficient to induce apoptosis (28Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) and by our preliminary data showing a 50–100-fold reduction of caspase 8 activation in cells lacking ASM upon CD95 stimulation, an event restored by ASM transfection. Translocated ASM, now in the proximity of sphingomyelin that resides in the outer surface of mammalian membranes, will release ceramide. In model membrane systems, ceramide has the unique capacity to spontaneously self-aggregate into microdomains (29Huang H.W. Goldberg E.M. Zidovetzki R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1489-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Veiga M.P. Arrondo J.L. Goni F.M. Alonso A. Biophys.

J. 1996; 71: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). If this event occurred in a preformed microdomain such as caveolae or caveolar-like domains, re-ordering of this domain into a signaling structure might ensue. In fact, a number of groups have now published data demonstrating that ASM functions in sphingolipid-enriched microdomains in various cell types (21Bilderback T.R. Grigsby R.J. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10922-10927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 22Liu P. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In addition, in model membranes ceramide-rich microdomains tend to fuse (32Holopainen J.M. Subramanian M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17562-17570Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and thus, ceramide might further trigger the fusion of rafts to larger platforms. This notion is supported by unpublished findings from our group that CD95 stimulation of NPDA cells expressing an inactive mutant of ASM induces translocation of this mutant protein onto multiple small spots on the cell surface, which fail to fuse into a large cluster. These platforms may finally interact with activated CD95 at the synapse between CD95 ligand and CD95, greatly increasing the stability of their interaction by (a) trapping and locking CD95 molecules within rafts, thus increasing the time of interaction with the ligand, (b) recruiting intracellular signaling molecules to CD95, (c) excluding inhibitory pathways, and/or (d) directly altering the affinity/avidity of CD95 for its ligand. As a result of receptor clustering, intracellular effector molecules mediating CD95 action are brought into close proximity, enabling their transactivation. Thus, e.g. CD95 clustering may concentrate caspase 8 molecules within a confined area amplifying local proteolysis, even if primarily only a few dispersed caspase 8 molecules were active. In accordance with that model, high overexpression of the TNF-R results in its spontaneous multimerization and apoptosis of the transfected cells (33Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I.

In the present study, we employed two anti-ASM antibodies, a polyclonal goat and a monoclonal mouse antibody. Both antibodies were raised against the full-length human ASM protein. To assure that ASM and not a cross-reacting protein was being recognized at the cell surface upon CD95 ligation, we repeated our studies using cells transfected with a Myc- or VSV-tagged ASM construct (see Fig.2 D). The pattern of detection of transfected ASM with either anti-Myc 9E10 or anti-VSV P5D4 antibodies was identical to that detected using the anti-ASM antibodies. Further, lymphocytes derived from ASM knockout mice stained with either the goat or mouse anti-ASM antibodies failed to show a signal, supporting the specificity of these antibodies for ASM. 2E. Gulbins, unpublished observations. Finally, CD95 stimulation of NPDA cells expressing a mutated inactive ASM showed translocation of this protein to the cell surface but no clustering. Fluorescence microscopy studies on those NPDA cells similarly showed a dispersed surface pattern of translocated ASM suggesting that ASM detection by these antibodies is not restricted to aggregated ASM (data not shown). Cell surface ceramide was immunodetected using the anti-ceramide antibody 15B4 raised against C16-ceramide coupled to bovine serum albumin.

https://openalex.org/W2103309832,"Regulation of nuclear receptor gene expression involves dynamic and coordinated interactions with histone acetyl transferase (HAT) and deacetylase complexes. The estrogen receptor (ERα) contains two transactivation domains regulating ligand-independent and -dependent gene transcription (AF-1 and AF-2 (activation functions 1 and 2)). ERα-regulated gene expression involves interactions with cointegrators (<i>e.g.</i>p300/CBP, P/CAF) that have the capacity to modify core histone acetyl groups. Here we show that the ERα is acetylated <i>in vivo.</i>p300, but not P/CAF, selectively and directly acetylated the ERα at lysine residues within the ERα hinge/ligand binding domain. Substitution of these residues with charged or polar residues dramatically enhanced ERα hormone sensitivity without affecting induction by MAPK signaling, suggesting that direct ERα acetylation normally suppresses ligand sensitivity. These ERα lysine residues also regulated transcriptional activation by histone deacetylase inhibitors and p300. The conservation of the ERα acetylation motif in a phylogenetic subset of nuclear receptors suggests that direct acetylation of nuclear receptors may contribute to additional signaling pathways involved in metabolism and development."

Further biochemical analyses showed that the XPC protein by itself preferentially binds to damaged DNA and single-stranded DNA (26Reardon J.T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol.

The second subunit of the XPC complex, HR23B stimulates the in vitro NER reaction only in the presence of XPC (28Sugasawa K. Masutani C. Uchida A. Maekawa T. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D.

Further analyses showed that the association of HR23B with XPC was important for its ability to stimulate NER (30Sugasawa K. Ng J.M. Masutani C. Maekawa T. Uchida A. van der Spek P.J. Eker A.P.

However, the mechanism of NER stimulation by HR23B is still poorly understood (31Batty D. Rapic'-Otrin V. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).In this article we report that the XPC complex contains another factor, CEN2, that is recruited via interaction with XPC. During the analyses of CEN2, we found that NER stimulatory activity of HR23B is due to stabilization of XPC protein. We show that CEN2 and HR23B cooperatively stabilize XPC and thereby stimulate NER in vitro. Thus, we conclude that CEN2 is a novel NER factor and suspect that the XPC complex may be involved not only in DNA repair but also in cell division.

This complex was isolated as a heterodimeric complex and consists of the XPC gene product (XPC) and the human homologue of Rad23 B (HR23B) protein (25Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T.

Further biochemical analyses showed that the XPC protein by itself preferentially binds to damaged DNA and single-stranded DNA (26Reardon J.T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19451-19456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and elicits the translocation of another NER factor, TFIIH, to damaged DNA (27Yokoi M. Masutani C.

The second subunit of the XPC complex, HR23B stimulates the in vitro NER reaction only in the presence of XPC (28Sugasawa K. Masutani C. Uchida A. Maekawa T. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4852-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and this stimulatory activity depends on the region of HR23B that mediates interaction with XPC (29Masutani C. Araki M. Sugasawa K. van der Spek P.J. Yamada A. Uchida A. Maekawa T. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6915-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Further analyses showed that the association of HR23B with XPC was important for its ability to stimulate NER (30Sugasawa K. Ng J.M. Masutani C. Maekawa T. Uchida A. van der Spek P.J. Eker A.P. Rademakers S. Visser C. Aboussekhra A. Wood R.D. Hanaoka F. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6924-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of NER stimulation by HR23B is still poorly understood (31Batty D. Rapic'-Otrin V. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In this article we report that the XPC complex contains another factor, CEN2, that is recruited via interaction with XPC. During the analyses of CEN2, we found that NER stimulatory activity of HR23B is due to stabilization of XPC protein. We show that CEN2 and HR23B cooperatively stabilize XPC and thereby stimulate NER in vitro. Thus, we conclude that CEN2 is a novel NER factor and suspect that the XPC complex may be involved not only in DNA repair but also in cell division. We are grateful to Robin P.

Paradoxically, high consumption of plant-derived phytoestrogens, particularly soybean isoflavones, is associated with a low incidence of breast cancer. To explore the molecular basis for these potential different clinical outcomes, we investigated whether soybean isoflavones elicit distinct transcriptional actions from estrogens. Our results demonstrate that the estrogen 17β-estradiol effectively triggers the transcriptional activation and repression pathways with both estrogen receptors (ERs) ERα and ERβ. In contrast, soybean isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, and biochanin A) are ERβ-selective agonists of transcriptional repression and activation at physiological levels. The molecular mechanism for ERβ selectivity by isoflavones involves their capacity to create an activation function-2 surface of ERβ that has a greater affinity for coregulators than ERα. Phytoestrogens may act as natural selective estrogen receptor modulators that elicit distinct clinical effects from estrogens used for hormone replacement by selectively recruiting coregulatory proteins to ERβ that trigger transcriptional pathways.

Unfortunately, HRT has not lived up to its potential to improve the health of women, because estrogens have been associated with an increased incidence of breast (6Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer, Lancet, 350, 1997, 1047, 1059Google Scholar, 7Colditz G.A.

This relationship has hampered compliance with HRT severely and has sparked an intense pursuit for selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) that have a safer profile (9Baker V.L. Leitman D.

Recently, raloxifene has been approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis (11Clemett D. Spencer C.M. Drugs. 2000; 60: 379-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Raloxifene is classified as a SERM because it exhibits agonist activity in some tissues such as the bone (12Delmas P. Bjarnason N. Mitlak B. Ravoux A.-C. Shah A. Huster W. Draper M. Christiansen C.

There also is a growing interest in using dietary natural plant estrogens (phytoestrogens), particularly those found in soy products, as a potential alternative to the estrogens in HRT (18Clarkson T.

Furthermore, a high intake of dietary phytoestrogens is associated with a lower incidence of breast cancer in women (19Ingram D. Sanders K. Kolybaba M. Lopez D. Lancet. 1997; 350: 990-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Many postmenopausal women are taking phytoestrogens in an effort to alleviate menopausal symptoms without increasing their risk of developing breast cancer. Moreover, many women with a history of breast cancer take phytoestrogens to control menopausal symptoms (32Lee M.M. Lin S.S. Wrensch M.R. Adler S.R. Eisenberg D. J. Natl.

Surg. 2000; 179: 407-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) because estrogens are contraindicated. The isoflavones, genistein, daidzein, and biochanin A, which are abundant in soybeans (34Setchell K.D. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 68 Suppl. 6: 1333-1346Crossref Scopus (1012) Google Scholar) and available widely as herbal tablets, are especially popular among postmenopausal women. Despite their popularity and putative health benefits it is clear that we need to know much more about the molecular mechanisms, safety, and efficacy of isoflavones before they can be recommended to postmenopausal women as an alternative to estrogens for HRT. However, it is clearly important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms whereby isoflavones may elicit distinct clinical actions from estrogens used in HRT. Isoflavones have a structure similar to that of 17β-estradiol (E2) and are capable of binding to the two known estrogen receptors, ERα and ERβ (35Green S. Walter P. Greene G. Krust A. Goffin C.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). Compared with ERα, ERβ exhibits a 7–30-fold greater binding affinity for genistein, whereas E2 binds to ERα and ERβ with equal affinity (38Kuiper G. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar, 39Barkhem T. Carlsson B. Nilsson Y. Enmark E. Gustafsson J. Nilsson S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The relatively selective binding of genistein to ERβ indicates that isoflavones may produce distinct clinical effects from estrogens by selectively triggering ERβ-mediated transcriptional pathways or differentially triggering transcriptional activation or repression pathways by ERβ. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of isoflavones and E2 on transcriptional repression and activation in the presence of ERα or ERβ. Our data demonstrate that isoflavones selectively trigger the transcriptional pathways of ERβ, particularly transcriptional repression. In addition to selectively binding to ERβ, our results suggest that the ERβ selectivity of isoflavones involves their capacity to induce an activation function-2 (AF-2) surface of ERβ that has greater affinity for coregulators such as glucocorticoid interacting receptor protein 1 (GRIP1) (40Hong H. Kohli K. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4948-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) compared with ERα. Phytoestrogens may act as natural SERMs by selectively recruiting coregulators that trigger ERβ-mediated transcriptional pathways. Human ERα and ERβ were provided by P. Chambon and J.-A. Gustafsson, respectively (41An J. Ribeiro R.C. Webb P. Gustafsson J.A. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Leitman D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Three copies of the −125 to −82 human TNF-α promoter fragment (43Leitman D.C. Ribeiro R.C. Mackow E.R. Baxter J.D. West B.L. J. Biol.

A synthetic oligonucleotide containing the 17-nucleotide Gal-responsive element (5′-CGGAGTACTGTCCTCCG-3′) was inserted in between the G and C of the AP-1-like site (5′-TGAGCTCA-3′) at the −105 to −95 region of the TNF-RE and cloned upstream of the −32 to + 45 tk promoter (Gal-TNF-RE tkLuc). U937, U2OS, MDA-MB-435, and MCF-7 cells were obtained from the cell culture facility at the University of California, San Francisco. U937 cells were maintained as described previously (44Leitman D.C. Mackow E.R. Williams T. Baxter J.D. West B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1352-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas U2OS, MDA-MB-435, and MCF-7 cells were maintained and subcultured in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For experiments, cells were collected, transferred to a cuvette, and then electroporated with a Bio-Rad gene pulser as described previously (41An J. Ribeiro R.C. Webb P. Gustafsson J.A. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Leitman D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15161-15166Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) using 3 μg of reporter plasmid and 1 μg of ERα or ERβ expression vectors. After electroporation, the cells were resuspended in media and plated at 1 ml/dish in 12-well multiplates. The cells were treated with E2, genistein, daidzein, or biochanin A (Sigma-Aldrich) 3 h prior to exposure to 5 ng/ml TNF-α (R & D Systems) for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were solubilized with 200 μl of 1× lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was determined using a commercially available kit (Promega). The concentration of hormone required to produce a half-maximal induction (EC50) or inhibition (IC50) of luciferase activity was calculated with the Prism curve-fitting program (Graph Pad Software, version 2.0b). For proliferation studies, parental MCF-7 cells were subcloned at 1 cell/well in the presence of 0.1 nm E2, and the fastest growing clone was selected for experiments. These cells expressed exclusively ERα as determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The cells were plated in duplicate at a density of 25,000 cells/35-mm plate in tissue culture medium containing 3% stripped fetal bovine serum. One day after plating they were treated with increasing concentrations of E2 or genistein. The medium was changed every other day, and E2 or genistein was added to the medium. After 8 days the cells were counted with a Coulter counter. All experiments presented in the figures were performed at least three times, and the data were similar between experiments. U20S cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 3% stripped fetal bovine serum. Cells were treated for 24 h with 10 nm E2or 1 μm genistein and then exposed to 5 ng/ml TNF-α for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using oligo(dT) primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Maloney murine leukemia virus(H−) reverse transcriptase (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. PCR amplification using primers for the human TNF-α (sense 5′-GAGTGACAAGCCTGTAGCCCATGTTGTAGCA-3′ and antisense 5′-GCAATGATCCCAAAGTAGACCTGCCCAGACT-3′) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (sense 5′-TGATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAG-3′ and antisense 5′-TCCTTGGAGG CCATGTGGGCCAT-3′) was performed using the HotStarTaq PCR kit (Qiagen) or Ready-To-Go PCR beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The PCR products were visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The ER-negative human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-453 (45Cailleau R. Young R. Olive M. Reeves W.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1974; 53: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), was transfected by electroporation with pcDNA 6/V5-His (Invitrogen) vector containing human ERα. The cells were maintained in 10 μg/ml blastocidin (Invitrogen) until resistant colonies formed. Individual clones were obtained after the cells were plated into 96-well dishes at 1 cell/well in the presence of blastocidin. The expression of ERα and blastocidin-S deaminase, which confers resistance, was confirmed by RT-PCR in the clonal stable cell line. GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (46Webb P. Nguyen P. Valentine C. Lopez G.N. Kwok G.R. McInerney E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Nilsson S. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1672-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, human ERα and ERβ were transcribed and translated in vitrousing the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega) and [35S]methionine. For each binding reaction, a 2-μl aliquot of translation product was incubated withEscherichia coli-expressed GST-GRIP1 immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of vehicle control (0.1% ethanol), E2, or genistein. The samples were rocked gently at 4 °C for 2 h. After extensive washing of the beads, the labeled proteins were eluted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer and separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The radiolabeled bound ERs were detected by autoradiography and analyzed using the Storm phosphorimaging system and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). To investigate the effects of isoflavones on transcriptional repression, we used the −125 to −82 region (43Leitman D.C. Ribeiro R.C. Mackow E.R. Baxter J.D. West B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9343-9346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the TNF-α promoter (TNF-α-responsive element, (TNF-RE)) because this region mediates TNF-α activation and E2 repression (41An J. Ribeiro R.C. Webb P. Gustafsson J.A. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Leitman D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15161-15166Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). E2 produced a profound dose-dependent repression of TNF-α activation of the TNF-RE upstream of a minimal tk promoter (TNF-RE tkLuc) with either transfected ERα (Fig.1 A) or ERβ (Fig.1 B) in U937 cells. Daidzein and biochanin A had no effect on TNF-α activation of the TNF-RE with ERα, whereas genistein produced a minor repression at 1 μm (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, all three isoflavones produced a large repression (30–60%) of TNF-α activation of TNF-RE in the presence of ERβ (Fig.1 B). Genistein is the most potent isoflavone and is about 65-fold weaker than E2 at repression (IC50 = 8.5 versus 0.13 nm). The isoflavones are more effective also at triggering transcriptional activation of a classical estrogen response element (ERE) in U937 cells with ERβ (Fig.2 B) compared with ERα (Fig.2 A). However, isoflavones are about 10–300-fold more potent at triggering transcriptional repression compared with transcriptional activation with ERβ (genistein, IC50 = 8.5 nm, EC50 = 55 nm; daidzein, IC50 = 0.072 μm, EC50 = 1.2 μm; biochanin A, IC50 = 0.17 μm, EC50 = 50 μm).Figure 2Isoflavones selectively activate transcription of an ERE through ER β. A single copy of the vitellogenin A2 ERE upstream of the minimal tk promoter (ERE tkLuc) was transfected into U937 cells with either 1 μg of expression vector for human ERα (A) or ERβ (B). After transfection, the cells were treated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of E2, genistein, daidzein, or biochanin A, and luciferase activity was determined. Each data point represents the mean of triplicate samples ± S.E.RLU, relative luciferase units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of genistein on endogenous TNF-α gene expression was investigated in a human osteosarcoma cell line (U20S) because these cells express ERα and ERβ, as demonstrated by RT-PCR (data not shown), and TNF-α is involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis (47Pacifici R. J. Bone Miner Res. 1996; 11: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). U20S cells were treated with E2 or genistein for 24 h and then exposed to TNF-α for 1 h. TNF-α produced a profound induction of TNF-α mRNA as determined by RT-PCR that was repressed markedly by E2 or genistein (Fig.3 A). The observation that genistein inhibits endogenous TNF-α mRNA in untransfected cells demonstrates that repression of TNF-α transcription by genistein is physiological and not caused by nonspecific squelching of transcriptional factors by transfected ERs. To determine which ER isoform is responsible for repressing the endogenous TNF-α gene, we transfected U2OS cells with ERα or ERβ. Although the endogenous ERs are capable of repressing the native TNF-α gene, they are not present in high enough levels to repress the large number of transfected plasmids containing the TNF-RE. Fig. 3 B shows that genistein is very effective at repressing the TNF-RE in cells transfected with ERβ but not ERα. These results indicate that genistein represses the endogenous TNF-α gene through ERβ even though U2OS cells also express ERα. Our results indicate that isoflavones selectively promote ERβ-mediated transcription. To explore the activity of genistein on ERα in breast cancer cell lines, we compared the effects of E2 and genistein on ERα activation of ERE tkLuc in an ER-negative breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-453) stably transfected with ERα and on the proliferation of MCF-7 cells, which express endogenous ERα but not ERβ as determined by RT-PCR (data not shown). Similar to transiently transfected U937 and U20S cells, genistein is much weaker than E2 at activating an ERE in the ERα MDA-MB-453 stable cells (Fig.4 A) and stimulating the proliferation of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4 B). Thus, genistein is a weak ERα agonist in cells transiently (U937 and U20S) or stably (MDA-MB-453) transfected with ERα and in cells that express endogenous ERα (MCF-7). A potential explanation for ERβ-selective activity is that isoflavones induce a functional AF-2 surface in ERβ but not ERα because we showed previously that the AF-2 surface is required for repression (41An J. Ribeiro R.C. Webb P. Gustafsson J.A. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Leitman D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15161-15166Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that an ERβ with a mutation in helix 3 (K314A) of the AF-2 surface failed to promote repression in response to genistein (Fig.5). Because binding of coregulatory proteins (48McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar, 49Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to the AF-2 surface is required for repression by E2 (41An J. Ribeiro R.C. Webb P. Gustafsson J.A. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Leitman D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15161-15166Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we compared the effects of E2 and genistein on functional interactions that occur at the TNF-RE between the coregulator, GRIP1 (40Hong H. Kohli K. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4948-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), and ERα or ERβ. For these studies, a Gal response element was inserted in the center of an AP-1-like site in the TNF-RE (Gal-TNF-RE), which is essential for TNF-α activation and E2 repression (41An J. Ribeiro R.C. Webb P. Gustafsson J.A. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Leitman D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15161-15166Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Gal-GRIP1 was used for these studies instead of Gal-ER because ERs do not bind directly to the TNF-RE (41An J. Ribeiro R.C. Webb P. Gustafsson J.A. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Leitman D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15161-15166Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) but may be tethered to the TNF-RE through coregulators such as GRIP1. Gal-GRIP1 activated Gal-TNF-RE tkLuc ∼20-fold (data not shown). E2 is extremely potent at inhibiting Gal-GRIP1 activation of Gal-TNF-RE tkLuc in the presence of either ERα (Fig.6 A) or ERβ (Fig.6 B) (IC50 = 28.5 pm for ERα, and IC50 = 1.5 pm for ERβ). In contrast, genistein is much more potent at repressing Gal-GRIP1 activation with ERβ (IC50 = 49 pm) compared with ERα (IC50 = 1.8 μm). Furthermore, at saturating levels (10 μm), genistein produced a 33% repression with ERα compared with a maximal 72% repression with ERβ at only 10 nm.Figure 6Genistein selectively represses Gal-GRIP1 activation of Gal-TNF-RE through ER β. A synthetic oligonucleotide that contained the 17-nucleotide Gal-responsive element was inserted in between the G and C of the AP-1-like site (5′-TGAGCTCA-3′) at the −105 to −95 region of the TNF-RE. Because the AP-1-like site is destroyed, this construct is inactive in the absence of Gal-GRIP1. Cells were transfected with Gal-GRIP1, Gal-TNF-RE tkLuc, and ERα (A) or ERβ (B) and then treated with increasing concentrations of E2 or genistein for 24 h, and luciferase activity was determined. Gal-GRIP1 activated Gal-TNF-RE tkLuc by about 20-fold in the absence of E2 or genistein. Each data point represents the mean of triplicate samples ± S.E. RLU, relative luciferase units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results suggest that genistein creates an AF-2 surface in ERβ that permits the binding of GRIP1 more efficiently compared with ERα. To investigate this hypothesis directly, glutathioneS-transferase-GRIP1 pull-down assays were performed with either 35S-labeled ERα or ERβ in the presence of E2 or genistein. A similar dose-dependent increase in binding of ERα or ERβ to GRIP1 was observed with E2 (Fig. 7 A). In contrast, genistein is more effective at enhancing the interaction between GRIP1 and ERβ (Fig. 7 B). At 10 μm, binding of ERβ to GRIP1 is 2-fold greater than with ERα. These findings demonstrate that genistein creates an AF-2 surface in ERβ that has a higher affinity for GRIP1 than that in ERα. Estrogens in HRT improve menopausal symptoms but are associated with an increased risk of breast (6Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer, Lancet, 350, 1997, 1047, 1059Google Scholar, 7Colditz G.A.

Gynecol. 1998; 178: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To overcome the uterotropic effects of estrogens, women with a uterus are treated also with progesterone in HRT regimens. Unfortunately, the addition of progesterone may increase the risk of breast cancer further (50Hofseth L.J. Raafat A.M. Osuch J.R. Pathak D.R. Slomski C.A. Haslam S.Z. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 4559-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 51Schairer C. Lubin J. Troisi R. Sturgeon S. Brinton L. Hoover R. J. Am. Med.

Maturitas. 1998; 31: 9-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The current challenge is to discover estrogens that retain their ability to prevent menopausal symptoms without promoting breast cancer or requiring progesterone for endometrium protection. The development of more ideal estrogens for HRT requires a greater understanding of how different estrogenic compounds differentially regulate gene activation and repression by ERα and ERβ. We have shown that isoflavones elicit distinct transcriptional actions from estrogens. E2 effectively triggers both ERα- and ERβ-mediated transcriptional activation or repression pathways. In contrast, our results demonstrate that isoflavones are weak ERα agonists and potent ERβ agonists because they are effective only at triggering transcriptional activation or repression with ERβ. The key question is how do isoflavones elicit distinct transcriptional actions from estrogens despite the fact they both bind to the same binding pocket of ERα and ERβ (53Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar, 54Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M.

Thorsell A.G. Engstrom O. Ljunggren J. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4608-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar)? One possibility is that isoflavones bind to ERβ more effectively than to ERα. In fact, ERβ has a 30-fold greater affinity for genistein compared with ERα (39Barkhem T. Carlsson B. Nilsson Y. Enmark E. Gustafsson J. Nilsson S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). However, this difference in binding affinity is unlikely to account entirely for the distinct transcriptional actions of isoflavones because we observed that isoflavones were over a 1,000-fold more potent at triggering transcriptional activity with ERβ compared with ERα. Furthermore, at saturating levels (10 μm), genistein was less effective at repressing GRIP1 activation of Gal-TNF-RE tkLuc with ERα and recruiting GRIP1 to ERα, compared with ERβ. These studies indicate that the divergent transcriptional actions of estrogens and isoflavones probably also result from differences in their ability to recruit coregulators and trigger transcriptional functions of ERα or ERβ. These data are consistent with the discoveries that coregulator proteins (48McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar, 49Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are required for both transcriptional activation and repression by ERs (41An J. Ribeiro R.C. Webb P. Gustafsson J.A. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Leitman D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15161-15166Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 56Katzenellenbogen B.S. Montano M.M. Ediger T.R. Sun J. Ekena K. Lazennec G.

Steroids. 2000; 65: 227-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). E2 nonselectively recruits coregulators to ERα and ERβ, whereas isoflavones selectively recruit coregulators to ERβ. By recruiting coregulators such as GRIP1 to both ERs, E2effectively triggers transcriptional activation and repression pathways for both ERα and ERβ. Undoubtedly, E2 elicits its full spectrum of beneficial and adverse effects by triggering all transcriptional pathways of ERs. In contrast, at physiological levels (0.55–0.86 μm) (58Barnes S. Sfakianos J. Coward L. Kirk M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 401: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) genistein is very weak at recruiting GRIP1 to ERα, but it is potent at recruiting GRIP1 to ERβ. By selectively recruiting coregulators to ERβ, isoflavones would only trigger ERβ-mediated transcriptional pathways. These results suggest that isoflavones should be effective at eliciting the clinical effects that are mediated by ERβ but not ERα. Moreover, isoflavones are 10–300-fold more potent at triggering transcriptional repression compared with activation. These results indicate that it may be possible to develop transcriptional activation or repression-selective estrogens for HRT. It is unclear why genistein recruits GRIP1 more effectively to ERβ than to ERα. However, the binding of GRIP1 may stabilize the genistein-ERβ complex more effectively than the genistein-ERα complex because the binding of coregulators has been shown to slow the rate of dissociation of an agonist from the ER-coregulator complex (59Gee A.C. Carlson K.E. Martini P.G. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1912-1923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of regulation of ERα-mediated genes and the potent repression of ERβ-mediated genes by isoflavones may account for the low incidence of menopausal symptoms, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and breast and endometrial cancer in Asian countries (19Ingram D. Sanders K. Kolybaba M. Lopez D. Lancet. 1997; 350: 990-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar,21Adlercreutz H. Baillieres Clin. Endocrinol.

For example, our studies suggest that ERβ-mediated repression of the TNF-α gene may be an important mechanism whereby isoflavones may prevent osteoporosis because excessive production of TNF-α after menopause is thought to lead to osteoporosis (47Pacifici R. J. Bone Miner Res. 1996; 11: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Genistein also protects against vascular injury in ovariectomized female rats through ERβ (60Makela S. Savolainen H. Aavik E. Myllarniemi M. Strauss L. Taskinen E. Gustafsson J. Hayry P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7077-7082Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We have shown also that E2produces a robust stimulation of proliferation of breast cancer (MCF-7) cells. ERα undoubtedly mediates this effect because these cells only express ERα. Furthermore, it is likely that ERα mediates the proliferative effects on endometrial cells because these cells do not express ERβ (61Taylor A.H. Al-Azzawi F. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that ERβ-selective estrogens such as isoflavones may prevent some menopausal symptoms and conditions but will be less likely to elicit stimulatory effects on breast and endometrial cells compared with estrogens present in current HRT regimens that also trigger ERα-transcriptional pathways. Consistent with this hypothesis are the observations that isoflavone-rich soy protein relieves menopausal symptoms (30Albertazzi P. Pansini F. Bonaccorsi G. Zanotti L. Forini E. De Aloysio D. Obstet. Gynecol. 1998; 91: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 62Upmalis D.H. Lobo R. Bradley L. Warren M. Cone F.L. Lamia C.A. Menopause. 2000; 7: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) but does not exert estrogenic effects on the endometrium in postmenopausal women (62Upmalis D.H. Lobo R. Bradley L. Warren M.

Metab. 1999; 84: 3479-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Furthermore, isoflavone-rich soy protein does not induce proliferation in endometrial and mammary tissue in postmenopausal female macaques (64Foth D. Cline J.M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 68 Suppl. 6: 1413-1417Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Understanding how natural estrogens and synthetic SERMs elicit selective clinical effects is a key to the development of safer estrogens for HRT. We have shown that isoflavones elicit distinct transcriptional actions from estrogens by selectively recruiting coregulators to ERβ. These data are consistent with the observation that helix 12 of the AF-2 surface exists in a different position when genistein is bound to ERβ (55Pike A.C. Brzozowski A.M. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Thorsell A.G. Engstrom O. Ljunggren J. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4608-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) compared with E2-bound ERα (53Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar) or ERβ (55Pike A.C. Brzozowski A.M. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Thorsell A.G. Engstrom O. Ljunggren J. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4608-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that isoflavones may act as natural SERMs, which may be safer than estrogens in current HRT regimens because they selectively trigger the transcriptional pathways of ERβ. Estrogens in HRT also trigger ERα transcriptional pathways, which may promote the proliferation of breast and endometrial cells. We thank P. Chambon, J.-A. Gustafsson, and M.

https://openalex.org/W1976608130,"Flotillin-1 was recently shown to be enriched on detergent-resistant domains of the plasma membrane called lipid rafts. These rafts, enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol, sequester certain proteins while excluding others. Lipid rafts have been implicated in numerous cellular processes including signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and molecular sorting. In this study, we demonstrate both morphologically and biochemically that lipid rafts are present on phagosomes. These structures are enriched in flotillin-1 and devoid of the main phagosomes membrane protein lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP1). The flotillin-1 present on phagosomes does not originate from the plasma membrane during phagocytosis but accumulates gradually on maturing phagosomes. Treatment with bafilomycin A1, a compound that inhibits the proton pump ATPase and prevents the fusion of phagosomes with late endocytic organelles, prevents the acquisition of flotillin-1 by phagosomes, indicating that this protein might be recruited on phagosomes from endosomal organelles. A proteomic characterization of the lipid rafts of phagosomes indicates that actin, the α- and β-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, as well as subunits of the proton pump V-ATPase are among the constituents of these domains. Remarkably, the intracellular parasite Leishmania donovani can actively inhibit the acquisition of flotillin-1-enriched lipid rafts by phagosomes and the maturation of these organelles. These results indicate that specialized functions required for phagolysosome biogenesis may occur at focal points on the phagosome membrane, and therefore represent a potential target of intracellular pathogens."

PPARγ, like other members of the broad nuclear hormone receptor family, undergoes a conformational change when it binds specific lipid ligands. This structural reorganization alters its associated proteins, releasing transcriptional inhibitors and recruiting transcriptional co-activators. The regulation of PPARγ function is therefore controlled by lipid ligand binding. A number of synthetic ligands for PPARγ are known. One of these, rosiglitazone (BRL49653), binds with high affinity and is widely prescribed as an insulin sensitizer in type II diabetes. However, defining relevant biologic ligands has been problematic. Several oxidatively modified fatty acids bind and activate PPARγ, including 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2(15-deoxy-PGJ2), other arachidonate metabolites (2Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P.

However, none of these are particularly potent agonists, and for some their presence at concentrations sufficient to activate PPARγ can be questioned. For example, the oxygenated fatty acid products described above do not confer much advantage in potency over activation by free arachidonate (7Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 153-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) where a concentration of several micromolar is required to elicit a response. Moreover, the 9- and 13-HODEs and their peroxides found in oxidized LDL (8Folcik V.A. Cathcart M.K. J.

CD36 is a member of the scavenger receptor family that promotes the uptake of oxidized LDL, driving macrophages to a lipid-surfeit state characterized by foamy fatty inclusions. Cells in atherosclerotic lesions express PPARγ (19Marx N. Sukhova G. Murphy C. Libby P. Plutzky J. Am. J.

Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 688-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CD36 ligation and internalization of LDL particles oxidized by monocytes is blocked by an excess of oxidized phospholipids (21Podrez E.A. Febbraio M. Sheibani N. Schmitt D. Silverstein R.L. Hajjar D.P. Cohen P.A. Frazier W.A. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1095-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), suggesting that one or more oxidized phospholipids is a CD36 ligand responsible for the internalization of oxLDL. Here we show that a complex lipid (i.e. a phospholipid) formed by oxidative attack on a subclass of LDL phospholipids is effectively internalized by CD36 and is a high affinity, selective PPARγ ligand and agonist. Alkyl phosphatidylcholines, which consist of a small portion of the LDL phosphatidylcholine pool (22Diagne A. Fauvel J. Record M. Chap H. Douste-Blazy L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 793: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), are the sole precursors for these agonists because there is selectivity for thesn-1 bond in both binding and PPRE reporter activation. We conclude that certain oxidized alkyl phospholipids define a new class of high affinity agonists for PPARγ, and because these are found in oxidized LDL, they may contribute to its biologic effects. PAF was from Avanti Polar Lipids; lyso-PAF (1-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), 9-cis-retinoate, pirinixic acid (WY14643), and 15-deoxy-PGJ2 were from Biomol; Rhizopus arrhizus lipase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and then Sigma; [3H]rosiglitazone and rosiglitazone were from the American Radiolabeled Chemicals. ECL kits were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; the SV40-β-galactosidase reporter was from Promega (Madison, WI); the CD36 reporter constructs with (−273) and without (−261) its PPRE (17Tontonoz P.

The forward primers (for CD36−273) were 5′-GCGACGCGTCTGGCCTCTGACTTACTTGG-3′ or (CD36−261) 5′-GCGACGCGTTTACTTGGATGGGAACTAGCC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GGAAGATCTAGTCCTACACTGCAGTCCTC-3′. The amplicon was inserted into pGL3b at the MluI and BcgII sites. pGL3b was fromPromega, and Probond Ni+ beads were from Invitrogen.

The lipid azPC was synthesized from 1-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (hexadecyl lyso-PC; after mild alkaline hydrolysis; 0.5 nNaOH in methanol; 4 h; 24 oC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (palmitoyl azelaoyl-PC) was synthesized in a similar fashion from palmitoyl lyso-PC. After neutralization, purified lipid (2 mg) was reacted with 10 mg of azelaic anhydride (University of Utah Chemical Synthesis Facility) in the presence of 1 mg of 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine in CHCl3:pyridine (4:1) for 36 h before purification by RP-HPLC. The mass of each synthetic phospholipid was determined by phosphorus analysis (28Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mass spectroscopy of lipid oxidation products was performed as before (27Marathe G.K. Davies S.S. Harrison K.A. Silva A.R. Murphy R.C. Castro-Faria Neto H. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M.

[3H]Hexadecyl azelaic phosphatidylcholine was synthesized from [3H]hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and HPLC-purified in a similar fashion. Human monocytes were isolated by counter-current elutriation (29Elstad M.R. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1618-1624PubMed Google Scholar) and resuspended (1 × 106/ml) in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 0.5% human serum albumin and 10 μg/ml polymyxin B. Monocytes were added to plates coated with 10 μg/ml CAL3.10 anti-ICAM-3 monoclonal antibody (30Kessel J.M. Hayflick J. Weyrich A.S. Hoffman P.A. Gallatin M. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5579-5587PubMed Google Scholar). CV-1 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown as suggested. Surface expression of CD36 on primary human monocytes was determined by allowing elutriated monocytes to adhere to anti-ICAM3-coated wells for 1 h before the cells were exposed to the lipid agonists, or not, as stated in the figures. Some cells were maintained in a suspended state by gently rocking on a platform rocker in polypropylene tubes as a control. Adherent cells were released from the plate by gentle agitation and scraping and washed three times in PBS containing 1% goat serum. Recovered cells were stained with FITC-labeled anti-CD36 antibody CLB-IVC7 for flow analysis by the University of Utah flow analysis core facility. The acyl-CoA oxidase-luciferase plasmid was described previously (31Meade E.A. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8328-8334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transformed into TOP10F′Escherichia coli strain using the TA cloning kit. Plasmids from log phase cells were isolated using a Bigger Prep kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), and purified by CsCl gradients. The His6-tagged PPARγ was constructed similarly using the M13 primer in pCR2.1 that contained full-length PPARγ1 and a primer (5′-CTA ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG GTA CAA GTC CTT GTA G-3′) containing the His6 tag sequence. PPARγ and PPARα expression plasmids were a gift from Beth Meade (University of Utah). Inserts in all plasmids were sequence-verified by the University of Utah sequencing core facility. When PPAR expression plasmids were co-transfected with a reporter construct, 0.5 μg of the relevant plasmid was combined with 1 μg of pGL3-PPRE and 0.1 μg of the SV40-β-galactosidase reporter to normalize transfection efficiencies. All transfections included 1–2 μg of total plasmid, and 5–10 μl of LipofectAMINE per ml of Opti-MEM. Transfection solution was added to CV-1 cells overnight and then removed, and agonist was added in fresh media for 18–20 h. [3H]Rosiglitazone displacement from PPARγ was determined with a carboxy His6-tagged molecule. HeLa cells were transfected with pCR3.1-PPARγ-His6 or pCR3.1 for 21 h with LipofectAMINE and then grown (48 h). The cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and frozen at −70 °C until used. Transfection with PPARγ-His6 was assessed by immunoblotting with anti-His6 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Debris was removed from thawed samples, and 200 μl of lysate was incubated with 50 μl of Probond beads at 4 °C for 1 h in PBS. The beads were washed once by centrifugation before [3H]rosiglitazone, and then unlabeled competitor was added in a final volume of 300 μl of PBS. Samples were incubated with shaking for 3 h at 4 °C before washing three times with PBS and quantitating retained3H. Binding of [3H]azelaic phosphatidylcholine to PPARγ was performed in a similar fashion, although the amount of protein lysate was increased to account for its lower specific radioactivity. Accumulation of [3H]azPC was estimated by incubating monolayers with carrier-free [3H]azPC (22.9 Ci/mmol) for 30 min in the presence or absence of the lipids specified in the figure at a concentration of 10 μm (except HPLC fraction 6 from oxLDL that was used at a concentration that maximally induced ACox reporter expression since there was insufficient material for phosphorus quantitation). Some cells were preincubated for 30 min with 10 μg of the blocking anti-CD36 antibody 185–1G2 or an irrelevant IgG2a isotype-matched control monoclonal antibody. We oxidized human LDL, extracted the lipids, and separated nonpolar lipids (which we found to have no activity in this assay; not shown) from the polar phospholipid oxidation products. We separately examined these polar phospholipid-containing fractions as agonists using CV-1 cells that had been transiently transfected with an acyl-CoA oxidase PPRE-firefly luciferase reporter construct and SV40-β-galactosidase to normalize for transfection efficiency. These purified polar phospholipids stimulated luciferase transcription under the control of this PPRE (Fig. 1), and this activity was concentrated in RP-HPLC fraction 6. We found this material to be as effective an agonist for PPAR-induced transcription as rosiglitazone (BRL49653), and a synthetic oxidized phospholipid (azPC) is discussed in detail below. Fig. 1 shows that an equivalent fraction from the same batch of LDL that had not been oxidized contained little stimulatory activity. Oxidation of LDL creates oxidized phosphatidylcholines that are potent inflammatory agents because they structurally resemble PAF and activate the cloned receptor for PAF. Oxidized phospholipids of this class are all derived from the small pool of alkyl phosphatidylcholines in LDL (22Diagne A. Fauvel J. Record M. Chap H. Douste-Blazy L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 793: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) that are resistant to phospholipase A1digestion (27Marathe G.K. Davies S.S. Harrison K.A. Silva A.R. Murphy R.C. Castro-Faria Neto H. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28395-28405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To determine whether the oxidatively generated agonists that induce transcription from a PPRE reporter construct also fall into this class, we digested the fractions isolated by HPLC with phospholipase A1. This removes the oxidized diacyl phospholipids, derived from the 99.5% of LDL phospholipids that have an sn-1 ester bond, as assessed by phosphorus analysis (not shown). Phospholipase A1 digestion had no effect on the ability of the fractions isolated from oxidized LDL to stimulate luciferase expression from the PPRE-reporter construct (Fig. 1), indicating that only alkyl phosphatidylcholine oxidation products were effective agonists in this assay. We determined which alkyl phosphatidylcholine oxidation products were present in oxidized LDL by resolving the phospholipase A1-treated phospholipids by reversed phase HPLC and examining these by electrospray tandem mass spectroscopy as precursors of the phosphocholine ion m/z 184. An abundant ion in the HPLC effluent was observed at m/z 652 (Fig.2 a), potentially corresponding to 1-O-hexadecyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (azPC). This component was maximal in RP-HPLC fraction 6 (Fig. 2,inset), whereas the C4-PAF analogs were most abundant in fractions 7 and 8, as reported previously (27Marathe G.K. Davies S.S. Harrison K.A. Silva A.R. Murphy R.C. Castro-Faria Neto H. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28395-28405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A structurally unique diagnostic product of sn-2 ω-carboxyl glycerophosphocholine lipids is the collision-induced rearrangement of a methyl group and decomposition to a monomethyl acid and dimethyl lyso-PC (32Kayganich-Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Proof that azPC was present was obtained by collision-induced decomposition of the corresponding [M − H]− of m/z 650 (Fig. 2 b) that yielded the expected product ions at m/z 201 and 466 corresponding to monomethyl azelaic acid and the dimethyl lyso-PAF adduct resulting from the loss of the sn-2 methylazelaoyl ketene. azPC is therefore an abundant oxidation product of LDL alkyl phosphatidylcholines. We confirmed this deduction by synthesizing azPC and finding that synthetic azPC produced the same fragmentation pattern as the material isolated from oxidized LDL (not shown). We experimentally determined whether a complex lipid like azPC could function as a ligand for PPARγ. We synthesized [3H]hexadecyl azelaoyl phosphatidylcholine ([3H]azPC) and incubated it with full-length recombinant human PPARγ1. The PPARγ in transfected HeLa cell lysates was immobilized on Ni+ beads through an introduced His6 tag, so tight binding could be assessed after collecting and washing the beads. We found (Fig.3 a) that [3H]azPC bound to PPARγ, and that this binding was dependent on the concentration of immobilized hPPARγ1. We next varied the concentration of [3H]azPC to establish its apparent affinity for PPARγ under these conditions. We found that the binding of [3H]azPC was concentration-dependent and that its apparent affinity was ≈40 nm (Fig. 3 b). However, we also found that different lysates provided different apparent affinities, perhaps reflecting a similar wide disparity in reported apparent affinities for rosigitazone (2Forman B.M.

Lazar M.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To determine better whether azPC bound PPARγ as effectively as rosigitazone, we directly compared [3H]azPC binding with [3H]rosiglitazone binding at low concentrations and found (Fig. 3 c) that [3H]azPC binding precisely mirrored the binding of [3H]rosiglitazone to immobilized PPARγ1. Rosiglitazone co-crystallizes with the ligand-binding domain of PPARγ (35Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V.

We found (Fig. 4 a) that azPC displaced the standard ligand [3H]rosiglitazone in a concentration-dependent fashion and that the concentration relationship of this competition was identical to that of unlabeled rosiglitazone. azPC bound PPARγ only through this ligand-binding pocket because this competition with rosiglitazone was complete. We examined the effect of other lipids as competitors at 6.7 μm where azPC and rosiglitazone competition was complete and found (Fig. 4 b) that PAF and 15-deoxy-PGJ2could only displaced about a third of the [3H]rosiglitazone at this concentration. Free azelaic acid, like arachidonate, was an ineffective competitor. We performed the converse experiment where unlabeled rosiglitazone or azPC was used to displace [3H]azPC bound to immobilized PPARγ. We found (Fig. 4 c) that unlabeled rosiglitazone displaced nearly all of the [3H]azPC from PPARγ as its concentration was increased, just as unlabeled azPC displaced this bound [3H]azPC. We tested other lipids for their ability to displace [3H]azPC and found (Fig. 4 d) that PAF, and to a lesser extent lyso-PAF, was a modest competitor, but that 9-HODE or 13-HODE were unable to displace bound [3H]azPC. We tested palmitoyl azelaoyl-PC, the diacyl homolog of hexadecyl azelaoyl PC, as a PPARγ ligand, and we found it to be 10–100-fold less potent as a competitor (not shown). azPC was a ligand for PPARγ, so we next determined whether it was an agonist. We transfected CV-1 cells with a luciferase reporter under the control of the PPRE from acyl-CoA oxidase, along with SV40-β−galactosidase as a transfection control, and then treated the cells with rosiglitazone, synthetic azPC, or 9-cis-retinoate to activate RXR. Rosiglitazone induced a 3.4-fold increase in reporter expression, and azPC induced a 3.9-fold increase (Fig.5 a) in this assay. Fig. 1presented a similar result where azPC induced a 3.9-fold increase in ACox reporter expression. Activation of just the RXR subunit with 9-cis-retinoate, which can act as a phantom ligand (37Schulman I.G. Li C. Schwabe J.W. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), was not as effective as either PPARγ ligand in stimulating reporter expression. We compared the concentration-response relationship of azPC and its acyl analog with rosiglitazone as PPARγ agonists. CV-1 cells were transfected with the ACox reporter and SV40-β-galactosidase for normalization, and we then treated with increasing concentrations of azPC, diacyl azPC, or rosiglitazone. We found that azPC induced a concentration-dependent increase in reporter expression starting by about 10−8m (Fig.5 b). Half-maximal activation occurred by 10−7m, and maximal expression was achieved by 1 μm. Rosiglitazone also induced a concentration-dependent increase, and this relationship was identical to that of azPC. We also examined the diacyl homolog of azPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, as an agonist; we found that it was about 100-fold less effective than azPC and only began to elicit an effect at 10 μm. We determined the specificity of azPC as a PPARγ agonist by transfecting CV-1 cells with PPARα or PPARγ expression plasmids in addition to the ACox reporter and an SV40 β-galactosidase transfection control. Rosiglitazone induced an 8-fold increase in reporter expression in this experiment (Fig. 6) in untransfected cells that rely on their endogenous PPARs. This was a more robust response than the 5.3-fold increase induced by the PPARα-selective agonist WY14643 or the 5-fold increase induced by azPC in these control cells. When PPARγ was overexpressed in these cells, the response to rosiglitazone was markedly enhanced (a 25-fold induction), as was the response to azPC (an 18-fold induction). In contrast, overexpression of PPARα failed to enhance the existing response to either azPC or rosiglitazone. The ectopic PPARα was functional because the PPARα-selective agonist WY14643 enhanced expression in cells overexpressing PPARα and not in cells transfected with PPARγ. We determined whether endogenous PPAR-regulated genes were induced by azPC, and for this we chose CD36, a scavenger receptor that binds and internalizes oxidized LDL particles. Intriguingly, transcription of CD36 in monocytes is stimulated by unknown ligands associated with oxidized LDL (10Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M.

All four ligands contain consensus sequences for proteolytic cleavage by furin within their extracellular domain. In the case of EDA, two overlapping consensus sites are located between the transmembrane and the collagen-like domains (Fig. 1 A). EDA-A1, but not EDA-A2, has been shown to specifically bind to EDAR, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily that, like most members of the TNF receptor family, activates the NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways (3Yan M. Wang L.C. Hymowitz S.G. Schilbach S. Lee J. Goddard A. de Vos A.M. Gao W.Q. Dixit V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 10Tucker A.S. Headon D.J. Schneider P.

Mutations in DL (EDAR), the human homologue of the murine downless locus, produce an identical phenotype to loss of function of EDA (11Headon D.J. Overbeek P.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 12Monreal A.W. Ferguson B.M. Headon D.J. Street S.L. Overbeek P.A. Zonana J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). XEDAR, another member of the TNF receptor superfamily that also activates the NF-κB pathway, binds EDA-A2 but not EDA-A1. Although EDA-A1 and EDA-A2 are closely related splice variants, the respective proteins appear to have different patterns of expression in mouse skin and hair follicles (3Yan M. Wang L.C. Hymowitz S.G. Schilbach S. Lee J. Goddard A. de Vos A.M. Gao W.Q. Dixit V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Intracellular signals elicited by EDA in vivo rely at least in part on the activation of NF-κB, because a rare form of HED associated with immunodeficiency (HED-ID) correlates with mutations in NEMO/IKK-γ, an essential component of the NF-κB pathway (13Zonana J. Elder M.E. Schneider L.C. Orlow S.J. Moss C. Golabi M. Shapira S.K. Farndon P.A. Wara D.W. Emmal S.A. Ferguson B.M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 1555-1562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar).In order to get insight into the structure-function relationship of EDA, we identified 44 mutations (17 of which have not been reported previously) in unrelated families with XLHED and studied their effect on the properties of EDA in vitro. The mutations clustered in three functionally important domains as follows: a TNF homology domain necessary for receptor binding, a bundle-forming collagen domain, and a cleavage site for a furin protease. This indicates that the receptor binding ability of EDA and also its oligomerization and proteolytic processing to a soluble form are critical events for its action in vivo.DISCUSSIONIn this study, mutations in the EDA gene were detected in 63% of the families with XLHED, which is lower than the 95% rate we found previously (2Monreal A.W. Zonana J. Ferguson B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 380-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) by the direct sequencing of affected males. The lower detection rate is the consequence of two factors. The use of a single set of conditions lowers the sensitivity of SSCP analysis, as only 11 of the 15 known mutations run as controls could be detected under these conditions (73%). In addition, this study included 28% of families with “affected” females only, which was not the case in our previous study. Indeed, the detection rate was lower in families with female probands (45%), and this may well be due to genetic heterogeneity for autosomal forms of HED.A number of point mutations are located within the TNF homology domain of EDA, but only one of them (Y343C) affects a residue which, based on structural homology with known ligand-receptor structures (4Hymowitz S.G. O'Connell M.P. Ultsch M.H. Hurst A. Totpal K. Ashkenazi A. de Vos A.M. Kelley R.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 5Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), is predicted to interact with the receptor. Indeed, this mutation abolished receptor binding without affecting the trimeric structure of EDA, although we cannot exclude indirect conformational effects. All other mutations are predicted to have indirect effect on receptor binding, e.g. by altering the folding of EDA. It is noteworthy that four independent mutations (G291W, G291R, A356D, R357P) occurred in two short loops at the bottom of EDA (loops BCand FG, see Fig. 1 A). The affected amino acids are probably crucial for proper folding of the monomer, as mutation A356D resulted in insoluble EDA-A1 and EDA-A2. Another group of mutations (H252L, S374R) seems to affect the stability of the trimer, because the resulting proteins contain a proportion of monomers. The propensity of unglycosylated subunits to form larger aggregates support the idea that glycosylation of some TNF family members promotes their solubility (18Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Holler N. Mattmann C. Scuderi P. Terskikh A. Peitsch M.C. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18827-18833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one of the mutations (S374R) destroys a potential N-glycosylation site without affecting the glycosylation of EDA, suggesting that this particular site is not recognized by the N-glycosyltransferase. A single mutant (S374R) retained some binding activity to EDAR. Although preferential binding of the unglycosylated (and most probably aggregated) isoform was observed, the interaction appeared specific, suggesting that residual activity may be associated with this mutation in vivo. In general, no apparent phenotype/genotype correlation was observed, but the family with missense mutation S374R had two affected males and an affected maternal grandfather with isolated hypodontia. Whether residual activity of this mutant may account for the milder phenotype, and whether there is truly a tissue-specific difference in the function of this mutant protein remains to be determined. Finally, one mutation (T378M) affected secretion and aggregation of EDA-A1 and EDA-A2 in a strikingly different manner. The structural reason for this differential behavior is unclear. In summary, all missense mutations in the TNF homology domain result in abolished or much impaired binding of EDA-A1 to EDAR and EDA-A2 to XEDAR.A number of mutations occurring outside the TNF homology domain did not affect binding to the receptor in an in vitro assay, indicating that the interaction of EDA with its receptor(s) is necessary but not sufficient for its function in vivo. In particular, the integrity of the collagen domain appears to be functionally essential, and we provided evidence that it may serve to multimerize EDA trimers. This is in strong support of the hypothesis that EDA belongs to the C1q as well as to the TNF family of proteins (19Mikkola M.L. Pispa J. Pekkanen M. Paulin L. Nieminen P. Kere J. Thesleff I. Mech. Dev. 1999; 88: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). C1q family members are characterized by the presence of a C-terminal globular trimeric domain, with striking structural homology to TNF (20Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 335-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is prolonged by a collagen triple helix further assembling into an N-terminal bundle structure, giving rise to a highly multimeric superstructure. In the TNF family, it has been shown that the activity of soluble trimers can be dramatically increased by antibody-mediated multimerization, thereby mimicking the membrane-bound form of the ligand (16Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 21Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). A highly multimeric structure of EDA would provide a powerful means for the soluble protein to signal through high valency receptor clustering. In line with this hypothesis, we found that a naturally occurring point mutation (G207R) in the collagen domain completely abolished the bundle effect. It is, however, likely that the collagen domain also serves additional functions; a number of families with XLHED displayed in frame deletion of 2 or 4 GlyXY repeats in the predicted bundle domain of the collagen triple helix, i.e. before the interruption in the GlyXY repeats. Deletions of 2 GlyXY repeats can also be found C-terminal to the interruption. Surprisingly, the activity of recombinant proteins containing these types of deletions was indistinguishable from wild type, at least in the model systems utilized. The deletions may specifically affect multimerization of the collagen domain under in vivo conditions. Alternatively, the collagen domain may have additional functions, e.g.interaction with other proteins. It is well known for C1q that the collagen domain interacts with the serine proteases C1r and C1s to form C1, the first component of the serum complement system, and with a number of other proteins, including membrane-bound receptors (22Eggleton P. Reid K.B. Tenner A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 428-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Further investigations are required to understand the molecular mechanism underlying loss of function of EDA in these particular deletion mutants.15 families with XLHED displayed 5 distinct mutations in the furin consensus recognition sequences of EDA, demonstrating an important functional role for this 7-aa sequence. The release of soluble EDA upon proteolytic processing is an expected event, as mRNAs for EDA and EDAR are not expressed in adjacent cells but rather in spatially distinct tissues, at least in the developing tooth (10Tucker A.S. Headon D.J. Schneider P. Ferguson B.M. Overbeek P. Tschopp J. Sharpe P.T. Development. 2000; 127: 4691-4700PubMed Google Scholar). EDA contains two overlapping furin recognition sequences (RVRR and RNKR spanning aa 153–156 and 156–159, respectively). Because Arg156 is part of both sequences, it is hardly surprising that mutation R156C completely abolished EDA processing. Mutation R153C also affected the cleavage of EDA, but in a less dramatic manner. Although this mutation destroys only one of the two furin sites, this must be sufficiently disturbing to prevent efficient release of EDA from the cells naturally expressing it. These cells may express low amounts of furin or furin isoforms whose specificity may extend further than the canonical tetrapeptide recognition sequence. However, as mutations affecting the first furin domain invariably yield Cys residues, and as these Cys residues appear to form novel disulfide bridges, it is possible that this novel structural constraint prevents proper recognition of the remaining intact furin site. It also clearly appears from this study that, beside the furin cleavage sites, there are no alternative sites for solubilization of EDA. In particular, the sequence RRER (aa 69–72) and the basic motives KNKK and KGKK (aa 171–174 and 175–178) were not cleaved in our expression system. The latter two motifs are encoded in the small exon 4 and are also found in the sequences of Tweak and APRIL. However, mutations in these sequences have not been described so far in association with XLHED.A single splice site mutation was detected in the current study (IVS8 G+5 → A), which affects the splice donor site of exon 8 utilized to generate the 391-aa EDA-A1 isoform of the ligand. EDA-A2 utilizes an alternate splice site 6 base pairs 5′ to this site. This mutation probably interferes with splicing of EDA-A1 but not EDA-A2, as computer analysis by HSPL (prediction of splice sites in human DNA sequence) demonstrates a complete loss of the A1 but not of the A2 donor site. This together with the fact that genetic defects in EDA and in EDAR both lead to identical phenotypes indicate a crucial role for EDA-A1/EDAR interactions during morphogenesis. The role of the parallel EDA-A2/XEDAR interaction is less well established. If at all involved in hair, sweat gland, and teeth formation, it is not able to rescue a genetic deficiency in EDAR. In addition, there is no evidence to date for mutations in XEDAR being associated with the HED phenotype. XEDAR may play a distinct role in skin development, which does not translate into an HED phenotype upon dysfunction. Alternatively, inactivation of XEDAR might be lethal, but this would only be possible if it binds another ligand beside EDA-A2 or fulfills a vital, ligand-independent function. TROY/TAJ is a close sequence homologue of XEDAR, which is also expressed in the developing skin (23Kojima T. Morikawa Y. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Senba E. Kitamura T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15336-15342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The precise functional roles of XEDAR and TROY and their interplay with the EDAR pathway remain to be determined. The ED1 gene encodes a protein, ectodysplasin-A (EDA),1 recently recognized to be a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily of ligands. Mutations within the ED1 gene cause an X-linked recessive disorder, hypohidrotic or anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (ED1, XLHED) (Mendelian inheritance in man 305100), involving abnormal morphogenesis of teeth, hair, and eccrine sweat glands. Various splice forms of the ED1 transcript have been detected, but two isoforms differing only by two amino acids, EDA-A1 (391 aa) and EDA-A2 (389 aa), contain a TNF homology domain (1Bayes M.

EDA is a type II transmembrane protein with a small N-terminal intracellular domain and a larger C-terminal extracellular domain containing a (Gly-X-Y)19 collagen-like repeat with a single interruption and a C-terminal TNF homology domain (Fig. 1 A). The TNF homology domain is similar to other members of the TNF family, consisting of 10 predicted anti-parallel β-sheets linked by variable loops (Fig. 1 A). TNF family ligands homotrimerize to form a pear-shaped quaternary structure able to bind a receptor molecule at each monomer-monomer interface (4Hymowitz S.G. O'Connell M.P. Ultsch M.H. Hurst A.

The lower detection rate is the consequence of two factors. The use of a single set of conditions lowers the sensitivity of SSCP analysis, as only 11 of the 15 known mutations run as controls could be detected under these conditions (73%). In addition, this study included 28% of families with “affected” females only, which was not the case in our previous study.

In summary, all missense mutations in the TNF homology domain result in abolished or much impaired binding of EDA-A1 to EDAR and EDA-A2 to XEDAR.A number of mutations occurring outside the TNF homology domain did not affect binding to the receptor in an in vitro assay, indicating that the interaction of EDA with its receptor(s) is necessary but not sufficient for its function in vivo. In particular, the integrity of the collagen domain appears to be functionally essential, and we provided evidence that it may serve to multimerize EDA trimers. This is in strong support of the hypothesis that EDA belongs to the C1q as well as to the TNF family of proteins (19Mikkola M.L. Pispa J. Pekkanen M. Paulin L. Nieminen P. Kere J. Thesleff I. Mech.

C1q family members are characterized by the presence of a C-terminal globular trimeric domain, with striking structural homology to TNF (20Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Curr.

A highly multimeric structure of EDA would provide a powerful means for the soluble protein to signal through high valency receptor clustering. In line with this hypothesis, we found that a naturally occurring point mutation (G207R) in the collagen domain completely abolished the bundle effect. It is, however, likely that the collagen domain also serves additional functions; a number of families with XLHED displayed in frame deletion of 2 or 4 GlyXY repeats in the predicted bundle domain of the collagen triple helix, i.e. before the interruption in the GlyXY repeats.

Further investigations are required to understand the molecular mechanism underlying loss of function of EDA in these particular deletion mutants.15 families with XLHED displayed 5 distinct mutations in the furin consensus recognition sequences of EDA, demonstrating an important functional role for this 7-aa sequence. The release of soluble EDA upon proteolytic processing is an expected event, as mRNAs for EDA and EDAR are not expressed in adjacent cells but rather in spatially distinct tissues, at least in the developing tooth (10Tucker A.S.

EDA contains two overlapping furin recognition sequences (RVRR and RNKR spanning aa 153–156 and 156–159, respectively). Because Arg156 is part of both sequences, it is hardly surprising that mutation R156C completely abolished EDA processing.

However, mutations in these sequences have not been described so far in association with XLHED.A single splice site mutation was detected in the current study (IVS8 G+5 → A), which affects the splice donor site of exon 8 utilized to generate the 391-aa EDA-A1 isoform of the ligand. EDA-A2 utilizes an alternate splice site 6 base pairs 5′ to this site. This mutation probably interferes with splicing of EDA-A1 but not EDA-A2, as computer analysis by HSPL (prediction of splice sites in human DNA sequence) demonstrates a complete loss of the A1 but not of the A2 donor site. This together with the fact that genetic defects in EDA and in EDAR both lead to identical phenotypes indicate a crucial role for EDA-A1/EDAR interactions during morphogenesis. The role of the parallel EDA-A2/XEDAR interaction is less well established. If at all involved in hair, sweat gland, and teeth formation, it is not able to rescue a genetic deficiency in EDAR. In addition, there is no evidence to date for mutations in XEDAR being associated with the HED phenotype. XEDAR may play a distinct role in skin development, which does not translate into an HED phenotype upon dysfunction. Alternatively, inactivation of XEDAR might be lethal, but this would only be possible if it binds another ligand beside EDA-A2 or fulfills a vital, ligand-independent function. TROY/TAJ is a close sequence homologue of XEDAR, which is also expressed in the developing skin (23Kojima T. Morikawa Y. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Senba E. Kitamura T. J. Biol.

The precise functional roles of XEDAR and TROY and their interplay with the EDAR pathway remain to be determined. In this study, mutations in the EDA gene were detected in 63% of the families with XLHED, which is lower than the 95% rate we found previously (2Monreal A.W. Zonana J. Ferguson B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 380-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) by the direct sequencing of affected males. The lower detection rate is the consequence of two factors. The use of a single set of conditions lowers the sensitivity of SSCP analysis, as only 11 of the 15 known mutations run as controls could be detected under these conditions (73%). In addition, this study included 28% of families with “affected” females only, which was not the case in our previous study. Indeed, the detection rate was lower in families with female probands (45%), and this may well be due to genetic heterogeneity for autosomal forms of HED. A number of point mutations are located within the TNF homology domain of EDA, but only one of them (Y343C) affects a residue which, based on structural homology with known ligand-receptor structures (4Hymowitz S.G. O'Connell M.P. Ultsch M.H. Hurst A. Totpal K. Ashkenazi A. de Vos A.M. Kelley R.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 5Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), is predicted to interact with the receptor. Indeed, this mutation abolished receptor binding without affecting the trimeric structure of EDA, although we cannot exclude indirect conformational effects. All other mutations are predicted to have indirect effect on receptor binding, e.g. by altering the folding of EDA. It is noteworthy that four independent mutations (G291W, G291R, A356D, R357P) occurred in two short loops at the bottom of EDA (loops BCand FG, see Fig. 1 A). The affected amino acids are probably crucial for proper folding of the monomer, as mutation A356D resulted in insoluble EDA-A1 and EDA-A2. Another group of mutations (H252L, S374R) seems to affect the stability of the trimer, because the resulting proteins contain a proportion of monomers. The propensity of unglycosylated subunits to form larger aggregates support the idea that glycosylation of some TNF family members promotes their solubility (18Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Holler N. Mattmann C. Scuderi P. Terskikh A. Peitsch M.C. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18827-18833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one of the mutations (S374R) destroys a potential N-glycosylation site without affecting the glycosylation of EDA, suggesting that this particular site is not recognized by the N-glycosyltransferase. A single mutant (S374R) retained some binding activity to EDAR. Although preferential binding of the unglycosylated (and most probably aggregated) isoform was observed, the interaction appeared specific, suggesting that residual activity may be associated with this mutation in vivo. In general, no apparent phenotype/genotype correlation was observed, but the family with missense mutation S374R had two affected males and an affected maternal grandfather with isolated hypodontia. Whether residual activity of this mutant may account for the milder phenotype, and whether there is truly a tissue-specific difference in the function of this mutant protein remains to be determined. Finally, one mutation (T378M) affected secretion and aggregation of EDA-A1 and EDA-A2 in a strikingly different manner. The structural reason for this differential behavior is unclear. In summary, all missense mutations in the TNF homology domain result in abolished or much impaired binding of EDA-A1 to EDAR and EDA-A2 to XEDAR. A number of mutations occurring outside the TNF homology domain did not affect binding to the receptor in an in vitro assay, indicating that the interaction of EDA with its receptor(s) is necessary but not sufficient for its function in vivo. In particular, the integrity of the collagen domain appears to be functionally essential, and we provided evidence that it may serve to multimerize EDA trimers. This is in strong support of the hypothesis that EDA belongs to the C1q as well as to the TNF family of proteins (19Mikkola M.L. Pispa J. Pekkanen M. Paulin L. Nieminen P. Kere J. Thesleff I. Mech. Dev. 1999; 88: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). C1q family members are characterized by the presence of a C-terminal globular trimeric domain, with striking structural homology to TNF (20Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 335-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is prolonged by a collagen triple helix further assembling into an N-terminal bundle structure, giving rise to a highly multimeric superstructure. In the TNF family, it has been shown that the activity of soluble trimers can be dramatically increased by antibody-mediated multimerization, thereby mimicking the membrane-bound form of the ligand (16Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 21Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). A highly multimeric structure of EDA would provide a powerful means for the soluble protein to signal through high valency receptor clustering. In line with this hypothesis, we found that a naturally occurring point mutation (G207R) in the collagen domain completely abolished the bundle effect. It is, however, likely that the collagen domain also serves additional functions; a number of families with XLHED displayed in frame deletion of 2 or 4 GlyXY repeats in the predicted bundle domain of the collagen triple helix, i.e. before the interruption in the GlyXY repeats. Deletions of 2 GlyXY repeats can also be found C-terminal to the interruption. Surprisingly, the activity of recombinant proteins containing these types of deletions was indistinguishable from wild type, at least in the model systems utilized. The deletions may specifically affect multimerization of the collagen domain under in vivo conditions. Alternatively, the collagen domain may have additional functions, e.g.interaction with other proteins. It is well known for C1q that the collagen domain interacts with the serine proteases C1r and C1s to form C1, the first component of the serum complement system, and with a number of other proteins, including membrane-bound receptors (22Eggleton P. Reid K.B. Tenner A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 428-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Further investigations are required to understand the molecular mechanism underlying loss of function of EDA in these particular deletion mutants. 15 families with XLHED displayed 5 distinct mutations in the furin consensus recognition sequences of EDA, demonstrating an important functional role for this 7-aa sequence. The release of soluble EDA upon proteolytic processing is an expected event, as mRNAs for EDA and EDAR are not expressed in adjacent cells but rather in spatially distinct tissues, at least in the developing tooth (10Tucker A.S. Headon D.J. Schneider P. Ferguson B.M. Overbeek P. Tschopp J. Sharpe P.T. Development. 2000; 127: 4691-4700PubMed Google Scholar). EDA contains two overlapping furin recognition sequences (RVRR and RNKR spanning aa 153–156 and 156–159, respectively). Because Arg156 is part of both sequences, it is hardly surprising that mutation R156C completely abolished EDA processing. Mutation R153C also affected the cleavage of EDA, but in a less dramatic manner. Although this mutation destroys only one of the two furin sites, this must be sufficiently disturbing to prevent efficient release of EDA from the cells naturally expressing it. These cells may express low amounts of furin or furin isoforms whose specificity may extend further than the canonical tetrapeptide recognition sequence. However, as mutations affecting the first furin domain invariably yield Cys residues, and as these Cys residues appear to form novel disulfide bridges, it is possible that this novel structural constraint prevents proper recognition of the remaining intact furin site. It also clearly appears from this study that, beside the furin cleavage sites, there are no alternative sites for solubilization of EDA. In particular, the sequence RRER (aa 69–72) and the basic motives KNKK and KGKK (aa 171–174 and 175–178) were not cleaved in our expression system. The latter two motifs are encoded in the small exon 4 and are also found in the sequences of Tweak and APRIL.

MMP-9 is historically referred to as gelatinase B because of its ability to cleave gelatin, a denatured form of collagen, in vitro. Along with MMP-2, MMP-9 differs from other MMPs because it contains three fibronectin type II repeats that have high binding affinity for collagen. These repeats are thought to mediate the binding of MMP-2 and -9 to collagen (1Stocker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W.

This binding interaction brings the catalytic pocket of the MMP in proximity to collagen, thereby enhancing its rate of hydrolysis. Despite these well characterized biochemical interactions, it is now clear that MMP-9 is also able to cleave a number of other proteins and may have a rather wide range of physiologic substrates (4Senior R.M.

Much of our understanding of the biological function of MMP-9 comes from the study of mice lacking this gene. For example, MMP-9-deficient mice have impaired ossification of the skeletal growth plate, a defect that has been partially attributed to poor vascularization of developing bone (9Vu T.H.

Studies on these mice also show that MMP-9 is essential for the recruitment of osteoclasts into developing bones (10Engsig M.T. Chen Q.J. Vu T.H. Pedersen A.C. Therkidsen B. Lund L.R. Henriksen K.

Other work indicates that MMP-9-deficient mice are resistant to dermal blistering in a bullous pemphigoid model, an effect that has been attributed to the inability of these mice to cleave the SERPIN α1-proteinase inhibitor (5Liu Z.

Finally, recent studies in the RIP1-Tag2 transgenic mouse model of multistage carcinogenesis indicate that MMP-9 is part of the angiogenic “switch” that is essential for tumor growth (11Bergers G. Brekken R. Mcmahon G. Vu T.H. Itoh T. Tamaki K. Tanzawa K. Thorpe P. Itohara S. Werb Z. Hanahan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2284) Google Scholar, 12Coussens L.M.

Nevertheless, a detailed understanding of subsite preferences for MMP-9 is lacking. Such an analysis is particularly important because the catalytic cleft of MMP-9 is closely related to other MMPs, raising questions about the distinction among substrates for these proteases. These issues are particularly important because many of the current pharmacologic antagonists of the MMPs have overlapping inhibition profiles. Furthermore, in the post-genomic era, where the sequences of all proteins will soon be available, information on substrate recognition could help identify important physiologic substrates. With these ideas in mind, we applied an unbiased approach to define the substrate recognition preference of MMP-9. MMP-9 was used to cleave substrates within a vastly complex phage display library of random hexamers. Substrates within this library can be cleaved at any position within the hexamer, allowing information on the substrate specificity on both sides of the scissile bond to be obtained. Three families of substrates were identified. The largest group contains a Pro-X-X-Hy-(Ser/Thr) motif (X is any residue, and Hy is a hydrophobic residue) that occupies positions P3 through P2′. This general motif is cleaved by a number of MMPs and is presumed to represent a collagen-like substrate (18Lauer-Fields J.L. Tuzinski K.A. Shimokawa K. Nagase H. Fields G.B. J. Biol.

The second group of substrates are defined by a Gly-Leu-(Lys/Arg) motif at positions P1 through P2′. Members of the third family of substrates are unique in that they contain Arg residues at both P1 and P2. Altogether, these findings reveal multiple modes of substrate recognition by MMP-9 and provide important insights into the hydrolysis of physiologic substrates that may be important in biology and pathology.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions containing MMP-9 were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 10 mm NaCl. The dialyzed material was then purified further using a 1-ml Hi-Trap Source Q ion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions containing MMP-9 were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 and then concentrated in a dialysis bag using Aquacide II (Calbiochem). The final concentration of purified material was typically 1.5–3 mg/ml. The purified catalytic domain of MMP-9 was activated by incubation with 2 mm APMA for 16 h at room temperature (29O'Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J. Eaton D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation was monitored by altered migration of the protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and zymography. Pro-MMP-13 was activated with APMA for 3 h at room temperature, and MMP-7 required no activation. The level of active protease was always quantified by active site titration prior to kinetic studies. The active site of MMP-9 was titrated using the hydroxamate inhibitor Ilomastat (30Galardy R.E. Cassabonne M.E. Giese C. Gilbert J.H. Lapierre F. Lopez H. Schaefer M.E. Stack R. Sullivan M. Summers B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 nm MMP-9 was incubated with a range of Ilomastat. Inhibition of MMP-9 by Ilomastat was then measured by determining the rate of cleavage of three concentrations of the peptide, m1A11, using the fluorescamine incorporation assay (21Netzel-Arnett S. Fields G.B. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6747-6755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fields G.B. Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6221-6226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active sites of MMP-13 and MMP-7 were titrated with human TIMP-2. Briefly, 5–15 nm of each protease were pre-incubated with a range of TIMP-2 for 5 h at room temperature. Residual MMP-13 activity was measured by cleavage of MCA-Pro-Cha-Gly-Nva-His-Ala-Dpa-NH2(Calbiochem) as substrate, and residual MMP-7 activity was measured by cleavage of MCA-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2(Calbiochem) with monitoring at λex 320 nm and λem 405 nm. The substrate phage library (2 × 1010 phage) was incubated with 2.5 μg/ml MMP-9 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35, and 0.05% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. A control selection was performed without protease. The cleaved phage were separated from the non-cleaved phage by immunodepletion. 100 μg of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was added to the phage samples and then incubated for 18 h with rocking at 4 °C. The phage-antibody complexes were precipitated by the addition of 100 μl of Pansorbin (Calbiochem). The cleaved phage remaining in the supernatant were amplified using K91 E. coli as described previously (32Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol.

Hydrolysis of individual phage substrates was measured using a modified ELISA. 96-well microtiter plates were coated with anti-M13 antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 2.5 μg/ml), in phosphate-buffered saline, overnight at 4 °C. After coating, the wells were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBS-T (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 10 mg/ml BSA. After blocking, 150 μl of supernatant from an overnight phage culture was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C to allow for phage capture. Unbound phage were removed with three washes of ice-cold TBS-T. To asses hydrolysis, MMP-9 (2.5 μg/ml) was added to the appropriate wells in Incubation Buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% BSA, 0.05% Brij-35, 50 μm ZnCl2) for 2 h at 37 °C. Control wells lacked protease. The protease solution was removed, and the wells were washed four times with ice-cold TBS-T. To measure hydrolysis of the peptides on phage by MMP-9, anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (1.8 μg/ml in TBS-T with 1 mg/ml BSA) was added to each well and the plates were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Binding of anti-FLAG antibody to FLAG epitope was measured with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Bio-Rad) followed by detection at 490 nm. The extent of hydrolysis, taken as a measure of substrate hydrolysis, was calculated by the ratio of the optical density at 490 nm of the protease-treated samples versussamples lacking protease. The cleavage site for MMP-9 within peptide substrates was determined using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. MMP-9 (25 nm) was incubated with 100 μm amounts of each peptide, independently, in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2 for 2 h at 37 °C. The mass of the cleavage products was determined using a Voyager DE-RP MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Following hydrolysis, the peptide samples were prepared according to methods described previously (35Karas M. Biochem. Soc.

Briefly, MMP-9, MMP-7, or MMP-13 were incubated with individual peptide substrates at concentrations ranging from 100 to 800 μm in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 50 μmZnCl2. At selected time points, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 1,10-phenanthroline. Peptide hydrolysis was determined by the addition of fluorescamine followed by detection at λex 355 nm and λem 460 nm. The data were transformed to double-reciprocal plots (1/[S] versus1/vi) to determine Km andkcat (21Netzel-Arnett S. Fields G.B. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol.

For some substrates,Km and kcat could not be determined individually, but the specificity constant,kcat / Km, was derived by the equation: kcat/Km =vi/(E0)(S0) (22Netzel-Arnett S. Sang Q.X.

The terminology established by Schechter and Berger is used to describe the subsites in the protease active site and the correlating positions in substrates (40Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4766) Google Scholar). This method describes the former as a set of subsites designated as S (S1, S2, etc.) and the latter as P (P1, P2, etc.). The primed sites are to the carboxyl-terminal and unprimed sites are to the amino-terminal side of the scissile bond. The x-ray structure of MMP-9 has not been reported to date. We have previously reported a computational three-dimensional model for the catalytic domain of MMP-9, which was generated by homology modeling taking advantage of sequence alignment and conservation of secondary structural elements (41Olson M.W. Bernardo M.M. Pietila M. Gervasi D.C. Toth M. Kotra L.P. Massova I. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol.

Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). This model shows high sequence and three-dimensional homology to the structure of MMP-2 (42Massova I. Fridman R. Mobashery S. J. Mol. Model. 1997; 3: 17-30Crossref Google Scholar), and it indicates an extended cleft for binding of substrate that can accommodate at least six amino acids from the substrate. We considered molecular models for representative members of each class of substrates (peptide A10 and peptide C11), but we concluded that there is not sufficient sequence information for the group II substrates to draw meaningful conclusions. Therefore, the modeling work was concentrated on groups I and III. The molecular models of the sequences flanking the sites of MMP-9 cleavage in clones A10 and C11 (Ac-SGPLFYSVTA-NH2 and Ac-SGRRLIHHTA-NH2, respectively) were constructed using the SYBYL molecular modeling program and were docked into the active site of MMP-9 (42Massova I. Fridman R. Mobashery S. J. Mol. Model. 1997; 3: 17-30Crossref Google Scholar). Each enzyme-substrate complex contained the hydrolytic water molecule positioned in the active site near the Glu-402 side chain, the general base that promotes it for the hydrolytic reaction. The enzyme-substrate complexes were energy-minimized using the AMBER 5.0 software package (44Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III, T.E. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M.

The library comprises 2.4 × 108 independent transformants, giving a 75% confidence that each of the 6.4 × 107 possible random hexamer sequences are represented in the library. Sequencing of phage confirmed the randomness of the hexamer insert. Under the selection conditions, greater than 95% of phage could be immunodepleted using an anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown). Optimal substrates were selected by exposing the phage library to a recombinant form of the catalytic domain of MMP-9 expressed in HEK 293 cells (29O'Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J. Eaton D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant catalytic domain of MMP-9 was purified on gelatin-Sepharose, followed by ion exchange chromatography (29O'Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J. Eaton D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protease was activated with 2 mm APMA for 16 h at room temperature, and the active site was titrated with the hydroxamate inhibitor Ilomastat (29O'Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J.

Following three rounds of exposure to MMP-9, individual phage clones were selected for sequencing. An alignment of the motifs revealed three groups of structurally distinct substrates (TableI). Substrates in group I contain the motif with sequence Pro-X-X-Hy-(Ser/Thr). Further analysis shows that, within this larger motif, Arg is favored at P2 and Ser/Thr is favored at P1 (consensus motif noted in Table I). Substrates in group II contain a Gly-Leu-(Lys/Arg) motif. Interestingly, both groups I and II are related to substrates that have been described previously for other MMPs and are somewhat related to sites of cleavage in collagen (21Netzel-Arnett S.

We have proposed that this is a physiological pathway (part of the “fight or flight” response) that regulates excitation-contraction coupling and specifically increases excitation-contraction coupling gain by increasing the amount of Ca2+ released for a given trigger (2Marx S.O.

Protein kinase A-hyperphosphorylated RyR2 channels in failing hearts are depleted of FKBP12.6 and exhibit single-channel properties (2Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D.

A motif that can bind FKBP12 was suggested by studies that identified the ideal substrate for prolyl isomerization (13Albers M.W. Walsh C.T. Schreiber S.L. J. Org.

Chem. 1990; 55: 4984-4986Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar) concluded that FKBP12 was binding to a twisted-amide transition state intermediate in the peptidyl-prolyl bond of its substrates. They subsequently showed that FK506 and rapamycin, immunosuppressant drugs that bind to FKBP12, are twisted amide surrogates. The binding of FKBP12 to the hydrophobic motif identified as the optimal substrate for peptidyl-prolyl isomerization present in the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (an intracellular Ca2+ release channel with structural homology to RyR channels) was examined subsequently using a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen (14Cameron A.M. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Fung E.T. Livingston D.J. Aldape R.A. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27582-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The present study is the first to establish the precise location of an FKBP12 binding site on the intact full-length RyR1 channel. We show that Val2461 is a key residue mediating FKBP12 binding to RyR1 and that mutations at this site that inhibit FKBP12 binding to RyR1 result in significant defects in single-channel function, which is consistent with altered channel gating because of the absence of FKBP12. To demonstrate that the defects in single-channel properties are caused by lack of FKBP12 binding as opposed to some other structural change in the channel, we generated a mutant V2461I RyR1 channel that does not bind FKBP12 but does bind FKBP12.6. Addition of FKBP12.6 to the V2461I mutant RyR1 restores normal channel function. Mutagenesis of RyR1 was performed using a cassette containing nucleotides 6597–11766. The sequences of the primers used for mutagenesis (including conservative substitutions to generate new restriction sites) were as follows: V2461H, c cgc gcc atc ctt cgc agt ctt cat ccc ctg gac gac c; V2461E, c ctt cgc tcc ctc gag ccc ctg gac gac c; V2461G, c ctt cgc tcc ctc ggg ccc ctg gac gac c; and V2461I, cc atc ctt cgc tca tta att ccc ctg gac gac c. The Morph site-specific plasmid DNA mutagenesis kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Boulder, CO) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The corresponding mutant fragments were digested withNsiI and SapI (at nucleotides 7453 and 7647, respectively) and subcloned into an expression vector (pCMV5) containing a full-length RyR1 clone cut with the same enzymes. HEK293 cells were maintained in T175 flasks in minimum Eagle's media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and were passed every 3–4 days. One T175 flask (50% confluent) was transfected with 20.0 μg of DNA using the Ca2+ phosphate precipitation method. Forty-eight h post-transfection, the cells were washed twice, scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. After resuspending the pellet in 0.5 ml of 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitors (complete EDTA-free inhibitors from Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the cells were allowed to swell for 30 min on ice before lysis by 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Cell homogenates were diluted with an equal volume of ice-cold medium containing 500 mm sucrose and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were recovered and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. Pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 250 mmsucrose, and the protein concentration of the microsomes was determined by Bradford assay. Aliquots were stored at −80 °C. Approximately 200 μg of wild-type or mutant RyR1 containing microsomes were diluted to a total of 500 μl with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mmEDTA, 1.0 mm NaF, 1.0 mmNa3VO4, and 0.25% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors. These samples were incubated with 2.0 μl of anti-RyR antibody for 1 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (1:1 in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h at 4 °C. After the beads were washed four times for 5 min in immunoprecipitation buffer, the proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, heated to 95 °C for 4 min, and assayed for both RyR and FKBP by Western analysis. Recombinant RyR1 microsomes were washed in 0.5 ml of 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitors and were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. Pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 300 mm sucrose, and 0.9% NaCl. Microsomes (200 μg) were added to 0.2 ml of imidazole buffer (5 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and 0.3 m sucrose) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with varying concentrations of rapamycin. Samples were centrifuged at 95,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected. Pellets were washed two times in 0.2 ml of imidazole buffer and centrifuged at 95,000 × g for 10 min. The final pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of imidazole buffer. Both the pellet and supernatant were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed for FKBP12 by Western blotting. Recombinant RyR1 containing microsomes was resuspended in 250 μl of imidazole buffer (5 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and 0.3m sucrose) and incubated with 5 μmrecombinant FKBP12.6 for 4 h at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 95,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellets were washed twice and resuspended in 500 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer. RyR1 was immunoprecipitated from these samples as described above. Single-channel experiments were conducted under voltage-clamp conditions. Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were added to the cis chamber and induced to fuse with planar lipid bilayers composed from 3:1 phosphatidyl ethanolamine/phosphatidyl serine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL). The bilayer cup was made of polystyrene with a 0.15-mm aperture. Fusion was promoted by KCl added to the cis chamber. After incorporation of a single Ca2+ release channel, the KCl gradient was eliminated by perfusion of the cis chamber withcis solution. Solutions used for channel analysis were as follows: trans solution, 250 mm Hepes, 53 mm Ca(OH)2, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.35; andcis solution, 250 mm HEPES, 125 mmTris, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmCaCl2, pH 7.35. Free Ca2+ concentration was determined using the program CHELATOR (15Schoenmakers T.J. Visser G.J. Flik G. Theuvenet A.P. BioTechniques. 1992; 12 (, 876–879): 870-874PubMed Google Scholar). The transchamber was connected to the head-stage input of an Axon 200 amplifier (Axon Instruments) using a silver/AgCl electrode and agar/KCl bridge. The cis chamber was held at ground with a similar electrode. The single-channel currents were filtered at 1 kHz with an 8-pole Bessel filter (Warner Instruments) and digitized at 4 kHz. Data were collected on a Pentium computer using AxoScope1 (Axon Instruments) and a Digidata 1200 (Axon Instruments) interface. The pClamp 6 program (Axon Instruments) was used for analyzing single-channel data. Open probability and the lifetime of open events and gating frequency were identified by 50% threshold analysis using at least 2 min of continuous record. The Student's t test was used for statistical analyses. To identify determinants for the binding of FKBP12 to the RyR1 channel we generated four mutant forms of the 5037-amino acid RyR1 channel subunit. In each case we introduced substitutions for Val2461, which is in the immediately N-terminal position relative to Pro2462 (referred to as the P1 position) predicted to form a binding site for FKBP12 on RyR1 (2Marx S.O.

The choice of amino acids to substitute for Val2461 was guided by data showing that the P1 amino acid strongly influences the catalytic efficiency for cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerization by FKBP12 of synthetic peptide substrates (13Albers M.W. Walsh C.T. Schreiber S.L. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 4984-4986Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Phe, and Val) in the P1 position resulted in the highest catalytic efficiency, whereas charged residues (His and Glu) reduced the catalytic efficiency, and Gly exhibited the lowest catalytic efficiency (13Albers M.W. Walsh C.T. Schreiber S.L. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 4984-4986Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore we generated four mutant forms of RyR1, V2461G, V2461E, V2461H, and V2461I (Fig. 1 A). Wild-type and mutant RyR1 were expressed in HEK293 cells (which contain endogenous FKBP12). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to determine whether FKBP12 was associated physically with the recombinant wild-type and mutant RyR1 as we had demonstrated previously for native RyR1 (16Jayaraman T. Brillantes A.-M.B. Timerman A.P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Fleischer S. Tempst P. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9474-9477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for recombinant RyR1 expressed in Sf9 cells (3Brillantes A.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasova E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Landers M. Ehrlich B.E. Marks A.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). FKBP12 co-immunoprecipitated with the recombinant wild-type RyR1 and with the V2461H mutant but not with the V2461G, V2461E, or V2461I mutant forms of RyR1 (Fig. 1 B). These data identify the P1 residue Val2461 as being critical in determining the binding of FKBP12 to RyR1. FKBP12 can be competed off from RyR1 using the immunosuppressant drugs FK506 or rapamycin at nanomolar concentrations (3Brillantes A.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasova E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Landers M. Ehrlich B.E. Marks A.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in which membranes containing recombinant wild-type or mutant RyR1 were isolated from transfected HEK293 cells, centrifuged, and assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/immunoblotting to determine whether FKBP12 is bound to RyR1 (in the pellet, P, Fig. 1 C). Treatment of the membranes with rapamycin dissociates RyR1-bound FKBP12 so that it appears in the supernatant,S. Compared with wild type RyR1, rapamycin sensitivity of the V2461H mutant channel was increased ∼10-fold. Rapamycin competed FKBP12 off from the V2461H mutant channel at a concentration of 10 nm, and complete removal of FKBP12 was achieved with 100 nm compared with 1000 nm for the wild-type channel (Fig. 1 C). The V2461E, V2461G, and V2461I mutant RyR1 channels did not bind FKBP12 in this assay (data not shown), which is in agreement with the co-immunoprecipitation experiments. To analyze the functional consequences of reduced affinity for FKBP12 in the mutant RyR1 channels, the single-channel properties of recombinant proteins were examined in planar lipid bilayers (TableI). One of the prominent features of RyR1 expressed in the absence of FKBP12 is an increase in the gating frequency compared with native RyR1 or wild-type RyR1 channels co-expressed with FKBP12 (3Brillantes A.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasova E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Landers M. Ehrlich B.E. Marks A.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The wild-type recombinant RyR1 channel expressed in HEK293 cells (which contain endogenous FKBP12) exhibited the same single-channel properties (n = 11,e.g. Fig. 2 A and Table I) as reported previously for native RyR1 and for wild-type RyR1 co-expressed with FKBP12 in Sf9 cells (3Brillantes A.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasova E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Landers M. Ehrlich B.E. Marks A.R.

Ser. 1996; 51: 29-45PubMed Google Scholar). The V2461H mutant RyR1 channel that binds FKBP12 but with reduced affinity (Fig.1 C) also exhibited normal single-channel properties (n = 9, e.g. Fig. 2 B and TableI). However, the V2461E mutant RyR1 channel did exhibit a significant increase in the gating frequency (n = 21,e.g. Fig. 2 C and Table I) as did the V2461G mutant RyR1 (n = 16, e.g. Fig. 2 Dand Table I). This rank order of the appearance of increased gating frequency in the mutant RyR1 channels correlates with the increased affinity of FKBP12 for substrates with Val in the P1 position compared with those with His, Glu, or Gly. The amplitude histograms for the V2461E (Fig. 2 C), V2461G (Fig. 2 D), and V2461I (Fig. 4 C) mutant RyR1 channels suggest that these mutant channels exhibit partial openings or subconductance states as reported previously for RyR1 expressed in the absence of FKBP12 (3Brillantes A.B.

However, given the increased gating frequency of these mutant channels and the time resolution of our recording system (∼1 ms), we are not able to resolve the five discrete states (closed, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, fully open) reported previously (3Brillantes A.B.

The open dwell times, gating frequency, and open probability of the wild-type RyR1 and mutant V2461H channels were similar (Table I). In contrast, the open dwell times were significantly shorter, and the gating frequency was significantly higher for the V2461E and V2461G mutant channels compared with the wild-type channel (Table I). These data indicate that the V2461E and V2461G mutant channels are less stable in the open or closed states as suggested previously for RyR1 channels expressed in the absence of FKBP12 (3Brillantes A.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasova E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Landers M. Ehrlich B.E. Marks A.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the observed changes in single-channel function in the RyR1 mutants that do not bind FKBP12 is that the substituted amino acids cause structural changes in the channel that result in altered function independent of FKBP12 binding. To address this possibility specifically we designed a mutant RyR1 (V2461I) that does not bind FKBP12 but does bind FKBP12.6 and therefore could be “rescued” by the addition of FKBP12.6. The ability to restore normal function to the mutant RyR1 channel would exclude the possibility that the amino acid substitutions themselves cause the observed changes in channel function independent of FKBP12 binding. Using co-immunoprecipitations, we showed that the V2461I mutant RyR1 (expressed in HEK293 cells that contain FKBP12 but not FKBP12.6) binds FKBP12.6 (Fig. 3) but not FKBP12 (Fig.1 B). When the V2461I mutant channel was examined in planar lipid bilayers, it exhibited the same increased gating frequency as the V2461G mutant RyR1 (Fig. 4 B). However, when FKBP12.6 was added to the RyR1 V2461I mutant, normal channel function comparable with that of the wild-type RyR1 was restored (Fig. 4 D). In contrast, the addition of FKBP12 to the V2461I mutant RyR1 channel failed to restore normal channel function (Fig. 4 C). The mechanism whereby FKBP12 catalyzes thecis-trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds is to bind to and lower the energy of the unstable twisted-amide transition state intermediate (18Rosen M.K. Standaert R.F. Galat A. Nakatsuka M. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1990; 248: 863-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). FKBP12 also may bind to the twisted-amide transition state intermediate of a peptidyl-prolyl bond on RyR1. Stabilization of an unstable bond may be part of the mechanism whereby binding of FKBP12 allows the RyR1 channel to assume a conformation that permits optimal gating (3Brillantes A.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasova E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Landers M. Ehrlich B.E. Marks A.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) as well as coupled gating between neighboring channels (4Marx S.O. Ondrias K. Marks A.R. Science. 1998; 281: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). As such, this would be a novel role for an immunophilin and would imply that steric constraints hinder the complete isomerization of the peptidyl-prolyl bond to either fullycis or trans conformations. This is because the affinity of FKBP12 for either the cis or transconformation of the peptidyl-prolyl bond would be reduced, whereas evidence suggests that in vivo FKBP12 is bound tightly to RyR1. Because the interaction between FKBP12 and RyR1 likely involves the catalytic site of the enzyme, tight in vivo binding to the substrate would not be consistent with RyR1-bound FKBP12 functioning as a true enzyme. The results for the binding of FKBP12 to V2461H, V2461E, and V2461G mutant RyR1 channels correlate precisely with the increased affinity of FKBP12 for substrates with a hydrophobic residue at the P1 position Gly (13Albers M.W. Walsh C.T. Schreiber S.L. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 4984-4986Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar); however, the lack of FKBP12 binding to the V2461I mutant RyR1 diverges from this model. Interestingly, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of FKBP12-catalyzed reactions for peptide substrates in which the amino acid residue at the P1 position is varied is 7-fold higher for substrates with Val (wild type) at the P1 position compared with His, 37-fold higher compared with Glu, and 41-fold higher compared with Gly (13Albers M.W. Walsh C.T. Schreiber S.L. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 4984-4986Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This rank order of efficiency of the FKBP12-catalyzed isomerization of peptide substrates has been used to support the idea that stabilization of the twisted-amide intermediate is the mechanism of amide rotation by FKBP12 (18Rosen M.K. Standaert R.F. Galat A. Nakatsuka M. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1990; 248: 863-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Because the rank order of the catalytic efficiency of FKBP12 correlates with the binding of FKBP12 to the wild-type and three of the four mutant RyR1 channels FKBP12 (Fig.1), the mechanism by which FKBP12 modulates RyR1 channel gating may involve binding to and stabilization of a twisted-amide transition state intermediate of a peptidyl-prolyl bond in RyR1. However, the finding that FKBP12 does not bind to the V2461I mutant RyR1 would seem to cast some doubt on this interpretation. Compared with peptides with Gly at the P1 position, the catalytic efficiency of FKBP12-catalyzed reactions was 3-fold higher when the P1 residue was a Leu and 2-fold higher when the P1 residue was an Ile (13Albers M.W. Walsh C.T. Schreiber S.L. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 4984-4986Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Among the other channels and receptors known to bind FKBP12, three contain a Leu (inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors 1 and 2 and TβRI) at the P1 position and one (RyR2) has an Ile at the P1 position. The finding that the V2461I mutant RyR1 channel does not bind FKBP12 was not predicted on the basis of examining the catalytic efficiency of FKBP12 because the enzyme isomerizes a synthetic peptide with Ile in the P1 position more efficiently than one with Val (13Albers M.W. Walsh C.T. Schreiber S.L. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 4984-4986Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Our data show that FKBP12.6 binds with high affinity to the V2461I mutant RyR1 just as it binds to the wild-type RyR2 channel that has an Ile in the corresponding P1 position (Fig. 1 A). The binding of FKBP12.6 but not FKBP12 to the V2461I RyR1 mutant could be explained if the catalytic sites formed by hydrophobic pockets were slightly different in size such that FKBP12.6 accepted the side chain of an Ile, whereas FKBP12 does not. An alternative explanation would be that it is not the catalytic site of FKBP12/12.6 that binds to the residue at position 2461 in RyR1, leaving open the possibility that the catalytic site is interacting with another peptidyl-prolyl bond in the channel. The structure of FKBP12 bound to the type 1 transforming growth factor β receptor shows that the P1 residue and the Pro in the FKBP12 binding site do not interact with FKBP12. However, this report also notes that there are other contact sites between FKBP12 and transforming growth factor β receptor (19Huse M. Chen Y.G. Massague J. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1999; 96: 425-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The data in the present study suggest that the FKBP12 binding site on RyR1 may have a significantly different structure from that on the transforming growth factor β receptor because mutations of the P1 residue strongly influence binding of FKBP12 but also does not exclude the possibility that other residues in RyR1 (and by inference in RyR2) besides the P1 residue participate in FKBP12/12.6 binding to the channels. Rather, the present study establishes the critical role of Val2461 in FKBP12 binding. Single-channel data showing defects in mutant RyR1 channels that do not bind FKBP12 are consistent with data from RyR1 channels expressed in Sf9 cells that lack FKBP12 (3Brillantes A.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasova E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Landers M. Ehrlich B.E. Marks A.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) and RyR1 channels from the FKBP12 knockout mouse that exhibited similar single-channel defects (20Shou W. Aghdasi B. Armstrong D.L. Guo Q. Bao S. Charng M.J. Mathews L.M. Schneider M.D. Hamilton S.L. Matzuk M.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In addition to the effects on single-channel properties noted above, a role for FKBP12 in coupled gating between neighboring RyR1 channels has been proposed (4Marx S.O. Ondrias K. Marks A.R. Science. 1998; 281: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). One model for how FKBP12 can influence gating of individual channels is that each of the subunits of RyR1 contribute a pore through the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, and FKBP12 stabilizes the channel in a conformation that permits the four subunits of the channel to gate simultaneously (21Marks A.R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 631-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). To explain how FKBP12 can also influence coupled gating between channels, the model would have to include stabilization of a conformational state that enhances interactions between neighboring channels (21Marks A.R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 631-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The present study supports the concept that FKBP12 binding to RyR1 stabilizes the channel in a favorable conformation. As such, this is a novel mechanism for regulating ion channel gating. The substitution of Gly for Val2461 at the P1 position would be expected to introduce significantly increased flexibility around the peptidyl-prolyl bond at this position because of the small size of Gly. Increased flexibility around the Gly-Pro bond might destabilize the channel contributing to the reduction in dwell times and the corresponding increase in gating frequency exhibited by the V2461G mutant RyR1 channels. The demonstration that FKBP12.6 can restore normal function to the V2461I mutant channel excludes the possibility that the observed defects in single-channel function are caused by the amino acid substitution independent of whether FKBP12 is bound to the channel. Taken together our data indicate that Val2461 is a critical determinant of FKBP12 binding to RyR1, which is required for normal channel function. However, these data do not exclude the possibility that there are other contact sites between FKBP12 and RyR1 and other residues in RyR1 that also are required for binding of FKBP12 to the channel.

Even though NF-κB-responsive genes are known to orchestrate stress-like responses, critical gaps in our knowledge remain about the global effects of NF-κB activation on cellular physiology. DNA microarrays were used to compare gene expression programs in a model system of 70Z/3 murine pre-B cellsversus their IKK signaling-defective 1.3E2 variant with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-1 (IL-1), or a combination of LPS + phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate under brief (2 h) or long term (12 h) stimulation. 70Z/3-1.3E2 cells lack expression of NEMO/IKKγ/IKKAP-1/FIP-3, an essential positive effector of the IKK complex. Some stimulated hits were known NF-κB target genes, but remarkably, the vast majority of the up-modulated genes and an unexpected class of repressed genes were all novel targets of this signaling pathway, encoding transcription factors, receptors, extracellular ligands, and intracellular signaling factors. Thirteen stimulated (B-ATF, Pim-2, MyD118,Pea-15/MAT1, CD82, CD40L,Wnt10a, Notch 1, R-ras,Rgs-16, PAC-1, ISG15, andCD36) and five repressed (CCR2,VpreB, λ5, SLPI, andCMAP/Cystatin7) genes, respectively, were bona fide NF-κB targets by virtue of their response to a transdominant IκBαSR (super repressor). MyD118 andISG15, although directly induced by LPS stimulation, were unaffected by IL-1, revealing the existence of direct NF-κB target genes, which are not co-induced by the LPS and IL-1 Toll-like receptors. The IκB kinase (IKK) signaling complex is responsible for activating NF-κB-dependent gene expression programs. Even though NF-κB-responsive genes are known to orchestrate stress-like responses, critical gaps in our knowledge remain about the global effects of NF-κB activation on cellular physiology.

A variety of extracellular and endogenous stimuli, including viral and bacterial infections, oxidative and DNA-damaging agents, hyperosmotic shock, chemotherapeutics, and pro-inflammatory cytokines all result in NF-κB activation (1Baldwin Jr., A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5552) Google Scholar, 3Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 4Barkett M.

NF-κB factors bind to DNA as heterodimers assembled from five known proteins (RelA, c-Rel, RelB, p50, and p52) with each subunit contacting one-half of a conserved 10-base pair consensus motif (GGGRNWTYCC) (1Baldwin Jr., A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5552) Google Scholar, 5Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar). NF-κB is generally held in an inactive state, tethered in the cytoplasm to inhibitory factors termed inhibitors of NF-κB (IκBs)1 (1Baldwin Jr., A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5552) Google Scholar, 5Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar). Activators of NF-κB cause the specific phosphorylation of pairs of amino-terminal serines in the IκBs, which mark them for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal destruction. NF-κB then becomes available to activate its nuclear target genes (1Baldwin Jr., A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5552) Google Scholar, 5Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar). IκB phosphorylation is mediated by a high molecular weight signalsome complex comprising at least two direct IκB kinases (IKKα and IKKβ, also called IKK1/CHUK and IKK2) and a regulatory, docking/adapter protein (NEMO, NF-κBessential modulator, also called IKKγ/IKKAP-1/FIP-3) (reviewed in Refs. 3Mercurio F.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). IKKα and IKKβ are atypical serine/threonine kinases possessing an amino-terminal catalytic domain and two carboxyl-proximal interaction motifs resembling leucine zipper and helix-loop-helix domains (7Connelly M.A. Marcu K.B.

The essential role of the IKK signalsome in NF-κB activation has been demonstrated in mice lacking IKKβ or IKKα (13Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M.

Loss of NEMO in cultured cells resulted in a complete lack of signal-induced NF-κB activation (19Courtois G. Whiteside S.T. Sibley C.H. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell.

More importantly, murine embryos that were genetically null for NEMO, akin to IKKβ KO mice, succumbed to severe liver apoptosis due to a virtually complete block in NF-κB activation (23Rudolph D. Wen-Chen Y. Wakeham A. Rudolph B. Nallainathan D. Potter J. Elia A.J. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 854-862PubMed Google Scholar). Major issues about the IKK signaling pathway remain unexplored, including the short versus long term effects of NF-κB activation to program cellular gene expression on a genomic scale. Because NF-κB regulates a variety of ubiquitous and cell-type-specific gene products in different cellular contexts, we elaborated the signal-induced, NEMO-dependent gene expression program in the context of the 70Z/3 murine pre-B lymphoma line. 70Z/3 pre-B cells recapitulate aspects of the pre-B to immature B cell transition in response to NF-κB activation (24Paige C.J. Kincade P.W. Ralph P. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 641-647PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sakaguchi N. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. Watanabe T. Yoshida N. Shimizu A. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Honjo T. Yamamura Y. J.

In response to LPS, they uniformly differentiate into an immature B lymphocyte-like state by activating the transcription of a pre-rearranged κ-light-chain allele (24Paige C.J. Kincade P.W. Ralph P. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 641-647PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sakaguchi N. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. Watanabe T. Yoshida N. Shimizu A. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Honjo T. Yamamura Y. J.

Chem. 1983; 258: 5027-5033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By employing immunoselection against surface-bound IgM, Mains and Sibley (28Mains P.E. Sibley C.H. Somat. Cell Genet. 1983; 9: 699-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) isolated spontaneously arising mutants of 70Z/3 that were completely unresponsive to LPS treatment, failing to express κ light chains (28Mains P.E. Sibley C.H. Somat. Cell Genet. 1983; 9: 699-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29Weeks R.S. Sibley C.H. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1987; 13: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Molecular and biochemical analyses subsequently revealed that the 70Z/3-1.3E2 variant was defective in a crucial NF-κB signaling step, making the cells refractory to all NF-κB-activating stimuli, with the exception of anti-oxidant-insensitive pathways and the HTLV-Tax-1 gene product (19Courtois G. Whiteside S.T. Sibley C.H. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Yamaoka et al. (22Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar) showed that, unlike the 70Z/3 parental line, the 70Z/3-1.3E2 variant lacked NEMO protein expression but their wild type phenotype was rescued by NEMO. With high density oligonucleotide arrays, we have performed a genomic analysis of signal-induced, NEMO-dependent NF-κB induction in 70Z/3versus 1.3E2 cells. A large number of novel induced and repressed NEMO/IKK target genes were revealed. Experiments with an IκBα(SS/AA) super repressor revealed that many of these genes are novel and direct targets of NF-κB. 70Z/3 and 70Z/3-1.3E2 cells (19Courtois G. Whiteside S.T. Sibley C.H. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Weeks R.S. Sibley C.H. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1987; 13: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and CH12-IκBαAA1A2 cells (30Hsing Y. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2804-2811PubMed Google Scholar) were routinely cultured in growth media consisting of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 50 μmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Stimulations to activate the IKK signalsome pathway in 70Z/3 and 70Z/3-1.3E2 cells were performed by supplementing growth media with 15 μg/ml LPS and 10 ng/ml PMA (both from Sigma Chemical Co.) for 12 h, or LPS alone for 2 or 12 h or 20 ng/ml recombinant murine IL-1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 or 12 h prior to isolating total cellular RNAs. In some experiments, cellular protein synthesis was inhibited by co-incubation with 100 μm anisomysin (Sigma) to block translational initiation. An IκBα(S32A/S36A) super repressor gene, with serines 32 and 36 mutated to alanines (a kind gift of Dr. Dean Ballard) (31Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was introduced into 70Z/3 cells by retroviral infection. Stably infected and neomycin- or puromycin-resistant populations of 70Z/3 cells (>1000 clones) were obtained after 12 days of selection in 800 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) or 1 μg/ml puromycin following infection with recombinant murine retroviruses harboring IκBα(S32A/S36A)-IRES-Neo or IκBα(S32A/S36A)-IRES-Puro expression cassettes. CH12-IκBαAA1A2 cells, a derivative of the CH12.LX line harboring a constitutively expressed LacI repressor and an IPTG-regulated IκBα(S32A/S36A) super-repressor, was maintained in growth media supplemented with 200 + 400 μg/ml hygromycin and Geneticin, respectively (30Hsing Y. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2804-2811PubMed Google Scholar). After inducing their transfected IκBα(S32A/S36A) gene with 200 μm IPTG for 24 h (30Hsing Y. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2804-2811PubMed Google Scholar), cells were stimulated for 2 h with 2.7 μg/ml plasma membranes from Sf21 insect cells, which had been stably infected with a murine CD40L-expressing recombinant baculovirus (32Kehry M.R. Castle B.E. Semin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNAs were extracted from 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 cells with Triazol reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Poly(A)+ RNAs were isolated from total RNAs of unstimulated and LPS+PMA-stimulated cells with Oligotex (Qiagen). Purified RNAs were converted to double-stranded cDNA with a SuperScript kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) and an oligo-dT primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter (Genset). Biotin-labeled cRNAs were generated from the cDNA samples by an in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (Enzo kit, Enzo Diagnostics). The labeled cRNAs were fragmented to an average size of 35–200 bases by incubation at 94 °C for 35 min. Hybridization (16 h), washing, and staining protocols have been described previously (Affymetrix Gene Chip Expression Analysis technical manual (33Mahadevappa M. Warrington J.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1134-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar)). Affymetrix murine chips (mouse 11K set, subA and subB) were used for hybridization. Chips were stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes) and read with a Hewlett-Packard GeneArray scanner. DNA microarray chip data analysis was performed using GENECHIP 3.2 software (Affymetrix). The quantitation of each gene expression was obtained from the hybridization intensities of 20 perfectly matched and mismatched control probe pairs (34Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar). The average of the differences (perfectly matched minus mismatched) for each gene-specific probe family was calculated. The software computes a variety of different parameters to determine if an RNA molecule is present or absent (Absolute Call) and whether each transcript's expression level has changed between the baseline and experimental samples (Difference Call). In this work, all chip files were scaled to a uniform intensity value (1500) for all probe sets. For a comparative chip file (such as stimulated Wt. versus stimulated Mut.), the experimental file (stimulated Wt.) was compared with the baseline file (stimulated Mut.). To minimize false positives, the following criteria were selected for significant changes for each primary screen: 1) the change in the average difference across all probe sets was >3-fold; 2) for induced genes, a difference call of “increase” or “marginal increase” should be present, and an absolute call of “presence” should be associated with the experimental file; 3) for suppressed genes, a difference call of “decrease” or “marginal decrease” should be present, and an absolute call of “presence” should be associated with the baseline file. Hierarchical clustering was performed with the Cluster program (available at the Stanford Web site) as described previously (35Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13157) Google Scholar). Genes that showed >3-fold changes in at least two of the Wt.+/Mut.+ comparisons (i.e. IL-1, 2 h; IL-1, 12 h; LPS, 2 h; or LPS, 12 h) were subjected to clustering analysis for eight stimulated Wt. and Mut. samples (see Fig. 2). Genes that were detected as absent in all eight arrays were removed. The average difference values (representing the quantity of mRNA, see above) of the selected genes (360) were median-centered by subtracting the median-observed value, normalized by genes to the magnitude (sum of the squares of the values) of a row vector to 1.0. The normalized data were clustered through one cycle of K-means clustering (K = 5) and then further clustered by average linkage clustering analysis of Y axis (genes) using an uncentered correlation similarity metric, as described in the program Cluster. Average difference values of 50 or less were set to 50 before median centering and normalization. The clustered data were visualized by the program TreeView (available at the Stanford Web site). RT-PCRs were performed as previously described (36McKenzie F.R. Connelly M.A. Balzarano D. Muller J.R. Geleziunas R. Marcu K.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2635-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To establish their relative qualities, serial dilutions of cDNAs were amplified withβ-actin and GAPDH-specific primers for internal standardization. Similarly, linear response ranges were determined for each gene to semi-quantify their levels of expression as a function of LPS stimulation in 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 mutant cells. The sizes of PCR products corresponded to those expected for each gene. PCR primer pairs were 22- to 24-mers, and their nucleotide sequences are available from the authors upon request. TaqMan Real-time quantitative PCR is based on a fluorogenic 5′-nuclease assay (37Livak K.J. Flood S.J. Marmaro J. Giusti W. Deetz K. PCR Methods Appl. 1995; 4: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). The same total RNA samples that were used to prepare probes for microarray hybridization were treated with Dnase I followed by RNeasy Mini protocol for RNA cleanup (Qiagen). The TaqMan probe consists of an oligonucleotide with a 5′-reporter dye (FAM) and a 3′-quencher dye (TAMRA). To measure the gene copy numbers of the target transcript, cloned plasmid DNA or mouse genomic DNA was serially diluted and used to produce a standard curve as described elsewhere (38Li X. Wang X. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 2000; 5: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Data from TaqMan PCR analyses were normalized based on mRNA copy numbers of GAPDH using the TaqMan rodentGAPDH control reagents (Applied Biosystems). The 70Z/3 pre-B line (Wt.) and its 1.3E2 NF-κB signaling-defective mutant (Mut.) were initially exposed to a combination of 15 μg/ml LPS and 100 ng/ml PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13- acetate) for ∼12 h (equivalent to one to two cell generations) to simulate a condition of long term, constitutive NF-κB activation. Employing DNA microarrays of 11,800 known cellular genes and expressed sequence tags (Affymetrix Mu11KsubA and Mu11KsubB Arrays), 1.3% of genes displayed greater than 3-fold increases whereas 0.9% revealed greater than 3-fold decreases in expression in comparisons of 12-h stimulated 70Z/3 wild type versus 1.3E2 mutant cells. Independent microarray screenings of both Wt. and Mut. cells that were either unstimulated or stimulated by 15 μg/ml LPS or 20 ng/ml IL-1 were also performed. Genes affected 3-fold or more in the primary screening (Wt.+/Mut.+, 12-h LPS+PMA) were confirmed in a 12-h LPS screen with only occasional variations. The -fold changes of these selected hits in various comparisons between Wt. and Mut. stimulated and unstimulated cells were visualized as a two-color image (Fig.1). Most hits were also confirmed in independent microarray screens of stimulations for 12 h with IL-1 or LPS (Fig. 1), indicating that the different stimuli (LPS+PMA, LPS, and IL-1) regulate these genes by a common mechanism. Given that IKK/NF-κB activation mediated by LPS, PMA, and IL-1 are all defective in the NEMO null 1.3E2 line, genes identified in the primary Wt.+ versus Mut.+ screens should represent direct and indirect targets of the IKK/NF-κB pathway, provided that IKK/NF-κB-independent NEMO signaling pathways do not exist. Even though NEMO/IKKγ has been clearly established to function as an essential non-catalytic component of the IKK complex in vivo, this physiological role need not constitute its only cellular raison d'être. Because the IKK/NF-κB pathway is latent in unstimulated cells, similar IKK/NF-κB-dependent gene expression changes in stimulated versus unstimulated 70Z/3 Wt. cells would be anticipated. Consistently, the majority of the up-regulated and repressed genes identified in the Wt.+/Mut.+, LPS+PMA comparison in Fig. 1 were also identified in another microarray screen comparing 12-h LPS+PMA stimulated to unstimulated 70Z/3 wild type cells (see Wt.+/Wt.−, LPS+PMA in Fig. 1). As expected, genes affected in the Wt.+ versus Wt.− screen were not observed in a Mut.+versus Mut.− screen (see Fig. 1). However, a fraction of the genes identified in the primary Wt.+ versus Mut.+ screen were inversely affected in the Mut.+ versus Mut.− screen (i.e. stimulated genes being repressed and repressed genes being stimulated) (see Fig. 1). The results indicate that these latter genes can only be effected by extracellular signals in the absence of NEMO or NF-κB but not in the presence of NEMO or NF-κB. We classified the novel target genes into eight functional categories in Tables I and II. To ensure that genes identified in the primary Wt.+versus Mut.+ screens have a higher probability of belonging to the IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway and not to an unknown, NEMO-dependent, IKK-independent pathway, we employed an additional selection criteria to assemble the relevant genes. Thus, all genes exhibiting inverse Mut.+ versus Mut.− effects of 2-fold or more in at least two independent screens were filtered out of Tables I and II. Table I displays the known genes identified by the initial screen of 70Z/3 Wt.versus 1.3E2 Mut. cells stimulated with LPS+PMA for 12 h. In addition to co-stimulating with LPS and PMA for 12 h, we also performed chip screens of cells stimulated with LPS or IL-1 alone for 2 and 12 h. Most genes that were identified by the additional screenings are the same as those identified by the initial LPS+PMA screen (Table I). Table II displays genes that were revealed by the 2-h LPS, 2-h IL-1, and 12-h IL-1 screens, which were not modulated more than 3-fold in the primary 12-h LPS+PMA screen. Genes such as Etl-1, TNF-α,Bcl-2, N-myc, PAC-1, PLA2, and 2B4 were only affected in the 2-h stimulation time (Table II). Genes presented in Tables I and II also showed minimal expression changes in a subsequent screen of Wt.− versusMut.− cells (Fig. 1 and Tables I and II), providing additional confidence that the activated IKK pathway targets them. Taken together, these results are consistent with most of the genes in Tables I and IIbeing co-dependent on NEMO and the IKKs to activate the NF-κB signaling pathway.Table IIKK/NEMO-regulated genes are listed in order of their fold changes in 12 h LPS + PMA stimulated (+) 70Z/3 Wt. versus 1.3E2 Mut. cellsGenes and descriptionsLPS + PMAWt−/Mut− unstim.LPSIL-1Wt+/Mut+ (12 h)Wt+/Wt− (12 h)Mut+/Mut− (12 h)Wt+/Mut+ (2 h)Wt+/Mut+ (12 h)Wt+/Mut+ (2 h)Wt+/Mut+ (12 h)AutoregulationU36277IκBα (2 hits)25.6101.62.79.17.14.92.8M83380RelB transcription factor6.64.81.7−1.45.22.83.73AA14443Nuclear factor NF-kappaB p100 subunit (2 hits)6.56.12.53.15.45.92.73.7Growth and developmentDifferentiation/cell fateAF01702B-ATF transcription factor (2 hits)10.85.2−1.81.26.414.55.22.9X54149MyD118 (GADD-like/myeloid differentiation primary response)9.112.52.21.812.312.41.81.8aa27119Mouse Notch 1 (embryonic cell fate mediator)5.9−1.1−2.42.617.15.913.112.1U61969Wnt10a42.71.21.84.34.45.22.2L38971Integral membrane protein 23.92−1.11.512.39.611.710.458636Lef-1 (lymphoid enhancer binding factor) (2 hits)−3.9−12−1.41.9−2−3.2−1.4−1.1Growth arrest and apoptosisD14883KAI1/CD82 (tetraspan transmembrane protein, tumor suppressor)3.941.51.56.59.94.94.1M21828Gas2 (growth-arrest-protein)−3.4−2.31.61.3−1.6−3.3−1.3−1.4Proliferation and survivalL41495Pim-2 (serine/threonine kinase) (2 hits)46.238.6−1.7−1.626.235.220.111.4AA108330Pea-15/Mat-1 (mammary transforming gene)5.94.81.62.411.312.97.512x63027Mammary tumor virus locus 434.13.2−1.6−1.32.37.621.9AA050733GILZ/TSC22 (glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper)−5.2−2.13.6−1.3−5.1−10.5−2.4−5.6Signal transduction/cell cycleU06924STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription)8.15.8−1.11.8−1.48.94.7−2.9AA011731Pip5k2α (phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase IIα)6.94.1−1.6−1.66.310.6−2.55.2Z14249MAPK/ERK-1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase)5.93.7−1.21.73.132.11.8W41501R-ras52.9−1.91.55.94.85.98.2u94828Rgs16 (regulator of G-protein signaling)4.31.11.42.98.52.43.84.2I38444T-cell-specific GTPase4.23.81.5−1.82.84.21.82.5m83749Cyclin D24−1.5−1.52.89.36.39.416.9AA013648ler5 (Immediate early response 5)3.18.31.4−1.63.82.11.12.3M90388Ptpn8/70zpep (non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase) (2 hits)−5.6−2.81.7−1.2−2.6−4.3−2.6−2W10739Rgs2 (regulator of G-protein signaling)−3.5−2.521.5−2.1−6.11−1.7aa184871Mkp-3 (dual specificity protein phosphatase)−3.2−2.6−1.7−2.2−4.9−5−2.7−1.8C78795Ccnd3 (mouse cyclin D3) (2 hits)−3.1−1.6−1.1−2.1−4.3−3−2.1−2.4Environmental stress/immune responsesx56602UCRP/ISG15 (interferon-induced 15-kDa protein)36.636.1−1.6−121.815.13.3−1.6ET61599Igκ (immunoglobulin kappa light chain) (19 hits)25.114.4−1.5−1.532.821.512.633w12941Mouse analogue of rat interferon-inducible protein147.9−2.1−1.25.9152.41.1AF028725Mirf5 (mouse interferon regulatory factor 5)11.46.5−1.4−1.38.28.24.44.9C77421OxyR/Y-box protein 3 (redox-dependent transcription factor)8.39.21−1.21.73.31.61.2M83312CD40 ligand85.3−1.2−2.529.111.511.18.8ET62172IgH (immunoglobulin heavy chain) (5 hits)7.66.7−1.3−1.8516.76.74.4M17122C4b complement binding protein7.43.8−1.31.16.86.85.84.5L23108CD36 antigen (2 hits)7.34.81.2−1.134.72725.511.3Y08026Immunity associated protein 384.32.2−1.11.46.14.23.94.3x96639Exostoses (multiple) 13.91.5−1.41.73.22.45.12.3AA051446Cerebellar degeneration-associated antigen3.72.42.53.51.43.11.83.1U72519Evl (Ena-vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein)3.7−1.11.62.821.4412.416.4AA118715CD97/leukocyte antigen/DAF interactor−7.8−1.63.2−1.4−1.2−4.3−8.4−3.4x53825CD24a (heat-stable antigen)−6.1−8.5−1.9−1.8−3.5−4.3−3.4−2.3U69488G7e (viral envelope-like protein)−5.5−2.41.8−1−5.7−11.1−4.9−6Kinesis/secretion/inflammatory responsesu02298Scya5 (RANTES chemokine)41.121.81.4−1.221.950.7−1.62.5u16985Lymphotoxin-beta28.919.91.83.533.619.212.113.4X12531MIP-1/Scya3 (macrophage inflammatory protein)28105.9−1.2−3.88.28.24.12.4L31580CCR7/EBI-1 (chemokine receptor 7)27.27−1.62.11118.84.93.3AF013114EBI-3 (cytokine receptor-like molecule) (2 hits)11.46.91.7−1.328.511.319.315L06039pecam1 (platelet endothelial c"

This seems to be the case for AF1/tau1, the major transactivation domain of the human glucocorticoid receptor. We show here that in buffers containing the natural osmolyte trimethylamineN-oxide (TMAO), recombinant AF1 folds into more a compact structure, as evidenced by altered fluorescence emission, circular dichroism spectra, and ultracentrifugal analysis. This conformational transition is cooperative, a characteristic of proteins folding to natural structures. The structure resulting from incubation in TMAO causes the peptide to resist proteolysis by trypsin, chymotrypsin, endoproteinase Arg-C and endoproteinase Gluc-C. Ultracentrifugation studies indicate that AF1/tau1 exists as a monomer in aqueous solution and that the presence of TMAO does not lead to oligomerization or aggregation. It has been suggested that recombinant AF1 binds both the ubiquitous coactivator CBP and the TATA box-binding protein, TBP. Interactions with both of these are greatly enhanced in the presence of TMAO. Co-immunoadsorption experiments indicate that in TMAO each of these and the coactivator SRC-1 are found complexed with AF1. These data indicate that TMAO induces a conformation in AF1/tau1 that is important for its interaction with certain co-regulatory proteins.

Numerous mutational analyses have shown that of these, AF1/tau1 makes by far the largest quantitative contribution to transcriptional activation. Deletion or inactivating mutations of AF1/tau1 reduce the ability of the GR to activate transcription from test genes by at least 60–70% (1Dahlman-Wright K. Almlof T. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.A.

As defined by molecular genetic analyses, tau2 and AF2 are located in the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the receptor, whereas AF1/tau1 lies N-terminal from the centrally located DNA-binding domain (DBD). In the human GR (hGR) AF1 is encompassed by amino acids 77–262 (3Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Precisely how the AF1/tau1 transactivation region functions is unknown, in part due to lack of knowledge of its working structure; yet this structure must provide the basis for essential, specific interactions with other proteins. Studies undertaken in our laboratory and others (4Dahlman-Wright K. Baumannm H. McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.A. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Baskakov I.V. Kumar R. Srinivasan G. Ji Y. Bolen D.W. Thompson E.B. J. Biol.

Instead it appears to exist as a collection of conformers that overall appears as random coil. However, in the presence of the strong α-helix stabilizing agent trifluoroethanol, as many as three segments toward the C-terminal end of the AF1/tau1 region exhibit α-helical characteristics (4Dahlman-Wright K. Baumannm H. McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.A. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Mutations in the GR tau1/AF1 transactivation region coupled with assays of function have suggested that this ability to form α-helical conformation in vitrocorrelates with the transactivation potential of the region (4Dahlman-Wright K. Baumannm H. McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.A. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The subdomain of AF1/tau1 that subsumes the potential helices has been referred to as the AF1 core (AF1c), and when this core is expressed separately while connected to an exogenous DNA-binding domain, AF1 retains considerable transactivating activity. Mutations of acidic amino acids in AF1, including the core, had little effect on such activity; however, mutations altering several hydrophobic residues of AF1/tau1 significantly diminished its transcriptional activation potential (6Almlof T. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9586-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In recent years, a number of proteins that modulate GR activity, such as GRIP1, RIP140, SRC-1, and CBP/p300, have been identified (7McKenna J. Lanz B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar, 8Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). These co-regulators bind the GR and presumably act as molecular bridges to the primary transcriptional machinery. Most co-regulators have been identified through their ligand-dependent interactions with the LBD, in particular, with the AF2 domain in members of the receptor family of which the GR is part (10McEwan I.J.

Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the co-regulators function exclusively through this part of the GR or whether they can also modulate the activity of AF1/tau1. Some may well do so. CBP and several other co-regulators have been shown to bind, if not strongly, to recombinant AF1/tau1 (15Henriksson A. Almlof T. Ford J. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Ford J. McEwan I.J. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.A. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15014-15018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A recent study using AF1c or the potential helices thereof connected to a GR DNA-binding domain could interact in a yeast system with a fragment of CBP to activate appropriate promoter-reporter constructs (17Warnmark A. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15014-15018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). AF1 has also been shown to bind TBP (16Ford J. McEwan I.J. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1175-1465Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the critical TATA box-binding protein that forms the basis for the multiprotein transcription initiation complex. This raises the possibility that the AF1 GR domain somehow directly influences the transcription machinery. In vitro transcription studies indicated that the holoGR acts to stabilize the preinitiation complex (18Tsai S.Y. Srinivasan G. Allan G.F. Thompson E.B. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17055-17061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One possibility is that a structured conformation of AF1/tau1 is induced or stabilized during its interaction with specific target proteins. This model in fact has been supported for the activation domains of some transcription factors (19Mc Ewan I.J. Dahlman-Wright K. Ford J. Wright A.P.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9584-9593Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,20Shen F. Triezenberg S.J. Hensley P. Porter D. Knutson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4827-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, data short of actual structural proof support the idea that conditional folding of the AF1/tau1 region is an important requirement for its interaction with target factors and subsequent role in gene regulation. In vivo, the particular conformer of AF1/tau1 required for transcriptional activation presumably is induced or stabilized by forces coming from intra- and inter-molecular interactions. Knowledge of those factors and the conformation adopted by AF1/tau1 will lead to understanding of the role of this region in the transcription process, information essential to understanding how glucocorticoids affect gene regulation. Naturally occurring solutes or organic osmolytes have been used to shift the thermodynamic balance so as to make unstructured proteins fold into native-like, functioning structures (21Back J.F.

Bolen D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9268-9273Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). One such osmolyte, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), has been used very successfully to fold unstructured, inactive proteins into proteins with significant functional activity (27Baskakov I.V. Bolen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4831-4834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 28Baskakov I.V. Bolen D.W. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2666-2673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that TMAO induces secondary and tertiary structure in a GR fragment containing the entire N terminus plus the DBD (amino acids 1–500). The conformational transition of this GR fragment is cooperative in nature (5Baskakov I.V. Kumar R. Srinivasan G. Ji Y. Bolen D.W. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10693-10696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), a condition characteristic of proteins folding to their proper shape. Because most of the structural changes taking place in this GR fragment appear to be happening in the N-terminal domain, we hypothesize that TMAO induces an ordered conformation in the AF1/tau1 region, and this conformation is important for its interaction with target proteins. In this paper, we present studies of the TMAO-induced conformation in the AF1/tau1 region expressed alone. Our data suggest that TMAO induces secondary and tertiary structure in the AF1/tau1 region, and this induced conformation greatly enhances its interaction with certain co-regulatory proteins and TBP. Construction and expression of AF1/tau1 has been described (5Baskakov I.V. Kumar R. Srinivasan G. Ji Y. Bolen D.W. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10693-10696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The bacteria containing the recombinant vector for GST-AF1/tau1 were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) for 3 h, lysed, and extracted. The bacterial extracts were loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose column at 4 °C. AF1/tau1 protein was eluted from the column by thrombin digestion, followed by a Superdex-75 exclusion column as described (5Baskakov I.V. Kumar R. Srinivasan G. Ji Y. Bolen D.W. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10693-10696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For GST adsorption experiments, GST or GST-tagged protein was purified by eluting the bound protein using 50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mmreduced glutathione, pH 8.3. Protein purity was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 and was estimated to be greater than 95%. Fluorescence emission spectra of purified AF1/tau1 protein in solution were recorded at various concentrations of TMAO. The spectra were monitored using a Spex Fluoro Max spectrofluorimeter at excitation wavelengths of 278 or 295 nm as described (5Baskakov I.V. Kumar R. Srinivasan G. Ji Y. Bolen D.W. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10693-10696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). All measurements were made in 1-cm rectangular cuvettes thermostated at 22 °C, and all the data were corrected for the contribution of the solute concentrations. To prevent aggregation of protein we added proline at a constant molar ratio of TMAO:proline as 4:1 in all samples containing TMAO. The CD spectra were recorded at 22 °C on an Aviv 62 spectropolarimeter using a 1.0-cm quartz cell, with the bandwidth of 1.0 nm and scan step of 0.5 nm. The spectra were recorded at a protein concentration of 1.0 mg/ml (in the presence and absence of TMAO) in 10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9, and were corrected for the contribution of solute concentrations. Each spectrum shown is a result of five spectra accumulated, averaged, and smoothed. Sequencing grade trypsin, chymotrypsin, endoproteinase Gluc-C, and endoproteinase Arg-C were used for proteolytic digestions. Digestion was carried out with 5 μg of purified AF1/tau1 in 10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9. Except for Endo Arg-C, which was carried out at room temperature for 50 min, all other reactions were carried out at 4 °C for 20 min. Endo Gluc-C and Endo Arg-C were added at a protein:enzyme mass ratio of 50:1, whereas trypsin and chymotrypsin were added at 100:1. Reactions were terminated by adding SDS loading buffer and then placing the sample tubes in a boiling water bath. The samples were then run on SDS-PAGE gel and stained by Coomassie Blue R-250. For protein microsequencing, the proteolytic reactions were carried out in triplicate in the presence and absence of 3 m TMAO. After gel electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes. The largest protected bands in the samples containing 3 m TMAO were pooled and sequenced by five cycles of Edman degradation (29Matsudaria P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sedimentation was carried out with a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge, using a two-channel Epon centerpiece. Purified AF1/tau1 protein was sedimented in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9. Rotor speed was 60,000 rpm with scans taken at 280 nm. The apparent sedimentation coefficient distribution was determined using the time derivative of the concentration profile (30Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) as modified by J. Philo (DCCT+, version 1.11). Standard protocols (31Van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1971: 98-121Google Scholar) were used to correct apparent sedimentation coefficient (s*) to 20 °C and water (s20,w). The s* values were corrected for viscosity, which was measured for buffer with and without 3 m TMAO, using a viscometer. For sedimentation equilibrium studies the samples were run at 20,000, 25,000, and 30,000 rpm. The samples were judged to be at equilibrium when successive scans showed no change in the distribution of protein. Data were analyzed using nonlinear least squares parameter estimation using the program NONLIN (32Johnson M.L. Fraiser S.C. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 33Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Holvorson H.R. Biophys.

Purified GST-AF1 hybrid protein in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.9, with or without TMAO was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa cells and added (1.0 mg/ml) to the GST-AF1 bound to the beads, and the mixture was further incubated for 2 h. Any unbound protein was washed thoroughly. The appropriate concentrations of TMAO were kept throughout the assay. To the washed beads, SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and the sample was boiled for 5 min in a water bath. Each sample was then run on a SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. To confirm CBP binding, CBP was constitutively expressed in COS-1 cells using transient transfection as described (34Chen H. Srinivasan G. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25873-25880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and this COS-1 cell extract was used in place of HeLa nuclear extracts. All other adsorptions were carried out using HeLa nuclear extracts. After gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membrane was first blocked by incubation for 2 h at room temperature in PBS containing 10% nonfat milk proteins and then incubated at 4 °C with appropriate antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight. The immunoreactive bands were developed using ECL method and visualized by autoradiography. Purified AF1/tau1 and HeLa nuclear proteins were mixed together in a buffer containing 10 mmTris, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.9 (with or without 3 mTMAO), to a final volume of 1 ml and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. 5 μl of antibodies (SRC-1, CBP, or TBP; Santa Cruz) and 25 μl of protein-agarose conjugate were then added and incubated further for 2 h. Pellets were collected by centrifugation and washed thoroughly. The beads were resuspended in SDS buffer and boiled for 5 min. After SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane and immunoblotted using an antibody raised against amino acids 150–175 of the human GR as described above. As with other related receptors, the GR contains several major functional domains. These are shown diagrammatically for the human GR in Fig.1. The AF1/tau1 transactivation region, amino acids 77–262 is highlighted, with vertical lines above the bar indicating the location of the two Tyr and one Trp residues within AF1/tau1. This domain was expressed in a bacterial system as a hybrid protein tagged at the N-terminal residue with glutathione S-transferase (GST). After removing the GST moiety, we studied the folding of the AF1/tau1 protein. Fluorescence emission was used to monitor the environment around the Trp and Tyr residues. The fluorescence emission spectra of >95% pure recombinant AF1/tau1 are presented in Fig. 2. Fig.2 a shows the spectra in the absence and presence of 3.5m TMAO after excitation at 278 nm, which reflect the changes coming both from Tyr and Trp residues. Fig. 2 bindicates the fluorescence emission changes after excitation at 295 nm, which specifically follows changes in the environment of the single Trp residue located between the first two potential helices of the AF1 core. In both sets of spectra, the quantum yield of the fluorescence is increased in the presence of TMAO, with an increase of about 2-fold at 3.5 m TMAO. There are blue shifts in the emission maxima in the presence of TMAO. These fluorescence changes are typical of those accompanying the removal of aromatic residues from polar, aqueous solution into a more hydrophobic environment within the protein. Both the increase in quantum yield and the blue shift in fluorescence maxima indicate the formation of compact structure in the presence of TMAO. Because the three amino acids excited are located well apart in AF1/tau1, the conformational changes reflected in the fluorescence emission changes may be happening throughout the peptide. TMAO induces this conformational transition in AF1/tau1 in a cooperative manner, as shown by monitoring the shift in fluorescence emission maximum after excitation at 278 nm as a function of TMAO concentration (Fig.2 c). These observations strongly suggest that TMAO folds AF1/tau1 region into a more compact structure, and the cooperativity of the process is a hallmark of native protein folding (35Baldwin R.L.

The spectra in low salt were recorded in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 10 mmNaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9. Those ofd–f were recorded in the same buffer except with 200 mm NaCl. The linear least squares best fit of experimental data to the two-state model of protein folding/denaturation using linear extrapolation methods (42Santro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar) gives apparent thermodynamic parameters of TMAO-induced folding: ΔG = −2.8 ± 1.1 kcal/mol, m = 1.1 ± 0.6 in 10 mm NaCl, and ΔG = −3.9 ± 0.7 kcal/mol, m = 1.6 ± 0.3 in 200 mm NaCl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the ultracentrifugation studies (discussed below) required a buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, we repeated the fluorescence emission spectra in this buffer to find out whether the structural changes we observed in AF1/tau1 following TMAO exposure occurred at this salt concentration. In Fig. 2, (d and e) the quantum yield of the fluorescence is increased significantly following TMAO exposure, as was seen in Fig. 2 (a and b). Interestingly, the blue shift in emission maxima at 295 nm is significantly increased compared with that at low salt (Fig. 2,b versus e), indicating that higher salt concentration favors the conformational transition of folding of AF1/tau1 by TMAO. The TMAO-induced conformational transition in AF1/tau1 in 200 mm salt also is cooperative (Fig.2 f) and reaches saturation at 3 m compared with that of 3.5 m in 10 mm salt (Fig.2 c). These fluorescence emission studies thus indicate that the TMAO-induced cooperative conformational transition in AF1/tau1 is more favored at 200 mm. The fluorescence emission spectra of AF1/tau1 in the presence and absence of TMAO suggest that TMAO causes tertiary structure to form in this protein. To acquire further evidence for tertiary structure occurring in AF1/tau1, we recorded the near-UV CD spectra of this protein in the presence and absence of TMAO (Fig.3). Comparison of the spectra shows that in the presence of TMAO, the maximum at around 290 nm is significantly increased, reflecting perturbation of the Trp residue. These data support the conclusion that TMAO causes three-dimensional structure to occur in the domain. As another way of evaluating the changes in the tertiary structure of the AF1/tau1 region brought about by TMAO, we carried out limited proteolytic digestions of the protein with four different proteases in the presence and absence of the osmolyte. To be sure that the compound was not interfering with enzyme activity, we first tested trypsin activity on the artificial substrate,Nα-benzoyl-l-argininep-nitroanilide. Tryptic activity was not blocked by TMAO. In fact, proteolysis of the test substrate was somewhat enhanced, perhaps due to the osmolyte preserving the natural active conformation of the enzyme (data not shown). The patterns of proteolytic products of AF1/tau1 after digestion by trypsin and chymotrypsin are shown in Fig.4 a. It is evident that the partial cleavage patterns vary as the concentration of TMAO increases. At 0 and 0.5 m TMAO, the protein is nearly completely digested by both proteases (lanes 3 and 4, and9 and 10), whereas it is partially protected at 1 and 1.5 m TMAO (lanes 5 and 6 andlanes 11 and 12). At 2 m or higher TMAO concentrations, AF1/tau1 appears to be mostly protected, suggesting that it has folded into a tertiary structure that moves the residues attacked by these enzymes to positions not easily reached by them. Similar results were obtained when AF1/tau1 was digested with the proteases Endo Gluc-C and Endo Arg-C (Fig.4 b), although in the case of Endo Gluc-C, the protection was not as complete. In the case of Endo Arg-C, full protection was seen only at 3 m TMAO. We compared the peptide patterns resulting from digestion of heat-denatured and non-denatured AF1/tau1, to see whether the non-denatured form contained folded regions resistant to peptidases. The data (not shown) indicated no difference in patterns, consistent with lack of significant structure in native recombinant AF1/tau1. We then compared the peptide patterns of the folded forms induced by TMAO. Upon exposure to each of the four proteases, both non-denatured and denatured AF1/tau1 show closely similar protected digestion patterns after incubation in the presence of 3 m TMAO for 15 min up to 16 h (data not shown). The similar patterns of protected peptides at every time point in the presence of 3 m TMAO demonstrate that TMAO can induce similar structures in AF1/tau1 whether it is initially non-denatured or denatured. Acute (15 min) TMAO exposure is enough to fold the recombinant protein domain into a tertiary structure not distinguishable, in this test, from that produced by the longest exposure. These observations suggest that once in a sufficient concentration of TMAO, AF1/tau1 folds rapidly to a protease-resistant shape and that it remains in this conformation, irrespective of the duration of TMAO exposure. Four of the most prominent protected bands seen after partial digestion of AF1 in the presence of 3 m TMAO were identified by sequencing their N termini. In Fig. 5 the positions of these bands in the AF1/tau1 domain are shown diagrammatically. A long region starting at the N terminus of AF1/tau1 was protected from digestion by trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Endo Gluc-C. Many potential substrate sites for these enzymes exist within that region. All three enzymes cut in a relatively short region lying approximately beyond amino acid 217. Although we did not identify them by sequencing as yet, the sizes of smaller peptides protected against these three enzymes suggest that in TMAO a relatively short segment of AF1/tau1 beyond amino acid 217 is open to attack. Peptide 4 was produced by Endo Arg-C, which has only two potential substrate sites in AF1/tau1. The protected site is Arg-214. This result is consistent with the interpretation that in the TMAO-folded portion, a short region beyond amino acid 217 is open to proteolysis. It is evident from these results that TMAO-induced structure in AF1/tau1 is not confined to only one part of the molecule. It is evident from our data that TMAO exposure apparently leads to the formation of a significant amount of secondary and tertiary structure in the AF1/tau1. The observed structural changes in the presence of 3 m TMAO might originate from an oligomerization of the protein induced by the presence of the co-solvent. Analytical sedimentation studies were conducted to monitor the effects of TMAO on the quaternary structure of t"

In addition, suppression of p38 MAPK activation by overexpression of a dominant negative p38 MAPK or MKK6 mutant did not diminish insulin-induced glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

The facilitative glucose transporter gene family encodes at least six isoforms (GLUT1–6) with varying tissue distributions, subcellular localizations, and kinetics for glucose uptake (1Burant C.F.

Among them, GLUT4, in which expression is strictly limited to muscle and fat cells, resides in an intracellular compartment under basal conditions and moves to the cell surface in response to stimulation by insulin and other factors. In contrast, the ubiquitously expressed GLUT1 is mainly located on the cell surface, irrespective of stimulation, and is thus considered to be mainly involved in the maintenance of basal glucose uptake into the cells. The mechanisms whereby signal-transducing molecules regulate the activity of glucose transporters have been extensively studied. At present, it is clear that activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is essential for insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane and increased glucose uptake (3Cheatham B.

Among the mitogenic factors and stress-inducing stimuli that mediate activation of these enzymes, insulin is reported to activate p38 MAPK (18Moxham C.M. Tabrizchi A. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol.

Interestingly, SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, inhibits insulin-stimulated increases in glucose transport in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes without affecting insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface (20Sweeney G.

It has therefore been hypothesized that p38 MAPK activation is involved in an insulin-induced enhancement of intrinsic GLUT4 activity on the cell surface.

To modulate p38 MAPK activity, dominant negative p38 MAPK and MAPK kinase (MKK) mutants as well as constitutively active MKK mutants were overexpressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes using an adenovirus-mediated transfection system. In addition, the effects induced by TNFα, IL-1β, and 200 mm sorbitol were examined in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We show that MKK6- and MMK3-mediated activation of p38 MAPK significantly alters expression of GLUT1 and GLUT4, increasing basal glucose transport and reducing insulin responsiveness. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 2-deoxy-d-glucose were purchased from Wako Bioproducts.

Thereafter, the cells were incubated for an additional 4–10 days in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum; the medium was changed every other day. With this protocol, more than 90% of the cells expressed the adipocyte phenotype (3Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell.

Assessing triglyceride content of the infected cells confirmed that overexpression of the MAPK family mutants did not affect differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes (data not shown). 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a 12-well tissue culture dishes were lysed, boiled in Laemmli buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Immunoblotting was performed using an ECL system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Adipocytes were serum-deprived for 3 h before being exposed to 100 nm insulin for 5 min. p38 MAPK activity was assayed using a specific kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with immobilized anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) antibody, and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-ATF2 (Thr71) antibody, a natural substrate of p38 MAPK. 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes in 24-well culture dishes were serum-starved for 3 h in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and then they were incubated for 45 min in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (in mm: 137 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 10 sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.5 MgCl2, and 1 CaCl2) (3Cheatham B.

Basal and stimulated uptake of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose was then measured as described previously (29Asano T. Takata K. Katagiri H. Tsukuda K. Lin J.L. Ishihara H. Inukai K. Hirano H. Yazaki Y. Oka Y.

Fractionation of subcellular membranes from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was carried out essentially as described previously (36Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of subcellular membrane fractions containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting using anti-GLUT1 and anti-GLUT4 antisera and an ECL detection system. Total cell RNA was isolated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes using an Isogen RNA isolation kit (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). RNA concentrations were estimated based on absorbance at 260 nm, and 10 μg of RNA from each sample were used for the RNase protection assay described below. Riboprobes were synthesized as described previously (37Anai M. Funaki M. Ogihara T. Terasaki J. Inukai K. Katagiri H. Fukushima Y. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To obtain mouse GLUT1 and GLUT4 cDNAs, polymerase chain reaction was performed based on the reported sequences using mouse cDNA libraries. The amplified fragments, which corresponded to nucleotides 790–939 of mouse GLUT1 cDNA and 790–946 of mouse GLUT4 cDNA, respectively, were subcloned into a TA vector. These resultant plasmids were then linearized withBamHI and HindIII, respectively, and used forin vitro transcription. RNase protection assays were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (RPA III; Ambion, Austin, TX). Pooled samples of 10 μg of total RNA from adipocytes were hybridized with the riboprobes for GLUT1 and GLUT4. After treatment with RNase, the protected fragments were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide-urea gels and subjected to autoradiography, and the band intensities were determined using a Molecular Imager GS-525. Results were expressed as means ± S.E. Comparisons were made using unpaired Student's ttest. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. LASDSE-MEK1, p38 MAPK-AF, AA-MKK6, EE-MKK6, EE-MKK3, and DED-MKK7 were overexpressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using an adenovirus transfection system (Fig. 1). Their respective levels of expression were 5-, 11-, 10-, 15-, 8-, and 8-fold greater than that in control cells overexpressing LacZ. Similar results were obtained with L6 myotubes (data not shown). p38 MAPK, which is activated by insulin-mediated dual phosphorylation on threonine 180 and tyrosine 182 in the TGY motif, phosphorylates a number of downstream targets, including ATF2. We overexpressed p38 MAPK-AF, AA-MKK6, EE-MKK6, and EE-MKK3 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, after which p38 MAPK activities were measured by immunoblotting anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) immunoprecipitates with anti-phospho-ATF2 (Thr71) antibody (Fig.2). As shown previously, insulin did indeed activate p38 MAPK in control 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing LacZ. By contrast, overexpression of EE-MKK6 led to marked activation of p38 MAPK irrespective of insulin stimulation, whereas overexpression of p38 MAPK-AF or AA-MKK6 strongly inhibited insulin-induced activation of p38 MAPK. EE-MKK3 also activated p38 MAPK; however, the magnitude of the enhancement was smaller than seen with EE-MKK6 (data not shown). Fig.3 A shows the basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxy[3H]glucose uptake into 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing LacZ or dominant negative p38 MAPK (p38-AF) and MKK6 (AA-MKK6) mutants. In each case, insulin markedly enhanced glucose uptake. Moreover, overexpression of either p38-AF or AA-MKK6 significantly enhanced the insulin-induced increases in glucose uptake, with the latter having the greater degree. Based on these results, it seems clear that p38 MAPK activation is not essential for insulin-induced increases in glucose uptake. On the other hand, overexpression of a constitutively active form of MKK6 (EE-MKK6) led to an ∼30-fold increase in glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes, even in the absence of insulin, and insulin stimulation further increased glucose uptake by ∼50% (Fig.3 B). Pretreatment for 15 min with 100 nm of wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, abolished the insulin-induced increase in glucose uptake by cells overexpressing either LacZ or EE-MKK6, although wortmannin had no effect on the increase in glucose uptake induced by EE-MKK6. As mentioned in the Introduction, there exist at least three MAPK pathways. To examine the roles of the respective MKK isoforms involved in these pathways, the effects of overexpressing constitutively active forms of MKK3 (EE-MKK3), MKK6 (EE-MKK6), MEK1 (LASDSE-MEK1), and MKK7 (DED-MKK7) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes were compared. Maximal overexpression of EE-MKK3, EE-MKK6, and LASDSE-MEK1 induced ∼3-, 30-, and 15-fold, respectively, increases in glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes, whereas DED-MKK7 had no effect on glucose transport (Fig.4 A). As reported previously, a membrane-targeted, constitutively active form of Akt (myr-Akt) also increased glucose transport in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes (Figs. 4, A andB). To understand better the mechanism underlying the increase in glucose transport induced by MKK6 and MEK1, subcellular fractionation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes was performed, and the GLUT1 and GLUT4 contents of the plasma membrane (PM) and low density microsome (LDM) fractions were analyzed. We found that EE-MKK6 and LASDSE-MEK1 markedly increased levels of GLUT1 protein in both the PM and LDM fractions (Fig.5, A and B), whereas levels of GLUT4 protein were markedly diminished (Fig. 5,C and D). By using an RNase protection assay, we found that, as compared with control (LacZ), expression of GLUT1 mRNA was significantly increased, whereas that of GLUT4 mRNA was significantly diminished in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing either EE-MKK6 or LASDSE-MEK1 (Fig.6). To confirm whether or not MKK6-induced changes in glucose transport and GLUT1/4 expression were mediated via p38 MAPK, the effects of SB203580, a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, were examined. As shown in Fig.7, SB203580 time-dependently inhibited the increase in glucose uptake induced by overexpression of EE-MKK6 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes; an almost complete blockade was achieved when cells were preincubated with SB203580 for 48 h. By contrast, preincubation with SB203580 had no significant effect on the increase in glucose uptake induced by overexpression of myr-Akt. Preincubation for 24 h with 10 μmSB203580 significantly inhibited the increase in glucose transport normally induced by overexpression of EE-MKK6 and EE-MKK3 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes but not that induced by LASDSE-MEK1 (Fig.8). Moreover, preincubation with SB203580 restored expression of both GLUT1 and GLUT4 protein to control levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing EE-MKK3 or EE-MKK6 (Fig.9). By contrast, the effects of overexpressing LASDSE-MEK1 on expression of GLUT1 and GLUT4 protein were unaffected by SB203580.Figure 9Effect of SB203580 on altered expression of glucose transporter isoforms. Total cellular protein prepared from 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing LacZ (control), EE-MKK3, EE-MKK6, LASDSE-MEK1, or EE-MKK7 were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-GLUT1 (A) or anti-GLUT4 (B) antiserum as a probe.

Such modulation has often been attributed to altered expression of one or more glucose transporter isoforms (i.e.GLUT1–6) (1Burant C.F. Sivitz W.I. Fukumoto H. Kayano T. Nagamatsu S. Seino S.

The current study was undertaken to understand better the role of MKK6/3-p38 MAPK activation on the regulation of glucose transport and glucose transporter expression. It was recently reported that treatment with SB203580, a specific p38 MAPK antagonist, inhibited insulin-induced glucose uptake by both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes, without inhibiting translocation of GLUT1 or GLUT4 (20Sweeney G.

Consequently, it was hypothesized that activation of p38 MAPK plays a key role in the insulin-induced enhancement of intrinsic GLUT4 activity on the cell surface. On the other hand, p38 MAPK is also known to be activated by stressful stimuli, such as TNFα, IL-1, and hyperosmotic shock (21Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L. Li X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

To clarify whether or not activation of p38 MAPK is indeed essential for insulin-induced increases in glucose transport, we overexpressed dominant negative p38 MAPK and MKK6 mutants, which markedly suppressed endogenous p38 MAPK activity but significantly enhanced insulin-induced glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We also observed that 10 μm SB203580 almost completely blocked insulin-induced activation of p38 MAPK but that the insulin-induced increase in glucose uptake was reduced by only 30% (data not shown). A higher concentration of SB203580 (100 μm) inhibited the insulin-induced increase in glucose uptake by more than 90%; however, at this concentration, SB203580 also significantly suppressed the activity of Akt kinase (data not shown). It therefore appears that the inhibition of insulin-induced increases in glucose uptake by SB203580 was not mediated by an effect on p38 MAPK activity but by an effect on some other molecule(s), perhaps Akt or GLUT4 itself. Furthermore, it appears unlikely that activation of p38 MAPK plays a significant role in the regulation of the insulin-induced increases in glucose transport mediated by GLUT4. We found that the overexpression of constitutively active MKK6 or MKK3 mutants markedly increased expression of GLUT1 protein in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes, whereas expression of GLUT4 was diminished. These effects were reflected by a significant increase in basal glucose transport and diminished insulin-induced glucose transport, respectively. That SB203580 inhibited MMK6/3-induced alterations in glucose uptake and expression of GLUT1/4 makes it highly likely that p38 MAPK plays a central role in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Most interesting, overexpression of constitutively active MEK1, which induces chronic activation of ERK, yielded the same result as did overexpression of constitutively active MKK6 and MKK3. Previously, up-regulation of GLUT1 by oncogenes fps, src, andras or by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate was shown to underlie the increased glucose transport related to cellular transformation and/or proliferation (10Birnbaum M.J. Haspel H.C. Rosen O.M. Science. 1987; 235: 1495-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 11Flier J.S. Mueckler M.M. Usher P. Lodish H.F. Science. 1987; 235: 1492-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). TheGLUT1 gene contains two enhancer elements as follows: one in the 5′ region contains one serum-response element, two 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-response elements (TREs), one cyclic AMP-response element, and three GC boxes; and the other, located in the second intron, contains one cyclic AMP-response element and two TREs (44Murakami T.

Both of these enhancers are involved in the augmented GLUT1 gene transcription induced by ras and v-src, by serum and by platelet-derived growth factor (11Flier J.S. Mueckler M.M. Usher P.

Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar), the association of activator protein-1 with TRE may contribute to the activation of the MEK1-ERK pathway by acting at the 5′ region enhancer(s) of the GLUT1 gene to up-regulate its expression and thus increase glucose transport. Indeed, this phenomenon may be central to the cellular transformation and/or proliferation mediated by activation MEK1-ERK pathway. MKK6/3 and MKK7 activate p38 MAPK and JNK, respectively (31Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and in the present study, we found that MKK6/3, but not MKK7, up-regulated expression of GLUT1 mRNA. Thus, the regulation of GLUT1 gene transcription may not be mediated entirely by activator protein-1 but by a more complex mechanism involving other factors. On the other hand, the GLUT4 gene, which contains 11 exons and 10 introns, possesses a promoter region containing a weak “TATA” box sequence homology, a CCAAT box to which CCAAT/enhancer binding protein likely binds (53Graves B.J. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Cell. 1986; 44: 565-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), four potential binding sites for nuclear transcription factor Sp1 (54Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), a skeletal muscle-specific activation domain (55Richardson J.M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21021-21027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these domains play a crucial role in the up-regulation of GLUT4 expression during adipose and muscle cell differentiation. In that respect, we found no significant alteration in cellular triglyceride content in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing the various MAPK family mutants studied; thus the down-regulation of GLUT4 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing constitutively active forms of MKK6/3 and MEK1 cannot be attributed to the dedifferentiation from adipocytes to fibroblasts. In many cases, expression of GLUT1 and GLUT4 are regulated oppositely, but whether changes in the expression of one affect the expression of the other remains unknown. If such interdependence exists, down-regulation of GLUT4 might be induced by the elevated intracellular glucose concentration mediated by up-regulation of GLUT1. However, there is reportedly no significant alteration in the GLUT4 expression in the skeletal muscle of transgenic mice overexpressing GLUT1 (56Hansen P.A. Wang W. Marshall B.A. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18173-18179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We therefore suggest that expression of GLUT1 and GLUT4 is regulated independently, although further study will be necessary to resolve this issue definitively. Several studies have shown that chronically exposing adipocytes to TNFα or oxidant stress markedly decreases their GLUT4 content as a result of decreasedGLUT4 gene transcription and a reduced half-life of its mRNA (26Qi C. Pekala P.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 223: 128-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Rudich A. Kozlovsky N. Potashnik R. Bashan N. Am. J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 21839-21845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that prolonged (24 h) exposure to TNFα, IL-1β, or hyperosmolarity increased glucose transport, increased GLUT1 expression, and decreased GLUT4 expression in a manner similar to that seen in cells overexpressing constitutively active MKK6. These phenomena were all attenuated by SB203580, implicating p38 MAPK in their occurrence. Exposure to TNFα, IL-1β, and hyperosmolarity is also known to lead to insulin resistance (24Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M.

Consistent with the aforementioned findings, down-regulation of GLUT4 and up-regulation of GLUT1 are considered to be components of the mechanism underlying such insulin resistance, although reduced expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 (61Stephens J.M. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 971-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and inhibition of insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor may also be involved in TNFα-induced insulin resistance (41Hansen L.L.

In summary, activation of the MKK6/3-p38 MAPK pathway markedly enhances glucose transport by up-regulating GLUT1 expression, irrespective of the stimulus. This effect may help cells meet the increased energetic demands incurred when they are under stress, perhaps determining whether cells survive or succumb to apoptosis, a process in which the MKK6/3-p38 MAPK pathway also plays a role. In addition, although further study will be required to clarify whether the MKK6/3-p38 MAPK pathway is indeed activated under conditions associated with insulin resistance (e.g. obesity), we anticipate that p38 MAPK activation will prove to be a key component of stress-induced insulin resistance in fat and muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2111777166,"Ubiquinone (coenzyme Q or Q) is an essential component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in eukaryotic cells. There are eight complementation groups of Q-deficientSaccharomyces cerevisiae mutants designatedcoq1-coq8. Here we report that COQ8 isABC1 (for Activity of bc1 complex), which was originally isolated as a multicopy suppressor of a cytochrome bmRNA translation defect (Bousquet, I., Dujardin, G., and Slonimski, P. P. (1991) EMBO J. 10, 2023–2031). Previous studies of abc1 mutants suggested that the mitochondrial respiratory complexes were thermosensitive and function inefficiently. Although initial characterization of the abc1 mutants revealed characteristics of Q-deficient mutants, levels of Q were reported to be similar to wild type. The suggested function of Abc1p was that it acts as a chaperone-like protein essential for the proper conformation and functioning of the bc1 and its neighboring complexes (Brasseur, G., Tron, P., Dujardin, G., Slonimski, P. P. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem. 246, 103–111). Studies presented here indicate that abc1/coq8 null mutants are defective in Q biosynthesis and accumulate 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid as the predominant intermediate. As observed in other yeast coq mutants, supplementation of growth media with Q6 rescues theabc1/coq8 null mutants for growth on nonfermentable carbon sources. Such supplementation also partially restores succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity in theabc1/coq8 null mutants. Abc1/Coq8p localizes to the mitochondria, and is proteolytically processed upon import. The findings presented here indicate that the previously reported thermosensitivity of the respiratory complexes of abc1/coq8mutants results from the lack of Q and a general deficiency in respiration, rather than a specific phenotype due to dysfunction of the Abc1 polypeptide. These results indicate that ABC1/COQ8 is essential for Q-biosynthesis and that the critical defect ofabc1/coq8 mutants is a lack of Q. Ubiquinone (coenzyme Q or Q) is an essential component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in eukaryotic cells. There are eight complementation groups of Q-deficientSaccharomyces cerevisiae mutants designatedcoq1-coq8. Here we report that COQ8 isABC1 (for Activity of bc1 complex), which was originally isolated as a multicopy suppressor of a cytochrome bmRNA translation defect (Bousquet, I., Dujardin, G., and Slonimski, P. P. (1991) EMBO J. 10, 2023–2031). Previous studies of abc1 mutants suggested that the mitochondrial respiratory complexes were thermosensitive and function inefficiently. Although initial characterization of the abc1 mutants revealed characteristics of Q-deficient mutants, levels of Q were reported to be similar to wild type. The suggested function of Abc1p was that it acts as a chaperone-like protein essential for the proper conformation and functioning of the bc1 and its neighboring complexes (Brasseur, G., Tron, P., Dujardin, G., Slonimski, P. P. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem. 246, 103–111). Studies presented here indicate that abc1/coq8 null mutants are defective in Q biosynthesis and accumulate 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid as the predominant intermediate. As observed in other yeast coq mutants, supplementation of growth media with Q6 rescues theabc1/coq8 null mutants for growth on nonfermentable carbon sources. Such supplementation also partially restores succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity in theabc1/coq8 null mutants. Abc1/Coq8p localizes to the mitochondria, and is proteolytically processed upon import. The findings presented here indicate that the previously reported thermosensitivity of the respiratory complexes of abc1/coq8mutants results from the lack of Q and a general deficiency in respiration, rather than a specific phenotype due to dysfunction of the Abc1 polypeptide. These results indicate that ABC1/COQ8 is essential for Q-biosynthesis and that the critical defect ofabc1/coq8 mutants is a lack of Q. ubiquinone or coenzyme Q coenzyme Q with a n-decane tail 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid coenzyme Q with either 2 or 6 isoprene groups in the tail kilobase(s) hemagglutinin high performance liquid chromatography Ubiquinone (coenzyme Q or Q)1 is a prenylated benzoquinone found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic membranes (1Olson R.E. Rudney H. Vitam. Horm. 1983; 40: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes Q is found in the plasma membrane and functions in respiratory electron transport as well as in disulfide bond formation of periplasmic membrane proteins (2Kobayashi T. Kishigami S.

Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes Q is a an integral and essential component in mitochondrial electron and proton transport in the respiratory complexes I, II, and III (4Dutton P.L. Ohnishi T. Darrouzet E. Leonard M.A. Sharp R.E. Gibney B.R. Daldal F. Moser C.C. Kagan V.E. Quinn P.J. Coenzyme Q: Molecular Mechanisms in Health and Disease. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2001: 65-82Google Scholar). In addition to its function in respiratory electron transport, Q forms a critical link between a wide variety of other Q-linked dehydrogenases, including those acting on fatty acids, glycerol 3-phosphate, dihydroorotate, choline, sarcosine, and dimethylglycine (5Lenaz G. De Santis A. Bertoli E. Lenaz G. Coenzyme Q. Wiley, Chichester, United Kingdom1985: 165-199Google Scholar). Recently, Q has been identified as an essential component of the H+ pumping function of UCP1, an uncoupling protein involved in thermogenesis (6Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Klingenberg M. Nature. 2000; 408: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). UCP1 depends on the availability of oxidized Q (QH2 is inactive), suggesting that the redox state of Q is important in regulating uncoupling activity. It is intriguing that another mechanism for regulating mitochondrial membrane potential, the permeability transition, is inhibited by Q and either inhibited or stimulated by various Q derivatives (7Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 8Walter L. Nogueira V. Leverve X. Heitz M.P. Bernardi P. Fontaine E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29521-29527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The permeability transition results in the opening of an unidentified, proteinaceous channel, releasing matrix contents with a molecular mass of up to 1500 Da. The opening of this channel reflects mitochondrial dysfunction, and is one of several pathways leading to programmed cell death (9Nijhawan D. Honarpour N. Wang X.D. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Q is found in membranes throughout eukaryotic cells (10Ernster L. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). In the plasma membrane, Q is involved in an enzyme-mediated trans-plasma membrane electron transport system that can reduce extracellular compounds such as the ascorbyl radical (11Santos-Ocana C.

Crane F.L. Navas P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). By virtue of its ability to redox cycle, Q also has the capacity to function as a lipid soluble antioxidant, either directly as a chain-terminating antioxidant or indirectly by reducing the α-tocopheroxyl radical (14Kagan V.E. Nohl H. Quinn P.J. Cadenas E. Packer L. Handbook of Antioxidants. Marcel Dekker, New York1996: 157-201Google Scholar). Studies of Q-biosynthesis in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have enabled the elucidation of a putative Q-biosynthetic pathway (1Olson R.E. Rudney H. Vitam.

Tzagoloff and Dieckmann (17Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) described eight complementation groups of Q-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants,coq1-coq8. The COQ1 gene product catalyzes the formation of the polyprenyldiphosphate precursor tail of Q (18Ashby M.N. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13157-13164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The COQ2 gene product catalyzes the attachment of the polyprenyldiphosphate tail to 4-hydroxybenzoate, leading to the formation of the early Q-biosynthetic intermediate 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (HHB) (19Ashby M.N. Kutsunai S.Y. Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4128-4236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From HHB, a series of ring modifications produce Q and require the COQ3,COQ4, COQ5, COQ6, COQ7, andCOQ8 genes (20Jonassen T. Clarke C.F. Kagan V.E. Quinn P.J. Coenzyme Q: From Molecular Mechanisms to Nutrition and Health. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2001: 185-208Google Scholar). Yeast coq3-coq8 mutants lack Q and accumulate HHB as the predominant intermediate (21Poon W.W. Do T.Q. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Mol. Aspects Med. 1997; 18: s121-s127Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Coq3p is located in the mitochondrial matrix, peripherally associated with the inner membrane and catalyzes both O-methylation steps in Q biosynthesis (22Poon W.W. Barkovich R.J. Hsu A.Y. Frankel A. Lee P.T. Shepherd J.N. Myles D.C. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21665-21672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Coq5p functions as aC-methyltransferase in the mitochondria (23Barkovich R.J. Shtanko A. Shepherd J.A. Lee P.T. Myles D.C. Tzagoloff A. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9182-9188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Dibrov E. Robinson K.M. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9175-9181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Coq6p is likely to function as a flavin-dependent monooxygenase, adding one or more of the ring oxygens (20Jonassen T. Clarke C.F. Kagan V.E. Quinn P.J. Coenzyme Q: From Molecular Mechanisms to Nutrition and Health. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2001: 185-208Google Scholar). Coq7p is tightly associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane, and is required for the last monooxygenase step in Q biosynthesis (25Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 26Jonassen T. Proft M. Randez-Gil F. Schultz J.R. Marbois B.N. Entian K.-D. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3351-3357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Coq4p is located in the mitochondrial matrix peripherally associated with the inner membrane (27Belogrudov, G. I., Lee, P. T., Jonassen, T., Gin, P., Hsu, A. Y., and Clarke, C. F. (2001) Arch. Biochem. Biophys., in press.Google Scholar). Although the precise functions of Coq4p and Coq7p in Q biosynthesis are not known, genetic evidence suggests that many of the Coq polypeptides may function in a multisubunit complex converting HHB to Q (27Belogrudov, G. I., Lee, P. T., Jonassen, T., Gin, P., Hsu, A. Y., and Clarke, C. F. (2001) Arch. Biochem. Biophys., in press.Google Scholar, 28Hsu A.Y. Do T.Q. Lee P.T. Clarke C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Previous characterization of a coq8-1 mutant (strain C130) showed it to be respiratory defective, Q-deficient (29Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and to accumulate HHB as the predominant intermediate (21Poon W.W. Do T.Q. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Mol. Aspects Med. 1997; 18: s121-s127Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This study reports the isolation of the COQ8 gene and its identification as the previously described ABC1 gene. ABC1 was originally isolated as a multicopy suppressor of a cytochromeb mRNA translation defect (30Bousquet I. Dujardin G. Slonimski P.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2023-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Studies ofabc1 mutants have suggested that Abc1p acts as a chaperone-like protein essential for function of thebc1 complex (31Brasseur G. Tron P. Dujardin G. Slonimski P.P. Brivet-Chevillotte P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The data presented here show that Abc1/Coq8p is required for Q biosynthesis. The implications of our findings on the functional role of ABC1/COQ8 and its gene product are discussed. The strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Growth media for yeast were prepared as described (34Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1997: 145-154Google Scholar) and included YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose), YPE (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% ethanol), YPGal (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% galactose), YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glycerol), SDC (0.18% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% dextrose, 0.14% NaH2PO4, 0.5% (NH4)2SO4, complete amino acid supplement), SD-Leu (SDC minus leucine), and SD-Ura (SDC minus uracil). The complete supplement was modified so that the final concentration of each component was as described (23Barkovich R.J. Shtanko A. Shepherd J.A. Lee P.T. Myles D.C. Tzagoloff A. Clarke C.F. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Media for sporulation and tetrad analysis were prepared according to Adams et al. (34Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1997: 145-154Google Scholar). All components of growth media were purchased from Difco, Fisher, or Sigma. 2% Agar was added for solid media.Table IGenotypes and sources of S. cerevisiae strainsStrainGenotypeSource or Ref.W303-1Aa,ade2–2, his3–11,15, leu2–3, 115, trp1–1, ura3–1R.

Open table in a new tab Yeast strains CH130-A1 (coq8-1) and FYΔABC1 (abc1Δ::TRP1) were grown in 1 liter of SDC media supplemented with 0.65 μCi of [U-14C]p-hydroxybenzoic acid (365 Ci/mol), synthesized from l-[U-14C]tyrosine by alkali heat fusion (36Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16636-16644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 3 days of incubation at 30 °C with shaking (200 rpm), cultures were harvested (A600 nm = 10), and lipids were extracted as described (25Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Approximately 10–12% of the 14C-radiolabel added to the cultures was recovered in the lipid extracts. Extracts were concentrated and aliquots containing 104 cpm were analyzed by normal phase HPLC employing a cyanopropyl column (Zorbax, 5 μm, 4.6 mm × 250 mm, MacMod Analytical, Chadds Ford, PA) as described by Poon et al. (37Poon W.W. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The column was equilibrated with a mobile phase composed of 98% solvent A (hexane) and 2% solvent B (isopropyl alcohol/hexane/water/methylene chloride, 52:41:5:2) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Ten minutes after sample injection, the percentage of solvent B was increased linearly from 2 to 27% in 25 min (35 min from the start) and then from 27 to 100% in 20 min (55 min after the start). In the next 5 min, percentage of solvent B was decreased linearly from 100 to 2% and remained at 2% for 30 min to equilibrate the column before next sample injection. The radioactivity of 1-ml fractions were measured by scintillation counting in 10 ml of BIOsafe nonaqueous scintillation mixture (Research Products International) with a Beckman scintillation counter (model LS-3133P). CH130-E1 (coq8-1) yeast were grown to early-log phase in YPD medium and transformed as described (38Marbois B.N. Hsu A. Pillai R. Colicelli J. Clarke C.F. Gene ( Amst .). 1994; 138: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with a YEp24-based plasmid library of S. cerevisiae genomic DNA (39Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) containing the URA3 gene as a selectable marker. A total of 44,000 transformants were obtained by selection on SD-Ura plates and, after a 3-day incubation at 30 °C, were replica plated onto YPG plates to test for respiratory growth. Thirty-eight colonies were complemented for respiratory deficiency as indicated by growth on YPG plate media. Eleven of the putative Q-prototrophic transformants were further purified and tested for cosegregation of uracil prototrophy and respiration competency following vegetative growth in rich media. All 11 showed co-segregation of the Ura− and YPG− phenotypes, indicating these traits were plasmid linked. Yeast plasmid DNA was recovered from each transformant and each of the 11 clones contained overlapping segments of genomic DNA inserts as confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and Southern analysis (data not shown). One clone, pTM, was chosen for further study. A 4.0-kb HpaI/NheI fragment of pTM containing the ABC1 gene was isolated from pTM, processed for blunt end ligation and inserted into aSmaI-digested CEN-based vector pRS316 (40Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) generating p3HN4. Transformation of CH130-E1 with p3HN4 complemented the glycerol growth deficiency. Two separate deletion alleles of ABC1 were prepared. In both cases, a 1.1-kbAflII/SunI fragment of p3HN4 was replaced (after preparation for blunt end ligation) with either a 1.1-kbHIS3 or 0.8-kb TRP1 fragment, derived from YDp-H or YDp-W, respectively (41Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids, pHQ8Δ and pWQ5Δ, were each used to obtain a linearBamHI/ClaI fragment with the disrupted gene. W303-1A was transformed with 1 μg of a linear fragment from pHQ8Δ by the procedure of Elble (42Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the histidine prototrophic clones from the transformations were respiration-defective and were complemented by the ρo strain, JM8, but not by the coq8-1 strain CH130-E1. Nuclear DNAs from 8 independent transformants were digested with BamHI and ClaI and separated on 1% agarose. The probe, a 4-kbHpaI/NheI fragment from pTM, hybridized to three fragments of 1.6-, 1.4-, and 1.2-kb in the genomic DNA of wild-type strain W303-1A. The genomic DNA of the mutant strain (W303ΔABC1) contained two fragments of 1.4 and 2.8 kb as expected for the disrupted allele. Alternatively, linearized pWQ5Δ was used to transform FY251. Most of the tryptophan prototrophic clones issued from the transformations were respiration-defective and were complemented by the ρo strain JM8, but not by the coq8-1 strain CH130-E1. Nuclear DNA from one transformant was digested withBamHI and ClaI and separated on 1% agarose. The probe, a 4-kb HpaI/NheI fragment from pTM, hybridized to three fragments of 1.6, 1.4, and 1.2 kb in the genomic DNA of FY251. The genomic DNA of the mutant strain (FYΔABC1) contained two fragments of 1.4- and 2.5-kb, as expected for the disrupted allele. Yeast cells were grown overnight in 5 ml of YPD to saturation. Overnight cultures were then diluted into 30 ml of YPE, in 125-ml Erlenmeyer flasks, to a density of ∼0.25 A600 nm, with or without 15 μm Q6 supplementation. Q6 supplementation increased the absorbance of the culture by ∼0.01 A600 nm. These cultures were subsequently incubated at 30 °C with shaking (200 rpm). Growth was monitored by A600 nm measurements over a period of 8 days. Samples were taken after 8 days of growth and plated on YPD plates to confirm that cultures were not contaminated. Yeast cells were grown overnight in 5 ml of YPGal containing 0.1% dextrose. Overnight cultures were diluted into 100 ml of YPGal (0.1% dextrose) to a density of ∼0.004 A600 nm. Cell cultures were grown and harvested at ∼4A600 nm. Yeast crude mitochondrial fractions were prepared as described (35Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and aliquots were stored frozen at −80 °C. Succinate-cytochrome c reductase activities were assayed at 30 °C in 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm sodium succinate, 500 μm EDTA, 250 μm potassium cyanide, and 50 μm horse heart cytochrome c (43Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 12.5 μg of mitochondrial protein was incubated in buffer without cytochrome c for 15 min. The reaction was initiated by addition of cytochrome c and monitored at 550 − 540 nm for 3 min. Specific cytochrome c reductase activities were determined from the initial linear rate of reaction at 550 − 540 nm using an extinction coefficient of 18.5 mm−1 cm−1 (43Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were performed in triplicate. For assays in the presence of added Q6, mitochondria were incubated 15 min in buffer containing 10 μm Q6, 1% EtOH, prior to initiation by addition of cytochrome c. This concentration of Q6 was sufficient to saturate the succinate-cytochromec reductase activity. Crude mitochondria from various yeast strains of the CEN.PK2–1C background were prepared and stored as described above. Cytochrome c oxidase activities were assayed at 30 °C in 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 25 μm reduced cytochrome c(43Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol.

Horse heart cytochrome c was reduced in 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, withl-ascorbate, and the ascorbate was subsequently removed by dialysis. The reaction was initiated by adding 25 μg of mitochondrial protein and the reaction rate was monitored by following the oxidation of cytochrome c at 550 − 540 nm for 30 s (44Malaney S. Trumpower B.L. Deber C.M. Robinson B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17495-17501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c oxidase activities were determined from the initial linear rate of reaction using an extinction coefficient of 18.5 mm−1 cm−1 (43Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the thermosensitivity of cytochrome c oxidase activities, mitochondria were incubated at 37 °C and over time aliquots were assayed. All assays were performed in triplicate. An in vitrotranscription template plasmid was constructed by inserting theABC1/COQ8 open reading frame into the pBluescript SK(+) vector downstream of the T7 promoter. The ABC1/COQ8 open reading frame was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from pTM with 5′ primer pHAC8-1 (5′-ACGCACGCGTCGACTTATGGTTACAAATATGGTGAA-3′) and 3′ primer p2H8R (5′-CGGAATTCTTAAACTTTATAGGCAAAAATC-3′) with Vent DNA polymerase. The polymerase chain reaction product was gel-purified and kinase-treated and inserted into the EcoRV site of pBluscript SK(+) vector. The resulting clone, pBCOQ8, was linearized by XbaI and served as template for in vitro transcription (Promega Ribomax Large Scale RNA Production System). The resulting mRNA was then translated using Promega Flexi Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate System in the presence of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, at final concentration of 0.75 μm). Both the mRNA and the synthesized polypeptides were stored at −80 °C. The isolation of mitochondria (from D273-10B) and import reaction conditions were performed based on Yaffe (45Yaffe M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and described in Hsu et al. (46Hsu A.Y. Poon W.W. Shepherd J.A. Myles D.C. Clarke C.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9797-9806Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Each import reaction contained 14 μl of radiolabeled in vitrotranslated product and mitochondria containing 200 μg of protein. Valinomycin was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml where appropriate. Following 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, the mitochondria were reisolated and washed once. Triton X-100 and proteinase K treatment after the import was performed by adding 1% Triton X-100 and/or 50 μg/ml proteinase K, final concentration, to resuspended mitochondria. The proteolytic digest was allowed to proceed at 0 °C for 20 min and was terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 1 mm. The samples were mixed with sample buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min prior to analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (12% polyacrylamide) and autoradiography. Two yeast expression plasmids, one single copy and one multiple copy, were constructed to express the Abc1/Coq8 polypeptide containing a carboxyl-terminal peptide (MYPYDVPDYASLDGPMST) corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) viral protein, an epitope for the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (47Niman H.L.

Construction began by directional cloning using SalI and NotI sites in the plasmid pADCL (48Spain B.H. Koo D. Ramakrishnan M. Dzudzor B. Colicelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25435-25444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The ABC1/COQ8 open reading frame region without the stop codon was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using 5′ primer pHAC8-1 (described above) and 3′ primer pHAC8-2 (5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCAGAACTTTATAGGCAAAAATCT-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was directionally cloned into the multiple copy pADCL vector (SalI and NotI at 5′ and 3′, respectively), to generate pHA8-1, a multiple copy vector containing the ABC1-HA construct. pRSHA8-1, a single copy version of the ABC1-HA construct, was generated by removing the 3.6-kb transcriptional cassette from pHA8-1 by BamHI partial digestion and insertion into the BamHI site of the vector pRS316 (40Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast abc1/coq8 mutants were transformed with pHA8-1, pRSHA8-1, or pTM (42Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected for the presence of either the LEU2 gene (pHA8-1) or theURA3 gene (pRSHA8-1) on SD-Leu or SD-Ura plate media. Colonies obtained on the respective selective plate media were subsequently replica plated to YPG plate media. The Abc1-HA epitope fusion protein r"

Treatment with the selective Src family kinase inhibitor pyrazolopyrimidine 2 (PP-2) markedly reduced the phosphorylation of both Tyr-397 and Tyr-577 induced by fibronectin. Furthermore, fibronectin-mediated FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397 was dramatically reduced in SYF cells (deficient in Src, Yes, and Fyn expression). Stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with bombesin also induced a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of endogenous FAK at Tyr-397. In contrast to the results obtained with fibronectin, PP-2 did not prevent FAK Tyr-397 phosphorylation stimulated by bombesin at a concentration (10 micrometer) that suppressed bombesin-induced FAK Tyr-577 phosphorylation. Similarly, PP-2 did not prevent Tyr-397 phosphorylation in Swiss 3T3 cells stimulated with other G protein-coupled receptor agonists including vasopressin, bradykinin, endothelin, and lysophosphatidic acid. Lysophosphatidic acid also induced FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397 in SYF cells. Our results identify, for first time, the existence of Src-dependent and Src-independent pathways leading to FAK autophosphorylation at Tyr-397 stimulated by adhesion-dependent signals and G protein-coupled receptor agonists in the same cell."

Protein synthesis inhibition is required to sensitize the endothelium to lipopolysaccharide-induced apoptosis, suggesting that a constitutive or inducible cytoprotective protein(s) is required for endothelial survival. We have identified two known endothelial anti-apoptotic proteins, c-FLIP and Mcl-1, the expression of which is decreased markedly in the presence of cycloheximide.

Cell Immunol. 1989; 119: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This latter finding suggests that either a constitutively expressed protein with a relatively short half-life or an inducible protein is requisite for EC survival following LPS exposure. Similarly, two LPS-inducible cytokines, IL-1β and TNF-α, induce human EC apoptosis only when new gene expression is blocked (18Pohlman T.H. Harlan J.M.

Together, these in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that the vascular endothelium is a key target of LPS-induced apoptosis.The mechanisms by which LPS activates apoptosis remain unknown. Efforts to elucidate LPS signaling pathways, apoptotic or otherwise, have been hampered by the lack of an identifiable membrane-bound receptor capable of signal transduction. Recently, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 has been identified in both cells of monocytic lineage and EC as the receptor responsible for LPS activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway (25Faure E. Equils O. Sieling P.A. Thomas L. Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J. Polentarutti N. Muzio M. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11058-11063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 26Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Takeda K. Akira S. J.

J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MyD88, a TLR-4-binding protein that has a requisite role in the downstream activation of NF-κB in EC, contains a death domain (DD) (28Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 29Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J. Mancinelli R. Xu X.P. Jin Y. Faure E. Mantovani A. Rothe M. Muzio M. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7611-7614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). DD are conserved regions of amino acids, which facilitate protein-protein interaction. In the well characterized TNF pathway, the TNF receptor-binding protein, TRADD, recruits another adapter protein, FADD, through the interaction of their respective death domains. An additional conserved sequence in FADD, the death effector domain (DED), enables the recruitment of caspase 8, an upstream cysteine protease whose activation initiates a cascade of proteolytic events characteristic of apoptosis. We have previously reported that LPS-induced EC apoptosis is FADD-dependent (11Choi K.B. Wong F. Harlan J.M. Chaudhary P.M. Hood L. Karsan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20185-20188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Whether FADD is recruited to MyD88 following LPS stimulation via binding of their respective DD remains unknown.The anti-apoptotic pathways utilized by human EC to resist LPS-induced apoptosis have yet to be elucidated. Human EC sensitivity to LPS-induced apoptosis is dependent on new protein or mRNA synthesis inhibition, suggesting that either an inducible or constitutively expressed protein is responsible for protection (30Hu X. Yee E. Harlan J.M. Wong F. Karsan A. Blood. 1998; 92: 2759-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS has previously been shown to up-regulate two cytoprotective proteins, the Bcl-2 homologue, A1, and the zinc-finger protein, A20, in EC (30Hu X. Yee E. Harlan J.M. Wong F. Karsan A. Blood. 1998; 92: 2759-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of A1, A20, or Bcl-xL confers partial protection against LPS and cycloheximide (CHX)-induced apoptosis. There is doubt, however, concerning the physiological relevance of these overexpression studies. Similar to LPS, sensitization of human EC to TNF-α-induced apoptosis requires inhibition of gene expression. Further, overexpression of A1 or Bcl-xL protects EC against TNF-α and CHX induced-apoptosis (31Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The selective inhibition of A1 or Bcl-xL gene expression, however, fails to sensitize human EC to direct TNF-α-induced apoptosis, indicating that these proteins are not critical for protection (32Ackermann E.J. Taylor J.K. Narayana R. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11245-11252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Another proposed mechanism of protection is through NF-κB-dependent gene expression of certain cytoprotective proteins, including cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAP) (33Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). Selective blockade of the NF-κB signaling pathway by expression of a mutant IκB sensitizes EC to apoptosis induced by prolonged exposure to TNF-α, but not LPS (14Zen K. Karsan A. Stempien-Otero A. Yee E. Tupper J. Li X. Eunson T. Kay M.A. Wilson C.B. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28808-28815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that cell survival following LPS exposure is NF-κB-independent. In the present report, we have attempted to elucidate the mechanism of human EC resistance to LPS-induced apoptosis.

Sensitization of human EC to LPS-induced apoptosis requires the inhibition of either mRNA or protein synthesis (18Pohlman T.H. Harlan J.M. Cell Immunol. 1989; 119: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This latter finding suggests that either a constitutively expressed protein with a relatively short half-life or an inducible protein is requisite for EC survival following LPS exposure. Similarly, two LPS-inducible cytokines, IL-1β and TNF-α, induce human EC apoptosis only when new gene expression is blocked (18Pohlman T.H. Harlan J.M. Cell Immunol. 1989; 119: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Apoptosis has been implicated as an important mechanism of in vivo cell death following LPS exposure. Tissues and organs obtained from either patients who have died of sepsis and multi-organ failure (19Hotchkiss R.S. Swanson P.E. Freeman B.D. Tinsley K.W. Cobb J.P. Matuschak G.M. Buchman T.G.

In a murine model of sepsis, apoptotic EC have been detected in pulmonary capillaries (20Hotchkiss R.S. Swanson P.E. Cobb J.P. Jacobson A. Buchman T.G. Karl I.E. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 25: 1298-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Intravenous administration of endotoxin into rabbits or rats induces EC death and detachment from the artery wall (22Gaynor E. Bouvier C. Spaet T.H.

In mice challenged with either LPS or TNF-α, disseminated EC apoptosis has been reported in the lung, thymus, and intestine (15Fujita M. Kuwano K. Kunitake R. Hagimoto N. Miyazaki H. Kaneko Y.

Finally, injection of a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor following LPS administration decreased EC apoptosis in the lung and improved survival in a murine model of acute lung injury (24Kawasaki M.

Together, these in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that the vascular endothelium is a key target of LPS-induced apoptosis. The mechanisms by which LPS activates apoptosis remain unknown. Efforts to elucidate LPS signaling pathways, apoptotic or otherwise, have been hampered by the lack of an identifiable membrane-bound receptor capable of signal transduction. Recently, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 has been identified in both cells of monocytic lineage and EC as the receptor responsible for LPS activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway (25Faure E. Equils O. Sieling P.A. Thomas L. Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J. Polentarutti N. Muzio M. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11058-11063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 26Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Takeda K. Akira S. J.

J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MyD88, a TLR-4-binding protein that has a requisite role in the downstream activation of NF-κB in EC, contains a death domain (DD) (28Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 29Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J. Mancinelli R. Xu X.P. Jin Y. Faure E. Mantovani A. Rothe M. Muzio M. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7611-7614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). DD are conserved regions of amino acids, which facilitate protein-protein interaction. In the well characterized TNF pathway, the TNF receptor-binding protein, TRADD, recruits another adapter protein, FADD, through the interaction of their respective death domains. An additional conserved sequence in FADD, the death effector domain (DED), enables the recruitment of caspase 8, an upstream cysteine protease whose activation initiates a cascade of proteolytic events characteristic of apoptosis. We have previously reported that LPS-induced EC apoptosis is FADD-dependent (11Choi K.B. Wong F. Harlan J.M. Chaudhary P.M. Hood L. Karsan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20185-20188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Whether FADD is recruited to MyD88 following LPS stimulation via binding of their respective DD remains unknown. The anti-apoptotic pathways utilized by human EC to resist LPS-induced apoptosis have yet to be elucidated. Human EC sensitivity to LPS-induced apoptosis is dependent on new protein or mRNA synthesis inhibition, suggesting that either an inducible or constitutively expressed protein is responsible for protection (30Hu X. Yee E. Harlan J.M. Wong F. Karsan A. Blood. 1998; 92: 2759-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS has previously been shown to up-regulate two cytoprotective proteins, the Bcl-2 homologue, A1, and the zinc-finger protein, A20, in EC (30Hu X. Yee E. Harlan J.M. Wong F. Karsan A. Blood. 1998; 92: 2759-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of A1, A20, or Bcl-xL confers partial protection against LPS and cycloheximide (CHX)-induced apoptosis. There is doubt, however, concerning the physiological relevance of these overexpression studies. Similar to LPS, sensitization of human EC to TNF-α-induced apoptosis requires inhibition of gene expression. Further, overexpression of A1 or Bcl-xL protects EC against TNF-α and CHX induced-apoptosis (31Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The selective inhibition of A1 or Bcl-xL gene expression, however, fails to sensitize human EC to direct TNF-α-induced apoptosis, indicating that these proteins are not critical for protection (32Ackermann E.J. Taylor J.K. Narayana R. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11245-11252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Another proposed mechanism of protection is through NF-κB-dependent gene expression of certain cytoprotective proteins, including cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAP) (33Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). Selective blockade of the NF-κB signaling pathway by expression of a mutant IκB sensitizes EC to apoptosis induced by prolonged exposure to TNF-α, but not LPS (14Zen K. Karsan A. Stempien-Otero A. Yee E. Tupper J. Li X. Eunson T. Kay M.A. Wilson C.B. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28808-28815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that cell survival following LPS exposure is NF-κB-independent. In the present report, we have attempted to elucidate the mechanism of human EC resistance to LPS-induced apoptosis."

The versatility of this phospholipid is provided by combinations of phosphorylation on the 3′, 4′, and 5′ positions of the inositol head group. Two distinct structural families of phosphoinositide (PI) kinases have so far been identified and named after their prototypic members, the PI 3-kinase and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) phosphate kinase families, both of which have been found to contain structural homologues possessing PI 4-kinase activity. Nevertheless, the prevalent PtdIns 4-kinase activity in many mammalian cell types is conferred by the widespread type II PtdIns 4-kinase, which has so far resisted molecular characterization. We have partially purified the human type II isoform from plasma membrane rafts of human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells and obtained peptide mass and sequence data. The results allowed the cDNA containing the full open reading frame to be cloned. The predicted amino acid sequence revealed that the type II enzyme is the prototypic member of a novel, third family of PI kinases. We have named the purified protein type IIα and a second human isoform, type IIβ.

Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 167-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several distinct metabolic pathways of PtdIns1 phosphorylation exist in eukaryotic cells, producing important effectors such as PtdIns 4,5-bisphosphate, PtdIns 3,4-bisphosphate, and PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate (3Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). The first step in the phosphorylation of PtdIns in many receptor-dependent phospholipase C (PLC) and PI 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways involves the synthesis of PtdIns 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) by PtdIns 4-kinase (PtdIns4K) activity (4Pike L.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 692-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The PI kinase sequences that have been determined so far fall into two families, the PI3K family (5Keith C.T. Schreiber S.L.

Waterfield M.D. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which includes all the hitherto known PI3K and PtdIns4K sequences (3Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar), and the PtdIns phosphate kinase (PtdInsPK) family (3Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev.

Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 115-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All PI3Ks and PtdIns4Ks cloned so far display significant homology within their kinase domains. In contrast, members of the PtdInsPK family have quite distinct sequences. However, recent structural studies have shown that whereas the PtdInsPKs display little primary sequence homology with the PI3K family, they share a common protein fold that is also conserved in many protein kinases (8Rao V.D.

Williams R.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Early chromatographic purification of phosphoinositide kinase activities from bovine brain (4Pike L.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 692-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and cultured rodent fibroblasts (10Whitman M. Kaplan D. Roberts T. Cantley L. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) identified three fractions containing PtdIns kinase activity, termed types I to III. The type II and III fractions contain different PtdIns4K activities, and the type I fraction was subsequently shown to contain PI3K activity (11Whitman M. Downes C.P. Keeler M. Keller T. Cantley L. Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). It is now known that the type I PI3K and type III PtdIns4K enzymes have related sequences and belong to the PI3K family (3Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). However, the fraction containing the type II PtdIns4K (PtdIns4K II) has so far not been characterized at the molecular level despite the fact that in many mammalian cells, the predominant pathway of PtdIns phosphorylation is initiated by this strongly membrane-associated PtdIns4K (3Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Perhaps surprisingly, although members of the PI3K and PtdInsPK families have been readily purified and cloned, numerous attempts to purify the PtdIns4K II enzyme (see Ref. 12Wetzker R. Klinger R. Hsuan J. Fry M.J. Kauffmann Z.A. Muller E. Frunder H. Waterfield M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar and references therein) have failed to lead to the cDNA being identified. These preparations were probably often impure as PtdIns4K II is labile, difficult to solubilize, and tends to aggregate strongly with other proteins. Indeed, a published cDNA sequence was subsequently found to encode a long-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase (13Yamakawa A. Nishizawa M. Fujiwara K.T. Kawai S. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17580-17583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the massive increase in genome data, approaches based on homology to known PtdIns4Ks, such as degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers or data base trawling, have also failed to identify the PtdIns4K II sequence.

Although there is indirect evidence for the regulation of the PtdIns4K II activity by serine and tyrosine residue phosphorylation (19Kauffmann Z.A. Klinger R. Endemann G. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R.

Cockcroft S. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the inability to purify or immunoprecipitate the enzyme has precluded definitive experiments to evaluate its function and regulation. PtdIns4K II has been identified in the plasma membrane, lysosomal, microsomal, transport vesicle, and nuclear compartments (4Pike L.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 692-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). More recently this isozyme has been shown to exist in subdomains of the plasma membrane termed non-caveolar membrane rafts (24Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Tan S.K. Hsuan J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17115-17121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), in which receptor-dependent PLC signaling also appears to be localized (25Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Rafts are typically small, cholesterol-rich membrane domains of low buoyant density, which are generally insoluble in 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C (reviewed in Ref. 26Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar). To address questions regarding the pivotal role of this enzyme in many signaling pathways, we set out to purify sufficient human PtdIns4K II to allow the cDNA to be identified. Plasma membrane rafts containing PtdIns4K II were isolated from human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells, employing similar methods to those described previously (24Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Tan S.K. Hsuan J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17115-17121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Two chromatographic purification steps were selected from the work of Deuel and co-workers (27Porter F.D. Li Y.S. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8989-8995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), adapted to microscale purification and modified using detergents appropriate for cholesterol-rich rafts. A431 cells were cultured to confluence in six 24 × 24-cm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Monolayers were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into 12 ml of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 0.25 msucrose, and protease inhibitors (Complete™ Mini, EDTA-free; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) prior to Dounce homogenization. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 5 min. Membranes were pelleted from the post-nuclear supernatant by centrifugation at 190,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Low density membrane rafts were prepared using a modification of the method of Song et al. (28Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 190,000 ×g membrane pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 11.0, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmβ-octylglucoside, and 4 mm deoxycholate, containing Complete™ protease inhibitors. The membrane suspension was sonicated on ice (10 × 5-s bursts at 40% maximum power using a VC130PB sonicator (Sonics and Materials Inc.), and an equal volume of 80% sucrose in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm EDTA was added. This solution was transferred to a 12.5-ml ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with 4 ml of 35% sucrose and 4 ml of 5% sucrose both in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmNa2CO3, 10 mm EGTA and 10 mm EDTA. The discontinuous sucrose gradient was centrifuged at 4 °C for 16 h at 190,000 × g. Rafts were then collected at the 5 and 35% sucrose interface, washed with ∼12 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl and repelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C for 1 h at 190,000 ×g. Purified rafts were suspended in 3 ml of base buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT) containing Complete™ protease inhibitors and sonicated (10 × 5-s bursts at 40% maximum power) using a VC130PB sonicator. The dispersed rafts were solubilized by the addition of β-octylglucoside and deoxycholate to 100 and 40 mm, respectively, diluted 8-fold with base buffer, and then applied to a MonoQ column (PC 1.6/5; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer QA (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% reduced Triton X-100) on a SMART chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed in buffer QA and developed with a discontinuous salt gradient in buffer QA (20–189 mmNaCl at 0–19 min, 189–360 mm NaCl at 19–21 min, and 360–900 mm NaCl at 21–24 min). PtdIns4K activity was collected at ∼19–19.2 min, diluted 15-fold with buffer SA (20 mm bis-Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% reduced Triton X-100), and applied to a MiniS column (PC 3.2/3; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer SA. After washing in buffer SA, the column was developed with a continuous salt gradient in buffer SA (50–900 mm NaCl in 5 min). The peak of PtdIns4K activity was collected at ∼2 min. In-gel assays and product analysis using TLC were performed as described previously (12Wetzker R. Klinger R. Hsuan J. Fry M.J. Kauffmann Z.A. Muller E. Frunder H. Waterfield M. Eur. J.

Solution assays containing 5 μl of MonoS column fractions or 10 ng of GST-PtdIns4K IIα were performed in 100-μl volumes containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm PtdIns, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 200 μm [γ−32P]ATP (1 μCi/assay). Assays were started by the addition of ATP and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C before being terminated by the addition of HCl to 0.5m. Under these conditions the addition of radioactive phosphate to PtdIns was linear (data not shown). The organic phase was extracted (12Wetzker R. Klinger R. Hsuan J. Fry M.J. Kauffmann Z.A. Muller E. Frunder H. Waterfield M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the lipid products were analyzed by TLC separation on Silica 60 plates (Whatman Inc.) in propan-1-ol/1m acetic acid (65:35) containing 1% 5 mphosphoric acid followed by autoradiography. Spots containing PtdIns4P were quantitated by scraping and counting in a Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and superficially stained with silver (29Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). The stained material comigrating with renatured activity was excised and subjected to reduction and alkylation using DTT and iodoacetic acid followed by in-gel digestion using modified trypsin (Promega, Southampton, UK). Matrix-assisted laser desorption (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) was performed on a Reflex III (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) reflector time of flight mass spectrometer in the reflector mode with delayed extraction and using a 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix. Spectra were internally calibrated using tryptic autolysis product ions of monoisotopic m/z 842.5100 and 2211.1046. The MS-Fit program (ProteinProspector; University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA) was employed for peptide mass mapping. For electrospray ionization (ESI) liquid chromatography MS/MS, samples were loaded on an Ultimate nano-HPLC (LCPackings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) via a Famos autosampler (LCPackings). All solvents were HPLC grade (Rathburn, Walkerburn, Scotland, UK). Separation was performed on a 75 μm × 150-mm silica C18 (5-μm particle size) PepMap™ column (LCPackings) with 0.1% formic acid in water as solvent A and 0.08% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile/20% water as solvent B. After equilibration with 5% solvent B, a linear gradient was developed to 40% solvent B in 32 min using a flow rate of 200 nl/min. The nano-HPLC was directly coupled to a Q-TOF ESI mass spectrometer (MicroMass, Manchester, UK) set up for automated liquid chromatography-MS/MS data acquisition using alternating collision energies. An antisense oligonucleotide primer (5′-TGCCTCTGGAGCTACCACCATG) designed to anneal 12 bases 3′ to the predicted stop codon of the putative PtdIns4K IIα open reading frame (ORF) was used to prime first strand cDNA synthesis from 0.5 μg of total RNA isolated from A431 cells (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was performed in 20 μl using the SuperScript™ Pre-amplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.). A 2-μl aliquot of this reaction was subsequently used to amplify an ∼1.4-kilobase band by PCR using the sense primer 5′-AATTCCATGGACGAGACGAGCCCACTAG (which incorporates an NcoI restriction site overlapping the predicted initiating methionine codon) and the antisense primer 5′-TGCCTCTGGAGCTACCACCATG encompassing the predicted termination codon. PCR was performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega). Cycling conditions were 96 °C for 30 s, 66 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min for 40 cycles. A single PCR product conforming to the predicted size of the putative PtdIns4K IIα ORF was gel purified and 3′A-tailed with dATP andTaq DNA polymerase (Promega) before cloning into the pGEM T-easy vector (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. The identity of the PCR product was confirmed by sequencing. A restriction fragment containing the ORF was excised from pGEM T-easy, cloned into the NcoI and SacI sites of pGEX-KG (31Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar), and expressed in the Escherichia coli XL1 strain (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) as a GST fusion protein. Expression of recombinant protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.1 mm, and cells were harvested after 3 h of growth at 30 °C. Bacterial pellets were sonicated in RIPA buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and Complete™ protease inhibitors. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, after which the recombinant protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described by the manufacturer. A cDNA probe representing the carboxyl-terminal 300 amino acids of PtdIns4K IIα was generated by PCR using the sense primer 5′-TTTGGCCGTGGACTGCCTTGCC and the antisense primer 5′-TGCCTCTGGAGCTACCACCATG. The ∼900-base pair (bp) PCR product was gel-purified and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming as described previously (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). This was then used to probe a human multiple-tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH). The probe was hybridized under high stringency conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions and then further washed in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated 0.1 × SSPE (3 m NaCl, 0.2m NaH2PO4, 0.2 m EDTA), 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 73 °C. Following autoradiography, the blot was stripped and reprobed with a human β-actin control probe (CLONTECH) as directed by the manufacturer. The vast majority of the PtdIns4K II in A431 cells is localized within buoyant, non-caveolar membrane rafts (24Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Tan S.K. Hsuan J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17115-17121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Consequently, purified rafts containing PtdIns4K II were solubilized in detergents and further fractionated using sequential anion and cation exchange chromatography. A single peak of activity was obtained at each stage (data not shown). Individual fractions from the MiniS column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using silver staining (Fig. 1 A) and PtdIns4K assays (Fig. 1 B). In-gel assays of fraction 3 showed that a band of 52-kDa apparent molecular mass coeluted and comigrated with the bulk of the activity (Fig. 1 C). A much smaller amount of activity was recovered at lower apparent molecular mass as reported previously (12Wetzker R. Klinger R. Hsuan J. Fry M.J. Kauffmann Z.A. Muller E. Frunder H. Waterfield M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). No other protein appeared to elute with the same profile as the 52-kDa protein or the kinase activity, suggesting the absence of a stoichiometrically associated subunit. Peptide mass mapping (32Pappin D.J.C. Horjup P. Bleasby A.J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 327-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar) of the 52-kDa protein produced 18 peptide masses. When the mass data were used to search the NCBI non-redundant data base using the MS-fit program they were found to match most closely a partial cDNA encoding a 30.2-kDa fragment of a human protein (EMBL accession number AL353952). This partial ORF lacked the initiating methionine. Searches of the NCBI human expressed sequence tag data base were performed using the 5′ region of this cDNA clone to complete the ORF. This revealed an overlapping clone (GenBankTM accession number AW246119), and further searches using AW246119 revealed two more overlapping clones (GenBankTM accession number BE302827 and EMBL accession number AL041898). A clear 1437-bp ORF downstream of an in-frame stop codon and a Kozak consensus sequence (33Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar) was identified from these clones. Furthermore, 14 additional overlapping sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers AA256505, AA495772, AA773590,BE170428, AW770113, AI674489, AI971186, BE300517, AA234669, AI492121,AA495828, and AI332390 and DDBJ accession numbers AK024317 andAK023236) were identified when the NCBI data bases were searched using the sequence assembled from the four clones (AL353952, AW246119,BE302827, and AL041898). The 1437-bp ORF could account for all 18 tryptic peptide ion masses; these 18 peptides accounted for 37% of the total amino acid sequence (sequence coverage). To confirm this assignment, the 52-kDa protein band was prepared as before, but the gel piece was washed with 80% acetone at −20 °C, and the peptide digest was desalted with a ZipTip™ (Millipore) to improve the quality of the MS analysis. Analysis of this sample by MALDI-MS (Fig.2) gave 24 peptides matching the predicted ORF (Fig. 3 A) with 44% sequence coverage and a mass accuracy of 100 ppm.Figure 3Amino acid sequences of human and yeast type II PtdIns4K homologues.

B, kinase domain alignment for the human PtdIns4K IIα, human PtdIns4K IIβ, and the S. cerevisiae type II homologue showing conserved residues. The alignment begins ∼30 residues amino-terminal of each putative P-loop and ends at each predicted carboxyl terminus. In this alignment PtdIns4K IIβ and S. cerevisiae kinase domains show 68 and 30% residue identity, respectively, with the PtdIns4K IIα kinase domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As a separate confirmation of these results, we employed ESI liquid chromatography-MS/MS to analyze the tryptic digest of the first preparation of the 52-kDa protein. This produced sequence information for four peptides, all of which confirmed the sequence assignment. Theinset in Fig. 2 shows the MS/MS spectrum of the tryptic peptide Ser460–Arg472, in which virtually the entire series of y-type fragment ions is evident. The 1437-bp ORF sequence obtained by data base searching was used to design complimentary oligonucleotide primers. These primers were used to isolate the cDNA by PCR with a proof-reading polymerase. Extensive DNA sequencing of independently cloned PCR products further verified the accuracy of the ORF. The 1437-bp ORF sequence encoded a polypeptide containing 479 amino acid residues and a molecular mass of ∼54.0 kDa. One motif was found using MacVector, version 7.0 (Oxford Molecular), a leucine zipper between residues 184 and 205 (Fig.3 A), which may mediate homo- or heterotypic protein-protein interactions. Although the mammalian enzyme is strongly bound to membranes, no transmembrane sequence or any established consensus for acylation was detected. The extended region amino-terminal to the kinase domain showed no homology with any other known protein. Although the enzyme is sensitive to inhibition by low micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ (12Wetzker R. Klinger R. Hsuan J. Fry M.J. Kauffmann Z.A. Muller E. Frunder H. Waterfield M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), no Ca2+ binding motif was apparent. Searches of NCBI data bases for homologous sequences revealed a set of additional sequences from different species including a second human sequence (NCBI accession number 8922869; see Fig. 3 B) and a single homologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCBI accession number 6322361; see Fig. 3 B) located on chromosome X. Alignment of over 10 different PtdIns4K II homologues 2M. dos Santos and J. J. Hsuan, submitted. revealed several candidate kinase motifs (34Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), including a candidate subdomain I P-loop sequence GSSGSY139, subdomain II ATP-binding K153, subdomain VIb catalytic residues DYIIRN307 or DRGNDN314, and subdomain VII Mg2+ binding motif DNG349. No obvious homology was apparent between the region amino-terminal to each putative kinase domain and the corresponding region of the PtdIns4K IIα enzyme. The lack of any close sequence similarity with either the PI3K or PtdInsPK family demonstrated that PtdIns4K IIα and its sequence homologues define a novel, third PI kinase family. The PtdIns4K IIα mRNA has an apparent size of 6.6 kilobases and appears to be ubiquitously expressed in human tissues (Fig. 4), which is consistent with the purification of this enzyme from numerous different primary tissues (see Ref. 12Wetzker R. Klinger R. Hsuan J. Fry M.J. Kauffmann Z.A. Muller E. Frunder H. Waterfield M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar and references therein). Expression appeared highest in kidney, brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and placenta and lowest in colon, thymus, and small intestine. The GST fusion protein expressed in bacteria had an apparent molecular mass of ∼80 kDa, and removal of the GST polypeptide using thrombin reduced the mass to ∼54 kDa (Fig.5 A). The fusion protein possessed PtdIns4K activity, which was undetectable in control preparations containing GST only, and the lipid product comigrated with a PtdIns4P standard (Fig. 5 B). When the fusion protein was tested against synthetic phosphoinositide substrates it was able to phosphorylate PtdIns but not PtdIns3P, PtdIns4P, or PtdIns5P (results not shown). Kinetic analysis of the GST fusion protein using the Lineweaver-Burk method gave Km values of 28 and 54 μm for ATP and PtdIns, respectively, which fall within the range of previously published values (see Ref. 12Wetzker R. Klinger R. Hsuan J. Fry M.J. Kauffmann Z.A. Muller E. Frunder H. Waterfield M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar and references therein). The specific activity of the GST fusion protein was ∼3.3 nmol/min/mg; this is low compared with the enzyme purified from various primary tissues (see Ref. 12Wetzker R. Klinger R. Hsuan J. Fry M.J. Kauffmann Z.A. Muller E. Frunder H. Waterfield M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar and references therein) and may reflect differences in post-translational modification or incorrect folding. The recombinant enzyme was activated 32-fold by 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 5 C) and inhibited by adenosine with an IC50 of 22 μm (Fig. 5 D). Activation by 0.1% Triton X-100 and inhibition by adenosine in the micromolar range are characteristic properties of PtdIns4K II purified from mammalian tissues (4Pike L.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 692-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The GST fusion protein was also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the monoclonal antibody 4C5G (Fig. 5 E), which is another characteristic property of PtdIns4K II that distinguishes it from the type III PtdIns4K isoforms (35Endemann, G. C., Graziani, A. & Cantley, L. C. (1991)Biochem. J.Google Scholar). The successful purification of PtdIns4K II in sufficient quantity for sequencing depended on an understanding of the membrane rafting of this enzyme (24Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Tan S.K. Hsuan J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17115-17121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The purification of these rafts and their efficient solubilization allowed the development of a rapid, small-scale purification of the PtdIns4K II enzyme from cultured cells. The mechanism of PtdIns4K II and PI rafting remains unclear, but it appears to be required for receptor-dependent signal transduction (25Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Because of a lack of specific diagnostic reagents, PtdIns4K II activity is typically characterized by its activation by non-ionic detergents and inhibition by adenosine and the monoclonal antibody 4C5G (4Pike L.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 692-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Whitman M. Kaplan D. Roberts T. Cantley L. Biochem.

The recombinant enzyme displayed identical properties to those reported for the purified enzyme; GST-PtdInsPK IIα was activated by Triton X-100 and inhibited by low concentrations of adenosine and by 4C5G. As the PtdIns4K IIα enzyme defines a novel sequence family, it should be clearly distinguished from the previously cloned PtdIns4K α (14Wong K. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28878-28884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PtdIns4K β (15Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12088-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) isozymes, as well as the PI3K and PtdInsPK families. PtdIns4K α, PtdIns4K β, and the type III PtdIns4K belong in the PI3K family. We propose to maintain the type II assignation for PtdIns4K II, at least until the structural and functional range of homologous enzymes is clearer, and to name the human isoform purified in this report and the second isoform identified by data base searches PtdIns4K IIα and PtdIns4K IIβ, respectively. The lack of sequence similarity in the amino-terminal region of the PtdIns4K IIα and PtdIns4K IIβ proteins suggests this region may confer functional specificity, for example by mediating differential localization, allostery, or regulation via post-translational modification. The existence of a single PtdInsPK II homologue in S. cerevisiae is worth noting, as the type III homologues, PIK1 and STT4, have been proposed to account for all of the PtdIns4K activity in these cells (36Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Although a type II-like PtdIns4K had previously been partially purified from S. cerevisiae (37Nickels J.J. Buxeda R.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16297-16304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the implication was that this was an alternatively spliced or degraded product of the type III genes. It remains to be shown whether the yeast and other PtdIns4K II homologues possess PtdIns4K activity. In summary, the identification of the PtdIns4K IIα cDNA sequence has defined a novel family of PI kinases. It is now possible to use recombinant approaches to provide specific reagents able to address numerous questions regarding the function of PtdIns4K II, including the possible functional degeneracy between the different PtdIns4K enzymes. Furthermore an important step has been taken toward obtaining a molecular definition of the reported rafting, regulation, complex formation, and biological function of this enzyme in health and disease.

The EGF-TM7 group comprises mouse F4/80, human EGF module-containing mucin-like hormone receptor (EMR) 1, human EMR2, and human and mouse CD97, the genes for which map to human chromosome 19p13 and the syntenic regions of the mouse genome. In this study we describe the cloning and characterization of EMR3, a novel human EGF-TM7 molecule, and show the existence of its cellular ligand. The EMR3 gene maps closely to the existing members of the EGF-TM7 family on human chromosome 19p13.1 and, in common with other EGF-TM7 genes, is capable of generating different protein isoforms through alternative splicing. Two alternative splice forms have been isolated: one encoding a 652-amino acid cell surface protein consisting of two EGF-like domains, a mucin stalk, and a putative G-protein-coupled receptor domain and the other encoding a truncated soluble form containing only two EGF-like domains. As with other members of the EGF-TM7 family, EMR3 mRNA displays a predominantly leukocyte-restricted expression pattern, with highest levels in neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. Through the use of soluble EMR3 multivalent probes we have shown the presence of a ligand at the surface of monocyte-derived macrophages and activated human neutrophils.

Many crucial processes such as chemotaxis and migration, pathogen recognition and phagocytosis, inflammation, and microbial killing are mediated in part by the vast repertoire of leukocyte cell surface receptors. One rapidly growing group of receptors that may be involved in such processes is that of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)1-TM7 family (1Stacey M. Lin H.H. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. Trends Biochem.

These predominantly leukocyte-restricted glycoproteins are defined by their unique chimeric structures, which consist of varying numbers of N-terminal EGF-like repeats coupled to a family B G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-related moiety via a mucin-like stalk (Fig. 1). The founding member of the EGF-TM7 family, F4/80, comprises seven EGF-like domains, a spacer region, and a hydrophobic seven-span transmembrane (TM7) region. As a result of its macrophage-restricted expression, F4/80 has long been used as an excellent marker for populations of mouse tissue macrophages. EMR1, the likely human homologue of F4/80, possesses six EGF-like domains and shares 68% overall amino acid identity with its murine counterpart. CD97, a B and T cell activation antigen, is expressed constitutively by human granulocytes and monocytes and at low levels by resting T and B cells and is markedly and rapidly up-regulated upon T and B cell activation. CD97 occurs on the cell surface as three major isoforms resulting from alternative RNA splicing. All CD97 isoforms have been shown to bind to a membrane protein of the complement system, CD55 (DAF); however, the isoform containing three EGF-like domains binds with higher affinity to CD55 than the other isoforms. More recently, human EMR2 has been cloned that contains EGF-like domains that are highly homologous to those of CD97. Similarly, EMR2 RNA undergoes alternative splicing; however, the isoforms appear to be more myeloid-restricted and are known not to interact with CD55.The EGF-like domain, like those found in EGF-TM7 proteins, is a common structural module often occurring as tandem repeats in extracellular proteins involved in cellular adhesion, receptor-ligand interactions, and blood coagulation. EGF-like domains consist of ∼50 amino acids and are defined by six conserved cysteine residues that form three intra-domain disulfide bonds. A subset of EGF-like domains contains a Ca2+-binding consensus sequence, (D/N)X(D/N)(E/Q)X m(D/N*)X n(Y/F) (where m and n are variable, and * indicates possible β-hydroxylation) (9Handford P.

Chelated Ca2+ performs a key role in the orientation of EGF-like pairs by restricting flexibility of the interdomain linkage, thus allowing the presentation of specific surfaces for protein-protein interactions to occur (10Downing A.K.

The importance of EGF-like domains is demonstrated by natural mutations in the genes encoding fibrillin-1, low density lipoprotein receptor, factor IX, and protein S, which are responsible for Marfan syndrome, familial hypercholesterolemia, hemophilia B, and protein S deficiency, respectively (11Dietz H.C.

GPCRs constitute the largest gene superfamily within the genome and have been shown to mediate a range of cellular responses to an extensive array of stimuli including peptides, amino acid derivatives, lipid analogues, ions, and external sensory stimuli such as light, taste, and odors through intracellular signaling (15Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar).Based upon the restricted expression and hybrid structure of EGF-TM7 family members, it has been suggested that these cell surface proteins may play a significant role within the immune system, mediating adhesion through their EGF-like repeats with concomitant intracellular signaling via the GPCR moiety. Although signaling in these molecules has yet to be demonstrated, CD97 has been shown to bind to a membrane protein of the complement system, CD55 (DAF), demonstrating its role in cell-cell interactions (16Hamann J. Vogel B. Van Schijndel G.M. van Lier R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1185-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar).In this study we describe the cloning and characterization of human EMR3, a new member of the EGF-TM7 family. The EMR3 gene maps closely to other members of the EGF-TM7 group on human chromosome 19p13.1 and encodes a leukocyte-restricted protein expressed predominantly on neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. Multivalent EMR3 probes were used to demonstrate the presence of a cell surface ligand for EMR3 on both monocyte-derived macrophages and activated human neutrophils, suggesting a potential role for EMR3 in myeloid cell interactions.RESULTSIn a search for novel members of the EGF-TM7 group of leukocyte receptors, DNA sequence data bases were screened for expressed sequence tags or genomic clones that displayed sequence homology with existing EGF-TM7 family members. A cosmid clone (R29368) derived from human chromosome 19 DNA (GenBankTM accession number AC004262) demonstrated ∼50% amino acid identity to the first transmembrane domain and membrane proximal region of F4/80, EMR1, and CD97. The cosmid sequence was therefore used for primer design (E1–4) (see “Experimental Procedures”) in subsequent 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions. Using human spleen cDNA template and primers E1–4 plus AP1 and AP2 anchor sequences, two novel EGF-TM7 molecules designated EMR2 (8Lin H.-H. Stacey M. Hamann J. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. Genomics. 2000; 67: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and EMR3 were independently isolated. The EMR2 DNA sequence was found to match the R29368 cosmid sequence, whereas the EMR3 DNA sequence suggests that the gene-specific primers misprimed, resulting in the amplification of a closely related, yet independent cDNA species.The full-length EMR3 cDNA (Fig. 2) is comprised of 2247 nucleotides encoding a predicted 652-amino acid polypeptide. Based on the protein analysis programs from the Expasy server, the EMR3 sequence is predicted to contain a 21-amino acid signal peptide (residues 1–21) and two EGF-like domains (residues 25–66 and 67–118), with the N-terminal EGF-like domain being a non-Ca2+-binding module and the second EGF-like domain containing a Ca2+-binding consensus sequence. The EGF-like domains are followed by a spacer region (residues 118–350) containing several potential N- and O-linked glycosylation sites, a putative GPCR proteolytic site (20Lelianova V.G. Davletov B.A. Sterling A. Rahman M.A. Grishin E.V. Totty N.F. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21504-21508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), a family B GPCR-related TM7 region (residues 350–602), and a short cytoplasmic tail (residues 602–652).Figure 2Full-length cDNA and predicted amino acid sequence of EMR3.

This deletion, which corresponds to the splicing out of a single exon (data obtained from a partial genomic clone; GenBankTM accession number AC0022156), results in a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon and the production of a truncated soluble form of EMR3 protein that comprises the two EGF-like domains of the molecule. Multiple sequence alignment using the ClustalW software shows EMR3 to be most closely related to EMR2, followed by other members of the EGF-TM7 group of molecules: F4/80, EMR1, and CD97 (Fig.3). The TM7 region of EMR3 shows ∼90% sequence identity to EMR2, whereas the sequence identity in the stalk regions and EGF-like domains is ∼35 and 50%, respectively.Figure 3Amino acid sequence alignment of existing human EGF-TM7 proteins.

Northern blot analysis of EMR3 identified two major transcripts at 2.4 and 4 kilobases expressed at high levels in immune tissues (spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood leukocytes) and at much lower levels in the placenta and lung (Fig. 4 a). RT-PCR was performed using primers from the 5′ untranslated region (sense) and the stalk region (antisense) of EMR3 and gave similar results to the Northern blot data (Fig.4 b). Highest levels of expression were again observed in the spleen, peripheral blood leukocytes, and lung, followed by intermediate levels in the placenta and bone marrow, with low detected levels in heart, kidney, liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle, lymph node, thymus, tonsil, and fetal liver. EMR3 expression was not detected in the brain.Figure 4EMR3 expression is restricted predominantly to immune tissues. a, Northern blot showing EMR3 mRNA expression profile in various human tissues. b, RT-PCR results of a cDNA panel from various human tissues using a primer pair from the 5′ untranslated region and stalk region of EMR3.c, Northern blot of total RNA from fractionated human blood cell populations probed with an EMR3-specific cDNA fragment.d, RNA from various human hemopoietic and non-hemopoietic cells was used as a template for RT-PCR using EMR3-specific primers and β2-microglobulin (β2M)-specific primers.kb, kilobases; PMN, polymorphonuclear cells; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To dissect the expression profile of EMR3 mRNA in peripheral blood cells further, RT-PCR was performed on RNA samples from eight hemopoietic cell lines and, as negative controls, two human fibroblast cell lines (Fig. 4 d). Following 30 cycles of PCR amplification, EMR3 expression was undetectable in all of the cell lines; however, after 40 cycles of amplification EMR3 expression was detected in two monocyte/macrophage cell lines (HL60 and U937), two B cell lines (Daudi and H9), and one T cell line (Jurkat). No signal was detected in the other cell lines, including the non-hemopoietic cell line HepG2 and 293 cells. To allow further examination of the expression profile in peripheral blood leukocytes, RNA was extracted from fractionated blood including polymorphonuclear cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and lymphocytes from healthy donors and used in subsequent Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4 c). The blot shows that the vast majority of the EMR3 hybridization signal is derived from the polymorphonuclear cell fraction, which contains mainly neutrophils, with a small number of eosinophils and basophils. Much lower levels of EMR3 expression were detected in freshly isolated monocytes and cultured macrophages, whereas no expression was observed in the RNA isolated from lymphocytes.It has been well documented that many of the cell-cell interactions within the immune system are of low affinity and transient in nature (21van der Merwe P.A. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4945-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As such, when screening for such interactions, it is often necessary to use multivalent probes to increase the avidity of the molecular association to allow detection. In a search for the cellular ligand(s) of EMR3, a previously established sensitive assay system was utilized for screening cells that may express potential ligand(s). Recombinant soluble EMR3 containing a biotinylation sequence recognized by the E. Coli enzyme BirA (Fig.5 a) was biotinylated in vitro and coupled to avidin-coated fluorescent beads (22Brown M.H. Preston S. Barclay A.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3222-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The multivalent fluorescent bead-biotinylated EMR3 complex (Fig.5 b) was then used as a ligand probe in a FACS-based assay. Fluorescent beads coated with CD97 (EGF-1,2,5 isoform) and EMR2 (EGF-1,2 isoform) were also produced and served as binding and non-binding controls, respectively. Because of the high level of EMR3 expression in peripheral blood leukocytes, as measured by RNA analysis, various cell types were isolated from healthy donors by Polymorphprep™ separation and subsequently screened for interactions with the multivalent EMR3 probe. Following the incubation of human erythrocytes with CD97-multivalent fluorescent beads, a predicted shift in fluorescence was observed (Fig. 5 c). This indicated that the CD97-coated fluorescent beads effectively bound to the CD97 cellular ligand CD55, which is known to be expressed at high levels on erythrocytes and other cells in the blood. In contrast, the FACS profiles of the EMR3- and the EMR2-coated fluorescent beads showed no shift in fluorescence, indicating no detectable interactions with human erythrocyte cell surface molecules (Fig. 5 c). Similarly, no shift in fluorescence was detected when EMR3-coated fluorescent beads were incubated with either resting polymorphonuclear cells or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Fig. 5, d andf). However, a significant shift in fluorescence was observed when EMR3-coated fluorescent beads were incubated with monocyte-derived macrophages and activated neutrophils following their exposure to 100 nm formyl-Met-Leu-Phe for 30 min (Fig. 5,e and d). These results indicate the presence of a ligand for EMR3 that is up-regulated on monocyte-derived macrophages and human neutrophils following activation. Both the monocyte-derived macrophages and the activated neutrophils failed to interact with EMR2-coated beads, proving the specificity of the interaction between EMR3 and a molecule on the surface of the myeloid cells.Figure 5Demonstration of an EMR3 ligand on human macrophages and activated neutrophils. a, soluble EMR3 protein containing an amino acid consensus sequence recognized by the BirA enzyme allowing in vitro biotinylation of the lysine residue (*). b, multivalent EMR3 probes produced by coupling soluble biotinylated proteins to avidin-coated fluorescent beads.c–f, FACS profiles of fluorescent beads coated with EMR3, CD97 (EGF-1,2,5), or EMR2 (EGF-1,2) incubated with erythrocytes, resting and formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-activated neutrophils, monocyte-derived macrophages, and lymphocytes, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe data presented show EMR3 to possess the typical characteristics displayed by other EGF-TM7 proteins. The EMR3 gene is located on chromosome 19 and is capable of encoding different EMR3 protein isoforms through alternative RNA splicing. This results in the production of a predominantly leukocyte-restricted cell surface protein comprised of two EGF-like domains coupled to a seven-span transmembrane moiety via a mucin-like spacer region as well as its soluble secreted counterpart lacking both the transmembrane and stalk regions. In addition to these data, a sensitive FACS-based assay system using multivalent EMR3 fluorescent beads as a ligand probe demonstrated the presence of an EMR3 ligand on both human monocyte-derived macrophages and activated human neutrophils.As with existing members of the EGF-TM7 family, RT-PCR data and Northern blot analysis show EMR3 to be leukocyte-restricted (Fig. 4). In Northern analysis of fractionated human blood, the majority of EMR3 signal is derived from polymorphonuclear cells (Fig. 4 c). The main cellular components of this isolated fraction are neutrophils; however, a signal from the lower number of eosinophils and basophils cannot be ruled out. Lower levels of EMR3 mRNA were also detected in monocytes and culture-derived macrophages, suggesting that EMR3 is a myeloid-restricted molecule. The future development of EMR3-specific antibodies will greatly facilitate further characterization of expression within these cells. Once such antibodies are available, it would be interesting to show whether EMR3 is present in intracellular vesicles such as storage granules or mainly at the cell surface and to determine whether the activation state of polymorphonuclear cells, macrophages, or monocytes affects the levels or distribution of EMR3.The significance of the interaction between EMR3 and monocyte-derived macrophages and activated neutrophils detected by FACS has yet to be established. However, because the majority of EMR3 is shown to be expressed by myeloid cells such as neutrophils and macrophages (Fig.4), the interaction could play an important role in modulating immune and inflammatory responses by allowing “cross-talk” between myeloid cells. The ligation of EMR3 with a ligand on macrophages and activated neutrophils could potentially activate or deactivate cellular responses. Resting neutrophils and macrophages might be activated via signal transduction through the GPCR moiety of EMR3 following ligand binding, thereby amplifying immune and inflammatory responses, or signaling could possibly occur in the opposite direction. The binding of the EMR3 ligand to EMR3 could result in the modulation of macrophages and activated neutrophils, thereby reducing inflammatory cell-mediated tissue damage as a result of negative signaling.The exact nature of the EMR3 ligand is not yet known; however, a related member of the EGF-TM7 family, CD97, is known to bind CD55 (DAF), which belongs to the regulators of complement activation family of proteins that are involved in the prevention of complement-mediated lysis of healthy cells. Although EMR3 does not bind CD55, other candidate proteins containing similar short consensus repeat domains include CD46 (membrane cofactor protein), CD35 (CR1), and CD21 (CR2) (23Liszewski M.K. Farries T.C. Lublin D.M. Rooney I.A. Atkinson J.P. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 61: 201-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The further biochemical characterization of EMR3 ligand is underway.Because the multivalent EMR3 probes were produced with soluble EMR3, it raises the question whether membrane anchoring of EMR3 is necessary for ligand binding in vivo. Indeed, an EMR3 cDNA clone containing a 40-nucleotide deletion has also been isolated that is predicted to encode a soluble form of EMR3 lacking the transmembrane domains and the mucin-like region. The presence of a putative GPCR proteolytic site in EMR3 (residues 320–345) as defined by Krasnoperovet al. (27Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) gives further weight to the possibility that a soluble form of EMR3 mediates receptor ligation. The GPCR proteolytic site sequence is believed to be defined by a highly conserved pattern of Cys residues and a Leu-Thr site that was initially identified in a sperm receptor for egg jelly in sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) (24Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). More recently, the site has been shown to be involved in the cleavage of the extracellular domains of CD97 and latrophilin (CL1) (25Gray J.X. Haino M. Roth M.J. Maguire J.E. Jensen P.N. Yarme A. Stetler-Stevenson M.A. Siebenlist U. Kelly K. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5438-5447PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sugita S. Ichtchenko K. Khvotchev M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), resulting in the formation of membrane-associated heterodimers in which the transmembrane domains are non-covalently associated with the extracellular domains. This has led to the suggestion that the subsequent release of the extracellular domains could then allow interaction with ligands on neighboring cells and at the same time allow the binding of other ligands such as peptide hormones to the GPCR moiety of the EGF-TM7 proteins.The cluster of closely related EGF-TM7 genes on human chromosome 19p13 and on the syntenic regions of the mouse genome suggests an ancient gene family that has arisen through gene duplication and exon shuffling (28Carver E.A. Hamann J. Olsen A.S. Stubbs L. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1039-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Indeed, the serendipitous discovery of EMR3 during the initial cloning of EMR2 was due to the fact that there is a greater than 90% identity within the exons encoding the transmembrane domains of EMR2 (exons 14–19) and EMR3 (8Lin H.-H. Stacey M. Hamann J. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. Genomics. 2000; 67: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, despite the very high degree of sequence identity shared by EMR3 and EMR2 within their transmembrane domains, the two molecules display much lower levels of identity within their mucin-like stalk regions and EGF-like domains (35 and 50%, respectively). This leads to the possibility of related proteins having different ligand binding properties, mediated through their extracellular regions, yet similar intracellular signaling, mediated via their GPCR moieties. The converse could also be postulated for two other EGF-TM7 proteins. Human CD97 and human EMR2 contain extremely similar EGF-like domains (differing by only six amino acids within the five EGF-like domains) yet possess much less similar transmembrane domain sequences. The temporal and spatial regulation of such receptors could allow differential intracellular signaling via the transmembrane domain to occur by the same ligand binding to the extracellular domain.With the complete sequencing and publication of the human genome in sight and the sequencing of the mouse genome well under way, it is interesting to speculate whether more EGF-TM7 genes reside on chromosome 19 or within the mouse genome. If more do exist, the cloning and characterization of these proteins and their ligands will facilitate our understanding of the physiological importance of the EGF-TM7 proteins within the immune system. Professional phagocytic cells such as neutrophils and macrophages play essential roles in a wide range of both immune and homeostatic functions. Many crucial processes such as chemotaxis and migration, pathogen recognition and phagocytosis, inflammation, and microbial killing are mediated in part by the vast repertoire of leukocyte cell surface receptors. One rapidly growing group of receptors that may be involved in such processes is that"

BesidesKES1, inactivating mutations in several other structural genes have been demonstrated to relieve the cell of it essential requirement for Sec14p and these include the following: (i) each of the enzymes in CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis, and (ii)SacIp, a PI-4-phosphate phosphatase (22Guo S.

Dove S.K. McDonald N.Q. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 801-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Additional experimentation demonstrated that increased expression ofKES1 in sec14ts yeast containing inactivating mutations in any of the enzymes of the CDP-choline pathway reversed the sec14 − bypass afforded by each of these mutations (11Fang M. Kearns B.G. Gedvilaite A. Kagiwada S. Kearns M. Fung M.K. Y Bankaitis V.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6447-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Therefore, Kes1p likely counterbalances Sec14p function, with both genes normally required to prevent toxicity of the CDP-choline pathway and Sac1p to Golgi-derived vesicle transport. To understand more precisely the functions and underlying mechanisms of mammalian OSBPs, we screened a human cDNA library and isolated the two members of the human OSBP family that most resemble yeast Kes1p. We purified the encoded proteins and demonstrated that neither could bind 25-hydroxycholesterol but instead bound phosphatidic acid (PA) with high affinity and phosphatidylinositol-3-P (PI-3-P) with weak affinity. Thus, these new proteins were termed oxysterol-binding protein-related proteins, ORP1 and ORP2. Expression of ORP1 in yeast reversed the bypass provided by inactivation of the KES1 gene in cells lacking a functional Sec14p, whereas ORP2 expression was unable to do so. Instead, overexpression of ORP2 resulted in the cessation of cell growth in wild type yeast, and this correlated with a block in vesicle transport within the Golgi. ORP2-mediated cell growth inhibition was more extreme in cells lacking a functional Kes1p implying Kes1p/ORP1 shares a biological function with ORP2. Expression of ORP1- and ORP2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells localized ORP1 to a cytosolic compartment and ORP2 to the Golgi apparatus. Standard molecular biology methods, yeast genetic techniques, and transformation methods were used (24Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar,25Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual.

Yeast complex medium supplemented to a final glucose concentration of 2% (YPD) and synthetic minimal media have been described (25Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Tran35S-labeled methionine/cysteine mixture was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse conjugated antibodies were from Bio-Rad. The enhanced chemiluminescence kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All phospholipids were products of Avanti Polar Lipids, except the phosphoinositides that were purchased from both Matreya and Biomol. Similar results were obtained using lipids from either source. Pure protein kinase Cα was purchased from Biomol. The yeast wild type strains w303-1a (a ura3-1 his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ade2-1 can1-100), w303-1A (α ura3-1 his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ade2-1 can1-100), and the sec14ts strain CTY1-1A (a ura3-52 Δhis3-200 lys2-801 sec14ts) have been described (17Cleves A.E.

CTY1–1A was crossed with w303-1A, and haploid progeny were isolated to create asec14ts yeast strain that can grow on media-containing galactose as the main carbon source, CMY102 (a ura3 his3 trp1 leu2 sec14ts GAL+). AKES1 one-step gene disruption vector was constructed in pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene) by introducing a HIS3genomic fragment into the EcoRI site of the KES1gene. The recombinant DNA fragment was linearized with ApaI and EcoRV and transformed into yeast strain CMY102 to create strain CMY136 (a ura3 his3 trp1 leu2 sec14-1ts kes1::HIS3 GAL + ). Recombinants were initially identified based on histidine prototrophy and the ability to grow at 37 °C. Thekes1::HIS3 genomic disruption was confirmed by Southern analysis and PCR (24Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 25Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). A tBLASTn search of the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base revealed five separate groups of cDNAs that were similar to yeast Kes1p and human OSBP1. Two of these groups consisted of cDNAs predicted to contain only the ligand binding domain. One group contained only partial cDNAs, and a full-length ORP1 cDNA was isolated from an oligo(dT)-primed human brain cDNA library (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the Gene Trapper positive selection system (Life Technologies, Inc.). A 25-mer oligonucleotide was synthesized based on the most 5′ EST DNA sequence, and this oligonucleotide was used to enrich for novel ORP1 cDNAs. A total of 1000–2000 colonies from the enriched cDNA library were screened using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide designed from the partial cDNA sequence. Positive clones with large inserts were subsequently sequenced by automated dye-termination DNA sequencing. A full-length ORP1 cDNA was isolated subsequent to several rounds of enrichment and colony hybridization using oligonucleotides designed from the emerging upstream novel DNA sequences. The second OSBP homologue that contained only the ligand binding domain, ORP2, was obtained full-length from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Kisarazu, Japan). The full open reading frames of human ORP1 and ORP2 were amplified by PCR using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). After additional incubation with Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) to add deoxyadenosine tails, the PCR products were subcloned into pcDNA2.1-Topo (Invitrogen). The integrity of the entire ORP1 and ORP2 amplified sequences was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The open reading frames were subsequently subcloned into the yeast pESC-URA expression vector (Invitrogen). The pESC-URA vector contains theGAL1 promoter upstream of the open reading frames for regulated expression of human ORP1 and ORP2 proteins by substituting galactose for glucose as carbon source. The open reading frames were also subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) resulting in the addition of the coding sequence for GFP in frame with the 3′ end of ORP1 and ORP2. The open reading frames were also subcloned into the Escherichia coliexpression vector pET23b (Novagen) resulting in the addition of a His6 tag to the C terminus of the expressed protein. For the yeast growth assay, a single colony from each of the yeast strains was grown overnight in defined media containing the appropriate nutrients to ensure plasmid maintenance. Yeast cell concentration was estimated by measuring absorbance at 600 nm, and the identical number of cells was removed from each culture. These cells were washed in minimal media containing 2% galactose substituted as carbon source; a series of 1:4 dilutions were made, and 1 μl of each dilution was spotted onto minimal media agar plates containing glucose and/or galactose and the appropriate nutrients to ensure plasmid maintenance. Cells were incubated at either 25 or 37 °C for 3–4 days. The CPY assay was carried out essentially as described (27Gaynor E.V. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in defined media containing the required nutrients to ensure plasmid maintenance, but 2% galactose was substituted as carbon source (to induce human ORP1 or ORP2 expression). Cells were back inoculated to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.4 and grown for 6–8 h. Aliquots of cells (absorbance at 600 nm of 3.0) were resuspended in fresh media and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Cells were then labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 10 min, and then unlabeled methionine and cysteine were added to the reaction media (subsequent to 10 min of radiolabeling) to final concentrations of 0.5% each. The cells were incubated for an additional 0–60 min, and the labeling reaction was terminated by transferring samples to tubes containing 10 mm NaF in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were disrupted by agitation with glass beads and cellular proteins after pelleting cell debris by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. CPY was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant using a polyclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Scott Emr, University of California, San Diego) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved using 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gel was exposed to x-ray film for subsequent development. ORP1 and ORP2 in the pET23b plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) pLysS E. coli and transformant-selected on medium containing 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. Transformants were grown in the same medium to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.6, and transcription of ORP1 and ORP2 was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Cells were lysed with lysozyme and purified with Talon (CLONTECH) resin using imidazole buffers as described by the manufacturer. Purified protein were dialyzed overnightversus phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE analysis and Coomassie staining of the purified protein preparations estimated a purity of greater than 95% homogeneity. The human ORP1 coding sequence for the C-terminal 100 amino acids was fused in frame to the coding region for glutathione S-transferase in theE. coli expression vector pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified using glutathione resin as directed by the manufacturer, and the purified fusion protein was used for antibody generation. ORP2 antibodies were raised against the peptide CQERRGDHLRKAKLDEDSGKADSD coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (New England Peptide). The purified GST-ORP1 protein chimera and the ORP2-coupled peptide were injected into rabbits subcutaneously by the Dalhousie University Carleton Animal Care staff for the production of ORP1 and ORP2 antibodies. Pure ORP1 and ORP2 proteins and COS-7 extracts of overexpressed recombinant proteins were analyzed for 25-hydroxycholesterol binding exactly as described (4Dawson P.A. Ridgway N.D. Slaughter C.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16798-16803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard phospholipid binding assays were performed as described (29Dowler S. Currie R.A. Campbell D.G. Deak M. Kular G. Downes P.C. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) by immobilizing 100 pmol of pure phospholipid on Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Pure protein preparations of ORP1, ORP2, or protein kinase Cα (10 pmol/ml) were allowed to bind to the immobilized lipids by incubating the lipid blots with the purified proteins in the presence of Tris-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 12 h. Blots were washed with blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 (w/v) and incubated with ORP1, ORP2, or protein kinase Cα primary antibodies (1:1000) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, washed twice, and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies (1:10,000) coupled to horseradish peroxidase, washed six times with blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 (w/v), and subsequently developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and 34 μg/ml proline. Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and transfected with pEGFP-ORP1 or pEGFP-ORP2 using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Thirty hours after transfection cells were fixed in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 225 mm NaCl, and 2 mmMgCl2 (PBS) containing 3% (w/v) formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Following two washes in PBS containing 5 mm ammonium chloride, cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature, washed twice with PBS containing 1% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in PBS containing 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. To stain the Golgi apparatus, cells were incubated in PBS containing 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin containing 10 μg/ml Lens culinaris (8Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) lectin coupled to Texas Red (EY Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS containing 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and mounted on microscope slides with 90% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), and 2.5% 1,4-diazadicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane. To stain the endoplasmic reticulum, cells were incubated in PBS containing 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin containing mouse monoclonal antibodies to protein disulfide isomerase (Stressgen) at a 1:500 dilution followed by a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody coupled to Texas Red (1:4000). To disrupt the Golgi apparatus, cells were treated with brefeldin A (2 μg/ml) for 30 min prior to the fixation step. TheKES1 gene of yeast had been previously isolated based on the observation that inactivating mutations of KES1 resulted in cells that were able to bypass the essential requirement of a PC/PI transfer protein, Sec14p (17Cleves A.E.

Sec14p is necessary for vesicle trafficking competence from the late Golgi to the cell surface and yeast vacuole (functional equivalent of the mammalian lysosome) (12Novick P. Field C. Schekman R.

This role in vesicle trafficking was demonstrated to be specific to Kes1p as genetic inactivation of the other members of the yeast OSBP family were unable to relieve yeast cells of the requirement for a functional Sec14p (11Fang M. Kearns B.G. Gedvilaite A. Kagiwada S. Kearns M. Fung M.K. Y Bankaitis V.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6447-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The only characterized mammalian OSBP is OSBP1, a protein that consists of a ligand binding domain similar to that of Kes1p but also has a large N-terminal extension containing a PH domain, a Gly/Ala-rich region. OSBP1 translocates to the Golgi apparatus from a cytoplasmic vesicular compartment and has been demonstrated to regulate flux through the sterol and phospholipid biosynthetic pathways through as yet unknown mechanisms (3Ridgway N.D.

We searched the human expressed sequence tags (EST) data base using sequences from the ligand binding region of human OSBP1 and yeast Kes1p for mammalian ESTs that were predicted to contain only the ligand binding domain portion of the OSBP family. Two different classes of OSBP encoding cDNAs were identified. An alignment of one class of EST sequences with similarity to the ligand binding region of OSBP1 and Kes1p demonstrated that there were no full-length cDNAs represented. We employed a positive cDNA selection system to screen libraries for a full-length human cDNA. After several rounds of library enrichment, colony hybridization, restriction analysis, and cDNA walking, we isolated a new member of the OSBP family of proteins that we termed ORP1 (OSBP-related Protein, GenBankTM accession number AF274714). DNA sequencing revealed an insert of 3.3 kilobase pairs in size that contained an internal 1.3-kilobase pair open reading frame. Stop codons were found in all three reading frames upstream of the predicted initiator Met codon. The second member of the OSBP family that contained only the ligand binding domain contained ESTs that were predicted to be full length. One of these was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Kisarazu, Japan) and was sequenced in its entirety (GenBankTM accession number AY028168). The ORP1 open reading frame codes for a protein of 437 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 46 kDa, whereas ORP2 predicts a 468-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 53 kDa (Fig.1). The proteins do not contain any predicted membrane spanning domains, nor were there any recognizable sorting sequences or functional motifs. SEC14 is an essential yeast gene that codes for a PI/PC transfer protein necessary for vesicle trafficking from the late Golgi to the cell surface and the vacuole (lysosome) (12Novick P. Field C.

Mice lacking this enzyme (Pcmt1−/− mice) have elevated levels of damaged residues and die at a mean age of 42 days from massive tonic-clonic seizures. To extend the lives of the knockout mice so that the long term effects of damaged residue accumulation could be investigated, we produced transgenic mice with a mouse Pcmt1 cDNA under the control of a neuron-specific promoter. Pcmt1 transgenic mice that were homozygous for the endogenous Pcmt1 knockout mutation (“transgenic Pcmt1−/− mice”) had brain PCMT1 activity levels that were 6.5–13% those of wild-type mice but had little or no activity in other tissues. The transgenicPcmt1−/− mice lived, on average, 5-fold longer than nontransgenic Pcmt1−/− mice and accumulated only half as many damaged aspartyl residues in their brain proteins. The concentration of damaged residues in heart, testis, and brain proteins in transgenic Pcmt1−/− mice initially increased with age but unexpectedly reached a plateau by 100 days of age. Urine fromPcmt1−/− mice contained increased amounts of peptides with damaged aspartyl residues, apparently enough to account for proteins that were not repaired intracellularly. In the absence of PCMT1, proteolysis may limit the intracellular accumulation of damaged proteins but less efficiently than in wild-type mice having PCMT1-mediated repair. l-Isoaspartyl (d-aspartyl) O-methyltransferase (PCMT1) can initiate the conversion of damaged aspartyl and asparaginyl residues to normal l-aspartyl residues.

Local protein structure causes some l-aspartyl and l-asparaginyl residues to be especially prone to succinimide formation, and the presence of damaged aspartyl residues at these sites can significantly alter the structure, function, and immunogenicity of the protein (10Aswad D.W. Paranandi M.V. Schurter B.T. J. Pharmacol. Biomed. Anal. 2000; 21: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13Mamula M.J. Gee R.J. Elliott J.I. Sette A. Southwood S. Jones P.J. Blier P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22321-22327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To minimize the accumulation of damaged aspartyl residues in cellular proteins, all mammalian tissues possess an l-isoaspartyl (d-aspartyl) O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77; designated PCMT11 in mice) (14Clarke S. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1999: 123-148Crossref Google Scholar). This enzyme uses S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to methylate l-isoaspartyl (and, less efficiently,d-aspartyl) residues but not normal l-aspartyl residues (15Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Aswad D.W. Deamidation and Isoaspartate Formation in Peptides and Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 47-64Google Scholar). Nonenzymatic deesterification of the methylated residues returns them to the succinimide form much more rapidly than occurs in the absence of methylation, resulting in the eventual conversion of most of the damaged residues to the “repaired”l-aspartyl form (16McFadden P.N. Clarke S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2595-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 17Johnson B.A. Murray Jr., E.D. Clarke S. Glass D.B. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5622-5629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological importance of this pathway remained unclear untilPcmt1 knockout (Pcmt1−/−) mice were created and found to display a distinctive phenotype (18Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 19Yamamoto A. Takagi H. Kitamura D. Tatsuoka H. Nakano H. Kawano H. Kuroyanagi H.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2063-2074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Pcmt1−/− mice have 2–6-fold higher levels of damaged aspartyl residues in their brain, heart, liver, and erythrocytes than are observed in wild-type tissues (18Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Furthermore,Pcmt1−/− mice are smaller than their Pcmt1+/−and Pcmt1+/+ littermates, undergo severe tonic-clonic seizures, and die at an average age of 42 days (18Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 19Yamamoto A. Takagi H. Kitamura D. Tatsuoka H. Nakano H. Kawano H. Kuroyanagi H.

Electroencephalographic analysis shows that these mice suffer abnormal brain activity about 50% of the time, not just during the tonic-clonic seizures (20Kim E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20671-20678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Administration of the anti-seizure drug valproic acid enabled Pcmt1−/− mice to attain the same size and weight as their wild-type littermates, suggesting that the absence of the methyltransferase did not interfere directly with food intake or metabolism (20Kim E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20671-20678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The combination of valproic acid and clonazepam prolonged mean survival but only by 36 days (20Kim E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20671-20678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These results have raised new questions. Does the repair methyltransferase, although expressed in all tissues, have particular importance within the brain? Is it important in neurons or in nonneuronal cell types? If the seizures in the Pcmt1−/−mice were prevented, would other organs function abnormally as damaged aspartyl residues accumulated? In the current study, we have approached these questions by producing transgenic mice that express Pcmt1 solely within neurons. A rat neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter was used to direct the expression of mousePcmt1 cDNA in the brains of transgenic mice. The methyltransferase coding sequence (including 119 base pairs of 5′-noncoding and 777 base pairs of 3′-noncoding sequence) was obtained from a 1580-base pair murine testis cDNA clone (21Romanik E.A. Ladino C.A. Killoy L.C. D'Ardenne S.C. O'Connor C.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 118: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and was removed from plasmid sequences with EcoRI. The proximal rat NSE promoter was isolated from the plasmid NSE-APP695 (22Higgins L.S. Catalano R. Quon D. Cordell B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 695: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) after digestion with HindIII. After overhangs were filled with Klenow polymerase, the mouse Pcmt1 cDNA and the rat NSE vector were ligated, and the NSE-Pcmt1 transgenic construct was isolated by digestion with SalI. The transgene (2 ng/μl) was microinjected into F2 C57BL/6 × SJL fertilized mouse eggs by standard techniques (23Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). From 37 microinjected eggs, 33 pups were obtained, and 4 harbored the Pcmt1 transgene. These transgenic founders were identified by polymerase chain reaction with primers corresponding to mouse Pcmt1 cDNA sequences (5′-GCCAGCCACTCGGAGCTAATCC-3′ from exon 1 and 5′-CCACTATTTCCAACCATCCGTGC-3′ from exons 4 and 5). Southern blot analysis of tail DNA confirmed the integration of the transgene (Fig.1). Two of these mice, founders 27 and 29, were bred with C57BL/6 × 129/SvJae mice that were heterozygous for a knockout mutation in the endogenous Pcmt1gene (18Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). DNA samples from the tails of these mice were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction, both to detect the transgene and to detect the knockout mutation. Mice that were heterozygous for the knockout mutation and hemizygous for the transgene were selected for breeding. All mice were weaned at 21 days of age, housed in a barrier facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle, and fed a chow diet. Brain, heart, liver, kidney, and testis were removed immediately from sacrificed animals and placed in ice-cold buffer (5 ml/g wet weight) containing 250 mmsucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm disodium EDTA, pH 7.4, and the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (25 μm). The tissues were disrupted in a glass homogenization tube with a Teflon pestle rotating at 310 rpm for four 10-s intervals. The homogenates were placed in 1.5-ml tubes and centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant fractions contained both cytosolic proteins and microsomes and were kept frozen until used. Whole blood (100–200 μl) was taken from the tail or heart and combined with 200 μl of 2 mg/ml disodium EDTA, 10 mmsodium phosphate, 137.9 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4. Erythrocytes were collected by centrifugation at 4000 ×g for 4 min and washed four times with 1 ml of the above buffer. Pelleted erythrocytes were lysed in 5 volumes of 5 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm disodium EDTA, pH 7.4, and 25 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were centrifuged in 1.5-ml conical tubes at 20, 800 ×g for 10 min to remove the membrane ghosts, and the supernatant fractions were stored at −20 °C. A modified Lowry assay was used to determine protein concentrations in the extracts. Assays were done in duplicate with bovine serum albumin as a standard (18Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Methyltransferase activity was assayed by its ability to transfer the methyl group fromS-adenosyl-l-methionine to ovalbumin. The supernatant fraction from homogenized tissues (10–60 μg of brain, heart, or testis protein; 0.6–0.8 mg of erythrocyte protein) was incubated with 0.8 mg of ovalbumin (Sigma, Grade V) in 0.2m BisTris-HCl, pH 6.0, containing 10 μm[14C]AdoMet (53 mCi/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a final volume of 40 μl at 37 °C for 15 min. NaOH (80 μl of a 200 mm solution) was added to stop the reaction and to hydrolyze the [14C]methyl esters formed on ovalbumin to [14C]methanol. The reaction mixture was immediately spotted onto an 8 × 2-cm piece of thick filter paper and incubated above 5 ml of Safety-Solve scintillation fluid (Research Products International) in the neck of a sealed 20-ml scintillation vial at room temperature for 2 h to allow [14C]methanol to diffuse into the scintillation fluid. The filter paper was removed, and the scintillation fluid was counted for radioactivity. Incubations containingS-adenosyl-l-[methyl- 14C]methionine, ovalbumin, and buffer constituted the “blank” for the assay; the radioactivity in these tubes (typically <5% of the nonblank samples) was subtracted from total counts in the determination of enzyme activity. Cellular proteins were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with 0.8 μg of recombinant human l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (specific activity, 10,000 pmol of methyl esters formed on ovalbumin at 37 °C/min/mg protein) (24MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) in 0.2 m BisTris-HCl, pH 6.0, and 10 μm [14C]AdoMet in a final volume of 40 μl. After base hydrolysis, [14C]methanol production was measured as described above to quantitate l-isoaspartyl andd-aspartyl methyl-accepting sites in cellular proteins. Incubations containing [14C]AdoMet, recombinant methyltransferase, and buffer constituted the blank for the assay; the radioactivity in these tubes was subtracted from each sample's total counts. Each sample was assayed in duplicate or triplicate, and the average value is reported. Damaged residues that are already methylated within cells by the endogenous methyltransferase andS-adenosyl-l-methionine are not measured in the assay described above but can be quantified after mild base treatment. Protein (8.3–9.6 mg) from homogenized Pcmt1−/− andPcmt1+/+ brains was incubated in 20 μl of 75 mm potassium borate, pH 10.2. After times ranging from 5 s to 360 min, 10 μl of 500 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 5.7, was added to lower the pH to about 6. Then, recombinant human methyltransferase (5 pmol/min) andS-adenosyl-l-[methyl- 14C]methionine (10 μm final concentration) in 10 μl of 150 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 6.0, was added, and these reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 135 min. The reaction was stopped by freezing on dry ice, and then the base-labile methyl esters were quantitated as described above. Urine, freshly voided on Parafilm, was collected with a pipette and stored frozen until used. Creatinine in the urine was measured by a modified form of the procedure of Bosnes and Taussky (25Bonsnes R.W. Taussky H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1945; 109: 581-591Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). An aliquot of each urine sample (0.3–1 μl) or standard creatinine (0–25 μg) was diluted to 50 μl with water in duplicate tubes. Picric acid was added (25 μl of a 40 mm solution), and the tubes were capped and incubated in a boiling water bath for 45 min. After cooling to room temperature, 25 μl of 0.75 m NaOH was added. Within 15 min, 90 μl of each sample was transferred to a flat-welled microtiter plate (Costar), and absorbance was measured at 525 nm with a Beckman DU-600 plate reader. Damaged aspartyl residues in the urine were assayed with recombinant human methyltransferase as described above. Free amino acids and isoaspartyl-containing dipeptides in urine were derivatized witho-phthalaldehyde and 2-mercaptoethanol, separated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and quantitated by fluorescence as described previously (26Gary J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4076-4087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A precipitate that formed upon mixing of the urine and derivatization reagent was removed by centrifugation at 20,800 × g for 3 min prior to injection. Urine that had been dried in 6 × 50-mm glass tubes was hydrolyzed in vaporized hydrochloric acid in vacuo at 108 °C for 3 h with a PicoTag Work Station (Waters); amino acids in the hydrolysates were quantitated as described above. The fluorescence color constants for these derivatives were determined with amino acid and dipeptide standards. We generated two Pcmt1transgenic mouse lines, lines 27 and 29, in which the murinePcmt1 methyltransferase cDNA was placed under the control of a neuron-specific promoter. We then compared the survival of “transgenic Pcmt1−/− mice” with that of “nontransgenic Pcmt1−/− mice.” Whereas nontransgenicPcmt1−/− (n = 129) mice died at a median age of 44 days (with only one mouse living beyond 150 days), the transgenic Pcmt1−/− mice lived much longer (Fig.2). Of 11 line 27 transgenicPcmt1−/− mice examined in this study, 6 died between 30 and 90 days of age, but 4 lived from 549 to 757 days. Line 29 transgenic Pcmt1−/− mice (n = 19) died at a median age of 213 days (Fig. 2), and 3 lived more than 400 days. The nontransgenic Pcmt1−/− mice began to die at about 21 days. In contrast, none of the line 29 transgenic Pcmt1−/− mice died at less than 52 days of age (Fig. 2). Line 27 and most of the line 29 mice possessing one or two copies of the endogenous Pcmt1 gene were indistinguishable from comparable nontransgenic mice in size, weight, and behavior, although 15 of 94 line 29 mice ran rapidly in circles. Line 27 and line 29 mice appeared to have normal physiological functions and had unremarkable tissue histology. The transgenic Pcmt1−/− mice, however, differed from the nontransgenic Pcmt1−/− animals in several ways. First, although nontransgenic Pcmt1−/− mice weighed significantly less than age- and sex-matchedPcmt1+/− and Pcmt1+/+ littermates (18Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), the weights of transgenic Pcmt1−/− mice were identical to their Pcmt1+/− and Pcmt1+/+ littermates (data not shown). Second, due to their low grade seizure activity (e.g. facial grooming and myoclonic jerks), the nontransgenic Pcmt1−/− mice could often be distinguished by observation from wild-type and heterozygous littermates. In contrast, these abnormalities were not observed in the transgenicPcmt1−/− mice. 2Nonfatal running/jumping seizures have been observed in three transgenic Pcmt1+/− andPcmt1+/+ mice but never in nontransgenic animals.Finally, nontransgenic Pcmt1−/− mice of either sex never produced litters, even when housed with Pcmt1+/+ animals and given the anti-seizure drugs valproic acid and clonazepam, and only a single mating was observed (20Kim E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20671-20678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Two line 27 Pcmt1−/−animals, however, produced two small litters without the administration of any drug treatments, and 17 pairings involving male and/or female line 29 Pcmt1−/− mice have produced three litters (from two different Pcmt1−/− mothers). The Pcmt1 transgene controlled by a neuron-specific promoter appeared to rescue, at least partially, the early death phenotype seen in mice lacking the endogenous methyltransferase. We next investigated where in the mouse, and at what level, the transgene was being expressed by assaying methyltransferase activity in various mouse tissues. As expected, transgenic mice possessing one or two copies of the endogenousPcmt1 gene expressed the methyltransferase in all tissues assayed, including brain, heart, testes, erythrocytes, liver, and kidney, at levels similar to those observed in nontransgenic mice (Table I) (18Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In contrast, transgenicPcmt1−/− mice expressed methyltransferase activity in the brain but not in the other tissues (Table I), and Western blot analysis detected PCMT1 protein only in brain homogenates (data not shown), suggesting that the neuron-specific enolase promoter was properly directing expression to neurons. However, the activity of this transgene-derived methyltransferase in the brain was relatively low; line 27 Pcmt1−/− brains had only 6.5% and line 29Pcmt1−/− brains only 13% of the PCMT1 activity observed in wild-type brains. The amount of activity in brains from young (50 days) and older (370 days) transgenic Pcmt1−/− animals was not significantly different (data not shown). Since about half of the cells in the brain are not neurons (27Kandel E.R. Kandel E.R. Schwartz J.H. Jessell T.M. Principles Of Neural Science. 3rd Ed. Appleton & Lange, East Norwalk, CT1991: 22Google Scholar), some reduction of methyltransferase activity was expected in these brains. The low activity observed here, however, suggested that even in neurons the expression of the transgene was weaker than that of endogenousPcmt1 in wild-type neurons. Relatively low levels of neuronal expression from the neuron-specific enolase promoter have been reported by other investigators (28Forss-Petter S. Danielson P.E. Catsicas S. Battenberg E. Price J.

The value of standard deviation here represents differences between individual mice; the variation of the assay within a single tissue extract was generally very low (<5%). The finding that transgenic mice expressing methyltransferase solely in neurons lived longer than nontransgenic knockout mice led us to compare the accumulation of damaged aspartyl residues in the brains of these animals. Recombinant human methyltransferase was used to label these residues in cytosolic/microsomal proteins with [14C]methyl groups from [14C]AdoMetin vitro. Examining 39 transgenic and 13 nontransgenicPcmt1−/− mice, we found about 50% fewer damaged aspartyl residues when the transgene was present, indicating that the transgene-derived enzyme was repairing damaged neuronal proteins. However, the transgenic Pcmt1−/− brains still had about 4.5-fold more damaged residues than did Pcmt1+/− andPcmt1+/+ brains (Fig. 3). These damaged residues could be accumulating both in neurons, due to the relatively low methyltransferase activity, and in glia, which should not express the transgene at all. Examination of the levels of aspartyl damage in the brain with respect to age revealed several interesting points. First, these levels increased with age in young animals; 40-day-old and older mice had significantly more damaged residues per mg of protein than did the 13–21-day-old mice (p = 0.001 forPcmt1−/− mice; p = 10–8 forPcmt1+/− and Pcmt1+/+ mice; Fig. 3). Second, the 13–14-day-old Pcmt1−/− animals already possessed about 8-fold more damaged aspartyl residues per mg protein than did age-matched Pcmt1+/− and Pcmt1+/+ animals (Fig.3). The difference in the amount of damage remained 8–11-fold as these mice aged to 91 days, demonstrating that both nursing and weanedPcmt1−/− mice accumulate these residues. Finally, there was no significant increase in the level of damaged aspartyl residues in transgenic Pcmt1−/− mice after about 100 days of age (Fig. 3). In addition, although line 29 Pcmt1−/− mice averaged twice as much brain PCMT1 activity as did comparable line 27 mice, the plateau level of damaged aspartyl residues in these two lines was not significantly different. The quantity of damaged residues inPcmt1+/− and Pcmt1+/+ mice also attained an apparent steady state, although at a much lower level (Fig. 3). Because damaged residues were arising continuously in the cellular proteins, this stable level of damage probably represents a steady state between new damage, methyltransferase-linked repair, protein turnover, and perhaps unknown factors. In control experiments, we asked whether the low level of damaged residues measured in the assays of Pcmt1+/− andPcmt1+/+ mice resulted in part from the fact that some were already methylated by the endogenous enzyme. We therefore incubated brain cytosolic proteins under basic conditions wherel-isoaspartyl α-methyl esters should hydrolyze within a few minutes to generate l-isoaspartyl residues with about an 80% yield (30Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6164-6170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Patel K. Borchardt R.T. Pharm. Res. ( N. Y. ). 1990; 7: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Analysis of these samples with recombinant methyltransferase (data not shown) indicated that the true number ofl-isoaspartyl residues in the Pcmt1+/− andPcmt1+/+ proteins could be as much as 2.4-fold higher than the data shown in Fig. 3. 3When damaged aspartyl residues in brain proteins from Pcmt1−/− mice were quantitated as a function of time of base treatment, a linear increase of 1.8 pmol of damaged residues/mg of protein/min was obtained. This increase resulted from the creation of new damaged residues in the proteins. In contrast, quantitation of damaged residues in brain proteins from Pcmt1+/+ mice gave a biphasic increase with time of base treatment. For the first"

Berezney R. Jeon K.W. International Reviews of Cytology.in: Academic Press, Inc., New York1995: 1-65Google Scholar). Integration of these events is thought to occur within a high level of chromatin structure where the nuclear matrix organizes DNA into functional loops by binding specific sequences or “matrix attachment regions.” Not surprisingly, these regions are often found flanking actively transcribed genes and may serve as localization sites for assembly of factors regulating gene expression (5Gasser S.M. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 511-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6VanDriel R. Humbel B. DeJong L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 47: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Dworetzky S.I.

Structurally, the intact nuclear matrix includes nuclear lamina, residual nucleoli, and ribonucleoprotein particles bound via a fibrous network of proteins, RNA, and polysaccharides. Although lamins and heterogeneous nuclear RNA proteins are the predominant protein constituents, the core structure contains more than 100 distinct nuclear matrix proteins, many of which bind DNA (8Fey E.G.

To date, relatively few nuclear matrix proteins have been characterized in detail, and little is known about how they are incorporated into the matrix. Complicating the analysis is the fact that the nuclear matrix is a dynamic structure, and its protein composition is affected by environmental stimuli and growth conditions. Indeed, several nuclear matrix proteins have been identified as useful markers for specific types of cancer (11Hughes J.H. Cohen M.B. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1999; 111: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 12Replogle-Schwab R. Pienta K.J. Getzenberg R.H. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1996; 6: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Detailed ultrastructural analysis of purified matrices has confirmed that despite this variability, all nuclei contain a similar structural network that constitutes a core nuclear matrix (13Fey E.G. Krochmalnic G. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 14He D. Nickerson J.A. Penman S. J.

Although the structure of the nuclear matrix has been carefully observed, the mechanisms for its assembly and stabilization remain largely unknown. The fact that the core matrix remains after removal of nucleic acids indicates that protein-protein interactions play an important part in maintaining the structure. This principle has led us to propose that nuclear matrix proteins contain unique domains for association with binding partners within the nuclear matrix. These domains may provide sufficient specificity to direct proper assembly of the nuclear matrix, an event that occurs after each mitotic cycle. This hypothesis is consistent with the nuclear matrix serving as a scaffold upon which chromatin and other nuclear components are subsequently incorporated and ultimately organized. We have examined the binding domains within AKAP95,1 a zinc finger protein found in the nuclear matrix of a wide variety of mammalian cells (17Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Eide T. Coghlan V.M. Orstavik S. Holsve C. Solberg R. Skalhegg B.S. Lamb N.J.C. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Scott J.D. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition to binding DNA, AKAP95 contains a C-terminal amphipathic helix that serves as an anchoring domain for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Thus, AKAP95 may play a key role in linking the nuclear matrix to specific cell-signaling events. In this report, we define domains within AKAP95 that are critical for nuclear import and for interactions within the nuclear matrix. We identify several AKAP95 binding partners in purified nuclear matrix and characterize the specific interaction with p68 RNA helicase, a important component of transcriptional initiation complexes. Deletion mutants were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of rat AKAP95 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number UO1914) using nativePfu thermostable DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and synthetic oligonucleotide primers (Genosys). Primers were designed to amplify selected fragments of AKAP95-coding sequence with incorporation of suitable restriction sites for subcloning. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with restriction enzymes, gel-purified (Geneclean II; Bio 101), and cloned directly into either pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or pEGFP-N2 (CLONTECH), a mammalian expression vector incorporating a C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion. Deletion mutant vectors were designated based on the amino acids of AKAP95 that they encode. DNA modification and restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs or Promega. For site-directed mutagenesis, a polymerase chain reaction-based method (QuikChange, Stratagene) was used to introduce codon changes in AKAP95 cDNA that resulted in substitutions of acidic or neutral residues for selected basic amino acids. Basic regions of AKAP95 were designated alphabetically and correspond to A (amino acids 283–289), B (301), C (366), D (373), E (438), and F (444). Predicted amino acid sequences of the substitutions were A (RDWPRRR to QDWRSSR), B (RKRK to REQK), and CD (KKRREKQRRRDR to KESSEKQRSRDR). Proper subcloning and sequence integrity of all constructs was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (Thermosequenase, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mutated vectors were transiently transfected into cultured cells 24 h before fixation. Tissue culture cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C at 7% CO2. Cell lines used were: COS7 (SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney; ATCC CRL-1651), CHO-K1 (Chinese hamster ovary; ATCC, CCL-61), HEK293 (human embryonic kidney; ATCC CRL-1573), GH3 (rat pituitary tumor, ATCC; CCL-82.1), and Swiss 3T3 (Swiss albino mouse fibroblasts; ATCC, CCL-92). COS7, 293, and 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences), 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma). CHO-K1 cells were grown in F-12K medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. GH3cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 15% HS (JRH Biosciences) and 2.5% fetal bovine serum. For transfections, cells were split onto sterile, poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated coverslips in 6-well tissue culture dishes. When 60–80% confluent, the cells were incubated with lipid-DNA complexes in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM, Life Technologies) for 4–5 h, then grown in serum-containing growth medium for 18–24 h. COS7, CHO-K1, and 293 cell lines were transfected using Pfx-6 lipid and GH3 cells with Pfx-4 lipid as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). 3T3 cells were transfected using standard calcium phosphate reagents (Life Technologies). Isolation of the nuclear matrixin situ was carried out using a modification of the procedure described by Penman and co-workers (13Fey E.G. Krochmalnic G. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells grown on glass coverslips were washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and extracted with cytoskeletal buffer (CS; 300 mmsucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (2 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride). After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, coverslips were rinsed three times with CS buffer and incubated in digestion buffer (300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0) containing 200 units/ml DNase I and 1 unit/ml RNase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 1 h, the digestion buffer was brought to 0.25 m(NH4)2SO4 by dropwise addition from a 1 m stock, and the coverslips were incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. After two final CS buffer rinses, the extracted nuclear matrix was fixed in formalin for 10–15 min and placed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before immunochemical analysis. Nuclear matrix was prepared from rat brain as described (13Fey E.G. Krochmalnic G. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Nuclear matrix was prepared similarly from cultured cells, except CS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm EGTA was used to extract nuclei because this buffer was found to partially solubilize AKAP95. Briefly, nuclei from ∼1 × 107 cells were lysed in 1 ml of the supplemented CS buffer at 4 °C by passage through a 22-gauge needle (3×). After 5 min on ice, the lysate was passed again through the needle then centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (solubilized fraction) was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in digestion buffer. After incubation with DNase I (200 units/ml) and RNase A (1 unit/ml) for 30 min at 20 °C, the mixture was brought to 0.25m (NH4)2SO4, incubated for 5 min on ice, and centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (chromatin fraction) was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in CS buffer containing 2 m NaCl. After 5 min on ice, the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 × gfor 5 min. The supernatant (high salt extract) was removed, and the pellet (insoluble matrix) was resuspended in 10 mmTris-HCl, 0.2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5. For immunoprecipitations, solubilized extracts were obtained from COS7 cells 16 h after transfection with expression vectors for AKAP95 (AKAP95-pCDNA) or p68 RNA helicase (RH-pCMV/GST; ∼1 μg each) as described above. The extract was pre-incubated with protein A-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C and clarified by centrifugation (14,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C). AKAP95 was immunoprecipitated from the clarified extracts using affinity-purified rabbit antibodies and excess protein A-agarose as previously described (18Eide T. Coghlan V.M. Orstavik S. Holsve C. Solberg R. Skalhegg B.S. Lamb N.J.C. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Scott J.D. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%) and the presence of RH-GST fusion was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-GST (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and PAb204 anti-RH antibodies. For fluorescence detection of GFP, coverslips bearing transfected cells were rinsed with PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgSO4and fixed in a dark chamber for 15 min in formalin (4% formaldehyde, 1.5% methanol, 2% sodium acetate). For indirect immunofluorescence, cells were rinsed and fixed as above, then membrane-extracted with ice-cold 100% acetone (high performance liquid chromatography grade, Sigma) and blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Fisher). Coverslips were incubated in primary antibodies (rabbit anti-green fluorescent protein (Molecular Probes), mouse anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), rabbit anti-AKAP95 antibodies (17Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or mouse anti-p68 RNA helicase monoclonal antibody (PAb204, generously provided by Dr. H. Stahl, Universitat Konstanz, Federal Republic of Germany), each diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 2–4 h at 37 °C. After rinsing 3× with PBS, coverslips were incubated with secondary antibody (Texas Red- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:300 in PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were rinsed with PBS, incubated for 1 min in 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) to stain chromatin, rinsed briefly in distilled H2O, and wet-mounted onto slides using Fluoromount-G (Molecular Probes). Slides were viewed on a Nikon E600 epifluorescence microscope using 40× or 60× PlanFluor objectives, and images were acquired using a digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments). For in situ binding studies, recombinant AKAP95-(1–687), AKAP95-(1–386), AKAP95-(378–687), and purified bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs) were diluted to 0.5 mg/ml in 0.05 m bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5, and labeled with N-hydroxysuccinimide-fluorescein for 2 h on ice as described by the manufacturer (Pierce). After quenching the reactions with 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, labeled proteins were purified in the dark using a 2-ml desalting column (Excellulose; Pierce) equilibrated with TBS. All preparations had an F/P ratio (mol of fluorochrome/mol of protein) of 0.5–0.8. The labeled proteins (0.5 μg/ml in TBS) were layered over bovine serum albumin-blocked coverslips containing either formalin-fixed, acetone-extracted Swiss 3T3 cells or isolated nuclear matrix. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, the coverslips were washed extensively with TBS and processed for fluorescence observation as described above. Far Western blot assays were performed as described previously (19Coghlan V.M. Hames B.D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins: A Practical Approach.in: IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 293-311Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were produced in bacteria with N-terminal hexahistidine tags using the pET system (Novagen). For labeling, AKAP95 protein fragments were produced with a consensus PKA phosphorylation site and radiolabeled using [γ-32P]ATP and the catalytic subunit of PKA as described previously (19Coghlan V.M. Hames B.D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins: A Practical Approach.in: IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 293-311Google Scholar, 20Hausken Z.E. Dell'Acqua M.L. Coghlan V.M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29016-29022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The labeled proteins were used to probe polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) containing proteins transferred from 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After incubation at room temperature for 3 h, the radiolabeled AKAP95 probe was removed, and the membranes were washed three times with TBS before exposing to film for 16 h. Alternatively, a nonradioactive overlay was employed where recombinant proteins were labeled using activated digoxigenin and detected using peroxidase-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibodies with enhanced chemiluminescence as described previously (38Vo N.K. Gettemy J.M. Coghlan V.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cell extracts for analysis were prepared in TBS containing protease inhibitors (2 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride). Direct in vitrobinding assays using recombinant proteins immobilized on slot-blots were similarly performed and have been described previously (20Hausken Z.E. Dell'Acqua M.L. Coghlan V.M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29016-29022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All radiolabeled recombinant AKAP95 protein fragments were of similar specific activity (1–2 × 105 cpm/pmol), and incubations were performed using 105 cpm/ml probe in TBS containing 5% nonfat dried milk. A fragment of AKAP95 encoding amino acids 109–201 was amplified using polymerase chain reaction and cloned as a fusion with the Gal4 DNA binding domain in the yeast expression vector pAS-2. This construct was used as bait to screen a library (∼1.3 × 106 independent clones) of mouse embryo cDNAs, each fused to the Gal4 activation domain in the vector pACT2 (Matchmaker, CLONTECH). The yeast reporter strain AH109 (CLONTECH) was used as the host, and cells positive for growth on selective medium (−Ade/−His/−Leu/−Trp) were examined for β-galactosidase activity using a colony filter-lift assay (21Duttweiler H.M. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 340-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Positive interactions were confirmed by re-introducing cDNA (and sub-cloned derivatives) of retrieved clones into yeast Y190a and performing control crosses with yeast harboring the AKAP95-pAS2 construct or control vectors pAS, AKAP79-pAS, and RII-pAS as described previously (22Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). A heterologous expression system was used to investigate the subcellular localization of AKAP95. We initially examined the expression of rat AKAP95 cDNA in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) because this cell line has well defined morphology, and our antibodies do not cross-react with the endogenous AKAP95. As shown in Fig. 1, immunocytochemical staining indicated that the expressed AKAP95 protein (amino acids 1–687) localized exclusively to the nucleus (Fig. 1 A), where it co-localized with DNA (Fig. 1 B) but was excluded from nucleoli. The staining pattern is identical to that previously observed for the native protein in a variety of cell types (17Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Eide T. Coghlan V.M. Orstavik S. Holsve C. Solberg R. Skalhegg B.S. Lamb N.J.C. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Scott J.D. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), suggesting that the recombinant protein is imported into the nucleus and incorporated within the nuclear matrix. Similar results were obtained using cultured COS7 and CHO-K1 cells (not shown). Based on these results, we hypothesized that the AKAP95 polypeptide contains specific information (e.g. signal sequences) for both intracellular and intranuclear targeting. Initially, we used deletion mutagenesis to map regions of AKAP95 involved in intracellular targeting. Analysis of the AKAP95 sequence revealed six highly basic regions (sequentially designated A-F) that exhibit similarity to known nuclear import signal sequences (23Hicks G.R. Raikhel N.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 155-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Various fragments of AKAP95 cDNA containing selected basic regions were subcloned into mammalian vectors and expressed in COS7 cells as fusions with GFP. In transfected cells, an N-terminal fragment of AKAP95 (amino acids 1–386) containing the first four basic regions (A–D) was sufficient to direct the GFP reporter into the nucleus (Fig.2 a), where it co-localized with DNA (Fig. 2 b) and was absent from other cellular compartments (Fig. 2 c). Thus, the basic regions E and F, the zinc fingers, and the PKA binding domain of AKAP95 are not essential for nuclear import. To further define the nuclear import signals of AKAP95, site-specific mutations were introduced into the N-terminal fragment that resulted in substitutions of neutral or acidic amino acids for basic residues within basic regions A–D. Mutations introduced into the A, C, and D regions of AKAP95 had no effect on nuclear import of the AKAP-GFP fusion protein (Fig. 2, d and f). In contrast, mutations within the basic region B drastically impaired nuclear import of the fusion protein (Fig. 2 e) and resulted in a subcellular distribution similar to GFP (Fig. 2 g), where the fluorescent reporter was detected throughout the cell. The results indicate that basic region B (amino acids 301–305) is an important determinant for nuclear import of AKAP95. Deletion mutants were also used to define signals for intranuclear targeting of AKAP95. Because expressed AKAP95-(1–386) and full-length proteins exhibited identical localization patterns, we proposed that the nuclear matrix targeting site (NMTS) of AKAP95 was contained within the N terminus. Immunolocalization studies of purified nuclear matrix confirmed this hypothesis. Like the full-length protein (Fig.3 a), the AKAP95-(1–386)-GFP fusion protein (Fig. 3 b) remained associated with the nuclear matrix isolated in situ from transfected COS7 cells. In control experiments, GFP expressed by itself was not associated with the nuclear matrix (Fig. 3 c). Antibodies to GFP were used to specifically detect GFP and GFP fusion proteins because the harsh conditions used to extract the nuclear matrix were found to bleach GFP fluorescence. The results not only indicate that the AKAP95 NMTS is located within the N terminus, they also demonstrate that nuclear-matrix association is independent from DNA and PKA binding since the AKAP95-(1–386) fragment is missing the zinc finger domains and the PKA binding amphipathic helix (17Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further define the NMTS of AKAP95, a series of N-terminal deletions were constructed and fused to the GFP reporter. When transiently expressed in cultured cells, deletion mutants missing 50 or 110 N-terminal amino acids of AKAP95 localized and bound to the nuclear matrix (Fig. 3, d and e). In contrast, deletion mutants missing 140 or 170 amino acids from the N terminus failed to associate with the nuclear matrix (Fig. 3, f andg). These results indicate that amino acids in the region between positions 110 and 140 contain critical determinants for association of AKAP95 with the nuclear matrix. This region is highly conserved in rat, mouse, and human AKAP95 (Fig.4). Comparative analysis revealed similar sequences in the known nuclear matrix protein ZAN75 (24Lee J.Y. Kambe B. Hayashi M. Takenaga K. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and in the genetic neighbor of AKAP95, NAKAP95 (25Seki N. Ueki N. Yano K. Saito T. Masuho Y. Muramatsu M. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 45: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Sequence similarities, including a distinct pattern of aromatic residues, were found with AKAP95 from amino acids 127 to 152, and we propose that this region constitutes the NMTS of this protein family. The most likely role for the NMTS is to facilitate protein-protein interactions between AKAP95 and specific nuclear matrix components. Direct binding of AKAP95 N-terminal fragment to the nuclear matrix was confirmed using an in situ overlay where fibroblasts grown on glass coverslips were sequentially extracted and incubated with fluorescein-labeled recombinant AKAP95-(1–386) protein. In whole cells (Fig. 5 a) with intact, DNA-containing nuclei (Fig. 5 b), the labeled AKAP95 fragment bound to sites within the nucleus, with some staining of extranuclear structures (Fig. 5 c). More significantly, the labeled fragment bound the nuclear matrix after chromatin and other cellular structures were fully extracted from these cells (Fig. 5,d–f). Identical results were observed using the full-length protein (not shown). In contrast, a fluorescein-labeled AKAP95-(378–687) fragment missing the NMTS (Fig. 5, g–i) and a similarly labeled albumin control (not shown) did not bind isolated matrix. These results are consistent with NMTS-directed association of AKAP95 with specific nuclear matrix proteins and support our previous result that nuclear matrix incorporation is independent from nucleic acid binding. To identify potential binding partners within the nuclear matrix, we probed various tissue extracts with 32P-labeled recombinant AKAP95-(1–386) protein using a Far Western blot assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). No significant AKAP95 binding activity was observed in a survey of crude protein extracts from several rat tissues known to express AKAP95 including forebrain, cerebellum, and kidney (Fig. 6 A). However at least three protein bands corresponding to AKAP95-binding proteins (AKBPs) of 45, 52, and 69 kDa were detected in purified rat brain nuclear matrix using the radiolabeled AKAP95 probe (Fig.6 A). Identical results were obtained using recombinant AKAP95 labeled with digoxigenin (not shown), suggesting that the interactions are independent of AKAP95 phosphorylation. It is likely that the identified AKBPs represent distinct proteins since they were consistently observed in several preparations of nuclear matrix isolated in the presence of protease inhibitors. No binding proteins were detected using a truncated recombinant AKAP95-(170–386) probe (Fig. 6 b), supporting the hypothesis that AKBP association occurs via the identified NMTS. Traditional Western blot analysis of similar blots confirmed that AKAP95 was greatly enriched in the nuclear matrix preparation (Fig. 6 c), suggesting that AKBP-45, AKBP-52, and AKBP-69 are potential physiological binding partners for AKAP95. We employed the yeast two-hybrid method of interaction cloning to isolate cDNAs encoding AKBPs. Using an expressed Gal4 fusion of AKAP95 fragment (amino acids 109–201) containing the NMTS as bait, we recovered three positive clones from a mouse embryo library (1.3 × 106 independent clones total). Sequence analysis of the recovered cDNAs revealed that, although two clones encoded unique proteins, one clone encoded the C-terminal portion of p68 RH (amino acids 426–614). Control ex"

Science. 1994; 265: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). CIITA also activates other genes involved in antigen presentation such as the invariant chain and the HLA-DM genes (4Chin k.-C. Mao C. Skinner C. Riley J.L. Wright K.L. Moreno C.S. Stark G.R. Boss J.M. Ting J.P.-Y. Immunity. 1994; 2: 533-543Google Scholar, 5Chang C.-H. Flavell R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 765-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The significance of CIITA function in vivo was further confirmed by the generation of CIITA−/− mice that display a phenotype similar to patients with severe combined immunodeficiency disease, the bare lymphocyte syndrome (6Chang C.-H.

Benoist C. Mathis D. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 1957-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). CIITA also acts as a negative regulator for genes expressed in CD4 T cells including the interleukin-4 and FasL genes (8Gourley T. Roys S. Lukacs N.W. Kunkel S.L. Flavell R.A. Chang C.-H. Immunity. 1999; 10: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Sisk T. Gourley T. Roys S. Chang C.-H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2511-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10Gourley T.S. ourley C.-H. J. Immunol. in press, 2001Google Scholar). Therefore, CIITA has dual functions, acting as an activator or a repressor depending on the target promoter. Four different isoforms of human CIITA transcripts have been identified (11Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Otten L.A. Steimle V. Mach B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Each isoform is transcribed from a separate promoter that confers expression specificity. Thus, the first exon of each isoform is unique, but the rest of the exons are shared by all isoforms. Forms I and III are constitutively expressed primarily in dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells, respectively (11Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Otten L.A. Steimle V. Mach B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The interferon-γ-inducible form of CIITA (Form IV) is transcribed by the last promoter (11Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Otten L.A. Steimle V. Mach B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The second isoform is poorly characterized, and the specificity of its expression is unknown. The B cell form of CIITA (B-CIITA) has been extensively studied for transactivation function (12Harton J.A. Ting J.P.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6185-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), but the function of the form unique to dendritic cells (DC-CIITA) remains unknown. Studies using B-CIITA have demonstrated that CIITA contains four domains shared by all isoforms: the acidic domain, proline/serine/threonine-rich domain, the GTP binding domain, and the domain with leucine-rich repeats (1Steimle V. Otten L.A. Zufferey M. Mach B. Cell. 1993; 75: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Each domain serves a unique function, and all domains are required for proper transactivation of the MHC class II gene (12Harton J.A. Ting J.P.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6185-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 13Zhou H. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1995; 2: 545-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14Riley J.L.

Masternak K. Kammerbauer C. Janzen C. Reith W. Steimle V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7716-7725Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The caspase recruitment domain (CARD) was first identified as a peptide module present in the prodomains of upstream caspases and adapter molecules such as CED-4/Apaf-1 and RAIDD that mediates the recruitment of caspases via homophilic CARD-CARD interactions (18Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 257: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (450) Google Scholar). More recently, the CARDs have been found in other molecules including Nod1 and RICK that are components of NF-κB signaling pathways (19Inohara N. Kosekli T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The association of the CARD of Nod1 with the corresponding CARD of RICK induces the dimerization of RICK, which in turn activates NF-κB (19Inohara N. Kosekli T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Thus, the CARD functions as an effector domain that mediates specific homophilic interactions with downstream molecules to activate diverse signaling events. Nod1, a cytosolic protein with homology to plant disease-resistant R gene products and Apaf-1, shares a strikingly similar domain organization with CIITA (19Inohara N. Kosekli T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 D). Both Nod1 and CIITA have N-terminal effector domains, a centrally located nucleotide binding domain, and leucine-rich repeats at the C terminus. The effector domain of Nod1 is the CARD that is not present in the CIITA expressed in B cells. Here, we report that the first exon of DC-CIITA encodes a CARD. We found that DC-CIITA containing the CARD is a more potent transactivator for MHC class II expression than B-CIITA and that the CARD is required for enhanced transactivation activity. Unlike other CARD-containing proteins, however, DC-CIITA does not seem to interact with members of the caspase family or regulate apoptosis. These findings provide the first evidence for a novel regulatory role for the CARD in transcription. The unique feature of the DC form of CIITA may explain the enhanced expression level of MHC class II in DCs. To clone the first exon of the dendritic cell form of CIITA, PCR was performed using human genomic DNA and the primers 5′-EcoRI-FLAG-DC (5′-CTGGAATTCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGATAAAATGAACAACTTCCAGGCCATCCTG-3′) and the 3′ fourth exon (5′-GTCCTTGCTCAGGCCCTC-3′). To facilitate the cloning and detection by Western blot, an EcoRI site and a FLAG epitope tag were introduced within the 5′ primer. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and SacI, followed by ligation with a fragment encompassing the second through the last exon of full-length B-CIITA (1Steimle V. Otten L.A. Zufferey M. Mach B. Cell. 1993; 75: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The expression vector for CARD itself was produced by inserting the EcoRI and SacI fragment of the PCR product into the pCDNA3 expression vector. Full-length L27Q DC-CIITA and CARD(L27Q) were generated by overlapping PCR using two sets of primers: 5′-EcoRI-FLAG-DC and 3′-L27Q (5′-GTGCAGGCCCTCCAGGACAACCTGCTG-3′) and 5′-L27Q (5′-CAGCAGGTTGTCCTGGAGGGCCTGCAC-3′) and 3′ fourth exon. Secondary PCR was carried out using the primary PCR products as a template. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and SacI and cloned into the pCDNA3 expression vector to generate CARD(L27Q), and full-length L27Q was generated by replacing the corresponding fragment of wild-type DC-CIITA with this fragment. The integrity of the mutants was confirmed by sequencing. The MHC class II promoter-driven luciferase construct contains 2 kilobases of the Eα promoter (BglI-BalI) (Eα-luciferase), and the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven β-galactosidase and wild-type B cell isoform of CIITA were as described (8Gourley T.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 2511-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Full-length Nod1, the CARD of Nod1, and the NF-κB promoter-driven luciferase (NF-κB-luciferase) have been described (19Inohara N. Kosekli T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The human kidney cell line 293T was maintained in Click's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10−5m2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. RJ2.2.5 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing the same supplements as for the 293T cells. Human dendritic cells were prepared as described (20Chen B.-G. Shi Y. Smith J.D. Choi D. Geiger J. Mule J.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 4652-4661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transfection of 293T cells was performed using the calcium phosphate method. For the activation of the MHC class II promoter, 1 × 105cells were plated in 12-well plates. Each well of cells was transfected with 100 ng of the Eα-luciferase, 100 ng of the CIITA expression vector, and 100 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector. To assess the activation of the NF-κB promoter, 0.3 ng of NF-κB-luciferase was transfected with 33 ng of Nod1 or DC-CIITA expression vector in the presence of 33 ng of β-galactosidase (19Inohara N. Kosekli T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Two days post-transfection, cells were harvested, washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in Reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) followed by luciferase and β-galactosidase assays as described (9Sisk T. Gourley T. Roys S. Chang C.-H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2511-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). β-galactosidase readings were used to normalize the relative luciferase activity of each sample for all transfections. RJ2.2.5 cells were transiently transfected using 5 × 106 RJ2.2.5 cells, 10 μg of the Eα-luciferase, 5 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector, and 20 μg of the CIITA expression vector by electroporation. To generate stable transfectants of RJ2.2.5, cells were electroporated with 20 μg of B-CIITA or DC-CIITA and were then selected with 1 mg/ml G418. For the Western blots, 2 × 105 293T cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with the CIITA expression vector as indicated in the figure legends. Reverse transcription PCR was performed as described (8Gourley T. Roys S. Lukacs N.W. Kunkel S.L. Flavell R.A. Chang C.-H. Immunity. 1999; 10: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The CIITA-specific primers used were: the first exon of DC-CIITA, 5′-TGCTGAAGGAGGACCTCCTCT-3′; B-CIITA, 5′-TGATGAGGCTGTGTGCTTCTG-3′; the second common exon, 5′-GAAGGTGGCTACCTGGAGCTT-3′; and the fourth common exon, 5′-GTCCTTGCTCAGGCCCTC-3′. The β-actin-specific primers were as described (6Chang C.-H. Guerder S. Hong S.-C. van Ewijk W. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 167-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. Staining was performed in the same buffer. L243 antibody was used to examine MHC class II. Flow cytometry was performed using FACScan. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation (21Harton J.A. Cressman D.E. Chin K.C. Der C.J. Ting J.P. Science. 1999; 285: 1402-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and Western blots were performed as described without any modification (9Sisk T. Gourley T. Roys S. Chang C.-H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2511-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). An anti-CIITA antibody was used to detect endogenous CIITA (22Zhou H. Su H.S. Zhang X. Douhan III, J. Glimcher L.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4741-4749PubMed Google Scholar). CARD homology in DC-CIITA was predicted and confirmed by two independent methods: ISREC ProfileScan, maintained by the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, and PSI-BLAST, maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Because the difference among the three isoforms of CIITA lies in the N termini (11Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Otten L.A. Steimle V. Mach B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), we studied the first exon unique to CIITA that is expressed in DCs in detail. We first compared CIITA transcripts from Raji B lymphoblastoid cells with DCs prepared from human peripheral blood. To distinguish the different isoforms of CIITA transcripts, we used the 5′ primer specific for the first exon unique to DC- or B-CIITA transcripts (Fig.1 A). The 5′ primer recognizing the second exon was used to detect the common exon. The 3′ primer from the fourth exon was used for all reactions. Consistent with the previous report (11Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Otten L.A. Steimle V. Mach B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), transcripts containing the B cell-specific first exon were present in both B and DCs (Fig. 1 B). However, the DC-specific first exon was detected in dendritic cells, not in B cells. To further characterize the N-terminal 94-amino acid region that is unique to DC-CIITA, we searched the public databases to identify peptides with homology to this region. The search revealed that the peptide encoded by the first exon of DC-CIITA has significant homology to CARDs found in members of the caspase family, as well as those found in caspase activators and NF-κB signaling molecules such as Nod1 and RICK (Fig. 1 C). The predicted CARD of DC-CIITA has a total of six α helices (shaded boxes) that are a hallmark of CARDs (23Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Wu G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the residues most conserved among the CARDs of various molecules are also conserved in DC-CIITA. Of particular interest, the CARD of Nod1 has the highest homology with CIITA CARD (25% identity, 43% similarity; Fig. 1 D). Both DC-CIITA and Nod1 have the CARD at the N terminus, the nucleotide binding domain in the middle, and the leucine-rich repeat at the C terminus. Thus, DC-CIITA and Nod1 share similar domain organization. Nod1 promotes caspase-9-induced apoptosis and induces NF-κB activity (19Inohara N. Kosekli T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Because of the high homology between DC-CIITA and Nod1, we asked whether DC-CIITA acts as a regulator of apoptosis and/or NF-κB activation. To test this, we co-transfected 293T cells with the expression vector for DC-CIITA or Nod1 along with the NF-κB-luciferase reporter construct. The cytomegalovirus promoter-driven β-galactosidase was co-transfected to monitor transfection efficiency. As a control, we tested the activation of the MHC class II promoter. As expected, Nod1 activated the NF-κB but not the MHC class II promoter (Fig. 2). Conversely, DC-CIITA did not activate NF-κB but did activate the MHC class II promoter. In addition, the expression of DC-CIITA did not induce apoptosis when overexpressed in 293T cells. 2K. Nickerson, T. J. Sisk, N. Inohara, G. Núñez, and C.-H. Chang, unpublished data. DC-CIITA but not Nod1 also activated the MHC class II promoter in RJ2.2.5 B cells that have a defect in the endogenous CIITA gene (24Accolla R. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (see below).2These data suggest that the activities of DC-CIITA and Nod1 are distinct and that DC-CIITA does not participate in NF-κB activation. We then compared the transactivation activities of DC-CIITA and B-CIITA using the Eα-luciferase reporter. When DC-CIITA was co-transfected into 293T cells, the luciferase activity was greater than that from cells transfected with B-CIITA (Fig.3 A, left panel). DC-CIITA also showed a higher activity in RJ2.2.5 cells, indicating that DC-CIITA is a more potent activator than B-CIITA (Fig.3 A, right panel). We wanted to examine the transactivation ability of the two isoforms in more detail. To do this, an increasing amount of each CIITA expression vector was co-transfected with a constant amount of the Eα-luciferase reporter. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the induction of the MHC class II promoter by DC-CIITA was greater than by B-CIITA at any given concentration of DNA. However, this was not caused by more DC-CIITA protein being expressed in cells because DC-CIITA was expressed at a lower level than B-CIITA upon transfection (Fig. 3 C). We next tested whether the protein levels of DC-CIITA in the nucleus are greater than those of B-CIITA, which may result in higher transactivation. When nuclear fractions of the two forms of CIITA were compared, the level of DC-CIITA was much lower than B-CIITA (Fig.3 D). In addition, the relative distribution of DC-CIITA between the two compartments was comparable with that of B-CIITA. Because the above data were generated using transient assays, we tested whether DC-CIITA is also more potent in activating the endogenous MHC class II gene. We stably transfected DC-CIITA or B-CIITA to RJ2.2.5 cells and compared the levels of CIITA proteins and MHC class II on the cell surface. When the same amounts of cellular protein from two independent clones of B-CIITA- or DC-CIITA-transfected cells were analyzed, DC-CIITA proteins were barely detectable (Fig.4 A). Despite a lower level of DC-CIITA protein, the levels of MHC class II on the cell surface were comparable between DC-CIITA- and B-CIITA-expressing cells (Fig.4 B). We next examined the levels of endogenous CIITA proteins in primary DCs that express higher levels of surface MHC class II than B cells.2 To do this, we prepared total cell lysates from Raji and human DCs and compared endogenous CIITA proteins by immunoblotting with the anti-CIITA antibody. Consistent with the data from transfection studies (Fig. 3 C), the levels of DC-CIITA protein were lower than those of B-CIITA (Fig. 4 C). Taken together, the results indicate that the transactivation potential of DC-CIITA is greater than that of B-CIITA. We reasoned that the higher potential of DC-CIITA as a transactivator might be caused by the presence of the CARD. The conserved leucine residue at position 27 in the CARD of RAIDD is critical because mutation of this residue resulted in a loss of function (25Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 885-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the corresponding mutation of the CARD of Nod1 abolished its ability to interact with RICK or activate NF-κB (19Inohara N. Kosekli T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Therefore, we generated a mutant of DC-CIITA by substituting the conserved leucine with glutamine at position 27 (L27Q) to determine whether a functional CARD in DC-CIITA is required for enhanced transcriptional activity. We transfected the mutant and compared its transactivation potential to that of wild-type DC-CIITA and B-CIITA. As shown in Fig.5 A, the luciferase activity of the cells transfected with the L27Q mutant was equivalent to that of B-CIITA, suggesting that the additional activity of DC-CIITA is caused by the CARD. The level of L27Q protein was equivalent to that of the wild-type DC-CIITA (Fig. 5 A). The CARD is known to interact with other CARD-containing proteins through homophilic CARD-CARD association (18Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 257: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 23Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Wu G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 26Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6181) Google Scholar, 27Chinnaiyin A.M.

Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). If the CARD is responsible for a higher transactivation potential of DC-CIITA, then the CARD by itself might inhibit DC-CIITA function by interfering with the interaction of the CARD of CIITA with the CARD of a partner. To test this, we generated a construct expressing the wild-type CARD itself or the point mutant of the CARD with the L27Q amino acid substitution. We co-expressed wild-type or mutant CARD in 293T cells with DC-CIITA or B-CIITA in the presence of the Eα-luciferase reporter. The wild-type, but not CARD(L27Q), reduced the transactivation potential of DC-CIITA (Fig. 5 C, lanes 1-3). The inhibition was specific for DC-CIITA because wild-type CARD did not affect the ability of B-CIITA to transactivate the MHC class II promoter (Fig. 5 C, lanes 4-6). The CARD is a critical domain mediating protein-protein interactions and is known to be present in proteins in the cell death and the NF-κB activation pathway. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that the CARD participates in transcriptional regulation in the context of DC-CIITA. DC-CIITA is a unique transcription factor possessing a CARD. CIITA CARD did not interact with several CARD-containing proteins tested so far, including caspase-1, -2, -4, -9, c-IAP-1, RICK, Nod1, Nod2, ARC, Bcl-10, CARD-12, and ICEBERG.2 In addition, neither cell death2 nor NF-κB activation seemed to be affected by DC-CIITA (Fig. 2). Rather, the CARD in the context of CIITA confers a higher activity for CIITA as a transcription factor to activate the MHC class II genes but not the molecules involved in cell death. The mechanism by which the CARD serves as a transcriptional regulator of CIITA is not clear. We ruled out the possibility that the higher transactivation activity of DC-CIITA can be attributed to more efficient nuclear translocation and/or increased accumulation in the nucleus (Fig. 3 D). Because one amino acid substitution at a conserved residue known to be critical for CARD-CARD interaction abolishes the CARD activity, the CARD of CIITA may act by recruiting a protein. Interactions between CARDs have been shown to be selective (19Inohara N. Kosekli T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 23Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Wu G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). For example, the CARD of Apaf-1 interacts with caspase-9 CARD, whereas the CARD of Nod1 binds preferentially to RICK CARD (19Inohara N. Kosekli T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar,23Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Wu G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S.

Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that CIITA CARD recognizes a CARD of an unidentified protein(s), possibly a transcription factor(s), or a protein that cooperates with the DC-CIITA complex to enhance transactivation of the MHC class II gene. It would be of a great interest to identify the partner molecule for DC-CIITA. The conservation of the domain organization and the sequence homology between DC-CIITA and Nod1 suggest that these proteins may have originated from a common ancestral protein. Nod1 has been shown to confer responsiveness to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (30Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), indicating that Nod1 may have been evolved to become a sensor of pathogens. DC-CIITA, on the other hand, might be adapted as a transcription factor to induce MHC class II expression, which initiates the cascade of T cell-mediated immune responses resulting in elimination of pathogens. Thus, both DC-CIITA and Nod1 may have been evolved from an ancestral protein that might have been involved in host defenses against pathogens. DCs are considered the most efficient antigen-presenting cells. They take up pathogens and antigens efficiently, express high levels of MHC class II, migrate from the sites of antigen acquisition to secondary lymphoid organs, and stimulate T cells (31Thery C. Amigorena S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the presence of the CARD is at least partly responsible for the enhanced level of MHC class II expression in DCs. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that DC-CIITA performs other functions specific for DCs. The assessment of the role of CARD in vivo would clarify the role of DC-CIITA and provide an insight toward a better understanding of differences between CIITA isoforms. We thank Dr. Laurie Glimcher for providing the anti-CIITA antibody. We are also very grateful to Dr. Wes Dunnick for thoughtful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript."

In cell-free patches from these cells, physiological Ca2+ concentrations activated a single class of 1-picosiemens Cl−-selective channels. The same channels were also stimulated by a purified type II calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII), and in cell-attached patches by purinergic agonists. In whole-cell recordings, both Ca2+- and CaMKII-dependent mechanisms contributed to chloride channel stimulation by Ca2+, but the CaMKII-dependent pathway was selectively inhibited by inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(3,4,5,6)P4). This inhibitory effect of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 on ClCachannel stimulation by CaMKII was reduced by raising [Ca2+] and prevented by inhibition of protein phosphatase activity with 100 nm okadaic acid.

These calcium-activated Cl− (ClCa) channels are believed to have several important physiological functions, including regulation of membrane excitability (1Frings S. Reuter D. Kleene S.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 60: 247-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 3Kotlikoff M.I. Wang Y.-X. Am. J. Resp. Crit.

Pharmacological up-regulation of ClCa channels in secretory epithelia represents a potential therapeutic strategy for cystic fibrosis, in which there is defective expression of the cAMP-activated Cl− channels encoded by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (4Bennett W.D.

Thus, there is increasing interest in understanding the mechanisms through which Ins(3,4,5,6)P41specifically inhibits ClCa channels (see Ref. 5Ho M.W.Y. Carew M.A. Yang X. Shears S.B. Cockroft S. Frontiers in Molecular Biology: Biology of Phosphoinositides. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 298-319Google Scholar for a review). Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 is a cellular signal that accumulates following PLC activation (6Carew M.A. Yang X. Schultz C. Shears S.B. J. Biol.

When polarized epithelial monolayers were treated with a cell-permeant analogue of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, Ca2+-dependent Cl− secretion was inhibited (6Carew M.A. Yang X. Schultz C. Shears S.B. J. Biol.

Direct perfusion of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 into single cells has also been shown to inhibit ClCa channels in whole-cell patch clamp experiments (9Xie W. Kaetzel M.A. Bruzik K.S. Dedman J.R. Shears S.B.

As for the mechanism of action of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, experiments with recombinant bovine tracheal ClCa channels (bCLCA1), incorporated into lipid bilayers, indicate Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 to be a direct channel blocker (12Ismailov I.I. Fuller C.M. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Benos D.J. Barrett K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10505-10509Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The latter study also indicated that Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 inhibited activation of bCLCA1 by either Ca2+ or CaMKII (12Ismailov I.I. Fuller C.M. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Benos D.J. Barrett K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10505-10509Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). With regard to the nature of the human ClCachannels that are regulated by Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, these have not previously been characterized at either the gene or protein level. The current study focuses on ClCa channels in the CFPAC-1 human pancreatoma ductal cell line (13Schoumacher R.A. Ram J. Iannuzzi M.C. Bradbury N.A. Wallace R.W. Hon C.T. Schmid S.M. Gelder F.B. Rado T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4012-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Different species of ClCa channels can be distinguished by biophysical, pharmacological, and molecular criteria (1Frings S. Reuter D. Kleene S.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 60: 247-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The bCLCA1 channel mentioned above has a unitary conductance of 25–30 pS (14Cunningham S.A. Awayda M.S. Bubien J.K.

Fuller C.M. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Benos D.J. Barrett K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10505-10509Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Fuller C.M. Ismailov I.I.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is not known if Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 influences the conductance of these channels. In the current study using CFPAC-1 cells, we describe an alternate type of human ClCa channel that has a unitary conductance of 1 pS. This particular channel is activated by both Ca2+ and by CaMKII and is niflumic acid-sensitive. We further demonstrate that, in contrast to bCLCA1, only the CaMKII-dependent activation process is inhibited by Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 in CFPAC-1 cells; direct channel activation by Ca2+ is not inhibited by Ins(3,4,5,6)P4. These data provide a new context for understanding the physiological relevance of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 in the longer term regulation of Ca2+-dependent Cl− fluxes in human epithelial cells. Our new results also add substantially to our insight into the complexities inherent in the integration of various signaling inputs into overall Cl− channel regulation. CFPAC-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Cell Culture (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) in 5% CO2. Cells were harvested with 0.25% trypsin (Hyclone) and seeded on glass coverslips (Deutsche Spielglas, Carolina Biological, Burlington, NC) for patch clamp experiments. All experiments were performed on cells 1–2 days after seeding, with cell passages between 23 and 30. CaMKII was purified as follows. Crushed frozen rabbit brain (Pelfreez, Rogers, AK) was homogenized, the 100,000 × g supernatant was applied to calmodulin-Sepharose in the presence of calcium, and enzyme was eluted in buffer containing EGTA, as previously described (18Chan H.-S. Kaetzel M.A. Gotter A.L. Dedman J.R. Nelson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32464-32468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gotter A.L. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 118: 81-91Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Protein was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (NOVEX) transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with monoclonal antibodies against anti-CaMKII α or anti-CaMKII β (Life Technologies, Inc.), and visualized with 4-chloro-1-naphthol. It is the usual practice to add 10% (v/v) glycerol to stabilize the purified CaMKII (18Chan H.-S. Kaetzel M.A. Gotter A.L. Dedman J.R. Nelson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32464-32468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, these concentrations of glycerol, when they are introduced into the cell during electrophysiological analyses (see below), elicit considerable activation of swelling-induced Cl− currents (data not shown). Thus, glycerol was not added to our preparations of CaMKII, with the result that they progressively lost activity upon storage at 0–4 °C. Indeed, after 2 weeks of storage, CaMKII activity had declined below a usable level. Immediately prior to its use, CaMKII was made autonomous of Ca2+ as previously described (20Wagner J.A. Cozens A.L. Schulman H. Gruenert D.C. Stryer L. Gardner P. Nature. 1991; 349: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In some experiments, CaMKII was denatured by incubation at 95 °C for 15 min. All electrophysiological experiments were performed using an AxoPatch200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Voltage clamp protocols and data acquisition were controlled by pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments). Analog data were filtered at 1 kHz and then digitized at 10 kHz with a DIGIDATA 1321A digitizer (Axon Instruments). All experiments were performed at room temperature. Whole-cell Cl− currents across the plasma membrane were isolated pharmacologically by replacing monovalent cations with N-methyl-d-glucamine, which does not permeate even nonselective cation channels (21Bevan S. Gray P.T.A. Ritchie J.M. Proc. R. Soc. (Lond.). 1984; 222: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For conventional whole-cell recording through ruptured membrane patches, the bath solution contained 145 mm NMDG-Cl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 15 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The medium added to the pipette contained 40 mm NMDG-Cl, 105 mm NMDG-glutamate, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MgATP, 2 mm BAPTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and an appropriate concentration of CaCl2(estimated using MaxChelator software, Stanford University) to give a [Ca2+]free between 0.1 and 1 μm. The osmolarities of the bath and pipette solutions were measured with a Micro Osmometer (model 5004; Precision Systems Inc., Natick, MA), and then, by the addition of 10–20 mmmaltose to the pipette solution, its osmolarity was adjusted to about 5 mosm less than the bath solution; this prevents the activation of volume-activated Cl− currents. The pipette tip was prefilled, either with or without Ins(3,4,5,6)P4but always in the absence of any peptides, which improves seal frequency. When required, CaMKII autoinhibitory peptide (AIP) or CaMKII-(290–309) (both supplied by BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA), were added into the pipette solution at their final concentration. It was at this point that, in experiments that required autonomous CaMKII (see above), the latter was added to the pipette. In this case, recordings did not begin for an additional 2 min, in order to permit the CaMKII to diffuse toward the pipette tip. The membrane under the pipette was then ruptured in order to begin the experiment (seals >5 GΩ), and the pipette solution was dialyzed into the cell. Recordings were commenced 30 s after the membrane was ruptured to permit sufficient time for the pipette solution to equilibrate throughout the intracellular milieu. Where indicated, calphostin C, okadaic acid, or niflumic acid were added to the bath solution for at least 5 min before performing whole-cell recordings. The whole-cell Cl− currents were monitored with a protocol that began by voltage clamping the cell at −30 mV for 30 ms. Then the voltage was switched to −100 mV for 200 ms, stepped back to −30 mV for 30 ms, stepped to 100 mV for 200 ms, and finally stepped back to −30 mV. This sequence of voltage steps was repeated every 5 s for 5–10 min. I/V relationship of Ca2+- or CaMKII-activated whole-cell Cl− current was obtained with the following protocol. Membrane potential was held at −30 mV and then stepped to −110 mV for 50 ms to remove any voltage-dependent inactivation. Potentials were then stepped to a 300-ms test pulse ranging from −100 mV to +100 mV (in increments of 20 mV) before stepping back to −30 mV. All reported current was measured at 5 ms before the end of test pulse and normalized by cell capacitance. I/V curves from whole-cell recording were fitted with a second order polynomial equation. The value for current density was used to estimate channel density, based on the current recorded through single channels and the assumption that membrane capacitance was 1 microfarad/cm2. The pipette solution for cell-attached and excised inside-out patch clamp recording contained 145 mm NMDG-Cl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 nm charybdotoxin, and 10 mm Hepes pH 7.4. Seals in excess of 70 GΩ were first obtained in bath solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. For cell-attached single channel measurement, the bath solution was then switched to a solution containing 145 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes pH 7.4, in order to depolarize the cell to near 0 mV. For inside-out recording, patches were first excised into “base-line” bath solution containing 145 mm NMDG-Cl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.68 mmCaCl2, 2 mm BAPTA, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2 ([Ca2+] ∼ 0.1 μm). Where indicated, the [Ca2+] in the bath solution was then switched to 0.5 μm. When the effect of CaMKII was to be studied, the same base-line solution was used, except for the addition of 1 mm MgATP. The CaMKII that was used in these experiments was a truncated (1) type α isoform purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). This CaMKII was made autonomous according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ability of CaMKII to phosphorylate autocamtide II, a synthetic and specific substrate, was evaluated with a commercial kit purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Under these assay conditions (with [Ca2+] buffered to 0.25, 0.5, or 1 μm), Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 at 10 μm had no effect on CaMKII activity (data not shown). All channel activities were recorded continuously in Gap-Free mode for 30 s at various holding potentials. Data were filtered at 10 Hz and analyzed for the unitary current and open probability with the “Single” program (ASF Software, Nova Scotia, Canada). To improve the signal/noise ratio in all of the single channel recordings, pipettes were coated with three layers of sylgard before fire polishing to 10–15 megaohms. Results were presented as means ± S.E. of nobservations. Statistical significance was determined using unpaired Student's t test. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Calphostin C was purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories. Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 was purchased from CellSignals (Lexington, KY). Niflumic acid, UTP, and ATP were obtained from Sigma. Okadaic acid and 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-hydroquinone were purchased from Calbiochem. Finally, calmodulin was obtained from New England Biolabs. Diphenyl-amine-2-carboxylic acid was purchased from Fluka, andp-tetra-sulfonato-tetra-methoxy-calix[4]arene was a kind gift from Dr. R. Bridges (University of Pittsburgh) The unitary conductance is a biophysical fingerprint that can catalogue different members of a family of ion channels. All of the currently known ClCa channels have unitary conductances in the 1 - 30-pS range (1Frings S. Reuter D. Kleene S.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 60: 247-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Our first goal was to use this biophysical criterion to identify the nature of receptor-activated ClCachannels in CFPAC-1 cells. Single channel recordings were obtained from cell-attached patches on intact CFPAC-1 cells (Fig.1 A). To isolate Cl− channels, N-methyl-d-glucamine was substituted for all monovalent cations in the pipette solution, and K+ channels were blocked with charybdotoxin (see “Experimental Procedures”). Prior to receptor activation, there was little channel activity (NP o ∼ 0.08; Fig.1 B and t = 0 s tracein Fig. 1 C). When 100 μm UTP was added to the bath, we observed channels with a unitary current of approximately 0.1 pA (NP o ∼ 0.8; Fig. 1 B and t = 120 s trace in Fig. 1 C). These extremely small currents were distinguished easily from the background fluctuations in current amplitude by filtering the digitized records at 10 Hz. On average, the unitary current events had durations greater than 0.1 s, so discrete openings and closing could be resolved. Within 150 s following UTP addition, channel activity declined to the base-line level (NP o ∼ 0.05, Fig. 1,B and C). Similar transient channel activation was also observed after mobilizing intracellular Ca2+stores with 50 μm2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-hydroquinone (data not shown). The channels that were recorded after the addition of either UTP (Fig.1 D) or BHQ (data not shown) showed a linear I/V relationship with an estimated single channel conductance of ∼1 pS. No other channels were ever activated by UTP. In order to determine the gating mechanisms for the 1-pS ClCa channel in CFPAC-1 cells (Fig. 1), we analyzed patches that were excised from the cells in the inside-out configuration (cytoplasmic side of the membrane facing the bath; Fig.2 A). A total of 120 patches were obtained. These experiments were performed in the absence of ATP, so there could not be any channel phosphorylation. In all but ∼5% of patches, when [Ca2+] was buffered to 0.5 μm, it was possible to observe small conductance ClCa channels. However, in most experiments these channels could not be analyzed, because they were swamped by a 50-pS outwardly rectifying Cl− channel (ORCC; Fig. 2 D). The latter was generally activated in as little as a few seconds after excision of the patch, although occasionally the latency period was several minutes. Membrane depolarization reduced the lag time that preceded the onset of ORCC. This high conductance ORCC became active even when [Ca2+] was buffered to 0.1 μm(Fig. 2 D), and elevating [Ca2+] did not further stimulate ORCC. These results are in agreement with previous work showing that ORCC is not Ca2+-activated (22Schwiebert E.M. Egan M.E. Hwang T.-H. Fulmer S.B. Allen S.S. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Cell. 1985; 81: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Although the use of 50 nm p-tetra-sulfonato-tetra-methoxy-calix[4]arene (23Devor D.C. Singh A.K. Bridges R.J. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L785-L795PubMed Google Scholar) and 100 μm diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (24Singh A.K. Afink G.B. Venglarik C.J. Wang R. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C51-C63Crossref Google Scholar) are reported to inhibit ORCC in some cell preparations, these drugs did not prevent the appearance of ORCC in our experiments (data not shown). Nevertheless, in 40 of 120 single-cell patches, prior to the onset of ORCC and with [Ca2+] buffered to 0.1 μm (Fig. 2B), single channel openings were initially infrequent (NP o < 0.1) at all voltages. Elevation of Ca2+ from 0.1 to 0.5 μm activated ClCa channels with unitary currents of ∼0.1 pA at +70 mV (Fig. 2 B). In 10 patches, the onset of ORCC was sufficiently delayed to enable us to determine that the ClCa channels had a conductance of ∼1 pS (Fig. 2 E). No alternative ClCa channels with a different unitary conductance were ever activated by raising [Ca2+]. The value ofP o/N was higher at more depolarizing voltages (in a representative experiment with the same patch,P o/N = 0.47 at +90 mV;P o/N = 0.08 at −110 mV). A similar phenomenon has previously been observed with a 13–16-pS ClCa channel in HT-29 cells (26Morris A.P. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C968-C976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+-activated channel was also unaffected when endogenous calmodulin was antagonized by a synthetic peptide (25Payne M.E. Fong Y.-L. Ono T. Colbran R.J. Kemp B.E. Soderling T.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7190-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) corresponding to residues 290–309 of CaMKII (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that 0.5 μm [Ca2+] directly activated these 1-pS Cl− channels. In some experiments, instead of elevating [Ca2+], a partially purified and constitutively active CaMKII was added with ATP to excised inside-out patches. Provided the onset of ORCC was sufficiently delayed (see above), a CaMKII-activated Cl−current was then observed (unitary current ∼0.1 pA at +70 mV; Fig.2 C). The value of P o/N was higher at more depolarizing voltages (in a representative experiment with the same patch, P o/N = 0.62 at +100 mV; P o/N = 0.33 at +50 mV). The addition of ATP alone had no effect on channel activity (Fig.2 C). The current/voltage relationship for this channel yielded a unitary conductance of 1 pS (Fig. 2 E). We never observed any alternative CaMKII-activated ClCa channels with a different unitary conductance. The experiments described above establish the existence of a single class of 1-pS ClCachannels in CFPAC-1 that are activated by both Ca2+ and CaMKII. We next investigated to what extent either of these two regulatory processes contribute to the control of whole cell Cl− current. BAPTA was employed to buffer intracellular [Ca2+]. The Cl− currents elicited by voltage steps of 300-ms duration from the holding potential of −30 mV (E Cl) were measured under voltage clamp through conventional ruptured membrane patches and normalized to cell capacitance (Fig. 3 A). When the interior of the cell was perfused with pipette solution containing 0.1 μm [Ca2+], voltage steps to either +100 or −100 mV did not elicit any current larger than ∼ 4 pA/picofarads (Fig. 3 B). Thus, at resting levels of intracellular [Ca2+], there is very little voltage-dependent or background Cl− current in these cells, which corresponds to the low single channel activity of 1-pS ClCa channels under resting conditions (Fig. 2). When intracellular [Ca2+] was elevated from 0.1 to 0.5 μm, the whole-cell Cl− current was elevated to a much larger steady-state value of 146 ± 8 pA/picofarads at 100 mV (n = 12), within 2–3 min of rupturing the membrane under the patch pipette (Fig. 3 B). The channel density was estimated to be ∼14 channels/μm2 at 100 mV (see “Experimental Procedures”). The responses were highly reproducible; the time course that is shown (Fig. 3 B) represents the average of all 12 cells recorded with intracellular [Ca2+] buffered to 0.5 μm. Under steady-state conditions (indicated by the arrowhead in Fig.3 B), a series of voltage steps was applied, each of 300-ms duration (Fig. 3 C); the resultant current traces showed almost no time dependence and displayed weak outward rectification (Fig. 3 D). The current was completely blocked by the Cl− channel blocker, niflumic acid (IC50 = 3.5 μm; Fig. 3, E and F). The current reversed at −30 mV (Fig. 3 G), close to the Cl−equilibrium potential (E Cl) of −32 mV. The above experiments indicate that a sustained ClCa-mediated current can be maintained by an elevated level of intracellular [Ca2+]. Next, we addressed the individual contributions to this macroscopic current of direct channel activation by Ca2+, as compared with channel activation by CaMKII. To determine the participation of endogenous CaMKII, we used AIP to selectively inhibit CaMKII. The data from these experiments (Fig. 4) compare steady-state outward whole-cell current amplitudes measured at +40 mV and inward whole-cell current at −100 mV. These two voltages are equidistant from theE Cl at −30 mV, and the two resultant currents, while opposite in polarity, are nevertheless elicited by electrical driving forces that are equal in magnitude. Thus, the rectification of the current can also be estimated from these experiments (Fig. 4). Under symmetrical electrochemical driving force, 0.5 μm[Ca2+] activated a whole-cell current (Fig. 4,Control) with slight outward rectification. The inhibition of CaMKII by 5 μm AIP elicited a 57% reduction of the outward whole-cell current at +40 mV and 84% inhibition of the inward current at −100 mV (Fig. 4). Thus, at 0.5 μmintracellular [Ca2+], 60–80% of the macroscopic current was due to channel activation by CaMKII, with the remainder due to direct channel activation by Ca2+ itself. We also studied the effects of a synthetic peptide, corresponding to residues 290–309 of CaMKII. As well as this peptide directly preventing calmodulin from activating CaMKII, it binds and antagonizes other cellular actions of endogenous calmodulin (25Payne M.E. Fong Y.-L. Ono T. Colbran R.J. Kemp B.E. Soderling T.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7190-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the degree of inhibition of Cl− current by CaMKII-(290–309) was no different from that elicited by AIP (Fig. 4). Moreover, the effects of CaMKII-(290–309) and AIP were not additive (Fig. 4). The latter result verifies that both inhibitors were employed at maximally effective concentrations. Data in Fig. 4 also show that the role of calmodulin in regulating channel activity is solely due to its stimulation of CaMKII. A selective inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), calphostin C, was a useful control that had no significant effect upon whole-cell Cl− current (Fig. 4). Previous work has shown that whole-cell receptor-activated Cl− current in CFPAC-1 cells is inhibited by Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (11Ho M.W.Y. Shears S.B. Bruzik K.S. Duszyk M. French A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1160-C1168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We next studied how this action of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 related to the separate abilities of Ca2+ and CaMKII to activate ClCa channels. We examined the effects of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4upon outward Cl− current measured at +40 mV and inward Cl− current measured at −100 mV (Fig. 5, TableI). Three interesting new findings were made. (i) While increases in [Ca2+] activated whole-cell current, its inhibition by AIP, as a percentage of total current, was not substantially affected by changes in [Ca2+] (Fig. 5, Table I). This result indicates that endogenous CaMKII makes a substantial contribution to whole-cell current at all tested concentrations of Ca2+. (ii) The whole-cell current that was observed in the presence of AIP was not significantly different from the current obtained with AIP and Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 added together (Fig. 5, Table I). In other words, the AIP-insensitive current (i.e. the proportion of the current that was activated by Ca2+ directly) was not inhibited by Ins(3,4,5,6)P4. These data are consistent with the inability of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 to block Ca2+-activated ClCa channels during single-channel analysis of excised patches from CFPAC-1 cells (data not shown). This was an unexpected observation, because Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 blocks direct activation of bCLCA1 by Ca2+ (12Ismailov I.I. Fuller C.M. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Benos D.J. Barrett K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10505-10509Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, the data in Fig. 5 and Table I indicate that Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 must be specifically targeting the process by which CaMKII activates ClCa channels. (iii) We identified an unexpected interaction between Ca2+ and Ins(3,4,5,6)P4. For example, at 0.25 μm[Ca2+], Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 reduced whole-cell current by 60–70%, but at 1 μm [Ca2+], only 17% of whole-cell current was inhibited by Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (Fig. 5, Table I). Despite this, in the absence of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, the proportion of whole-cell current that was activated by CaMKII was similar at both concentrations of Ca2+ (see point (i)). Thus, we conclude that increases in [Ca2+] attenuate the degree to which Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 inhibited the macroscopic CaMKII-activated current.Table ICurrent inhibition[Ca2+]Inhibition of outward current at"
https://openalex.org/W2005682423,"Previously, by a yeast 2-hybrid screen, we identified signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (Stat5b) as a substrate of the insulin receptor (IR). We demonstrated that refeeding of fasted mice leads to rapid activation of Stat5 proteins in liver, skeletal muscle, and fat, suggesting that Stat5b is a physiological target of insulin. Here, we show that injection of glucose or insulin into fasted mice leads to robust activation of both Stat5a and Stat5b in skeletal muscle. In C2C12 myotubes, we find that insulin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5a and Stat5b by 3–5-fold. This degree of Stat5 activation in vitro is significantly lower than what we observe in vivo and inversely correlates with IRS-1/2 levels. We can recapitulate robust insulin activation of Stat5 in C2C12 cells by stable overexpression of the human IR (hIR). To identify insulin-activated genes that are Stat5 targets, we also overexpressed an IR mutant (LA-hIR) that signals normally for mitogen-activated protein kinase- and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathways but is deficient in Stat5 signaling in response to insulin. We demonstrate that insulin induces the expression of SOCS-2 mRNA in the wild type hIR but not in the LA-hIR-overexpressing cells. The induction of SOCS-3 by insulin is reduced but not lost in the LA-hIR cells. Therefore, our results suggest that insulin induction of SOCS-2, and in part SOCS-3 mRNA expression, is mediated by Stat5 and can be independent of mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-signaling pathways.

Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These effects are mediated by the binding of insulin and subsequent activation of the insulin receptor (IR)1 tyrosine kinase (1Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activated receptor phosphorylates itself as well as several other intracellular substrates. Unlike several members of the receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily, which directly recruit and phosphorylate signaling/adapter proteins, the IR mainly signals by recruiting and phosphorylating members of the insulin receptor substrate family, IRS-1, -2, -3, and -4, Gab1 and -2, and p62dok-1, -2, and -3 (2White M.

These proteins then serve as multivalent docking sites for the recruitment of other Src homology domain 2-containing signaling proteins. Subsequently, at least two major signal transduction cascades are initiated including the mitogen-activated protein kinase- and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase-signaling pathways, which propagate the signal to various cytoplasmic and nuclear effectors (1Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Unlike the IR, cytokine receptors do not possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Instead, they depend upon receptor-associated Janus kinase tyrosine kinases to initiate signaling after ligand binding (5Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter-Su C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 6Moutoussamy S. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Eur. J.

These Janus kinases become activated and phosphorylate themselves, the cytokine receptor to which they are bound, and Src homology domain 2-containing signaling/adapter proteins, including Stat transcription factors (6Moutoussamy S. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7Heim M.H. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 75-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This family of transcription factors includes Stats1, -2, -3, -4, -5a, -5b, and -6, where Stat5a and Stat5b are two separate but homologous gene products (95% amino acid identity) (8Mui A.L.-F. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.-M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Stat transcription factor proteins are found latent in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of the activating tyrosine residue in the Stat proteins results in the nuclear translocation of Stat dimers and confers the ability of the Stat dimers to specifically bind to promoter sequences of target genes and to transactivate those genes (9Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). Like receptor tyrosine kinases, cytokine receptors also activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase- and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase-signaling pathways and in some instances through Janus kinase phosphorylation of IRS family members (2White M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 119-138PubMed Google Scholar, 6Moutoussamy S. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Activation of Stats is not limited to cytokine receptors, as several receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, have been shown to activate one or more Stat family members through Janus kinase-independent and Janus kinase-dependent pathways (10David M.

Recently, by yeast two hybrid screen analysis using the kinase active cytoplasmic domain of the IR as a probe, we (13Chen J. Sadowski H.B. Kohanski R.A. Wang L.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and others (14Sawka-Verhelle D. Filloux C. Tartare-Deckert S. Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) identified Stat5b as a direct substrate of the IR. We then provided the first evidence that insulin can stimulate the activation of Stats bothin vitro and in vivo (13Chen J. Sadowski H.B. Kohanski R.A. Wang L.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that Stats (1, 3, 5a, and 5b) can be rapidly activated by insulin in two different IR-overexpressing cell lines and that perfusion of mouse livers with insulin selectively activates Stat5 proteins. Furthermore, we observed that refeeding of fasting mice, which causes post-prandial secretion of insulin, leads to the rapid activation of Stat5 proteins in liver, skeletal muscle, and fat, all physiologic target tissues of insulin action. Van Obberghen and co-workers (14Sawka-Verhelle D. Filloux C. Tartare-Deckert S. Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) also find that insulin could stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5b when co-expressed with the human IR in 293 cells. The potential importance of this pathway in insulin signaling is further supported by recent studies suggesting that Stat5b can play a role in the activation of glucokinase and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) gene transcription by insulin (15Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. Decaux J.-F. Girard J. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1977-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In addition to being activated after refeeding, Stat5b has been shown to be activated by insulin in pmi28 mouse muscle cells and Kym-1 rhabdomyosarcoma cells (17Storz P. Doppler H. Wernig A. Pfizenmaier K. Muller G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Storz P. Doppler H. Pfizenmaier K. Muller G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The ability to detect insulin-stimulated Stat5b activation in both skeletal muscle in vivo and in vitro suggested that Stat5 might play an important role in insulin-regulated gene expression in muscle. Here, we show that injection of glucose or insulin into mice leads to robust activation of both 5a and 5b in skeletal muscle. To develop a model system to study the role of Stat5 in insulin signaling in skeletal muscle cells, we examined the activation of Stat5a and Stat5b by insulin in the myogenic C2C12 cell line. We demonstrate that insulin treatment results in a rapid 3–5-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of both Stat5a and Stat5b in C2C12 myotubes but not in undifferentiated myoblasts. Interestingly, Sawka-Verhelle et al. (14Sawka-Verhelle D. Filloux C. Tartare-Deckert S. Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) mapped the site of interaction of Stat5 with the human IR to Y972 located in the juxtamembrane region of the IR by yeast two-hybrid analysis. This site contains a motif, 972pYLSA (pY is phosphotyrosine), that is similar to other Stat5 recruitment sites in cytokine receptors (19Nicholson S.E. Starr R. Novak U. Hilton D.J. Layton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 947-953Google Scholar, 20Klingmuller U. Bergelson S. Hsiao J.G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Overlapping this site is an NPEpY (972) motif that recruits IRS-1 and Shc (22Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trub T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In addition, by yeast 2-hybrid analysis, SOCS-3 competes with Stat5 for binding to this site as a part of the negative regulation of IR signaling via Stat5 (16Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Because IR levels are equivalent in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes, we speculate that the ability to detect Stat5 activation only in the myotubes is a consequence of reduced levels of IRS-1 and IRS-2 expression and increased levels of Stat5 expression compared with the myoblasts. In support of this hypothesis, the expression levels of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in isolated skeletal muscle are dramatically less than those observed in C2C12 cells. In contrast, IR expression is essentially equivalent in skeletal muscle and C2C12 cells. In lieu of significantly reducing the IRS-1 and IRS-2 content in C2C12 cells, we stably overexpressed the human IR (hIR) in C2C12 cells and obtained cell lines with an IRS:IR ratio that more closely approximates the ratio that exists in skeletal muscle. These cells respond to insulin with potent activation of Stat5 proteins and induction of putative Stat target genes such as CIS, SOCS1, SOCS2, and SOCS3 (23Naka T. Fujimoto M. Kishimoto T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Yasukawa H. Sasaki A. Yoshimura A. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 143-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). To identify insulin-activated genes that are specific Stat5 targets, we took advantage of an IR mutant (LA-hIR) that signals normally for mitogen-activated protein kinase- and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase-dependent pathways but is deficient in Stat5 signaling in response to insulin. 2M. Le, R. A. Kohanski, L.-H. Wang, and H. B. Sadowski, submitted for publication. We established cell lines expressing equivalent levels of either WT-hIR or LA-hIR, and we have demonstrated that insulin induces the expression of SOCS-2 mRNA in the WT-hIR but not in the LA-hIR-overexpressing cells. Interestingly, the induction of SOCS-3 by insulin is lost in LA-hIR myotubes but is only reduced in LA-hIR myoblasts. Therefore, our results suggest that in hIR cells Stat5 mediates the insulin induction of SOCS-2 and, in part, SOCS-3 mRNA expression. 6-week-old male C57/Black mice were fasted for 48 h before a bolus intraperitoneal injection of either glucose, insulin, or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline). 10 min (glucose) or 25 min (insulin) after the injection, the mice were euthanized, and tissues were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue lysates were prepared as described previously (13Chen J. Sadowski H.B. Kohanski R.A. Wang L.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).

Monoclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody, polyclonal antibody recognizing phospho-Akt (Ser473), and polyclonal antibody recognizing phospho-Stat3 (Tyr-705) were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Mouse skeletal muscle C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in growth medium: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.5% chick embryo extract, 25 mm HEPES, and 0.2% gentamicin. For myoblast cultures, C2C12 cells were grown to 80% of confluence on tissue culture dishes, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and placed in placed in serum starvation media: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 25 mm HEPES for 16 h before treatment with insulin or diluent (PBS). For the generation of myotubes, C2C12 cells were grown to confluence on tissue culture dishes coated with Matrigel, washed with PBS, and placed in differentiation medium (DM): Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% heat-inactivated horse serum and 25 mm HEPES for 3 days. Well differentiated cultures (>60% of the plate multinucleated myotubes) were then washed with PBS and placed in serum starvation media for 16 h before treatment with insulin or diluent (PBS). For generation of the WT-hIR and LA-hIR cell lines, C2C12 cells were plated at 1.5 × 105cells/35-mm tissue culture dish. After 16 h, the cells were transfected with 2.0 μg of pEF/hIR/Neo or pEF/LA-hIR/Neo. Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and plated at low density. Cells were selected for 14 days in neomycin (G418) before screening isolated colonies by analysis of lysates for the expression of hIR. For transient transfections, WT-IR cells were plated at 3 × 105 cells/60-mm tissue culture dish. After 16 h, the cells were washed and transfected with 3.0 μg of LHRR luciferase reporter plasmid, 1.5 μg of CMV-βgal, and either 1.5 μg of pRK5 empty vector or 0.75 μg of pRK5Stat5aFLAG and pRK5Stat5bFLAG with 18 μl of Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer directions. Twenty-four h after transfection, the transfected cells were split onto Matrigel-coated 6-well plates. Six h later, the cells were placed in serum starvation media for 16 h before treatment with dexamethasone and/or insulin or diluent (PBS). After stimulation with insulin for 6 h, cells were harvested in 1× reporter lysis buffer from Promega. After normalization for β-galactosidase activity, lysates were assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay kit from Promega. Tissue or cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (200 mmNaCl, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 nm microcystin) for 20 min at 4 °C. Lysates were cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation. Cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with either anti-Stat5A or anti-Stat5B antibodies, incubated with protein-A-Sepharose, washed four times in radioimmune precipitation buffer, boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 100 mmdithiothreitol, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide). Alternatively for Western blotting of whole cell lysates, cleared radioimmune precipitation buffer lysates containing equal protein were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide). After electrophoretic transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose, the membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in either bovine serum albumin blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) for anti-phosphotyrosine Western blots or milk blocking buffer (4% nonfat dried milk in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) for all other Western blots. Blocked membranes were incubated with primary antibodies in the appropriate blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed extensively, incubated with anti-mouse IgG2b-horseradish peroxide or anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxide in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 4% nonfat dried milk for 1 h, washed extensively, developed with Supersignal ECL reagent from Pierce, and exposed to film (Kodak X-Omat AR). Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (26Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis was performed on the whole cell extracts as described previously (26Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) with 32P-radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing high affinity binding sites for Stat5 (β-casein gene promoter (8Mui A.L.-F. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.-M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar)). After treatment with insulin, C2C12 or hIR64 cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies). Total RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis on agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to Hybond XL membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the Northern Max kit (Ambion), and fixed by UV cross-linking. Membranes were hybridized at 68 °C overnight (except for SOCS-1 at 75 °C) with 32P-radiolabeled antisense riboprobe derived from full-length cDNA inserts encoding CIS, SOCS-1, SOCS-2, or SOCS-3 (27Starr R. Wilson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J.L. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J.

Membranes were washed at high stringency (0.1× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at 68 °C) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR-5 film with an intensifying screen at −70 °C. For reprobing, membranes were stripped according to manufacturer directions for the Strip-EZ RNA kit (Ambion). We have shown that refeeding of fasting mice leads to increases in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5b in liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle (13Chen J. Sadowski H.B. Kohanski R.A. Wang L.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although these data suggest that physiological levels of insulin released after feeding are capable of stimulating Stat5 activation, we considered the possibility that peptides secreted by the gut after feeding might be responsible for stimulating the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 proteins. We therefore bypassed the feeding response and increased circulating insulin levels by direct injection of glucose into fasted mice. We detect strong increases in the tyrosine phosphorylation of both Stat5a and Stat5b in skeletal muscle within 15 min of glucose injection (Fig.1). As expected, direct injection of insulin into fasted mice also leads to rapid increases in the tyrosine phosphorylation of both Stat5a and Stat5b in skeletal muscle (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained in fat and liver. 4T. T. Wheeler and H. B. Sadowski, unpublished observations. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5b in response to insulin is detectable in several in vitro cell models including Kym-1 rhabdomyosarcoma (18Storz P. Doppler H. Pfizenmaier K. Muller G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and pmi28 mouse muscle cells (17Storz P. Doppler H. Wernig A. Pfizenmaier K. Muller G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as well as in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (16Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and HepG2 cells (15Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. Decaux J.-F. Girard J. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1977-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) when these cells are pretreated with protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. Stat5b, but not Stat5a, is activated in Kym-1 rhabdomyosarcoma cells (18Storz P. Doppler H. Pfizenmaier K. Muller G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which is in contrast to the in vivo activation of both Stat5a and Stat5b in the skeletal muscle that we observe. To determine whether insulin activates both Stat5 proteins in skeletal muscle cellsin vitro, we performed experiments with the myogenic C2C12 cell line. These cells are maintained in culture as myoblasts in the presence of high concentrations of serum. When C2C12 cells are grown to confluence and high serum-containing medium was removed, the myoblasts withdraw from the cell cycle and begin a myogenic program of differentiation. After 3 days in low serum, the myoblasts have already fused to form multinucleated myotubes that express muscle-specific genes at high levels. To determine whether insulin stimulates Stat5a or Stat5b either as proliferating myoblasts or at any point during the differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes, we treated C2C12 myoblasts or C2C12 cultures at 1, 2, 3, or 4 days in low serum media with or without insulin. We analyzed the control and insulin-stimulated lysates by immunoprecipitation with antibodies recognizing either Stat5a or Stat5b followed by blotting with a phosphorylation state-specific monoclonal antibody that recognizes both Stat5a and Stat5b phosphorylated on the activating tyrosine. We observed reproducible insulin-induced 3–5-fold increases in the tyrosine phosphorylation of both Stat5a and Stat5b in C2C12 myotubes with little or no effect detected in the undifferentiated myoblasts (Fig. 2). Indeed, the ability of insulin to activate Stat5 appears to be correlated with the level of differentiation in the C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 2 A). To determine whether the activation of Stat5 in skeletal muscle occurs at doses of insulin that do not result in activation of the IGF-1 receptor, we treated C2C12 myotubes with varying concentrations of insulin for 10 min. We detected insulin activation of Stat5a and Stat5b in C2C12 myotubes at doses of insulin below levels that activate the IGF-1 receptor (Fig. 2 B). To confirm this result, we treated C2C12 myotubes with 200 ng/ml recombinant insulin growth factor-1 for 10 min. Analysis of recombinant IGF-1-stimulated lysates with anti-phospho-Stat5 antibodies showed no detectable increases in Stat5 phosphorylation in response to IGF-1 (data not shown). To determine the kinetics of Stat5 activation in response to insulin, we treated C2C12 myotubes with insulin for several time points and assayed cell lysates for Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2 B, we detected Stat5 activation in myotubes at the earliest time point tested (2 min). This response peaked at 10 min, and the decline was evident by 20 min. These results suggest that the Stat5 activation by insulin in myotubes is rapid and transient. We were surprised that the Stat5 activation in response to insulin in C2C12 cells was relatively weak compared with the response we observed in skeletal muscle in vivo (Fig. 1). Since Stat5 and IRS-1 are recruited to the same phosphorylated residue on the IR (Tyr(P)-972) (14Sawka-Verhelle D. Filloux C. Tartare-Deckert S. Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trub T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), we speculated that IRS-1 and Stat5 might be competing for recruitment to limited amounts of IR in the C2C12 cells. We therefore performed biochemical analysis of C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes with regard to the expression levels and insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation levels of several IR substrates (Fig. 3). Although IR β-subunit expression and insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation are equivalent in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes, IRS-1 protein expression is extremely high in the C2C12 myoblasts, which could block efficient recruitment of Stat5 proteins to the IR in the myoblasts. Consistent with this observation, in C2C12 myotubes, where insulin-stimulated Stat5 activation is detected, IRS-1 expression is reduced 3–5-fold, and Stat5 expression is increased 4–5-fold. Nevertheless, the level of Stat5 activation by insulin in C2C12 myotubes is significantly less than that observed in skeletal muscle. We therefore performed a direct comparison of the levels of IR, IRS-1, IRS-2, and Stat5 proteins in lysates from isolated skeletal muscle, C2C12 myoblasts, and C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 3 A). Isolated skeletal muscle, C2C12 myoblasts, and C2C12 myotubes express equivalent levels of IR protein. In contrast, the expression of IRS-1 and IRS-2 is dramatically lower in skeletal muscle compared with the immortalized C2C12 cells. These data are consistent with our hypothesis that the high expression levels of IRS proteins prevent ef"

The mechanism of StAR's action is not established. To address mechanistic issues, we assessed the binding of StAR to artificial membranes by fluorescence resonance energy transfer using endogenous StAR tryptophan residues as the donor and dansyl-phosphatidylethanolamine in the bilayer as the acceptor. Mixing StAR with dansyl-labeled vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine increased the fluorescence intensity of dansyl emission excited at 280 nm by 10–40%. This interaction was dependent on pH, with a maximum at pH 3.0–3.5 and essentially no change above pH 5. Binding experiments at different temperatures and various combinations of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, and cholesterol showed that binding involves an electrostatic step and one or more other steps. Although binding prefers a thermodynamically ordered bilayer, the rate-limiting step occurs either when the bilayer is in a fluid state or when there is cholesterol-induced membrane heterogeneity. Experiments with fluorescence and light scattering indicate that StAR binding promotes ordering and aggregation of anionic membranes. The inactive StAR mutant R182L had lower affinity for the membrane, and the partially active mutant L275P had intermediate affinity.

The crucial role of StAR in human physiology is best illustrated by the findings in congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia, which is caused by mutations in the StAR gene (4Bose H.S. Sugawara T.

Affected individuals have female external genitalia irrespective of chromosomal sex and die in infancy from mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid deficiency if not diagnosed and treated with hormonal replacement therapy (6Hauffa B.P. Miller W.L. Grumbach M.M. Conte F.A. Kaplan S.L. Clin. Endocrinol. 1985; 23: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The mechanism of StAR's action is unknown. StAR is synthesized as a 37-kDa phosphoprotein that is cleaved to a 30-kDa form upon mitochondrial entry (1Clark B.J. Wells J. King S.R. Stocco D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28314-28322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). However, StAR's action requires new protein synthesis, and the 15–30-min time course of StAR's action correlates more closely with the presence of the cytoplasmic 37-kDa precursor than with the 2–3-h half-life of the intramitochondrial 30-kDa form (7Stocco D.M.

Furthermore, deletion of 62 amino-terminal residues (N-62 StAR), which includes the mitochondrial leader peptide, results in an extramitochondrial protein that is fully active both when expressed in living cells and when expressed in bacteria and added to isolated mitochondria in vitro (10Arakane F.

Biol. 1999; 69: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). By contrast, StAR is inactivated by deleting just 28 C-terminal amino acids (5Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Saenger P. Rogol A. Miller W.L. Science. 1995; 267: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), and all StAR mutations that cause congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia are found in C-terminal domains, suggesting that this region is responsible for StAR's activity (4Bose H.S. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Miller W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 5Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Saenger P. Rogol A. Miller W.L. Science. 1995; 267: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). In addition, biophysical studies indicate that StAR acts on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) while undergoing a pH-dependent transition to a molten globule (14Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7250-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the 37-kDa “preprotein” acts on the OMM as a molten globule and is then inactivated by mitochondrial import and cleavage to generate the inactive 30-kDa intramitochondrial protein (13Miller W.L. Strauss III, J.F. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Recently, Tsujishita and Hurley (15Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) suggested a different model based on the 2.2-Å resolution structure of the StAR-like domain of MLN64 (MLN64 residues 216–445), a protein that has 35% amino acid sequence identity with StAR (16Moog-Lutz C. Tomasetto C. Regnier C.H. Wendling C. Lutz Y. Muller D. Chenard M.P. Basset P. Rio M.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and has StAR-like activity in vivoand in vitro (12Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Huang M.C. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11722-11731Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Watari H. Arakane F. Moog-Lutz C. Kallen C.B. Tomasetto C. Gerton G.L. Rio M.C. Baker M.E. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8462-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This structure showed that StAR-like proteins have a large hydrophobic tunnel that binds one molecule of cholesterol. The data were interpreted to mean that StAR acts in the mitochondrial intramembranous space (IMS) to shuttle cholesterol one molecule at a time from the OMM to the inner mitochondrial membrane. This “IMS/shuttle” model of StAR's action was viewed as being inconsistent with the interpretation that N-62 StAR acts on the OMM and forms a molten globule (15Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). StAR is active with isolated mitochondria in which proteins associated with the OMM have been inactivated by heat denaturation or partial proteolysis with trypsin, and StAR can transfer cholesterol to intracellular membranes other than OMM. These results suggest that StAR interacts directly with membrane phospholipids and does not require a specific receptor protein (18Kallen C.B. Billheimer J.T. Summers S.A. Stayrook S.E. Lewis M. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26285-26288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to study the interactions of biosynthetic N-62 StAR with lipids in synthetic unilamellar vesicles of known composition. By measuring resonance energy transfer to synthetic dansylated membranes, we now show that N-62 StAR interacts with membrane lipids in a pH-dependent fashion that supports the molten globule hypothesis. CD spectroscopy of N-62 StAR in lipid environments also indicates a pH-dependent molten globule. Features of both the OMM/molten globule hypothesis and the IMS/shuttle hypothesis appear to be necessary to account for StAR's behavior. Wild type and mutant 6-His-N-62 StAR proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (19Bose H.S. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9768-9775Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Dansyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (dansyl-PE) and laurdan were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), tetraoleoyl cardiolipin, and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). All other reagents were obtained from standard sources. Vesicles were prepared by mixing phospholipids with or without 2 mol % (of the final lipid concentration) dansyl-PE and with or without 50 mol % cholesterol (dissolved in chloroform). The lipids were dried under N2to remove chloroform and then hydrated with 20 mm acetate buffer (pH 4) containing 150 mm KCl to give a 10 mm final bulk lipid concentration. The hydrated lipids were heated to 37 °C to ensure that the mixture was above the lipid phase transition temperature and incubated for 1 h with intermittent mixing by rapid agitation. The resulting multilamellar vesicles were sonicated three times for 3 min each using a probe sonicator to obtain small (100–200-Å diameter) unilamellar vesicles (SUV). Ambient temperature was maintained constant in the sample during sonication with a water bath. DMPC vesicles were sonicated at 35 °C to ensure that SUV formation occurred above the phase transition temperature. The binding of wild type and variant StAR proteins to phospholipid vesicles was assessed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer using tryptophan residues in the protein as the donor and dansyl-PE in the membrane as the acceptor. Energy transfer was assayed using a photon-counting spectrofluorometer (Instruments SA) (20Bell J.D. Burnside M. Owen J.A. Royall M.L. Baker M.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4945-4955Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Excitation was set at the maximum for Trp (280 nm), and the emission of dansyl-PE was measured at 510 nm (4.25-nm band pass). Simultaneous assessment of fluorescence intensity at multiple excitation and emission wavelengths was obtained by rapid sluing of monochromator mirrors using control software provided with the instrument. Alternatively, energy transfer was also assessed from excitation spectra with emission at 510 nm. Measurements of the physical state of membranes containing the bilayer probe, laurdan, were obtained using a PC1 fluorometer from ISS (Urbana, IL). Diluents ranged in pH from 2.0 to 7.0 and contained 150 mm KCl with 20 mm phosphate, citrate, acetate, or HEPES buffers as appropriate for the target pH. The temperature was maintained at 37 °C or as indicated in the relevant figure using circulating water baths. Continuous gentle magnetic stirring preserved sample homogeneity in both instruments. For binding experiments by energy transfer, SUV (50 μmlipid) were equilibrated to the temperature in the sample compartment of the fluorometer, and base-line fluorescence intensity was recorded. The procedure was then repeated following incremental additions of StAR protein. Energy transfer was observed as an increase in fluorescence intensity (excited at 280 nm) upon the addition of protein. Some direct excitation of dansyl-PE also occurs at 280 nm, and this excitation may likewise be affected by the binding of protein. To distinguish these effects from true energy transfer, the direct fluorescence of dansyl-PE was measured simultaneously (excitation = 340 nm, emission = 510 nm). The energy transfer was then corrected for changes in dansyl intrinsic fluorescence by calculating the ratio of fluorescence excited at 280 nm to that excited at 340 nm. When experiments involved the pH dependence of energy transfer with charged lipids, the results were normalized to the intensity at 300 nm. This change in analysis procedure was required by the presence of an optical artifact at 340 nm with anionic membranes at low pH. Laurdan (1.2 μm) dissolved in Me2SO was incorporated into liposomes prior to sonication, and SUV were prepared as described above without dansyl-PE. SUV were equilibrated in the fluorometer sample chamber to the indicated temperatures, and emission spectra were acquired (excitation = 350 nm). The procedure was then repeated at each temperature in the presence of N-62 StAR. Effects of temperature and the binding of the protein on the emission spectrum were quantified by calculating the value of generalized polarization (GP) from the spectra as described (21Parasassi T. De Stasio G. Ravagnan G. Rusch R.M. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 179-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Far UV (200–250 nm) CD measurements were carried out in a 1.0-mm path length flat cuvette in a Jasco-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier-controlled temperature system. All lipids and protein samples were mixed with the same buffer system that was used for the fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements and were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min prior to recording the spectrum. Appropriate base lines were obtained under the same experimental conditions and were subtracted from the sample spectra. In some spectra, the noise was reduced by application of a Savitsky-Golay filter. The apparent binding of N-62 StAR to vesicle surfaces was readily detected by resonance energy transfer. The fluorescence excitation spectrum of SUV containing 2% dansyl-PE has a minimum at 280 nm and a peak at 340 nm, representing intrinsic dansyl fluorescence. The addition of StAR elicits a small decrease in dansyl intrinsic fluorescence and a substantial increase in fluorescence intensity at 280–300 nm (Fig.1 A). The ratio of the two spectra from Fig. 1 A shows a peak at 280 nm consistent with a tryptophan absorption spectrum and indicating resonance energy transfer between one or more StAR tryptophans and dansyl-PE in the membrane (Fig. 1 B). Increasing concentrations of N-62 StAR enhanced dansyl fluorescence of SUV made of either PC or 1:1 PC/cholesterol (Fig.2 A). The effect was saturable and fit a simple binding model with an apparent KDof ∼0.2 μm in each case. The binding was very sensitive to pH; no binding was detected at pH 7.0 (not shown), and binding was maximal at pH 3.0–3.5 (Fig. 2 B), which corresponds to the pH range at which StAR forms a molten globule structure (14Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7250-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This ability of StAR to bind to unilamellar lipid bilayers lacking intrinsic membrane proteins supports the view that StAR acts directly on phospholipid membranes and does not require a receptor. The binding of StAR was also critically dependent on small variations in the sequence of the StAR protein. The StAR missense mutant R182L causes severe congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia and is wholly inactive in transfected cells, whereas the mutant L275P causes less severe disease and retains about 10% of normal activity in transfected cells (4Bose H.S. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Miller W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic analyses have shown that the R182L mutant is grossly misfolded, while the L275P mutant has a nearly normal fold (19Bose H.S. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9768-9775Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The R182L and L275P mutants of N-62 StAR bound to SUV composed of either PC or 1:1 PC/cholesterol but differed from wild-type N-62 StAR and from each other in their affinities for the bilayer (Fig.3). The average values forKD measured between pH 4.0 and 2.0 were 0.16 ± 0.02 μm for wild type, 1.03 ± 0.26 μmfor L275P, and 3.1 ± 1.2 μm for R182L (mean ± S.E., n = 28, 8, and 10, respectively). These differences were statistically significant by two-way analyses of variance (p < 0.0001) at all pH values tested with or without the presence of cholesterol. The statistical analysis of KDfor the binding of StAR to PC SUV detected a major effect of pH and differences in the effect of pH on the wild-type and mutant StAR sequences (Fig. 4). Below pH 4, wild-type N-62 StAR bound more efficiently to SUV composed of PC alone, whereas the two mutants showed little difference in binding between PC and PC/cholesterol SUV as a function of pH (Fig. 4 A). These results were confirmed statistically by two-way analysis of variance for both the effects of pH (p < 0.0001) and cholesterol content (p = 0.002) as well as the interaction between the two variables apparent for wild type protein in Fig. 4 A (p = 0.011). A similar analysis revealed no statistical significance for either mutant (Fig. 4,B and C). Cholesterol tends to aggregate into cholesterol-rich domains when mixed 1:1 with PC (22Worthman L.A.D. Nag K. Davis P.J. Keough K.M.W. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2569-2580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), therefore creating domains relatively deficient in dansyl groups. The data in Fig. 4 suggest that wild type, but not the mutant forms of N-62 StAR, binds with increasing avidity to cholesterol-rich domains as pH decreases so that N-62 StAR is sequestered away from regions of the membrane that contain dansyl groups. This interpretation is consistent with the effect of N-62 StAR to make the environment of dansyl-PE more rigid in the absence of cholesterol but more fluid in the presence (Fig. 5). Thus, although the presence of cholesterol is not required for StAR to interact with PC membranes, it substantially alters StAR's binding characteristics.Figure 5Effect of pH on SUV membranes. A, the intrinsic fluorescence of the dansyl-PE in vesicles composed of PC alone (circles) or 1:1 PC/cholesterol (triangles) was measured before (closed symbols) and after (open symbols) the addition of 0.14 μm N-62 StAR at the pH values shown. The data represent one example of four independent experiments.B, the difference in intrinsic dansyl fluorescence induced by the addition of StAR was calculated from A for SUV composed of PC alone (open circles) and 1:1 PC/cholesterol (closed triangles). The data represent the mean ± S.E., n = 4. The effect of cholesterol (p < 0.0001) and the interaction between the pH and cholesterol content (p = 0.0027) were significant by two-way analysis of variance. C, the similarity in the effects of StAR on both PC and PC/cholesterol SUV at pH 4 and the gross differences in the effects of StAR on PC and PC/cholesterol SUV at pH 2.5 were consistent at all StAR concentrations above 0.14 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The StAR-induced reduction in dansyl intrinsic fluorescence (340 nm) (Fig.1 A) suggested that the binding of StAR alters the physical state of the membrane. Because CD data show that changes in pH affect StAR's conformation (14Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7250-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we considered whether changes in pH would also affect the physical state of SUV and their interaction with StAR. In the presence or absence of N-62 StAR, the fluorescence was stable at pH ≥4.0 and decreased proportionately as pH was reduced (Fig.5 A). The fractional decrement in fluorescence intensity was greater for SUV containing cholesterol (Fig. 5 A,triangles) than for SUV composed of PC alone (circles). Although StAR influenced the pH dependence of dansyl-PE in the two forms of SUV only slightly, this influence was reproducible in opposite directions (Fig. 5 B) and required the same concentrations of StAR at which binding occurred (Fig.5 C). Similar results were obtained with the R182L and L275P mutants (data not shown). The dimethylamine group in the dansyl fluorophore titrates between pH 2.0 and 4.0 and no longer absorbs at 340 nm in the protonated state (23Vaz W.L.C. Nicksch A. Jähnig F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 83: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The pK for this reaction depends on the surrounding lipids; a lower pK corresponds to increased membrane fluidity, and higher pK corresponds to increased membrane structure, order, and rigidity (23Vaz W.L.C. Nicksch A. Jähnig F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 83: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 5 A suggest a pK of <2 for dansyl-PE in a fluid PC bilayer and a pK between 2.0 and 2.5 in a more rigid PC/cholesterol membrane. Thus, the binding of StAR increased the pK of dansyl-PE in PC membranes, suggesting that those membranes had become more rigid (Fig. 5 A). This effect is common for proteins that bind to the surfaces of lipid membranes (24Heimburg T. Biltonen R.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 84-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By contrast, StAR decreased the pK of dansyl-PE in PC/cholesterol membranes (Fig. 5 A), indicating increased fluidity. This enhanced fluidity is consistent with aggregation of cholesterol away from phospholipid-rich regions of the bilayer where dansyl-PE would reside. This result would be predicted thermodynamically if StAR binds preferentially to and thus stabilizes cholesterol-rich regions. To pursue the suggestion that StAR binding might affect membrane order, we varied the fluidity of the bilayer by altering the temperature. Because the phase transition of PC from gel to liquid crystalline phases occurs at temperatures below 0 °C, we instead prepared vesicles from DMPC, whose phase transition occurs at ambient temperature. This choice of lipid allowed us to test the binding of StAR to both the liquid crystalline and the gel phases of SUV without freezing the sample. It also permitted us to reach the liquid phase at temperatures low enough to avoid denaturing the protein. As with PC vesicles, increasing concentrations of N-62 StAR enhanced dansyl fluorescence in DMPC and 1:1 DMPC/cholesterol SUV in a saturable manner (Fig. 6 A). The binding of N-62 StAR to DMPC SUV was similar to its binding to PC or PC/cholesterol SUV (compare with Fig. 2 A; maximumI280/I340 = 0.16–0.19 for PC, PC/cholesterol, and DMPC). However, the binding to DMPC/cholesterol SUV was more than doubled. Increasing the temperature from 15 to 25 °C increased energy transfer, but there was little if any effect of increasing the temperature further to 35 °C (Fig.6 B). Thus the binding of N-62 StAR appeared favored by increased membrane fluidity. The binding of N-62 StAR to SUV of various compositions suggests that StAR should prefer a more ordered membrane over one that is fluid (Figs. 5 A and 6 A); however, binding apparently preferred the more fluid liquid crystalline state of DMPC above the phase transition temperature of 22 °C (Fig. 6 B). To explore this apparent inconsistency, we assessed bilayer fluidity in DMPC and DMPC/cholesterol SUV as a function of temperature, with or without StAR, using the fluorescent membrane probe laurdan. The emission spectrum of laurdan is very sensitive to the polarity of the membrane environment; the spectrum displays large red shifts when the number and/or mobility of water molecules partitioned at the level of the phospholipid glycerol backbones has increased (21Parasassi T. De Stasio G. Ravagnan G. Rusch R.M. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 179-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Thus, enhancing bilayer fluidity allows water to have greater access to laurdan and thus shifts the emission spectrum toward longer wavelengths. These spectral shifts are quantified by calculation of GP, which varies from −1 (most disordered) to +1 (most ordered) (21Parasassi T. De Stasio G. Ravagnan G. Rusch R.M. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 179-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Laurdan readily detected the normal DMPC phase transition near 22 °C, whereas vesicles composed of 1:1 DMPC/cholesterol remained ordered throughout the temperature range (Fig. 6 C). The addition of N-62 StAR had little effect on the fluidity of DMPC SUV containing cholesterol, but in the absence of cholesterol N-62 StAR raised the phase transition temperature 5 °C. These data indicate that StAR stabilizes the gel state of the bilayer, thus corroborating the observations in Fig.5. Thus, the temperature dependence results (Fig. 6 B) required further analysis. One possibility is that the binding results obtained with DMPC membranes represent kinetic effects rather than the thermodynamics of the binding interaction. To test this possibility, we assayed the binding of StAR to DMPC SUV by increasing the temperature incrementally from 15 to 35 °C and then decreasing the temperature back to 15 °C (Fig. 6 D). Consistent with the data in Fig.6 B, binding increased as the temperature was raised, but instead of returning to the original level when the sample was cooled, the binding increased. Thus, the system was not at equilibrium at each temperature because the binding of StAR to lipid in the gel state depended on sample history; heating the vesicles to a temperature above the phase transition apparently removed a kinetic barrier to binding. The increased order of DMPC SUV when they contain cholesterol helps to explain the effect of cholesterol to enhance binding above 22 °C. However, differences in bilayer fluidity cannot account for the differences in StAR binding between DMPC SUV with and without cholesterol at lower temperatures, because the fluidity of the two types of vesicles detected by laurdan was similar at 15–20 °C (Fig.6 C). These observations may be explained by the tendency of cholesterol to form domains in membranes (22Worthman L.A.D. Nag K. Davis P.J. Keough K.M.W. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2569-2580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The kinetic barrier evidenced in Fig. 6 D is probably created by a homogeneous and well ordered membrane, such as that formed by DMPC SUV in the gel phase. The domain structure of DMPC/cholesterol vesicles may behave like the fluid phase of DMPC membranes by disrupting the regular surface structure and thus removing the kinetic barrier. Similar phenomena have been observed with other proteins where kinetic barriers"

Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6185-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).

With only a few exceptions to the rule CIITA functions as a “master regulator” for MHC-II expression (2Harton J.A. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6185-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). During B-cell development MHC-II expression is turned on at a very early stage and turned off when B-cells terminally differentiate into plasma cells (6Halper J. Fu S.M. Wang C.-Y. Winchester R. Kunkel H.G. J. Immunol. 1978; 120: 1480-1484PubMed Google Scholar, 7Burrows P.D. Cooper M.D. Semin. Immunol. 1990; 2: 189-195PubMed Google Scholar). The process of extinguishing MHC-II expression in plasma cells is poorly understood. Cell-cell fusion between MHC-II-negative myeloma cells and MHC-II-positive B-cells have indicated the presence of a dominant repressor in the myeloma cell. (8Sartoris S. Tosi G. De Lerma Barbaro A.

Latron F. Maffei A. Scarpellino L. Accolla R.S. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2902-2910PubMed Google Scholar). It was later shown that CIITA mRNA transcripts are absent in myeloma cells, and introduction of CIITA rescues MHC-II expression (13Silacci P. Mottet A. Steimle V. Reith W. Mach B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, the dominant repressor of MHC-II expression appears to act by repressing CIITA expression. CIITA has four distinct promoters, each transcribing a unique Exon 1, with three of the forms predominating (14Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Otten L.A. Steimle V. Mach B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). CIITA expression in B-cells is predominantly from promoter 3 (14Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Otten L.A. Steimle V. Mach B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 15Piskurich J.F. Wang Y. Linhoff M.W. White L.C. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 233-240PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently characterized the CIITA promoter 3 (CIITAp3) in B-cells (16Ghosh N. Piskurich J.F. Wright G. Hassani K. Ting J.P. Wright K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32342-32350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In vivo, two elements on the promoter, ARE-1 and ARE-2, are occupied and essential for CIITA expression. However in the myeloma cell line NCI-H929, the CIITAp3 is completely unoccupied suggesting that CIITA transcription in myeloma cells may be mediated through changes in promoter assembly (16Ghosh N. Piskurich J.F. Wright G. Hassani K. Ting J.P. Wright K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32342-32350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One of the transcription factors induced when B-cells differentiate into plasma cells is PRDI-BF1. It has been shown that introduction of the murine homologue of PRDI-BF1 (Blimp-1) into B-cell lymphoma cell lines leads to many phenotypic changes associated with differentiation into early plasma cells, (17Turner Jr., C.A. Mack D.H. Davis M.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 297-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Despite its dramatic effect on B-cells, only two targets for PRDI-BF1 have been identified, c-myc(18Lin Y. Wong K. Calame K. Science. 1997; 276: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and IFN-β (22Keller A.D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In this report we now show that PRDI-BF1 directly suppresses CIITA transcription. This results in the silencing of MHC-II expression is long observed in plasma cells and multiple myeloma and as such may be an attractive target for therapeutic regulation of MHC-II. The CIITAp3 reporter constructs (16Ghosh N. Piskurich J.F. Wright G. Hassani K. Ting J.P. Wright K.L. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) have been described previously. The pc-PRDI-BF1 vector was FLAG-tagged at the C-terminal end of PRDI-BF1. The three protein deletions, pcPRDI-BF1ΔPR (deletes amino acids 36–166), pcPRDI-BF1ΔPro (deletes amino acids 308–399), and pcPRDI-BF1ΔZnF (deletes amino acids 508 to 691), were generated in the pc-PRDI-BF1-FLAG construct. All constructs have been confirmed by sequencing. Raji, IM-9, and CA46 are B-lymphoblastoid cells. U266, 8266, SKO, and NCI-H929 cells are multiple myeloma cells. All cells were grown according to ATCC specifications. Cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (16Ghosh N. Piskurich J.F. Wright G. Hassani K. Ting J.P. Wright K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32342-32350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Transfections were normalized by cotransfecting a constant amount of pRL-TK construct (Promega). To make direct comparisons between the effect of PRDI-BF1 on c-myc and CIITA promoters, the control lanes were set at 100 for both TSA− and TSA+ samples. Two peptide sequences N-terminal 1–17 residues and C-terminal 720–737 residues were selected to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits (Research Genetics). The antibodies were affinity purified from the serum. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignamet al. (21Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acid Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed as described previously (16Ghosh N. Piskurich J.F. Wright G. Hassani K. Ting J.P. Wright K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32342-32350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) using synthetic oligonucleotides, 2 μg of poly(dI·dC), and nuclear extract or in vitro-translated proteins. The PRDI-BF1 oligonucleotide spans from −190 to −158 base pairs of the promoter. Unlabeled oligonucleotide competitors were used in a 50–100-fold molar excess. RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Ribonuclease protection analysis was performed using a 32P-labeled probe containing the C-terminal (Kpn-I and Xho-I) portion of PRDI-BF1. The RNA probe was hybridized with 15 μg of sample RNA, and digestion was performed using RNase A/T1 (Ambion) according to manufacturer's specifications. Whole cell extract was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity beads (Sigma) were used to immunoprecipitate overexpressed FLAG-tagged proteins. Endogenous PRDI-BF1 was immunoprecipitated with protein A-agarose beads and the N- or C-terminal PRDI-BF1 antibody at 4 °C for 1 h. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with the indicated primary antibody for 2 h followed by an anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase antibody. The secondary antibody was visualized by ECL plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For direct Western blots or immunoprecipitations 1 × 106 or 5 × 106 cells were used per lane, respectively. In vitro transcription/translation of PRDI-BF1 and PRDI-BFΔPR proteins were performed using the TNT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) according to manufacturer's specifications. pCDNA blank vector was used as a control. The 35S-labeled proteins were resolved by an SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography to estimate the yield of full-length product prior to use in the DNA binding assays. We have previously reported that endogenous CIITA mRNA levels in myeloma cell lines are significantly lower compared with B-cells (16Ghosh N. Piskurich J.F. Wright G. Hassani K. Ting J.P. Wright K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32342-32350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similarly, we observed that a CIITAp3 promoter construct with 1140 or 545 bp of promoter sequences had low activity in myeloma cells, similar to an SV40 minimal promoter whereas in B-cell lines the CIITA promoter was 2–4 times more active in comparison (data not shown). This suggested that the repression of CIITA transcription might be contained within the first 545 bp of the promoter. Progressive 5′ deletions of CIITAp3 were transiently transfected into two myeloma cell lines and tested for promoter activity. As shown in Fig.1 A deletion of the region from −195 to −151 bp resulted in a 7-fold increase in promoter activity in U266 cells and a 3.2-fold increase in NCI-H929 cells. Further deletion down to position −113 bp removes the previously identified activator element ARE-1 and severely diminished promoter activity. This indicates that the factors necessary for activation of CIITAp3 are present in the myeloma cells, but overall activity is silenced by elements between −195 and −151. Homology searches suggested that the region between −180 and −168 bp could be a putative binding site for the transcriptional repressor, PRDI-BF1. To test whether PRDI-BF1 was able to repress CIITAp3, the protein was transiently overexpressed in B-cells. Introduction of PRDI-BF1 repressed transcription from the CIITA promoter (CIITAp3.195) by 60% as compared with vector control (Fig. 1 B). Deletion of the potential PRDI-BF1 binding site (CIITAp3.151) leads to the inability of PRDI-BF1 to significantly repress CIITA transcription. These findings and the observation that the murine homologue of PRDI-BF1 is low or absent in B-cells and increases in plasma cells (17Turner Jr., C.A. Mack D.H. Davis M.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 297-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) suggest that endogenous PRDI-BF1 in human myeloma cells could be repressing CIITA transcription by binding to this site on the promoter. The relative amount of PRDI-BF1 mRNA in myeloma cells and B-cells was determined with a ribonuclease protection assay (Fig.2 A) and also confirmed by Northern blotting (data not shown). Each of the myeloma cell lines contained PRDI-BF1 mRNA whereas it was undetectable in B-cell lines. We next examined the level of PRDI-BF1 protein present in myeloma cells by immunoprecipitation. PRDI-BF1-specific antibodies were raised against N- and C-terminal peptides. Both antibodies specifically immunoprecipitated a band of ∼100 kDa from myeloma cells. The band comigrates with PRDI-BF1 protein expressed from the cloned cDNA when transfected into a B-cell line (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2). Importantly, we also tested for the presence of PRDI-BF1 in bone marrow samples from myeloma patients. Although these samples contain only 68 to 92% myeloma cells, PRDI-BF1 was clearly visible in 2 of 3 patients (Fig. 2 C). Thus PRDI-BF1 is present in myeloma cells concomitant with the loss of CIITA expression. Identification of direct PRDI-BF1 binding to the region between −195 and −151 bp of the promoter was done with a series of in vitro protein/DNA binding studies utilizing the EMSA. Incubation of an oligonucleotide spanning −190 to −158 bp with nuclear extracts from myeloma cells revealed two specific complexes, which were competed by an unlabeled self-oligonucleotide (Fig.3 A). Competition with consensus binding sites such as an interferon response factor element (lane 3) that have similarity to the PRDI-BF1 site did not alter complexes. To directly identify that PRDI-BF1 is part of the complexes bound to DNA the U266 nuclear extracts were immunodepleted of PRDI-BF1 by using either the N- or C-terminal antibody. Western blots indicate that nearly all of the PRDI-BF1 was removed (Fig. 3 B). EMSAs performed using these depleted extracts showed that the upper complex completely disappeared, whereas the lower complex was reduced in intensity (Fig. 3 C,lanes 1–3). Confirmation that only PRDI-BF1 was depleted and that the extract was not degraded was achieved using either a B-cell specific activator protein (lanes 4–6) or nuclear factor-1 (not shown) consensus binding site in the EMSA assay. The difference between the two complexes containing PRDI-BF1 is not known as yet, but it is possible that PRDI-BF1 is found in multiple isoforms or that it can complex with other proteins. The PRDI-BF1 protein had been first identified by its ability to bind and repress the PRDI site within the IFN-β promoter, following viral induction (22Keller A.D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It is a 789-amino acid protein (depicted in Fig.4 A) bearing N- and C-terminal acidic domains, a PR domain homologous to RIZ and MDSI-EVI proteins (23Buyse I.M. Shao G. Huang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4467-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), a proline-rich domain between amino acids 331 and 389, and a C-terminal zinc finger DNA binding motif. It has been demonstrated that the proline-rich domain of PRDI-BF1 is able to recruit the Groucho family of corepressors (20Ren B. Chee K.J. Kim T.H. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), which in turn can interact with histone deacetylases (24Chen G. Fernandez J. Mische S. Courey A.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2218-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). This suggested that the proline-rich domain was critical for transcriptional repression. To identify the domains responsible for PRDI-BF1-mediated repression of CIITA we constructed three individual domain deletions in the protein and obtained two N-terminal deletions of the protein that maintain DNA binding activity (a kind gift from T. Maniatis). We transiently overexpressed these proteins with the CIITAp3.195 reporter in CA46 B-cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Several observations have been made. First, deletion of the zinc finger DNA binding motif abolishes PRDI-BF1 activity (lanes 7 versus 2). Second, deletion of the acidic and PR domains does not affect repressive ability (lanes 3 versus 2), but deletion of the acidic, PR, and proline-rich domains completely ablates PRDI-BF1 function (lanes 4 versus 2). Finally, internal deletion of only the proline-rich domain does not affect repression (lanes 6 versus 2), whereas internal deletion of the PR domain partially (30%) abrogates PRDI-BF1 function (lanes 5 versus 2). These findings indicate that a complex interplay of multiple repression domains exists within the N terminus of the protein. The proline-rich alone (lanes 3 versus 4) or the acidic and PR domains alone (lanes 6 versus 2) are sufficient for full activity. Because internal deletion of the PR domain maintains only partial function, this suggests that PR domain is a key contributor to repressive activity of PRDI-BF1. However, which domain is most critical for CIITA repression remains unclear. Because deletion of the PR domain partially ablates the ability of the protein to repress CIITA, it is essential to know whether this effect is because of deletion of the PR domain or mis-folding of the recombinant protein. One way to address the structure of the recombinant protein is to determine whether it maintains DNA binding activity. EMSA was performed using in vitro-translated PRDI-BF1 and PRDI-BF1ΔPR proteins to make a quantitative comparison between the DNA binding activity of the two. Similar levels of both proteins of the expected molecular weight were expressed by in vitro translation (Fig. 4 C). As observed in Fig.4 D both proteins had comparable DNA binding activities. This finding provides evidence that the loss of activity is not because of catastrophic mis-folding although minor alterations are possible. In addition, all the recombinant proteins were abundantly expressed when transfected into CA46 B-cells. Detection of the protein expression levels was performed by Western blot (Fig. 4 B). It has been recently shown that the murine homologue of PRDI-BF1 (Blimp-1) is able to repress c-mycexpression by recruitment of histone deacetylase (25Yu J. Angelin-Duclos C. Greenwood J. Liao J. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2592-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This recruitment was reported to be through the proline-rich domain. Our data in Fig.4 A indicates that the deletion of the proline-rich domain did not affect the repression of CIITA. Although the proline-rich domain might have multiple functions, this suggests that histone deacetylases might not be required for CIITA repression. To test the importance of HDAC activity more directly we inhibited HDAC activity and examined the effects on c-myc and CIITA transcription. Addition of a histone deacetylase inhibitor, TSA, had no effect on transcriptional repression of CIITA; however, consistent with the previous study it completely abolished repression of c-myc(Table I). A similar independence from HDAC activity was also observed with endogenous PRDI-BF1. U266 myeloma cells were transfected with the CIITA promoter construct only in the presence or absence of TSA. If HDACs were involved in repression of CIITA then a relief of repression would be observed upon addition of TSA. However, no change in transcriptional activity was detected between the TSA-treated and untreated cells. This clearly indicates that PRDI-BF1-mediated repression of CIITAp3 does not require HDACs.Table ICells were cotransfected with reporter plasmid and 5 μg of empty expression vector (control) or PRDI-BF1 vector and divided into two sets, one treated with 100 ng/ml TSA and the other without. The luciferase activity for both promoters in the presence of empty expression vectors was normalized at 100 relative luciferase units.CellsReporterControlNo TSA-Fold repressionTSA-Fold repressionCA46CIITAp310048.9 ± 4.02.042.8 ± 8.72.3CA46c-myc10042.6 ± 11.62.3122.8 ± 15.40.8U266CIITAp3153.7 ± 27.6143.0 ± 25.9 Open table in a new tab With respect to PRDI-BF1-mediated repression of CIITA, our findings demonstrate a role of the PR domain in transcription repression. The PR domain of two related family members, RIZ and MDSI-EVI1, has been reported (26Xie M. Shao G. Buyse I.M. Huang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26360-26366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to significantly alter the function of the protein and mediate protein-protein interaction (27Huang S. Shao G. Liu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15933-15939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The PR domain shares significant sequence identity to the yeast SET domain of proteins that play an important role in determining chromosomal structure and telomeric gene silencing. However the precise mechanism by which PR domains bring about transcriptional repression has not yet been characterized. It has been shown that RIZ1 has tumor suppressor ability, and deletion of the PR domain promotes oncogenesis. A similar observation was noted in the MDS1-EVI1 gene (28Fears S. Mathieu C. Zeleznik-Le N. Huang S. Rowley J.D. Nucifora G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1642-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The PR domain of MDS1-EVI1 is a common target of viral insertions and chromosomal translocations in leukemogenesis (29Morishita K. Parker D.S. Mucenski M.L. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1988; 54: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 30Morishita K. Parganas E. William C.L. Whittaker M.H. Drabkin H. Oval J. Taetle R. Valentine M.B. Ihle J.N. Proc.

Rowley J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4004-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) suggesting it may have an important biological function. Other regions within PRDI-BF1 can partially compensate for loss of the PR domain. An N-terminal truncation of the protein eliminating the acidic and PR domain but retaining the proline-rich domain is still able to confer repressive activity. This suggests that the proline-rich domain is a good candidate for such a compensatory effect. In addition, deletion of the N-terminal acidic domain of Blimp-1 significantly reduced its ability to repress c-myc (25Yu J. Angelin-Duclos C. Greenwood J. Liao J. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2592-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Thus PRDI-BF1 (Blimp-1) appears to utilize multiple repression domains whose function is dependent on the target promoter. In summary, we have identified that PRDI-BF1 binds to CIITA promoter and silences CIITA expression in myeloma cells. This now defines the mechanism of MHC-II silencing in plasmacytomas first observed over 14 years ago (9Venkitaraman A.R. Culbert E.J. Feldman M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1441-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 12Dellabona P. Latron F. Maffei A. Scarpellino L. Accolla R.S. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2902-2910PubMed Google Scholar). By use of histone deacetylase inhibitors and specific deletions of PRDI-BF1 we have clearly demonstrated that the proline-rich domain and histone deacetylase activity are not required for PRDI-BF1-mediated repression of CIITA in contrast to their action on c-myc. The findings also suggest that that the highly conserved PR domain may have an important role in repression of CIITA.

https://openalex.org/W1994302602,"We have recently cloned a novel basic helix-loop-helix factor, CHF2, that functions as a transcriptional repressor. To address its role in the regulation of myogenic terminal differentiation, we analyzed its expression pattern during C2C12 mouse myotube formation. In undifferentiated myoblasts, CHF2 is expressed at high levels. After induction of myotube formation in low serum, CHF2 expression is barely detectable at 3 days after induction. Myogenin expression, in contrast, peaks at 3 days. In transiently transfected 10T1/2 embryonic fibroblasts, CHF2 inhibited MyoD-dependent activation of the myogenin promoter in a dose-dependent fashion. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis indicated that CHF2 inhibits the binding of the MyoD·E47 heterodimer to the E-box binding site. CHF2 also inhibited myogenic conversion of 10T1/2 cells by MyoD, as measured by skeletal myosin heavy chain protein expression. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis indicated that CHF2 forms a protein complex with MyoD. Mutational analysis of CHF2 indicated that the repression activity for both transcription and myogenic conversion mapped to a hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal region and did not require either the basic helix-loop-helix or YRPW motifs. Our data indicate that CHF2 functions as a transcriptional repressor of myogenesis by formation of an inactive heterodimeric complex with MyoD and likely plays an important role in muscle development.

Caudy M. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These proteins are thought to act as downstream effectors of Notch signaling, during embryo pattern formation and lateral inhibition of neurogenic and myogenic precursors. In the developing chick and zebrafish, hairy homologues are expressed in dynamic oscillating patterns that correlate with the generation of each somite (2Palmeirim I. Henrique D. Ish-Horowicz D. Pourquie O. Cell. 1997; 91: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 3Holley S.A. Geisler R. Nusslein-Volhard C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1678-1690PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently described two novel hairy-related bHLH proteins, CHF1 and CHF2, that function as transcriptional repressors and possibly regulate terminal differentiation (4Chin M.T. Maemura K.

Others have independently cloned the same genes (referred to as Hey2, Hrt2, and gridlock for CHF1; Hey1, Hrt1, and Hesr-1 for CHF2) and have described a transient expression pattern in the developing somites and limb buds, suggesting a potential role in skeletal muscle development (5Nakagawa O.

Science. 2000; 287: 1820-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). We have found that CHF2 is expressed at high levels in undifferentiated myoblasts. Accordingly, we have examined the role of CHF2 in vitro with established models of skeletal muscle differentiation. Skeletal muscle ontogeny has been extensively studied. The bHLH muscle regulatory factors MyoD, myogenin, Myf-5, and MRF4 are expressed hierarchically during mouse embryo development and serve as nodal regulators for myogenesis by turning on the transcription of a cascade of skeletal muscle specific genes (reviewed in Ref. 9Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Myogenesis is also negatively regulated by other helix-loop-helix proteins that function as transcriptional repressors, including Id (10Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar), MyoR (11Lu J. Webb R. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1996; 86: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To date, little is known about how members of the hairy family of transcriptional repressors act within the known hierarchy of skeletal muscle regulatory factors. The domain structure of hairy family members has been inferred from structure-function studies. Most members of the hairy family of transcriptional repressors have three functional domains. They contain a distinctive bHLH domain, an Orange domain, and a WRPW motif at or adjacent to the carboxyl terminus (reviewed in Ref. 1Fisher A. Caudy M. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The bHLH region is distinct by virtue of a proline in the basic region that is thought to affect the DNA binding specificity. Most of the hairy proteins bind to class B E-boxes or N-boxes (13Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 14Ohsako S. Hyer J. Panganiban G. Oliver I. Caudy M.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2729-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The Orange domain mediates interaction with specific transcriptional activators and is essential for full transcriptional repression (16Dawson S.R. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Parkhurst S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6923-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The WRPW motif is critical for recruitment of members of the groucho family of WD40 repeat proteins, which act as transcriptional corepressors (17Fisher A.L. Ohsako S. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). CHF1 and CHF2 are members of a novel subclass of hairy-related genes that diverge from other hairy proteins by the substitution of glycine for proline in the basic region and by the substitution of YRPW for WRPW near the carboxyl terminus (4Chin M.T. Maemura K. Fukumoto S. Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6381-6387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 5Nakagawa O.

To date, very little is known about how CHF1, CHF2, and their relatives function in vivo, although they are known to function in some contexts as transcriptional repressors (4Chin M.T. Maemura K. Fukumoto S. Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6381-6387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because of their relationship to other hairy proteins and their expression pattern in the developing somites and limb buds, we investigated the role of CHF1 and CHF2 in skeletal muscle differentiation. We found that CHF1 is not expressed in proliferating myoblasts, whereas CHF2 expression is high in myoblasts and is dramatically reduced after induction of terminal differentiation, as myogenin expression rises. We show that CHF1 and CHF2 act as repressors of the myogenin promoter, most likely by preventing the binding of the MyoD·E47 heterodimer to the E-box and by forming an inactive heterodimer with MyoD. CHF1 and CHF2 also repress myogenic conversion of 10T1/2 embryonic fibroblasts by MyoD, as measured by induction of skeletal myosin heavy chain protein expression. Mutational analysis of CHF2 demonstrated that the bHLH and the YRPW motifs are completely dispensable for repression of both myogenin transcription and myogenic conversion, suggesting that a previously undescribed alanine-rich region is required. Our results suggest that CHF1 and CHF2 may regulate the expression of myogenin in the developing somites and limb buds and thereby control the timing of myogenesis in vivo. The human CHF1 cDNA expression construct, the human arylhydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) expression construct, and the Myc-tagged MyoD expression construct pCS26MTMyoD have been described previously (4Chin M.T.

The myogenin core promoter/luciferase construct was created by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the 184-base pair myogenin core promoter (18Edmondson D.G. Cheng T.C. Cserjesi P. Chakraborty T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3665-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) from the template p184CAT with the primers 5′-CTCGAGCCTGCAGGGTGGGGTGGGGG-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTCCCCCAAGCTCCCGCAGCCC-3′. The PCR product was cloned directly into pCRII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). This insert was subsequently excised with the restriction enzymesXhoI and HindIII, and then cloned into theXhoI and HindIII sites of the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2basic (Promega, Madison, WI). The hCHF2 expression plasmid pcDNA-hCHF2 was constructed by taking the full-length 2.2-kbEcoRI/XhoI cDNA and cloning it into theEcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The MyoD construct used as a template for in vitrotranscription and translation was made by excision of the MyoD cDNA from pV2C11B (obtained from Sunjay Kaushal) with EcoRI and cloning into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3. The human E47 expression construct was cloned by PCR amplification withPfu polymerase of the E47 cDNA (19Peverali F.A. Ramqvist T. Saffrich R. Pepperkok R. Barone M.V. Philipson L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4291-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) with the primers 5′-CGGGATCCAGGAGAATGAACCAGCCG-3′ and 5′ -CGGAATTCGGAGGCATACCTTTCACA-3′, followed by digestion with BamHI and EcoRI. The fragment was then ligated into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pcDNA3. The point mutant of hCHF2 and the deletion mutants of hCHF2 were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of pcDNA-hCHF2 with the QuikChange kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To introduce stop signals at codons 112, 172, 232, and 292 in pcDNA-hCHF2, the primer pairs 5′-GCAGGAGGGAAAGGTTAATTTGACGCGCACGCCCTTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAAGGGCGTGCGCGTCAAATTAACCTTTCCCTCCTGC-3′, 5′-GAAGCCGCGAGCGGCGCCTAGGCGGGCCTCGGACACATTC-3′ and 5′-GAATGTGTCCGAGGCCCGCCTAGGCGCCGCTCGCGGCTTC-3′, 5′-GAGGCGCCTGCTTTCGAGCGTAACCTAGCGGCAGCCTCGGACCG-3′ and 5′-CGGTCCGAGGCTGCCGCTAGGTTACGCTCGCAAAGCAGGCGCCTC-3′, 5′-CAGGCTGCTGCAAACCTTGGCTAGCCCTATAGACCTTGG-3′and 5′-CCAAGGTCTATAGGGCTAGCCAAGGTTTGCAGCAGCCTG-3′, were used, respectively. To generate the point mutation glycine to proline at codon 55, the primer pair 5′-GCCAGAAAAAGACGGAGACCAATAATTGAGAAGCGCCGACGAGAC-3′ and 5′GTCTCGTCGGCGCTTCTCAATTATTGGTCTCCGTCTTTTTCTGGC-3′ was used. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To generate the amino-terminal deletion mutant pFLAG-CHF2(76–304), a 1.8-kbKpnI-XbaI hCHF2 cDNA fragment was excised from pcDNA-hCHF2 and cloned into the KpnI andXbaI sites of pFLAGCMV2 (Sigma). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, the FLAG-tagged CHF2 construct was generated by excision of the 2.1-kb AvaI fragment from pcDNA-hCHF2 and treatment with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I to generate blunt ends, followed by ligation to the Klenow-treated EcoRI site of pFLAGCMV2. This construct encodes amino acids 7–304 downstream of the FLAG peptide. Total RNA was prepared from cultured C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes as described (20Jain M.K. Fujita K.P. Hsieh C.M. Endege W.O.

C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in growth medium and induced to differentiate under low serum conditions as described (22Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1978; 15: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). 10T1/2 cells were cultured in basal Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated onto six-well trays 1 day prior to transfection and were transfected at 70% confluence with the indicated plasmids mixed with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Total DNA transfected per well was kept constant at 2 μg by adding vector DNA as needed. After 48 h, cells were harvested with passive lysis buffer and luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described (23Chin M.T.

In vitro transcribed and translated hCHF1, hCHF2, MyoD, and E47 were generated using the plasmids pcDNA-hCHF1, pcDNA-hCHF2, pcDNA-MyoD, and pcDNA-E47, respectively (see above). Allin vitro transcription and translation reactions were verified by SDS-PAGE. The E-box oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTTCCAACACCTGCTGCAAGCT-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGCAGCAGGTGTTGGAAGCT-3′ and the mutant E box oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTTCCAAGACCTGCTGCAAGCT-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGCAGCAGGTCTTGGAAGCT-3′ (for nonspecific competition) were annealed and labeled as described previously (23Chin M.T.

Supershift antibodies for MyoD and E2A were obtained commercially (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glass coverslips were immersed in ethanol, flame-sterilized, and placed in six-well trays. 10T1/2 cells were plated and transfected as described above. After 24 h, the culture medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum. After an additional 48 h, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% BSA for 20 min to decrease nonspecific binding. The cells were incubated next with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against skeletal myosin heavy chain (MY-32, Sigma), at 1:1000 dilution in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% BSA, for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were next washed five times in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with the fluorescent secondary antibody ALEXA 546 anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 1:200 dilution in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% BSA for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, stained with Hoechst 33258, and washed an additional two times. The coverslips were then mounted on glass slides with antifade solution (Molecular Probes). Myosin heavy chain-positive cells were detected with fluorescence microscopy, and the number of positive cells was quantified by counting the number in six consecutive 100× fields. COS7 cells were cotransfected with either pFLAG-CHF2 and pCS26MTMyoD or pFLAG-CHF2 and pCS26MT (empty vector) with FuGENE 6 as described above. After 48 h, cells were lysed in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (4 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml glycerol phosphate). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15–30 min. 2 μg of 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was added to 1 ml of clarified lysate containing 500 μg of total cellular protein and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. 25 μl of Protein G Plus-Agarose (Santa Cruz) was added and incubated for 6 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation followed by four washes in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. The pellets were then resuspended in an equal volume of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose and subjected to Western blotting with the M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) or the 9E10 anti-Myc antibody. Bands were visualized by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:4000), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance with statistical significance set at ap value of < 0.05. For reporter gene assays, all groups involving cotransfection of CHF1, CHF2, or its derivatives were compared with the MyoD-stimulated activity of the myogenin promoter in the absence of CHF1 or CHF2. For myogenic conversion assays, a similar comparison was performed. To determine whether CHF2 is regulated during myoblast to myotube differentiation, we used the well characterized C2C12 myoblast in vitrodifferentiation system (22Nadal-Ginard B.

Under conditions of low serum and high cell density, C2C12 myoblasts spontaneously fuse, show a dramatic increase in myogenin expression, and express a variety of skeletal muscle contractile proteins such as myosin heavy chain. Given the potential role of CHF2 in muscle differentiation, we examined the time course of CHF2 expression in differentiating muscle cells. As shown in Fig. 1, CHF2 mRNA is easily detectable in proliferating myoblasts. After induction of differentiation, CHF2 expression decreases to nearly undetectable levels by 3 days. Myogenin expression, in contrast, is markedly increased, peaking 3 days after differentiation was induced. These findings suggest that decreased expression of CHF2 may be required for full induction of myogenin expression. We also examined the expression of CHF1, but no signal was seen in either proliferating myoblasts or differentiated myotubes (data not shown). To test the hypothesis that CHF2 negatively regulates the myogenin promoter, we performed assays of myogenin promoter activity using a luciferase reporter after transient transfection of various regulators into 10T1/2 cells. We also tested the effect of CHF1, because of its transient expression in somites and to address functional redundancy with CHF2. As shown in Fig.2 A, cotransfection of MyoD with the myogenin promoter led to an 8.5-fold induction of reporter gene activity. When CHF1 was cotransfected with MyoD, this MyoD-induced increase in promoter activity was reduced by 65%. When CHF2 was cotransfected with MyoD, the MyoD-induced increase in promoter activity was almost completely abolished. As a control, cotransfection of an expression plasmid for the bHLH-Period ARNT-SIM domain protein ARNT had no significant effect on myogenin promoter activity. These findings suggest that CHF1 and CHF2 function as negative regulators of myogenin expression. To verify that the effect on myogenin promoter activity is dose-dependent, we transfected increasing doses of CHF1 or CHF2, keeping total DNA constant by the addition of vector DNA. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the repression of myogenin promoter activity by both CHF1 and CHF2 is dose-dependent. Binding of bHLH proteins to consensus E-box targets induces myogenin promoter activity (18Edmondson D.G. Cheng T.C. Cserjesi P. Chakraborty T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3665-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In order to determine the mechanism by which CHF1 and CHF2 inhibit myogenin promoter activation, we performed EMSAs to determine the effect of CHF1 and CHF2 on the binding of the MyoD·E47 heterodimer to the E-box binding site, as shown in Fig.3. The control lanes demonstrate that no binding activity is present in the reticulocyte lysate alone (lane 1) and that MyoD does not bind as a homodimer (lane 2), but that E47 does bind as a homodimer (lane 3). MyoD and E47 together form a heterodimer, as verified with supershift antibodies to MyoD and E47, that prevent the complexes from entering the gel (lanes 4–6). When cotranslated CHF1 or CHF2 is present, the MyoD·E47 complex is virtually abolished, and no new bands appear, which suggests that these proteins prevent formation of a DNA-binding complex (lanes 7 and 8). In contrast, cotranslation of the ARNT bHLH-Period ARNT-SIM domain protein has no effect on the MyoD·E47 complex (lane 9). To verify that this band represents a complex that binds specifically to the E-box, unlabeled E-box oligonucleotides (specific competitor) were also added to the reaction at a 20-fold molar excess and inhibited formation of the labeled complex. In contrast, a nonspecific competitor oligonucleotide containing a mutated E-box did not inhibit formation of the observed complex (lane 10). These findings suggest that the mechanism by which CHF1 and CHF2 repress MyoD-dependent activation of the myogenin promoter is inhibition of MyoD·E47 binding to the E-box. To verify that the repression of the myogenin promoter seen with reporter gene assays is biologically relevant to myogenesis, we overexpressed CHF1 and CHF2 in C2C12 myoblasts using adenovirus-mediated transfection. We infected myoblasts at a multiplicity of infection of 10 or 50 just prior to induction of differentiation. Unfortunately, the control vector expressing only green fluorescent protein was a potent inhibitor of myogenic terminal differentiation, as no cells that were both myosin heavy chain-positive and green fluorescent protein-positive could be identified (data not shown). We subsequently performed transient transfection of 10T1/2 cells with a MyoD expression plasmid and tested the effect of cotransfection of CHF1 and CHF2. As shown in Fig. 4 A, MyoD transfection results in a significant number of myosin heavy chain-positive cells. When CHF1 or CHF2 was cotransfected, virtually no myosin heavy chain-positive cells are seen. Representative microscope fields for each transfection are shown in Fig. 4 B. These results indicate that CHF1 and CHF2 can inhibit myogenesis, and are likely to play an important role in skeletal muscle differentiation. In order to elucidate further the mechanisms by which CHF2 inhibits myogenesis, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed. One potential mechanism is CHF binding and sequestering MyoD·E2A. Another potential mechanism would be by forming an inactive heterodimer with either MyoD or E2A gene products (E12 or E47). Our previous study indicated that CHF1 and CHF2 did not bind to E12 in a yeast two-hybrid assay (4Chin M.T. Maemura K. Fukumoto S. Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6381-6387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we attempted to coimmunoprecipitate MyoD and CHF2, to test the hypothesis that repression is mediated by inactive heterodimer formation. As shown in Fig. 5, immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged MyoD leads to coimmunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged CHF2 when both proteins are cotransfected. As a control, the anti-Myc antibody did not immunoprecipitate FLAG-CHF2 in the absence of Myc-MyoD. These findings suggest that the mechanism of repression involves formation of an inactive heterodimer with MyoD. In order to identify portions of the molecule that are critical for repression of myogenin promoter activity and myogenic terminal differentiation, we generated a series of mutations in CHF2. These mutations specifically target the bHLH domain and the YRPW motif. In transient transfection analysis, full-length CHF2 repressed MyoD-dependent transcription, as shown in Fig. 6. Deletion of the COOH-terminal 13 amino acids, including the YRPW motif, had no effect on transcriptional repression. Further deletion of the COOH-terminal 73 amino acids led to a sharp decrease in repressor activity. Surprisingly, deletion of the amino-terminal 75 amino acids, containing a portion of the bHLH domain, also had no effect on transcriptional repression. Mutation of the glycine at position 55 to a proline residue in CHF2 (Pro55) also did not significantly affect the ability of the protein to repress transcription, indicating that an intact bHLH domain is dispensable for transcriptional repression. To test whether these mutations also affect myogenic terminal differentiation, we transfected 10T1/2 cells, as shown in Fig.7. As expected, mutations that affect transcriptional repression also affect myogenic conversion. In summary, our findings indicate that neither the YRPW motif nor the bHLH are absolutely required for transcriptional repression or repression of myogenic terminal differentiation, and a critical domain is located between amino acids 76 and 291. Analysis of the deleted region between amino acids 231 and 291 reveals no known structural motifs, however this region is striking for its preponderance of alanine residues, which predicts a markedly hydrophobic domain by Kyte-Doolittle calculations (data not shown).Figure 7Identification of CHF2 domains required for repression of myogenic terminal differentiation.

Others have reported previously that CHF2 and its relative CHF1 are expressed during somitogenesis and in the limb buds, suggesting a potential role in regulation of myogenesis (5Nakagawa O. Nakagawa M. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Srivastava D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 6Leimeister C. Externbrink A. Klamt B. Gessler M. Mech.

Our data indicate that CHF2 represses myogenic differentiation in vitro, suggesting that it may serve a similar role during embryonic skeletal muscle development. CHF1, CHF2, and their relatives form a novel subclass of hairy-related bHLH proteins (4Chin M.T. Maemura K. Fukumoto S. Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol.

Science. 2000; 287: 1820-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Our work provides a systematic analysis of structure and function, assesses the contribution of each domain to transcriptional repression, and highlights functional divergence from other hairy-related proteins. Most hairy family members have an invariant proline within the basic region, whereas CHF1 and its relatives have glycine in place of proline. Our mutational analysis was designed to assess the importance of this glycine residue, by substituting proline for glycine to make CHF2 more like other hairy family proteins. As shown in Fig. 5, the mutation of glycine to proline does not significantly affect the ability of the protein to function as a transcriptional repressor, raising questions about the importance of this residue. In Drosophila hairy, the Orange domain, in conjunction with the bHLH domain, is thought to mediate repression of specific transcriptional activators, such as Scute (16Dawson S.R. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Parkhurst S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6923-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Our mutational analysis tested whether the CHF2 Orange domain plays a similar role in conjunction with the bHLH domain to regulate myogenesis. As shown in Fig. 5, the combination of the bHLH domain and the Orange was not sufficient to mediate repression of myogenin promoter activity. These findings indicate that the function of the Orange domain in CHF2 may not parallel the function of the homologous domain in hairy. In most hairy family members, the WRPW motif is critical for interaction with members of the groucho family of transcriptional co-repressors (17Fisher A.L. Ohsako S. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In CHF2 and its relatives, the WRPW motif is replaced by the related sequence YRPW. Our data indicate that this motif is dispensable for transcriptional repression, which suggests that an interaction with groucho-related proteins is not required for repression of myogenesis. Our mutational analysis represents the first systematic assessment of each domain identified by protein homology, and confirms that the structural divergence of CHF2 and its relatives also leads to functional divergence. At present, it is unclear whether CHF1 and CHF2 are functionally distinct, since they behave similarly in vitro (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4and data not shown). This functional overlap is surprising, given their very different expression patterns. Targeted disruption of each gene in mice will determine their contribution to muscle development and shed insight into their functional divergence. Distinction of functionin vivo will further be enhanced by knock-in of each cDNA into the locus of the other. These studies are ongoing. The myogenic bHLH factors are among the most powerful tissue-restricted transcription factors, by virtue of their ability to activate a muscle-specific transcriptional program in a variety of cell types. A number of myogenic repressors have previously been identified (10Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar, 11Lu J. Webb R. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1996; 86: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Negative regulators of the myogenic program are hypothesized to play important roles in preventing the expression of a myogenic program in inappropriate embryonic tissues or at inappropriate times during development. The mechanisms by which they repress the activity of myogenic bHLH factors include formation of heterodimers that do not bind DNA (10Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar, 12Chen C.M. Kraut N. Groudine M. Weintraub H. Cell. 1996; 86: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), by masking their nuclear localization signal (12Chen C.M. Kraut N. Groudine M. Weintraub H. Cell. 1996; 86: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and by formation of heterodimers that bind DNA but are transcriptionally inactive (11Lu J. Webb R. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Of the hairy family members studied, HES-1 has been shown to inhibit in vitro myogenesis by inhibition of DNA binding (13Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that CHF2 functions similarly to HES-1 by inhibiting binding of the MyoD·E2A heterodimer to DNA. Furthermore, we show that CHF2 forms a heterodimer with MyoD that does not bind to the E-box, in a manner analogous to the Id protein (10Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar). It remains possible that the CHF2·MyoD complex may bind to an as yet undetermined DNA sequence, and this hypothesis is under active investigation. The regulation of myogenic bHLH protein function and myogenic differentiation in general is highly complex. The MADS box protein MEF2C has been shown to activate the myogenin promoter and also interacts directly with myogenic bHLH proteins to synergistically activate muscle-specific genes (18Edmondson D.G. Cheng T.C. Cserjesi P. Chakraborty T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3665-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 24Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The bHLH factor Twist has been shown to function as a negative regulator of myogenesis through interactions with both myogenic bHLH proteins and MEF2C (25Spicer D.B. Rhee J. Cheung W.L. Lassar A.B. Science. 1996; 272: 1476-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of the myogenic program is enhanced by the transcriptional coactivator p300 (26Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The function of CHF2 within this regulatory network is currently under study. Our previous work describing the cloning of CHF1 and CHF2 demonstrated that CHF1 functions as a transcriptional repressor and may control the timing of terminal differentiation in ventricular cardiac myocytes (4Chin M.T. Maemura K. Fukumoto S. Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6381-6387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), by virtue of its expression in the developing but not mature ventricle. Our current work indicates that CHF2 is likely to play an important role in controlling the timing of terminal differentiation of skeletal muscle. Interestingly, CHF1 expression persists in adult aortic smooth muscle cells (4Chin M.T. Maemura K. Fukumoto S. Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6381-6387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which are neither striated nor terminally differentiated. It is tempting to speculate that CHF1 and CHF2 may function in general as molecular regulators of terminal differentiation in muscle tissue, where persistent expression leads to a proliferative, non-terminally differentiated phenotype. This hypothesis is subject to ongoing investigation. We are grateful to Sunjay Kaushal for the MyoD expression plasmid pV2C11B."

Genome analysis and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to clone the full-length cDNA from a mouse mastocytoma cell line. The extended cDNA encodes for an additional 174 amino acids at the amino terminus of the protein. The murine sequence is 95% identical to the human epimerase identified from genomic sequences and fits with the general size and structure of the gene from Drosophila melanogasterand Caenorhabditis elegans.

An assay with increased sensitivity was devised that detects enzyme activity in extracts prepared from cultured cells and in recombinant proteins.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29923-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To a large extent, these biological activities depend on the heparan sulfate chains attached to the core protein. Heparan sulfate, a type of glycosaminoglycan, initially assembles by the copolymerization of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and d-glucuronic acid (GlcA). The backbone then undergoes extensive modification initiated by theN-deacetylation and N-sulfation of subsets of GlcNAc residues. Subsequently, d-GlcA residues adjacent to the N-sulfated sugars are converted tol-IdoUA1 by a C5-epimerase and are sulfated at C-2 by a specific sulfotransferase. The glucosamine units also can be sulfated at C-6 and to a lesser extent at C-3. The blocklike arrangement of the modified residues confers specific binding properties to the chains for protein ligands, which in turn facilitate various biological activities. Many of the enzymes involved in heparan sulfate and heparin formation seem to be members of multienzyme gene families. Two exceptions are the C5-epimerase that interconverts d-GlcA andl-IdoUA and the 2-O-sulfotransferase that adds sulfate to C-2 of IdoUA residues and to a lesser extent GlcA residues. The C5-epimerase has been partially purified from mouse mastocytoma (4Malmström A. Rodén L. Feingold D.S. Jacobsson I. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

Kinetic studies have clarified the substrate specificity of the epimerase, showing that the enzyme will react with both d-GlcA (forward reaction) andl-IdoUA (reverse reaction) when these residues are located toward the reducing side of N-sulfated glucosamine residues, but it will not react with uronic acids that are O-sulfated or that are adjacent to O-sulfated glucosamine residues (7Jacobsson I. Bäckström G. Höök M. Lindahl U. Feingold D.S. Malmström A. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2975-2982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,8Jacobsson I. Lindahl U. Jensen J.W.

This specificity is consistent with the overall order of modification, suggesting that epimerization begins to occur after GlcNAc N-deacetylation and N-sulfation but before glucosamine residues undergo 6-O-sulfation and 3-O-sulfation (7Jacobsson I. Bäckström G. Höök M. Lindahl U. Feingold D.S. Malmström A. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2975-2982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lindahl U. Jacobsson I. Höök M.

The fact that the epimerase seems to be represented only once in vertebrate and invertebrate genomes suggests that the extent of uronic acid epimerization depends on the level of enzyme expression and production of the N-sulfated tracts. In an attempt to study the cellular localization and potential interaction of the epimerase with other enzymes in the pathway, we discovered that the published bovine sequence encodes a truncated protein. 2M.

This report provides the full-length sequence from mouse and human, an improved set of conditions for assaying the epimerase in cell extracts, and a demonstration that the enzyme is localized to the Golgi in vertebrate cells. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL-61, Manassa, VA). MST cells were derived from the Furth murine mastocytoma (10Montgomery R.I. Lidholt K. Flay N.W. Liang J. Vertel B. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11327-11331Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), and MST cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium. Both media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 units/ml penicillin G. The cells were cultured at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 100% relative humidity. A murine epimerase cDNA fragment corresponding to the published bovine sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF003927) was cloned from an MST cDNA library using PCR, the forward primer 5′-ATGTCCTTTGAAGGCTACAATGTGG-3′, and the reverse primer 5′-CTAGTTGTGCTTTGCCCGGCTGCC-3′, which anneal with the first and last 24 bases of the partial bovine sequence (6Li J.P.

The PCR product was blunt-end cloned into pGEM (Promega) for sequencing. Subsequently, the primers XhoEpi5′ (5′-CCCCGGCTCGAGGCCGCCATGTCCTTTGAAGCCTACAATG-3′) and BamEpi3′ (5′-CTGGATCCTAGTTGTGCTTTGCCCGG-3′) were used to amplify the cDNA from the pGEM epimerase clone for transfer into pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) using the XhoI and BamHI sites. To generate the YFP-tagged truncated epimerase, the primers XhoEpi5′ and 3′Epi-GFPBam (5′-CTGGATCCCCGTTGTGCTTTGCCCGG-3′) were used to amplify the epimerase cDNA, which was cloned into the XhoI andBamHI sites of pEYFP-N1. The cDNA containing the full-length epimerase was cloned using a primer designed to the proposed 5′ end deduced from the human genomic DNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number AC026992). This primer, 5EpiXhoI (5′-CTCGAGCCATGCGTTGCTTGGCAGCTCGG-3′), was used with an internal reverse primer, 3EpiBam (5′-GGATCCGAGATTCCATGCCGCGCTCGTACAAG-3′), to amplify the 5′ 900 base pairs of the cDNA from the murine MST cDNA library. The cDNA encoding the full-length epimerase was then constructed by digesting the truncated epimerase in pCDNA3.1 with XhoI and HindIII and then by inserting the extended 5′ end amplified by PCR. The GFP-tagged full-length epimerase was generated by amplifying the full coding region from pCDNA3.1 with the primers 5EpiXhoI and 3′Epi-GFPBam and by cloning into the XhoI andBamHI sites of pEGFP-N1. The coding sequence was verified by directly sequencing PCR products from three independent amplifications from the MST cDNA library. All PCR amplifications were done using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and clones were sequenced on an ABI 373 DNA sequencer using dye terminator cycle sequencing. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH) with mRNA isolated from MST cells. Two gene-specific primers were used based on the murine sequence for the epimerase described above, 3EpiBam (5′-GGATCCGAGATTCCATGCCGCGCTCGTACAAG-3′) and BC15 (5′-ACATTGGTGGATCTAGACTT-3′). Analysis of five independent clones, each with the same 5′ end, yielded a consensus sequence. The sequence of the 3′ end of the murine coding sequence was determined by amplifying the 3′ end from an MST cDNA library using BC11 (5′-GGAGACCACAGAAAAGAATC-3′) and BC42 (5′-GGAGACCACAGAAAAGAATC-3′). BC11 was designed to anneal between nucleotides 1164 and 1183 of the mouse epimerase cDNA, whereas BC42 was designed to anneal to the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) and was designed based on nucleotides 1832–1855 of the partial human sequence (GenBankTMaccession number AB020643). The PCR product was cloned, and three independent isolates were sequenced. All three clones contained two silent changes from the published human sequence. The GenBankTM accession numbers for the murine cDNA and encoded protein are AF325532 and AAG42004, respectively. Epimerase constructs were generated with COOH-terminal c-myc and GFP tags by subcloning into pCDNA3.1 containing myc/His6 and pEGFP (CLONTECH), respectively. An amino-terminal c-myc-tagged clone was generated by annealing the oligonucleotides BC46 (5′-ATGTCTAGAGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGTCTAGAGCA-3′) and BC47 (5′-TGCTCTAGACAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCTCTAGACAT-3′), which codes for a myc tag. The oligonucleotides were boiled for 1 min, cooled on ice, phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), and cloned in-frame into theEcoRV site in the polylinker region of pcDNA3.1 containing the full-length epimerase. The clone used in these experiments actually contained two Myc tags in a tandem repeat at the amino terminus. CHO cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's directions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown on 24-well glass microscope slides and were processed for enzyme localization studies 24–36 h after transfection. After the cells were fixed for 1 h with 2% paraformaldehyde in 75 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, they were rinsed several times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (11Dulbecco R. Vogt M. J. Exp. Med. 1954; 99: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2004) Google Scholar). Cells were then permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 (v/v) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (w/v) in PBS. The primary antibody, mouse anti-Myc (Invitrogen) monoclonal antibody, and rabbit polyclonal anti-α-mannosidase II antiserum (a gift from Marilyn G. Farquhar, University of California, San Diego) were diluted 1:400 in PBS with 1% BSA and incubated for 1 h with the fixed cells. To remove the unbound primary antibody, the cells were washed several times for 30 min with PBS containing 0.1% BSA. The samples were then incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody, anti-rabbit Cy5 (Qccuvate Chemicals, NY) or anti-mouse-TRITC (Sigma), diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 1% BSA. After several washes, the cells were mounted with Vectashield containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for nuclear staining (Vector Laboratories). The photomicrographs shown in Fig. 5,A–D, were captured with a Photometrics charge-coupled device mounted on a Nikon microscope adapted to a DeltaVision (Applied Precision, Inc.) deconvolution imaging system. The data sets were deconvolved and analyzed using SoftWorx software (Applied Precision, Inc.) on a Silicon Graphics Octane work station. The photomicrograph shown in Fig. 5 E was captured with a Hamamatsu C5810 three-color chilled charge-coupled device camera mounted on a Zeiss Axiophot (×100 lens) microscope. Normal and transfected cells were washed twice with cold PBS and once with cold 0.25 m sucrose in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and were then scraped with a rubber policeman into 100 μl of cold buffer containing 0.25 msucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin. Cells were lysed by sonication with a microtip sonicator, and the protein concentration was quantitated with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as the standard. The extracts were stable when stored at −20 °C. The epimerase substrate consisted of modifiedN-acetylheparosan and was prepared as described (12Hagner-McWhirter Å. Hannesson H.H. Campbell P. Westley J. Rodén L. Lindahl U. Li J.P. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli K5 capsular polysaccharide was labeled in vivo withd-[5-3H]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and purified from the growth medium. The GlcNAc residues in the labeled polysaccharide were N-deacetylated to near completion with anhydrous hydrazine and hydrazine sulfate (Sigma) and wereN-sulfated with trimethylamine sulfur trioxide complex (Sigma). The concentration of N-acetylheparosan was determined by a carbazol assay for uronic acids (13Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5217) Google Scholar), which yielded a radiospecific activity of 76 cpm/pmol GlcA (43 Ci/mol). Detection of epimerase activity was based on the release of3H from [5-3H]GlcA units in the polysaccharide and recovery as 3H2O (12Hagner-McWhirter Å. Hannesson H.H. Campbell P. Westley J. Rodén L. Lindahl U. Li J.P. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Initial assays were set up according to the published reaction conditions (“original”), which contained 50 mm HEPES, 15 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, and 0.015% Triton X-100, pH 7.4 (12Hagner-McWhirter Å. Hannesson H.H. Campbell P. Westley J. Rodén L. Lindahl U. Li J.P. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein, substrate, and various ancillary factors were adjusted to maximize the activity detected in normal and transfected cells. The “revised” assay consisted of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 300 pmol of3H-sulfated heparosan substrate, and 2 μg of cell protein in a total volume of 20 μl. Some assays contained 40 mmCaCl2, but divalent cations were later found not to be required. The reactions were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and halted by the addition of 50 μl of cold 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 50 mm LiCl. The sample and a 100-μl rinse of the tube with buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 0.1% Triton X-100) were transferred to a 0.4-ml column of DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 0.9 ml of assay buffer, and the 3H2O recovered in the flow-through fractions was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry using Ultima Gold (Packard Instrument Co.). A reagent blank containing everything except a source of enzyme was included as a control. This yielded values of ∼200 cpm, which were subtracted from the experimental values that ranged from 300 to 3000 counts. All assays were done in duplicate with comparable results from three or more independent experiments. Cells were harvested, and 25 μg of protein for each sample was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% gel. The samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the Bio-Rad Mini Protean II system. The membrane was blocked at 4 °C overnight with 4% BSA in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl) with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). Mouse anti-GFP (CLONTECH) and mouse anti-Myc (Invitrogen) were diluted 1:1000 and 1:5000 in TBST, respectively, and incubated for 1 h with the membrane at room temperature with shaking. The membrane was washed three times with TBST before the application of the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:3000 in TBST. The membrane was washed six times with TBST and developed with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The GlcA C5-epimerase was previously purified from murine mastocytoma and bovine liver (4Malmström A. Rodén L. Feingold D.S. Jacobsson I. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3878-3883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Campbell P. Hannesson H.H. Sandbäck D. Rodén L. Lindahl U. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing the purified protein yielded proline as the amino-terminal amino acid, suggesting that the protein had been proteolytically cleaved during the purification process (6Li J.P. Hagner-McWhirter Å. Kjellén L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28158-28163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Several internal peptides also were generated by controlled proteolysis, and the peptide sequences were used to design oligonucleotides for screening a bovine lung cDNA library. A cDNA sequence was obtained that was 3085 base pairs and contained an open reading frame corresponding to a 444-amino acid protein from the first in-frame ATG codon. The deduced amino acid sequence predicted a 49,905-Da protein with a potential transmembrane domain located near the amino terminus. Expression of this clone in the baculovirus system yielded the expected activity (6Li J.P. Hagner-McWhirter Å. Kjellén L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28158-28163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the epimerase sequence suggested that it was incomplete. First, computer-aided analysis using PSORT did not indicate the predicted transmembrane domain and in fact suggested that the protein was most likely soluble (14Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). As described below, this was confirmed in localization studies with GFP-tagged constructs. Second, alignment of the published bovine epimerase sequence with other orthologs in the GenBankTM data base suggested that the bovine sequence was potentially missing a large domain from the amino terminus (Fig. 1). A BLAST search revealed a human genomic DNA clone (GenBankTM accession number AC026992) containing an extended open reading frame that more closely matched the size of the epimerase orthologs found inCaenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, a partial human cDNA also was identified in the sequence data bases (GenBankTM accession number AB020643). Based on this information, we cloned an extended cDNA from mouse mastocytoma mRNA using primers based on the human sequence. This fragment was further extended using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The additional sequence added 753 nucleotides including 231 nucleotides in a 5′-UTR and 522 coding nucleotides. The 5′-UTR contains an in-frame termination codon (TGA) 21 base pairs upstream of the new initiation codon, suggesting that the cDNA encodes the full-length epimerase (Fig. 2). The context of the new start codon conforms to an “adequate” Kozak sequence (AATatgC, consensus RNNatgY, where R = A or G and Y = T or C) (15Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), whereas the previously suggested start codon lacks A or G at −3 (tttatgt). Previous studies reported a 3′-UTR sequence of ∼1.6 kilobases (6Li J.P. Hagner-McWhirter Å. Kjellén L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28158-28163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because the mRNA was found to be ∼5 kilobases, an additional untranslated sequence of ∼1.4 kilobases apparently exists, but its location is unknown. The revised sequence adds 174 amino acids to the amino terminus of the previous sequence of the bovine epimerase for a total of 618 amino acids. The full-length epimerase predicts a protein of 70,099 Da with a relatively basic isoelectric point (pI = 8.95). The protein contains a stretch of 17 hydrophobic residues located 11 amino acids from the amino terminus. As expected, PSORT predicts this as a transmembrane domain, and therefore the protein would most likely have a type II transmembrane topology like other enzymes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis. The full-length clone contains three potential N-linked glycosylation sites at residues 225, 304, and 394, consistent with previous studies suggesting that the protein contained one or more Asn-linked chains. Using the extended sequence to perform a BLAST search of the GenBankTM data bases did not reveal additional homologs, suggesting that there may be only one heparin/heparan sulfate C5-epimerase (16Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60174) Google Scholar). A comparison of C. elegans, D. melanogaster, mouse, bovine, and human epimerase sequences indicated weak homology in the amino-terminal domain (residues 1–171) followed by a region of high identity (62%, residues 172–223). However, neither of these regions seems critical for catalytic activity because the purified protein from bovine liver was truncated at residue 248 (6Li J.P. Hagner-McWhirter Å. Kjellén L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28158-28163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domain was also highly conserved across phylogeny (60% identity, residues 497–618), suggesting that this may represent an important functional part of the protein. Expression studies of the truncated and full-length epimerase were undertaken to determine whether the additional 174 amino acids had any effect on catalysis. Initial attempts to assay the basal enzyme activity in cell extracts prepared from CHO and MST cells met with limited success. Expression of the truncated or full-length enzyme gave variable results, suggesting that the assay originally described for the bovine enzyme might not be optimal for cultured cells or recombinant enzymes expressed in cultured cells (4Malmström A.

Lindahl U. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Variation of each component improved the activity additively. Monovalent salts were inhibitory in contrast to previous findings (Fig.3 A) (5Campbell P. Hannesson H.H. Sandbäck D. Rodén L. Lindahl U. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Jacobsson I. Bäckström G. Höök M. Lindahl U. Feingold D.S. Malmström A. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2975-2982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Divalent cations, such as Ca2+ or Mg2+, and EDTA (up to 40 mm) had no effect (4Malmström A. Rodén L. Feingold D.S. Jacobsson I. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3878-3883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Jacobsson I. Bäckström G. Höök M. Lindahl U. Feingold D.S. Malmström A. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2975-2982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity was highly dependent on detergent, even in sonicated extracts, with maximal effects obtained with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 3 B). However, other detergents inhibited the reaction, suggesting that the effect was not merely because of solubilization of the protein from membranes. The pH optimum was ∼7.0, which is in general agreement with previous findings (Fig.3 C) (4Malmström A. Rodén L. Feingold D.S. Jacobsson I. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3878-3883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Campbell P. Hannesson H.H. Sandbäck D. Rodén L. Lindahl U. Li J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1979; 254: 2975-2982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the activity showed marked sensitivity to the type of buffer (Fig. 3 D). HEPES was found to be optimal. Under the revised conditions, the reaction was proportional with time for over 2 h and with protein concentration in the range of 1–30 μg. The K m of the enzyme for theN-deacetylated/N-sulfated heparosan was estimated to be 25 μm GlcA equivalents (∼500 pmol of GlcA/assay). With 300 pmol of GlcA/assay, a 4.5-fold increase in epimerase activity in MST cell extracts and a 6.5-fold enhancement in CHO cell extracts were observed compared with the original conditions (Fig.3 E). At lower concentrations of substrate, the difference was even more dramatic (data not shown). Transient transfection of CHO cells revealed 4-fold greater activity associated with the full-length protein compared with the truncated enzyme in the revised assay (Fig. 4). Increasing the substrate 10-fold did not enhance the rate of reaction for either recombinant enzyme (data not shown). These findings indicated that the natural amino terminus was not a prerequisite to detect activity, which is consistent with previous findings showing that the truncated protein purified from liver and mastocytoma had substantial activity (4Malmström A. Rodén L. Feingold D.S. Jacobsson I. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3878-3883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Campbell P. Hannesson H.H. Sandbäck D. Rodén L.

Extracts prepared from cells transfected with epimerase containing a COOH-terminal GFP or YFP tag were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody. As shown in the inset of Fig. 4, the tagged full-length protein was present at higher levels than the truncated enzyme. Both forms were engineered into a near perfect Kozak sequence in the expression vector, suggesting that their expression was similar. Thus, we believe that the lower amount of the truncated enzyme was caused by decreased stability. As shown below, the truncated enzyme was also mislocalized, which may add to its instability. Thus, the amino-terminal domain does not seem to enhance the intrinsic activity of the enzyme. Fusing c-myc or GFP to the COOH terminus resulted in a dramatic reduction of enzyme activity (<1 pmol/min/mg), but when a c-myc tag was placed at the amino terminus, enzyme activity was normal (23 pmol/min/mg versus 26 pmol/min/mg, respectively). These findings suggested that the highly conserved COOH terminus plays an important role in binding, conformation, or catalysis. Recent investigations into the catalytic mechanism of the C5-epimerase implicated two polyprotic bases in the proton exchanges at C-5 (17Hagner-McWhirter Å. Lindahl U. Li J.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 69-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that are possibly mediated by two lysine residues. Interestingly, two lysine residues (amino acids 547 and 616) in the COOH-terminal domain of the epimerase are highly conserved across phylogeny (Fig. 1, asterisks). Adding GFP to the COOH terminus of other enzymes involved in heparin/heparan sulfate biosynthesis does not result in loss of activity (18McCormick C. Duncan G. Goutsos K.T. Tufaro F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar).2 To study the intracellular localization of epimerase, cDNAs encoding the truncated and full-length enzymes were fused to GFP or c-mycand expressed in CHO cells. Full-length epimerase was located in a juxtanuclear position, co-localizing with the Golgi marker, α-mannosidase II (Fig. 5,A–C). This localization was observed with tags on either the C or amino terminus, indicating that the location of the tag did not interfere with subcellular localization signals in the protein (Fig. 5 E). When the truncated epimerase was expressed, it behaved as a soluble protein exhibiting diffuse cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 5 D). This is not an unexpected result given that the protein lacks a signal peptide. The mislocalization of the truncated enzyme may act to destabilize its structure and activity (Fig. 4, inset). Future studies of the epimerase will be greatly expedited by having the full-length sequence. Interestingly, very little information is available about the function of IdoUA in the biological activity of heparin and heparan sulfate. In general, it is assumed that the greater conformational flexibility of IdoUA will enhance the binding opportunities for heparin and heparan sulfate (19Mulloy B. Forster M.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The best studied example is the interaction of antithrombin with a heparin pentasaccharide, in which a critical IdoUA residue located to the reducing side of a central 3-O-sulfated glucosomine unit confers high affinity binding to antithrombin (20Atha D.H. Lormeau J.C. Petitou M. Rosenberg R.D. Choay J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6723-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Fibroblast growth factor-2 also apparently requires at least one IdoUA unit for binding and activation (21Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the former case, the addition of the 2-O-sulfate group to the IdoUA residue seems to be dispensable (20Atha D.H. Lormeau J.C. Petitou M. Rosenberg R.D. Choay J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6723-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 23Bjork I. Lindahl U. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 48: 161-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), whereas in the latter it is essential for binding (24Bai X.M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 25Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. Von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L.

Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that in some cases the IdoUA may play a direct role in binding to the ligand, whereas in others it may simply serve as a scaffold for placement of a critical sulfate residue. In both cases, the epimerase plays an essential role in creating the preferred binding site for the ligand. With full-length recombinant enzyme now available, it should be possible to engineer binding sites in isolated oligosaccharides and to explore the function of epimerasein vivo by creating mutants in cells and model organisms.

https://openalex.org/W1971959671,"One of the most definitive examples of a vertebrate extraorganismal structural protein can be found in three-spined sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>). In the breeding male the kidney hypertrophies and synthesizes an adhesive protein called ""spiggin,"" which is secreted into the urinary bladder from where it is employed as a structural thread for nest building. This paper describes the first molecular characterization of spiggin and demonstrates that this adhesive is a protein complex assembled from a potential of three distinct subunits (α, β, and γ). These subunits arise by alternative splicing, and 11-ketoandrogens induce their expression in stickleback kidneys. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of each subunit reveals a modular organization whose structural elements display a similarity to the multimerization domains found within von Willebrand Factor-related proteins. These results implicate that spiggin utilizes a conserved multimerization mechanism for the formation of a viscous agglutinate from its constituent subunits in the urinary bladders of male sticklebacks. This novel extraorganismal structural protein is therefore ideally suited to its function as an adhesive thread.AF323732AF323733AF323734"
https://openalex.org/W2076438776,"Abstract The role of interferon (IFN)-γ as a sensitizing agent in apoptosis induced by ligation of death receptors has been evaluated in human myeloid leukemia cells. Incubation of U937 cells with IFN-γ sensitized these cells to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α, agonistic CD95 antibody, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Other human myeloid leukemic cells were also sensitized by IFN-γ to death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Treatment of U937 cells with IFN-γ up-regulated the expression of caspase-8 and potently synergized with death receptor ligation in the processing of caspase-8 and BID cleavage. Concomitantly, a marked down-regulation of BCL-2 protein was also observed in cells incubated with IFN-γ. Furthermore, the caspase-dependent generation of a 23-kDa fragment of BCL-2 protein, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and the activation of caspase-9 were also enhanced upon death receptor ligation in IFN-γ-treated cells. Ectopically expressed Bcl-2 protein inhibited IFN-γ-induced sensitization to apoptosis. In summary, these results indicate that IFN-γ sensitizes human myeloid leukemic cells to a death receptor-induced, mitochondria-mediated pathway of apoptosis."

Xenopus oocytes have long served as a model system for studying Cl(Ca) channels because these channels are the predominant channel type natively expressed in this cell and because they are expressed at extremely high levels (0.5 mA/cm2) (5Dascal N. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 317-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Recently, we have been investigating the mechanisms of anion permeation (6Qu Z. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen.

Cross N.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Xenopus oocyte Cl(Ca) channels have many features in common with Cl(Ca) channels in epithelial cells, cardiac myocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells (see references in Ref. 6Qu Z. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 825-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and we think that elucidating the mechanisms of operation of Xenopusoocyte channels will provide important insights into the function of these channels in other tissues. The roles of Cl(Ca) channels in human disease are not yet firmly established. However, there are reasons to think that they may be involved in diseases as diverse as cystic fibrosis and cardiac arrhythmias. For example, there appears to be a reciprocal relationship between the level of expression of CFTR and Cl(Ca) channels in airway epithelial cells. Cells from the airway of cystic fibrosis patients can secrete in response to elevations of intracellular Ca2+(13Boucher R.C. Cheng E.H.C. Paradiso A.M. Stutts M.J. Knowles M.R. Earp H.S. J. Clin.

Physiol. 1989; 256: C226-C233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and ICl(Ca) is up-regulated in the airway of CFTR knockout mice (15Clarke L.L. Grubb B.R. Yankaskas J.R. Cotton C.U. McKenzie A. Boucher R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The up-regulation ofICl(Ca) in the airway of CFTR knockout mice can apparently compensate for the lack of CFTR and ameliorate the lung pathology in this mouse model (16Grubb B.R. Vick R.N. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1478-C1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of CFTR in cultured airway epithelial cells from cystic fibrosis patients results in a decrease in Cl(Ca) current (17Johnson L.G. Boyles S.E. Wilson J. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In the heart, the transient outward current (Ito), which plays an important role in repolarization of the cardiac action potential, is composed of several components, one of which (Ito2) is mediated by Cl(Ca) channels (18Hiraoka M. Kawano S. J. Physiol. 1989; 410: 187-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 19Zygmunt A.C. Robitelle D.C. Eddlestone G.T. Am. J.

Changes in Ito2 can alter cardiac rhythmicity by affecting action potential duration (19Zygmunt A.C. Robitelle D.C. Eddlestone G.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1096-H1106PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kawano S. Hiraoka M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1991; 23: 681-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that dogs that are genetically prone to cardiac sudden death have an abnormal Ito (22Freeman L.C. Pacioretty L.M. Moise N.S. Kass R.S. Gilmour Jr., R.E. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1997; 8: 872-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), implying that Cl(Ca) channels play a role in sudden cardiac death. Cl(Ca) channels also contribute to the arrhythmogenic transient inward current (Iti) in some species (22Freeman L.C. Pacioretty L.M. Moise N.S. Kass R.S. Gilmour Jr., R.E. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1997; 8: 872-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Zygmunt A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1984-H1995PubMed Google Scholar, 24Zygmunt A.C. Goodrow R.J. Weigel C.M. Am. J.

During Ca2+ overload, Iti can trigger oscillatory afterpotentials resulting in serious cardiac arrhythmias (26Hiraoka M. Kawano S. Hirano Y. Furukawa T. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 40: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27January C.T. Fozzard H.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1988; 40: 219-227PubMed Google Scholar). Cl− channels clearly can participate in arrhythmogenesis, because anion substitution or pharmacologic Cl− channel blockade protects against reperfusion and ischemia-induced arrhythmias (28Curtis M.J. Garlick P.B. Ridley P.D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1993; 25: 417-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 29Ridley P.D. Curtis M.J. Circ.

Understanding the nature of the pore of this channel is an important step in elucidating how ions permeate anion-selective channels in general and also in developing reagents that can be used to block or activate these channels. In our previous study (6Qu Z. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 825-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we concluded that the pore of the Cl(Ca) channel must be at least 0.74 nm in one dimension, because the pseudo-halide anion C(CN)3, which is 0.33 × 0.75 nm in its smallest cross section, is permeant through the channel. In the present study (6Qu Z. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 825-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we have examined the voltage dependence and sidedness of block of several classical Cl−channel blockers and have related these to the molecular size and structure of the blocking molecules. These studies provide insights into the functional geometry of the permeation pathway of this channel. Stage V–VI oocytes were harvested from adult Xenopus laevis females (Xenopus I) as described by Dascal (5Dascal N. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 317-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Xenopuswere anesthetized by immersion in tricaine (1.5 g/liter). Ovarian follicles were removed, cut into small pieces, and digested in normal Ringer's solution with no added calcium containing about 2 mg/ml collagenase type IA (Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature. The oocytes were extensively rinsed with normal Ringer's, placed in L-15 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), and stored at 18 °C. Oocytes were used 1–6 days after isolation. For excised patch experiments, oocytes were placed in a hypertonic solution (200 mm potassium aspartate, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 with KOH) for 1–10 min to facilitate manual removal of the vitelline membrane, and then they were placed in a standard solution (see “Solutions” below) until use. Recordings were performed using the inside-out and outside-out excised patch configurations of patch clamp technique. Pipettes were made of borosilicate glass (Sutter Instrument Co.), pulled by a Sutter P-2000 puller, and fire-polished. Patch pipettes had resistances of 6–10 megohms. Unless noted, they were filled with a standard solution (see “Solutions”), which was always the same as the solution in the bath. The bath was grounded via a 3-M KCl-agarose bridge connected to a Ag-AgCl reference electrode. Solution changes were performed by positioning the patch at the end of a battery of sewer pipes having 100-μm internal diameter connected to the gravity feed solution containers. Patches were usually obtained from the animal hemisphere of oocytes, because Cl(Ca) channels are concentrated here (9Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1286-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The patch was typically held at 0 mV, and current was measured in response to a 200-ms voltage ramp from −100 to +100 mV. Patch clamp data were acquired by an Axopatch 200A amplifier controlled either by Clampex 8.1 via a Digidata 1322A analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converter (Axon Instruments) or by Curcap 3.0 and a Challenger DB voltage stimulator (W. Goolsby, Emory University). Symmetrical solutions containing ∼150 mm Cl− were used. In different experiments, the cation was either Na+ or NMDG, as indicated in the figure legends. Na+ was always used in experiments with 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS) because of possible interaction of DIDS and NMDG. The NMDG standard solution contained 150 mm NMDG-Cl, 10 mm NMDG-HEPES, 4 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3. Zero Ca2+solution contained 10 mm EGTA. High Ca2+solution contained 10 mm EGTA titrated with Ca2+ to give ∼50 μm free Ca2+. The standard Na+-containing solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Zero Ca2+ solution contained 10 mm EGTA, and the high Ca2+ solution contained 0.1 mmCaCl2 with no added EGTA. With inside-out patches, to be certain that the currents recorded were Ca2+-dependent, we always measured the current in a zero Ca2+ solution at the start and end of the experiment. If the Ca2+-independent current was >5% of the total current in Ca2+, the patch was discarded. For outside-out patches, it was not practical to change the Ca2+ bathing the cytosolic face. Therefore, with outside-out patches, the identity of the current as a Cl−current was verified at the start and end of an experiment by bathing the external face of the patch in solution in which all Cl− was replaced with SO4−. Patches were not analyzed if the outward current under these conditions was >5% of the current with symmetrical Cl−. Diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (DPC) and niflumic acid (NFA) were from Sigma; anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (A9C) was from Aldrich; DIDS was from Molecular Probes. DIDS from Sigma and Molecular Probes differed significantly in their color, and some preliminary experiments with Sigma DIDS yielded irreproducible results. DIDS (Molecular Probes) was suspended in water at 0.3m as a stock before working solutions were made. Other compounds were dissolved in Me2SO at 0.3m as stocks to keep the [Me2SO] in working solutions < 0.1%. For the calculations and graphical presentation, we used Origin 6.0 software (Microcal). Curve fitting was performed using the iterative algorithms in Origin. Results are presented as means ± S.E., and n refers to the number of patches in each experiments. The equilibrium geometries of the blockers used were calculated using both MMFF94 molecular mechanics models and Hartree-Fock molecular orbital calculations with the 3–21G* basis set (31Hehre W.J., Yu, J. Klunzinger P.E. Lou L. A Brief Guide to Molecular Mechanics and Quantum Chemical Calculations. Wavefunction Inc., Irvine, CA1998Google Scholar). Calculations were performed using PC Spartan Pro software (Wavefunction, Inc., Irvine, CA) run on an Intel Pentium-III-based PC running Windows 2000. To determine the minimal cross-sectional dimensions of the molecule, the molecule was rotated manually to fit it into the smallest possible rectangle. The center-to-center atomic distances were measured using utilities in PC Spartan Pro; the molecular dimensions were calculated by adding the van der Waals radii of the terminal atoms to the measured center-to-center distances. In the cases of C(CN)3 and A9C, the geometries were confirmed by comparison to crystal structure data available in the Cambridge Crystallographic Database. The goal of these experiments was to characterize the inhibition of Ca2+-activated Cl− channels by various Cl− channel blockers. Excised patches in either inside-out or outside-out configurations were pulled from stage VIXenopus oocytes. The solutions on the inside and outside of the patch were always the same, except that 0.1 mmCaCl2 was added to the cytosolic face to activate Cl(Ca) channels. The effects of the blockers applied to either the cytosolic face of the membrane in inside-out patches or the extracellular face in outside-out patches were then determined. Fig.1 A showsI-V curves of ICl(Ca) in an outside-out excised patch from Xenopus oocytes recorded with symmetrical 150 mm Cl− solutions. TheI-V curve in the absence of A9C was approximately linear (Fig. 1 A). The current was a Cl−current, because the outward current was completely blocked by replacement of extracellular Cl− by impermeant anions such as SO4−, and replacing Na+with NMDG had little effect on Erev (data not shown, but see Ref. 6Qu Z. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 825-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The outward current was blocked in a concentration- and voltage-dependent manner by addition of A9C to the extracellular face of the membrane (Fig. 1 A). The inward current was only slightly affected. In Fig. 1 B, the currents from Fig. 1 A were expressed as a fraction of the current in the absence of A9C (I/IA9C = 0) and plotted as a function of voltage. Relative current amplitude decreased with depolarization, confirming that inhibition of Cl− current by A9C was voltage-dependent. The data in Fig. 1 B were replotted in Fig. 1 C for each voltage as a function of [A9C]. These data were fitted to an equation of the formI/IA9C=0=Imin+(Imax−Imin)/{1+([A9C]/Ki)n},Equation 1 where Imax and Iminare the maximum and minimum current amplitudes, Kiis the concentration of A9C required to reduce the current amplitude to (Imax + Imin)/2, andn is the slope factor. Ki was determined for each potential and plotted in Fig. 1 D. The apparentKi decreased ∼10-fold per 100-mV depolarization. The Ki at 0 mV was estimated to be 158 μm, and the Ki at +100 mV was 18.3 μm. From Fig. 1 D, one can estimate the fraction of the voltage field experienced by the blocking particle at its blocking site from the equation derived by Woodhull (32Woodhull A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 61: 687-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 33Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar),logKi(V)=logKi(0mV)+(zδFV/2.303RT)Equation 2 where log Ki (V) is theKi at each voltage, Ki (0 mV) is the Ki at 0 mV, z is the electronic charge of the blocking particle, δ is the fraction of the voltage field sensed by the blocker from the outside of the membrane,R, F, and T have their usual thermodynamic meanings, and V is voltage. The solid line is the best fit of the antilog of Equation 2 to the data. δ was estimated to be ∼0.6 the distance of the voltage field from the extracellular side. The inhibition of currents by voltage-dependent blockers is often time-dependent; as membrane potential is changed, the current changes as the blocker accumulates or is removed from the blocking site. Fig. 2 showsICl(Ca) currents in response to 100-ms duration voltage pulses from a holding potential of 0 mV to voltages between +100 and −100 mV. In the absence of A9C (Fig. 2 A), outward currents were time-independent. Inward currents at the most negative potentials exhibited a slow decrease in current; currents decreased <10% in 100 ms. I-V curves were plotted for the current at the beginning (squares) and at the end (circles) of the 100-ms pulses (Fig. 2 B). Both curves were approximately linear. In the presence of 10 μm A9C (Fig. 2 C), the outward currents exhibited pronounced time dependence. The currents decayed with time as A9C block developed (Fig. 2 C), and theI-V curves measured at the beginning and end of the voltage pulses diverged at positive potentials. Increasing the [A9C] increased both the rate and the degree of block of the outward current (Fig. 2, E–H). The decay of the current upon stepping from 0 to +100 mV was fitted to a single exponential. The time constants were concentration-dependent; τ = 42.5 ± 1.2 ms at 10 μm A9C, 16.4 ± 1.1 ms at 30 μmA9C, and 11.6 ± 0.4 ms at 100 μm A9C (n = 3 for each). These data are consistent with a model in which A9C enters the pore of the channel and blocks it in a voltage-dependent manner. To determine whether A9C also blocked from the inside, we obtained inside-out patches (Fig.3). Surprisingly, A9C applied from the cytoplasmic side of the patch also blocked outward current (Fig.3 A). If A9C had blocked the channel from the inside in a similar manner to block from the outside, we would have expected A9C applied on the cytoplasmic surface to block inward, not outward, current. Woodhull analysis of the voltage-dependent block showed that δ = 0.6 (Fig. 3 B). Thus, A9C blocked outward current at the same site in the channel with the same voltage dependence whether it was applied from the inside or outside. The most logical interpretation of these data is that A9C blocks only from the outside but that it crosses the lipid membrane and gains access to the outside when applied from the inside. If this is true, we might expect that the apparent Ki for block by A9C applied on the inside would be larger than when applied from the outside, because the actual concentration of A9C on the outside when applied from the inside would be lower than expected. In support of this idea, the Ki for A9C applied to the inside at 0 mV was 945 μm and at +100 mV was 103.7 μm, ∼5–6-fold greater than the Ki for A9C applied from the outside at the same voltage. In addition, DPC, which has a similar structure to A9C, has been shown to cross lipid membranes readily at neutral pH (see references and “Discussion” in Ref.34Schultz B.D. Singh A.K. Devor D.C. Bridges R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79 Suppl. 1: 109-144Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar). A similar analysis was performed for DPC (Fig.4). In outside-out patches DPC blocked outward current in a dose-dependent manner with an apparentKi at 0 mV of 323 μm and at 100 mV of 111 μm. In the experiment illustrated, there was also a small effect on inward current, but it was difficult to determine whether this was a true inhibitory effect or was related to channel rundown, which occurs in some patches. Woodhull analysis of DPC is presented in Fig. 4, B–D. The voltage dependence of the relative current (I/IDPC = 0) in Fig.4 B shows that the block by DPC is clearly voltage-dependent. However, the voltage dependence is less than that of A9C (Fig. 1, C and D). δ was estimated to be 0.3. These data show that DPC blocks in a voltage-dependent manner but that the blocking site is not as deep in the pore as the A9C blocking site. The kinetics of voltage-dependent block by DPC were faster than block by A9C (Fig. 5). Fig. 5,A and B, shows current traces in response to a series of voltage pulses from 0 mV to voltages between −100 mV and +100 mV for 0 and 300 μm DPC, respectively. Fig.5 C shows current traces from the voltage pulses from −100 to +100 mV on a faster time scale for four different DPC concentrations. As [DPC] was increased, a more pronounced time-dependent tail current was observed at the onset of the pulse. The time constant was faster than 1 ms. TheI-V curves showed clearly increasing inward rectification with increasing DPC concentration (Fig.5 D). DPC, like A9C, can cross the membrane when applied from the inside in inside-out patches and block the channel from the outside (Fig.6). DPC applied from the inside blocked outward current with a Ki of 212 μm at 100 mV, which was about twice the Ki for inhibition from the outside. The estimated δ was 0.2, which was similar to the estimate for DPC applied from the outside. As noted above, DPC has been shown to partition readily into lipid membranes at neutral pH (34Schultz B.D. Singh A.K. Devor D.C. Bridges R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79 Suppl. 1: 109-144Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar). DIDS applied to the extracellular side decreased outward Cl− current in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7 A). Block was clearly voltage-dependent (Fig. 7 B). The apparentKi at 0 mV was 562 μm and at +100 mV was 48 μm. δ was estimated to be 0.3 (Fig. 7,C and D). 100 μm DIDS applied to the cytoplasmic side blocked inward current >50% and outward current ∼30%, but the block required >1 min to develop (Fig.8). In contrast, DIDS (and the other blockers used here) applied to outside-out patches produced a steady-state block within several seconds. Because this slowness of block suggested that the mechanisms were significantly different from block from the outside, we did not analyze these results quantitatively. NFA has been widely used to block Ca2+-activated Cl− channels inXenopus oocytes (35White M.M. Aylwin M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 720-724PubMed Google Scholar). In outside-out patches, NFA applied to the extracellular face blocked both inward and outward current (Fig.9 A). The apparentKi was 12.9 μm at 0 mV and 10.1 μm at +100 mV (Fig. 9 D). Although plots ofI/INFA = 0 versus Vm (Fig. 9, B and C) showed some curvature at the highest NFA concentrations, the voltage dependence was rather small. Woodhull analysis (Fig. 9, Cand D) showed that the apparent Ki did not change significantly between 20 mV (11.6 μm) and 100 mV (10.1 μm). The best linear fit to the data in Fig.9 D yielded a small slope that translated into an estimate for δ of 0.1. NFA applied to the cytoplasmic face of inside-out patches also blocked both inward and outward current (Fig.10 A) with aKi of 53.7 μm at +100 mV (Fig.10 B). This Ki is about 4 times greater than Ki for NFA applied from the outside. We do not know whether block of NFA from the inside involves NFA crossing the membrane and blocking from the outside. However, because NFA is very closely related to DPC, we presume that it crosses the membrane readily. There was no voltage dependence to the block (Fig.10 C). The data on the block of Ca2+-activated Cl− channels inXenopus oocytes by various pharmacological agents is summarized in Table I. In outside-out patches, block of Cl− current with externally applied blockers exhibited an order of potency of NFA > A9C > DIDS > DPC. Block by NFA was not voltage-dependent, but the blocks by A9C, DIDS, and DPC were voltage-dependent. NFA blocked both inward and outward current, whereas the other blockers blocked only outward current significantly. Block by all four blockers was always reversible under these conditions.Table IVoltage-dependent block of Cl(Ca) currentsOutside-outInside-outKi (100 mV)Ki (0 mV)δKi (100 mV)Ki(0 mV)δA9C18.3 ± 3.6 (4)158 ± 17 (4)0.6 (3)103.7 ± 28.5 (3)945 ± 162 (3)0.6 (3)DPC111 ± 9.9 (3)323 ± 56 (3)0.3 (3)212.7 ± 8.2 (3)422 ± 20 (3)0.2 (3)DIDS48 ± 7.7 (3)562 ± 39 (3)0.3 (3)N/A 1-aN/A, not applicable.N/AN/ANFA10.1 ± 3.7 (4)12.9 ± 3 (4)<0.1 (3)53.7 ± 4.8 (3)N/AN/AThe numbers in the parentheses show n (the number of patches in each experiment); Ki is in μm. δ is the fraction of the voltage field experienced by the blocker.1-a N/A, not applicable.

To better understand the role of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, we analyzed signaling by a kinase-inactive EGFR (K721M) in ErbB-devoid 32D cells. K721M alone exhibited no detectable signaling capacity, whereas coexpression of K721M with ErbB2, but not ErbB3 or ErbB4, resulted in EGF-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. The kinase activity, but not tyrosine phosphorylation, of ErbB2 was required for EGF-induced MAPK activation. The presence of tyrosine phosphorylation sites in K721M was not a requisite for signaling, indicating that transphosphorylation of K721M by ErbB2 was not an essential mechanism of receptor activation. Conversely, the mutated kinase domain of K721M (residues 648–973) and tyrosine phosphorylation of at least one of the receptors were necessary. EGF was found to activate the pro-survival protein kinase Akt in stable cell lines expressing K721M and ErbB2 but, unlike cells expressing wild-type EGFR, was incapable of activating signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) or driving cell proliferation. These results demonstrate that EGFR-ErbB2 oligomers are potent activators of MAPK and Akt, and this signaling does not require EGFR kinase activity.

These results demonstrate that EGFR-ErbB2 oligomers are potent activators of MAPK and Akt, and this signaling does not require EGFR kinase activity. epidermal growth factor receptor mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis interleukin The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR,1 ErbB1, HER1) is the prototypical member of the ErbB family of receptors, which includes ErbB2 (HER2, neu), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4) (reviewed in Refs. 1Carraway III, K.L.

The ErbBs mediate signaling by a large number of growth factors that are structurally related to EGF such as transforming growth factor-α or amphiregulin. This family of receptors plays critical roles in the proliferation, migration, survival, and differentiation of target cells, and dysregulation of signaling by ErbBs has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of human cancers (2Tzahar E. Yarden Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: M25-37PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hynes N.E. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). ErbBs are activated via a process of receptor homo- and heterodimerization, which is initiated by engagement of ligand by the extracellular domain of an ErbB, and almost every possible dimeric combination of ErbBs have now been observed (reviewed in Refs. 1Carraway III, K.L.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6093-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Unlike EGFR, ErbB3, and ErbB4, no ligand has been identified for ErbB2 to date. Recent work has demonstrated that binding of EGF to EGFRs initiates a ligand-independent lateral propagation of receptor activation in the plasma membrane (6Verveer P.J. Wouters F.S. Reynolds A.R. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2000; 290: 1567-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). ErbBs consist of an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane spanning segment, an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, and a C-terminal region that contains multiple tyrosines, which upon phosphorylation provide docking sites for signal transducers such as GRB2 and SHC (7Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Unlike other family members, ErbB3 does not possess kinase activity (8Guy P.M. Platko J.V.

Early research on the EGFR indicated that the kinase activity was required for EGF-induced biological responses (9Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G.

However, subsequent studies have demonstrated that kinase-inactive forms of the EGFR have the capacity to signal in an EGF-dependent manner. EGF-stimulated kinase-inactive EGFRs activate MAPK, c-fos gene expression, and/or DNA synthesis (11Campos-Gonzalez R. Glenney Jr., J.R. J. Biol.

Targeted inactivation of the EGFR gene in mice results in strain-dependent phenotypes that range from death in utero to postnatal abnormalities in skin, lung, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and brain (17Miettinen P.J.

Waved-2(wa-2) mice, which harbor a V743G mutation in the EGFR kinase domain exhibit mild skin and eye abnormalities but are healthy and fertile (20Luetteke N.C. Phillips H.K. Qiu T.H. Copeland N.G.

Interestingly, the V743G mutation results in a kinase-defective EGFR whose ability to phosphorylate exogenous substrate has been reduced by >90% relative to its wild-type counterpart (20Luetteke N.C. Phillips H.K. Qiu T.H. Copeland N.G. Earp H.S. Jenkins N.A. Lee D.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The homologous mutation in the human EGFR (V741G) significantly impairs EGFR kinase activity, and ectopic expression of V741G EGFR in myeloid BaF/3 cells confers the ability for EGF to induce survival but not proliferation (22Walker F. Hibbs M.L. Zhang H.H. Gonez L.J. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1998; 16: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Walker F. Kato A. Gonez L.J. Hibbs M.L. Pouliot N. Levitzki A. Burgess A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Conversely, kinase-impaired V741G EGFR can elicit EGF-dependent mitogenesis when expressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (21Fowler K.J. Walker F. Alexander W. Hibbs M.L. Nice E.C. Bohmer R.M. Mann G.B. Thumwood C. Maglitto R. Danks J.A. Chetty R. Burgess A.W. Dunn A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1465-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings raise the possibility that the EGFR kinase activity may not be required for certain aspects of EGFR function. To better understand the role of the EGFR kinase activity in mediating EGF-stimulated cellular responses we studied signaling by a kinase-inactive EGFR in which a lysine to methionine mutation (K721M) abrogates ATP binding. Because most cell types express one or more endogenous ErbBs, an elucidation of the mechanism of EGF-induced signaling by ectopically expressed kinase-inactive EGFRs has been elusive. To circumvent this problem, we have utilized the ErbB-devoid myeloid 32D cells as a model system into which we reconstituted K721M signaling. Our studies demonstrate a specific requirement for ErbB2 in K721M signaling and indicate that signaling is mediated by a K721M-ErbB2 oligomer. The EGF-stimulated hetero-oligomer is a strong activator of MAPK and the pro-survival kinase Akt, and EGFR kinase activity is not required for this signaling. The 32D cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% medium conditioned by WEHI-3B cells (24Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Cells stably expressing human EGFR were provided by J. Pierce (NCI, National Institutes of Health; Ref.25Pierce J.H. Ruggiero M. Fleming T.P. DiFiore P.P. Greenberger J.S. Varticovski L. Schlessinger J. Rovera G. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1988; 239: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Antibodies to EGFR and ErbB2 were obtained from NeoMarkers. Biotinylated PY-20 and 4G10 antibodies were purchased from ICN Biomedical and Upstate Biotechnology, respectively. Antibodies directed against the phosphorylated activated forms of MAPK, STATs, and Akt were obtained from New England BioLabs. Antibodies against ErbB3 and Akt were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. ErbB cDNAs were provided by J. Pierce and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1/Zeo. Mutations within cDNAs constructs were made using standard molecular biology techniques, and all constructs were DNA-sequenced. Cells were transfected with 20 μg of total DNA by electroporation (960 μF, 0.25 kV) using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II. Stable transfectants were generated using the neomycin resistance marker in pcDNA3.1 or the Zeocin resistance marker in pcDNA3.1/Zeo. Clonal populations were generated by serial dilution and characterized by flow cytometry and Western blotting. Assays were performed as previously described (27Alimandi M. Wang L.-M. Bottaro D. Lee C.C. Kuo A. Frankel M. Fedi P. Tang C. Lippman M. Pierce J.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5608-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed, resuspended into 60 × 15 mm dishes (100,000 cells/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum (basal medium) with or without 10 nm EGF. Cells were stained with trypan blue, and viable cells were counted every day using a hemocytometer. Whole cell lysates were generated, and protein concentration was determined as described (34David M. Wong L. Flavell R. Thompson S.A. Wells A. Larner A.C. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9185-9188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). One μg of antibody was added to 0.5 mg of lysate, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and 5 μl of protein G-agarose was added. After 1 h at 4 °C, the immune complexes were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 2 min and washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. Bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 4 min. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed with 0.3 μg/ml of primary antibody, and detection was performed using the Vectastain ABC Elite Kit (Vector Labs), enhanced chemiluminescence, and exposed to film. To explore the signaling potential of a kinase-inactive EGFR, we studied signaling by a mutant human EGFR in which a lysine to methionine mutation has been introduced into the ATP binding site (K721M). Work by us (data not shown) and others have demonstrated that this mutation abolishes the kinase activity of the EGFR (9Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1987; 328: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 10Honegger A.M. Szapary D. Schmidt A. Lyall R. Van Obberghen E. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4568-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To determine the intrinsic signaling capacity of K721M, we investigated EGF-dependent signaling by ectopically expressed K721M in the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent myeloid 32D cell line (24Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). This ErbB-devoid cell line has proved to be a powerful tool in the study of ErbB signaling (25Pierce J.H. Ruggiero M. Fleming T.P. DiFiore P.P. Greenberger J.S. Varticovski L. Schlessinger J. Rovera G. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1988; 239: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26Di Fiore P.P. Segatto O. Taylor W.G. Aaronson S.A. Pierce J.H. Science. 1990; 248: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27Alimandi M. Wang L.-M. Bottaro D. Lee C.C. Kuo A. Frankel M. Fedi P. Tang C. Lippman M. Pierce J.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5608-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 32D cells were transiently transfected with K721M cDNA and stimulated with EGF (Fig. 1 A). Lysates were analyzed for MAPK activation using an antibody specific for phosphorylated Thr-202/Tyr-204 in the activated form of MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2; top panel). No activation of MAPK was detected under these conditions even though expression of K721M was confirmed by Western blotting (lanes 1–2). To test the hypothesis that kinase-devoid forms of the EGFR can signal in the presence of additional human ErbB family members, we simultaneously expressed K721M along with ErbB2, ErbB3, or ErbB4. Interestingly, although ErbB2 by itself was unable to promote MAPK phosphorylation in response to EGF (data not shown), coexpression of K721M with ErbB2 (lanes 3–4) resulted in EGF-induced MAPK stimulation. In contrast, coexpression of K721M with either ErbB3 or ErbB4 could not reconstitute EGF-dependent signaling by K721M (lanes 6 and 8). No differences in the magnitude of MAPK activation were observed when the ratio of transfected K721M:ErbB2 cDNAs was varied from 3 to 0.33 (data not shown), suggesting that signaling to MAPK was independent of the relative levels of the receptors. EGF dose-response studies (Fig.1 B) revealed that both EGFR or coexpressed K721M-ErbB2 activate MAPK at 10 pm EGF, with the EGFR-induced signal being slightly stronger (compare lanes 2 and 7). Maximal MAPK stimulation was observed at 100 pm EGF for both EGFR and K721M-ErbB2 (lanes 3 and 8), indicating that physiologically relevant concentrations of EGF can activate MAPK in cells coexpressing K721M and ErbB2. To determine whether ErbB2 tyrosine kinase activity was obligatory for this signaling, we introduced an aspartic acid to asparagine mutation into the catalytic domain of ErbB2 (D845N). This mutation abolished the ability of ErbB2 to support MAPK stimulation by coexpressed K721M (Fig.2, lanes 3–4), demonstrating the requirement for the ErbB2 kinase activity. The C-terminal region of ErbB2 contains 6 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites positioned at 1023, 1127, 1139, 1196, 1222, and 1249, which can function as docking sites for signal-transducing proteins (1Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). To explore the role of ErbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation in supporting K721M signaling, a C-terminal-truncated form of ErbB2 comprising residues 1–1026 was coexpressed with K721M. This truncated ErbB2 was able to mediate EGF-induced MAPK activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of K721M while not being tyrosine phosphorylated itself (Fig. 2, lane 6). Identical results were obtained when the remaining tyrosine at position 1023 was converted to phenylalanine in this truncated ErbB2 (data not shown). Further, the D845N ErbB2 mutant did not elicit phosphorylation of either K721M or itself in response to EGF (lane 4). The C-terminal region of EGFR contains 6 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites positioned at 992, 1068, 1086, 1114, 1148, and 1173 (1Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). C-terminal truncations of K721M at either residue 1000 or 973 had no detectable effect on ErbB2-dependent MAPK activation by EGF, but did eliminate tyrosine phosphorylation of the truncated K721M receptors (Fig. 3, compare lane 2 with 4 and 6). In contrast, ErbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation was unaffected by the truncation of K721M at residues 1000 or 973. However, truncation of the EGFR on the cytoplasmic side of the transmembrane region obliterated all detectable signaling (lane 8). c-Src has been shown to phosphorylate the EGFR at Tyr-845 (28Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, mutation of Tyr-845 to Phe within K721M-(1–973) had no detectable effect on the EGF-induced MAPK activation, which is mediated by ErbB2 (data not shown). Thus, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of K721M is not a requisite for the EGF-stimulated MAPK activation via ErbB2, the mutated kinase domain of K721M (residues 648–973) is required. As shown in Figs. 2and 3, removal of the C-terminal region of either K721M or ErbB2 did not influence EGF-stimulated MAPK activation. Thus, we tested the effect of simultaneous deletions of the C-terminal regions of K721M and ErbB2 in this signaling system (Fig. 4). Truncation of K721M at residue 973 resulted in a complete loss of its tyrosine phosphorylation and a dramatic reduction in MAPK activation in cells coexpresssing ErbB2-(1–1026) (lanes 2 and4). The tyrosine residue in oncogenic neu (rat ErbB2), which corresponds to position 1023 in human ErbB2, is a negative regulator of neu-mediated transformation (29Dankort D.L. Wang Z. Blackmore V. Moran M.F. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5410-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We tested whether mutation of Tyr-1023 to Phe in ErbB2-(1–1026) increased EGF-induced MAPK stimulation by K721M-(1–973). However, this mutation did not restore MAPK activation by EGF (lane 6). These data demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of either K721M or ErbB2 is required for maximal MAPK activation by EGF. To further investigate the EGF-stimulated signaling by coexpressed K721M and ErbB2, we generated cell lines that stably expressed these receptors. 32D cells were transfected with K721M cDNA, selected in G418, and the clones obtained by serial dilution were screened for surface expression of K721M by flow cytometry analysis (data not shown) and Western blot-ting (Fig. 5 A,lower panel). Three independent clones, namely 9.10, 9.11, and 9.16, were selected, and consistent with the results obtained in transient expression assays displayed in Fig. 1, these K721M clones were incapable of activating MAPK in response to EGF (Fig. 5A,lanes 6, 8, and 10). However, transient expression of ErbB2 resulted in reconstitution of MAPK stimulation by EGF in all three clones (lanes 12,14, and 16), demonstrating that K721M in these clones was functional. As a control for these experiments, we utilized 32D cells stably expressing human EGFR (lanes 1–2; Refs.25Pierce J.H. Ruggiero M. Fleming T.P. DiFiore P.P. Greenberger J.S. Varticovski L. Schlessinger J. Rovera G. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1988; 239: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26Di Fiore P.P. Segatto O. Taylor W.G. Aaronson S.A. Pierce J.H. Science. 1990; 248: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27Alimandi M. Wang L.-M. Bottaro D. Lee C.C. Kuo A. Frankel M. Fedi P. Tang C. Lippman M. Pierce J.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5608-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Clone 9.10 was then transfected with a vector containing ErbB2 cDNA and a zeocin-resistance marker to generate 5 stable clones that simultaneously expressed K721M and varying amounts of ErbB2 (Fig.5 B, lanes 7–16). EGF activated MAPK in all five cell lines consistent with results obtained in transient expression assays (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). We then evaluated the EGF-induced activation of the protein kinase Akt, which plays an important role in cell survival (30Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Because activation of Akt results from phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473, we monitored activation using antibodies that specifically recognize these two phosphorylated sites (Fig. 5 B). Treatment of all stable cell lines coexpressing K721M and ErbB2 with EGF elicited phosphorylation of Akt on Thr-308 and Ser-473 to levels comparable with cells stably expressing EGFR (lanes 2, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16). Withdrawal of IL-3 from 32D cells leads to the accumulation of cells in G1 and rapid apoptosis (31Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar). However, as seen in Fig. 6 Aand as previously demonstrated (25Pierce J.H. Ruggiero M. Fleming T.P. DiFiore P.P. Greenberger J.S. Varticovski L. Schlessinger J. Rovera G. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1988; 239: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), expression of EGFR in 32D cells allows EGF to supplant the IL-3 requirement. Thus, it was important to evaluate the mitogenic and anti-apoptotic potential of EGF in cells expressing K721M alone or in the presence of ErbB2. EGF had no discernable effect on 32D cells expressing K721M alone (clone 9.10), which, like the parental cells, underwent rapid apoptosis upon IL-3 deprivation (Fig. 6 B). Identical findings were obtained with clones 9.11 and 9.16, which also harbor K721M (data not shown). Treatment of clone 7.1, which coexpresses K721M and ErbB2, with EGF resulted in a delayed onset of apoptosis compared with untreated cells (Fig. 6 C). After 24 h of exposure to EGF, clone 7.1 cells were still viable, but underwent apoptosis during the subsequent 24 h period. This finding was consistent in all five of the 32D clones, which express both K721M and ErbB2 (data not shown). Therefore, unlike EGFR, the activated K721M-ErbB2 receptors are incapable of generating a proliferative response in the 32D cell context. One explanation for this difference could be that EGF induces the expression and secretion of IL-3 in cells, which express EGFR, but not in cells which express K721M and ErbB2. To test the hypothesis that IL-3 may function as an autocrine mitogen for EGF-treated EGFR 32D cells, we harvested conditioned medium from EGF-treated EGFR cells and attempted to grow the parental ErbB-devoid 32D cells in this medium. We observed no proliferative response in 32D cells to this conditioned medium (data not shown). We also monitored the effect of anti-IL-3 neutralizing antibodies on the EGF-stimulated growth of EGFR 32D cells. Whereas these antibodies blocked the mitogenic response of the EGFR cells to exogenous IL-3, they had no effect on the EGF-induced growth (data not shown). Therefore, the proliferation of the EGFR cells by EGF is not because of an IL-3-mediated autocrine loop. Two additional potential explanations for the lack of an EGF-induced proliferative response in K721M-ErbB2 cells were explored. First, it was possible that the activation of MAPK and Akt in these cells was transient and thus, not sufficient to drive cell division. Interestingly, a kinetic analysis in cells expressing EGFR or cells expressing K721M and ErbB2 (clone 7.1) revealed a strong and prolonged activation of Akt and MAPK by EGF that persisted for 24 h for MAPK and 8 h for Ser-473 of Akt (Fig.7 A). Phosphorylation of Akt on Thr-308 was more transient and decreased to baseline levels after 30 min of exposure to EGF (lanes 1–4 and 11–14). Within these parameters signaling by 32D cells possessing EGFR is virtually indistinguishable from those harboring kinase-inactive K721M simultaneously with ErbB2. Therefore, activation of MAPK and Akt does not provide an explanation for the inability of K721M-ErbB2 cells to grow in response to EGF. Secondly, activation of STAT5 is critical to the survival and growth of myeloid cells (32Ilaria Jr., R.L. Hawley R.G. Van Etten R.A. Blood. 1999; 93: 4154-4166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Nakamura N. Chin H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19483-19488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory had demonstrated that EGFR ligands activate STATs 1, 3, and 5 in an EGFR kinase-dependent, Janus kinase (Jak)1-independent manner (34David M. Wong L. Flavell R. Thompson S.A. Wells A. Larner A.C. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9185-9188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To test whether EGF was able to activate STATs in cells simultaneously expressing K721M and ErbB2, we utilized antibodies specific for the phosphorylated, activated forms of STAT1 (pY701), STAT3 (pY705), and STAT5 (pY694/pY699) (Fig. 7 B). Evaluation of lysates derived from clone 7.1 cells treated with EGF for 10 min indicated that the K721M-ErbB2 receptors were not capable of activating any of the STATs (lane 4). Exposure of these cells to EGF for 5 or 30 min also did not result in any detectable STAT activation, and identical results were obtained using the clone 7.5 (data not shown). Further, IL-3 was able to activate STATs 1, 3, and 5 in both clone 7.1 and 7.5 (data not shown). Activation of STATs 1, 3, and 5 was easily detected in the 32D cells expressing EGFR (lane 2). Therefore, there was a correlation between EGF-induced proliferation and activation of STATs in the cell lines expressing either EGFR or K721M-ErbB2. The research presented here better defines the function and requirement of the EGFR kinase activity in EGF signaling. Early work indicated that the EGFR kinase was required for EGF-induced biological responses (9Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G.

Biol. 1987; 7: 4568-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In contrast, additional studies revealed that kinase-inactive forms of the EGFR have the capacity to signal in an EGF-dependent manner when ectopically expressed in certain cells. Kinase-inactive EGFRs have been reported to stimulate MAPK, c-fos gene expression, and/or DNA synthesis (11Campos-Gonzalez R. Glenney Jr., J.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12085-12093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Several possible explanations for this signaling have been proposed and include the following. (i) The dimerized kinase-inactive EGFR alone has the intrinsic ability to signal, possibly through the recruitment of additional signaling proteins. (ii) Signaling by ectopically expressed kinase-inactive EGFRs occurs through a process of signal amplification, which is initiated by undetectable low levels of endogenous kinase-active EGFRs, and (iii) signaling occurs because of an interaction with another kinase, such as an ErbB-like protein. Our findings indicate that in ErbB-devoid 32D cells, kinase-inactive EGFRs have no intrinsic signaling capacity. Instead, we present strong evidence that signaling by kinase-inactive EGFRs is mediated by ErbB2 but not by the related ErbB3 and ErbB4. Further, using a signaling model of EGFR-ErbB2 oligomers in the absence of kinase-active EGFR homodimers, we demonstrate that the EGFR·ErbB2 complex is a strong activator of MAPK and the pro-survival protein kinase Akt, and that ErbB2, but not EGFR, kinase activity was a requisite for this process. Targeted disruption of the murineEGFR gene results in lethality (17Miettinen P.J. Berger J.E. Meneses J. Phung Y. Pedersen R.A. Werb Z. Derynck R.

Science. 1995; 269: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar), whereaswaved-2 mice, which possess an EGFR whose kinase activity is significantly impaired, are healthy and viable (20Luetteke N.C. Phillips H.K. Qiu T.H. Copeland N.G. Earp H.S. Jenkins N.A. Lee D.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). These findings provide strong evidence that a significant component of EGFR signaling is independent of EGFR kinase activity. Of all ErbBs, ErbB2 is considered to be the most widely expressed and is almost always coexpressed with EGFR in epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that the K721M-ErbB2 oligomer is exquisitely sensitive to ligand because physiological concentrations of EGF (10 pm) readily activated MAPK (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, one might expect ErbB2 to play a significant role in certain aspects of EGFR signaling in vivo. Biochemical analysis of signaling through K721M-ErbB2 oligomers in 32D cells showed that EGF activated Ras (data not shown), MAPK and Akt, but not STATs 1, 3, and 5. However, EGF could not supplant the growth requirement of these cells for IL-3. Conversely, EGF was mitogenic in 32D cells expressing wild-type EGFR as has been previously shown (25Pierce J.H. Ruggiero M. Fleming T.P. DiFiore P.P. Greenberger J.S. Varticovski L. Schlessinger J. Rovera G. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1988; 239: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The finding that the K721M-ErbB2 oligomer is incapable of mediating proliferation of these cells extends previous work demonstrating that overexpression of ErbB2 was not able to induce proliferation of 32D cells, despite the fact that similar ErbB2 overexpression resulted in potent transformation of fibroblasts (26Di Fiore P.P. Segatto O. Taylor W.G. Aaronson S.A. Pierce J.H. Science. 1990; 248: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This difference in the ability of EGFR and ErbB2 to generate a mitogenic signal in 32D cells was attributed to their respective kinase domains, demonstrating cell context specificity for mitogenic signaling by EGFR and ErbB2. In our studies, the kinetics and magnitude of activation of the MAPK and Akt pathways by 32D cells expressing either K721M-ErbB2 or EGFR were virtually indistinguishable (Fig.7 A) indicating that defects in these pathways could not explain the differential growth response of the cells to EGF. Additionally, the secretion of an EGF-induced autocrine growth factor, such as IL-3, was ruled out as a reason for the proliferative response in EGFR cells. The inability of the K721M-ErbB2 complex to activate STAT transcription factors in response to EGF, however, may provide an explanation for the lack of a mitogenic response in 32D cells. EGF activates STATs 1, 3 and 5 via an EGFR kinase-dependent, EGFR autophosphorylation- and Jak1-independent mechanism, which appears to require c-Src (16Wright J.D. Reuter C.W.M. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12085-12093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34David M. Wong L. Flavell R. Thompson S.A. Wells A. Larner A.C. Johnson G.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17209-17218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Activation of STAT5 is essential in the survival and proliferation of myeloid cells (32Ilaria Jr., R.L. Hawley R.G. Van Etten R.A. Blood. 1999; 93: 4154-4166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of an EGFR-Jak2 chimera in 32D cells results in EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 5 and cell proliferation (33Nakamura N. Chin H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19483-19488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, the inability of EGF-activated K721M-ErbB2 oligomers to elicit proliferation in 32D cells may be related to the lack of STAT5 activation. It is believed that transmodulation of ErbB2 by EGF occurs via the generation of an EGFR-ErbB2 heterodimer (1Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 2Tzahar E. Yarden Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: M25-37PubMed Google Scholar, 3Riese 2nd, D.J. Stern D.F.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6093-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). More recent data suggested that ErbBs may be activated by a heterotetrameric mode of receptor kinase interaction (36Gamett D.C. Pearson G. Cerione R.A. Friedberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12052-12056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 37Huang G.C. Ouyang X. Epstein R.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Biophysical studies of ligand-induced dimerization of the soluble extracellular domains of ErbBs were unable to demonstrate the existence of EGFR-ErbB2, ErbB2-ErbB3, or ErbB3-ErbB3 dimers, but were able to observe EGFR-EGFR, ErbB4-ErbB4, and ErbB2-ErbB4 dimers (38Ferguson K.M. Darling P.J. Mohan M.J. Macatee T.L. Lemmon M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4632-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) causing the authors to question the prevailing heterodimerization model of ErbB activation. Our findings are more consistent with a model of EGF-bound K721M homodimers, which recruit and activate ErbB2 homodimers, and are inconsistent with signaling by K721M-ErbB2 heterodimers for several reasons. First, removal of all tyrosine phosphorylation sites in K721M had no effect on EGF-stimulated MAPK activation. If transphosphorylation of K721M by ErbB2 in a heterodimeric complex is critical to transmodulation, as required in the heterodimer model, then tyrosine phosphorylation acceptor sites should be required, at least to some extent. Secondly, EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 occurs in the absence of EGFR kinase activity. Both activation of MAPK and tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 by EGF requires ErbB2 kinase activity. The simplest explanation for this observation is that a K721M homodimer presents an interface for an interaction with a monomeric ErbB2, which upon engagement, recruits an additional ErbB2 to form a [K721M]2[ErbB2]2 heterotetramer. Within this complex one ErbB2 can transphosphorylate the other in the activated homodimer. Of course, we cannot rule out that an EGF-activated heterologous kinase phosphorylates ErbB2, but this kinase would require ErbB2 kinase activity for activation. Our data demonstrate a requirement for the mutated kinase domain of K721M (residues 648–973) in K721M-ErbB2 signaling. Assuming that the truncated EGFR possessing the extracellular and transmembrane domains can dimerize in response to EGF, it suggests that the mutated kinase domains of dimerized K721M contribute to the formation of an interface for ErbB2 recruitment. Tyrosine phosphorylation of at least one of the ErbBs in the oligomeric complex is necessary for activation of MAPK, presumably because this will provide docking sites for adaptor proteins such as GRB2 and SHC, which can localize the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, son-of-sevenless, to the plasma membrane where it can activate Ras. Importantly, focal stimulation of cells with EGF results in an extensive propagation of ligand-independent receptor phosphorylation over the entire cell surface (6Verveer P.J. Wouters F.S. Reynolds A.R. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2000; 290: 1567-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It is possible that EGF-bound K721M homo-oligomers inititate a similar propagation of receptor activation which involves ErbB2. The work reported here provides an explanation of how a kinase-inactive EGFR can generate an EGF-dependent signal and implies that certain aspects of EGF signaling may be EGFR kinase-independent in vivo. Further, these results underscore the importance of ErbB2 in EGF signaling and allow us to attribute specific signaling events to the EGF-activated EGFR-ErbB2 oligomer. We found that the EGF-stimulated EGFR-ErbB2 complex is a potent activator of MAPK and Akt, and ErbB2, but not EGFR, kinase activity is required for this signaling."

However, whether these effects are due to nucleotide binding to cyt c or to cytc oxidase, or both remains unclear as both cyt cand cyt c oxidase have been shown to contain at least one nucleotide-binding site (5Corthésy B.E.

Wallace C.J.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when the ATP-binding site of cyt cis occupied by a covalently bound ATP, the electron-transfer activity of cyt c with reductase and oxidase are inhibited to 41 and 11–15%, respectively, of the values measured for the native protein (3Craig D.B. Wallace C.J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2686-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the redox potential of the above modified cytc remains close to the value of the native form (11Lin J. Wu S. Lau W. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2678-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated ATP-induced changes in the structure of cyt c. For example, auto-oxidation of reduced cytc takes place upon its gel filtration in the presence of ATP (7Craig D.B. Wallace C.J.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas this is not observed in the absence of the nucleotide (12Dickerson R.E. Timkovitch R. Enzymes. 1975; 11: 397-547Crossref Scopus (403) Google Scholar). ATP has also been shown to reduce the thermal stability of cytc (13Antalik M. Bagelova J. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 1995; 14: 19-37PubMed Google Scholar).Interestingly, release of cyt c from mitochondria to cytoplasm has been found to be of critical importance in processes connected to programmed cell death (apoptosis), raising a novel and central point of interest in its properties (14Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar, 15Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.

Furthermore, this release represents in most cases the commitment step for the full activation of the cell death program (17Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Outlines of the apoptotic function of cyt c have been elucidated lately. In cytoplasm cyt c forms a complex with a protein called Apaf-1 and caspase-9, and formation of this “apoptosome” complex leads to the activation of the cascade of proteases executing apoptosis in cells. The presence and hydrolysis of ATP or dATP are required for the formation of the apoptosome and thus also make these nucleotides mediators of the programmed cell death (18Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar). The concentration range of ATP present in cytoplasms of living cells is millimolar (19Skoog L. Bjursell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 25: 6434-6438Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), which is sufficient for its binding to cyt c (7Craig D.B. Wallace C.J.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Based on the recognition of different conformations of cyt c by monoclonal antibodies, it was recently suggested that the apoptotically active cyt c is membrane-bound (20Jemmerson R. Liu J. Hausauer D. Lam K.P. Mondino A. Nelson R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The combined effects of ATP on cyt c and its membrane binding properties could thus provide a possible mechanism to regulate the activity of cytc in triggering apoptosis.The membrane association of cyt c has been extensively studied (21Kinnunen P.K.J. Kõiv A. Lehtonen J.Y.A. Rytömaa M. Mustonen P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 73: 181-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We have provided evidence for two distinct acidic phospholipid-binding sites in cyt c and have nominated these as the A- and C-sites (22Rytömaa M. Mustonen P. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22243-22248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, negative surface charge density of the liposomes, pH, and ionic strength together determine whether cyt c is bound electrostatically via its A-site or by hydrogen bonding via its C-site (22Rytömaa M. Mustonen P. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22243-22248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1770-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction of cytc with lipids has been suggested to involve additionally a hydrophobic interaction between the protein and an acidic phospholipid due to the so-called extended lipid anchorage (24Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3197-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 25Kinnunen P.K.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 81: 151-166Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this mechanism one of the acyl chains of acidic phospholipid is accommodated within a hydrophobic channel in cyt c (26Dickerson R.E. Takano T. Eisenberg D. Kallai O.B. Samson L. Cooper A. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1511-1535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the other chain(s) of the glycerophospholipid remain(s) in the lipid bilayer. ATP is able to dissociate the A-site- but not the C-site-mediated interaction of cyt c with acidic phospholipids (22Rytömaa M. Mustonen P. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol.

Mustonen P. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22243-22248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here evidence for a change in the conformation of cyt c to be induced by ATP, revealed by CD measurements in the Soret region, and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy of a cyt c analog with a Zn2+-substituted heme moiety. Resonance energy transfer measurements demonstrate this effect of ATP to be strongly attenuated for the lipid bound [Nle91]cyt c in which the high affinity ATP-binding site is abrogated.DISCUSSIONInteractions of cyt c with lipids have been thoroughly investigated, and cyt c is generally taken as a paradigm for an electrostatically membrane-bound peripheral protein bearing a net positive charge and associating with acidic phospholipids (21Kinnunen P.K.J.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7219-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) but with native-like helical secondary structure (49Pinheiro T.J.T. Elöve G.A. Watts A. Roder H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13122-13132Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The lipid-induced conformational changes were demonstrated to depend on the negative surface charge density in the membrane (54Muga A. Mantsch H.H. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7219-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Likewise, cardiolipin was more effective than phospholipids with a single negative charge (51de Jongh H.H. Ritsema T. Killian J.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The above is in keeping with the C-site of cyt c to be involved in mediating phospholipid-induced conformational alterations (23Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1770-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three different membrane-bound conformations for cyt c have been described (57Cortese J.D. Voglino L.A. Hackenbrock C.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6402-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and these authors demonstrated the presence of an electrostatically bound cyt c and two conformationally different membrane-bound types of cyt c that were not dissociable from the membrane by increasing ionic strength. Interestingly, the efficiency in electron transport was also different for the latter two conformations (57Cortese J.D. Voglino L.A. Hackenbrock C.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6402-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).The present data confirm changes in the conformation of cytc upon its binding to liposomes. Most important, we also demonstrate that further conformational alterations are induced by ATP in cyt c bound to phospholipids. These ATP-induced changes in the conformation of liposome-associated cyt c were further dependent on the lipid composition. Accordingly, they were observed in CD spectra only when using liposomes composed of the acidic PG. Under these conditions cyt c binds to membranes via the so-called C-site and attaches to the protonated head groups of PG. The C-site has been suggested to involve residue Asn52 and a fatty acid-binding hydrophobic cavity in cyt c (24Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3197-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). C-site lipid bound cyt c is not detached from liposomes by ATP, in contrast to the A-site-bound protein (23Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1770-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although the heme moiety as such is not optically active in solution, its interactions with the neighboring amino acid residues and distortions in its planarity render heme-containing proteins optically active, with the characteristic CD spectra in the Soret region near 400 nm. These CD spectra thus provide information on the variation of environment of the heme group and thus reflect the conformation of cytc. These spectra demonstrate pronounced differences in the conformations of cyt c bound to liposomes via the C- and A-sites as well as the conformation of cyt c in solution. Moreover, the structure of cyt c bound to liposomes via the C-site can be further altered by ATP, whereas no such effect was seen on the protein in solution or when interacting with lipids by its A-site. Although these CD spectra cannot be assigned to specific conformational features, qualitative properties may be discussed. The distinct shape of the spectrum for the C-site-bound cyt cwith sharp peaks and rotational strength equal to the unbound protein suggests an organized conformation instead of a molten globule-like state. This is in contrast to lipid-induced unfolding of cytc in the presence of phospholipid vesicles (49Pinheiro T.J.T. Elöve G.A. Watts A. Roder H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13122-13132Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) revealing a Soret region CD spectrum similar to guanidine hydrochloride denatured species (46Santucci R. Ascoli F. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1997; 68: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, in the latter study, conditions different from those used here were employed. More specifically, these authors used phosphatidylserine as the acidic phospholipid and at high concentration (several mm) which could explain the denaturing effect. Most important, we could demonstrate the presence of ATP to have further effects on the CD spectra (Fig. 2), thus revealing an ATP-induced conformational change in lipid-bound cyt c. The ATP-induced effect observed in the resonance energy transfer between the heme moiety of cyt c and the membrane-embedded lipid (Fig. 4.) could thus be explained by these conformational species having different properties as acceptors in the resonance energy transfer process. Except for decreased amplitudes of the peaks, the CD spectra for the A-site membrane-bound cyt c is identical to that of unbound cyt c in solution. The difference in amplitudes could be explained by more intense fluctuations in the heme environment of the A-site membrane-interacting protein, where the time-averaged structure would be identical to that of the free cytc. Unfortunately, the amounts of protein required for measuring CD spectra for Nle91 cyt c were prohibitively high.Measurement of fluorescence lifetimes provides an additional and extremely sensitive tool to study changes in the immediate microenvironment of a fluorophore (58Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). For this purpose we used the intensely fluorescent [Zn2+-heme]cyt c (38Anni H. Vanderkooi J.M. Mayne L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5744-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition to confirming that lipid binding induces structural changes in [Zn2+-heme]cyt c and demonstrating that ATP causes conformational changes in this protein, the present data reveal that ATP has pronounced additional effects on the structure of lipid-bound cyt c. Accordingly, our results reveal four different conformations for membrane-bound cyt c as follows, depending on the content of the acidic phospholipid in the membrane and the presence of ATP. At low content of acidic phospholipid and at neutral pH the cyt c is bound to lipids electrostatically via the A-site (23Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1770-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas higher concentrations of ATP (>2 mm) reverse this interaction, low [ATP] <2 mm appears to bind to the lipid-associated cyt cand to induce a conformational change, as demonstrated by the fluorescence lifetimes and fractional intensities for [Zn2+-heme]cyt c (Table I). At either XPG = 1.0 or at XPG = 0.20 and at acidic pH the interaction of cyt c involves protonated acidic phospholipids and has been nominated as C-site binding (23Rytömaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1770-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Judged from time-resolved fluorescence, the conformations of cyt cbound to lipids via the C-site and A-site are different. Also, in cytc bound to liposomes via the C-site interaction, further structural changes are caused by ATP, evident both in the fluorescence lifetime data for [Zn2+-heme]cyt c (Table I) as well as in the resonance energy transfer between the fluorescent membrane probe and wt-cyt c (Fig. 1). More specifically, for the C-site-bound cyt c the changes induced by ATP result in an augmented resonance energy transfer between the fluorescent pyrene-containing lipid analog PPDPG and the heme moiety of wt-cytc. This enhanced resonance energy transfer could result from an altered orientation of the dipoles involved due to changing orientation of the heme with respect to the membrane plane or reduced distance between the dipoles (22Rytömaa M. Mustonen P. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22243-22248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).A high affinity binding site for ATP has been described and shown to involve the invariant Arg91 (5Corthésy B.E. Wallace C.J.A. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 7Craig D.B. Wallace C.J.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Corthésy B.E. Wallace C.J.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 9Craig D.B. Wallace C.J.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Wallace C.J.A. Rose K. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The involvement of Arg91 in binding of ATP and consequent modulation of electron transfer by the protein has been investigated previously by semisynthetic analogs of cyt c in which this single arginine residue of the 66–104 peptide was chemically modified by cyclohexane-1,2-dione prior to ligation with the 1–65 peptide (10Wallace C.J.A. Rose K. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The [Nle91] analog used here binds ATP better than the previously describedN 7,N 8-(1,2-dihydroxycyclohex-1,2-ene)diyl-l-arginine 91-cyt c (7Craig D.B. Wallace C.J.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This difference probably reflects the fact that the latter modification introduces a bulky group, which prevents the approach of the nucleotide to the other moieties constituting this site. Because of this, the choice of norleucine as the substitution for arginine was made specifically with steric considerations in mind, as the side chain of residue 91 (Fig. 5) resides in the hydrophobic face of an amphipathic helix and is fully buried, with the exception of the guanido head group. A straight aliphatic chain of norleucine should thus fulfill the space-filling role of this residue. This analog had strongly reduced affinity for ATP, whereas its other characteristics remained unaffected. In order to study whether the above site was responsible also for the ATP-induced changes in cyt c bound to lipids, we examined the effect of ATP on the liposome association of the [Nle91]cytc. We have previously demonstrated that the interactions of [Nle91]cyt c with lipids differ from those of the wt-cyt c with lack of aggregation by [Nle91] of LUV composed of acidic phospholipid (27Tuominen E.K.J. Wallace C.J. A Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 140-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Most important, compared with the wild type the strongly reduced effect of ATP on the resonance energy transfer between the heme moiety of [Nle91]cyt c and the membrane-embedded fluorescent lipid (Fig. 4, panel B) strongly suggests that the invariant Arg91 is indeed important in mediating the conformational changes induced by ATP.The findings that the functional apoptotic cyt c is probably membrane-bound (20Jemmerson R. Liu J. Hausauer D. Lam K.P. Mondino A. Nelson R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and the requirement for ATP (16Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4433) Google Scholar, 18Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar) in cytc-mediated apoptosis further emphasizes the possible importance of the conformational effects of ATP on cyt c. It seems plausible to suggest that the ATP binding and the consequent conformational changes in both free and membrane-bound cyt cmay represent an evolutionarily conserved way to mediate the reactivity of cyt c and may have been adapted for use in the regulation of its biological functions. Cytochrome c (cytc)1 is a mitochondrial peripheral membrane protein functioning in the respiratory chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane, shuttling electrons from cyt c reductase to cyt c oxidase. An acidic phospholipid, cardiolipin, either alone or complexed with cyt c oxidase, provides the membrane-binding site (1Vik S.B. Georgevich G. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar,2Speck S.H. Neu C.A. Swanson M.S. Margoliash E. FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ATP can modulate the electron transfer rate between cytc and its redox partners (3Craig D.B. Wallace C.J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2686-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4Smith L. Davies H.C. Nava M.E. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1613-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, whether these effects are due to nucleotide binding to cyt c or to cytc oxidase, or both remains unclear as both cyt cand cyt c oxidase have been shown to contain at least one nucleotide-binding site (5Corthésy B.E. Wallace C.J.A. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 6Taanman J.-W. Turina P. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11833-11841Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In cyt c part of the high affinity ATP-binding site is constituted by the invariant Arg91 (5Corthésy B.E. Wallace C.J.A. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 7Craig D.B. Wallace C.J.A. Biochem.

J. 1983; 215: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and binding of ATP to this decreases the rate of electron flow through the mitochondrial electron transport chain (9Craig D.B. Wallace C.J.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when the ATP-binding site of cyt cis occupied by a covalently bound ATP, the electron-transfer activity of cyt c with reductase and oxidase are inhibited to 41 and 11–15%, respectively, of the values measured for the native protein (3Craig D.B. Wallace C.J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2686-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the redox potential of the above modified cytc remains close to the value of the native form (11Lin J. Wu S. Lau W. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2678-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated ATP-induced changes in the structure of cyt c. For example, auto-oxidation of reduced cytc takes place upon its gel filtration in the presence of ATP (7Craig D.B. Wallace C.J.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas this is not observed in the absence of the nucleotide (12Dickerson R.E. Timkovitch R. Enzymes. 1975; 11: 397-547Crossref Scopus (403) Google Scholar). ATP has also been shown to reduce the thermal stability of cytc (13Antalik M. Bagelova J. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 1995; 14: 19-37PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, release of cyt c from mitochondria to cytoplasm has been found to be of critical importance in processes connected to programmed cell death (apoptosis), raising a novel and central point of interest in its properties (14Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar, 15Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.

Furthermore, this release represents in most cases the commitment step for the full activation of the cell death program (17Green D.R. Reed J.C.

The several forms of PKD include autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is one of the most common inherited human disorders (∼1 per 500 worldwide). Affected individuals typically develop large cystic kidneys, but hepatic cysts, intracranial aneurysms, and cardiac valvular abnormalities are extra-renal manifestations often associated with this disorder. Approximately half of ADPKD patients develop end stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy and compose ∼5% of the chronic dialysis population in the United States (reviewed in Refs. 1Calvet J.P.

The genetic defect in >85% of ADPKD cases is mutations inPKD1, a gene that encodes a transcript of 14 kilobases from 46 exons spanning 50 kbp on chromosome 16p13.3 (6European Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium, Cell, 77, 1994, 881, 894.Google Scholar). The 5′ portion of the gene (exons 1–34) is duplicated with more than 95% homology in at least three other copies on chromosome 16p13.1, from which transcripts of 20, 17, and 8.5 kilobases are released (7International Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium, Cell, 81, 1995, 289, 298.Google Scholar, 8American PKD1 Consortium.Hum.

Polycystin-1, the product of PKD1, is thought to be involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (9Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Bukanov N.O. Donohue L.C. Dackowski W.R. Klinger K., W. Landes G.M.

Genotypic analyses of PKD1 microsatellite markers revealed that cysts originate from a single cell that, in a number of cases, underwent loss of heterozygosity. These results led to the proposal that cysts form by a “two-hit” process including a germ line mutation and a subsequent somatic mutation on the functional allele leading to loss of function (13Koptides M.

The rate of somatic mutations must be high given the frequent occurrence of ADPKD and the very large number of cysts observed, suggesting the existence of a local hot spot for mutagenesis. The identification of mutations inPKD1 has been hampered by the presence of the homologous genes; several of the 92 mutations identified so far are confined to the 3′-unduplicated region.

This poly(R·Y) tract is 66% G·C-rich with 95% C + T in the sense strand and is partly repeated in introns 1 and 22. These poly(R·Y) sequences, which are also present in the PKD1-like homologues, have been proposed to contribute to the high mutation rate of PKD1(17Watnick T.J. Piontek K.B. Cordal T.M. Weber H.

A computer search of the 2.5-kbp R·Y sequence revealed 23 mirror repeat sequences, which would be expected to adopt three-stranded DNA structures (intramolecular triplexes) (16Van Raay T.J. Burn T.C.

Also, 163 direct repeat sequences were identified, which may adopt slipped, mispaired conformations (16Van Raay T.J. Burn T.C. Connors T.D. Petri L.R. Germino G.G. Klinger K.W. Landes G.M. Microb.

Springer-Verlag, New York1988Crossref Google Scholar). Herein, the growth rates of various repair and DNA topological mutant strains of Escherichia coli that harbored plasmids containing the 2.5-kbp poly(R·Y) tract from intron 21 were analyzed. Unusual intramolecular DNA conformations, formed under the influence of negative supercoiling, induced the SOS system and were recognized as lesions by the NER pathway. Delays in cell division were observed as well as loss of the plasmid, suggesting that such DNA conformations were substrates for strand breaks and endonuclease activities. JTT1 ((gal-25, λ − , pyrF287, fnr-1, rpsL195(strR), iclR7(Const),trpR72(Am)), RS2:JTT1 (topA10), and SD7:JTT1 (topA10, gyrB226) were obtained from the E. coliGenetic Stock Center at Yale University (New Haven, CT). Strains KMBL1001 (no known mutations), CS5428:KMBL1001 (ΔuvrA::cam), CS5429:KMBL1001 (ΔuvrB::cam), CS5430:KMBL1001 (ΔuvrC::cam), and CS5431:KMBL1001 (ΔuvrD::tet) (24Moolenaar G.F. Moorman C. Goosen N. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5706-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Nora Goosen (Leiden Institute of Chemistry, The Netherlands). Strains JJC123 (GY6781; λ [sfiA::lacZ],Δpro-lac, gal +,rpsL, mal::Tn9, LexAind1), JJC510 (GY4786; λ [p(sfiA::lacZ)CIind − ] Δlac-pro,rpsL), and JJC523 (GY5425; recA441, sulA II, ΔlacI169, thi, leuB6,his4, argE3, ilvTS, galK2,rpsL37, lexA71::Tn5) were kind gifts of Dr. Benedicte Michel (Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, France). The cloning of pBS4.0 was reported (16Van Raay T.J. Burn T.C. Connors T.D. Petri L.R. Germino G.G. Klinger K.W. Landes G.M. Microb. Comp. Genom. 1996; 1: 317-327PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids containing truncations at the 5′-end of the 2.5-kbp poly(R·Y) tract were constructed and sequenced by treating pBS4.0 with exonuclease III (Erase-A-base kit, Promega, Madison, WI). The cleavage products were subcloned in pGem-T (Promega), excised asKpnI-SacI fragments, and finally directionally cloned into pBluescript KS− (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Six clones were selected for further study, pBS1.8, pBS1.5, pBS1.4, pBS1.3, pBS1.0, and pBS0.8, where the numerals indicate the size of theKpnI-SacI insert (Fig. 2 A). The identity of these clones was verified by DNA sequencing (see legend to Fig. 2 A). Like pBS4.0, pSPL3 (GenBankTMaccession number U19867) is derived from pBluescript and contains, in addition to the vector backbone, coding sequences for the human immunodeficiency virus envelope protein gp160 used for exon trapping (Life Technologies, Inc.). Novobiocin (Sigma), netropsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and actinomycin D (Sigma) were dissolved in buffer A (0.1 mNaCl, 1 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.4) at ≈10 mg/ml, and their concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically from their extinction coefficients (ε307 = 6 × 103(25Budavari S. The Merck Index. Merck & Co., Rahway, NJ1989Google Scholar), ε293 = 2.02 × 104 (26Wartell R.M. Larson J.E. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6719-6731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ε244 = 2.81 × 104 (25Budavari S. The Merck Index. Merck & Co., Rahway, NJ1989Google Scholar)), respectively. E. coli strains were transformed with plasmids by the CaCl2 method (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and selected on agar plates containing ampicillin (Ap). In all experiments that involved Ap, 100 μg/ml were used. Isolated colonies (one or more depending on size) were transferred to 10 ml of LB medium with Ap and grown to anA600 of ≈0.8–1.1. The number of viable colony-forming units (CFU) from such cultures (“founder cells”) was determined by plating dilutions on agar plates without Ap, during which time the 10-ml cultures were kept at 4 °C. This time varied from 1 to 5 days. Control experiments indicated that during this storage time the number of CFU decreased by an average of 33 ± 19%. A known number of CFU was then inoculated into triple-baffled 2-liter fermentation flasks with 1 liter of LB medium pre-warmed to 37 °C, and Ap was added. These flasks were shaken at 250 rpm at 37 °C, and 5–10-ml aliquots were withdrawn after 5 min (t0) and subsequently at every 15–30 min for 8–10 h. To determine the number of CFU/ml, the aliquots were diluted in LB and plated on agar plates without Ap. The following parameters were determined for each growth curve. The doubling time (t2) during the exponential phase of growth was obtained from the relation t2 = ln 2/k, where k was the slope as shown in Equation1, lnCFU/ml=ln(CFU/ml)0+ktEquation 1 The standard error of t2(Et2) was derived from the standard error of k (Ek) according toEt2 =t2 Ek/k. During the first few hours of growth, the number of CFU/ml either decreased or increased non-exponentially. These data were fit by high degree polynomials.MDC was obtained by dividing the CFU/ml at time 0 ((CFU/ml)t0) by the CFU/ml at the curve minimum ((CFU/ml)t(min)). When there was no decrease in CFU/ml, (CFU/ml)t(min) = (CFU/ml)t0 and MDC = 1. We define tA as the time it would have taken for the bacterial population to reach (CFU/ml)t0 if it grew exponentially from the theoretical (CFU/ml)0 given by Equation 1. Accordingly,tA = ln((CFU/ml)t0/(CFU/ml)0)/k. The following relations were used to analyze the superhelical density of plasmids. For relaxed, circular DNALk0 = Tw0 +Wr0, where Tw0 =n/h 0, n is the total number of bp andh 0 the helical pitch. Addition of a ligand that binds DNA and altersh 0 (twist) gives Lk0t +Wr0t under conditions where DNA is relaxed (i.e. by topoisomerase I). Subsequent ligand removal in the absence of strand breakage yieldsLk0t = Tw0 +Wrt, where Wrt =Wr0 + τt, and τt is the number of ligand-induced superhelical turns. For an in vivopopulation of negatively supercoiled topological isomers, <Lk> = Tw0 + <Wr> (<Wr> = Wr0 + <τ>, where τ is the number of negative supercoils). Addition of a ligand in vivo in the presence of homeostatic control of negative supercoiling, followed by its removal in the absence of strand breaks, yields <Lk> = Tw0 + <Wrt>. This population of topoisomers will have, on average, fewer negative supercoils when the ligand increases twist and more negative supercoils when the ligand decreases twist (28Sinden R.R. DNA Structure and Function. Academic Press, San Diego1994Google Scholar, 29Cozzarelli N.R. Boles T.C. White J.H. Cozzarelli N.R. Wang J.C. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 139-184Google Scholar). A previous computer search performed on the 2.5-kbp poly(R·Y) identified the presence of 23 perfect mirror repeats, which can form DNA triple helices (16Van Raay T.J. Burn T.C. Connors T.D. Petri L.R. Germino G.G. Klinger K.W. Landes G.M. Microb. Comp. Genom. 1996; 1: 317-327PubMed Google Scholar). We find that these motifs are clustered into three distinct regions separated by ∼600 and 450 bp, respectively (Fig.1). A search for perfect tandem repeats (30Benson G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar), which will form slipped structures (31Rosche W.A. Trinh T.Q. Sinden R.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4385-4391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Trinh T.Q. Sinden R.R. Genetics. 1993; 134: 409-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), revealed more than a thousand. The dinucleotides, TC and CT (row a), are most common; however, they are excluded from the 5′-end where the mirror repeats predominate. These dinucleotides are found with increasing frequency toward the 3′-end. The trinucleotide repeats are mostly CCT and are localized within the 5′-half of the tract, with the exclusion of the very 5′-end (row b). Pentanucleotide repeats are of three types as follows: CTCCC, CTCCT, and CCCAT. The first type (row c) can be further subdivided into three clusters according to the following reading frames: 8 CTCCC tandem repeat units (TRU) at the 5′-end, 5 CCTCC TRU in the middle, and a cluster of 19 TCCCC TRU at the 3′-end. The CTCCT direct repeats are positioned exclusively in the middle of the tract, interspersed by a single CCCAT tandem repeat (row d). Longer direct repeats are common as shown inrow e. The tract also contains close runs of guanines throughout its length that may form four-stranded structures (G-quartets) (33Gilbert D.E. Feigon J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In summary, although many mirror and direct repeats are present, their locations are clustered, suggesting highly specific evolutionary duplication events. To the best of our knowledge, this tract contains the highest density of unorthodox simple sequence repeat features (mirror, direct repeats, and R·Y strand bias) of any known sequence of this length. Previous analyses revealed that under superhelical stress the 2.5-kbp poly(R·Y) tract was cleaved by the single-stranded specific nuclease P1 at four locations, suggesting the formation of unusual structures (19Blaszak R.T. Potaman V. Sinden R.R. Bissler J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2610-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The location of the four P1 nuclease-sensitive sites is not coincident with the position of the direct repeats with ≤5 bp (Fig.1); however, sites 1 and 2 do superimpose with clusters of overlapping mirror repeats, as well as with two of the longest direct repeats. This suggests that the unusual DNA structures formed by the poly(R·Y) sequence in vitro include intramolecular triplexes and mispaired loops. To determine whether such structures form and influence cell physiology, we investigated the effect of the full-length tract and its truncations (Fig. 2 A) on the growth rate of wild-type E. coli KMBL1001. Fig. 2 B shows the normalized growth curves obtained with each of the plasmids. The doubling time was lengthened in proportion with the length of the inserts from 21.9 min for pBS0.8 to 24.4 min for pBS4.0. Four plasmids (pBS4.0, pBS1.8, pBS1.5, and pBS0.8) caused a decrease in CFU/ml during the first few hours of growth (Fig. 2 B, inset). This loss of viable cells was largest for pBS4.0 that had the full-length poly(R·Y) tract, and it decreased in proportion to the length of the inserts. Finally, the duration of the non-exponential phase of growth (lag period) also lengthened in accordance with the increasing insert lengths, from 0.8 h for pBS0.8 to 1.8 h for pBS4.0. Thus, we conclude that the poly(R·Y) sequence compromised the viability of a number of cells in a length-dependent manner and contributed to the lengthening of the population doubling time as well as the lag period, suggesting that the magnitude of these effects correlated with the number of unusual DNA structures that formed. To identify genetic factors associated with cell death, growth curves were determined for E. coli mutant strains that affected DNA supercoil density, nucleotide excision repair (NER), and DNA damage-induced SOS response (Table I). The parameters (MDC, t2, andtA) obtained in E. coli strains harboring pBS4.0 were compared with those obtained for pSPL3, a control chosen because of its size (6.0 versus 7.0 kbp for pBS4.0), the absence of long repetitive sequences, and because, like pBS4.0, it was a derivative of pBluescript.Table IE. coli strainsStrainGenotypeRelevant featuresJTT1gal-25, λ−, pyrF287, fnr-1, rpsL195(strR),iclR7(Const), trpR72(Am)Wild typeRS2JTT1 except topA10∼15% more negatively supercoiled than JTT1SD7JTT1 except topA10, gyrB226∼10% less negatively supercoiled than JTT1KMBL1001Wild typeCS5428KMBL1001 exceptuvrA∷camDeficient in helicase activities in NERCS5429KMBL1001 exceptuvrB∷camDeficient in helicase and endonuclease activities in NERCS5430KMBL1001 exceptuvrC∷camDeficient in endonuclease activity in NERCS5431KMBL1001 exceptuvrD∷tetDeficient in helicase activity; constitutive induction of SOS responseJJC510λ[p(sfiA∷lacZ)CIind −], Δlac-pro, rpsLWild typeJJC123JJC510 exceptmal∷Tn9, gal+, lexAind1Non-cleavable LexA repressor; non-inducible SOS responseJJC523recA441, lexA71∷Tn5Constitutive induction of SOS response Open table in a new tab The results (Table II) reveal the following. First, the extent of cell loss mediated by pBS4.0 correlated with the steady-state level of negative supercoiling (as determinedin vivo for pUC19, not shown) because the magnitude ofMDC followed the order topA10 >wt > topA10gyrB226. Since the number and stability of underwound unusual DNA structures increase with the extent of negative supercoiling (20Sinden R.R. Pearson C.E. Potaman V.N. Ussery D.W. Verma R.S. 1st Ed.

Furthermore, the differences in doubling time between pSPL3 and pBS4.0 in the three top/gyr strains (15.3, 9.3, and 5.4 min, respectively) also depended upon negative supercoiling, suggesting that the formation of unusual DNA structures interfered with cell division.Table IIParameters for the growth curvesE. colistrainpBS4.0pSPL3MDCt2tAMDCt2tAminhminhJTT1 (wt)277831.88.91.222.51.2RS2 (topA10)500442.312.43.127.02.4SD7 (topA10, gyrB226)23832.88.21.127.40.9KMBL1001 (wt)47724.17.2121.11.6CS5428 (ΔuvrA)10121.83.715.822.42.4CS5429 (ΔuvrB)120.81.11.122.31.4CS5430 (ΔuvrC)3.423.73.1120.31.5CS5431 (ΔuvrD)62626.36.217120.84.6JJC510 (wt)10.021.63.13.321.71.5JJC123 (lexAind1)26.838.95.3129.11.1JJC523 (recA441, ΔlexA71)3.6 2-aSignificant cell lysis was observed.30.74.12.125.61.9MDC = maximum fold decrease in CFU/ml (MDC = 1, no decrease in CFU/ml); t2= doubling time during exponential growth; tA = lag period (time required to reach the equivalent of initial CFU/ml for exponential growth extrapolated to time = 0).

The standard error for t2 ranged from 0.3 to 3.7 min. The variations inMDC and tA are discussed under “Results.” Second, E. coli NER mutants revealed that UvrB and UvrC were necessary for the loss of cells. In fact, the MDC was negligible for both ΔuvrB and ΔuvrC strains compared with their isogenic wild-type KMBL1001. In addition, for ΔuvrB there was no lengthening of the doubling time, whereas ΔtA was shortened to ∼15 min from ≥1.3 h observed for all the other strains. The second significant result from this analysis was the considerable loss of cells in the ΔuvrA and ΔuvrD strains harboring only the control plasmid pSPL3. Because deficiency in UvrD is known to lead to constitutive expression of the SOS response (36George J.W. Brosh R.M.J. Matson S.W. J. Mol.

Third, we investigated the E. coli SOS strains. During the preparation of JJC523 (ΔlexA71) “founder cells” harboring pBS4.0, we observed significant cell lysis that yielded ∼1 × 105 CFU/ml from overnight cultures compared with >1 × 107 obtained normally with the same strain harboring pSPL3 or all the other strains with either pBS4.0 or pSPL3. This result clearly indicates that pBS4.0 caused extensive cell death when associated with a fully active SOS response. The growth curve started from the surviving cells did not show a large decrease in cell count. The MDC value with pBS4.0 for the wild-type JJC510 was much lower than for the other two wild-type strains, JTT1 and KMBL1001. We observed that the values of MDC (and thereforetA) for the three wild-type strains, fortopA10, and for topA10gyrB226, varied"

Grancalcin belongs to the penta-EF-hand subfamily of EF-hand proteins, which also comprises calpain, sorcin, peflin, and ALG-2. Penta-EF-hand members are typified by two novel types of EF-hands: one that binds Ca2+ although it has an unusual Ca2+ coordination loop and one that does not bind Ca2+ but is directly involved in homodimerization. We have developed a novel method for purification of native grancalcin and found that the N terminus of wild-type grancalcin is acetylated. This posttranslational modification does not affect the secondary structure or conformation of the protein. We found that both native and recombinant grancalcin always exists as a homodimer, regardless of the Ca2+ load. Flow dialysis showed that recombinant grancalcin binds two Ca2+ per subunit with positive cooperativity and moderate affinity ([Ca2+]0.5 of 25 and 83 μm in the presence and absence of octyl glycoside, respectively) and that the sites are of the Ca2+-specific type. Furthermore, we showed, by several independent methods, that grancalcin undergoes important conformational changes upon binding of Ca2+ and subsequently exposes hydrophobic amino acid residues, which direct the protein to hydrophobic surfaces. By affinity chromatography of solubilized human neutrophils on immobilized grancalcin, L-plastin, a leukocyte-specific actin-bundling protein, was found to interact with grancalcin in a negative Ca2+-dependent manner.

From amino acid sequence comparison, it was initially deduced that these proteins possess four EF-hand motifs (6Nakayama S. Kretsinger R.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 473-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, recent studies on the three-dimensional structure of dVI, the Ca2+-binding domain of calpain light chain (7Lin G. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K.W. Carson M. Jin L. Yuen P. Takano E. Hatanaka M. DeLucas L.J. Narayana S.V.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 8Blanchard H. Grochulski P. Li Y. Arthur S.C. Davis P.L. Elce J.S. Cygler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), surprisingly revealed the presence of a fifth EF-hand N-terminal to the previously identified EF-hands. This EF-hand is of a novel type and has therefore escaped detection by sequence similarity analysis. This group of proteins is thus characterized by five EF-hands and has accordingly been named the penta-EF-hand (PEF)1subfamily (4Maki M. Narayana S.V.L. Hitomi K Biochem. J. 2017; : 718-720Google Scholar). In addition, the members of the PEF subfamily contain N termini of varying length and sequence but all rich in glycine and hydrophobic residues. In calpain, EF1 (although of an unusual sequence composition) and EF2 are paired and bind two Ca2+ with high affinity. EF3 and EF4 are also paired and possess one site of high affinity and one of low affinity for Ca2+. Finally, EF5, which does not bind Ca2+, is paired with a similar EF5 of another monomer and is thus a dimerization module. Native calpain is a heterodimer of the calpain light and heavy chain (9Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The recent crystallization of apograncalcin (10Han Q. Jia J. Li Y. Lollike K. Cygler M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2000; 56: 772-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 11Jia J. Han Q. Borregaard N. Lollike K. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) has shown great overall similarity to the crystal structure of calpain. Grancalcin was also found to form dimers by paring of cognate EF5s. Unfortunately, grancalcin precipitated in the presence of Ca2+ and the topology of active Ca2+-binding sites could not be determined, except for binding of Ca2+ to EF3 from one monomer. Moreover, the N terminus of grancalcin is disordered in the crystals, and the first well defined residue is Ser53. In molecular sieve chromatography, purified grancalcin migrates as a homodimer (1Teahan C.G. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and ALG-2 as a monomer (12Maki M. Yamaguchi K. Kitaura Y. Satoh H. Hitomi K. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Lo K.W.H. Zhang Q. Li M. Zhang M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7498-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, when using a chemical cross-linker, ALG-2 could be shown to exist also as a dimer (13Lo K.W.H. Zhang Q. Li M. Zhang M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7498-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The cDNA for grancalcin is 1.65 kilobase pairs long and contains an open reading frame for 217 amino acids; the first 14 amino acids have been reported to be removed posttranslationally to give rise to a 203-residue-long functional protein (2Boyhan A. Casimir C.M. French J.K. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2928-2933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This presumably functional grancalcin has a calculated molecular mass of 22.4 kDa, while grancalcin migrates as a 28-kDa protein in SDS-PAGE (1Teahan C.G. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Boyhan A. Casimir C.M. French J.K. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2928-2933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy is unknown, but it is not due to glycosylation (1Teahan C.G. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Grancalcin translocates to membranes upon binding of Ca2+ (2Boyhan A. Casimir C.M. French J.K. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2928-2933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lollike K. Sørensen O. Bundgaard J.R. Segal A.W. Boyhan A. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 185: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 14Borregaard N. Kjeldsen L. Lollike K. Sengeløv H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This is a common feature of several EF-hand proteins. Translocation is often mediated by exposure of hydrophobic patches of amino acids subsequent to Ca2+binding, as is the case for calpain (15Takeyama Y. Nakizishi H. Uratsuji Y. Kishimoto A. Nishizuka Y. FEBS Lett. 1986; 194: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and calretinin (16Winsky L. Kuznicki J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In other instances, such as in the recoverin family, a covalently bound fatty acid becomes exposed after Ca2+-induced conformational changes, and this leads to translocation of the protein to membranes, a mechanism also called the myristoyl switch (17Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Which of these molecular schemes prevails for grancalcin is at present unknown. EF-hand proteins have affinities for Ca2+ varying from 108 to 103m−1. Moreover, some show great selectivity toward Ca2+, such as calmodulin, S100 proteins, and calretinin, whereas others also bind Mg2+, such as parvalbumin and recoverin (for a review, see Ref. 18Cox J.A. Celio M.R. Pauls T. Schwaller B. Guidebook to the calcium-binding Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 1-12Google Scholar). Neither the affinity nor the selectivity can be deduced from the sequence of the EF-hands. Except for a positive 45Ca2+ overlay, no information on the ion-binding and conformational changes of grancalcin is available. Because the biochemical characterization of grancalcin has been very sparse and nothing is known about the function of grancalcin, we decided to address these issues. In this report, we have identified a N-terminal posttranslational modification of wild-type grancalcin by mass spectroscopy and sequencing. Because grancalcin precipitates in the presence of Ca2+ in most experiments, we have generated three mutants of grancalcin with varying N-terminal deletions. We show that these mutants do not precipitate to the same degree as recombinant grancalcin. We have also compared critical properties of wild type and recombinant grancalcin, determined the binding characteristics of grancalcin for Ca2+ by flow dialysis, and probed cation induced conformational changes by fluorometry of the intrinsic Trp residues. Finally, using affinity chromatography, we identify the actin-bundling protein L-plastin as binding partner of grancalcin and document the Ca2+ dependence of this interaction. Human neutrophils were isolated from volunteer donors as described (19Boyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1968; 21: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). In short, erythrocytes were sedimented by 2% dextran (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in saline, and the leukocyte-rich supernatant was submitted to 400 × g density centrifugation for 30 min on Lymphoprep (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway). The pellet was submitted to hypotonic lysis of contaminating erythrocytes for 30 s in pure water, after which tonicity was restored by the addition of NaCl. The neutrophils were washed once, counted, and resuspended in saline. SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting (21Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44841) Google Scholar) were performed on Bio-Rad systems according to the instructions given by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad) and as described (3Lollike K. Sørensen O. Bundgaard J.R. Segal A.W. Boyhan A. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 185: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), except for visualization of immunoblots, which was by metal-enhanced diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Pierce). Crude protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford according to the instructions given by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad), and catalase ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 mg/ml was used as a standard. Grancalcin was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as previously described (3Lollike K. Sørensen O. Bundgaard J.R. Segal A.W. Boyhan A. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 185: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Purified grancalcin was quantified by the ultraviolet absorption spectrum using a molar extinction coefficient ε278 nm of 28,000m−1cm−1. Isolated neutrophils at 3 × 107 cells/ml were incubated in saline with 5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate (Sigma) for 5 min on ice and centrifuged at 200 × g for 6 min. Cell pellets were resuspended at 2 × 108 cells/ml in binding buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 10 mm PIPES (pH 7.2)) containing 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 units/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml leupeptin (all three Sigma-Aldrich) and disrupted by nitrogen cavitation at 400 p.s.i. for 5 min at 4 °C as described (22Borregaard N. Heiple J.M. Simons E.R. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The cavitate was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min, and the supernatant was kept as cytosol. Human neutrophil cytosol (prepared as above) in binding buffer plus 0.5 mm CaCl2 was purified on a self-packaged phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column at room temperature. After binding of cytosolic proteins, the column was washed thoroughly in binding buffer plus 0.5 mm CaCl2. Bound proteins were eluted in fractions of 2 ml with binding buffer plus 5 mm EGTA. Fractions containing grancalcin (as determined by SDS-PAGE) were submitted to a buffer change to 20 mm Trizma (pH 7.4) using a Centriprep column (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and passed through a Mono-Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column coupled to an FPLC instrument (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound proteins were eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl nonlinear gradient, and 0.5-ml fractions were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Recombinant grancalcin was produced and purified as previously described (3Lollike K. Sørensen O. Bundgaard J.R. Segal A.W. Boyhan A. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 185: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). N-terminal deletion mutants were cloned from the grancalcin clone using the following primers for the N terminus: Δ42-grancalcin, 5′-CGC GGA TCC GCA TAT TCA GAC ACT TAT TCC-3′; Δ50-grancalcin, 5′-CGC GGA TCC GCT GGT GAC TCC GTG TAT AC-3′; and Δ53-grancalcin, 5′-CGC GGA TCC TCC GTG TAT ACT TTC AGT G-3′. For all three mutants, the following primer was used for the C terminus: 5′-CCG GAA TTC TCA AAT TGC CAT AGT GCC CTG C-3′. The obtained clones and the vector (pGEX2T (Pharmacia Amersham Biotech)) were cut with BamHI and EcoRI and, following ligation, transformed into Escherichia coli. The expressed clones were checked by sequencing (model 377 DNASequencer (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA)), and only clones with correct sequences were used for protein expression. Procedures for expression and purification of N-terminal deletion mutants were as described for recombinant grancalcin (3Lollike K. Sørensen O. Bundgaard J.R. Segal A.W. Boyhan A. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 185: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For the identification of the N-terminal modification in wild type grancalcin, 20 μg of both wild type and recombinant grancalcin was incubated with 0.5 μg of endoproteinase Glu-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 500 μl 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8) including 10% acetonitrile for 20 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml 1% trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting fragments were purified by HPLC on a 2.1 × 150-mm C-4 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) eluted with a linear gradient (1% per min) from solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). Peak fractions were collected manually. The putative N-terminal fragment was localized by mass spectrometry, dried, and submitted to cleavage with 0.1 μg of thermolysin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 100 μl of buffer (100 mm NH4HCO3, 5 mmCaCl2 (pH 7.8) including 10% actonitrile) for 3 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting fragments were purified by HPLC on a 2.1 × 150-mm C-8 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) as described above. The purified peptides were analyzed in a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Biflex, Bruker-Franzen, Bremen, Germany). For analysis, 0.5 μl of the sample was mixed with 0.5 μl of matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetonitrile/methanol; Hewlett Packard), and 0.5 μl of the mixture was applied to the probe and allowed to dry. The purified proteins (wild-type grancalcin and recombinant grancalcin) were diluted 4–10 times with a 20 mm octyl-β-glucopyranoside (OG) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) solution in formic acid/H2O/acetonitrile (1:3:2, by volume) before mixing with the matrix. Most samples were analyzed in the positive mode. Spectra were recorded for 20–100 laser shots. The method has an accuracy of 0.1%. The amino acid sequences of the purified peptides were determined employing an automatic protein sequencer (model 494A; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with an online HPLC system for detection of the amino acid-phenylthiohydantoin derivatives. All chemicals and solvents were sequence or HPLC grade supplied by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 200 μl of recombinant protein (10 μm) or cytosol in binding buffer with or without 0.5 mm Ca2+ was applied to a Superdex 75 column (FPLC system; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in binding buffer with or without 0.5 mm Ca2+, and eluted fractions were analyzed by absorbance and/or grancalcin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The following markers were used to calibrate the column: blue dextran 2000 (>2,000,000), ribonuclease A (13,700), chymotrypsinogen A (25,000), and ovalbumin (43,000). Proteins were cross-linked with the chemical cross-linker DSG (Pierce) essentially as described (13Lo K.W.H. Zhang Q. Li M. Zhang M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7498-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In short, proteins were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 100 μl of cross-linking buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 ml of dithiothreitol) to which 5 μl of DSG was added (from 10 mm stock in N, N-dimethylformamide). The reaction was quenched by the addition of 125 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and cross-linking was evaluated by immunoblotting. Recombinant grancalcin at 2 or 10 μm and Δ42-grancalcin and Δ53-grancalcin at 10 μm in binding buffer (with or without 25 mm OG) were supplemented with varying concentrations of Ca2+ and rotated end over end for 30 min at room temperature. The tubes were centrifuged at 14,800 × gfor 5 min. at 4 °C, and the supernatants were assayed by absorption to determine protein concentrations. Since the method of trichloroacetic acid precipitation (14Borregaard N. Kjeldsen L. Lollike K. Sengeløv H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) irreversibly modified the Trp fluorescence spectra of grancalcin, the concentrated protein sample was supplemented with 1 mm EGTA, dialyzed overnight against buffer A containing 0.1 mm EGTA, and passed through a Sephadex G25 column (0.8 × 40 cm) equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl). The protein contained less than 0.1 mol of Ca2+/mol. Ca2+ binding was measured on the recombinant protein at 25 °C by the flow dialysis method (23Colowick S.P. Womack F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 774-777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in buffer A. Protein concentrations were 25 μm. Processing of data and evaluation of the binding constants were as described (18Cox J.A. Celio M.R. Pauls T. Schwaller B. Guidebook to the calcium-binding Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 1-12Google Scholar). Emission fluorescence spectra were obtained in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-5B spectrofluorometer. The measurements were carried out at 25 °C on 4 μm wild-type or recombinant grancalcin in buffer A in the presence of 37.5 mm OG with an excitation wavelength at 278 nm and both slits at 5 nm. Measurements were performed in the presence of either 50 μm EGTA, 0.5 mmCaCl2 or 4 m guanidine-HCl, respectively. Recombinant grancalcin at 1 mg/ml in the presence of 0.5 mm CaCl2 or 0.5 mm EGTA was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose™ according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Three columns were packaged: one containing recombinant grancalcin in the presence of Ca2+, one containing recombinant grancalcin without calcium, and one without any protein present. Purified human neutrophils at 3 × 107 cells/ml were solubilized in solubilization buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 25 mm OG, 0.2% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 units/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μm EGTA) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Unsolubilized material were spun down (5000 × g for 10 min), and 10 ml of supernatant, supplemented with 0.5 mm EGTA, were applied to each to each of the three columns. The columns were washed extensively in binding buffer plus 0.5 mm EGTA, and bound proteins were eluted with binding buffer plus 5 mm CaCl2. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Fractions with a visible protein band were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The identified band was cut out of the SDS gel and digested with trypsin essentially as described by Wilm et al. (24Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). In short, the gel piece was cut into small cubes and washed for 1 h in 100 mmNH4HCO3 (AB), and excess liquid was removed. Then the proteins were reduced for 30 min at 60 °C in 100 μl of 4 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm AB, cooled, and alkylated by the addition of 10 μl of 100 mmiodoacetamide followed by a 30-min incubation at room temperature in the dark. Excess liquid was removed, and the gel pieces were washed for 1 h in 50% acetonitrile in 100 mm AB followed by shrinkage in acetonitrile and vacuum centrifugation. The tube with the dry gel pieces was placed in an ice bath and allowed to swell in 25 mm AB including 2 μg/100 μl modified trypsin (Promega). After 45 min, the excess liquid was removed, and buffer was added to cover the gel pieces during overnight incubation at 37 °C. The next day, the liquid was removed and combined with two consecutive extractions with 50 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile. The extract was dried in a vacuum centrifuge to near dryness followed by the addition of 5 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 30% acetonitrile. For analysis, 0.4 μl of the sample was mixed with 0.1 μl of internal standard mixture (angiotensin II and dynorphin, 0.06 and 1 pmol/μl, respectively) and 0.5 μl matrix solution (α-cyano-4 hydroxycinnamic acid) and measured by mass spectrometry as described above, except the instrument was upgraded with the time lag focusing option (delayed extraction). The peptide molecular mass fingerprint was used for a search of the SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL data base using the “PeptIdent” tool on the ExPASy Molecular Biology Server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (25Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Cytosol from human neutrophils (prepared as described above) was diluted with binding buffer to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml (as determined by Bio-Rad). 5 μl of anti-grancalcin or anti-L-plastin antibodies (two different antibodies; LPL4A1, which binds to L-plastin irrespective of Ca2+ load, and LPL7,2, which only binds to the Ca2+-loaded form of L-plastin (described in Ref. 26Jones S.L. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14623-14630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a kind gift from Dr. Eric J. Brown (Division of Infectious Disease, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, St. Louis, MO)) were added to 1 ml of the diluted cytosol in the presence of 0.5 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA, respectively. The solution were rotated end over end overnight at 4 °C. Next, 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose® beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (prepared in binding buffer as described by the manufacturer) were added, and the slurry was rotated end over end for 2 h at 4 °C. The tubes were centrifuged to pellet beads, and the supernatant was gently removed. The pellets were washed three times in binding buffer with either 0.5 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA present before reconstitution into the initial volume. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described above. For immunoblotting with L-plastin and MRP14 antibodies, the following dilutions were used: LPL4A1 primary antibody, 1:1000; secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse (D0486) (Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark), 1:1000; LPL7,2 primary antibody, 1:1000; secondary antibody (rabbit anti-rat (P0450) (Dako A/S), 1:1000; MRP14 primary antibody (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland), 1:2000 (biotinylated); secondary layer (avidine horseradish peroxidase (P0347) (Dako A/S)), 1:1000. One aim of this study was to determine if native grancalcin has a lipid anchor or other posttranslational modifications. Furthermore, we wanted to verify the reported N terminus of grancalcin. Since many EF-hand proteins expose hydrophobic areas upon binding of Ca2+, we tested if grancalcin also becomes hydrophobic in the presence of high concentrations of Ca2+. Human neutrophil cytosol was passed through a phenyl-Sepharose column in the presence of 0.5 mm Ca2+, and the column was washed with Ca2+ buffer. Replacement of Ca2+ by an excess of EGTA led to elution of a limited number of proteins (Fig. 1 A). By Coomassie staining, several bands can be seen, which all are expected to be Ca2+-binding proteins or proteins that interact with Ca2+-binding proteins. Indeed, several well known Ca2+-binding proteins could be identified (data not shown). The band at 28 kDa, showing retarded EGTA elution, was identified as grancalcin by immunoblotting. Fractions containing grancalcin were further purified by anion-exchange chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This resulted in pure grancalcin as evaluated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig.1 B). Thus, we here present a novel and fast protocol for purification of grancalcin from the cytosol of human neutrophils, based on its Ca2+-dependent binding to a hydrophobic matrix. Recombinant grancalcin was produced and purified as described (3Lollike K. Sørensen O. Bundgaard J.R. Segal A.W. Boyhan A. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 185: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The grancalcin clone was checked by conventional sequencing techniques and found to be identical with the published (2Boyhan A. Casimir C.M. French J.K. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2928-2933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) sequence (data not shown). Recombinant grancalcin is synthesized as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein linked by a cleavage site for thrombin and differs from prograncalcin (we use the term prograncalcin for the hypothetical protein corresponding to the coding sequence, including the N-terminal Met) by an additional Gly-Ser dipeptide at the N terminus, as was confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis (data not shown). The molecular mass of purified recombinant grancalcin was determined to be 24,124 Da, in good agreement with the theoretical mass of 24,154 Da. In order to solve solubility problems (see below), we also generated three mutants with varying deletions in the N terminus, named after the starting amino acid according to the nomenclature for prograncalcin: Δ42-grancalcin, Δ50-grancalcin, and Δ53-grancalcin, respectively. All three mutants were easily expressed and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity (Fig. 2) following the same procedure as for recombinant grancalcin. Our polyclonal (rabbit) anti-grancalcin antibodies reacted with all three mutants (data not shown). The purified wild-type grancalcin gave no signal in protein sequence analysis, indicating that the N terminus is blocked. Moreover, by mass spectrometry wild-type grancalcin was found to have a molecular mass of 23,856 Da as compared with 24,010 Da calculated for prograncalcin (hypothetical protein, corresponding to the coding sequence), suggesting that the N terminus of wild-type grancalcin is modified. Cleavage of wild-type grancalcin with endoproteina"
https://openalex.org/W1974172048,"Glycoprotein Ibα (GP Ibα), the ligand binding subunit of the platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex, is sulfated on three tyrosine residues (Tyr-276, Tyr-278, and Tyr-279). This posttranslational modification is known to be critical for von Willebrand factor (vWF) binding; yet it remains unclear whether it provides a specific structure or merely contributes negative charges. To investigate this issue, we constructed cell lines expressing GP Ibα polypeptides with the three tyrosine residues converted to either Glu or Phe and studied the ability of these mutants to bind vWF in the presence of modulators or shear stress. The mutants were expressed normally on the cell surface as GP Ib-IX complexes, with the conformation of the ligand-binding domain preserved, as judged by the binding of conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies. In contrast to their normal expression, both mutants were functionally abnormal. Cells expressing the Phe mutant failed to bind vWF in the presence of either ristocetin or botrocetin. These cells adhered to and rolled on immobilized vWF only when their surface receptor density was increased to twice the level that supported adhesion of cells expressing the wild-type receptor and even then only 20% as many rolled and rolled significantly faster than wild-type cells. Cells expressing the Glu mutant, on the other hand, were normal with respect to ristocetin-induced vWF binding and adhesion to immobilized vWF but were markedly defective in botrocetin-induced vWF binding. These results indicate that GP Ibα tyrosine sulfation influences the interaction of this polypeptide with vWF primarily by contributing negative charges under physiological conditions and when the interaction is induced by ristocetin but contributes a specific structure to the botrocetin-induced interaction. Glycoprotein Ibα (GP Ibα), the ligand binding subunit of the platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex, is sulfated on three tyrosine residues (Tyr-276, Tyr-278, and Tyr-279). This posttranslational modification is known to be critical for von Willebrand factor (vWF) binding; yet it remains unclear whether it provides a specific structure or merely contributes negative charges. To investigate this issue, we constructed cell lines expressing GP Ibα polypeptides with the three tyrosine residues converted to either Glu or Phe and studied the ability of these mutants to bind vWF in the presence of modulators or shear stress. The mutants were expressed normally on the cell surface as GP Ib-IX complexes, with the conformation of the ligand-binding domain preserved, as judged by the binding of conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies. In contrast to their normal expression, both mutants were functionally abnormal. Cells expressing the Phe mutant failed to bind vWF in the presence of either ristocetin or botrocetin. These cells adhered to and rolled on immobilized vWF only when their surface receptor density was increased to twice the level that supported adhesion of cells expressing the wild-type receptor and even then only 20% as many rolled and rolled significantly faster than wild-type cells. Cells expressing the Glu mutant, on the other hand, were normal with respect to ristocetin-induced vWF binding and adhesion to immobilized vWF but were markedly defective in botrocetin-induced vWF binding. These results indicate that GP Ibα tyrosine sulfation influences the interaction of this polypeptide with vWF primarily by contributing negative charges under physiological conditions and when the interaction is induced by ristocetin but contributes a specific structure to the botrocetin-induced interaction. von Willebrand factor Chinese hamster ovary α-minimal essential medium phosphate-buffered saline glycoprotein The platelet receptor for von Willebrand factor (vWF),1 the glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex, is composed of four polypeptide subunits (GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, GP IX, and GP V (1Berndt M.C.

Tyrosine sulfation could affect protein function in at least two ways; the sulfates could simply serve as an additional means of providing negative charges for electrostatic interactions or they could provide a specific structure for intra- or interpolypeptide interactions. To address the role of tyrosine sulfation in the interaction between vWF and GP Ibα, we established CHO cell lines that express GP Ibα mutants in which the three sulfated tyrosine residues were replaced by either Phe or Glu residues. In the Phe mutant, the negative charges contributed by sulfation are eliminated, whereas in the Glu mutant, the side chain is changed but the charge is maintained. Here we report findings on the effects of the mutations on cell surface expression of the GP Ib-IX complex, modulator-induced vWF binding, and on cell adhesion to immobilized vWF under fluid shear stress.DISCUSSIONTyrosine sulfation is a widespread posttranslational protein modification that occurs in the trans-Golgi compartment where it is catalyzed by the membrane-bound enzyme, aryl sulfotransferase (15Huttner W.B. Nature. 1982; 299: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar,35Huttner W.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 361-363Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 36Hortin G. Folz R.

Biochem. 1992; 24: 1349-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A large number of proteins have been found to contain this modification, but its functional role has only been demonstrated in a few cases (19Leyte A. van Schijndel H.B. Niehrs C. Huttner W.B.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Even with this, the mechanism of how sulfation affects protein function has not been addressed for GP Ibα and has only been addressed in one other case to our knowledge (40Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T. Cell. 2000; 103: 467-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The two most obvious means by which tyrosine sulfation may participate in protein function is by either providing or contributing to a specific structure (e.g.through folding) or by contributing negative charges. An alternative has been suggested by the work of Somers et al. (40Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T. Cell. 2000; 103: 467-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) who recently showed that the sulfated tyrosines of P-selection glycoprotein ligand-1 participate in calcium ion coordination when this protein binds its counter-receptor, P-selectin. In the current study we examined whether sulfate is specifically required for GP Ibα function or whether substituting another acidic residue for the sulfate will maintain vWF binding function. We addressed this issue by constructing cell lines expressing either wild-type GP Ibα or mutant receptors substituting the three tyrosines with either phenylalanine or glutamate residues. The Phe substitutions maintained the phenyl groups of the tyrosines but eliminated the p-hydroxy group, thereby preventing sulfation. The Glu substitutions, on the other hand, changed the side chains radically but preserved their net charge.Both mutants were expressed on the cell surface normally and retained the normal conformation of the GP Ibα N terminus, as determined by the binding of several conformation-sensitive antibodies. The monoclonal antibody SZ2 failed to bind both mutants because the anionic sulfated region constitutes its binding site (13Ward C.M. Andrews R.K. Smith A.I. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).Whether the mutations affected vWF binding depended on how that binding was induced. When vWF binding was induced by botrocetin, a snake venom protein known to bind vWF and alter its conformation, both mutants were found to be markedly defective (Fig. 4 lower). This is consistent with extensive previous work showing that the anionic sulfated site of GP Ibα is important in botrocetin-induced vWF binding and that even minor perturbations of this site can alter binding drastically (7López J.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 97-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 12Marchese P. Murata M. Mazzucato M. Pradella P. De Marco L. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol.

Andrews R.K. Blood. 2000; 95: 903-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, only the Phe mutant was defective when vWF binding was induced by ristocetin (Fig. 4 upper), a modulator that we have recently demonstrated to more closely mimic physiological vWF binding, i.e. binding induced by high shear stress or by vWF immobilization onto a surface (41Dong J.F. Berndt M.C. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Andrews R.K. López J. Blood. 2001; 97: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This defect in ristocetin-induced vWF binding was indeed mimicked by a defect in attachment of the cells to immobilized vWF in a flow chamber. At surface densities of the Phe mutant similar to those on wild-type cells that bound and rolled on the surface, cells expressing the mutant failed to attach to the surface. At roughly double those surface densities, the cells attached and a few rolled, but most of them translocated along the surface by saltation (Fig. 6). This is in contrast to the Glu mutants, which attached and rolled on the surface in a manner indistinguishable from the wild-type cells. Thus, with regard to the more physiological measures of GP Ibα's vWF binding function, substitution of the sulfated tyrosines with glutamic acid residues seems to fully maintain function.These results have several implications. First, they demonstrate that tyrosine sulfation influences the interaction between GP Ibα and vWF either by an electrostatic mechanism or by metal ion coordination, both of which can be replaced by the carboxylic acid-containing side chain of glutamic acid. Second, the correspondence between the effects of the mutations on shear-dependent vWF binding function and on ristocetin-induced vWF binding is consistent with our previous findings that ristocetin is a better mimic of the physiologic interaction than is botrocetin (41Dong J.F. Berndt M.C. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Andrews R.K. López J. Blood. 2001; 97: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The specific sequence is not as critical for ristocetin-induced binding as for botrocetin-induced binding, which is markedly perturbed by both the Phe and the Glu substitutions. The latter indicates that the anionic sulfated region of GP Ibα may constitute, at least partially, a direct site for botrocetin-induced vWF binding, with the sulfates being absolutely required for the interaction. Third, the results suggest that the three negative charges contributed by the sulfated tyrosines are important in maintaining the affinity of the GP Ibα-vWF interaction. The Phe mutants, lacking these negative charges, interact abnormally with immobilized vWF under conditions of flow, demonstrated by the presence of fewer rolling cells and by the fact that those cells that did adhere to the surface translocated by saltation rather than by continuous rolling (Figs. 5and 6). This defect was partially compensated by increasing the surface levels of the mutant receptor.In summary, we present evidence that sulfation of tyrosine residues within the anionic sulfated region of platelet GP Ibα contributes negative charges that are critical for the interaction of GP Ibα with vWF under flow and in the presence of ristocetin. Although charge rather than a specific sequence is important for these interactions, the same is not true for the interaction induced by botrocetin. Our results strongly support the notion that there is more than one binding site on GP Ibα for vWF and that the choice of that site depends on the means by which the interaction is induced. The platelet receptor for von Willebrand factor (vWF),1 the glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex, is composed of four polypeptide subunits (GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, GP IX, and GP V (1Berndt M.C. Gregory C.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).Whether the mutations affected vWF binding depended on how that binding was induced. When vWF binding was induced by botrocetin, a snake venom protein known to bind vWF and alter its conformation, both mutants were found to be markedly defective (Fig. 4 lower). This is consistent with extensive previous work showing that the anionic sulfated site of GP Ibα is important in botrocetin-induced vWF binding and that even minor perturbations of this site can alter binding drastically (7López J.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 97-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 12Marchese P. Murata M. Mazzucato M. Pradella P. De Marco L. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol.

Andrews R.K. Blood. 2000; 95: 903-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, only the Phe mutant was defective when vWF binding was induced by ristocetin (Fig. 4 upper), a modulator that we have recently demonstrated to more closely mimic physiological vWF binding, i.e. binding induced by high shear stress or by vWF immobilization onto a surface (41Dong J.F. Berndt M.C. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Andrews R.K. López J. Blood. 2001; 97: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This defect in ristocetin-induced vWF binding was indeed mimicked by a defect in attachment of the cells to immobilized vWF in a flow chamber. At surface densities of the Phe mutant similar to those on wild-type cells that bound and rolled on the surface, cells expressing the mutant failed to attach to the surface. At roughly double those surface densities, the cells attached and a few rolled, but most of them translocated along the surface by saltation (Fig. 6). This is in contrast to the Glu mutants, which attached and rolled on the surface in a manner indistinguishable from the wild-type cells. Thus, with regard to the more physiological measures of GP Ibα's vWF binding function, substitution of the sulfated tyrosines with glutamic acid residues seems to fully maintain function.These results have several implications. First, they demonstrate that tyrosine sulfation influences the interaction between GP Ibα and vWF either by an electrostatic mechanism or by metal ion coordination, both of which can be replaced by the carboxylic acid-containing side chain of glutamic acid. Second, the correspondence between the effects of the mutations on shear-dependent vWF binding function and on ristocetin-induced vWF binding is consistent with our previous findings that ristocetin is a better mimic of the physiologic interaction than is botrocetin (41Dong J.F. Berndt M.C. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Andrews R.K. López J. Blood. 2001; 97: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The specific sequence is not as critical for ristocetin-induced binding as for botrocetin-induced binding, which is markedly perturbed by both the Phe and the Glu substitutions. The latter indicates that the anionic sulfated region of GP Ibα may constitute, at least partially, a direct site for botrocetin-induced vWF binding, with the sulfates being absolutely required for the interaction. Third, the results suggest that the three negative charges contributed by the sulfated tyrosines are important in maintaining the affinity of the GP Ibα-vWF interaction. The Phe mutants, lacking these negative charges, interact abnormally with immobilized vWF under conditions of flow, demonstrated by the presence of fewer rolling cells and by the fact that those cells that did adhere to the surface translocated by saltation rather than by continuous rolling (Figs. 5and 6). This defect was partially compensated by increasing the surface levels of the mutant receptor.In summary, we present evidence that sulfation of tyrosine residues within the anionic sulfated region of platelet GP Ibα contributes negative charges that are critical for the interaction of GP Ibα with vWF under flow and in the presence of ristocetin. Although charge rather than a specific sequence is important for these interactions, the same is not true for the interaction induced by botrocetin. Our results strongly support the notion that there is more than one binding site on GP Ibα for vWF and that the choice of that site depends on the means by which the interaction is induced. Tyrosine sulfation is a widespread posttranslational protein modification that occurs in the trans-Golgi compartment where it is catalyzed by the membrane-bound enzyme, aryl sulfotransferase (15Huttner W.B. Nature. 1982; 299: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar,35Huttner W.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 361-363Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 36Hortin G. Folz R.

Biochem. 1992; 24: 1349-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A large number of proteins have been found to contain this modification, but its functional role has only been demonstrated in a few cases (19Leyte A. van Schijndel H.B. Niehrs C. Huttner W.B.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13946-13953Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Marchese P. Murata M. Mazzucato M. Pradella P. De Marco L. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Even with this, the mechanism of how sulfation affects protein function has not been addressed for GP Ibα and has only been addressed in one other case to our knowledge (40Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T. Cell. 2000; 103: 467-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The two most obvious means by which tyrosine sulfation may participate in protein function is by either providing or contributing to a specific structure (e.g.through folding) or by contributing negative charges. An alternative has been suggested by the work of Somers et al. (40Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T. Cell. 2000; 103: 467-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) who recently showed that the sulfated tyrosines of P-selection glycoprotein ligand-1 participate in calcium ion coordination when this protein binds its counter-receptor, P-selectin. In the current study we examined whether sulfate is specifically required for GP Ibα function or whether substituting another acidic residue for the sulfate will maintain vWF binding function. We addressed this issue by constructing cell lines expressing either wild-type GP Ibα or mutant receptors substituting the three tyrosines with either phenylalanine or glutamate residues. The Phe substitutions maintained the phenyl groups of the tyrosines but eliminated the p-hydroxy group, thereby preventing sulfation. The Glu substitutions, on the other hand, changed the side chains radically but preserved their net charge. Both mutants were expressed on the cell surface normally and retained the normal conformation of the GP Ibα N terminus, as determined by the binding of several conformation-sensitive antibodies. The monoclonal antibody SZ2 failed to bind both mutants because the anionic sulfated region constitutes its binding site (13Ward C.M. Andrews R.K. Smith A.I. Berndt M.C.

When vWF binding was induced by botrocetin, a snake venom protein known to bind vWF and alter its conformation, both mutants were found to be markedly defective (Fig. 4 lower). This is consistent with extensive previous work showing that the anionic sulfated site of GP Ibα is important in botrocetin-induced vWF binding and that even minor perturbations of this site can alter binding drastically (7López J.A.

This defect in ristocetin-induced vWF binding was indeed mimicked by a defect in attachment of the cells to immobilized vWF in a flow chamber. At surface densities of the Phe mutant similar to those on wild-type cells that bound and rolled on the surface, cells expressing the mutant failed to attach to the surface. At roughly double those surface densities, the cells attached and a few rolled, but most of them translocated along the surface by saltation (Fig. 6).

https://openalex.org/W2049852201,"Human β1,4-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase I (ST6GalI) recognition of glycoprotein acceptors has been investigated using various soluble forms of the enzyme deleted to a variable extent in the N-terminal half of the polypeptide. Full-length and truncated forms of the enzyme have been investigated with respect to their specificity for a variety of desialylated glycoproteins of known complex glycans as well as related proteins with different carbohydrate chains. Differences in transfer efficiency have been observed between membrane and soluble enzymatic forms, indicating that deletion of the transmembrane fragment induces loss of acceptor preference.

When tested on free oligosaccharides, soluble ST6GalI displayed full ability to sialylate free N-glycans as well as various N-acetyllactosaminyl substrates.

Many of these enzymes are in charge of assembling cell-surface glycoconjugates, for which the extent of sialylation has been increasingly recognized as the molecular determinant of a wide array of biological recognition processes as different as viral and bacterial adhesion, immune response, and neuronal outgrowth (1Varki A. FASEB. J. 1997; 11: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 2Gagneux P. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). These events equally involve all types of glycoconjugates and different glycosidic linkages, but the key specificity of such complex molecular recognition is still unclear to us. It thus appears of primary importance to elucidate how glycan expression at the cell surface is controlled by glycosyltransferases. Especially within a transferase family sharing similar catalytic properties, the determinants governing specificity for their substrates and their underlying respective acceptor(s) need to be identified to understand the structural information that may be encoded by these enzymes through such a remarkable diversity. Sialyltransferases constitute a family of at least 15 distinct glycosyltransferases that catalyze the transfer of sialic acid from CMP-NeuAc to glycoproteins or glycolipids during biosynthesis in animals and man (3Tsuji S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 4Harduin-Lepers A. Recchi M.-A. Delannoy P. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 741-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A number of them have been cloned across the animal kingdom, including bacteria, suggesting a broad function throughout evolution (1Varki A. FASEB. J. 1997; 11: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, they share with the other glycosyltransferases a typical type II architecture with a short cytoplasmic N-terminal tail, a transmembrane fragment followed by a stem of variable length, and a C-terminal catalytic domain facing the lumen of the Golgi apparatus (5Paulson J.C. Colley K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike other glycosyltransferase families, they display significant sequence homology in their catalytic domain, viz. three conserved peptide sequences designated as sialyl motifs L and S (6Datta A. Paulson J.C. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 34: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar) and VS (7Geremia R.A. Harduin-Lepers A. Delannoy P. Glycobiology. 1997; 2: v-viiGoogle Scholar). Mutagenesis of the L motif, consisting of ∼50 amino acids present in the middle of the catalytic domain, showed that it is largely involved in donor recognition (8Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), whereas the S motif, located closer to the C terminus, contributes to the binding of both donor and acceptor substrates (9Datta A.K. Sinha A. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9608-9614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Sialyltransferases are generally named and classified according to the nature of the monosaccharide substrate and the type of linkage formed (10Tsuji S. Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Glycobiology. 1996; 7: v-viGoogle Scholar). Within a subfamily catalyzing the same glycosidic bond, sialyltransferase members may exhibit very low amino acid sequence identity as well as major differences in acceptor substrate recognition, i.e. in their requirement for simple or more complex acceptor structures (11Kurusawa N. Hamamoto T. Lee Y.C. Nakaoka T. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1402-1409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical example demonstrating such keen specificity in substrate recognition resides in the ST6GalNAc1 group. ST6GalNAcI, likely to be involved in the synthesis of the sialosyl-Tn antigen, exhibits the broadest specificity on (NeuAcα2,3)0–1(Galβ1,3)0–1GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr, whereas ST6GalNAcIII was shown to be specific for NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,3GalNAcα/β-R without discriminating between α- and β-linked GalNAc (11Kurusawa N. Hamamoto T. Lee Y.C. Nakaoka T. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1402-1409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sjoberg E.R. Kitagawa H. Glushka J. Van Halbeek H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7450-7459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As a result, this enzyme can synthesize the GD1a antigen (12Sjoberg E.R. Kitagawa H. Glushka J. Van Halbeek H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7450-7459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ST6GalNAcII presents an intermediate specificity and is active on (NeuAcα 2,3)0–1Galβ1,3GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr (13Kurosawa N. Inoue M. Yoshida Y. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15109-15116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and isoforms I and II are considered to be responsible for mucin synthesis. The recently cloned ST6GalNAcIV displays a similar substrate specificity to that of ST6GalNAcIII, but prefers O-glycans to glycolipids (14Lee Y.C. Kaufman M. Kitazume-Kawaguchi S. Kono M. Takashima S. Kurosawa S. Kurosawa N. Liu H.L. Pircher H. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11958-11967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Another candidate for GD1a synthase activity has been identified in mouse and is referred to as ST6GalNAcV (15Ikehara Y. Shimizu N. Kono M. Nishihara S. Nakanishi H. Kitamura T. Narimatsu H. Tsuji S. Tatematsu M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Comparison of peptide sequences reveals interesting features since ST6GalNAcIII appears to be virtually devoid of a stem region, whereas ST6GalNAcI exhibits the longest variable region. It thus appears that in this group, the broader the acceptor specificity, the longer the stem region. Other examples showing distinct acceptor preferences can be found among sialyltransferase families. Among the six enzymatically distinct human α2,3-sialyltransferases cloned to date, galactoside α2,3 sialyltransferase ST3GalI and ST3GalII display similar catalytic activity for Galβ1,3GalNAc substrates common to O-linked glycans and glycolipids. ST3GalI prefers glycoproteins to glycolipids, whereas ST3GalII prefers glycolipids (16Kojima N. Lee Y.C. Hamamoto T. Kurosawa N. Tsuji S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5772-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, ST3GalIII was found to utilize Galβ1,3GlcNAc more efficiently than Galβ1,4GlcNAcin vitro (17Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Other studies also demonstrated that mouse α2,8 sialyltransferase II requires the presence of internal fucose on N-glycans as well as the polypeptide region to sialylate variants of the neural adhesion molecule at special IgG-like domains (18Kojima N. Tachida Y. Yoshida Y. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19457-19463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is thus believed that these enzymes should display specific structural features to transfer sugars to appropriate acceptors and to exhibit such exquisite specificity. Very recently, three x-ray crystallographic structures of eukaryotic glycosyltransferases have been reported (19Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 20Ünligil U.M. Zhou S. Yuwaraj S. Schachter H. Rini J.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34580-34585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) showing common structural features, which are as follows: (i) the occurrence of a structurally very similar catalytic domain consisting of a three-layer α/β/α-fold and (ii) the presence of a large pocket on one face capable of accommodating both the donor and acceptor substrates, surrounded by conserved motifs identified for a given glycosyltransferase family (22Breton C. Imberty A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It appears that the recognition of donor substrate is mediated by residues that are found in the most conserved regions, but very little experimental background has so far delineated those residues that specify acceptor recognition. For several α2,3-fucosyltransferases, a region located in a hypervariable segment at the N-terminal end of the catalytic domain was shown to account for differences in acceptor recognition (23Legault D.J. Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20987-20996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12257-12262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that soluble forms of some transferases are less efficient in vivo than their membrane-bound counterparts in glycosylating endogenous acceptors (26Zhu G. Allende M.L. Jaskiewicz E. Qian R. Darling D.S. Worth A. Colley K.J. Young W.W Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas no difference was observed for other classes of enzyme (27Cho S.K. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13622-13628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that acceptor recognition may reside in variable regions, and as a result, we investigated whether or not it could be located within the stem region. We therefore compared the activity of membrane and soluble forms of human ST6GalI (EC 2.4.99.1) for glycoprotein acceptors of known glycan structure and show here that deleting the stem region of this transferase results in loss of acceptor preference together with increased transfer efficiency. We thus tentatively conclude that,in vivo, the juxtamembrane region of ST6GalI restricts enzyme specificity and activity. Asialofetuin and human protein acceptors, neuraminidase, CMP-NeuAc, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and cacodylic acid were purchased from Sigma. Synthetic acceptor substrate (LacNAc-O-spacer-biotin) was purchased from Syntesome. Biotinylated Sambucus nigra lectin was from EY Laboratories. Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugates were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Restriction enzymes, purified rat liver α2,6-sialyltransferase, andTaq polymerase (high fidelity) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. FLAG-cytomegalovirus plasmid was from Eastman Kodak Co. pcDNA3 was from Invitrogen. fluorescent-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis gels were from Bio-Rad. All culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Oligonucleotide primers were from and plasmid sequencing was carried out by Eurogentec. The cDNA encoding ST6GalI was isolated from an HL-60 cDNA library and further cloned in the FLAG-cytomegalovirus expression vector containing the preprotrypsinogen signal peptide upstream from the FLAG sequence. Sequencing of the insert showed the same sequence as the one published earlier (28Grundman U. Nerlich C. Rein T. Zettlmeissl G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 667-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The full-length sequence was also deleted of the same N-terminal portion for the soluble form to be constructed in stably transfected CHO-K1 cells. Various truncated forms of human ST6GalI lacking the transmembrane fragment were cloned into the pFLAG expression vector. The Δ1–28 form of ST6GalI was stably transfected in CHO-K1 cells for comparison with the membrane ST6GalI form, and a chimeric form was constructed with the N-terminal (amino acids 1–52) membrane portion of the rat core 2 β1,6-GlcNAc-transferase and Δ1–70 of human ST6GalI and also tagged at the N terminus. The six soluble forms of ST6GalI deleted to a variable extent (Δ1–28, Δ1–35, Δ1–48, Δ1–60, Δ1–80, and Δ1–100) were transiently expressed in COS cells as summarized in Scheme FS1. The cell culture media were collected over a 48–72-h period and further concentrated >10-fold by Centriprep centrifugation. Each batch was assayed for activity on asialofetuin to calibrate enzyme production and stored in small aliquots of similar activity at −20 °C. When necessary, the amount of the tagged protein was further estimated by competitive immunoassays using anti-FLAG antibodies. The stable cell line was found to secrete ∼10 ng of FLAG-ST6GalI/106 cells/h. The specific activity of this enzymatic form was estimated to be 7.5 units/mg of protein. Human soluble ST6GalI was produced in Pichia pastoris after truncation of the N terminus and the transmembrane fragment as described (29Malissard M. Zeng S. Berger E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This deletion was therefore very similar to the FLAG-ST6GalI construct. The activity present in the supernatant was 0.8 milliunits/mg of yeast protein. Transfection of cells was carried out using FLAG-cytomegalovirus plasmids containing the different ST6GalI constructs and the LipofectAMINE (Life Sciences) procedure as recommended by the manufacturer. Semiconfluent cells were routinely transfected with ∼5 μg of plasmid DNA. Stably transfected CHO-K1 cells were selected using Geneticin at a concentration of 500 μg/ml over a time period of at least 4 weeks. Transient expression was routinely performed in COS cells using a lower selection pressure of the antibiotics. The preference of ST6GalI for glycoprotein acceptors was assayed according to a solid-phase procedure described earlier by us (30Fenouillet E. Fayet G. Hovsepian S. Bahraoui M. Ronin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15153-15158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the sialic acid-specific lectin S. nigra (SNA) as reported by Mattox et al. (31Mattox S. Walrath K. Ceiler D. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, coating of microtiter plates was carried out using increasing amounts of protein acceptors in 100 μl of 50 mm PBS (pH 7.5) overnight at 4 °C. After saturating wells with 2% bovine serum albumin and washings, coated glycoproteins were treated with neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens overnight at room temperature (30Fenouillet E. Fayet G. Hovsepian S. Bahraoui M. Ronin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15153-15158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of sialic acid removal was assessed on each plate using fetuin (1 μg) for comparison with a standard preparation of asialofetuin taken as a reference. Washings were performed with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20. Incubation with the various forms of ST6GalI was carried out in 50 mm cacodylate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 32 μm CMP-NeuAc and 2 mmMnCl2 in a final volume of 100 μl for 1–2 h at 35 °C. Cell supernatants containing soluble forms of ST6GalI were concentrated >10-fold using Centriprep columns. Immunopurification of sialyltransferase variants was performed by incubating the concentrated supernatant overnight with anti-FLAG antibodies coupled to agarose beads and further released by 25 μg of FLAG peptide at 4 °C prior to use. Intracellular full-length membrane ST6GalI forms were extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 50 mm PBS for 45 min at 0 °C, and a 10,000 × g supernatant was immediately tested for activity. Sialic acid linked in the α2,6-position was measured by amplifying SNA binding to the reaction product using a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate as previously described (31Mattox S. Walrath K. Ceiler D. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All assays were performed in quadruplicates, and the data are expressed as the means of these values. Nonspecific binding was assessed using non-transfected cell media or extracts and was generally found to give an absorbance of 0.2–0.3. This value was deduced from the assays in all graphs. Since different forms of the ST6GalI enzyme were assayed on several acceptors containing glycans exhibiting variable content of available galactose residues, the activity of each transferase form had to be calibrated. For the commercial enzyme, 1 unit of activity is the amount of enzyme catalyzing the transfer of 1 μmol of NeuAc to asialofetuin/min at 37 °C. In the first step, we standardized this activity to a standard calibrator preparation of this protein under the above conditions to determine the comparative activity of soluble forms of the rat liver enzyme. Under these conditions, solid-phase assays were designed to contain at least 0.7 milliunits of recombinant soluble forms when tested on asialofetuin, reaching an absorbance of 0.8 ± S.D. When various deletion variants were compared, the activity of each enzyme was adapted to this absorbance per 1 μg of acceptor/60 min, a period of time of linear velocity over which sialic acid is transferred as a function of time. Standard reactions were conducted at 37 °C for 15–60 min in a final volume of 50 μl in the presence of 50 μmCMP-NeuAc, 3.5 μm CMP-[14C]NeuAc (110,000 cpm), 1 mm LacNAc-O-spacer-biotin or asialofetuin (2 mg/ml) as acceptor, and 2 mmMnCl2 in 50 mm cacodylate buffer (pH 6.5). The reaction was initiated by addition of the cell supernatant. In assays with the LacNAc derivative, the reaction was stopped by addition of 3 ml of cold water, and the mixture was applied to a Waters Sep-Pak C18 reverse-phase chromatography cartridge. After washing with 15 ml of water, the radiolabeled product was eluted with 3 ml of methanol and counted with 3 volumes of liquid counting scintillant (Ultima-FloM, Packard Instrument Co.). In assays with asialofetuin, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.5 ml of cold water and applied to NanosepTM 10 kDa centrifugal cartridges (Pall Filtron Corp.) to remove unreacted CMP-[14C]NeuAc by diafiltration. Radioactivity associated with the protein acceptor was assessed by adding 3 volumes of aqueous counting scintillant (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The apparentK m value for CMP-NeuAc was obtained using 8–250 μm CMP-NeuAc with 8 μmCMP-[14C]NeuAc and 1 mm LacNAc acceptor. TheK m value for the LacNAc acceptor was determined using 0.1–4 mm LacNAc-O-spacer-biotin with 100 μm CMP-NeuAc and 5.25 μmCMP-[14C]NeuAc. The K m value for the glycoprotein acceptor was determined using 0.025–0.25 mmasialofetuin in the presence of 100 μm CMP-NeuAc and 5.25 μm CMP-[14C]NeuAc. In all assays, consumption of substrates was kept below 15–20% to ensure accurate initial rate measurements, and each test was done in duplicate. To analyze sialic acid transfer to N-glycans of different structure, carbohydrate chains from asialofetuin and native or recombinant glycoprotein hormones were released byN-glycanase and further labeled with a 2-aminobenzoic acid chromophore as recommended by Bio-Rad. Labeled glycans were incubated with or without soluble ST6 forms from CHO cells or yeast. The reaction mixture was then precipitated with ethanol overnight at −20 °C. The 15,000 × g supernatants were evaporated and further dissolved in water. The labeled glycans were then separated by gel electrophoresis and detected at 540 nm using a Bio-Rad GlycoImager. Size calibration was carried out using a glucose ladder and an N-glycan library provided by the manufacturer. Double labeling with FITC-SNA and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 was performed as follows. FITC-SNA labeling was assayed essentially as reported (32Zerfaoui M. Fukuda M. Sbarra V. Lombardo D. El Battari A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed for 5 min with 0.5% paraformaldehyde in calcium- and magnesium-containing PBS and incubated with 50 μg/ml lectin for 60 min on ice. For intracellular distribution of FLAG-tagged enzymes, FITC-SNA-stained cells were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum, and incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 for 1 h. They were then rinsed three times and incubated with rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody for 1 additional h, and staining was visualized by confocal microscopy on a Leica instrument (Uniblitz Sutter Instrument Co.). Confocal images were processed with Metamorph Imaging System Version 3.5. Volumes were originally raytraced as 24-bit TrueColor images and transferred to Adobe Photoshop as 24-bit RGB TIFF files. Protein sequences were retrieved from the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank and analyzed using BLAST programs (33Altschul S.F. Madden T.L.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) and ClustalW (34Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions were performed using programs available on the NPS and JPred servers. The specificity of the rat enzyme has been extensively characterized (5Paulson J.C. Colley K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Datta A. Paulson J.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9608-9614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); and since sequence analysis of rat liver and human ST6GalI showed 88% identity, it is assumed that the specificity of both enzymes is very similar. Of particular interest is the earlier observation by us that recognition of the human enzyme for LacNAc residues includes the branch downstream of the α-linked mannose (35Van Dorst J.A.L.M. Tikkanen J. Krezdorn C.H. Streiff M.B. Berger E.G. Van Kuik J.A. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), confirming the earlier observation that, like the rat enzyme, ST6GalI can discriminate glycan acceptors on the basis of their branching pattern (36Paulson J.C. Rearick J.I. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2363-2371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary testing showed that the purified liver preparation was more stable than the native form of the human enzyme extracted from transfected cells using a detergent. We therefore used the rat liver transferase to compare the acceptor preference of the same soluble forms of human ST6GalI expressed in two different systems for various glycoproteins of known glycan structure. First, we investigated the influence of the branching pattern on enzyme specificity based on the earlier results that fetuin, human transferrin, and human α1-acid glycoprotein are efficient acceptors for the native enzyme (37Yeh J.C. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These glycoprotein acceptors all contain complex-type N-glycans with terminal LacNAc groups, but differ in branching pattern and sialylated bonds. Human transferrin contains biantennary glycans sialylated in the α2,6-position; fetuin contains 2,2,4-triantennary glycans with both α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic acids; and α1-acid glycoprotein contains 2,2,4,6-tetraantennary N-glycans with both α2,3- and α2,6-sialic acid. The presence of α2,6-linkages was confirmed by SNA binding to native preparations, and loss of lectin binding confirmed the removal of sialic acid by the neuraminidase treatment (data not shown). We thus first compared the specificity for these acceptors of native and soluble forms of ST6GalI produced in mammalian cells or yeast. When the desialylated glycoproteins were incubated with membrane ST6GalI in the presence of CMP-NeuAc and the reaction products were probed by lectin binding (Fig. 1), efficient transfer was recorded in all cases, with affinity values similar to those reported previously, with the membrane enzyme having a slightly better recognition of asialofetuin compared with other desialylated glycoproteins (Fig. 1 A). These results with the rat transferase are similar to those previously reported (37Yeh J.C. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and this assay has been repeated here for comparative purposes. Interestingly, the soluble forms of similar length produced in CHO cells (Fig.1 B) or yeast (Fig. 1 C) equally recognized these acceptors, independently of the expression system. These findings show that the soluble enzymes did not differ in binding asialoglycoprotein acceptors and therefore suggest that differential acceptor recognition by the full-length transferase has been altered by truncation of the membrane anchor. To understand whether or not the enzyme may recognize a determinant present in the polypeptide backbone that could influence branch specificity, we investigated a family of structurally related proteins sharing bi- or triantennary glycans differing in terminal glycosylation. Glycoprotein hormones are heterodimers sharing a common α-subunit and differing in their β-subunit (38Grossman M. Weintraub B.D. Szkudlinski M.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 476-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 39Ronin C. J. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 1998; 36: 373-378PubMed Google Scholar). Placental hCG contains biantennary g"

It mediates activator-dependent transcription by RNA polymerase II, apparently through interactions with the transcriptional activator and basal transcription machinery (1Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 2Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). PC4 binds double-stranded DNA in a sequence-independent manner. The regions required for the binding and for coactivation overlap in PC4. However, the coactivator function also depends on its ability to interact with the preinitiation complex (1Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar,3Kaiser K. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3520-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Presumably both DNA binding and interaction with general transcription factors (predominantly TATA box-binding protein and TFIIA) are involved in coactivation by PC4. Recently, it was reported that PC4 binds tightly to melted double-stranded and single-stranded DNA through its novel C-terminal fold. It has been demonstrated that interactions of this unique C-terminal domain with the melted DNA repress transcription that can be attenuated by TFIIH and phosphorylation of PC4 (4Brandsen J. Werten S. Van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. Kroon J. Gros P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 5Werten S. Langen F.W.M. Shaik R.V. Timmers H.T.M.

PC4 is subjected to in vivo phosphorylation events that negatively regulate its coactivator function and its interactions with the activator and TATA box-binding protein/TFIIA (2Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 7Ge H. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12691-12695Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation also inhibits double-stranded DNA binding but not the single-stranded DNA binding (3Kaiser K. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3520-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mutation and mass spectrometric analyses suggest that phosphorylation of PC4 in vivo is mediated by casein kinase II (CKII), and it is restricted to seven serine residues between 2 and 28 at the N terminus (7Ge H. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12691-12695Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly 95% of the total cellular PC4 is phosphorylated and thus inactivein vivo, whereas only 5% is in the nonphosphorylated active form. Among the different human PCs, PC1/Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, PC3/topoisomerase I, PC4, PC52, high mobility group protein 1 (HMG-1), and HMG-2 are relatively abundant nuclear proteins that display somewhat generalized, sequence-independent DNA binding properties and are involved in diverse nuclear processes besides RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription (reviewed in Refs. 8Malik S. Gu W. Wu W. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and 9Guermah M. Malik S. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3234-3244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it raises the possibility that PC4 may be a chromatin protein having transcriptional coactivator function. The reversible acetylation of nucleosomal histones and presumably non-histone chromatin proteins plays a significant role in chromatin-mediated transcription regulation. The idea that histone acetylation is related causally to transcriptional activation has received solid support from the discovery that a number of transcriptional coactivators have histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. These include GCN5 and PCAF, p300 and CBP, nuclear receptor coactivators SRC1 and ACTR, and TATA box-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250 and HIV-1-tat interactive protein, TIP60 (10Brown C.E. Lechner T. Howe L. Workman J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 11Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30595-30598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Among these HATs, the HAT activity of yeast GCN5 and human p300 has been shown to be involved directly in chromatin-mediated transcriptional activation (12Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar, 13Kundu T.K. Palhan V. Wang Z. An W. Cole P.A. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, histones are not the only substrates of HAT proteins. For example, CBP/p300 can acetylate p53, resulting in an enhancement of its DNA binding activity. CBP/p300 also can acetylate basal transcription factors such as TFIIEβ and TFIIF, the roles of which are not known (14Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar, 15Imof A. Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). It is known that HMG proteins also are reversibly acetylatedin vivo. In duck erythrocytes, two acetylation sites in HMG-1 and HMG-14 and three sites in HMG-17 were identified (16Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it has been reported that PCAF is the enzyme responsible for the acetylation of HMG-17 at position 2. Apparently binding of HMG-14 and HMG-17 to nucleosome cores inhibits the PCAF-mediated acetylation of histone H3. Thus the presence of HMG-17 affects the ability of PCAF to acetylate chromatin, whereas the acetylation of HMG-17 reduces its binding affinity to chromatin (17Herrera J.E. Sakaguchi K. Bergel M. Trieschmann L. Nakatani Y. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3466-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PCAF and CBP can also acetylate HMG-I(Y) either in solution or in the context of the enhanceosome (18Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Acetylation of HMG-I(Y) by CBP but not by PCAF decreases its DNA binding activity and results in enhanceosome destabilization and disassembly. However, both CBP and PCAF HAT activities are required for activation, whereas only CBP HAT activity is required for postinduction turnoff of interferon-β expression. Thus it seems acetylation of HMG protein is an important means of regulating transcription or biological function of them. Because PC4 very closely resembles HMG proteins, it was not too hard to imagine that PC4 also would be substrate for at least one of the several histone acetyltransferases. In support of this possibility we demonstrate that PC4 can be acetylated specifically by p300 among the different HATs tested. Mass spectral analysis and acetylation of recombinant PC4 revealed that there are two lysine residues that are acetylated by p300. Most interestingly, we found that phosphorylation of PC4 by CKII inhibits the p300-mediated acetylation of PC4. However, acetylation does not influence phosphorylation of PC4. Furthermore, acetylation of PC4 stimulates its double-stranded DNA binding activity. These findings may open a new chapter in the understanding of PC4 function in vivo. Recombinant PC4 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described elsewhere (19Ge H. Martinez E. Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, the clear bacterial lysate was passed through a heparin-Sepharose column, and the bound protein was eluted with BC buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 500 mm KCl. The peak protein fractions containing PC4 were pooled and chromatographed onto a 1-ml phosphocellulose P11 column. FLAG epitope-tagged Gal4 and p300 HAT domain (amino acids 1195–1810) also were expressed in E. coli and immunopurified on M2-agarose as described previously (20Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). His6-tagged nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP1) was purified with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen). FLAG epitope-tagged full-length PCAF and His6-tagged full-length p300 were expressed and purified by infection of Sf21 cells with recombinant baculoviruses followed by affinity chromatography of whole-cell extracts on M2-agarose and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column as described elsewhere (21Yang X. Ogryzko V. Nishikawa J. Howard B. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 331-342Crossref Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 22Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Human core histones were purified from HeLa nuclear pellet as described previously (23Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). HAT assays were performed as described elsewhere (23Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Indicated amounts of proteins (see figure legends) were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in a 30-μl final reaction volume consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mm sodium butyrate, and 0.5 μl of 3.3 Ci/mmol [3H]acetyl Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). The reaction mixture then was blotted onto P-81 filter paper. Radioactive counts were recorded on a Wallac 1409 liquid scintillation counter. To visualize the radiolabeled acetylated protein, the reaction products were precipitated with 25% trichloroacetic acid, washed with ice-cold acetone, and resolved electrophoretically on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to fluorography using a solution containing 22.5% 2,5-diphenyloxazole in Me2SO (24Bonnen W. Laskey R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5613) Google Scholar). Gels were dried, and autoradiography was performed at −70 °C for 1–2 days. For the mass spectral analysis of PC4, the protein was acetylated by FLAG epitope-tagged recombinant p300 HAT domain (amino acids 1195–1810). In a typical reaction mixture, 30 μg of PC4 and p300 HAT domain was incubated in the presence of 50 μm acetyl-CoA at 37 °C for 1.5 h. To have the efficient acetylation, p300 and acetyl-CoA were added at every 30-min interval. The reaction volume was scaled up to 1000 μl and then concentrated to 100 μl using a 10K cutoff Centricon concentrator (Amicon). Acetylation of protein was confirmed by analyzing the protein on 15% acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel. The acetylated protein was dialyzed against water before being subjected to mass spectral analysis. Electrospray ionization mass spectral analysis was done in an HP:1100 machine using acidified water (pH 3.0). The solvent flow rate used was 0.03 ml/min. Nitrogen gas was used for drying and nebulization. In the phosphorylation reaction, 0.25 μg of the recombinant PC4 was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the phosphorylation buffer (50 mmHEPES-K+, pH 7.6, 125 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 6% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 5 mm ATP with 10 milliunits of rat liver CKII in a total volume of 20 μl. For large scale purification of phosphorylated PC4, the reaction volume was scaled up to 1000 μl and concentrated to a final volume of 100 μl using a 10K cutoff Centricon concentrator (Amicon). To determine the effect of acetylation on phosphorylation, the acetylated PC4 (0.25 μg) was subjected toin vitro phosphorylation using 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 mm cold ATP. To visualize the phosphorylated proteins, the reaction products were precipitated with 25% trichloroacetic acid, washed with ice-cold acetone, and resolved electrophoretically on 15% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were stained and/or autoradiographed. The extent of phosphorylation was quantitated using a Fuji phosphorimaging analyzer. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was carried out essentially as described previously (3Kaiser K. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3520-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The sequence of the oligonucleotide comprising of HIV-1 core promoter sequences upstream of the initiator region of the adenovirus major late promoter (5′-CCCTCAGATGCTGCATATAAGCAGCTGCTTTTTGCCCGTCCTCACTCTCTTCCGCATCGC-3′) was used for the assays. The indicated amounts of different proteins were incubated with 40 fmol of either double-stranded labeled oligonucleotide for 30 min at 30 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.4 m KCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The reaction mixtures then were resolved on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel at 130 V in TGE buffer (25 mmTris, 100 mm glycine, and 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for 3 h. The gels were dried and autoradiogrammed. Quantitation of the DNA-protein complex was carried out using a Fuji phosphorimaging analyzer. To test whether PC4 could be acetylated by known HATs, full-length His6-tagged p300 (21Yang X. Ogryzko V. Nishikawa J. Howard B. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 331-342Crossref Scopus (1306) Google Scholar) and FLAG epitope-tagged PCAF (22Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) from respective baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells (Fig.1 B) were purified. The native recombinant human PC4 (19Ge H. Martinez E. Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), Gal4 DNA-binding domain, and the nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP1) (23Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) also were purified from E. coli for this purpose. The highly purified human core histones were isolated from HeLa nuclear pellet (Fig. 1 A) (23Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The Gal4 DNA-binding domain and NAP1 were used in the protein acetyltransferase assay as negative controls. The human core histones were included as positive controls in all the assays. The authenticity of the purified human PC4 was checked by Western blotting using polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 1 C). The reaction mixtures containing equivalent amounts of either p300 or PCAF as normalized by filter binding assay using highly purified human core histones (Fig.2 A) and the indicated amount of proteins (see figure legends) were incubated with [3H]acetyl-CoA for 30 min at 30 °C. The products were analyzed by autoradiography of acetylated reaction products resolved on SDS-PAGE gels. As shown in Fig. 2 B it was observed that PC4 can only be acetylated by p300 but not with equivalent activity of PCAF (compare lanes 5 and 6). As expected, p300 could not acetylate NAP1 and Gal4 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7 and8), showing the specificity of p300-mediated acetylation. The acetylation of PC4 was completely dependent on the presence of both [3H]acetyl-CoA and p300, confirming the p300-mediated acetylation of PC4 (Fig. 2 C).Figure 2In vitro acetylation of PC4.

In addition to PCAF, the equivalent HAT activity of GCN5 (short form) (25Alexander C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1430-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and TIP60 (11Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30595-30598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) also could not acetylate PC4 under the identical conditions (data not shown). There are several non-histone proteins that are substrates of p300 and can be acetylated also by PCAF. These include p53, TFIIBβ, TFIIF, and HMG-17 (15Imof A. Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 17Herrera J.E. Sakaguchi K. Bergel M. Trieschmann L. Nakatani Y. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3466-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, HMG-14, which is related closely to HMG-17, can be acetylated only by p300 but not PCAF at the nucleosomal binding domain similar to what we report for PC4. It would be interesting to find out the mechanisms behind this p300 specificity of PC4 acetylation. To find out the number of lysine residues that are getting acetylated in PC4, an acetylation reaction was carried out using purified FLAG epitope-tagged, recombinant p300 HAT domain (20Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). To obtain the complete acetylation of PC4, the reaction was performed at 37 °C for a longer time, and the HAT domain and acetyl-CoA were added every 30 min (see “Experimental Procedures”). The complete acetylation was confirmed by analyzing the acetylated protein on 15% acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel (data not shown). The acetylated protein then was dialyzed thoroughly against water and subjected to electrospray ionization mass spectral analysis. As shown in Fig.3 A, unmodified mock control protein (treated with p300 HAT domain without acetyl-CoA) gave a major peak with a molecular weight of 14,265, confirming the identity of native PC4 as described previously (7Ge H. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12691-12695Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The acetylated protein showed a peak of 14,346 (Fig. 3 B). The mass difference between the acetylated and the unmodified proteins suggests that there are at least two lysine residues getting acetylated by p300. Isolation of native PC4 from HeLa nuclear extract showed 95% of the protein present as the heavily phosphorylated form in vivo(7Ge H. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12691-12695Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation negatively regulates PC4-mediated transcriptional coactivator activity. Presumably, phosphorylation imposes a structural change in PC4 which in turn may effect p300-mediated acetylation of PC4. To investigate this possibility, PC4 was phosphorylated to saturation levels in vitro by casein kinase II as depicted in Fig.4 A. The optimum conditions for this complete phosphorylation was standardized for 0.25 μg of PC4, 10 milliunits of casein kinase II, and 5 mm ATP (Fig.4 A, compare lanes 1 and 4). Consistent with our prediction, we found that indeed phosphorylation of PC4 modulates the acetylation negatively as of any other functional consequence of the phosphorylation. In an in vitroacetylation reaction, an equivalent amount of unmodified PC4 subjected to a mock-phosphorylation reaction (without ATP) was acetylated efficiently in a p300- and [3H]acetyl-CoA-dependent manner, whereas phosphorylated PC4 was not acetylated at all (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 2 and 4). This interesting result tempted us to find out what happens in the reverse consequences,i.e. how acetylation of PC4 influences its phosphorylation. To address this question, PC4 was acetylated in vitro with p300 and cold acetyl-CoA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The acetylation of PC4 was confirmed by mass spectral analysis of the acetylated protein as described in Fig. 3. The acetylated protein then was subjected to an in vitrophosphorylation reaction by casein kinase II (Fig. 4 C) and [γ-32P]ATP. We found that both acetylated and unacetylated PC4 was phosphorylated efficiently by CKII (Fig.4 C, lanes 1 and 5 versus lane 6). The quantitation of phosphorylation by phosphorimaging analysis showed that acetylation of PC4 has no effect on phosphorylation under the present reaction condition. Phosphorylation of substrates or the enzyme (HAT) itself may be one of the key regulators of acetylation of histones and non-histone proteins. Phosphorylation of CBP by cyclin E-Cdk2 in the C-terminal region enhances its activity almost 5-fold (26Ait-Si-Ali S. Ramirez S. Barre F.-X. Dkhissi F. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Girault J.A. Robin P. Knibiehler M. Pritchard L.L. Ducommun B. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 396: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Probably phosphorylation induces a structural change in CBP that leads to the activation of acetylation function. Similarly phosphorylation of ATF-2 (27Kawasaki H. Schiltz L. Chiu R. Itakura K. Taira K. Nakatani Y. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 2000; 405: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), a transcription factor that stimulates CRE-dependent transcription, enhances its intrinsic HAT activity, whereas GCN5-HAT activity is inhibited by Ku-DNA-dependent protein kinase complex-mediated phosphorylation (28Barlev N.A. Poltoratsky V. Owen-Hughes T. Ying C. Liu L. Workman J.L. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). On the other hand phosphorylation of histone H3 stimulates acetylation (10-fold) by GCN5 (29Cheung P. Tanner K.G. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Recently it was reported that phosphorylation of p53 enhances its acetylation, which consequently enhances its DNA binding ability as well as the repair activity (14Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar, 30Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). The negative regulation of acetylation upon the phosphorylation of the substrate is somewhat unique for PC4. As per our knowledge there is no report yet in which phosphorylation of a substrate inhibits acetylation. PC4 has a serine-rich acidic domain at the N terminus followed by a lysine-rich domain that is linked to a unique single-stranded DNA-binding domain (4Brandsen J. Werten S. Van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. Kroon J. Gros P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 5Werten S. Langen F.W.M. Shaik R.V. Timmers H.T.M. Meisterernst M. Van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Werten S. Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Langen F.M. Gros P. Timmers H.T.M. Van der Vliet P.C. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5103-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It may be possible that the phosphorylation of serine residues in the serine-rich acidic domain may induce a conformational change in PC4 that masks the acetylation sites in or around the lysine-rich domain, resulting in a complete abolition of acetylation. This possibility needs to be addressed further by detailed structural studies using site-directed mutagenesis followed by NMR spectroscopy or x-ray crystallography. However, because acetylation does not affect the phosphorylation of PC4, it may be assumed that acetylation of PC4 does not lock it in an active form. At this juncture it is difficult to predict how these two posttranslational modifications (acetylation and phosphorylation) are regulated in vivo to manifest PC4 function. Most likely there are few other proteins having phosphatase as well as deacetylase activity that also are involved in the regulation of PC4 function in the cell. The negative effect of PC4 phosphorylation on acetylation suggests its functional consequence for acetylation. Because phosphorylation also prevents double-stranded DNA binding, which is correlated directly to its positive coactivator function, it is important to examine how acetylation affects the DNA binding ability of PC4. To address this possibility gel-mobility shift assays were done using a 60-base pair-long oligonucleotide comprising the HIV-1 core promoter sequences upstream of the initiator region of the adenovirus major late promoter with phosphorylated PC4 and acetylated PC4. The DNA binding of unmodified PC4 showed cooperativity with increasing concentration of PC4, yielding an uncompact complex (Fig.5, lanes 2-6). Although 0.25 μg of unmodified PC4 produce a fairly good amount of complex, the equivalent amount of phosphorylated PC4 could not bind to the DNA (compare lanes 3 and 9). Interestingly, the similar amount of acetylated PC4 (by p300) enhances the double-stranded DNA binding significantly as compared with the equivalent amount (0.25 μg) of unmodified protein (comparelanes 3 and 7), whereas the addition of p300 only did not stimulate the DNA binding (compare lanes 3 and8 ). It is to be noted that to achieve a similar amount of complex, nearly 3-fold more unmodified protein was needed as compared with the acetylated proteins (compare lanes 6 and7). This experiment was repeated independently five times, and the average enhancement of DNA binding upon acetylation was found to be 40% (±5%) based on the phosphorimaging analysis quantitation. In the present study we observe that a relatively very high amount of PC4 (0.3 μg) is required to get the proper PC4-DNA complex, which is consistent with the previous reports. The uncompact nature of the complex indicates the nonspecific binding of PC4. Although the stimulation of DNA binding by PC4 upon acetylation is not dramatic, it was consistent and very significant for the positive cofactor activity of PC4. Because the double-stranded DNA binding activity was shown to be correlated directly to the coactivation, presumably acetylation also will enhance the transcription. Our results show that phosphorylation that prevents the double-stranded DNA binding also inhibits the acetylation. Thus it is quite possible that phosphorylation-mediated negative regulation of PC4 function operates through two different pathways: first, it prevents the double-stranded DNA binding, direct interaction with TFIIA and TATA box-binding protein complex, and interaction with activators, and second, it inhibits the acetylation. It is tempting to speculate that this phosphorylation and acetylation balance ultimately regulates the PC4 function in vivo, where acetylation would be more relevant under the nucleosomal context.

Crystallization of a ternary complex containing the PPARγ ligand-binding domain, the PPARγ agonist BRL49653, and the nuclear receptor-binding domain of the steroid receptor co-activator-1 (SRC-1) has revealed that association between liganded nuclear receptors and co-activators depends on conserved residues in helix 3 and the AF-2 helix forming a charge clamp and hydrophobic interactions involving helices 3, 4, and 5 and the AF-2 helix (16Nolte R.T.

Although the three-dimensional structure of PPARα has yet to be reported, it has been shown that the C terminus of the ligand-binding domain is essential for the ligand-induced co-activator interaction (19Leers J.

Generally, the formation of CoA esters has been considered a process that merely reduces the availability of the activating PPARα ligands (31Hertz R. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the present study, we present evidence that acyl-CoA esters directly affect PPARα conformation and function in a manner indicating that acyl-CoA esters may act as PPARα antagonists.DISCUSSIONIn the present work, we present evidence suggesting that acyl-CoA esters directly affect the conformation and function of PPARα. Using a variety of in vitro approaches, we show that the nonhydrolyzable acyl-CoA analogue, S-hexadecyl-CoA, antagonizes ligand-induced formation of a PPARα·RXRα·ACO PPRE complex. We were able to demonstrate specific binding of PPARα to immobilized palmitoyl-CoA, and furthermore, we show thatS-hexadecyl-CoA increases the sensitivity of PPARα to chymotrypsin digestion in a manner that depended on the integrity of the ligand-binding pocket. We show that S-hexadecyl-CoA, like well established antagonists for other receptors, abolishes ligand-induced interaction with a co-activator, SRC-1, and conversely increases recruitment of a co-repressor, NCoR. Importantly, we show that S-hexadecyl-CoA is able to affect a PPARα-containing complex in the presence of a molar excess of the natural cellular acyl-CoA carrier, ACBP. These observations, taken together with our recent finding that ACBP and acyl-CoA esters are present in the nuclei of rat hepatocytes (56Elholm M. Garras A. Neve S. Tornehave D. Lund T.B. Skorve J. Flatmark T. Kristiansen K. Berge R. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 538-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are compatible with the notion that acyl-CoA esters also in vivo might be involved in the regulation of PPARα activity. Our results are furthermore supported by recent data showing interaction between acyl-CoA esters and PPARα and PPARγ in competition binding experiments with the labeled synthetic dual agonist, KRP-297 (57Murakami K. Ide T Nakazawa T. Okazaki T. Mochizuki T. Kadowaki T. Biochem.

This size would exclude acyl-CoA esters from the ligand-binding pocket of most nuclear receptors except for the PPARs with ligand-binding pockets of ∼1300 Å3 (16Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S.

It was recently reported that docosahexaenoic acid is a ligand for RXRα, raising the question of whether acyl-CoA esters might also influence the PPARα·RXRα heterodimer via RXRα. However, as mentioned above, the size of the ligand-binding pocket of RXRα is not compatible with specific binding of acyl-CoA esters, and accordingly, we detected no alteration in the sensitivity to chymotrypsin digestion when RXRα was incubated withS-hexadecyl-CoA, and similarly, we observed no binding of RXRα to palmitoyl-CoA.Biochemical and structural studies have revealed a unifying principle determining the interaction of nuclear receptors with co-activators and co-repressors involving an at least partially overlapping binding site (13Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. McInerney E.M. Kurokawa R. Krones A. Rose D.W. Lambert M.H. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 14Nagy L.

The hydrophobic face of helical regions in the receptor interacting domains of co-activators or co-repressors harboring an LXXLL core motif or a related CoRNR motif, respectively, interacts with a hydrophobic pocket formed by helices 3–5 and the AF-2 helix in PPARγ (13Perissi V.

Ligand-dependent positioning of the AF-2 helix and differences in the regions flanking the LXXLL and CoRNR motifs are critically involved in the differential interaction of co-activators and co-repressors with liganded and unliganded nuclear receptors, respectively (13Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. McInerney E.M. Kurokawa R. Krones A. Rose D.W. Lambert M.H. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the crystal structure of PPARγ shows that the AF-2 helix even in the unliganded receptor may fold back against the body of the receptor, assuming a conformation similar to the conformation stabilized by interactions between the polar head group of ligands and the AF-2 helix (16Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar, 18Gampe Jr., R.T.

Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). Our finding thatS-hexadecyl-CoA decreases interaction with SRC-1 and increases recruitment of NCoR indicates that the bulky CoA head influences directly or indirectly the positioning of the AF-2 helix. Thus, the bulky CoA head group of S-hexadecyl-CoA may prevent the AF-2 helix from folding back, forcing the AF-2 helix to adopt an extended conformation contrasting with the unliganded conformation that allows the AF-2 helix to fold back. The increased sensitivity of PPARα to chymotrypsin digestion upon binding of S-hexadecyl-CoA is also indicative of a less compact conformation.Examination of the crystal structure of PPARγ and PPARδ (16Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar, 17Xu H.E.

In addition, the crystal structure of liganded PPARγ and PPARδ revealed prominent interactions between the polar head group of the different agonists and the AF-2 helix (16Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B.

In contrast, co-crystallization of the partial agonist GW0072 with the ligand-binding domain of PPARγ revealed a mode of binding in which the carboxylic group of GW0072 was oriented toward the loop region between helices 2′ and 3 with no contacts to the AF-2 helix (61Oberfield J.L. Collins J.L. Holmes C.P. Goreham D.M. Cooper J.P. Cobb J.E. Lenhard J.M. Hull-Ryde E.A. Mohr C.P. Blanchard S.G. Parks D.J. Moore L.B. Lehmann J.M. Plunket K. Miller A.B. Milburn M.V. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6102-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In this context, it is intriguing that we observe specific binding of PPARα to palmitoyl-CoA immobilized via the CoA head group. If the palmitoyl-CoA entered the ligand-binding pocket via the channel between helix 3 and the β-sheet, this suggests that the orientation of palmitoyl-CoA mimicked that of GW0072. Alternatively, positioning of the palmitoyl-CoA molecule with the acyl chain in the characteristic tail-down configuration would imply that the acyl-CoA ligand entered the ligand-binding pocket via the AF-2 side. Interaction of PPARα with immobilized PPARα agonists would clearly be of interest to examine this possibility.Several genes are transcriptionally regulated by antagonistic cross-talk between PPAR and HNF-4α through a shared DNA binding motif (62Hertz R.

Commun. 1998; 242: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is well established that PPARα is activated by polyunsaturated fatty acids (23Göttlicher M Widmark E. Li Q. Gustafsson J.-Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4653-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 24Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar), and recently myristoyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA were reported to bind to HNF-4α and activate HNF-4α-mediated transactivation, whereas ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated acyl-CoA esters and stearoyl-CoA were shown to antagonize HNF-4α-mediated transactivation (65Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Based on this finding, it was proposed that the ratio of fatty acids to acyl-CoA esters and the composition of acyl-CoA esters might regulate cross-talk between PPARα and HNF-4α (65Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that recent data based on molecular modeling of HNF-4α and protease protection experiments have questioned the role of acyl-CoA esters in the regulation of HNF-4α activity (58Bogan A.A. Dallas-Yang Q. Ruse Jr, M.D. Maeda Y. Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Scanlan T.S. Cohen F.E. Sladek F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 831-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains to be established conclusively whether HNF-4α is a target for acyl-CoA-dependent regulation. If so, our findings add another level to the interplay between PPARα and HNF-4α, indicating that acyl-CoA esters, apart from activating HNF-4α, down-regulate PPARα-mediated transactivation via direct binding to PPARα, thereby imparting a conformation that reduces co-activator interaction and enhances recruitment of co-repressors (Fig.8). Members of the nuclear receptor superfamily mediate ligand-dependent transactivation of genes controlling development, differentiation, and homeostasis in response to nutritional, metabolic, and hormonal signals (1Mangelsdorf D.J.

We determined that AChE transcripts are barely detectable in cultured myoblasts and that their levels increase dramatically in myotubes. Nuclear run-on assays revealed that this increase was accompanied by a parallel induction in the transcriptional activity of the AChE gene. These changes in transcription were also observed in transfection experiments using AChE promoter-reporter gene constructs. Mutation of the intronic N-box at position +755 base pairs (bp) reduced by more than 70% expression of the reporter gene in myotubes. Disruption of an adjacent E-box, at position +767 bp, also reduced expression of the reporter gene following myogenic differentiation. Co-transfection experiments using AChE promoter-reporter gene constructs and a myogenin expression vector showed that expression of this regulatory factor increased expression of the reporter gene in myotubes. Although the AChE promoter contains multiple E-boxes, mutation of this intronic one was sufficient to prevent the myogenin-induced increase in reporter gene expression. Together, these results indicate that changes in AChE gene transcription occur during myogenesis and highlight the contribution of the intronic N- and E-box motifs in the developmental regulation of theAChE gene in skeletal muscle.

In both the central and peripheral nervous systems, it is responsible for the hydrolysis of acetylcholine released from nerve terminals thereby ensuring the efficiency of synaptic transmission. Although a single gene encodes AChE, several molecular forms can be generated as a result of alternative splicing and distinct post-translational processing (for reviews, see Refs. 1Massoulié J.

It has been previously suggested that this polymorphism allows for the expression of AChE catalytic subunits in different cell types and at various subcellular locations where specific molecular forms may perform site-specific functions (4Toutant J.P. Massoulié J. Kenney A.J. Turner A.J. Mammalian Ectoenzymes.in: Elsevier, Amsterdam1987: 289-328Google Scholar).In skeletal muscle, AChE expression is known to be markedly influenced by the state of differentiation and innervation of the muscle fibers. Numerous studies have indeed reported dramatic changes in the expression of the enzyme during myo- and synapto-genesis as well as in mature muscles following alterations in their normal levels of neuromuscular activity and/or in their basic supply of trophic factors. Given that AChE is an excellent marker of synaptic differentiation, several groups have recently begun to decipher the molecular basis underlying these changes in AChE expression. For example, increases in AChE mRNA expression have previously been reported during myogenic differentiation (5Fuentes M.E. Taylor P.

Nonetheless, alterations in the stability of pre-synthesized AChE transcripts have been suggested to account for at least a portion of the changes in mRNA levels seen during myogenic differentiation (5Fuentes M.E. Taylor P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 679-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Luo Z.D. Wang Y. Werlen G. Camp S. Chien K.R. Taylor P. Mol.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2250-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the contribution of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms has also been documented in several studies that examined expression of the AChE gene by nuclear run-on assays (13Boudreau-Larivière C. Chan R.Y.Y. Jasmin B.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2250-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Rimer M. Randall W.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and promoter analyses (16Mutero A. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 290: 951-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Together, these studies indicate therefore, that both transcriptional control mechanisms as well as post-transcriptional events contribute to the regulation of AChE mRNA levels in skeletal muscle cells.In this context, we have recently begun to examine the mechanisms underlying the preferential accumulation of AChE transcripts within the postsynaptic sarcoplasm of muscle fibers (see Refs. 11Michel R.N. Vu C.Q. Tetzlaff W. Jasmin B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17Chan R.Y. Boudreau-Larivière C. Angus L.M. Mankal F.A. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In these studies, we showed that the synaptic accumulation of AChE transcripts results, at least partially, from the local transcriptional activation of the AChE gene (17Chan R.Y. Boudreau-Larivière C. Angus L.M. Mankal F.A. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4627-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). By mutation/deletion analysis, we further demonstrated the key role of the first intron in regulating both the muscle-specific expression of the AChEgene as well as its preferential synaptic expression. In particular, our studies have shown the contribution of an intronic N-box motif and of the ets-related transcription factor GABP (see Refs.20Koike S. Schaeffer L. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10624-10628Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Duclert A. Savatier N. Schaeffer L. Changeux J.-P. J. Biol.

S. A. 1999; 96: 3223-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) in the synaptic regulation of the AChE gene in muscle fibers (17Chan R.Y. Boudreau-Larivière C. Angus L.M. Mankal F.A. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4627-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Given the key role of this intronic N-box in the regulation of AChE in adult skeletal muscle, we sought in the present study to determine whether this DNA element also participates in the control of the AChE gene during myogenic differentiation. In addition, we also examined whether other sites, located within the first intron, are also important in controlling AChE expression by focusing on an adjacent E-box motif.DISCUSSIONMyogenic differentiation is a developmentally regulated process characterized by a series of coordinated biochemical and morphological changes accompanied by the fusion of mononucleated myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes. Together with cytoskeletal and contractile proteins, expression of several synaptic proteins, including AChR, N-CAM, utrophin, and AChE, is also enhanced to varying degrees during myogenesis. In this context, previous studies have shown that, in the case of AChR (34Buonanno A. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11452-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Evans S. Goldman D. Heinemann S. Patrick J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4911-4916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Baldwin T.J. Burden S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2271-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 37Fontaine B. Changeux J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and utrophin (38Gramolini A.O. Jasmin B.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3603-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the increased expression of mRNAs can partially be attributed to an increase in the rate of transcription of these genes. Here, we show that transcription of theAChE gene is also increased during the early phases of myogenic differentiation. In fact, it appears that during the initial stages of muscle cell development, the rate of transcription of theAChE gene correlates well with the pattern of mRNA expression (compare undifferentiated myoblasts, confluent myoblasts, and 2-day-old myotubes in Figs. 1 and 2). In agreement with our findings, Rossi et al. (39Rossi S.G. Vazquez A. Rotundo R.L. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2000; 26: 1090Google Scholar) and R. L. Rotundo 2R. L. Rotundo, personal communication. have also reported recently an increase in the expression of the AChE gene that parallels the induction in AChE mRNA at early stages of chick muscle cell development. Thus, as originally suggested by Merlie and Sanes (40Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Nature. 1985; 317: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) as well as by Klarsfeld (41Klarsfeld A. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1987; 69: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), expression of genes encoding key synaptic proteins in muscle may indeed be coordinately regulated during myogenic differentiation.Together with the recent data obtained by Rossi et al. (39Rossi S.G. Vazquez A. Rotundo R.L. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2000; 26: 1090Google Scholar) and Rotundo,2 our results appear in contrast to the earlier findings of Taylor and colleagues (5Fuentes M.E. Taylor P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 679-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Luo Z.D. Wang Y. Werlen G. Camp S. Chien K.R. Taylor P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 886-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In their previous work, these investigators failed to detect an increase in the transcriptional activity of the AChE gene, thereby concluding that post-transcriptional mechanisms operating at the level of mRNA stability accounted for the increased AChE expression seen during myogenic differentiation. However, this discrepancy may be reconciled if we consider that, in their experimental approach, Taylor and co-workers focused on more advanced stages of myogenic differentiation during which maturational events are likely taking place. In support of this, it is important to note that we (present study) and Rossi et al. (39Rossi S.G. Vazquez A. Rotundo R.L. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2000; 26: 1090Google Scholar) and Rotundo2 all observed a decrease in the transcriptional activity of theAChE gene in older myotubes, an observation entirely consistent with the results of Taylor and colleagues who also detected a slight reduction in the expression of the AChE gene in fully differentiated myotubes (5Fuentes M.E. Taylor P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 679-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate therefore that transcriptional mechanisms participate in the regulation of AChE mRNA expression during myogenic differentiation but only at the earliest stages.As stated above, the increase in AChE mRNA expression that occurred in confluent myoblasts and 2-day-old myotubes can be solely explained by an increase in the transcriptional activity of the AChEgene. This increase in transcription appeared transient, because it returned toward control levels in older myotubes. At that stage however, AChE mRNA levels were further increased indicating, therefore, that post-transcriptional mechanisms likely account for this sustained increase. In this context, Taylor and colleagues have also implied an important contribution for post-transcriptional mechanisms during the later stages of muscle differentiation (5Fuentes M.E. Taylor P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 679-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Luo Z.D. Wang Y. Werlen G. Camp S. Chien K.R. Taylor P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 886-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In agreement with this view, it is relevant to note that recent studies performed in our laboratory have also illustrated the key role of the AChE 3′-untranslated repeat and of distinct RNA-binding proteins in regulating the stability of AChE transcripts in mature myotubes (42Bélanger G. Chan R.Y.Y. Jasmin B.J. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2000; 26: 1089Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate, therefore, that during the early stages of myogenic differentiation, transcriptional regulatory mechanisms play a predominant role in the control of AChE expression whereas the contribution of post-transcriptional events becomes more important at later stages. The concerted effects of these various mechanisms are likely important for the rapid increase in AChE expression in developing muscle cells and to ensure that this induction is well maintained in mature myotubes as to prepare them for the arrival of exploratory motor axons.Recently, a DNA element termed an N-box motif was identified (20Koike S. Schaeffer L. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10624-10628Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and shown to be critical for directing the preferential synaptic expression of genes encoding the acetylcholine receptor δ- (20Koike S. Schaeffer L. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10624-10628Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Fromm L. Burden S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3074-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and ε- (21Duclert A. Savatier N. Schaeffer L. Changeux J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 217: 17433-17438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (89) Google Scholar) subunits as well as the utrophin (24Gramolini A.O. Angus L.M. Schaeffer L. Burton E.A. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Changeux J.P. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3223-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and AChE(17Chan R.Y. Boudreau-Larivière C. Angus L.M. Mankal F.A. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4627-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) genes. Interestingly, in the case of the AChE gene, we noted that, although four N-boxes are located within 800 bp of the initiator element (two in the promoter region and two in the first intron; see Ref. 17Chan R.Y. Boudreau-Larivière C. Angus L.M. Mankal F.A. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4627-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the one located in the first intron at position +755 bp was critical for controlling the synapse-specific expression of the reporter gene. Given our results showing the transcriptional induction of the AChE gene during myogenic differentiation, we therefore became interested in determining whether this N-box also participated in the regulation of AChE expression in developing muscle cells. Our transfection experiments showed, in agreement with our nuclear run-on data, that indeed expression of the AChE gene is increased during myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, these experiments revealed the key role played by the intronic N-box in controlling expression of the AChE gene during differentiation of muscle cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the importance of the N-box motif during myogenic differentiation.Several recent studies have shown that the ets-related transcription factors GABP α and β can bind to the N-box motif to transactivate genes encoding synaptic proteins (17Chan R.Y. Boudreau-Larivière C. Angus L.M. Mankal F.A. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4627-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Fromm L. Burden S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3074-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Schaeffer L. Duclert N. Huchet-Dymanus M. Changeux J.-P. EMBO. 1998; 17: 3078-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24Gramolini A.O. Angus L.M. Schaeffer L. Burton E.A. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Changeux J.P. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2075-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether expression of GABP was affected during myogenic differentiation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that GABP-binding activity to the N-box was slightly increased in nuclear extracts from myotubes versusmyoblasts, and this was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Although the increase appears rather modest, it is important to note that the transactivation potential of GABP is also influenced by its phosphorylation status with stronger transcriptional activation occurring in the absence of an increase in DNA binding activity (22Fromm L. Burden S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3074-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results, together with the promoter analysis, further highlight the importance of the trans-acting element GABP and its corresponding cis-acting element, i.e. the N-box motif, in the expression of AChE during myogenic differentiation.The ets-related transcription factors often cooperate with other transcription factors (for reviews, see Refs. 44Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 211: 7-18Google Scholar, 45Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), including AP-1 (46Wasylyk B. Wasylyk C. Flores P. Begue A. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Nature. 1990; 346: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), or with cofactors such as the CREB-binding protein also known as CBP/p300 (47Bannert N. Avots A. Baier M. Serfling E. Kurth R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), to exert their effects. Becauseets-related factors, including GABP, may also possess a conserved domain with homology to basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors such as myogenic factors (48Seth A. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1761-1767PubMed Google Scholar), it appeared possible that GABP could in fact interact with myogenic factors to regulate expression of the AChE gene. This view appeared particularly attractive given the presence of an E-box in the immediate vicinity of the N-box motif at position +755 bp in the first intron of the AChE gene. Promoter analysis showed that indeed this E-box is crucial in regulating expression of the AChE gene during myogenic differentiation, because its mutation reduced by more than 90% expression of the reporter gene in transfected myotubes. Consistent with these findings, we further showed by co-transfection of AChE promoter-reporter gene constructs and a myogenin expression vector, that myogenin increases the expression of luciferase in myotubes. Remarkably, this effect was dependent upon a single E-box, because mutation of the intronic E-box prevented the myogenin-induced increase in reporter gene expression despite the presence of numerous E-boxes throughout the promoter region of the AChE gene (see Ref. 17Chan R.Y. Boudreau-Larivière C. Angus L.M. Mankal F.A. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4627-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our findings are therefore in agreement with the well-known effects of myogenic factors on expression of genes in differentiating muscle cells (for reviews, see Refs. 49Buckingham M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 506-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 50Arnold H.H. Winter B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 51Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). In addition, our direct plasmid injection in mouse TA muscles also showed that this E-box plays a critical role in regulating the basal level of expression of theAChE gene in vivo. Taken together with our previous study (17Chan R.Y. Boudreau-Larivière C. Angus L.M. Mankal F.A. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4627-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), these data clearly illustrate the importance of elements located within the first intron of the AChE gene in the control of its expression in skeletal muscle (see also Ref.52Luo Z.D. Camp S. Mutero A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28486-28495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)1 is widely recognized as an essential component of cholinergic synapses. In both the central and peripheral nervous systems, it is responsible for the hydrolysis of acetylcholine released from nerve terminals thereby ensuring the efficiency of synaptic transmission. Although a single gene encodes AChE, several molecular forms can be generated as a result of alternative splicing and distinct post-translational processing (for reviews, see Refs. 1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.-M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 2Taylor P. Radic Z. Ann. Rev. Pharmacol.

It has been previously suggested that this polymorphism allows for the expression of AChE catalytic subunits in different cell types and at various subcellular locations where specific molecular forms may perform site-specific functions (4Toutant J.P. Massoulié J. Kenney A.J. Turner A.J. Mammalian Ectoenzymes.in: Elsevier, Amsterdam1987: 289-328Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, AChE expression is known to be markedly influenced by the state of differentiation and innervation of the muscle fibers. Numerous studies have indeed reported dramatic changes in the expression of the enzyme during myo- and synapto-genesis as well as in mature muscles following alterations in their normal levels of neuromuscular activity and/or in their basic supply of trophic factors. Given that AChE is an excellent marker of synaptic differentiation, several groups have recently begun to decipher the molecular basis underlying these changes in AChE expression. For example, increases in AChE mRNA expression have previously been reported during myogenic differentiation (5Fuentes M.E. Taylor P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 679-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Jbilo O. L'Hermite Y. Talesa V. Toutant J.P. Chatonnet A. Eur. J.

Moreover, activity-induced changes in AChE transcript levels have been observed in both cultured myotubes as well as in skeletal muscle in vivo (10Cresnar B. Crne-Finderle N. Breskvar K. Sketelj J.

Together, these studies indicate therefore, that both transcriptional control mechanisms as well as post-transcriptional events contribute to the regulation of AChE mRNA levels in skeletal muscle cells. In this context, we have recently begun to examine the mechanisms underlying the preferential accumulation of AChE transcripts within the postsynaptic sarcoplasm of muscle fibers (see Refs. 11Michel R.N.

Data from gel-filtration high performance liquid chromatography and NMR has proven that SCM exists as a monomer in aqueous solution. In order to determine the structural origin of the taste of sweetness, we engineered several mutant SCM proteins by mutating Glu2, Asp7, and Arg39 residues, which are responsible for sweetness. In this study, we present the solution structure, backbone dynamics, and stability of mutant SCM proteins using circular dichroism, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy. Based on the NMR data, a stable α-helix and five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet were identified for double mutant SCM. Strands β1 and β2 are connected by a small bulge, and the disruption of the first β-strand were observed with SCMDR comprising residues of Ile38–Cys41. The dynamical and folding characteristics from circular dichroism, fluorescence, and backbone dynamics studies revealed that both wild type and mutant proteins showed distinct dynamical as well as stability differences, suggesting the important role of mutated residues in the sweet taste of SCM. Our results will provide an insight into the structural origin of sweet taste as well as the mutational effect in the stability of the engineered sweet protein SCM.

In this study, we present the solution structure, backbone dynamics, and stability of mutant SCM proteins using circular dichroism, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy. Based on the NMR data, a stable α-helix and five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet were identified for double mutant SCM. Strands β1 and β2 are connected by a small bulge, and the disruption of the first β-strand were observed with SCMDR comprising residues of Ile38–Cys41. The dynamical and folding characteristics from circular dichroism, fluorescence, and backbone dynamics studies revealed that both wild type and mutant proteins showed distinct dynamical as well as stability differences, suggesting the important role of mutated residues in the sweet taste of SCM. Our results will provide an insight into the structural origin of sweet taste as well as the mutational effect in the stability of the engineered sweet protein SCM. single-chain monellin nuclear Overhauser effect nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy total correlated spectroscopy double quantum-filtered correlated spectroscopy heteronuclear single quantum coherence simulated annealing heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effect guanidine hydrochloride restrained energy minimized The native sweet protein, monellin, which was originally isolated from the berries of the West African plant Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii (1van der Wel H. Biochem. Sensory Funct. 1976; 197: 235-242Google Scholar, 2Morris J.A. Cagan R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 261: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), consists of two separate polypeptide chains: an A chain of 45 residues, and a B chain of 50 residues. Native two-chain monellin is ∼70,000 times sweeter than sucrose and about 300 times sweeter than the dipeptide sweetener aspartame (3Brouwer J.N. Hellekant G. Kasahara Y. van der Wel H. Zotterman Y. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1973; 89: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 4Hough C.A.M. Edwardson J.A. Nature. 1978; 271: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Other sweet taste proteins, such as thaumatin, pentadin, and mabinlin, are also known (5Hellekant G. Glaser D. Brouwer J.N. van der Wel H. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1976; 97: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Morris J.A. Lloydia. 1976; 39: 25-38PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kurihara K. Beidler L.M.

Among these sweet proteins, a curculin protein has demonstrated a sweet taste and shown taste-modifying activity (10Yamadhita H. Theerasilp S. Ajuchi T. Nakaya K. Nakamura Y. Kurihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15770-15775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of native two-chain monellin has been determined as showing a β-sheet comprising five antiparallel strands and a single 17-residue long α-helix. The two chains were packed closely by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (11Ogata C. Hatada M. Tomlinson G. Shin W.C. Kim S.H. Nature. 1987; 328: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, the crystal structure showed that the amino terminus of the A chain was connected to the carboxyl terminus of the B chain through intermolecular hydrogen bond networks. Recent biochemical studies have reported that the A chain of the alcohol-denatured state of native monellin performed a structural reorganization from β-sheet to α-helix conversion in 50% ethanol and 50% trifluoroethanol environments (12Fan P. Bracken C. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, the conformational study for both native and mutated non-sweet analog two-chain monellin have been studied by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; these studies have shown that the three-dimensional structures of native monellin and two thiol proteinase inhibitors, cystatin and stefin B, are very similar (13Murzin A.Z. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These structural homology data indicated that monellin might play some other biological role in addition to its sweetness. An engineered 94-residue single-chain monellin (SCM),1 which was recently constructed by fusing the two chains to retain the topology of monellin (14Kim S.H. Kang C.H. Kim R. Cho J.M. Lee Y.B. Lee T.K. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), has proven to be as sweet as native monellin. Interestingly, SCM was more stable than the native two-chain monellin for both heat and acidic environments (14Kim S.H. Kang C.H. Kim R. Cho J.M. Lee Y.B. Lee T.K. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Very recently, two-dimensional 1H NMR (15Tomic M.T. Somoza J.R. Wemmer D.E. Park Y.W. Cho J.M. Kim S.H. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 557-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and heteronuclear three-dimensional NMR studies (16Lee S.Y. Lee J.H. Chang H.J. Cho J.M. Jung J.W. Lee W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2340-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) for recombinant SCM have been performed as a monomer conformation in solution state. The solution structure of SCM revealed that the long α-helix was folded into the concave side of a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and the common residues for all sweet peptides were mostly solvent-exposed. Interestingly, most of the residues involved in the sweet taste of monellin are found on the same surface of the molecule. In addition, the solution structure suggested that the relative orientation of the single α-helix might be responsible for the global topology of the molecule. The flexibilities of the side chains were also important for both sweet taste and receptor binding (16Lee S.Y. Lee J.H. Chang H.J. Cho J.M. Jung J.W. Lee W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2340-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is still not clear, however, whether SCM requires conformational preference for sweet taste, even though there is no doubt that the solution structure is responsible for binding as well as for sweet taste. Presented here are the solution structure, dynamical properties, and protein stability of single-chain monellins by heteronuclear NMR, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The recombinant SCM proteins were expressed in Escherichia colistrain BL21 (DE3) containing the plasmid pET21. Transformed cells were propagated in E. coli nitrogen base containing 5% glucose and 0.5% ammonium sulfate at 30 °C for 2 h and grown in M9 media containing 2% glucose and 0.1% ammonium sulfate at 30 °C for 48 h.15N-Labeled ammonium sulfate was used as the sole source of the nitrogen for uniformly 15N-labeled SCMDR and wild type SCM. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 25 min. Cells were stored at −80 °C and used for purification procedures. Cell pastes were disrupted by a bead beater in 25 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mmEDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at pH 7.0. The cell lysates were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 215 min. After pH adjustment and centrifugation, the supernatants were diluted with 10 mm sodium phosphate and loaded onto a CM-Sepharose column. The bound SCM was eluted with a salt gradient. The collected protein solution was dialyzed and dried with a freeze-dryer for spectroscopic measurements. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method. Fluorescence spectra were measured in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, at pH 7.0 and 25 °C, on F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 270 to 450 nm at each GdnHCl concentration using two different excitation wavelengths, 280 and 295 nm. The protein concentration in the cuvette was 30 μm, and a path length of 1 cm was used. GdnHCl-unfolding experiments were carried out after the protein was incubated in solutions containing different concentrations of the denaturant for 24 h, at 25 °C. The refolding reaction of SCM was carried out under various conditions by diluting the denaturant concentration. Data from the equilibrium denaturation were converted to plots offU versus denaturant concentration using Equation 1.fO=YO−(YF+mF[D])(YU+mU[D])−(YF+mF[D])Equation 1 Y O is the observed signal at a particular GdnHCl concentration. Y F andY U represent the intercepts, andm F and m U are the slopes of the native protein and the unfolded base lines. They were obtained by extrapolation of linear least-squares fits of the base lines. To determine whether the two-state unfolding model was appropriate for analyzing the GdnHCl-induced denaturation data,f U values were fitted to Equation 2.fU=exp[−(ΔGU+mG[D])/RT]1+exp[−(ΔGU+mG[D]/RT]Equation 2 In Equation 2, f U is related to ΔG U by a transformation of the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation in which the equilibrium constant for unfolding in the folding transition zone, K U, is given byK U = f U/(1 −f U), for a two-state transition. It is also implicit in Equation 2 that the free energy of unfolding is dependent linearly on denaturant concentration (17Agashe V.R. Udgaonkar J.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3286-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). CD spectra were measured in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, at pH 7.0 and 25 °C on a Jasco 720 spectropolarimeter. Far-UV CD spectra were monitored from 190 to 250 nm using a protein concentration of 30 μm with a path length of 0.1 mm, 20-millidegree sensitivity, response time of 1 s, and scan speed of 50 nm/min. The spectra were recorded as a six-scan average value. The molar ellipticity was determined as shown in Equation 3. θλ=θλ·Marc·1Equation 3 c is the protein concentration (in g/ml),l the light path length in the cell (in mm),θ λ the measured ellipticity (in degrees) at wavelength λ, and M ar the mean molecular mass of amino acid of the protein determined from its amino acid sequence. The temperature scanning CD measurements were carried out with a Jasco 715 spectropolarimeter from 25 °C to 100 °C using a cuvette of 0.2 mm for 222 nm wavelength. The heating rates were 30 °C/h with a step interval of 0.1 °C. Full CD spectra were collected at 20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, 70 °C, and 80 °C for far-UV region. Noise reduction was applied to thermal scan profiles of CD spectra and for determination of the transition midpoint temperatures (Tm), transitions analyzed on the basis of the two-state approximation were fitted to the following relation derived from the van't Hoff equation.fU=exp[−ΔHmvan/R(1/T−1/Tm)]1+exp[−ΔHmvan/R(1/T−1/Tm)]Equation 4 Reversibility was examined by comparing the transition curves of a sample that was briefly heated to a temperature where the protein was completely unfolded. All NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer in quadrature detection mode, equipped with a triple-resonance probe with an actively shielded pulsed field gradient coil. All two-dimensional experiments were performed at 298 K. Pulsed-field gradient techniques were used for all H2O experiments, resulting in good suppression of the solvent signal.15N-1H HSQC (18Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys.

Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar) spectra were collected to get vicinal coupling constant values. The 1H spectra were referenced to the water resonance at 4.76 ppm. Longitudinal (R 1) and transversal (R 2) relaxation data for the backbone15N nuclei of wild type SCM were recorded as 2048 × 64 data sets with 64 scans/point using 1 s of a recovery delay. Seven different values for the relaxation time were used:t 1 = 5, 65, 145, 246, 366, 527, and 757 ms andt 2 = 8.3, 25.1, 41.8, 58.6, 75.3, 108.8, and 142.3 ms. To permit estimation of noise levels, duplicate spectra were recorded for t = 246 ms (t 1spectra) and t = 56.8 ms (t 2spectra). In order to eliminate the effects of cross correlation between 15N-1H dipolar and 15N chemical shift anisotropy relaxation mechanisms, 1H 180° pulses were inserted during the relaxation time according to the published methods (27Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar, 28Skelton N.J. Palmer A.G. Akke M. Kordel J. Rance M. Chazin W.J. J. Magn.

Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) data were also obtained using a relaxation delay of 5 s. The NMR data were processed using the nmrPipe/NMRDraw software packages (Biosym/Molecular Simulations, Inc.) and analyzed using Sparky 3.60 software. The experimental data were extended by linear prediction and zero-filled to give 2048 × 512 data matrices and processed using gaussian multiplication and a shifted (π/3) sine bell function prior to Fourier transformation. The peak intensities in the two-dimensional spectra were measured by peak heights using the Sparky program. The XNOE value for a given residue was calculated as the intensity ratio (I/I 0) of the15N-1H correlation peak in the presence (I) and absence (I 0) of 3-s proton saturation. The standard deviations of these values were measured background noise levels. Relaxation rates were determined by nonlinear fits of the time dependence of the peak intensities. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to estimate the uncertainty of the relaxation parameters. Structures were generated using hybrid distance geometry and dynamical simulated annealing protocol with the CNS 1.0 program on a SGI Indigo2 work station. Our methodology was similar to that used by Clore and Gronenborn (31Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 32Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) and their co-workers. Distance geometry substructures were generated using a subset of atoms in the peptide and followed a refinement protocol described by Lee et al. (33Lee W. Moore C.H. Watt D.D. Krishna N.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 218: 89-95Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The target function for molecular dynamics and energy minimization consisted of a covalent structure, van der Waals repulsion, NOE, and torsion angle constraints (34Driscoll P.C. Gronenborn A.M. Beress L. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2188-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The torsion angle and NOE constraints were represented by square-well potentials. Based on cross-peak intensities in the NOESY spectra with mixing times of 100 and 150 ms, the distance restraints were then classified as strong, medium, or weak corresponding to upper distance bounds of 2.7, 3.3, and 5.0 Å, respectively. An additional 1 Å was added to upper distance bounds for pseudoatom involving non-stereospecifically assigned methylene protons, methyl groups, and the ring protons of phenylalanine residue (35Wuthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). A lower distance bound of 1.8 Å was used for all NOE-derived distance restraints. Structures were calculated using 296 intraresidues, 245 sequential, 124 medium range, and 331 long range NOE restraints. A total of 76 hydrogen bond restraints were also included in the calculations. Potential hydrogen bond donors were assigned from a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum recorded immediately after dissolving lyophilized H2O sample to 100% D2O solution. Hydrogen bonds were further identified from characteristic NOE patterns that were observed for residues in regular secondary structure, together with the solvent exchange data. From two-dimensional DQF-COSY (36Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nilges M. Ryan C.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8012-8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 37Wagner G. Braun W. Havel T.F. Schaumann T. Go N. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 611-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) and 15N-edited HNHA spectra, 65 torsion angle restraints were also derived for backbone Φ-angles within elements of secondary structure based on 3 J HNαcoupling-constants (3 J HNα > 8, 120 (± 50)°,3 J HNα < 6, 60 (±45)°). Distance geometry substructures were generated using a subset of atoms in the peptide, and followed a refinement protocol described by Lee et al. (33Lee W. Moore C.H. Watt D.D. Krishna N.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 218: 89-95Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All modeling calculations were performed within the InsightII program (Biosym/Molecular Simulations, Inc.) on a SGI Indigo2 work station. Circular dichroic spectra of both wild type and double mutant proteins in the far-UV region were collected in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.0. The spectra suggest that the global folding of the two proteins are similar, showing a major β-strand and minor α-helical contents. However, a small difference at 217 nm was clearly detected, indicating that the structural change of the β-sheet region was due to double mutation of SCM. The additional minima observed at 206–208 nm have been ascribed from the contributions of aromatic side chains (38Krishnagopal M. Swapan K.B. Bireswar C. Roland J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 832: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 39Woody R.W. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1451-1467Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Spin system assignments were easily made by homonuclear two-dimensional TOCSY and15N-edited 3D TOCSY-HSQC spectra. All identified spin systems served as a starting point for complete sequence-specific resonance assignment procedure. Fig. 2shows two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum with the assignments. A total of 50 substructures generated from distance geometry algorithms were used as starting structures in the simulated annealing stage. After simulated annealing calculations, the 20 structures (〈SA〉k) showed no constraint violations greater than 0.5 Å for distances and 5° for torsional angles. These structures were used for detailed structural analysis. Table I shows the energy and structural statistics of the final 20 simulated annealing structures related to experimental constraints. The final 〈SA〉kstructures were well converged with a root mean square deviation of 0.96 Å for all backbone atoms, 0.61 Å for backbone atoms except for disordered regions (Gly1–Trp3, Glu48–Ile53, and Asp76–Arg82), and 0.49 Å for residues involved in secondary structures. The REM average structure (〈SA〉kr) from 20 final structures exhibited a root mean square deviation of 0.99 Å for backbone atoms with respect to 20 〈SA〉kstructures and 0.64 Å for backbone atoms excluding unstructured regions (Gly1–Trp3, Glu48–Ile53, Asp76–Arg82). TableII summarizes the structural statistics associated with 20 final 〈SA〉kstructures of SCMDR. The deviations from idealized geometry are also very small and satisfy ideal geometry. The 〈SA〉kr structure clearly demonstrates the relative orientations of its major secondary structures, showing that the twisted β-sheet partially wrapped the beginning of the α-helix. Especially, the bend of three strands (β2, β3, and β4) enable to have a close contacts with the α-helix. A best fit backbone superposition of all final 〈SA〉k structures with an average REM structure is displayed in Fig. 3. The angular order parameter for Φ, Ψ, which indicates the degree of dihedral heterogeneity of structures, showed that the Φ, Ψ values of all residues except prolines and residues of Gly30–Thr33 and Ile8 in loop regions are close to 1, suggesting the well defined backbone angles of SCMDR (data not shown). The backbone torsion angles Φ, Ψ for the 〈SA〉kr ensured that all of the Φ, Ψ values of final 20 structures were distributed in energetically favorable regions. The ribbon diagram of the REM average structure clearly shows that the general topology consisted of both a single long α-helix and a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Fig.4). Five loops including an engineered one were also characterized. The side chain orientations of Tyr63 and Asp66, which are common to all sweet peptides and correspond to Phe and Asp residues of aspartame, were observed on the opposite side to the H1 helix and those that were mostly exposed to solvent.Table IStructural statistics for the 20 final simulated annealing structures of SCMDRParameter〈SA〉k〈SA〉krA.

A high flexibility around an engineered loop and structural rearrangements of β-sheet due to double mutation were observed, even though the overall three-dimensional structure of the SCMDRis similar to that of the wild type. The emission spectra of the SCM at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm in the various GdnHCl concentrations are shown in Fig.6 A. The emission spectrum of the SCM was dominated by the tryptophan fluorescence. In the unfolding process, spectra exhibited two emission peaks, corresponding to the contribution of tyrosine and tryptophan residues based on the tyrosine-tryptophan energy transfer mechanism. The efficiency of energy transfer can be used to estimate the distances between the donor and acceptor. The fluorescence energy transfer transition curve was measured using denaturant GdnHCl and the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 298 nm corresponding to tyrosine fluorescence and at 350 nm to tryptophan fluorescence. It can be seen that GdnHCl-induced denaturation begins at 2.0 m concentration and fully denatures at 3.4 m GdnHCl. Fig. 6 B shows that the fractional change of unfolding suggests a two-state model for GdnHCl-induced denaturation of both SCMDR and wild type protein. However, the transition midpoint of the double mutant SCM has shifted slightly toward the left, implying that the double mutation induces destabilization of the protein. In each case, the reversibility of the unfolding reaction was confirmed by obtaining a refolding curve through dilution of the protein from high GdnHCl concentration. The denaturation and renaturation curves are determined to be exactly superimposable. The rotational diffusion anisotropy was estimated for each residue, yielding a ratio of the principal moments of inertia of SCMDR as 1.00:0.86:0.40. These data suggest that the global shape of SCMDR is a prolate ellipsoid. Using data fromR 2/R 1 ratios and structural coordinates of 66 selected residues, axial diffusion tensors,D ⊥/D ∥, were also calculated. The starting values of the parameters τm andD ⊥/D ∥ were 4.9 ns and 0.65 at 500 MHz, respectively. The standard values ofR 1, R 2, and15N-(1H) NOEs were fitted in the model-free system selected by an F-test. Fig.7 demonstrates that the regions of the secondary structures showed higher S 2 values than those of loops, as we expected. The average values ofS 2 are above 0.94 for most residues in β-strands and above 0.98 for α-helical region. More than 80% of the residues in SCMDR have order parameterS 2 values greater than 0.8, indicating that the protein in general is relatively rigid. Five residues (Glu4, Ile5, Thr33, Tyr47, and Arg82) belonged to the loop regions showed relatively higherR 2/R 1 ratios, originated from a significant chemical exchange contribution (Fig. 7 A). In addition to this exchange contribution, residues of Glu4and Ile6 exhibited a significant reduction in the15N-(1H) NOEs and S 2values of 0.7 and 0.69 (Fig. 7 B). Thus, it can be supposed that both Glu4 and Ile5 residues might be involved in dynamical motions. Four residues of Ile5, Tyr47, Arg51, and Asp66 located in the loop regions contained τe contributions, indicating enhanced backbone dynamics on a fast time scale. In the previous report, we determined that SCM exists as a monomer conformation based on NMR and gel-filtration experiments. Solution structure suggested that Arg70 and Arg86residues have a close correlation with the degree of sweetness of SCM protein. A comparison of the secondary structure of SCMDR with wild type protein indicates that the structural difference between the two proteins can be observed mainly in β-strands. The first short β-strand composed of residues Glu2–Ile5 found in the wild type SCM was not detected in SCMDR. Amide hydrogen exchange data, backbone-backbone NOEs, and CαH chemical shift indices did not provide any evidence of support β-strand in this region. Therefore, it can be supposed that a mutation of Asp7disrupts the first short strand, perturbating the stability of the network of β-strand. The main structural differences are the following; each β-strand encompasses 6 residues from Cys41 to Ile46 for a second β-strand, 9 residues from Gly55 to Tyr63 for a third, and 6 residues from Arg70 to Glu75 for a fourth β-strand, whereas 7 residues from Cys41 to Tyr47, 11 residues from Lys54 to Ala64, and 7 residues from Phe69 to Glu75 constitute each third, fourth, and fifth β-strand in wild type SCM. Several reports have already proposed that a sulfhydryl group of Cys41 in the beginning of β3 strand could be critical for sweetness. In our solution structures of both wild type SCM and SCMDR, the side chain of Cys41 is located on the hydrophobic interface between β-sheet and α-helix. We propose that the side chain of Cys41 plays a role for sweetness because it maintains a bulge between Ile38 and Cys41 responsible for structural organization, especially the H1 helix orientation and, furthermore, the tertiary structure of single chain monellin. We also proposed that hydrophobic and/or side chain-side chain interaction related to tertiary structure of SCM is in part responsible for sweetness. Mutational studies of SCM proteins have supported our structural data, showing that the size of Asp7 residue in loop A is important for sweetness (Fig.8). Our structure showed that Asp7 and Arg39 residues, which reside on the same surface of the protein, are involved in charge-charge interaction, causing structural instability from mutations of these residues. This instability is also proven from the data of thermal unfolding experiments of SCM proteins (Fig. 9). The midpoint of denaturation temperature (Tm) of SCMDR was determined to be significantly less than that of the wild type. In addition, our data suggest that the secondary structures and stability of tertiary structure were closely correlated with mutations of Asp7 and Arg39 residues. We thought that the H1 helix would be responsible for the general topology as well as the side chain orientations of the key residues involved in sweetness. Therefore, we can conclude that, even though amino acids located in the loop regions are mainly involved in biological activity of monellin, both the relative orientations of those side chains based on tertiary structure and protein stability are of importance for the sweet taste of the SCM protein.Figure 9The thermal unfolding transitions of wild type SCM (T m = 359 K, ●) and SCMDR(T m = 348 K, ○) monitored by the decrease of the CD signal at 222 nm are displayed.

We have used55Fe-labeled NifB-co, the specific iron and sulfur donor to FeMo-co, to investigate the accumulation of protein-bound precursors of FeMo-co. The 55Fe label from radiolabeled NifB-co became associated with two major protein bands when the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reaction was carried out with the extract of an Azotobacter vinelandii mutant lacking apodinitrogenase. One of the bands, termed55Fe-labeled upper band, was purified and shown to be NifH by immunoblot analysis. The 55Fe-labeled lower band was identified as NifX by N-terminal sequencing. NifX purified from anA. vinelandii nifB strain showed a different electrophoretic mobility on anoxic native gels than did NifX with the FeMo-co precursor bound.

LeComte J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 56: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 2Hageman R.V. Burris R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). During catalysis, dinitrogenase (also called MoFe protein or NifKD)1 is specifically reduced by dinitrogenase reductase (Fe-protein or NifH), one electron at a time, until a sufficient number of electrons accumulates on dinitrogenase for the subsequent reduction of substrate (3Burris R.H. Roberts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 317-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Dinitrogenase reductase, an α2 dimer of thenifH gene product, contains one 4Fe-4S cluster which is symmetrically coordinated by the thiol groups of Cys-97 and Cys-132 from each subunit of the homodimer (4Georgiadis M.M.

Chem. 1983; 258: 13486-13492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dinitrogenase is an α2β2 tetramer of the nifDand K gene products and is associated with two unique metal clusters: the P-cluster (6Kim J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1677-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar) and the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co) (6Kim J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1677-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 7Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3249-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). FeMo-co is the active site in dinitrogenase where substrate reduction is believed to occur and is composed of a MoFe3-S3 cluster bridged to a Fe4-S3 cluster by three sulfur ligands. The molybdenum atom is also coordinated to the C-2 carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of the organic acid R-homocitrate. Biochemical and genetic analyses of A. vinelandii andKlebsiella pneumoniae mutants have revealed that the biosynthesis of FeMo-co requires the participation of at least seven different nif gene products: NifQ, V, B, H, X, N, and E (8Hoover T.R.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2797-2801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the products of the structural genes for dinitrogenase, nifD and K, are not necessary for FeMo-co biosynthesis, suggesting that the cofactor is assembled elsewhere in the cell and then is inserted into the FeMo-co-deficient apodinitrogenase (13Ugalde R.A. Imperial J. Shah V.K. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 888-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Imperial J. Shah V.K. Ugalde R.A. Ludden P.W. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1784-1786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of apodinitrogenase (NifKD), it is known that FeMo-co accumulates on a non-nif protein, gamma (γ), that serves as a chaperone-insertase during FeMo-co biosynthesis and its insertion into NifKD (15Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An in vitroreaction for the biosynthesis of FeMo-co has been described that requires the presence of an ATP-regenerating system, MoO42−, homocitrate, NifB-cofactor (NifB-co), and the gene products of nifH, N, andE (11). However, the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis system involving only purified proteins and components that are known for FeMo-co synthesis has not yielded significant levels of FeMo-co synthesis, thereby suggesting the requirement for other factors in this process (12Shah V.K. Rangaraj P. Chatterjee R. Allen R.M. Roll J.T. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2797-2801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because FeMo-co is unstable in aqueous solutions, intermediates in the FeMo-co biosynthetic pathway are believed to be present as protein-bound species. The accumulation of molybdenum in the FeMo-co biosynthetic pathway has been studied in various nif mutants of K. pneumoniae (13Ugalde R.A. Imperial J. Shah V.K. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 888-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and A. vinelandii (16Allen R.M. Roll J.T. Rangaraj P. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15869-15874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) as an approach to identify the sequence of steps in the FeMo-co biosynthetic pathway. Previous studies have identified the metabolic product of NifB, NifB-co, as a potential iron and sulfur source for FeMo-co biosynthesis (17Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with purified55Fe-labeled NifB-co have conclusively shown that NifB-co serves as the specific iron and sulfur donor to FeMo-co (18Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nifB is one of the nif genes that is required for the full activity of the Mo-independent nitrogen fixation systems (19Joerger R.D. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1475-1487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, NifB-co is proposed to function as the fundamental iron-sulfur cluster for the synthesis of FeMo-co of Mo-nitrogenase, FeV-co of V-nitrogenase, and FeFe-co of Fe-only-nitrogenase. To identify proteins that play a role in FeMo-co biosynthesis, we have used 55Fe-labeled NifB-co in the in vitroFeMo-co synthesis reaction. We have followed the incorporation of the radiolabel into FeMo-co and its precursors by electrophorescing the reaction mixtures on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and detecting the radiolabeled protein bands by phosphorimaging analysis. Here, we report the accumulation of a radiolabeled species on NifH under conditions in which FeMo-co synthesis is allowed to take place. Another protein, NifX, also accumulates the radiolabel from55Fe-labeled NifB-co under similar conditions. All materials used for growth medium preparation were of analytical grade.

All glassware was rinsed with 4 n HCl overnight to remove traces of contaminating iron and then rinsed thoroughly with deionized water. A 25-ml starter culture of strain CA11.1 was grown in Burk's modified medium (22Strandberg G.W. Wilson P.W. Can. J. Microbiol. 1968; 14: 14-25Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar) in the presence of 18 μm unlabeled iron and 400 μg of nitrogen/ml in the form of ammonium acetate at 30 °C for 20–24 h in a rotary shaker. One milliliter of this culture was used as the inoculum for each of six 250-ml cultures, each containing 9 μm iron and 400 μg fixed nitrogen/ml. The cultures were grown for 20–24 h, and the cells were then collected by centrifugation. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellets were resuspended in fresh medium containing 9 μm iron, 2 mCi of 55FeCl3 (18.5–20 mCi/ml) and with no source of fixed nitrogen. 55Fe was added to the cultures as ferric citrate, prepared according to the procedure described previously (18Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The cultures were derepressed for 4 h after which the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets were stored at −80 °C. Typically about 60–75% of the radioactivity was incorporated into the cells. All buffers were sparged with nitrogen for 20–30 min and degassed on a gassing manifold three times, with alternating cycles of vacuum and flushing with argon gas. Sodium dithionite (DTH) was added to a final concentration of 1.7 mm. Buffers used for protein purification contained 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was used throughout as the buffer unless otherwise stated. NifB-co was purified from the cell-free extracts of unlabeled and 55Fe-grown A. vinelandii mutant CA11.1 (ΔnifHDKΔvnfDGK::spc) according to published procedures (17Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). FeMo-co synthesis reactions were carried out as described by Shah et al. (11Shah V.K. Imperial J. Ugalde R.A. Ludden P.W. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1636-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To 9-ml serum vials flushed with purified argon and rinsed with anaerobic Tris-HCl buffer were added the following: 100 μl of anaerobic Tris-HCl, 10 nmol of sodium molybdate, 100 nmol of homocitrate, 200 μl of an ATP-regenerating mixture (containing 3.6 mm ATP, 6.3 mm MgCl2, 51 mm creatine phosphate, 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 6.3 mm DTH), 200 μl of the appropriate A. vinelandii extract, and 10 μl of a solution containing purified55Fe-labeled NifB-co (60,000 cpm). The total volume of the reaction mixture was 555 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. After incubation, the samples to be applied to native polyacrylamide gels were placed on ice. Purified apodinitrogenase (the α2β2γ2form, 50 μg of total protein) was added to certain reaction mixtures. Acetylene reduction was initiated in the remainder of the vials by the addition of excess MgATP, purified NifH (0.1 mg of protein), and 0.5 ml of acetylene. Nitrogenase activity was then quantitated by acetylene reduction as described elsewhere (11Shah V.K. Imperial J. Ugalde R.A. Ludden P.W. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1636-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A 1200-fold scale-up of the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reaction containing the extract of strain CA117.3 and55Fe-NifB-co was performed as follows. Thirty 100-ml vials were stoppered and degassed thoroughly on a gassing manifold four times and rinsed with anoxic Tris-HCl buffer. To each vial were added the following: 2 ml of anoxic Tris-HCl containing 1 mm DTH, 0.4 ml of 5 mm homocitrate, 0.2 ml of 1 mm sodium molybdate, 8 ml of an ATP-regenerating mixture (as described earlier), 8 ml of extract of strain CA117.3 (ΔnifDKΔnifB), 0.4 ml of purified unlabeled NifB-co solution (equivalent to 200 nmol of Fe), and 0.1 ml of purified55Fe-NifB-co solution (6 × 106 cpm/ml). The vials were placed in a rotary shaker and were gently shaken at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were pooled after the incubation period and applied to a 93-ml DEAE-cellulose column (2.5 × 19 cm) equilibrated with anoxic Tris-HCl containing 0.1m NaCl. The column was washed with 100 ml of the same buffer, and proteins were eluted from the column using a step gradient of 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, and 0.5 m NaCl in the above buffer containing 20% glycerol. The presence of upper and lower bands was determined by subjecting aliquots of the DEAE-cellulose column fractions to anoxic, native gel electrophoresis, and phosphorimaging analyses. The upper band was found to elute with buffer containing 0.25 m NaCl, whereas the lower band eluted with buffer containing 0.35 m NaCl. The DEAE-cellulose fractions containing the upper band were separated and pooled from those containing the lower band. The upper band- and lower band-containing pools were separately concentrated down to 12 ml using an Amicon system fitted with a PM-10 membrane and subjected to Sephadex G-75 column (2.5 × 95 cm) chromatography. The column was equilibrated with anoxic Tris-HCl containing 0.05 m NaCl and 10% glycerol. Ten-milliliter fractions were collected, and those containing the upper band, as determined by anoxic gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging analysis, were pooled and brought to 1m (NH4)2SO4. This was applied to a 1- × 10-cm phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with 1m (NH4)2SO4 in Tris-HCl, washed with one column volume of the same buffer, and protein was eluted stepwise with two column volumes each of 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 0.025, and 0.0 m(NH4)2SO4. The upper band-containing fractions (0.25 m(NH4)2SO4)) were pooled, diluted 2-fold with anoxic Tris-HCl, and concentrated by ultrafiltration using the same membrane as stated above. The sample produced in this manner was not homogeneously pure, so ∼1 ml of this sample was subjected to preparative anoxic native gel electrophoresis; the region of the gel containing radioactivity was sliced, and the protein was then eluted from the acrylamide, as described below. The Sephadex G-75 fractions containing the 55Fe-labeled lower band were pooled and subjected to phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography, as described above. The lower band containing fractions (0.5–0.25 m (NH4)2SO4) were then pooled and concentrated using an Amicon system fitted with a PM-10 membrane. One milliliter of this concentrate was applied to a preparative anoxic native gel, and the region of the gel containing radioactivity was sliced. The protein from the gel was eluted as described below. A SDS gel of the elute showed an 18-kDa protein. The protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and N-terminal sequencing was performed at the Protein/Peptide Micro Analytical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology (Pasadena, CA). NifX was partially purified from an A. vinelandii nifB strain, CA11.3 (ΔnifHDKΔnifB::kan). The cell-free extract of 100 g of cells was applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (4 × 15 cm), equilibrated with anoxic Tris-HCl containing 0.1 m NaCl and 20% glycerol. The column was washed with 1 column volume of the same buffer, and proteins were eluted stepwise with 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, and 0.5 m NaCl contained in the buffer described above. The presence of NifX was determined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis followed by immunoblot analysis of the fractions using anti-NifX antibody. The fractions containing NifX (0.15 m NaCl elute) were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon system fitted with a XM100A membrane. The concentrate (15 ml) was then chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-100 column (2.5 × 96 cm), equilibrated with buffer containing anoxic Tris-HCl, 0.05m NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The fractions containing NifX, as determined by immunoblot analysis, were pooled and applied to a Q-Sepharose column (1.5 × 12.5 cm), equilibrated with buffer containing anoxic Tris-HCl and 0.1 m NaCl. The column was washed with 25 ml of the above buffer, and protein was eluted stepwise with one column volume each of 0.15, 0.35, and 0.5 m of NaCl in Tris-HCl. The NifX-containing fractions (0.35 melute) were pooled, brought to 1 m in (NH4)2SO4, and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (1 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 1m (NH4)2SO4 in Tris-HCl. The column was washed with 12 ml of the same buffer, and protein was eluted stepwise with 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and 0.0m (NH4)2SO4 in Tris-HCl. The fractions containing NifX (0.5 and 0.25 m(NH4)2SO4) were pooled and frozen as pellets in liquid nitrogen. The activity of the partially purified NifX was followed by use of the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assay using the extract of the strain DJ42.48 (ΔnifENXΔvnfX), as described previously (12Shah V.K. Rangaraj P. Chatterjee R. Allen R.M. Roll J.T. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2797-2801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FeMo-co was purified as described by Shah and Brill (7Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3249-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Dinitrogenase and NifH were purified as previously described (23Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 305: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Apodinitrogenase was purified from strain UW45 (nifB) as described by Paustian et al. (24Paustian T.D. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3515-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and NifNE was purified from strain CA117.3 (ΔnifDKΔnifB) as described by Roll et al. (25Roll J.T. Shah V.K. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4432-4437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). O2treatment of cell-free extracts and various purified components was performed by exposure of the samples to air for 10 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. Following this, the samples were made anaerobic by thoroughly degassing the stoppered vials on a gassing manifold with alternating cycles of vacuum and flushing with Ar gas. DTH was added to a final concentration of 1.7 mm. Apodinitrogenase (25 μg of total protein) purified from A. vinelandii strain UW45 (nifB −) was incubated with the partially purified 55Fe-NifX (5000 cpm) and purified NifH (4.5 μg of protein) in an anoxic, stoppered 9-ml vial. The total volume of the reaction mixture was 170 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, after which 100 μl was subjected to anoxic, native gel electrophoresis. For the C2H2reduction assay, 800 μl of ATP-regenerating mixture and 0.5 ml of C2H2 were added to the reaction mixture (as described above), and nitrogenase activity was then quantitated as described elsewhere (11Shah V.K.

The gel slices containing either 55Fe-labeled upper or lower bands were placed in clean 10-ml culture tubes to which 2 ml of the elution buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mmEDTA and 150 mm NaCl) were added. The gel slices were crushed with a clean pestle, and the tubes were shaken in a rotary shaker at 30 °C overnight. The solutions were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were removed into Eppendorf tubes, to which an equal volume of SDS-sample buffer was added. The entire procedure was performed under aerobic conditions. SDS-PAGE was performed as described (12Shah V.K. Rangaraj P. Chatterjee R. Allen R.M. Roll J.T. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2797-2801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a 2.8% stacking gel and a 12% resolving gel. The proteins were electrophoresed at 100 V until the bromphenol blue entered the resolving gel and then electrophoresed at 200 V until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel. Low molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were used. Proteins were separated on anaerobic native gels with a 7–20% acrylamide and 0–20% sucrose gradient as previously described (26Rüttimann-Johnson C.

Native gels were stained for iron as described previously (27Kuo C.-F. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Antibodies to the various proteins were prepared at the University of Wisconsin antibody facility. The protocols for immunoblotting and developing with modifications by Brandner et al. (28Brandner J.P. McEwan A.G. Kaplan S. Donohue T. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 360-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been described. Gels were exposed to a phosphor screen for 1–2 days and were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics Model 425e PhosphorImager. FeMo-co is unstable in aqueous solutions; thus it is likely that precursors of FeMo-co accumulate on proteins during the course of cofactor biosynthesis. Though use of the in vitroFeMo-co biosynthesis system has yielded considerable information regarding the biosynthesis of FeMo-co, not much is known about the proteins that are associated with precursors of the cofactor. Previous studies with 55Fe- and 35S-labeled NifB-co have shown that NifB-co serves as a specific iron and sulfur donor to FeMo-co (18Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The in vitro FeMo-co synthesis system, together with native anoxic gel electrophoresis, was employed to monitor the incorporation of radiolabel from purified55Fe-labeled NifB-co into FeMo-co and its precursors. Our strategy for the identification of proteins that accumulate FeMo-co precursors was as follows: (i) perform in vitro FeMo-co biosynthesis in the presence of purified 55Fe-NifB-co, (ii) separate the proteins on anoxic native gels, and (iii) visualize proteins accumulating radiolabel by phosphorimaging analyses of these gels. One limitation in this procedure is that only precursor·protein complexes that are sufficiently stable to survive non-denaturing gel electrophoresis can be visualized. The in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reaction was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” by the addition of purified 55Fe-labeled NifB-co to extracts of A. vinelandii strains carrying deletion of one or more genes that are required for FeMo-co synthesis. The results of this study are illustrated in Fig.1. Upon the addition of55Fe-labeled NifB-co to an in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reaction mixture containing the extract of an A. vinelandii strain carrying a lesion of nifB (strain UW45), FeMo-co is synthesized and inserted into apodinitrogenase forming dinitrogenase (Fig. 1, lane 1), the migration of which was identified by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). A C2H2 reduction activity of 5.0 nmol/min/mg of protein was obtained for this reaction, consistent with the formation of holodinitrogenase. We estimate that this activity is equivalent to greater than 10% of the specific activity of a crude extract of wild-type A. vinelandii. Furthermore, this represents an activity equivalent to our best in vitro FeMo-co synthesis. A reaction mixture containing the extract of strain CA117.3 (ΔnifDKΔnifB) showed the incorporation of the radiolabel from 55Fe-NifB-co into a faster-migrating species (Fig. 1, lane 2), identified as NifNE by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Two other faster-migrating radiolabeled bands were observed apart from the radiolabel associated with NifNE, which were named as 55Fe-labeled upper andlower bands, as shown in Fig. 1 (lane 2). It is essential to note that strain CA117.3 is able to support FeMo-co synthesis upon the addition of NifB-co alone, because NifKD proteins are not required for cofactor biosynthesis (13Ugalde R.A. Imperial J. Shah V.K. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 888-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Imperial J. Shah V.K. Ugalde R.A. Ludden P.W. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1784-1786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results from previous studies indicate that completed FeMo-co is bound by the gamma protein (15Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of FeMo-co bound to gamma (γ ·FeMo-co) is expected when the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reaction is carried out with the extract of strain CA117.3. However, under the electrophoretic conditions used in this study, completed FeMo-co bound to γ comigrated with the upper band and was separated during the course of purification of theupper band (data not shown). Upon the addition of purified apodinitrogenase (α2β2γ2) to the reaction mixture containing the extract of strain CA117.3, the incorporation of the radiolabel into dinitrogenase was observed (Fig.1, lane 3), suggesting that FeMo-co had been synthesized and inserted into the added apodinitrogenase. This is supported by a C2H2 reduction activity of 4.7 nmol/min/mg of protein for this reaction. Strain CA11.3 (ΔnifHDKΔnifB::kan) showed the incorporation of the radiolabel from55Fe-NifB-co into NifNE and into one of the faster-migrating bands termed lower band (Fig. 1, lane 4) but not into the upper band. This suggested that the presence of NifH was required for the accumulation of the radiolabel on the band termed upper band. Note that the only difference between the CA117.3 and CA11.3 genotypes is the presence or absence ofnifH; the nifH gene is present in strain CA117.3 and is deleted in strain CA11.3. When the strain CA142 (ΔnifDKYΔnifENX::kan) was used in the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reaction, no incorporation of the radiolabel from 55Fe-NifB-co into either the upper or the lower bands could be observed, suggesting that NifNE or NifX or both may be required for the incorporation of radiolabel into these bands (Fig. 1, lane 5). A reaction mixture containing the extract of the wild-type UW strain grown in presence of excess fixed nitrogen (nif-repressed) did not show either the upper or lower bands, suggesting that nif proteins were required for the incorporation of radiolabel from 55Fe-NifB-co into the above-mentioned bands (Fig. 1, lane 6). A slow-migrating protein that incorporated 55Fe-label from radiolabeled NifB-co was observed in extracts"

The DNA binding activity of p53 protein is crucial for its tumor suppressor function. DNA interactions of active wild-type human p53 protein with DNA fragments and oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplexes modified by antitumor cisplatin and its clinically ineffective trans isomer (transplatin) were investigated by using a gel mobility shift assay. It was found that DNA adducts of cisplatin reduced binding affinity of the consensus DNA sequence to p53, whereas transplatin adducts did not. This result was interpreted to mean that the precise steric fit required for the formation and stability of the tetrameric complex of p53 with the consensus sequence cannot be attained, as a consequence of severe conformational perturbations induced in DNA by cisplatin adducts. The results also demonstrate an increase of the binding affinity of p53 to DNA lacking the consensus sequence and modified by cisplatin but not by transplatin. In addition, only major 1,2-GG intrastrand cross-links of cisplatin are responsible for this enhanced binding affinity of p53.

Cisplatin: Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug. Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta, Zurich1999: 31-72Google Scholar). The success of platinum complexes in killing tumor cells results from their ability to form on DNA various types of covalent adducts (3Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar). The first platinum complex introduced in the clinic is cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin)1 (1Wong E. Giandomenico C.M. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2451-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar, 4Rosenberg B. Lippert B. Cisplatin: Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug. Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta, Zurich1999: 3-30Google Scholar). Although the antitumor effects of cisplatin were discovered more than 30 years ago, the mechanism of its antitumor activity has not yet been fully understood. It has been shown (3Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar) that this bifunctional platinum complex forms on DNA mainly intrastrand cross-links (CLs) between neighboring purine residues (∼90%). Other minor adducts are intrastrand CLs between two purine nucleotides separated by one or more nucleotides and interstrand CLs; a few adducts remain monofunctional. Transplatin (trans isomer of cisplatin) is clinically ineffective; thus both isomers have been widely used in studies of the structure-pharmacological activity relationship of platinum complexes (5Brabec V. Kleinwächter V. Butour J.L. Johnson N.P. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 35: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In these studies, one searches for differences between active and inactive compounds that may be responsible for the differences in the pharmacological effect. Transplatin-DNA adducts are interstrand CLs, and a relatively large portion of adducts remains monofunctional (6Leng M. Schwartz A. Giraud-Panis M.J. Kelland L.R. Farrell N.P. Platinum-Based Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 63-85Google Scholar, 7Leng M. Locker D. Giraud-Panis M.J. Schwartz A. Intini F.P. Natile G. Pisano C. Boccarelli A. Giordano D. Coluccia M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The adducts formed on DNA by bifunctional platinum compounds are capable of terminating DNA synthesis (1Wong E. Giandomenico C.M. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2451-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar) and triggering several cellular processes such as apoptosis (8Eastman A. Lippert B. Cisplatin: Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug. Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta, Zurich1999: 111-134Google Scholar) or repair of lesions (9Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Lippert B.

Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). It has become clear that under some circumstances p53 can play a major role in the activation of apoptosis (11Burns T.F. El-Deiry W.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 12Bates S. Vousden K.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and actively participates in various processes of DNA repair via its ability to interact with components of the repair machinery and by its various biochemical activities (13Janus F. Albrechtsen N. Dornreiter I. Wiesmüller L. Grosse F. Deppert W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a nuclear phosphoprotein consisting of 393 amino acids and containing four major functional domains (14May P. May E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7621-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activation domain is located at the N terminus, whereas the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain is within the central part of p53. The C-terminal portion, which interacts with DNA in a nonspecific manner, contains an oligomerization and regulatory domains. p53 is a potent mediator of cellular responses against genotoxic insults (13Janus F. Albrechtsen N. Dornreiter I. Wiesmüller L. Grosse F. Deppert W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) that exerts its effect through transcriptional regulation. Upon exposure to genotoxic compounds, p53 protein levels increase due to several post-transcriptional mechanisms. Cisplatin induces apoptosis in cells expressing either wild-type (wt) or mutant p53 so that a consensus on the significance of p53 for response to cisplatin has not been attainable (15Zamble D.B. Tyler J. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6163-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, on average, cells with mutant p53 are more resistant to the effect of cisplatin (16O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Bae I. Myers T.G. Fan S. Mutoh M. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Sausville E.A. Weinstein J.N. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4285-4300PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, it seems reasonable to conclude that p53 can control the processing of DNA adducts of platinum, depending on the cell type. The tumor suppressor function of p53 protein is crucially related to its DNA binding activity. Active wt p53 binds as a tetramer to over 100 different response elements naturally occurring in the human genome. These response elements, which show functionality, differ in the details of their specific base sequence, but all contain two tandem consensus decamers, each a pentameric inverted repeat. Most consensus decamers, separated in the binding unit by 0–21 base pairs (bp), follow the consensus sequence pattern (17El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar) PuPuPuC(A/t)‖(T/a)GPyPyPy, where Pu and Py are purines and pyrimidines, respectively, and the vertical bar denotes the center of pseudodyad symmetry. Four molecules of the DNA-binding domain of p53 bind the response elements with high cooperativity. They also bend DNA. It has been suggested (18Nagaich A.K. Zhurkin V.B. Durell S.R. Jernigan R.L. Appella E. Harrington R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1875-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that this bending is localized mostly at the two pentamer CA‖TG junctions in the consensus DNA response element (CDRE) (by 25–28° at each junction) toward the major groove. Active wt p53 also over-twists the DNA response element by ∼70°. This DNA twisting is uniformly distributed among the pentamers. It has also been suggested that due to many functions of p53 protein the demands for binding specificity and selectivity are necessarily extraordinary, which is accomplished through its tetrameric association with a repetitive binding site. Precise steric fit accommodated through both DNA bending and twisting appears extremely important in this binding site. Because DNA bending and twisting are coupled in the p53-DNA complex, the binding specificity of the p53 system as well as complex stability could be fine-tuned by agents that affect DNA bending and twisting. It has been shown (3Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar) that DNA adducts of cisplatin and other platinum bifunctional compounds distort the conformation of DNA, including bending and changes in the twist angle. Thus, formation of the adducts by platinum compounds in the CDRE could affect its binding affinity to p53. No direct interaction between active wt p53 and platinum-modified DNA in cell-free media has yet been reported. Only binding of latent p53 protein, lacking sequence-specific DNA binding, to DNA modified by cisplatin has been reported (19Wetzel C.C. Berberich S.J. Oncology Res. 1998; 10: 151-161PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we have used gel mobility shift assay methodology to investigate the binding affinity of the active human wt p53 system to the CDRE modified by either antitumor cisplatin or its clinically inefficient trans isomer in a cell-free medium. We have also examined binding of DNA lacking CDRE and modified by cisplatin or transplatin to reveal affinity of active wt p53 to platinated DNA containing no consensus nucleotide sequence. Thus, these studies could provide insight into the relative cytotoxicities of these two isomers, thereby potentially aiding in the rational design of new platinum drugs as well as illuminating aspects of the role of p53 in chemotherapy by platinum compounds. For CDRE binding of the p53 protein we used a smallPvuII (474 bp) fragment of pPGM1 plasmid derived from pBluescript SK II+ DNA (2961 bp, Stratagene) by cloning the p53 20-bp CDRE 5′-AGACATGCCTAGACATGCCT-3′/5′-AGGCATGTCTAGGCATGTCT-3′ into the HindIII site. pPGM1 and pBluescript SK II+ DNAs were purified using Qiagen kits. Ethanol-precipitated plasmids were resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm Na3EDTA (pH 7.5)) and stored at 4 °C. The synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides (Fig. 1) were purchased from IDT, Inc. (Coralville, IA) and purified as described previously (20Brabec V. Reedijk J. Leng M.

The human wt p53 protein was expressed in baculovirus-infected recombinant Sf9 insect cells. The details of the purification were described previously (22Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18165-18174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. In the present paper the concentration of the p53 protein is related to tetrameric protein units. Cisplatin and transplatin were purchased from Sigma. Monodentate diethylenetriaminechloroplatinum(II) chloride ([Cl(dien)Pt]Cl) was kindly provided by Dr. G. Natile (University of Bari, Italy). ShortPvuII fragments of pPGM1 and pBluescript II SK+plasmid DNAs (474 and 448 bp, respectively) and an oligonucleotide duplex (oligo-CDRE) were incubated with cisplatin or transplatin in 10 mm NaClO4 at 37 °C for 48 h in the dark. The number of platinum atoms bound per nucleotide (rb value) was determined by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry or differential pulse polarography (23Kim S.D. Vrana O. Kleinwächter V. Niki K. Brabec V. Anal. Lett. 1990; 23: 1505-1518Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The number of interstrand CLs formed by cisplatin in the oligo-CDRE duplex was determined using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under denaturing conditions in the same way as described in previous reports (24Lemaire M.A. Schwartz A.

The oligonucleotide duplexes containing single site-specific adducts of cisplatin were prepared and characterized as described previously (20Brabec V. Reedijk J. Leng M.

Formation of the complexes of the p53 protein with the 474- or 448-bp-longPvuII fragments of pPGM1 or pBluescript SK II+, respectively, unplatinated or modified by cisplatin or transplatin was examined in a buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm Na3EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 0.01% Triton X-100 in a total volume of 15 μl. The nonmodified or platinated 474- or 448-bp fragment was mixed with a nonmodified 2513-bp-long fragment of pPGM1. The final amounts of the short and long fragments in the reactions were 150 and 850 ng, respectively (the molar ratio of these fragments was ∼1). The molar ratio of p53 to the 474- or 448-bp fragment was 0–6. Samples with p53 protein were incubated in ice for 30 min. After the incubation was completed, 3 μl of the loading buffer (50% glycerol, 50 mm Na3EDTA, 2% bromphenol blue) was added, and the samples were loaded on the 1% agarose gel precooled to 4 °C and electrophoresed in 0.5× TBE buffer (0.09 m Tris borate, 2 mmNa3EDTA (pH 8.0)). The gel was finally stained by ethidium bromide. Formation of the complexes of p53 with the oligonucleotide duplexes was examined in the same buffer as that used for analysis of the complexes of p53 with the plasmid fragments (see above) in a total volume of 12 μl. The nonmodified or platinated duplexes were mixed with the nonmodified 2513-bp-long fragment of pPGM1. The final amounts of the duplexes and long fragment in the reactions were 20 and 120 ng, respectively. The molar ratio of p53 to duplex was 0–3. Samples with p53 were incubated in ice for 30 min. After the incubation was completed, 3 μl of the loading buffer (50% glycerol, 50 mm Na3EDTA, 2% bromphenol blue) was added, and the samples were loaded on the native 5% polyacrylamide gel (mono:bis(acrylamide) ratio, 29:1) precooled to 4 °C in 0.5× TBE buffer. The radioactivity associated with the bands was quantified by means of a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Storm 860 system with ImageQuant software). The primary p53 monoclonal antibody (mAb) DO-1 (purified and characterized as described in Ref. 29Vojtesek B. Bartek J. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 151: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) was also added to the p53-DNA complex (the molar ratio of mAb to p53 tetramer was 3), the mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min at 20 °C, and the resulting p53-DNA-mAb complexes were loaded on the gels. T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP used for 5′-end radioactive labeling of the top strands of the oligonucleotide duplexes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively. Acrylamide, bis(acrylamide), agarose, and urea were from Merck KgaA (Darmstadt, Germany). pPGM1 plasmid was cleaved by PvuII (blunt end-forming enzyme, which cuts twice within the pPGM1). This cleavage produced 474- and 2513-bp fragments containing and lacking CDRE, respectively. The two fragments were separated on the agarose gel, extracted, and purified. The 474-bp fragment was further globally modified by cisplatin or transplatin at rb = 0.02–0.1, and the unplatinated 2513-bp fragment was added as the nonspecific competitor. This mixture was incubated with various amounts of wt p53 (at molar ratios of p53 to 474-bp fragment in the range of 0–6) and analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis. The incubation of the unplatinated 474-bp fragment with increasing amounts of p53 resulted in the appearance of a new, more slowly migrating species, with a concomitant decrease of the intensity of the band corresponding to the 474-bp fragment incubated in the absence of p53 (shown for p53:474-bp fragment ratio of 0.95 in Fig.2, lane 6). This result was in agreement with the previously published reports and demonstrated formation of a sequence-specific complex between DNA and p53 protein (30Mazur S.J. Sakaguchi K. Appella E.

Importantly, addition of DO-1 mAb (which maps to the N-terminal domain of p53) produced supershifted complexes that migrated still more slowly than the p53–474-bp complex (Fig. 2, lane 11), confirming the presence of p53 in the more slowly migrating species. In contrast, incubation of the 474-bp fragment modified by cisplatin atrb = 0.02–0.06 with p53 (in the presence of the unplatinated 2513-bp fragment) considerably reduced the yield of the species migrating more slowly in the agarose gel (shown for a p53 to 474-bp fragment ratio of 0.95 in Fig. 2, lanes 7–9). This result is consistent with the idea that cisplatin adducts efficiently reduce binding affinity of the CDRE to active p53. The same experiments were performed with the 474-bp fragment globally modified by transplatin. No reduction in the intensity of the band corresponding to the sequence-specific p53-DNA complex as a consequence of the modification by transplatin was noticed even at rbas high as 0.1 (shown for rb = 0.06 and a p53 to 474-bp fragment ratio of 0.95 in Fig. 2, lane 10). This result demonstrates the inefficiency of transplatin adducts to reduce the binding affinity of the CDRE to the active p53 protein. Further studies were performed using a short (20 bp) oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplex, oligo-CDRE (Fig. 1) whose sequence follows the consensus sequence pattern (17El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). The duplex was globally modified by cisplatin or transplatin to rb in the range of 0.02–0.06, and the unplatinated PvuII fragment of pPGM1, which was 2513 bp long and contained no CDRE, was added as the nonspecific competitor. These mixtures were incubated with p53 at various p53 to duplex molar ratios (0.1–3) and analyzed using native PAGE (Fig. 3). Incubation of the unplatinated oligo-CDRE with increasing amounts of p53 resulted in the appearance of the new, more slowly migrating species, with a concomitant decrease of the intensity of the band corresponding to the 20-bp duplex incubated in the absence of p53 (shown for a p53 to duplex ratio of 0.3 in Fig. 3, lane 2). This result confirmed the formation of the complex between oligo-CDRE and p53. In contrast, the incubation of oligo-CDRE modified by cisplatin at rb= 0.02–0.06 with p53 reduced the yield of the species migrating more slowly in the gel. For instance, the modification of oligo-CDRE by cisplatin at rb = 0.05 already completely inhibited formation of the complex between this duplex and p53 (shown for a p53 to duplex molar ratio of 0.3 in Fig. 3, lane 4). It was also verified using PAGE under denaturing conditions that the modification of oligo-CDRE by cisplatin at rb = 0.05 also afforded duplexes interstrand-cross-linked by this drug (data not shown). The quantitative evaluation (24Lemaire M.A. Schwartz A. Rahmouni A.R. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1982-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 25Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) of the radioactivities associated with the bands corresponding to interstrand cross-linked duplexes and duplexes containing no interstrand CL (24Lemaire M.A. Schwartz A. Rahmouni A.R. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1982-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 25Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) revealed ∼20% of duplexes containing at least one interstrand CL of cisplatin. Oligo-CDRE was also globally modified by transplatin and incubated with p53. No reduction of the intensity of the band corresponding to the p53-oligo-CDRE complex was noticed even at so high anrb as 0.05 (Fig. 3, lane 6),i.e. under conditions when cisplatin adducts inhibited formation of the complex between p53 and the duplex completely (Fig. 3,lane 4). Thus, these experiments confirmed that transplatin adducts do not affect the binding affinity of the CDRE to p53 protein. We also investigated binding of p53 to the 448-bp fragment of the pBluescript II SK+ plasmid lacking CDRE but modified by cisplatin or transplatin. The plasmid was cleaved by PvuII, which yielded the 448- and 2513-bp fragments. The longer fragment was identical to that produced by thePvuII cleavage of pPGM1, whereas the shorter fragment only differed from the shorter fragment produced by PvuII cleavage of pPGM1 by lacking CDRE. The 448-bp fragment was globally modified by cisplatin or transplatin at rb = 0.01–0.08. After the 448-bp fragment was platinated, the unplatinated 2513-bp fragment was added as the nonspecific competitor. These mixtures were incubated with p53 at various p53 to 448-bp fragment molar ratios (in the range of 0.5–6) and analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis. Incubation of the unplatinated PvuII fragments with increasing amounts of p53 resulted in no changes in the migration of these fragments, demonstrating no effect on formation of the complex between p53 and DNA lacking CDRE (shown for a p53 to 448-bp fragment ratio of 6 in Fig. 4, lane 6). On the other hand, a new species migrating in the gel considerably more slowly was observed if the 448-bp fragment modified by cisplatin at rb = 0.01–0.08 was analyzed (shown for a p53 to 448-bp fragment ratio of 6 in Fig. 4, lanes 7–9). This result demonstrated formation of the complex between p53 and DNA lacking CDRE and modified by cisplatin (30Mazur S.J. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Wang X.W. Harris C.C. Bohr V.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Importantly, supershifted complexes were noticed as a consequence of addition of mAb DO-1 to the complex of p53 with the 448-bp fragment modified by cisplatin (Fig. 4, lane 11). The same experiments were performed with the 448-bp fragment globally modified by clinically ineffective transplatin. No more slowly migrating species as a consequence of the modification by transplatin was noticed atrb = 0.08 and a p53 to DNA ratio of 6 (shown forrb = 0.08 and a p53 to 448-bp fragment ratio of 6 in Fig. 4, lane 10). Thus, these results indicate that the binding affinity of p53 to DNA lacking CDRE is enhanced selectively by the modification by cisplatin and not by transplatin. Cisplatin forms several types of adducts, which occur in DNA with a different frequency and differently distort the conformation of DNA (3Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar). To determine which specific adduct of cisplatin represents a structural motif responsible for recognition of cisplatin-modified DNA lacking CDRE by p53, we prepared a series of 20-bp duplexes with blunt ends. The nucleotide sequences of these oligonucleotides were designed (Fig. 1) so that they did not follow the consensus sequence pattern (17El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar), but they allowed us to prepare the duplexes containing a single site-specific adduct of cisplatin, such as 1,2-GG or 1,3-GTG intrastrand CL in d(TGGT)/d(ACCA) or d(TGTGT)/d(ACACA), respectively, and 1,2-GG interstrand CL or a site-specific monofunctional adduct of the model platinum compound [Cl(dien)Pt]Cl (20Brabec V. Reedijk J. Leng M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12397-12402Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) in the duplex d(TGCT)/d(AGCA). The duplexes containing the single adduct were prepared and purified, and the unplatinated PvuII fragment of pPGM1, which was 2513 bp long and lacked CDRE, was added as the nonspecific competitor. These mixtures were incubated with p53 at various p53 to duplex molar ratios (0.1–3) and analyzed using native PAGE. Incubation of the mixtures containing unplatinated oligonucleotide duplexes with p53 did not result in the appearance of any more slowly migrating species (shown for a p53 to duplex ratio of 3 in Fig. 5, lane 2). Similarly, no more slowly migrating species that would demonstrate formation of the complex between p53 and the platinated duplex was observed if p53 was incubated with the duplexes containing the single site-specific 1,3-GTG intrastrand, 1,2-GG interstrand CL of cisplatin, or monofunctional adduct of [Cl(dien)Pt]Cl (shown for a p53 to duplex ratio of 3 in Fig. 5, lanes 8, 10,12). In contrast, incubation of the d(TGGT)d(ACCA) duplex containing 1,2-GG intrastrand CL of cisplatin with p53 did result in the occurrence of the species migrating more slowly in the gel (shown for a p53 to duplex ratio of 0.93–3 in Fig. 5, lanes 4–6). These results demonstrate that among DNA adducts of cisplatin major intrastrand adducts between neighboring purine residues only produce a structural motif responsible for enhancement of the binding affinity of active p53 to cisplatin-modified DNA lacking CDRE. Interestingly, the protein concentration at which half of the free d(TGGT)/d(ACCA) duplex containing the single 1,2-intrastrand CL was bound, was ∼1.5 × 10−7m(Fig. 5, lane 5), whereas that at which half of the unplatinated oligo-CDRE was bound was roughly 10 times lower. This rough comparison shows that the binding affinity of p53 to 1,2-intrastrand cross-link of cisplatin formed in DNA lacking CDRE is lower than the binding affinity of p53 to unplatinated CDRE. It has been shown that sequence-dependent conformational variability of response elements plays a critical role in the sequence-specific binding of p53 to DNA and the stability of the resulting complex. Extraordinary demands for this binding specificity and selectivity of p53 are closely related to its tetrameric association with CDRE, in which a precise steric fit is extremely important. It has been suggested (18Nagaich A.K. Zhurkin V.B. Durell S.R. Jernigan R.L. Appella E. Harrington R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1875-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that steric fit is accommodated through strongly correlated DNA bending localized at the two highly bendable CA‖TG junctions and twisting uniformly distributed between the pentamers of the CDRE. The consensus sequences investigated in the present work contained several sites at which bifunctional adducts of cisplatin strongly distorting DNA conformation are formed. In particular, they contained the sites at which major intrastrand CLs between adjacent purines (at d(GG) or 5′-d(AG)) are formed. For instance, the structure of these adducts determined by NMR methods has revealed (31Yang D.Z. van Boom S.S.G.E. Reedijk J. van Boom J.H. Wang A.H.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12912-12920Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 32Gelasco A. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9230-9239Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) that these adducts induce the overall helix bend of 40–78° toward the major groove, DNA unwinding of 25–27°, severe perturbation of hydrogen bonding within the 5′-coordinated GC bp, and distortion extended over at least 4–5 bp at the site of the CL. Interestingly, the CDREs tested in the present work also contain the sites at which cisplatin forms less frequent interstrand CLs. Formation of these lesions in the CDREs investigated in the present work was confirmed by PAGE under denaturing conditions (see above). The interstrand CL, which is preferentially formed by cisplatin between opposite G residues in the 5′-GC/5′-GC sequence (24Lemaire M.A. Schwartz A. Rahmouni A.R. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1982-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), induces several irregularities in the cross-linked base pairs and their immediately adjacent pairs (33Brabec V. Kelland L.R. Farrell N.P. Platinum-Based Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 37-61Google Scholar). The cross-linked G residues are not paired with hydrogen bonds to the complementary cytosines, which are located outside the duplex and not stacked with other aromatic rings. All other base residues are paired, but distortion extends over at least 4 bp at the site of the CL. In addition, thecis-diammineplatinum(II) bridge resides in the minor groove, and the double helix is locally reversed to a left-handed, Z-DNA-like form. This adduct induces the helix unwinding by ∼80° relative to B-DNA and also the bending of ∼40° of the helix axis at the cross-linked site toward the minor groove. Thus, cisplatin formed in the CDREs investigated in the present work bifunctional adducts, which strongly disturb its secondary structure. The result of these perturbations is that the precise steric fit required for the formation and stability of the tetrameric complex of p53 with the consensus nucleotide sequence cannot be attained, so that p53 does not bind to its CDRE. We demonstrated in the present work that 1,2-intrastrand CLs of cisplatin formed in the CDRE reduce its binding affinity to p53, whereas the same adducts formed in the sequences that do not follow the CDRE pattern afford DNA enhanced binding affinity to p53. Hence, the CDRE should have some intrinsic specific feature absent in the usual B-DNA that precludes p53 from binding to CDRE after its modification by cisplatin. It has been shown (18Nagaich A.K. Zhurkin V.B. Durell S.R. Jernigan R.L. Appella E. Harrington R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1875-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that CDREs are already intrinsically curved in the flexible CATG tetramers, with the directionality close to that in the p53-DNA complexes. We suggest that unique alterations induced in the consensus sequence simultaneously by 1,2-intrastrand CLs of cisplatin and the intrinsic curvature of the CDRE are structural factors responsible for the reduced affinity of p53 to its consensus sequence modified by cisplatin. Clinically ineffective transplatin also forms various types of adducts in DNA. It forms mainly monofunctional adducts at G residues and some amount of interstrand CLs between complementary G and C residues (6Leng M. Schwartz A. Giraud-Panis M.J. Kelland L.R. Farrell N.P. Platinum-Based Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 63-85Google Scholar, 7Leng M. Locker D. Giraud-Panis M.J. Schwartz A. Intini F.P. Natile G. Pisano C. Boccarelli A. Giordano D. Coluccia M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,25Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Monofunctional adducts of transplatin (and cisplatin) affect DNA conformation only slightly, without bending (20Brabec V. Reedijk J. Leng M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12397-12402Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and DNA unwinding is very small (∼6°) (34Keck M.V. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3386-3390Crossref Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In addition, the conformational alterations induced by the interstrand CL of transplatin are much less severe than those induced by the CLs of cisplatin (33Brabec V. Kelland L.R. Farrell N.P. Platinum-Based Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 37-61Google Scholar, 35Brabec V. Sip M. Leng M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11676-11681Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The duplex is slightly distorted on both sides of the CL, but all bases are still paired and hydrogen-bonded. The CL of transplatin only unwinds the double helix by ∼12° and induces a slight, flexible bending of ∼20° of its axis toward the minor groove. We conclude that these relatively subtle structural perturbations induced by transplatin in the CDRE have no substantial effect on the formation of the tetrameric complex of p53 with the CDRE. The results of the present work also demonstrate enhancement of the binding affinity of p53 to DNA lacking CDRE due to its modification by cisplatin. However, this binding affinity of p53 is considerably lower (roughly by one order of magnitude) than that to the unplatinated CDRE. Importantly, no change of the binding affinity to p53 of DNA lacking CDRE is observed due to its modification by clinically ineffective transplatin; thus this enhancement is specific for cisplatin-modified DNA. Also importantly, among DNA adducts of cisplatin only the 1,2-intrastrand CLs are responsible for this increase in DNA binding to p53. Hence, 1,2-intrastrand CLs distort DNA lacking the CDRE in a specific way, producing a structural motif recognized by p53. We propose that directional and stable bending of DNA lacking the CDRE toward its major groove due to formation of the 1,2-intrastrand CL of cisplatin affords a structural element exhibiting this specific affinity to p53. In this way a stable flexure of DNA by 1,2-intrastrand CL provides an opportunity for more stable contacts between p53 and DNA lacking CDRE. In other words, the lesions such as 1,2-intrastrand CLs that efficiently induce the directional and fixed bend in DNA toward the major groove, thus providing a stable pre-bent site on DNA to p53, serve as a structural motif for recognition of DNA lacking CDRE by p53. The observation that other minor bifunctional DNA adducts formed by cisplatin in usual B-DNA lacking CDRE, which also bend and unwind DNA, are not recognized by p53 deserves further discussion. The intrastrand CL formed by cisplatin between two G residues separated by a third base also bends the helix axis toward the major groove by ∼30° (36Teuben J.M. Bauer C. Wang A.H.J. Reedijk J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12305-12312Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and locally unwinds DNA by ∼19° (26Bellon S.F. Coleman J.H. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8026-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, another important feature of the conformational alteration induced by this lesion is that DNA is locally denatured and flexible at the site of the adduct (36Teuben J.M. Bauer C. Wang A.H.J. Reedijk J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12305-12312Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the structural feature much less pronounced in the 1,2-intrastrand adduct. Furthermore, interstrand CLs of cisplatin also distort DNA distinctly differently and more severely than intrastrand adducts (see above). These significant structural differences between the latter minor adducts and the major 1,2-intrastrand CLs suggest that their recognition and binding by active p53 will be different and restricted to the structural features identical or similar to those induced in DNA by the 1,2-intrastrand adduct of cisplatin. Consistent with this idea is the observation that there are also significant structural differences between 1,2-intrastrand CLs of cisplatin and the adducts formed on DNA by transplatin (see above), which do not form the lesions recognized by p53 on DNA lacking CDREs. Thus, the data base on the structures of cisplatin and transplatin adducts reveals their propensity to distort DNA in very different ways. The distinctive structural features of 1,2-intrastrand CLs of cisplatin suggest a unique role for this adduct in the enhancement of the binding of p53 to platinated DNA segments lacking CDRE, which is, however, weaker than the binding of p53 to unplatinated CDRE. There is substantial evidence suggesting that p53 plays a central role in the cellular response to DNA damage. It is also clear that p53 function may only be one of many factors that modulate cisplatin sensitivity, and the effects may be different for various cell types. In addition, sequence-specific DNA binding is one of the key biochemical activities responsible for much of the biological function of p53. Hence, the observation described in the present work demonstrating that cisplatin adducts formed in the CDRE reduce its binding affinity to active p53 may affect these key biochemical activities. Because the affinity of p53 to the CDRE is not affected by the adducts of clinically ineffective transplatin, we suggest that the reduced affinity of the active p53 protein to the CDRE due to its modification by cisplatin is relevant to the biological activity of this drug. A possible intriguing scenario for response to cellular exposure to cisplatin is also that associated with another important result of the present work demonstrating a relatively weak but significant increase in the binding affinity of p53 to major adducts of cisplatin-1,2-intrastrand CLs formed in the parts of DNA lacking CDRE. This increase in the binding affinity of p53 is specific for DNA modified by cisplatin and does not occur if DNA is modified by clinically ineffective transplatin. This result is consistent with the view that the mechanism of antitumor activity of cisplatin may also be associated with its efficiency to promote binding activity of p53 in the segments of DNA lacking CDRE. We suggest that 1,2-intrastrand CLs formed by cisplatin in DNA segments lacking CDRE may be sufficient to hijack p53 protein, keeping it away from its natural targets. Thus, the resultant complexes may divert p53 from its natural functions and/or may protect the cisplatin damage from its recognition by other cellular components. Alternatively, it has been shown (37Imamura T. Izumi H. Nagatani G. Ise T. Nomoto M. Iwamoto Y. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7534-7540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) that p53 enhances binding of DNA modified by cisplatin to chromosomal high mobility group (HMG) 1 protein. HMG domain proteins are known to specifically bind 1,2-intrastrand CLs of cisplatin and thus mediate antitumor effects of this drug (3Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar). The details of how the binding of HMG domain proteins to cisplatin-modified DNA sensitizes tumor cells to cisplatin are still not completely resolved, but possibilities such as shielding cisplatin-DNA adducts from excision repair or titrating away these proteins from their transcriptional regulatory function have been suggested as clues to how these proteins are involved in the antitumor activity (9Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Lippert B. Cisplatin: Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug. Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta, Zurich1999: 73-110Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that p53 and HMG1 proteins encounter each other at the sites of 1,2-intrastrand adducts of cisplatin (formed outside the CDRE). This interaction could further promote keeping p53 away from its natural target and/or promote the binding affinity of HMG1 protein to cisplatin-modified DNA, with the consequences for the antitumor effect of cisplatin mentioned above. More detailed information about cellular consequences of interactions of platinated DNA and p53 protein is required before any definite conclusions can be drawn about how these interactions contribute to the mechanism of the biological activity of cisplatin.

Simon O. Borriss R. Heinemann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5287-5291Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 8Heinemann U. Hahn M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 349-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The bacterial enzymes are, in general, more thermotolerant than their barley counterparts. With respect to the kinetic properties of bacterial 1,3–1,4-β-d-glucanases, these enzymes reside with the retaining glycosidase activity leading to the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds with a net retention of the anomeric configuration during β-glucan hydrolysis (9Malet C. Jiménez-Barbero J. Bernabé M. Brosa C. Planas A. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The 1,3–1,4-β-d-glucanase enzyme has been proposed to follow a general acid-base catalytic mechanism in which specific amino acid residues acting as a general acid or a nucleophile are required for completing a catalytic reaction of the enzyme (10Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). A number of methodologies have been previously applied to the characterization of catalytic mechanism(s) ofBacillus 1,3–1,4-β-d-glucanases, including site-directed mutagenesis, affinity labeling, and x-ray crystallography analysis. The Glu134 and Glu138 amino acid residues within the Bacillus licheniformis enzyme have been identified as the nucleophile and the catalytic acid/base, respectively (11Juncosa M. Pons J. Dot T. Querol E. Planas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14530-14535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Viladot J.-L. Ramon E. Durany O. Planas A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11332-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The Glu105 and Glu109 residues ofBacillus macerans and H(A16-M)1,3–1,4-β-d-glucanases have also been shown to confer a catalytic function similar to that observed for Glu134 and Glu138 of the B. licheniformis enzyme (4Keitel T.

A key ruminal bacterial enzyme producer, Fibrobacter succinogenes, plays a major role in plant fiber degradation in the rumen of major livestock species. Several of the enzymes related to the degradation of cellulose or hemicellulose polymers of plant cell walls from this organism have been isolated and partially characterized (14Stewart C.S. Flint H.J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1989; 30: 433-439Google Scholar). A F. succinogenes 1,3–1,4-β-d-glucanase was isolated and investigated by Erfle and co-workers (15Erfle J.D. Wood P.J. Irvin J.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Teather R.M. Erfle J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3837-3841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme consists of a protein sequence with a circular permutation in which two highly conserved catalytic domains (namely A and B) of the enzyme are in a reverse orientation as compared with that of other 1,3–1,4-β-d-glucanases (6Schimming S. Schwarz W.H. Staudenbauer W.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Heinemann U. Hahn M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 349-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16Teather R.M. Erfle J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3837-3841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 5 times repeated segment, PXSSSS, was only observed in the C-terminal, nonhomologous region of the amino acid sequence of theFibrobacter enzyme relative to the bacilli or other bacterial and fungal 1,3–1,4-β-d-glucanases. Nevertheless, alignment of the amino acid sequences of the F. succinogenes enzyme with other 1,3–1,4-β-d-glucanases suggests that a number of amino acid residues in the highly conserved region may play important roles in catalysis of the enzyme (see Fig. 1). In an attempt to identify the possible involvement of specific amino acid residues in the catalytic activity of F. succinogenes1,3–1,4-β-d-glucanase, we evaluated the potential functional significance of the Met39, Glu56, Asp58, Glu60, and Gly63 residues of the enzyme, using a combination of various approaches including site-directed mutagenesis, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectrometry, kinetics, and structural modeling. Several lines of evidence were obtained, providing some useful information about the structural and functional relationship of F. succinogenes 1,3–1,4-β-d-glucanase. The most significant findings of this investigation are: 1) substitutions of Glu56, Asp58, and Glu60 with either alanine or glutamine can completely abolish enzymatic activity; 2) replacement of Gly63 with alanine can greatly reduce thermostability of the enzyme; and 3) Met39 is essential for the 1,3–1,4-β-d-glucanase of F. succinogenes to maintain the most effective catalytic efficiency for the enzyme. This study provides new information that may be used to improve this ruminal enzyme for industrial utilization as a feed or food-processing aid, using either rational design or DNA shuffling approaches. The full-length cDNA of F. succinogenes1,3–1,4-β-d-glucanase (Fsβ-glucanase)1 in a pIJ10 plasmid was amplified and introduced with NcoI andEcoRI restriction enzyme recognition sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, by using a PCR-based method. The two primers designed for the NcoI and EcoRI sites were 5′-TCACCACCATGGTTAGCGCAAAG-3′ and 5′-GCCACGAATTCTGTTCAAAGTTCAC-3′, respectively. The PCR reaction was performed with a thermocycling program as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 1 cycle; 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles; and 94 °C for 1.5 min, 55 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 10 min for 1 cycle. The resulting amplified DNA fragments were digested with NcoI and EcoRI, purified, and ligated onto the pET26b(+) vector, which was predigested withNcoI and EcoRI. The recombinant gene sequence for Fsβ-glucanase, designated “pFsNcE,” was confirmed by DNA sequencing using the chain termination method (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52770) Google Scholar). In this DNA construct, a pelB leading peptide at the N terminus plus 19 extra amino acid residues including a His6 tag at the C terminus to facilitate protein purification were included. The recombinant plasmid encoding for the wild type enzyme was then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) host. Plasmid pFsNcE was used as the template for a PCR-based mutation (18Nelson M. McClelland M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 279-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) of Fsβ-glucanase. For this purpose, a pair of complementary mutagenic primers was designed for the mutation of each desired amino acid residue. Eleven pairs of mutagenic primers, as shown in Table I, were used to mutate Met39 → Phe, Glu56 → Ala, Glu56 → Asp, Glu56 → Gln, Asp58→ Ala, Asp58 → Glu, Asp58 → Asn, Glu60 → Ala, Glu60 → Asp, Glu60→ Gln, and Gly63 → Ala. The mutagenic PCR reaction mixture consisted of 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin, 10 ng of template DNA, 0.5 mm dNTPs, 0.5 μm each of the complementary primers, and 2.5 units of cloned Turbo Pfu DNA polymerase.Table IOligonucleotide primers for site-directed mutagenesisMutantsMutagenic primer sequencesM39F5′-CCATTCTGGTAGAGGAAGAAGGAACTGACTGTTCC-3′E56A5′-GGAAGGCCCTGGGTAGCAGTGGATATTGAAGTTC-3′E56D5′-GGAAGGCCCTGGGTAGACGTGGATATTGAAGTTC-3′E56Q5′-GGAAGGCCCTGGGTACAGGTGGATATTGAAGTTC-3′D58A5′-CCCTGGGTAGAAGTGGCTATTGAAGTTCTCGGC-3′D58E5′-CCCTGGGTAGAAGTGGAAATTGAAGTTCTCGGC-3′D58N5′-CCCTGGGTAGAAGTGAACATTGAAGTTCTCGGC-3′E60A5′-GGTAGAAGTGGATATTGCAGTTCTCGGCAAGAATCC-3′E60D5′-GGTAGAAGTGGATATTGACGTTCTCGGCAAGAATCC-3′E60Q5′-GGTAGAAGTGGATATTCAGGTTCTCGGCAAGAATCC-3′G63A5′-GTGGATATTGAAGTTCTCGCTAAGAATCCGGGCAG-3′ Open table in a new tab Mutant DNA was generated with a thermocycling program of 2 min at 95 °C and 16 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 60 s at 55 °C, and 12 min at 68 °C on a Hybaid TouchDown thermal cycler. The PCR-generated products were digested with 10 units of DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h, prior to their use for transformation into XL-1 Blue cells. Mutations were confirmed by fluorescent dideoxy chain termination DNA sequencing using T7 promoter and T7 terminator primers. The mutagenesis plasmid was then transformed into BL21(DE3) host cells for the overexpression of mutant enzyme. Optimal protein production conditions and cellular localization of Fsβ-glucanase in E. coli cells were investigated. 5 ml of pregrown culture of the BL21(DE3) bacterial strain carrying pET26b(+) containing the Fsβ-glucanase gene was added to 500 ml of fresh LB broth containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. The culture was shaken vigorously at 33 °C until theA600 nm reached 0.4–0.6. Addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to the culture then was performed, and the culture was further incubated for 12–24 h at 33 °C. Small amounts of culture aliquots were collected with a constant time interval after the IPTG induction. The culture medium and cell extract prepared from the collected cell pellet at different time periods of IPTG induction were then employed for enzymatic activity assay, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) according to Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and zymogram analysis. The wild type or mutant forms of Fsβ-glucanase produced in the above-described procedure were further purified. Approximately 80–85% of the total Fsβ-glucanase expressed in E. coli host cells was secreted into the culture medium. The extracellular secreted enzyme was collected by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and concentrated 10 times by volume using a Pellicon Cassette concentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with a 10,000Mr cut-off membrane. The concentrated supernatant was then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8 (buffer A), and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. 1,3–1,4-β-d-Glucanase proteins, either wild type or mutants, were collected from eluants of the column using a 0–1m NaCl salt gradient in buffer A. A second nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole buffer (buffer B) was then employed for further purification of the enzymes. From a 10–300 mmimidazole gradient eluant, a homogeneous enzyme preparation was obtained, as verified by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was quantified as described by Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. A zymogram was used to measure the enzymatic activity of the wild type and mutant forms of Fsβ-glucanase, which was performed essentially according to a reported method (21Piruzian E.S. Monzavi-Karbassi B. Darbinian N.S. Goldenkova I.V. Kobets N.S. Mochulsky A.V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. A 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing lichenan (1 mg/ml) and protein samples in sample buffer (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) pretreated at 90 °C for 10 min was prepared for zymogram analysis. After electrophoresis, the gel was rinsed twice with 20% isopropyl alcohol in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 20 min to remove SDS, and then equilibrated in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer for 20 min. Before staining with Congo red solution (0.5 mg/ml), the gel was preincubated at 40 °C for 10 min. The protein bands with 1,3–1,4-β-d-glucanase activity were then visualized using the Congo red staining. Protein samples for N-terminal sequence determination were resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by electrophoretic transfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, using a Mini-Trans-Blot cell system (Bio-Rad). Transferred protein bands on the membrane were visualized using the 0.1% Amido Black staining and then excised with a clean sharp razor blade. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was carried out on an Applied Biosystems model 492 gas phase sequencer equipped with an automated on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. The enzymatic activity of 1,3–1,4-β-d-glucanase was measured by determining the rate of reducing sugar production from the hydrolysis of substrate (lichenan). The reducing sugar was measured and quantified by the method of Miller (22Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (22579) Google Scholar) with glucose as the standard. A standard enzyme activity assay was performed in a 0.3-ml reaction mixture containing 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and 2.7–8 mg/ml lichenan by starting the reaction with the enzyme addition. After incubation at 40 °C for 10 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of a salicylic acid solution (22Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (22579) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required for releasing 1 μmol of reducing sugar (glucose equivalent). The specific activity is expressed as μmol of glucose/min/mg of protein. Various amounts of the purified enzymes (0.24–82.7 μg/ml) were used in each kinetic assay reaction, depending on the enzymatic activity of the enzyme. Kinetic data were analyzed using the computer program ENZFITTER (Biosoft) and using enzyme kinetics. CD studies on the wild type and mutant forms of F. succinogenes glucanase were carried out in a Jasco J715 CD spectrometer and a 1-mm cell at 25 °C. Spectra were collected from 200 to 260 nm in 1.3-nm increments, and each spectrum was blank collected and smoothed by using the software package provided with the instrument. The fluorescence emission spectra of the wild type and mutant forms of F. succinogenes1,3–1,4-β-d-glucanase were taken on an Amico-Bowman series 2 spectrometer (Spectronic Instruments, Inc.) at 25 °C with 1 × 1-cm cuvette. Excitation spectra were taken at 282 nm, and emission spectra were recorded at 302–440 nm, with a 4-nm slit for both spectra. Protein samples were treated with 4–8 m urea or without any pretreatment (native form) in 50 mmphosphate pH 7.0 buffer before the spectra were recorded. The urea-denatured samples were followed with a renaturation procedure by dialysis against 50 mm phosphate pH 7.0 buffer at 4 °C for 24 h, and the fluorescence emission spectra of the protein samples were then taken at the same parameters. The protein concentration for the wild type and mutant forms of the enzyme was 30 μg/ml for each measurement. The conditions for expression of Fsβ-glucanase in engineered E. coli cells were optimized in this study. The wild type and mutant forms of the enzyme were effectively expressed and secreted into the LB medium as a soluble protein when host cells were grown at 33 °C with IPTG induction. Production of the enzyme in the whole E. coli culture was detected 2 h after IPTG induction and reached a plateau of maximum activity 8–16 h postinduction (data not shown). It was also found that enzymatic activity was detected primarily in the cell-associated fraction (cytosolic form) during the early stage (2–8 h) of induction, and upon prolonged IPTG induction for up to 16 h, enzymatic activity was mostly detected in the conditioned culture medium (extracellular form). The pelB leader sequence in the plasmid DNA construct was apparently fully functioning and facilitated the effective secretion of Fsβ-glucanase into the culture medium. Approximately 60% of the extracellular secretion form of the proteins was found as Fsβ-glucanase after IPTG induction for 16–20 h, as determined using SDS-PAGE and zymogram analyses (data not shown). The results from SDS-PAGE and zymogram analyses are also in good agreement with data from enzymatic activity assays (data not shown), suggesting that the E. coli expressed enzyme can be collected as either a cytosolic or an extracellular form from the host bacterial culture. Homogeneous preparations of various recombinant enzymes were obtained by fractionation with a Q-Sepharose cation exchange column and followed by a separation with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The first 25-amino acid sequence at the N terminus of the purified Fsβ-glucanase was determined to be MVSAKDFSGAELYTLEEVQYGKFEA, which represents a matured form of the Fsβ-glucanase enzyme without the presence of a pelB leader peptide at the N terminus. The wild type enzyme has a molecular mass of 37,669 Da, as determined by mass spectrometry. The estimated isoelectric point of the recombinant enzyme is pH 6.7, as analyzed by a Genetics Computer Group, Inc. (Madison, WI) computer program. The three-dimensional structure of this enzyme, to our knowledge, has not been solved so far. Therefore, for the current study the target amino acid residues for mutation were chosen based on the evaluation and comparison of the amino acid sequence of the 1,3–1,4-β-d-glucanases isolated from different organisms and on the prediction of their possible roles in catalysis. Fig.1 shows that several of the amino acid residues of Fsβ-glucanase, including Glu56, Asp58, Glu60, and Gly63, are all conserved in the compared amino acid sequences. Methionine 39 is the only nonconservative amino acid residue observed in Fsβ-glucanase; in other words, the equivalent residues to position 39 of Fsβ-glucanase among other compared bacterial or fungal enzymes are all hydrophobic residues, including phenylalanine, isoleucine, and leucine. The expression conditions and purification protocol for the 11 mutant enzymes, namely M39F, E56A, E56D, E56Q, D58A, D58E, D58N, E60A, E60D, E60Q, and G63A, were similar to that of the wild type enzyme. Purity of the wild type and mutant enzymes was evaluated by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2). The wild type and the 11 mutant enzymes exhibited identical mobility and are present as greater than 96% homogeneity when using electrophoresis as a criterion. Zymogram analysis revealed that the mutant enzymes showed a similar or reduced level of enzymatic activity as compared with the wild type enzyme (data not shown). Similar protein expression profiles and yield levels were obtained from the culture supernatants collected for the wild type and the 11 mutant forms of Fsβ-glucanase, as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis, and protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. The emission fluorescence spectra of the native, urea-denatured, and denatured-renatured wild type and mutant forms of Fsβ-glucanase were analyzed. Fig. 3 shows the superimposed emission spectra of both native wild type and G63A enzymes, with a maximum emission peaked at 336 nm. The emission spectra of 8m urea-denatured wild type and mutant enzymes were bathochromic (red) shift and also superimposed with a maximum emission at 350 nm and a slight shoulder peak at 376 nm (Fig. 3). Fluorescence spectra similar to those of the native enzyme were also observed for the wild type and mutant enzymes pretreated with 8 m urea and followed with a renaturation protocol (via dialysis against phosphate buffer for 24 h). In this case, the maximum emission spectra for the wild type and G63A proteins have been found to shift back to 336 nm, and the spectra were very similar to those of native enzymes. These phenomena on emission fluorescence spectra of native, denatured, and denatured-renaturated forms of the protein for the wild type and G63A enzymes were also obtained for the E56Q mutant, which is an enzymatically inactive Fsβ-glucanase. CD spectrometry was employed for analyzing the performance of the native and urea-denatured then renatured wild type or mutant enzymes. All of the tested native forms of the wild type and the 11 mutant enzymes were shown to exhibit a maximum CD absorbance at 225 nm (data not shown). The renatured forms of the wild type, E56Q, and G63A glucanases showed CD spectra between 200 and 260 nm similar to their correspondent native forms of the proteins (data not shown). These results suggest that the single amino acid substitution of wild type Fsβ-glucanase in this study did not cause a global conformational change or aberrant folding of the enzyme. Folded structures were observed for the individual mutant enzymes as evidenced by analysis of the fluorescent and CD spectra, relative to those of the wild type enzyme. Therefore, the observed differences in the kinetic properties between the mutant and wild type forms of the Fsβ-glucanase enzyme apparently are not due to the disruption of the structural integrity of the enzyme. Enzymatic activity assays were further carried out for the native and renatured form of the wild type and mutant enzymes. After renaturation, the wild type and mutant enzymes showed a recovery of ∼85% activity relative to their original native forms of the enzyme. The results from the fluorescence, CD, and activity assays suggest that a great majority of the denatured Fsβ-glucanases, either as wild type or mutants, was able to effectively reassociate to their correspondent native forms of the protein. This study hence concludes that a reversible denaturation capability was observed for Fsβ-glucanase after the treatment with a high concentration of urea. Experiments on kinetic studies were mainly performed by using lichenan as the substrate in standard enzyme assays, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The specific activity of the recombinant, wild type Fsβ-glucanase expressed in E. coli cells is 1388 ± 82 units/mg, estimated with lichenan at 40 °C in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. This value is slightly higher than that (960 units/mg) reported for the native enzyme (15Erfle J.D. Wood P.J. Irvin J.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The affinity for lichenan (Km), the turnover number (kcat), and the catalysis efficiency (kcat/Km) of the wild type enzyme were 1.91 mg/ml, 871 s−1, and 456 s−1 (mg/ml)−1, respectively. In an attempt to evaluate the effect of specific amino acid substitutions on enzyme activity or other functions, the kinetic properties of the mutant enzymes were characterized. A dramatic change in the turnover rate was found for the mutations on amino acid residues Glu56, Asp58, and Glu60. For the E56A, E56Q, D58A, E60A, and E60Q mutants, we showed that no enzymatic activity was detectable for these variant protein forms. 2.5-, 241-, 570-, 880-, 540-, and 2.8-fold decreases in kcatwere observed for M39F, E56D, D58N, D58E, E60D, and G63A, respectively, relative to the kcat value of the wild type enzyme. These results suggest that amino acid residues Glu56, Asp58, and Glu60 may play an important role(s) for enzymatic activity and may be directly involved in the catalysis of Fsβ-glucanase. Small changes inKm values for lichenan were observed for the E56D, D58E, D58N, E60D, and G63A mutant enzymes; however, a 5.3-fold higherKm for lichenan was found for M39F as compared with the wild type enzyme. Comparison of the specificity constants,kcat/Km, is shown in TableII. The specificity constants decreased 4.5- and 14-fold in G63A and M39F, respectively. However, more significant changes (∼210–970-fold decrease) were observed in the single mutations of Glu56, Asp58, and Glu60, relative to the wild type enzyme. These results indicate that the three acidic amino acid residues in Fsβ-glucanase may play important roles in the catalysis of the enzyme. We have also examined the substrate specificity of the wild type and mutant forms of Fsβ-glucanase, by using lichenan, barley β-glucan, larminarine, carboxymethyl cellulose, and xylan as test substrates in enzymatic activity assays. No detectable binding affinity was observed for the wild type or mutant Fsβ-glucanase enzymes when larminarine, carboxymethyl cellulose, or xylan was used as the substrate.Table IIKinetic properties of wild type and mutant forms of F. succinogenes 1,3–1,4-β-d-glucanaseEnzymeSpecific activitykcatKm, lichenankcat/Kmunits/mgs−1mg/mls−1(mg/ml)−1Wild type1388 ± 828711.91 ± 0.01456M39F545 ± 3334210.3 ± 0.0533.2E56AND 2-aND, not detected.NDNDNDE56D5.75 ± 0.243.611.69 ± 0.092.14E56QNDNDNDNDD58ANDNDNDNDD58E1.57 ± 0.110.992.10 ± 0.060.47D58N2.43 ± 0.131.530.98 ± 0.061.56E60ANDNDNDNDE60D2.57 ± 0.171.611.04 ± 0.081.55E60QNDNDNDNDG63A502 ± 423153.10 ± 0.01101a ND, not detected."
https://openalex.org/W2003046867,"Chorismate synthase, the last enzyme in the shikimate pathway, catalyzes the transformation of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate to chorismate, a biochemically unique reaction in that it requires reduced FMN as a cofactor. Here we report on the cloning, expression, and characterization of the protein for the first time from an extremophilic organism Thermotoga maritima which is also one of the oldest and most slowly evolving eubacteria. The protein is monofunctional in that it does not have an intrinsic ability to reduce the FMN cofactor and thereby reflecting the nature of the ancestral enzyme. Circular dichroism studies indicate that the melting temperature of the T. maritima protein is above 92 °C compared with 54 °C for the homologousEscherichia coli protein while analytical ultracentrifugation showed that both proteins have the same quaternary structure. Interestingly, UV-visible spectral studies revealed that the dissociation constants for both oxidized FMN and 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate decrease 46- and 10-fold, respectively, upon heat treatment of the T. maritima protein. The heat treatment also results in the trapping of the flavin cofactor in an apolar environment, a feature which is enhanced by the presence of the substrate 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate. Nevertheless, stopped-flow spectrophotometric evidence suggests that the mechanism of the T. maritima protein is similar to that of the E. coli protein.

In essence, the study shows that T. maritima chorismate synthase exhibits considerably higher rigidity and thermostability while it has conserved features relevant to its catalytic function. 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Chorismate synthase catalyzes the final step in the shikimate pathway, which links the metabolism of carbohydrates to the biosynthesis of the three aromatic amino acids and many aromatic secondary metabolites in a series of seven enzymatic steps. The pathway is absent from mammals making it a prime target for the development of antimicrobial and herbicidal agents. Chorismate synthase itself is biochemically unique in nature in that it catalyzes a 1,4-anti-elimination of the 3-phosphate group and the 6 (pro-R)-hydrogen from 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate (EPSP)1 to yield chorismate (1Hill R.K. Newkome G.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1969; 91: 5893-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 2Onderka D.K. Floss H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1969; 91: 5894-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There is no other example of this type of catalysis known in nature, thereby making it exclusive. The enzyme has an absolute requirement for reduced FMN (3Morell H. Clark M.J. Knowles P.F. Sprinson D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 82-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Welch G.R. Cole K.W. Gaertner F.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and can be classified with regard to how it acquires this essential cofactor. The chorismate synthases for which the reduced flavin has to be supplied exogenously are referred to as monofunctional, e.g. those from Escherichia coli and plants (3Morell H. Clark M.J. Knowles P.F.

Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 1271-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), while chorismate synthases which possess the intrinsic ability to reduce the flavin at the expense of NADPH are referred to as being bifunctional, e.g. theNeurospora crassa enzyme (4Welch G.R. Cole K.W. Gaertner F.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10Gaertner F.H. Cole K.W. J. Biol.

From an evolutionary point of view, while it has been concluded from a phylogenetic analysis that all chorismate synthases are of monophyletic origin, it is not clear if the ancestral chorismate synthase was mono- or bifunctional (12Macheroux P. Schmid J. Amrhein N. Schaller A. Planta. 1999; 207: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the ancestral enzyme harbored the intrinsic flavin reductase activity (i.e. was bifunctional) as it is hard to imagine how this activity could have evolved in a framework of what are known to be monofunctional enzymes,i.e. the bacterial and plant chorismate synthases (12Macheroux P. Schmid J. Amrhein N. Schaller A. Planta. 1999; 207: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In any case, as reduction of the FMN cofactor could be envisioned as a possible regulatory effector of chorismate synthase it would be intriguing to establish the history of how the enzyme has maintained reduction of the cofactor. Recently, the genome of the hyperthermophilic bacteriumThermotoga maritima (Tmax = 90 °C,Topt = 80 °C) has been completed and 24% of its genes have been reported to be more similar to archaeal genes than to other bacterial genes (13Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Nelson W.C. Ketchum K.A. McDonald L. Utterback T.R. Malek J.A. Linher K.D. Garrett M.M. Stewart A.M. Cotton M.D. Pratt M.S. Phillips C.A. Richardson D. Heidelberg J. Sutton G.G. Fleischmann R.D. Eisen J.A. White O. Salzberg S.L. Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Fraser C.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). As this is a much higher percentage than that found in mesophilic bacteria (3–7%), it has been suggested that considerable lateral gene transfer has occurred between archaea andT. maritima (13Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Nelson W.C. Ketchum K.A. McDonald L. Utterback T.R. Malek J.A. Linher K.D. Garrett M.M. Stewart A.M. Cotton M.D. Pratt M.S. Phillips C.A. Richardson D. Heidelberg J. Sutton G.G. Fleischmann R.D. Eisen J.A. White O. Salzberg S.L. Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Fraser C.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). In fact, T. maritima is believed to be one of the oldest and most slowly evolving lineages in the eubacteria (14Achenbach-Richter L. Gupta R. Stetter K. Woese C. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1987; 9: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore, classification of T. maritima chorismate synthase with regard to how it acquires the reduced FMN cofactor can be considered to reflect the nature of the ancestral enzyme. In addition, thermophilic proteins, as a result of residing in an extreme environment, are more stable and tend to display greater conformational rigidity than mesophilic proteins. Therefore, a comparison of the characteristics of a thermophilic chorismate synthase with that of a mesophilic counterpart may provide insights not only into the stability but also on the self-organization of this enzyme. Here we report the cloning, expression, and purification of chorismate synthase from the thermophilic eubacterium T. maritima. This is the first time that this enzyme has been described from an extremophilic organism. We show that the enzyme is monofunctional with respect to its requirement for FMN indicating that the ancestral protein was in fact monofunctional rather than bifunctional as had been proposed previously (12Macheroux P. Schmid J. Amrhein N. Schaller A. Planta. 1999; 207: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, we describe the characteristics of the thermophilic enzyme compared with those of the mesophilicE. coli chorismate synthase. In particular, we address the thermal stability as well as the spectrophotometric and electrophoretic properties of both the mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes in the presence and absence of ligands. We also report on the quaternary structure of T. maritima chorismate synthase. Restriction endonucleases and DNA modification enzymes were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany) or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Oligonucleotide sequencing and polymerase chain reaction primers were obtained from Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). All other chemicals were of the highest grade available. Basic molecular techniques were adopted from Ausubel et al. (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar) or Sambrook et al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Cell paste (1 g) of the thermophilic organism T. maritima (strain MSB8) was kindly provided by Dr. Huber (University of Regensburg, Germany). The genomic DNA was isolated using the QIAamp Tissue kit (Qiagen) according to the instructions described by the manufacturer. The DNA sequence of the T. maritima aroC gene which codes for chorismate synthase was obtained from GenBankTM (accession number AE001715.1). ThearoC gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (5′-primer, GGAATTCCATATGAAACTCACGATAGCGGGGGATTCC; 3′-primer, CCCAAGCTTCTACCGATAGTGCTCTTTCCAGAACCC) based on the MSB8 strain sequence and cloned into the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively, of pET21a (Novagen). This vector allows expression of T. maritima chorismate synthase under control of the IPTG inducible T7 promoter. The expression construct was verified by sequence analysis and transformed into either E. coliBL21(DE3) or E. coli BL21-CodonPlusTM (DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene). For analysis of expression, a single transformant was grown in 5 ml of 2 × YT medium supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin and this was used to inoculate a 50-ml culture. After 1 h at 37 °C, expression was induced by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Cells were allowed to grow for another 5 h at 37 °C and were then harvested by centrifugation and subsequently stored at −80 °C. E. coli cells (80 g) were resuspended in 20 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm potassium chloride, 10% glycerol, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 1.3 mm EDTA, and 1.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and after 20 min at room temperature the cells were further lysed by sonication. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min at room temperature. The supernatant was heated at 75 °C for 15 min after which the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation (25,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature). The supernatant from the heat treatment was then subjected to anion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 16 cm) freshly equilibrated in Buffer A. After washing with Buffer A, protein was eluted by a linear gradient of 250 ml of Buffer A and 250 ml of Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm potassium chloride, 10% glycerol, 0.4 mmdithiothreitol, 1.3 mm EDTA, and 1.3 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The progress of protein purification was monitored by 10% SDS-PAGE using the buffer system as described by Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Either a crude extract (as outlined above) from IPTG induced expression of E. coli BL21 CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells harboring the constructed pET-T. maritima aroC plasmid or the purified protein was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The electrophoresed sample was blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The band of interest was excised and subjected to automated Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer. For Western blot analysis, the samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with TBS (10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 0.9% sodium chloride) supplemented with 5% dry skimmed milk and 0.05% Tween 20. The blot was incubated for 90 min with an affinity purified antibody raised against chorismate synthase from the higher plant Corydalis sempervirens at a suitable dilution in the blocking buffer. The membrane was washed five times for 10 min each in TBST (TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20). It was then incubated for 45 min in TBST containing 5% dry skimmed milk and a sheep anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted 1:3000. After another five washes of 10 min each in TBST, the blot was developed using the chemiluminescent system and according to the protocol supplied by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Chorismate synthase activity was assayed using forward coupling of the reaction to anthranilate synthase at 30 °C essentially as described by Schaller et al. (7Schaller A. Windhofer V. Amrhein N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), except that the assay mixture used was 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, containing 30 mm ammonium sulfate, 10 mm glutamine, 4 mm magnesium sulfate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm FMN, 50 picokatal anthranilate synthase (from E. coli), and 80 μm EPSP. Either 5 mm sodium dithionite or 1 mm NADPH were used to start the reaction. CD measurements were performed with a Jasco-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a computer controlled water bath, using thermostatted cuvettes of 0.2-mm path length. Thermal unfolding curves were measured by continuously measuring the ellipticity at 222 nm between 3 and 92 °C at a scan rate of 1.0 degree min−1 and with data collection every 20 s. Protein samples were prepared for CD spectroscopy in 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm ammonium sulfate. Native PAGE was performed using the Pharmacia PhastSystem with an 8–25% gel run at pH 8.8 for 240 A·V·h over a period of 45 min at 15 °C. Either oxidized FMN and/or EPSP were added in 5-fold molar excess to samples of enzyme (13 μm, in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm ammonium sulfate) as indicated in the legend to Fig. 3and 20 min before beginning electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. The protein standards used were thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 and 132 kDa). Conventional sedimentation equilibrium measurements were made according to the method of Liu et al. (18Liu N. Deillon C. Klauser S. Gutte B. Thomas R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1214-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). The data were collected at 7,000, 9,000, and 12,000 rpm and at 20 °C. The sample volume was 120 μl at a protein concentration of 0.27 mg/ml in 10 mmTris, pH 7.4, containing 90 mm potassium chloride. Protein samples were dialyzed exhaustively in the above buffer before use. Absorbance spectra were recorded with a Uvikon 933 spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments AG, Zürich, Switzerland) equipped with a Haake D1 waterbath (Digitana AG, Horgen, Switzerland). The spectra were recorded in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm ammonium sulfate and by systematically varying either the substrate concentration or the temperature degree. Formation and decay of the flavin intermediate was observed using a stopped flow spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted 1-cm path length cell and a diode array detector (Spectroscopy Instruments GmbH, d-82205 Gilching) interfaced with a Macintosh IIcx computer. Data were acquired using SPECTRALYS 1.55 software (ZINS ZIEGLER-Instruments GmbH, Nobelstrasse 3–5, D-41189 Mönchengladbach). Rapid reactions were recorded between 300 and 600 nm, the integration time for collecting a spectrum was 10 ms with a resolution of 2 pixels/nm. FMN was reduced with sodium dithionite in anaerobic solutions of the substrate and a stoichiometric concentration of enzyme. The experiments were performed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm ammonium sulfate. Under the conditions used here, the polymerase chain reaction resulted in the amplification of a fragment which was ∼1150 base pairs in size. Including the engineered restriction sites (19 base pairs), this fragment thus corresponds to the predicted size of the encoding aroC gene from T. maritima (1128 base pairs) based on the DNA sequence and was confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. The PCR product obtained was cloned into the expression vector pET21a to create the construct pET-TmaroC. Expression of T. maritima chorismate synthase (41.7 kDa) could be obtained in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, as is the conventional protocol for this system (Fig. 1,panel A and B, lane 4), but greater expression could be achieved in E. coliBL21-CodonPlusTM(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene) presumably due to rare codon usage in TmaroC for arginine and isoleucine residues (Fig. 1, panel A, lane 8). The expression ofT. maritima chorismate synthase in BL21-CodonPlusTM(DE3)-RIL cells is ∼6-fold greater than that observed in BL21(DE3) (Fig. 1, panel B, compare protein loaded in lanes 4 and 8). However, expression in BL21-CodonPlusTM(DE3)-RIL cells appears to be independent of induction (Fig. 1, panel B, lanes 7 and 8). The majority of the recombinant fusion protein obtained was insoluble (Fig. 2, lane 2). The solubleT. maritima chorismate synthase fraction (Fig. 2, lane 3) was refined in the first instance by a heat precipitation step which was optimal at 75 °C. At this temperature the majority of the contaminating proteins precipitated (Fig. 2, lane 4) and could be removed by centrifugation, while the T. maritimachorismate synthase remained in solution (Fig. 2, lane 5). The most prominent contaminating protein remaining at this stage was chloramphenicol acetyltransferase from E. coli (25.7 kDa), as determined by N-terminal amino acid sequencing (15 cycles of 50 pmol of protein resolved the amino acids MEKKITGYTTVDISQ, which are identical to the data base entry for this protein, accession number CAA67774), and could be removed by chromatography using DEAE-Sephacel (Fig. 2, lane 6). The identity of the purified band asT. maritima chorismate synthase (41.7 kDa) was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing analysis (15 cycles of 50 pmol of protein resolved the amino acids MKLTIAGDSHGKYMV, which are identical to the data base entry for this chorismate synthase, accession number Q9WYI2), and the protein was estimated to be greater than 95% pure, as judged from SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lane 6). A typical yield of T. maritima chorismate synthase under these conditions was 30 mg from 80 g of E. coli cell paste.Figure 2Analysis of the purification of T. maritima chorismate synthase by SDS-PAGE. Lane 1, molecular mass markers as indicated; lane 2, pellet of crude cell extract after centrifugation; lane 3,supernatant of crude cell extract after centrifugation; lane 4, precipitated protein after heat treatment; lane 5,soluble protein after heat treatment; lane 6, purifiedT. maritima chorismate synthase (TmCS) after DEAE-Sephacel chromatography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The purified recombinant T. maritima chorismate synthase is catalytically active (TableI) and its specific activity in the presence of dithionite and at 30 °C is calculated as 135.5 nmol·mg−1·min−1. The specific activity obtained with T. maritima chorismate synthase (Table I) is lower than that obtained with two mesophilic chorismate synthases (Table I, N. crassa and E. coli), assayed under the same conditions, which is at least partly due to nonoptimal temperature conditions for the thermophilic enzyme. While there was a 2-fold increase in the specific activity of T. maritimachorismate synthase on performing the reaction at 37 °C (data not shown), the instability of anthranilate synthase above 40 °C (the coupling enzyme used in this assay) did not permit determination of the optimal temperature of T. maritima chorismate synthase using this assay. In order to determine if T. maritima chorismate synthase is mono- or bifunctional, the enzyme assay was performed with either flavin reduced by dithionite exogenously, or adding NADPH to ascertain if the enzyme has the intrinsic ability to reduce the FMN cofactor itself. In this way, the relative percentage of the enzyme activity obtained with the reduced flavin added exogenously to the intrinsic ability of the enzyme to reduce the FMN cofactor itself is a measure of its mono/bifunctionality (where approaching 100% indicates a bifunctional enzyme). As the specific activity obtained for T. maritima chorismate synthase in the presence of NADPH is only 0.5% of that in the presence of dithionite (Table I, T. maritima), it can be concluded that it is monofunctional. The respective activities of the monofunctional E. colichorismate synthase (Table I, E. coli) and the bifunctionalN. crassa chorismate synthase (Table I, N. crassa) are indicated as controls.Table IChorismate synthase (CS) activity in the presence of either dithionite or NADPHSource of proteinFlavin reductantCS activityRelative1-aNADPH/dithionite CS activity × 100.nmol·mg−1·min−1%T. maritimaDithionite136NADPH0.70.5N. crassaDithionite608NADPH40867.1E. coliDithionite812NADPH10513.0The specific activities of the chorismate synthases indicated were determined in the presence of either 5 mm dithionite or 1 mm NADPH at 30 °C in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, containing 30 mm ammonium sulfate, 10 mm glutamine, 4 mm magnesium sulfate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm FMN, 50 pkat of anthranilate synthase (from E. coli), and 80 μm EPSP. The results shown are the average of three determinations under partial anaerobic conditions.1-a NADPH/dithionite CS activity × 100. Open table in a new tab The specific activities of the chorismate synthases indicated were determined in the presence of either 5 mm dithionite or 1 mm NADPH at 30 °C in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, containing 30 mm ammonium sulfate, 10 mm glutamine, 4 mm magnesium sulfate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm FMN, 50 pkat of anthranilate synthase (from E. coli), and 80 μm EPSP. The results shown are the average of three determinations under partial anaerobic conditions. The stability of bothE. coli and T. maritima chorismate synthase in the presence and absence of both oxidized FMN and EPSP was examined using temperature unfolding experiments as measured by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3). The melting temperatures ofE. coli chorismate synthase in the absence and presence of ligands (54.7 ± 0.5 °C and 58.9 ± 0.04 °C, respectively) indicate a stabilizing effect of the ligands (Fig. 3,A-C). The melting temperature of T. maritimachorismate synthase was estimated to be a minimum of 92 °C in both the presence and absence of ligands (Fig. 3, D-F). However, the difference (if any) of the melting temperature for this enzyme with and without ligands could not be determined from these experiments. Chorismate synthase from E. coli has been reported to be a homotetramer (156 kDa) and when run on native-PAGE (8–25%) appears as a diffuse band with a mobility corresponding to an apparent mass of ∼190 kDa (19Macheroux P. Schönbrunn E. Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Koch M.H.J. Bornemann S. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When the enzyme is preincubated in the presence of both oxidized FMN and EPSP and subjected to native-PAGE as for the enzyme alone, there is a marked shift in the mobility toward the anode (140–150 kDa), which does not occur in the presence of either substrate alone (19Macheroux P. Schönbrunn E. Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Koch M.H.J. Bornemann S. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The same analysis was performed here withT. maritima chorismate synthase and its properties were compared with those of the E. coli enzyme (Fig.4). In contrast to the E. colienzyme (Fig. 4, E. coli chorismate synthase, lane 1), T. maritima chorismate synthase alone appears as a sharp band with a mobility corresponding to ∼200 kDa (Fig. 4,T. maritima chorismate synthase, lane 1). However, when T. maritima chorismate synthase is incubated in the presence of both oxidized FMN and EPSP, there is a slight shift in mobility toward the anode akin to what was observed with theE. coli enzyme but not nearly as pronounced (Fig. 4, comparelane 4 of E. coli and T. maritimachorismate synthase). Similar to what was observed with the E. coli enzyme, there is no apparent shift in the mobility ofT. maritima chorismate synthase when the enzyme is preincubated with either of the substrates alone (Fig. 4, comparelanes 2 and 3 of E. coli and T. maritima chorismate synthase, respectively). The molecular mass of T. maritima chorismate synthase was estimated by performing sedimentation equilibrium experiments at a variety of operational speeds in an analytical ultracentrifuge. A representative data set from a sedimentation equilibrium experiment is shown in Fig.5. The data can be interpreted as resulting from a single ideal species according to the model of Liuet al. (18Liu N. Deillon C. Klauser S. Gutte B. Thomas R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1214-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) under all the conditions used. The molecular mass of the enzyme was calculated to be 168,377 ± 1950 Da under each of the conditions used. The molecular mass of the monomer estimated from the amino acid sequence is 41,754 Da. In addition, the enzyme prepared here gave a single homogenous band on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of ≈42 kDa. Therefore, it can be concluded thatT. maritima chorismate synthase is a tetramer of identical subunits. Chorismate synthase isolated from T. maritimaunder the conditions used here, showed a single absorption maximum at 278 nm (Fig. 6, panel A). There were no absorbance maxima characteristic for bound flavin (i.e. ≈370 nm and ≈450 nm), thus indicating that chorismate synthase is isolated as the apoenzyme form. Oxidized free FMN (25 μmin 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 50 mmammonium sulfate) exhibits absorption maxima at 372 and 445 nm, respectively (Fig. 6, panel A). Addition of 28 μm chorismate synthase to 25 μm oxidized FMN at room temperature caused no perturbation of these maxima (Fig. 6,panel A). Subjecting this solution to ultracentrifugation (Centricon 30) allowed the estimation of a KD of 137 μm for binding of oxidized FMN to the enzyme at room temperature (Table II). This result indicates the weak binding of the oxidized co-factor under these conditions and accounts for the isolation of the protein in the apoenzyme form and is akin to what has been observed with E. coli chorismate synthase (20Macheroux P. Petersen J. Bornemann S. Lowe D.J. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A gradual increase of the temperature of the chorismate synthase-oxidized FMN solution to 66 °C led to a hypsochromic shift of the absorption maximum at 372 to 360 nm and was accompanied by a hypochromic effect on the absorption intensity in this region (Fig. 6, panel B). Albeit to a lesser degree, the increase in temperature also produced an increase in the resolution of the absorption maximum around 450 nm and induced a slight hypsochromic shift of the absorption maximum in this region from 445 to 442 nm (Fig. 6, panel B). The KDfor the binding of oxidized FMN to the chorismate synthase after this heating step was estimated to be 3 μm, indicating 46"
https://openalex.org/W2025383769,"This is the first report of a novel serine/threonine kinase, rabbit death-associated protein (DAP) kinase-related apoptosis-inducing protein kinase 1 (rDRAK1), involved in osteoclast apoptosis. We searched for osteoclast-specific genes from a cDNA library of highly enriched rabbit osteoclasts cultured on ivory. One of the cloned genes has a high homology with human DRAK1 (hDRAK1), which belongs to the DAP kinase subfamily of serine/threonine kinases. By screening a rabbit osteoclast cDNA library and 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends), we obtained a full length of this cDNA, termed rDRAK1. The sequencing data indicated that rDRAK1 has 88.0, 44.6, 38.7, and 42.3% identity with hDRAK1, DAP kinase, DRP-1, and ZIP (zipper-interacting protein) kinase, respectively. To clarify the role of DRAK1 in osteoclasts, we examined the effect of three osteoclast survival factors (interleukin-1, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and osteoclast differentiation-inducing factor) on rDRAK1 mRNA expression and the effect of rDRAK1 overexpression on osteoclast apoptosis. The results suggested that these three survival factors were proved to inhibit rDRAK1 expression in rabbit osteoclasts. After transfection of a rDRAK1 expression vector into cultured osteoclasts, overexpressed rDRAK1 was localized exclusively to the nuclei and induced apoptosis. Hence, rDRAK1 may play an important role in the core apoptosis program in osteoclast. This is the first report of a novel serine/threonine kinase, rabbit death-associated protein (DAP) kinase-related apoptosis-inducing protein kinase 1 (rDRAK1), involved in osteoclast apoptosis. We searched for osteoclast-specific genes from a cDNA library of highly enriched rabbit osteoclasts cultured on ivory. One of the cloned genes has a high homology with human DRAK1 (hDRAK1), which belongs to the DAP kinase subfamily of serine/threonine kinases. By screening a rabbit osteoclast cDNA library and 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends), we obtained a full length of this cDNA, termed rDRAK1. The sequencing data indicated that rDRAK1 has 88.0, 44.6, 38.7, and 42.3% identity with hDRAK1, DAP kinase, DRP-1, and ZIP (zipper-interacting protein) kinase, respectively. To clarify the role of DRAK1 in osteoclasts, we examined the effect of three osteoclast survival factors (interleukin-1, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and osteoclast differentiation-inducing factor) on rDRAK1 mRNA expression and the effect of rDRAK1 overexpression on osteoclast apoptosis. The results suggested that these three survival factors were proved to inhibit rDRAK1 expression in rabbit osteoclasts. After transfection of a rDRAK1 expression vector into cultured osteoclasts, overexpressed rDRAK1 was localized exclusively to the nuclei and induced apoptosis. Hence, rDRAK1 may play an important role in the core apoptosis program in osteoclast. death-associated protein kinase DAP kinase-related apoptosis-inducing protein kinase the rapid amplification of cDNA ends protocol DAP kinase-related protein 1 zipper-interacting protein kinase interleukin 1 macrophage colony stimulating factor osteoclast differentiation inducing factor nuclear factor-κB receptor activator of NF-κB ligand tumor necrosis factor-related activation-induced cytokine osteoprotegerin OPG ligand osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor tumor necrosis factor receptor-like molecule 1 colony stimulating factor 1 transforming growth factor-β reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling α-minimum essential medium fetal bovine serum phosphate-buffered saline digoxigenin. Osteoclasts are multinucleated giant cells with the resorbing activity of calcified tissues. Stem cells for osteoclasts are present in the hematopoietic tissue (1Suda T. Takahashi N. Martin T.J. Endocr. Rev. Monogr. 1995; 4: 266-270Google Scholar). How the mononuclear stem cells fuse and differentiate into mature osteoclasts has begun to be clarified with the identification of osteoclast differentiation-inducing factor (ODF)1/receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL)/tumor necrosis factor-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE)/osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL) (2Anderson D.M.

After maturation, osteoclasts undergo a multistep resorption process (resorption cycle) that involves matrix recognition, osteoclast attachment, polarization and formation of a sealing zone on the bone, and resorption itself, with final detachment and possible cell death (9Väänänen H.K.

It has been reported that osteoclasts die by apoptosis at the end of the bone resorption process (11Kameda T. Ishikawa H. Tsutsui T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and that control of apoptosis might potentially represent a key step in the regulation of bone resorption (remodeling). It has been suggested that the drugs with the most potential in the treatment of osteoporosis, bisphosphonates (12Hughes D.E. Wright K.R. Uy H.L. Sasaki A. Yoneda T. Roodman G.D. Mundy G.R.

Oscteoclast culture in vitro has shown that interleukin 1 (IL-1), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)/colony stimulating-factor-1, and ODF/RANKL/TRANCE/OPGL support osteoclast survival (14Suda T.

For several years, we have tried to clone osteoclast-specific genes involved in osteoclast resorption (cycle) including apoptosis. For this purpose, it was necessary to isolate primary osteoclasts of sufficient numbers and purity for biochemical or molecular biological study. Recently, an efficient method for the isolation of rabbit osteoclasts, established by Kakudo et al. (18Kakudo S. Miyazawa K. Kameda T. Mano H. Mori Y. Yuasa T. Nakamura Y. Shiokawa M. Nagahira K. Tokunaga S. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 1996; 14: 129-136Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), has contributed to many studies on osteoclasts (19Kameda T. Mano H. Yamada Y. Takai H.

Using a cDNA library of highly enriched rabbit osteoclasts, we obtained several fragments of genes that might be related to the osteoclast resorption cycle. One of them has high homology with hDRAK1, a member of the DAP kinase subfamily (25Sanjo H. Kawai T. Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29066-29071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 26Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), and it was termed as rDRAK1. DAP kinase is a calcium/calmodulin-regulated serine/threonine protein kinase and an effector of γ-interferon-mediated apoptosis in HeLa cells (26Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the role of rDRAK1 in rabbit osteoclast apoptosis, we identified the full sequence of rDRAK1 and verified the effect of typical osteoclast survival factors (IL-1, M-CSF, and ODF) on DRAK1 mRNA expression by a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. We also examined the overexpressed rDRAK1-inducing apoptosis in rabbit osteoclasts by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL). Osteoclasts were harvested from 10-day-old Japanese white rabbits according to the method of Kakudoet al. (18Kakudo S. Miyazawa K. Kameda T. Mano H. Mori Y. Yuasa T. Nakamura Y. Shiokawa M. Nagahira K. Tokunaga S. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 1996; 14: 129-136Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the long bones were minced with scissors for 15 min in α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies, Inc.). The unfractioned cells were collected and seeded on collagen gel (Nitta Gelatin Inc.)-coated dishes. After 3 h of incubation, the cells were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.001% Pronase (Sigma) and 0.02% EDTA for 15 min at room temperature to remove the nonadherent hematopoietic cells; this was followed by treatment with 0.01% collagenase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) for 5 min at room temperature to further remove most of the stromal cells. Finally, osteoclasts were obtained in suspension by treatment with 0.1% collagenase at 37 °C for 10 min. The yield and purity of osteoclasts from one rabbit was 1–3 × 104 and more than 90%, respectively. Purified osteoclasts were seeded on round ivory slices (6.5-mm radius) in four kinds of medium: α-MEM with 5% FBS supplemented with 1.0 ng/ml IL-1 (mouse recombinant, Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 ng/ml M-CSF (mouse recombinant, Calbiochem), or 500 ng/ml ODF (mouse recombinant, Calbiochem) and no supplement. When the cells were prepared for transfection, the use of 0.001% Pronase, 0.02% EDTA and 0.01% collagenase was omitted. After 3 h of incubation, the nonadherent cells were washed out with PBS, and the osteoclasts were then collected with 0.1% collagenase. This short procedure yielded 2–5 × 104 osteoclasts/rabbit with 30–50% purity. The purified rabbit osteoclasts were cultured on sliced ivory with α-MEM containing 5% FBS for 3 h at 37 °C. Total RNA was then extracted and further purified with TRIzol®reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following reverse transcription of the RNA, we constructed a cDNA library of highly enriched rabbit osteoclasts cultured on ivory by using THE SMART™ cDNA Library Construction Kit (CLONTECH). The cDNA fragment cloned into The pCR-TRAP vector (GenHunter Co.) was sequenced using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI model 310, PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems). Then, the full-length cDNA of the gene was obtained by screening the rabbit osteoclast cDNA library and the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA obtained was labeled with a DIG DNA labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics) and used as probe for tissue distribution. The determined DNA sequences were subjected to a homology search against the BLAST nucleotide sequence data base. The total RNA of rabbit tissue (bone marrow, brain, lung, liver, and kidney) was isolated and further purified by the TRIzol method. A nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) of suitable size was used after soaking in 10× standard saline citrate (SSC) for 10 min. The RNA (10 μg) in denatured solution was heated at 65 °C for 15 min and then immediately chilled on ice. The RNA mixture was blotted onto nylon membrane followed by heating membrane at 80 °C for 2 h. Hybridization with standard hybridization buffer containing digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probe at a concentration of 2 μg/ml was carried out overnight at 65 °C. After washing the membrane, the color was developed with a DIG DNA detection kit (Roche Diagnostics). The obtained cDNA clone was prepared as DIG-labeled probe with a DIG DNA labeling kit. The density of the positive spots was analyzed with NIH Image software. In this case, DIG-labeled β-actin was used as an internal standard. Each experiment was done twice (two batches using two rabbits) and independently (n = 2). Total RNA was isolated from osteoclasts using TRIzol® reagent. For reverse transcription, the reaction mixture contained 2 μg of RNA, 2.5 μmoligo(dT) primer, and 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (AMV, TaKaRa) in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was performed by incubation for 1 h at 42 °C and stopped by heating for 5 min at 99 °C. Aliquots (0.5 μl) of the reverse transcriptase products were amplified in the reaction mixture (20 μl) containing LightCycler™-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I, 0.5 μm each primer, and 3 mm MgCl2using LightCycler™ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After pre-incubation at 95 °C for 10 min, a PCR was performed with 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 5 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 10 s. A single fluorescence reading was taken in each cycle following the elongation step. The primers used were as follows: rDRAK1, 5′-CGTGGTTGACACAGAGCAGT-3′ (corresponding to 905–924) and 5′-TTCGGTTCCTGGTTTCTCAG-3′ (1016–1035); rabbit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal standard, 5′-CGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGA-3′ and 5′-CCAGCATCGAAGGTAGAGGA-3′. The GenBankTM accession number for rabbit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is L23961. The relative rDRAK1 mRNA levels for each condition were determined by performing quantitative RT-PCR three times for each of the six independent batches (n = 6). We subcloned the full-length rDRAK1 and LacZ into the pcDNA4/HisMaxA expression vector (Invitrogen) to create His-tagged rDRAK1 and LacZ expression vectors. The semi-purified osteoclasts were cultured on FBS-coated 4-well glass chamber slides (Nunc) for 24 h at 37 °C. Transfection was done by using Tfx™-50 reagent (Promega). After the cultivation period, the cells were incubated in the presence of 0.1–0.5 μg of His-rDRAK1 or His-LacZ in α-MEM containing 5% FBS and 100 nm Tfx™-50 and then cultured for 6 h at 37 °C. After 6 h of incubation, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (TAAB Laboratories Ltd.) and were blocked with 5% skim milk containing 0.05% Triton X-100. They were then incubated with mouse anti-6-His monoclonal antibody (Babco Covance Co.) at 4 °C overnight. After being washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS three times, the cells were stained with goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 2 h at room temperature. After three more washes, the nuclei were stained with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI, Sigma), and the samples were embedded in 0.1% paraphenylenediamine (Sigma) in glycerol. The cells were then observed under a laser confocal scanning microscope (MRC-600 UV, Bio-Rad). After 6 h of incubation in the presence of Tfx™-50 and His-rDRAK1 or His-LacZ expression vector, TUNEL was performed with an in situ cell death detection kit-alkaline phosphatase (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after the cultivation, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, washed with PBS, and then permeabilized in 0.1% sodium citrate containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min on ice. After permeabilization, the cells were incubated in a TUNEL reaction mixture comprising terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase for 60 min at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and incubated in anti-fluorescein antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. After a reaction using nitroblue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (NBT/BCIP, Roche Diagnostics) and 4-toluidine salt as substrates for alkaline phosphatase, the stained cells were analyzed under a light microscope. We have cloned several gene fragments of osteoclast, which might be related to each resorption process (27Uemura T. Honma R. Nemoto A. Liu Y.K. 27th European Symposium on Calcified Tissues, Tampere, Finland, May –, 2000.in: Vaananen H.K. European Calified Tissue Sowety. Springer, Berlin2000: 6-10Google Scholar). One of these fragments has a sequence of 291 base pairs located at the 3′-terminus as shown in Fig. 1. By comparison with the nucleotide data base of BLAST, it was found to have high homology with hDRAK1, in which the catalytic domain is related to that of DAP kinase, a serine/threonine kinase involved in apoptosis. In this paper, we focus on this gene and its role in osteoclast apoptosis. To obtain a full-length copy of the fragment related to hDRAK1, screening of a rabbit osteoclast cDNA library and 5′-RACE were performed. This cDNA library was constructed from osteoclasts attached to ivory and included 1.7 × 106 independent clones. For 5′-RACE, the RNA extracted from bone marrow cells was used as a template. The predicted amino acid sequence of the obtained full-length cDNA, termed rDRAK1, is 397 residues long (Fig. 1) and is 88.0, 58.4, 44.6, 38.7, and 42.3% identical to hDRAK1, hDRAK2, DAP kinase, DRP-1, and ZIP kinase (25Sanjo H.

The putative kinase domain of rDRAK1 is located at the N terminus and contains all 11 subdomains conserved among serine/threonine kinases (Fig. 2).Figure 2Alignment of amino acid sequences of rDRAK1, hDRAK1/2, DAP kinase, DRP-1, and ZIP kinase.

This result is consistent with the presence of mature osteoclasts in bone marrow tissue. DRAK1 expression levels in brain and lung are similar, and the expression in heart is the weakest. To elucidate the role of DRAK1 in osteoclast apoptosis, it is necessary to examine the effect of osteoclast survival factors on DRAK1 mRNA expression. However, to carry out such a series of experiments, the osteoclast mRNA from 10 rabbits was needed. The usual semi-quantitative RT-PCR method was not adequate. Therefore, we adopted a quantitative RT-PCR method for this analysis, as described under “Experimental Procedures,”; using a LightCycler™ system and reagents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Typical examples of the use of this system are cited in the references (31Miyauchi A. Notoya K. Mikuni-Takagaki Y. Takagi Y. Goto M. Miki Y. Takano-Yamamoto T. Jinnai K. Takahashi K. Kumegawa M.

Fig. 4 A shows the effect of the osteoclast survival factors on DRAK1 mRNA expression. The three factors inhibited DRAK1 expression by 51, 34, and 57% (IL-1, M-CSF, and ODF, respectively). We observed the inhibition of DRAK1 expression by survival factors to be partial. With survival factors, DRAK1 is still expressed in osteoclasts. At the same time, optical microscopic images are shown in Fig. 4 B, suggesting that those three factors induced spreading of osteoclasts. It has been reported that hDRAKs are exclusively localized to the nuclei (25Sanjo H. Kawai T. Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29066-29071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To investigate the cellular localization of rDRAK1, the expression plasmids His-rDRAK1 and His-LacZ were transiently transfected into osteoclasts. After a cultivation period, the His-tagged proteins were detected by indirect immunostaining with anti-His monoclonal antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. All nuclei could be simultaneously visualized by staining with propidium iodide. As seen in Fig. 5, a–c, the fluorescent signals showed that LacZ localized in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus. On the other hand, in rDRAK1-transfected osteoclasts, the fluorescent signals and the nuclei stained by propidium iodide overlapped as shown in Fig. 5, d–f. These results indicated that rDRAK1 is exclusively localized to the nuclei. Most of the DAP kinase family has the ability to induce apoptosis in various cells (25Sanjo H. Kawai T. Akira S. J. Biol.

To investigate whether rDRAK1 induces apoptosis in osteoclasts, we performed a TUNEL assay to detect DNA fragmentation after transfection. As shown in Fig.6, the nuclei of rDRAK1-transfected osteoclasts were stained strongly, indicating that the nucleus condensed and was then fragmentated. Chromatin condensation followed by fragmentation is a specific morphological characteristic of apoptosis; therefore, rDRAK1 induced apoptosis in osteoclasts when it was overexpressed. On the other hand, overexpression of His-LacZ did not affect the DNA fragmentation or the nuclear morphology of osteoclasts. This is the first report of a novel serine/threonine kinase, rDRAK1, involved in osteoclast apoptosis. In the past 5 years, much work has been done relating to osteoclast apoptosis of the basic and clinical level, with many studies using bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonates are known to inhibit bone resorption and to be therapeutically effective in diseases involving increased bone turnover, such as Paget's disease. Apoptosis has proved to be a major mechanism whereby bisphosphonates reduce osteoclast numbers and activity (12Hughes D.E. Wright K.R. Uy H.L. Sasaki A. Yoneda T. Roodman G.D. Mundy G.R. Boyce B.F.

https://openalex.org/W2068002815,"Human thymic CD1a−CD4+ T cells in the final stage of thymic maturation are susceptible to anergy induced by a superantigen, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1). Thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts, established by stimulating human thymic CD1a−CD4+ T cells with TSST-1 in vitro, produce a low level of interleukin-2 after restimulation with TSST-1, whereas TSST-1-induced adult peripheral blood (APB) CD4+ T-cell blasts produce high levels of interleukin-2. The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of the T-cell receptor ζ chain induced after restimulation with TSST-1 was 2–4-fold higher in APB CD4+ T-cell blasts than in thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts. The tyrosine kinase activity of Lck was low in both thymic and APB CD4+ T-cell blasts before restimulation with TSST-1. After restimulation, the Lck kinase activity increased in APB CD4+ T-cell blasts but not in thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts. Surprisingly, Lck was highly tyrosine-phosphorylated in both thymic and APB CD4+ T-cell blasts before restimulation with TSST-1. After restimulation, it was markedly dephosphorylated in APB CD4+ T-cell blasts but not in thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts. Lck from APB CD4+T-cell blasts bound the peptide containing the phosphotyrosine at the negative regulatory site of Lck-505 indicating that the site of dephosphorylation in TSST-1-activated T-cell blasts is Tyr-505. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that colocalization of Lck and CD45 was induced after restimulation with TSST-1 in APB CD4+T-cell blasts but not in thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts. Further, remarkable accumulation of Lck in the membrane raft was observed in restimulated APB CD4+ T-cell blasts but not in thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts. These data indicate that interaction between Lck and CD45 is suppressed physically in thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts and plays a critical role in sustaining an anergic state.

Seo K. Kato H. Miyoshi-Akiyama T. Zhang R.H. Takahashi Y. Imai Y. Uchiyama T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 112-119PubMed Google Scholar, 3Takahashi N. Imanishi K. Nishida H. Uchiyama T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5213-5219PubMed Google Scholar). These characteristics indicate that cord blood and thymic CD4+ T cells are still functionally immature and that a post-thymic maturation process occurs in human peripheral blood T cells. To understand why these cells respond differently, it is essential to analyze the signal transduction pathway via T-cell receptor stimulation in anergic TSST-1-induced thymic CD4+T-cell blasts. Signal transduction via TCR stimulation involves at least two pathways: (i) activation of phospholipase C-γ1 and (ii) activation of the Ras-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway. Both pathways require the activation of Src family kinases such as Lck and Fyn. Although mature T cells are highly resistant to anergy induction, they are rendered anergic when stimulated through TCR in the absence of costimulatory signals such as the CD28 molecule (4Mueller D.L. Jenkins M.K. Shwartz R.H. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2617-2627PubMed Google Scholar). Anergic T cells display various alterations in the two above mentioned pathways, including failure of ZAP-70, Ras, ERK (extracellular signal-related kinase), JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase), or AP-1 activation after restimulation with antigens (5Migita K. Eguchi K. Kawabe Y. Tsukada T. Ichinose Y. Nagataki S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5083-5087PubMed Google Scholar, 6Li W. Whaley C.D. Mondio A. Muller D.L.

They also display constitutively elevated concentrations of intracellular free calcium and inositolphosphate, as well as increased tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1, Fyn, and Cbl (10Gajewski T.F.

It is not yet clear whether these defects are involved in the anergic state induced by TSST-1 in human thymic CD4+ T cells. In the present study, we addressed the question of why human thymic CD1a−CD4+ T cells are induced into an anergic state after stimulation with TSST-1 by comparing signal transduction in anergic TSST-1-induced thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts with that in highly responsive TSST-1-induced APB CD4+ T-cell blasts. The results strongly suggest that the absence of an interaction between Lck and CD45 (which possesses phosphatase activity) is responsible for maintaining the anergic state of human thymic CD1a−CD4+ T cells induced by TSST-1. Antibodies (Abs) I2C3 (anti-HLA-DR/DP) and Nu Ts/c (anti-CD8) have been described previously (13Akatsuka H. Imanishi K. Inada K. Yamashita H. Yoshida M. Uchiyama T. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1994; 96: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The following Abs were available commercially: a hybridoma cell line, OKT6 (anti-CD1a, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA); FITC-conjugated SK3 (anti-CD4), phycoerythrin-conjugated SK1 (anti-CD8) and FITC- or phycoerythrin-conjugated SK7 (anti-CD3, Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA); RD-1 conjugated I2 (anti-DR, Coulter Immunology, Hialeah, FL); biotin-conjugated E22E7.2 (anti-Vβ2) and FITC-conjugated UCHL.1 (anti-CD45RO, Immunotech, Marseille, France); FITC-conjugated anti-CD28 (Immunotech, Marseille, France); FITC-conjugated avidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA); 4G10 (anti-phosphotyrosine, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY); 6B10.2 (anti-TCRζ and anti-CD45 (M-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); and FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 and Texas red-conjugated avidin (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). The anti-Lck Ab was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Koga (Tokai University, Japan). The procedures used for preparing human lymphoid cells have been described previously (2Imanishi K. Seo K. Kato H. Miyoshi-Akiyama T. Zhang R.H. Takahashi Y. Imai Y. Uchiyama T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 112-119PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, APB mononuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy adult donors by Ficoll-Conray density gradient centrifugation. Whole APB T cells were obtained by the sheep red blood cell rosette method. After obtaining written informed consent, single-cell suspensions of thymocytes were obtained from thymus fragments dissected from donors, ranging in age from 3 to 24 years, during corrective cardiac surgery. To obtain APB CD4+ T cells, whole APB T cells were treated with Abs Nu Ts/c and I2C3. To obtain thymic CD1a−CD4+ T cells, thymocytes were first treated with peanut agglutinin, and then non-aggregated T cells were treated with a combination of Abs Nu Ts/c, I2C3, and OKT6. After washing, these Ab-treated cells were mixed with anti-mouse IgG coupled to magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Dynal, Oslo, Norway), and the mixtures were kept on ice for 30 min. Unbound cells were separated with a magnet and suspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 10% fetal calf serum, and 5 × 10−5m2-mercaptoethanol. The preparations of APB CD4+ and thymic CD1a−CD4+ T cells contained <5% CD8+ T cells, 5% CD8+ T cells, and 1% CD1a+ T cells, respectively. DR+ L cells (8124) were used as antigen-presenting cells (APC). Before use as APC, DR+ L cells were irradiated at 30 gray with an x-ray irradiator and treated with 50 μg/ml mitomycin C for 30 min at 37 °C. APC were added to each well of microplates, 1 × 105 cells/well for 48-well plates or 1 × 106 cells/well for 6-well plates, and allowed to adhere overnight at 37 °C. TSST-1-induced T-cell blasts were obtained as described previously (3Takahashi N. Imanishi K. Nishida H. Uchiyama T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5213-5219PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, APB CD4+ and thymic CD1a−CD4+ T cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml TSST-1 (Toxin Technology, Inc., Sarasota, FL) on an APC monolayer for 3 days. Recovered cells were subjected to Percoll (density = 1.068) centrifugation. The large lymphoblasts obtained at the interface of the culture medium and Percoll were expanded by incubation with 100 units/ml recombinant IL-2 (Takeda Chemical Industries, Kyoto, Japan) for 4 days. Recovered cells were subjected to Percoll centrifugation. T-cell blasts were obtained at the interface between densities 1.050 and 1.068. For the assay of IL-2, T-cell blasts (5 × 105 cells/well) were stimulated with 10 ng/ml TSST-1 on an APC monolayer for various periods in 0.5-ml volumes in 48-well culture plates (Corning Glass). IL-2 activity in the culture supernatants was determined using IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells as reported previously (14Uchiyama T. Kamagata Y. Yan X-J. Kohno M. Yoshioka M. Fujikawa H. Igarashi H. Okubo M. Awano F. Saito-Taki T. Nakano M. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1987; 68: 638-647PubMed Google Scholar). Data are presented as units/ml IL-2. For expression of CD4versus CD8, CD3 versus Vβ2, CD3versus CD28, CD3 versus CD45RO, and CD3versus HLA-DR in the T-cell preparations, T cells were stained with several combinations of the appropriate phycoerythrin-, RD1-, and FITC-conjugated Abs and examined by two-color flow cytometric analysis using an EPICS CS flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL) as described previously (3Takahashi N. Imanishi K. Nishida H. Uchiyama T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5213-5219PubMed Google Scholar). All procedures for cell staining were conducted on ice. T-cell blasts (2 × 107 cells/well) were restimulated with 2 μg/ml TSST-1 at 37 °C in 1-ml volumes in 6-well culture plates containing tightly adherent APC. At different time points, cultures were terminated by adding 5 ml of cold PBS, and T-cell blasts were collected immediately. After washing with cold PBS, the T-cell blasts were lysed in cold TNE buffer (containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and 300 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were pre-cleared with Protein A/G Plus-agarose (Oncogene Science Inc., Uniondale, NY) and then incubated with Protein A/G Plus-agarose coupled to the respective antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with the indicated Ab followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein G (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) as the second Ab. The immunoblots were developed with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). T-cell blasts were solubilized in TNE buffer as described for immunoprecipitation, and the supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation for 2 h with an anti-Lck Ab. Immunoprecipitates were washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (TNE buffer containing 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS) followed by washing buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.5 m LiCl. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 3 mm MnCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 μm cold ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) per sample. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 30 °C; the samples were then centrifuged, and the supernatants were separated by reducing 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After drying, the radioactivity bound to the gels was analyzed with a Molecular Imager System FX (Bio-Rad). The sequence of a tyrosine-phosphorylated Lck carboxyl-terminal peptide (LckP peptide) containing the carboxyl-terminal 11 amino acids of Lck, Thr-Ala-Thr-Glu-Gly-Gln-Tyr-(PO3H2)-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro, has been described by Sieh et al. (15Sieh M. Bolen J.B. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Biotin-conjugated LckP peptide was synthesized by BEX (Tokyo, Japan). Precipitation of LckP peptide was done as described previously (15Sieh M. Bolen J.B. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates from T-cell blasts stimulated as described in immunoprecipitation were incubated with 50 μg/ml biotinylated LckP peptide for 2 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 h. The precipitates were subjected to analysis by immunoblotting procedures as described above. For immunofluorescence staining of CD45 and Lck, T-cell blasts were washed with PBS and fixed for 30 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature on glass slides pretreated with Cell-Tak (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA). Glass slides were then incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min to permeabilize the attached T-cell blasts and blocked for 15 min with 1% skimmed milk. The glass slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with biotinylated anti-Lck Ab and FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 Ab at the appropriate concentrations followed by the incubation with Texas red-conjugated avidin as the second Ab overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing with PBS, the glass slides were mounted using a glycerol solution containing anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Confocal imaging was performed with a laser head (MRC-600, Bio-Rad). Samples were excited at 488 and 568 nm, and fluorescein and Texas red signals were detected through the K2 and K1 filter blocks, respectively. Images were collected using the photon counting mode of the COMOS program (Bio-Rad). In double-labeling experiments, bleed-through of the Texas red signal into the fluorescein channel was negligible. To obtain the raft membrane fraction, T-cell blasts (7.5 × 107) were lysed with 1 ml of cold TNE buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% TX-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 1300 × g to remove the nuclei and large cellular debris. For equilibrium centrifugation of the TX-100 lysates, the lysates was diluted with an equal volume of 80% w/v sucrose in TNE buffer. Then 0.8 ml of lysate-sucrose mixture was overlaid sequentially with 2 ml of 30% sucrose and 1 ml of 4% sucrose prepared in TNE, and the mixture was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C in an RPS 50–2 rotor (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The gradient was fractionated into 0.5-ml fractions from the top of the tube. The raft and TX-100-soluble fractions were obtained in fractions 1–3 and 6–7, respectively. A summary of the surface phenotypes of TSST-1-induced thymic and APB CD4+ T-cell blasts used in this study is presented in TableI (under “Immunologic phenotypes”). Both type of cells show the phenotypes of TSST-1-reactive T cells. The percentage of TCR Vβ2+ T cells, which are the major TSST-1-reactive human T-cell fraction (16Choi Y. Kotzin B Herron L. Callahan J. Marrack P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8941-8945Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), was around 80% in both the thymic and APB T cell preparations. The intensity of TCR expression was equivalent in both preparations (data not shown). Most of the Vβ2-negative T cells among the thymic and APB T-cell blasts were likely to be other TSST-1-reactive fractions such as Vβ4+ T cells (17Kato H. Fujimaki W. Narimatsu H. Yagi J. Imanishi K. Uchiyama T. J. Tokyo Womens Med. College. 1994; 64: 985-993Google Scholar). The percentage of CD28+ T cells increased from around 70% before to around 90% after blast formation in both the thymic and APB T cell preparations, and the percentage of CD45RO+ T cells increased to a similar extent among both types of T-cell blasts. It should be noted that the percentage of HLA DR+ T cells was 3-fold lower among the thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts than among the APB CD4+ T-cell blasts. The APB and thymic CD4+T-cell blasts were then restimulated with TSST-1 (10 ng/ml) on an APC monolayer and examined for IL-2 production (Table I, under “IL-2 production”). IL-2 production was much lower in the thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts than in the APB CD4+ T-cell blasts; the amount of IL-2 produced by the former was at most 10% of that produced by the latter. However, both the thymic and APB CD4+ T-cell blasts exhibited substantial IL-2 production upon stimulation with a combination of PMA and ionomycin (data not shown). These results indicate that thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts are in an anergic state following exposure to TSST-1.Table IImmunologic phenotypes of thymic and APB CD4+ T cells before and after blast formation and TSST-1-induced IL-2 production of thymic and APB CD4+ T-cell blastsImmunologic phenotypes 1-aThe immunologic phenotypes of the CD4+ T cells were analyzed before and after blast formation with TSST-1.IL-2 production1-bTSST-1-induced CD4+ T-cell blasts (5 × 105 cells/well) were restimulated with 10 ng/ml TSST-1 on an APC monolayer (5 × 104 cells/well), and the culture supernatants were examined for IL-2 activity.PhenotypeBefore or after blast formationExpressionExp.CD4+ T-cell blastsStimulation period (h)Thymic T cellsAPB T cells2616%units/mlCD3+Before87.3 ± 7.868.8 ± 1.71APB12923552290After98.5 ± 1.098.0 ± 1.3Thymic94227Vβ2+After74.9 ± 9.481.3 ± 10.22APB51488628CD4+Before81.6 ± 3.560.4 ± 4.2Thymic65623After90.2 ± 6.995.3 ± 3.23APB48788818CD28+Before63.4 ± 1.468.9 ± 7.6Thymic157323After90.5 ± 8.294.4 ± 3.34APB1331530978CD45RO+After71.8 ± 12.672.9 ± 16.5Thymic159653HLA DR+After23.5 ± 8.865.2 ± 6.4Thymic and APB CD4+ T-cell blasts were prepared by stimulating thymic and APB CD4+ T cells with 10 ng/ml TSST-1 for 3 days on an APC monolayer and then expanding the large lymphoblasts with recombinant IL-2 for 4 days.1-a The immunologic phenotypes of the CD4+ T cells were analyzed before and after blast formation with TSST-1.1-b TSST-1-induced CD4+ T-cell blasts (5 × 105 cells/well) were restimulated with 10 ng/ml TSST-1 on an APC monolayer (5 × 104 cells/well), and the culture supernatants were examined for IL-2 activity. Open table in a new tab Thymic and APB CD4+ T-cell blasts were prepared by stimulating thymic and APB CD4+ T cells with 10 ng/ml TSST-1 for 3 days on an APC monolayer and then expanding the large lymphoblasts with recombinant IL-2 for 4 days. When T cells are activated by antigens, tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCRζ chain is induced (18Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 209-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCRζ chain was therefore compared between TSST-1-induced thymic and APB CD4+ T-cell blasts. T-cell blasts were restimulated with TSST-1 (2 μg/ml) on an APC monolayer and cell lysates were prepared. The ζ chain was immunoprecipitated and the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine Ab. As shown in the upper part of Fig.1 A, tyrosine phosphorylation of the ζ chain was minimal in the absence of TSST-1 restimulation but showed significant increase after restimulation in both the thymic and APB T-cell blasts. The extent of phosphorylation was 2- to 4-fold higher in APB CD4+ T-cell blasts than in thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts. No difference in expression of the ζ chain was detected between the two T-cell populations (lower part of Fig. 1 A). Because up-regulation of the tyrosine kinase activity of Lck plays a critical role in T-cell activation through TCR (19Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), the kinase activity of the Lck present in TSST-1-induced thymic and APB CD4+ T-cell blasts was studied next. Lck immunoprecipitates were prepared from restimulated T-cell blasts and were subjected to anin vitro kinase assay in which autophosphorylation of Lck was measured. In three independent experiments, a 2–14-fold increase in autophosphorylation was observed in the APB CD4+ T-cell blasts after restimulation with TSST-1 (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, no elevation in autophosphorylation was observed in the thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that the Lck kinase activity of APB CD4+T-cell blasts increases markedly upon restimulation with TSST-1, whereas no such increase is induced in thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts. Tyrosine kinase activity of src family kinases is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of two tyrosine residues (Tyr-394 and Tyr-505 in Lck) (20Amrein KE. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4247-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 21Marth J.D. Cooper J.A. King C.S. Ziegler S.F. Tinker D.A. Overell R.W. Krebs E.G. Perlmutter R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 22Veillette A. Fournel M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1455-1462PubMed Google Scholar). To determine why thymic CD4+T-cell blasts restimulated with TSST-1 showed only weak Lck kinase activity, the extent of Lck tyrosine phosphorylation was compared in thymic and APB CD4+ T-cell blasts. Lck was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of these T-cell blasts after restimulation with TSST-1 on an APC monolayer, and the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine Ab. Lck was highly tyrosine-phosphorylated in both thymic and APB CD4+ T-cell blasts when no restimulation was carried out. After restimulation, the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation was markedly reduced within 5 min in APB CD4+ T-cell blasts, whereas almost no change was observed in thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts (Fig. 1 C, upper panels). Lck expression of was similar in both types of T-cell blasts (Fig. 1 C, lower panels). Similar findings were observed 20 min after restimulation (data not shown). Up-regulation of the Lck kinase activity is associated with phosphorylation of Tyr-394 (the autophosphorylation site) and dephosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine (Tyr-505) (20Amrein KE. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4247-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 21Marth J.D. Cooper J.A. King C.S. Ziegler S.F. Tinker D.A. Overell R.W. Krebs E.G. Perlmutter R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 22Veillette A. Fournel M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1455-1462PubMed Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 1, B and C, suggests that TSST-1 restimulation induced dephosphorylation of phosphorylated Tyr-505 in APB CD4+ T-cell blasts but not in thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts. Phosphorylated Tyr-505 of Lck has been shown to bind to its own Src homology-2 domain, and it is postulated that this binding can cause the molecule to fold and thereby block kinase activity (23Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Grazini A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar, 24Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). When phosphorylated Tyr-505 is dephosphorylated, Lck “opens out” and recovers the capacity to interact with a tyrosine-phosphorylated Lck carboxyl-terminal peptide (LckP peptide) (15Sieh M. Bolen J.B. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Tyr-505 residue of Lck is the site at which dephosphorylation induced by restimulation with TSST-1 occurs in APB CD4+ T-cell blasts, binding of dephosphorylated Lck to LckP peptide was examined. Cell lysates prepared from T-cell blasts restimulated with TSST-1 on an APC monolayer were incubated with biotinylated LckP peptide. The precipitates were isolated with avidin-conjugated agarose beads and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-Lck Ab. As shown in Fig. 1 D (upper panels), the extent of precipitated Lck was minimal in the absence of TSST-1 restimulation, but restimulation in APB CD4+T-cell blasts significantly increased the binding of Lck. In contrast, the LckP peptide-bound Lck did not increase after restimulation and rather showed a slight decrease in thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts. No difference in expression of the Lck was detected between the two T-cell populations (Fig. 1 D, lower panels). These results show that the dephosphorylated Tyr-505 of Lck in TSST-1-induced APB CD4+ T-cell blasts is in the “open” configuration, whereas Lck of thymic blasts is in a “closed” form. Because the Tyr-505 site of Lck is a potential substrate for the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45 (25Mustelin T. Coggeshal K.M. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6302-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), CD45 may play a major role in the dephosphorylation of Lck in APB CD4+T-cell blasts after restimlulation with TSST-1. To determine how Lck dephosphorylation is suppressed in thymic T-cell blasts, the subcellular localization of CD45 and Lck was determined by confocal microscopy. T-cell blasts restimulated with TSST-1 on an APC monolayer were separated from the monolayer and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 Ab and biotinylated anti-Lck Ab followed by Texas red-conjugated avidin. If Lck (red) and CD45 (green) were present in close proximity, the appearance of yellow dots would be observed. As shown in Fig. 2, Lck was expressed in both the membrane and cytoplamic areas of unstimulated thymic and APB CD4+ T-cell blasts, whereas CD45 was expressed mainly in the membrane. No colocalization of Lck and CD45 was observed in these cells. After restimulation with TSST-1, the intensity of the yellow color increased in the membrane of the APB CD4+ T-cell blasts, predominantly on one side of the blast, indicating that Lck and CD45 had become colocalized in the plasma membrane region after restimulation with TSST-1. In contrast, no colocalization of these two molecules was induced by restimulation of thymic CD4+T-cell blasts. Although the distributions of Lck and CD45 are comparable with that of APB CD4+ T-cell blasts, double staining with anti-CD45 and anti-Lck clearly shows these molecules are present in discrete areas on the cell membrane. Recent studies have shown that sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich plasma membrane microdomains, termed membrane rafts, play an important role in TCR signal transduction. Raft aggregation promotes recruitment of signaling proteins such as Lck but excludes the tyrosine phosphatase CD45 (26Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8051) Google Scholar, 27Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Our data from confocal microscopy suggests that the physical interaction between CD45 and Lck in thymic T-cell blasts is much less than in APB T-cell blasts. To test whether membrane rafts play a role in the process of Lck activation, we next determined the localization of Lck and CD45 inside and outside of the raft fraction. Cell lysates prepared from T-cell blasts restimulated with TSST-1 on an APC monolayer were lysed in a buffer containing nonionic detergent, and the lysates were fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig.3 A, Lck was mostly present outside of rafts in unstimulated T-cell blasts. After restimulation with TSST-1, a significant increase of Lck in rafts was observed in APB CD4+ T-cell blasts. In contrast, no increase of Lck in membrane rafts was induced by restimulation of thymic CD4+T-cell blasts. This increase of Lck in the raft was more striking after a 70-min restimulation of APB T-cell blasts. Even at that point, no increase was observed in thymic T-cell blasts. Immunoprecipitation of Lck from the same fractionated lysates confirmed these results (Fig.3 A). In contrast to this accumulation of Lck in the raft, CD45 was present outside of the raft fraction throughout the restimulation in both types of T-cell blasts as previously reported (Fig. 3 C). Human thymic CD1a−CD4+ T cells are highly susceptible to anergy induction by superantigens, whereas APB CD4+ T cells are resistant, as shown in a previous study (2Imanishi K. Seo K. Kato H. Miyoshi-Akiyama T. Zhang R.H. Takahashi Y. Imai Y. Uchiyama T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 112-119PubMed Google Scholar) and in Table I. T cells are rendered anergic when they are stimulated through TCR in the absence of costimulatory signals such as the CD28 molecule (4Mueller D.L. Jenkins M.K. Shwartz R.H. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2617-2627PubMed Google Scholar). However, the absence of a costimulatory signal is not responsible for the high susceptibility of thymic CD1a−CD4+ T cells to TSST-1-induced anergy, because the percentage of CD28+ T cells among unstimulated thymic and APB CD4+ T cells was similar. We did not find any differences in surface phenotypes to explain the differences in susceptibility to anergy induction between unstimulated thymic and APB CD4+ T cells (Table I). In the present study, we examined signal transduction in thymic and APB CD4+ T-cell blasts before and after restimulation with TSST-1. The results strongly suggest the presence of a novel regulatory mechanism that controls an interaction between Lck and CD45. The activity of CD45 is regulated by several mechanisms including isoform specific regulation (28Leitenberg D. Boutin Y. Lu D.D. Bottomly K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, the level of CD45RO expression was similar in both thymic and APB CD4+ T-cell blasts (Table I), ruling out the possibility that isoform differences caused the impairment of CD45 function in thymic CD4+T-cell blasts. Instead, our results show a remarkable difference in the physical localization of CD45 and Lck after restimulation with TSST-1 in thymic CD4+ T-cell blasts. An analysis of the subcellular localization of CD45 and Lck in thymic and APB CD4+ T-cell blasts after restimulation with TSST-1 showed that Lck and CD45 were physically associated in the membrane region of APB CD4+ T-cell blasts but not thymic CD4+T-cell blasts (Fig. 2). Membrane-associated molecules are known to localize to a specifically designated area composed of discrete lipid microdomains (26Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8051) Google Scholar, 27Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Some but not all of the Lck localizes in sphingolipid-cholesterol rafts, whereas no association of CD45 with these rafts has been observed (27Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar,29Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that a synaptic structure is formed by dynamic relocalization of various molecules at the site of the interaction between T cells and APC (30Viola A. Schroeder S. Sakakibara Y. Lanzavecchia A. Science. 1999; 283: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 31Grakoui A. Bromley S.K. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Science. 1999; 285: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2529) Google Scholar, 32Monks C.R.F. Freiberg B.A. Kupfer H. Sciaky N. Kupfer A. Nature. 1998; 395: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar). The central zone of the synaptic structure formed between T cells and APC is rich in TCR, CD4, and CD28, whereas CD45 remains on the outside (31Grakoui A. Bromley S.K. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Science. 1999; 285: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2529) Google Scholar, 32Monks C.R.F. Freiberg B.A. Kupfer H. Sciaky N. Kupfer A. Nature. 1998; 395: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar). This discrete localization of CD45 and Lck indicates that there is a dynamic process involved in the interaction between these two molecules. A potential model is that repartitioning of Lck from the outside to the inside of sphingolipid-cholesterol rafts is regulated by interaction with CD45. In this view, Lck, which resided outside of the raft, gets dephosphorylated after stimulation and localizes in the raft. With thymic T-cell blasts, the interaction between CD45 and Lck is blocked, and thus this translocation into the raft is blocked (Fig.4, MODEL 1). Alternatively, although CD45 is not within the raft, it only interacts with Lck within the raft. In thymic T-cell blasts, Lck localization into rafts is blocked, and as a result, its interaction with CD45 is impaired (Fig.4, MODEL 2). We are currently testing these hypotheses. Taken together, these results suggest the presence of a novel regulatory mechanism that controls localization of CD45 and Lck in activated T cells. Most importantly, this regulation may play a critical role in the maintenance of the anergic state of human thymic CD1a−CD4+ T cells induced by superantigens. We are grateful to Dr. Takamitsu Fujimaki (University of Teikyo, Japan) for helpful discussion during the experiments, Dr. Pandlakis Koni (Medical College of Georgia) for critical reading of the manuscript, and to Dr. Yasuhiro Koga (Tokai University, Kanagawa, Japan) for providing the anti-Lck antibody."

Here, we used gel shift assays and footprinting experiments to analyze the interaction between I-SceI and its target. I-SceI was found to bind to its substrate in monomeric form. Footprinting using DNase I, hydroxyl radical, phenanthroline copper complexes, UV/DH-MePyPs photosensitizer, and base-modifying reagents revealed the asymmetric nature of the interaction and provided a first glimpse into the architecture of the complex. The protein interacts in the minor and major grooves and distorts DNA at three distinct sites: one at the intron insertion site and the other two, respectively, downstream (−8, −9) and upstream (+9, +10) from this site. The protein appears to stabilize the DNA curved around it by bridging the minor groove on one face of the helix. The scissile phosphates would lie on the outside of the bend, facing in the same direction relative to the DNA helical axis, as expected for an endonuclease that generates 3′ overhangs. An internally consistent model is proposed in which the protein would take advantage of the concerted flexibility of the DNA sequence to induce a synergistic binding/kinking process, resulting in the correct positioning of the enzyme active site.

This family of enzymes mediates the propagation of the intron by cutting intronless genes at the site of intron insertion (reviewed in Ref. 3Mueller J.E. Bryk M. Loizos N. Belfort M. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 111-143Google Scholar). Like restriction enzymes, homing endonucleases cleave double-stranded DNA with high specificity in the presence of divalent metal ions. However, they differ from restriction endonucleases in their recognition properties and structures, as well as in their genomic location (4Belfort M. Roberts R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3379-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In particular, whereas restriction enzymes have short recognition sequences (3–8 bp),1 homing endonucleases, despite their small size, recognize long DNA sequences (12–40 bp). They have been classified into four families on the basis of both their sequence motifs and DNA cleavage mechanism (3Mueller J.E. Bryk M. Loizos N. Belfort M. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 111-143Google Scholar). The protein I-SceI is a member of the largest class of homing enzymes (more than 130 proteins), characterized by the presence of either one or two conserved 12 amino acid residue sequence motifs (LAGLI-DADG motifs). Most of these proteins, like I-SceI, carry the motif in duplicate and are endonucleases. I-SceI has been purified as a monomeric globular protein of 235 amino acids (5Montheilet C. Perrin A. Thierry A. Colleaux L. Dujon B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Its endonuclease activity requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ but not Co2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, or Zn2+ to cleave DNA within its recognition sequence and leaves a 4-bp overhang presenting a 3′-hydroxyl terminus (5Montheilet C. Perrin A. Thierry A. Colleaux L. Dujon B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 6Colleaux L. D'Auriol L. Galibert F. Dujon B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6022-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The enzyme displays a low turnover, probably because of its strong affinity for one of the products of the cleavage reaction (7Perrin A. Buckle M. Dujon B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2939-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).The interaction of homing endonucleases with their substrates raises an interesting question common to all the gene-regulatory proteins, namely: how can a small protein specifically recognize and modify a long DNA sequence? Understanding the molecular basis of such a mechanism is essential for elucidating many aspects of cellular control and is a prerequisite in any rational drug design program. It is clearly established that local and global DNA structural features that are highly sequence-dependent, play a primary role in the dynamics of protein-DNA recognition (8Steitz T.A. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 205-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Sequence recognition would arise from the inherent sequence-dependent ability to adopt the conformation required for protein binding in the transient, biologically active complex. In an attempt to reveal intrinsic helical properties of the I-SceI nucleic acid target, we used this sequence as substrate in earlier studies analyzing the mechanisms of DNA chemical reactions and photosensitization processes (9Schaeffer F. Rimsky S. Spassky A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 523-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Andreu Guillo L. Blais J. Vigny P. Spassky A. Photochem.

We found evidence that the conformation of the helix deviates from the ideal B-form duplex along two segments of three and five base pairs located at a distance of approximately one helical turn, respectively, upstream and downtream from the site of junction of the two exons (9Schaeffer F. Rimsky S. Spassky A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 523-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the present study, we first performed DNase I footprinting and gel retardation assays to identify the complex formed between I-SceI and its target in the absence of a divalent metal ion. We then used chemical probing agents to characterize the conformation of DNA in the complex. I-SceI protein-DNA complex was thus submitted to the nucleolytic attack of the cuprous complexes of 1,10-phenanthroline (OP2Cu+ and Phe-OP2Cu+), which results from the abstraction of C-1′ hydrogen atom by a tetrahedral copper-oxo species bound within the minor groove (13Sigman D.S.

Blais J. Vigny P. Spassky A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 61: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We also employed chemical modification agents of base and sugar residues (for a review, see Ref. 16Nielsen P.E. J. Mol. Recogn. 1990; 3: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), which carboxylates purines at the N-7 atom, potassium permanganate (KMnO4), which oxidizes pyrimidine residues at the C5=C6double bond, dimethyl sulfate (DMS), which primarily methylates the N-7 of guanine residues and free hydroxyl radical, generated by Fe-EDTA reduction of hydrogen peroxide, which abstracts C-4′ hydrogen atoms from deoxyriboses of the DNA backbone. In the scheme that arises from present experiments, I-SceI appears to stabilize, in monomeric form, a constrained helical structure in which the minor groove is widened at the cleavage sites. The results are discussed in relation to previous reports on other endonucleases of the same family.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESI-SceI Protein and DNA SubstratesI-SceI was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, aliquoted at 10 units/μl in phosphate buffer in the presence of 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and conserved in 50% glycerol at −20 °C. Protein concentration was determined from the optical density of the bands on a Phast System minigel (12.5% acrylamide/5.5% SDS), using bovine serum albumin as internal standard (not shown). The solution used in the present study had a concentration of 0.72 × 10−12 mole per enzymatic unit.The 98-bp EcoRI-HindIII DNA fragment including the I-SceI recognition sequence (sequence shown in Fig.1A) was excised from its pUC19 vector supplied by B. Dujon (6Colleaux L. D'Auriol L. Galibert F. Dujon B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6022-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and was purified by electrophoresis on a 15% preparative native polyacrylamide gel as described (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1123-1128Google Scholar). Concentration was measured by UV absorbance. The fragment was stored in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA (TE). For only 5′ end-labeling, pUC19 plasmid vector was first digested with either the restriction enzymeEcoRI or HindIII, dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, 5′ end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and then digested with the second restriction enzyme before purification by 20% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Synthetic oligonucleotides used to form the 54- and 37-bp fragments (Fig. 1, B and C), were purchased from Genset (France). Purification, labeling, and annealing were carried out as previously described (12Spassky A. Angelov D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6571-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Gel Shift Analysis of I-SceI/DNA InteractionsThe conditions were derived from those described previously (17Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar,18Garner M.M. Revzin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3037-3060Crossref Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). I-SceI (10−9 to 10−7m) and 5′ 32P-labeled DNA (either 98, 54, or 37 bp DNA fragments) (10−10 to 10−8m) were preincubated separately for 2 min at 4 °C in the binding buffer (final concentration: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol and 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) and then mixed and incubated for 10 min at 20 °C. A 0.1 volume of loading buffer (50% glycerol/0.02% xylene cyanol) was added. 8–12% polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) were prerun in 1× TBE (9 mm Tris-HCl, 8.8 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) for 2 h at 120 V. Samples were loaded at 50 V, and the gels were run at 120 V at 4 °C. Gels were dried and placed in phosphorimager cassettes. Screens were exposed for several hours and scanned using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager with Image Quant software. The fraction of bound (free) DNA in each lane was calculated by dividing the area of bound (free) bands by the total area of bound and free bands. Each binding assay was performed in triplicate.Quantification of the Apparent Equilibrium Dissociation ConstantThe apparent equilibrium dissociation constant was derived from the Scatchard plot of the binding data in which the ratio of bound to free DNA concentration was plotted against bound DNA concentration using the Kaleidograph (Synergy software). The reciprocal of the negative slope of the linear plot gives the value of the apparentK d .DNA-Protein StoichiometryThe 5′ end-labeled DNA fragment (Fig. 1B,54bp) (8 × 10−10m) and I-SceI protein (0.01 units/μl) were incubated as described above, before loading onto a set of 8, 10, 12, and 15% polyacrylamide gels, alongside 10 μg of nondenatured protein molecular size standards (Sigma). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. The relative mobility of each species including free DNA fragment (Rf) was calculated by dividing the distance of the corresponding band by that of the bromphenol blue tracking dye in the same lane. For each species, the plot of 100[log (100Rf)] against gel concentration was constructed. The negative slope or retardation coefficient (−K r) was then plotted as a function of the molecular mass for each protein standard, and this calibration line was used to determine the apparent molecular mass of the free DNA fragment and that of the protein I-SceI/DNA complex. The difference between these two values divided by the molecular mass of a protein monomer gives the number of protein monomers bound to the DNA (n).Complex Probing Using DNA Cleavage ReagentsUniquely 5′ end-labeled DNA fragments (Fig. 1, A,B, or C) were digested directly or after incubation with the I-SceI protein as described above. In each case, digestion was carried out under conditions such that the DNA molecule was broken only once.DNase I FootprintingDNase I footprinting was done essentially as previously described (51Spassky A. Busby S. Buc H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Digestion was carried out at 23 °C using DNase I at a final concentration of 0.025 μg/ml for 15 or 45 s, depending on whether the DNA was free or I-SceI-bound.Hydroxyl Radical FootprintingA stock solution of iron(II)-EDTA was prepared immediately before use by mixing equal volumes of freshly prepared 0.4 mm(NH4)2Fe(SO4)2,6H2O and 0.8 mm EDTA. The footprinting reaction was initiated by placing iron(II)-EDTA solution (3 μl), 0.6% hydrogen peroxide (3 μl), and 20 mm sodium ascorbate (3 μl) on the inner wall of the 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing 21 μl of free or I-SceI-bound DNA, allowing the reagents to mix and then adding the cutting reagent to the sample solution. The reaction was allowed to run for 30 s and quenched by adding 3 μl of 1m thiourea.Phenanthroline Copper Complex FootprintingOrthophenanthroline-cuprous complex (OP2Cu+ or 5 Phe OP2Cu+) footprinting was carried out as previously described (29Spassky A. Sigman D.S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8050-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 30Thederahn T. Kuwabara M.D. Spassky A. Sigman D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One μl of a solution freshly prepared by diluting an ethanolic solution of 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mm) and an aqueous cupric sulfate solution (0.23 mm) was added to 10 μl of the appropriate free or I-SceI-bound DNA sample. Cleavage was initiated by the addition of 1 μl of 58 mm MPA (final concentration, 5.8 mm), and the mixture was incubated at 23 °C for either 30 s for OP2Cu+ or 2 min for 5 Phe OP2Cu+. Cleavage was quenched by the addition of 1 μl of 28 mm 2,9-dimethyl-orthophenanthroline (final concentration, 2.8 mm).Analysis of Cleaved FragmentsSpecific quenching of the footprinting reagent was followed by addition of a general stop solution to a final concentration of 1 mm EDTA, 0.3m sodium acetate, and 10 μg/ml tRNA. After phenol extraction, samples were ethanol-precipitated and lyophilized. The dried samples were resuspended in 10 μl of gel loading buffer and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis in 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide containing 7 m urea. After electrophoresis, gels were dried on Whatman 3MM paper and exposed to x-ray film (X-OMAT) for documentation or to storage out of phosphor screens for quantification.Complex Probing Using UVA DHMePyPs PhotosensitizationUVA (365 nm) irradiation in the presence of DHMePyPs of the I-SceI protein-bound DNA fragment (98 bp) was performed exactly as previously described for free DNA (10Andreu Guillo L. Blais J. Vigny P. Spassky A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 61: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). One μl of an ethanolic psoralen solution (10−5m) was added to 19 μl of the appropriate labeled DNA sample in binding buffer. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, sample-containing droplets were irradiated on ice at 365 nm using an HPW 125 Philips mercury lamp at a fluence of 25 J/m2/s, as determined by a VLX 365 radiometer. After irradiation, psoralen and protein were extracted with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol/phenol followed by G50-Sephadex column chromatography. The DNA was then ethanol-precipitated and treated as above.Complex Probing Using Nucleobase Modifications (52McCarthy J.G. Williams L.D. Rich A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6071-6081Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)Whereas quite unreactive toward double-stranded adenine and guanine residues, diethyl pyrocarbonate can carbethoxylate the N-7 atom of purines of distorted structures, with a strong preference for adenines, thus destabilizing the imidazole ring and creating a piperidine-sensitive site. Similarly, because potassium permanganate oxidizes the C5=C6 double bond of pyrimidines (T≫C) from above or below the plane of the base, these residues are susceptible to attack by KMnO4 only if the stacking interaction is disrupted.Thymidines Using Potassium Permanganate (KMnO4)One microliter of freshly prepared 0.1m KMnO4 was added to 5 μl of the appropriate labeled DNA sample. The reaction was stopped after 4 min at 23 °C by addition of 2 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. After phenol extraction, samples were ethanol-precipitated, washed and dried.Adenines Using Diethyl Pyrocarbonate (DEPC)One microliter of freshly prepared 3% DEPC was added to 10 μl of the appropriate labeled DNA sample. The reaction mixture was incubated for various time (30 s; 2.5 and 10 min.) at 30 °C and then stopped by addition of 10 μl of 50 mm imidazole. After phenol extraction, samples were ethanol-precipitated, washed, and dried.Guanines Using DimethylsulfateThe DNA fragment (Fig. 1), uniquely 5′ 32P-end-labeled on the top or on the bottom strand, was methylated either directly or after incubation with I-SceI protein (see above), by adding dimethyl sulfate directly to the reaction mixture. The concentration of methylating agent, reaction temperature, and incubation time were determined so as to obtain in each case 1 N-7-MeG lesion per strand.Processing of Modified DNAThe pellets of modified DNA samples were resuspended in 100 μl of 1 m piperidine at 95 °C for 30 min. Piperidine was removed by extensive lyophilization. The dried samples were resuspended in 10 μl of gel loading buffer (as described in ref. 50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1123-1128Google Scholar) and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis in 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide containing 7 murea. After electrophoresis, gels were dried on Whatman 3MM paper and exposed to x-ray film (X-OMAT) for documentation or to storage out of phosphor screens for quantification.Quantification of ResultsThe autoradiograms were scanned by using a PhosphorImager and Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics). Measurements and normalization were carried out exactly as previously described (12Spassky A. Angelov D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6571-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn the cellular context, the endonuclease I-SceI discriminates its target site among ∼107 bp (40Thierry A. Perrin A. Boyer J. Fairhead C. Dujon B. Frey B. Schmidt G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 189-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Present results establish that, as with other proteins of the same family, the absence of divalent metal ions eliminates cleavage but not sequence-specific DNA binding. Consistent with the general tendency of the two-motif LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases (4Belfort M. Roberts R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3379-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), I-SceI was found to bind to its substrate in monomeric form. Furthermore, the difference in the length of the downstream and upstream exonic sequences involved in protein-DNA binding as well as the position of the footprinting protection and cleavage maxima clearly reveal that the downstream part of the recognition sequence is primarily involved in I-SceI binding. Experimental results provide also the evidence that I-SceI binding is accompanied by DNA distortion. In the model of the complex that arises from the present findings (summarized in Fig. 10 and 11), the binding of the protein appears to distort its bound substrate to widen the minor groove at the cleavage site and make the scissile phosphates accessible to the enzyme active site. A sequential binding-kinking model is suggested in which the first step of the protein binding would be facilitated by the helical features of the sequence located at one helical turn downstream from the intron insertion site. The high tendency of this region to unwind is apparent from the OP2Cu+hypersensitivity at positions 10 to 15 and from the strikingly high sensitivity of position G7 to DMS methylation (Fig. 8), observed to characterize guanines positioned in open DNA regions (41). This intrinsic unwinding must facilitate protein binding deep in the minor groove resulting in kinking the double helix at the base step A9A10, 5′ to the protein side chain minor groove intercalation (42Werner M.H. Gronenborn A.M. Clore M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and easily propagating helical distortion. The induced helical distortion would position the sugar-phosphate backbone of residues 2 and 5 on the top strand and −1 to +3 on the bottom strand in register to be contacted by the protein from the outside of the minor groove. This would result in the induction of a new constraint that deforms the helical area encompassing the cleavage sites. Note that the experiments using the variant substrate with the substitution G/C to A/T at +7 support this direct relationship. The protein would therefore be positioned closer to the first steps of the next minor groove opening on the same side of the helix, i.e. positions −5, −6 on the top strand and −7 on the bottom strand giving rise in turn to an upstream distortion identified by the Phe-OPCu hypersensitivity at positions −8, −9, and the unstacking of the bases A−6 and T−7. Thus, by bridging the minor groove opening on the same face of the helix, the protein would induce DNA to curve around it, the major groove being directly accessible to the binding surfaces of the protein on either side of the center of the homing site. The protein would thus stabilize the natural tendency of the helix to bend, predicted by a theoretical calculation using the program proposed by De Santiset al. (43De Santis P. Palleschi A. Savino M. Scipion A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9269-9273Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) according to which the DNA primary sequence would induce a global curvature to the helix with a maximum distortion angle at the step A4G5. 2F.

Nature. 1998; 394: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), it appears that these relatively small homing endonucleases utilize the same principle to recognize and cleave their long DNA targets. They form extended folds that allow them to form long interfaces across lengthy DNA homing sites and display preformed binding motifs, consisting of antiparallel β-ribbons, making extended contacts with the DNA. However, the different conserved motifs that characterize each family give each of them a specific interface structure. In particular, the proteins of the LAGLIDADG family share a domain fold characterized by the topology αββαββα. This gives rise to an unusual β-ribbon helical interface whose architecture displays an extensive curvature complementary to the DNA major groove in the cleavage sites region and further facilitates the recognition of extended DNA sequences (49Philipps S.E.V.

Hart F.D. Nicholls A. Caffrey M. James D.C. Sturrock R.D. Lancet. 1973; 1: 904-907Abstract PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar, 2Schlosstein L. Terasaki P.I. Bluestone R. Pearson C.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1973; 288: 704-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Despite intensive research over the last decade, the pathogenic mechanism of the association is still unknown (3López de Castro J.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Colbert R.A. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 224-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). One of the most favored models for disease association postulates the binding to HLA-B27 of autoantigenic peptides, thus mimicking foreign antigens (5Benjamin R. Parham P. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 137-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is also supported by a recent finding for a specific T-cell reactivity to a self-peptide for AS patients (6Fiorillo M.T. Maragno M. Butler R. Dupuis M.L. Sorrentino R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, it cannot account for the differential susceptibility to several HLA-B27 alleles even though they select very similar peptide repertoires (7Allen R.L. Bowness P. McMichael A. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recent studies on transgenic mice seem to contradict the arthritogenic hypothesis. Mice lacking β2m and thus a functional antigen presentation pathway can develop a spontaneous inflammatory arthritis (8Khare S.D. Luthra H.S. David C.S. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Moreover, this is also observed in the absence of MHC class II genes (9Khare S.D. Bull M.J. Hanson J. Luthra H.S. David C.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 101-106PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that B27-derived peptides might not be responsible for the disease association. This evidence has led to an increased number of alternative hypotheses that have been presented over the last few years (4Colbert R.A. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 224-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10Khan M.A. J. Rheumatol. 2000; 27: 1110-1114PubMed Google Scholar). The B pocket of the HLA-B27 protein is considered to be the domain with the most influence on peptide selection. HLA-B27 shows a high specificity for Arg (position 2 of the peptide) in the B pocket of the binding site (11Colbert R.A. Rowland-Jones S.L. McMichael A.J. Frelinger J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6879-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition to the role played by the B pocket in peptide selection, this subsite is also believed to play a predominant role in protein misfolding. Mear et al. (12Mear J.P. Schreiber K.L. Munz C. Zhu X. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.G. Rowland-Jones S.L. Colbert R.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6665-6670PubMed Google Scholar) recently showed that the replacement of the HLA-B27 B pocket with one from HLA-A2 could totally impair the misfolding phenotype of the protein. They proposed that misfolding and its consequences are a basis for susceptibility to spondyloarthropathies rather than allele-specific peptide presentation. The misfolding behavior of the protein could cause endoplasmic reticulum stress responses (13Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3584) Google Scholar, 14Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) and therefore influence intracellular signaling pathways. HLA-B27 presents specific features because of a free Cys-67 at the top of the B pocket. This free Cys-67 has been shown to be highly chemically reactive (15Weiss G.A. Valentekovich R.J. Collins E.J. Garboczi D.N. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10945-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), probably because of polarization from a neighboring Lys-70 (16Whelan M.A. Archer J.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 3278-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has also been hypothesized that oxidative modification of this residue may play a role in B27-related disease (17Gao X.M. Wordsworth P. McMichael A.J. Kyaw M.M. Seifert M. Rees D. Dougan G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1443-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recently Allen et al.(18Allen R.L. O'Callaghan C.A. McMichael A.J. Bowness P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5045-5048PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a B*2705 heavy chain (HC) homodimer can form and be presented at the cell surface, which is dependent on Cys-67. The recognition of the HLA-B*2705 α1 helix by the ME1 mAb is impaired by the formation of homodimers, consistent with a partial unwinding of the helix that could be caused by a disulfide bonding. The presentation of such a non-classical homodimer on the cell surface could induce altered T-cell responses, while potentially mimicking a MHC class II binding site, and lead to recognition by CD4 lymphocytes and autoimmunity. Peptides longer than 9 amino acids characteristic of MHC class II ligands have already been eluted from B27, which supports this theory (19Urban R.G. Chicz R.M. Lane W.S. Strominger J.L. Rehm A. Kenter M.J. UytdeHaag F.G. Ploegh H. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1534-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, it is still unknown which amino acids of the B pocket controls the peculiar misfolding properties of HLA-B*2705. Therefore, we engineered a series of four pocket B mutants of the B*2705 HC and investigated peptide binding properties as well as thermal unfolding of the corresponding complexes with the three peptides. Circular dichroism-monitored thermal unfolding, fluorescence polarization spectroscopy, and size exclusion chromatography suggest that the thermodynamic stability of the B*2705 heavy chain is significantly decreased upon mutation of any of the pocket B residues. Cys-67 seems to play a major role in promoting unfolding to high molecular weight species while not affecting peptide binding properties. The heavy chain was cloned into pET-24b plasmid (Novagen) using the same protocol as described previously (20Dedier S. Reinelt S. Reitinger T. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27055-27061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for HLA-B*2705. Briefly, the gene was amplified by PCR starting from pQE-30 (Qiagen) containing the A*0201 heavy chain. 2D. Rognan and S. Krebs, unpublished results. The same primers that were used for B*2705 were used to introduce the two restriction sites NdeI and XhoI flanking the gene. After restriction, the fragment was ligated into the expression plasmid, which was then transformed into Escherichia coliDH5α strain for selection. All the mutations of HLA-B*2705 heavy chain were introduced by the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) because it required only the change of a maximum of three neighboring base pairs. For this purpose, we amplified the pET-24b plasmid (Novagen) containing the B*2705 wild-type heavy chain with PCR. The corresponding primer pairs (forward and reverse) used for the four reactions are listed in TableI. The PCR products were then digested with DpnI and transformed into E. coli XL2-Blue strain (Stratagene) for selection. The sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing (ABI 310 PRISM, Perkin Elmer).Table IPrimers used for the mutagenesis of HLA-B*2705 or HLA-A*0201MutationSenseSequenceT24V HLA-B*2705Forward5′-GCCCCGCTTCATCGTCGTGGGCTACGTGG-3′Reverse5′-CCACGTAGCCACGACGATGAAGCGGGGC-3′E45M HLA-B*2705Forward5′-GCGAGTCCGAGAATGGAGCCGCGGGCG-3′Reverse5′-CGCCCGCGGCTCCATTCTCGGACTCGC-3′C67S HLA-B*2705Forward5′-GGGAGACACAGATCTCCAAGGCCAAG-3′Reverse5′-CTTGGCCTTGGAGATCTGTGTCTCCC-3′Y99F HLA-B*2705Forward5′-CCCTCCAGAATATGTTTGGCTGCGACGTGG-3′Reverse5′-CCACGTCGCAGCCAAACATATTCTGGAGGG-3′V67C HLA-A*0201Forward5′-CGGGGAGACACGGAAATGCAAGGCCCACTCACAG-3′Reverse5′-CTGTGAGTGGGCCTTGCATTTCCGTGTCTCCCCG-3′ Open table in a new tab This mutation was introduced by the same method using the pET-24b-A0201 plasmid as template.

The expression of the HLA-B*2705 or HLA-A*0201 heavy chains and of the relative mutants were performed in E. coli BL21-Codonplus(DE3)-RIL strain (Stratagene). The proteins were purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate-agarose column (Qiagen) as previously described (20Dedier S. Reinelt S. Reitinger T. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27055-27061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β2-microglobulin was expressed and purified using the protocol described in the same report. Peptides were obtained by automated solid-phase peptide synthesis on an automated multiple peptide synthesizer (Syro Multi-Syn-Tech, Bochum, Germany) using the standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)-methoxycarbonyl) protecting strategy. For synthesis of the fluorescein-labeled peptide GRAFVTIK*K (* is the fluorescein label), a lysine with a Dde-protected side-chain was inserted at position 8. After synthesis and selective deprotection, Lys-8 was coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate. Complete deprotection and cleavage from the resin was achieved by trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were analyzed and purified by mass spectrometry and HPLC as previously described (20Dedier S. Reinelt S. Reitinger T. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27055-27061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thermal denaturation CD experiments were performed as previously described (20Dedier S. Reinelt S. Reitinger T. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27055-27061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the HLA-B*2705/peptide complex was refolded upon dialysis of 10 ml of reconstitution buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 mm 2,2′-dithiodiethanol, pH 8.0) containing HLA-B*2705 HC (10 μm), β2m (20 μm), peptide (100 μm), and urea (6 m) against 1 liter of reconstitution buffer. After purification and concentration, the complex was used immediately for denaturation experiments. The stability of the complex was examined by thermal denaturation, unfolding was monitored by CD spectroscopy at a wavelength of 218 nm. The temperature was raised from 20 to 85 °C at a rate of 40 °C/h. The concentration of the complex was held constant at 1 μm. The melting points were determined following a standard protocol for thermal denaturation experiments (21Pace N.C. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach, 2nd edition. IRL Press, Oxford Univ. Press, 1997: 299-321Google Scholar). The melting points were averaged from at least two independent refolding experiments. Experimental error was estimated to be lower than 1 °C. The HLA-B*2705/peptide complex was refolded by dilution of HC (1 μm), β2m (2 μm), labeled peptide (8 nm), and various amounts of competitor (typically 1 nm to 100 μm) into 1 ml of dilution buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmCHAPS, 0.3 mm 2,2′-dithiodiethanol, pH 8.0). After 36 h of incubation at room temperature, complex formation was confirmed according to a size exclusion HPLC assay (22Ottenhoff T.H. Geluk A. Toebes M. Benckhuijsen W.E. van Meijgaarden K.E. Drijfhout J.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The ratio between bound and unbound labeled ligand was determined using fluorescence polarization. Polarization values were measured on a Polarion fluorescence-polarization system (Tecan, Austria) using 200 μl of sample in a 96-well black quartz microtiter plate (Hellma, Germany). The number of flashes was set to 200, total intensity was held at 65,000 rfu. Concentrations at half-maximal inhibition (IC50values) were obtained by fitting polarization values versustotal concentration of competitor to a dose-response model. The IC50 values were averaged from three independent experiments. Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated in TBS containing 20 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. Experiments were performed at 25 °C and concentrations were held at 1 μm. 100 μl of sample was loaded onto the column and eluted at 0.7 ml/min in TBS. Elution profiles of the proteins were monitored by UV-absorbance at 280 and 220 nm. Molecular weight was calculated by comparison of the elution retention times of MHC samples to those of marker proteins (data not shown). Details of these experiments will be described elsewhere. 3S. Dédier, T. Reinelt, S. Rion, G. Folkers, and D. Rognan, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, the complexes were refolded following the dialysis protocol previously described (20Dedier S. Reinelt S. Reitinger T. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27055-27061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of 1 ml of protein-containing buffer against 100 ml buffer. We used the fluorescent-labeled peptide GRAFVTIK*K as ligand. FPLC chromatography was performed for purification, without a prior concentration step. After addition of a large excess of unlabeled competitor, the time course of peptide dissociation from the complex was monitored at 26 °C. All measurements were duplicates of independent experiments. To determine the stabilizing properties of B pocket amino acids, we first mutated separately the following four residues of the HLA-B*2705 HC: Thr-24 to Val, Glu-45 to Met, Tyr-99 to Phe, and Cys-67 to Ser. T24V and Y99F changes were chosen to be as conservative as possible. Met-45 is present in the HLA-A*0201 B pocket, which when substituting the wild-type B*2705 B pocket impairs misfolding of this allele (12Mear J.P. Schreiber K.L. Munz C. Zhu X. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.G. Rowland-Jones S.L. Colbert R.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6665-6670PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, position 45 is known to control allele-specific peptide binding (23Buxton S.E. Benjamin R.J. Clayberger C. Parham P. Krensky A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Last, the C67S mutation was chosen to be as conservative as possible while removing the free Cys. For refolding HC-β2m-peptide heterotrimers, we used a peptide from the B27-restricted T cell epitope from the HIV1 gp120 protein GRAFVTIGK (K9) (24Jardetzky T.S. Lane W.S. Robinson R.A. Madden D.R. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) and two analogs (GRAFVTIGI or I9 and GRAFVTIGS or S9). The mutant-peptide complexes were assembled by a refolding assay starting from the recombinant proteins and were analyzed for their thermal stability by means of CD spectroscopy. The wild-type HLA-B*2705/peptide complexes represent a wide range of thermal stabilities, with values varying from a high melting point of unfolding Tm (60.1 °C for K9), through medium (53.3 °C for I9) and to low values (43.4 °C for S9) (20Dedier S. Reinelt S. Reitinger T. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27055-27061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each mutation appeared to be prejudicial to the thermal stability of the mutant-peptide complex with a detrimental effect ranging from about −2.8 to −22.6 °C in comparison to the wild-type complexes (Fig.1). The strongest effects were observed for I9 and K9 complexes for which the destabilization values ranged from −8.1 °C to a maximum of −22.6 °C. The T24V or E45M mutations seemed to be extremely detrimental for the complexes loaded with K9 (16.1 to 22.6 °C destabilization) and less so for the complexes with I9 peptide (around −12 °C). Interestingly, the E45M mutant could still be refolded in the presence of Arg-2-containing peptides. The Y99F and C67S mutations destabilized more the complexes with I9 (−18.1 and −12.4 °C, respectively) than with K9 (−11.7 and −8.1). The smallest destabilization was observed for the complexes with S9. For all mutant/S9 complexes, only a modest destabilization ranging from 3–6 °C could be observed. The profile of thermal denaturation curves of HLA B*2705/peptide complexes was strongly dependent on pH value but independent of the nature of the complexed peptide. The complex of HLA-B*2705 with a reference peptide (I9; Ref. 20Dedier S. Reinelt S. Reitinger T. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27055-27061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was therefore denaturated under mild alkaline, neutral, and mild acidic conditions (Fig. 2). Changes of the second transition are more easily monitored if the first transition is below 60 °C; therefore, the I9 peptide was chosen as ligand. Under mild alkaline conditions (pH 8.3) a single transition was observed, which led to partial unfolding, reflected by the loss of only a third of the original CD signal (Fig. 2 A). Under neutral conditions, an additional step of unfolding was evident that resulted in an almost complete unfolding. Interestingly, the first transition, which is clearly peptide-dependent (data not shown), was unaffected by a pH modification; neither midpoint of transition nor degree of unfolding was changed. The novel intermediate state can be destabilized by lowering the pH to mild acidic conditions (pH 6.4) where both transitions seem to be merged (Fig. 2 A). Only a single unfolding step was apparent with an almost complete degree of unfolding that was observed under neutral conditions. The observation of the strong influence of pH on unfolding raised the question of whether this effect is common to other HLA alleles or if it is a specific property of the B*2705 subtype. Thus, we investigated the unfolding of HLA-A*0201, an allele for which no misfolding has been described (12Mear J.P. Schreiber K.L. Munz C. Zhu X. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.G. Rowland-Jones S.L. Colbert R.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6665-6670PubMed Google Scholar). The thermal denaturation curves of HLA-A*0201 proteins complexed with the natural epitope ILMEHIHKL (25Rammensee H. Bachmann J. Emmerich N.P. Bachor O.A. Stevanovic S. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar) are presented in Fig.2 B. Under neutral conditions (pH 7.3) unfolding occurred in a single step with the degree of unfolding (∼65%) significantly decreased compared with that observed for the reference HLA-B*2705/peptide complex under acidic conditions (∼85%). Moreover, for HLA-A*0201, an increase of pH induced a two-step unfolding process. But in contrast to HLA B*2705, the second step led to only minor additional unfolding of the complex with a total degree of unfolding of ∼33%. For HLA-B*2705, the intermediate state could be stabilized by increasing the pH. At pH 9.4, the second transition was still observed but was shifted toward a higher Tm value. Among the amino acids differing between HLA-B*2705 and HLA-A*0201 HC, Cys-67 was thought to have a major influence on the physiological properties of HLA-B*2705. We hypothesized that the observed differences in unfolding between HLA-B*2705 and HLA-A*0201 might be related to this unpaired cysteine. Thus, we engineered two HLA mutants for which a single point mutation had been introduced (C67S HLA-B*2705, V67C HLA-A*0201). As anticipated, these mutations induced a dramatic change in the unfolding process of the related HLA-peptide complexes. HLA-B*2705 C67S complexed with the I9 peptide now showed a single transition under neutral conditions (pH 7.3) resulting in about 65% unfolding (Fig. 2 C). As for the HLA-B*2705 WT complex, an increase of pH value led to a two-step unfolding process, but similar to the HLA-A*0201 WT complex, with only a minor contribution by the second step toward the final degree of unfolding of ∼40%. No completed unfolding similar to that observed for the wild-type B*2705 HC (Fig. 2 A) could be recorded for the C67S HC. The unfolding of HLA-A*0201 V67C complexes under neutral conditions seemed to be unaffected by the mutation (Fig. 2 D). However Cys-67 had a strong influence on the second unfolding step under alkaline conditions. The final degree of unfolding was significantly increased (to ∼50%) at pH 8.4 and 9.4 compared with the HLA-A*0201 WT complex (∼30%), thus shifting toward the unfolding characteristics of HLA-B*2705 WT complexes. To gain further insight into the consequences of B*2705 unfolding, we characterized B*2705 WT and C67S folding intermediates. HLA-B*2705 WT and HLA-B*2705 C67S complexes were subjected to thermal denaturation under mild alkaline conditions (pH 8.0) to obtain the different unfolded states observed by CD spectroscopy and then subjected to SEC and native gel electrophoresis. Under native conditions, both the WT and the mutant HLA-I9 peptide complexes had identical elution times, indicating that both heavy chains form similarly folded complexes (data not shown). After heating to 73 °C, a difference between WT and mutant can again be observed (Fig.3). For the WT protein, a peak at 11.1 min (corresponding to a mass of >500 kDa) reflects formation of high molecular mass aggregates. No peak corresponding to the heterotrimer, peptide-free B*2705 or HC could be detected and only a small β2m peak was observed. For the C67S complex, aggregation also takes place, but the aggregates formed have a significant lower apparent molecular mass (∼100 kDa). The peak at 20.8 min corresponds to 39 kDa, representing either native complex or peptide-free HC-β2m complex. Upon denaturation to 95 °C, precipitation occurred for the WT and mutant proteins, and only minor peaks indicating the native or peptide-free complex and β2m were observed. No peak corresponding to the recently described B*2705 HC dimer (18Allen R.L. O'Callaghan C.A. McMichael A.J. Bowness P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5045-5048PubMed Google Scholar) could be identified in our experiments. Analysis of thermal unfolding by native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed these observations (data not shown). To determine whether destabilization of B*2705-peptide complexes upon C67S mutation was correlated with peptide binding affinity, we measured the affinity of a series of four related peptides (Table II) to either the WT or C67S B*2705 mutant by a fluorescence polarization-based assay using a fluorescein-labeled reference peptide (GRAFVTIK*K). Analysis of binding data revealed no significant difference in binding between the WT and mutant (data not shown). For this reason, the IC50 values of the peptides can be compared directly between WT and mutant complexes.Table IIAffinity (IC50 in μm) of four related peptides for HLA-B*2705 WT or C67S mutant and the midpoint of unfolding (Tm in °C) of the corresponding heterotrimersGRAFVTIGKGRFFVTIGKGRAFVTIGIGRAFVTIGSWTIC500.500.171.90>10Tm60575443C67SIC500.670.222.90>10Tm52494137The experimental errors are about 4% and less than 5% forTm and IC50 values, respectively. Open table in a new tab The experimental errors are about 4% and less than 5% forTm and IC50 values, respectively. A typical dose-response curve is shown in Fig.4. The IC50 values obtained by fitting the experimental curve to a dose-response model are listed in Table II. As expected, the higher affinity (in the submicromolar range) was observed for the natural epitope (GRAFVTIGK) and its F3 analog. Replacement of Lys by Ile and Ser at P9 significantly decreased affinity by 1 and up to 2 orders of magnitude, respectively (Table II). Because of the low affinity of the S9 peptide, no complete competition could be observed in the concentration range used for this assay. Therefore, IC50 values for the S9 analog are given as an approximation only. It can be noted that the changes in peptide binding affinity are related to the melting temperatures of the corresponding B*2705/peptide complexes. Surprisingly, the thermal destabilization recorded upon C67S mutation was not mirrored by a decrease in peptide binding affinities (TableII). Very similar IC50 values were observed for all four peptides to either the WT or the C67S B*2705 mutant. It can be noted that IC50 and Tm values are only related when a series of protein-peptide complexes containing identical HC are taken into account. The data from these experiments refer only to the dissociation of the labeled peptide from the MHC complex, as confirmed by complementary FPLC experiments (data not shown). Monitoring fluorescence polarization (FP) versus time is particularly well suited for studying peptide dissociation from B*2705 because FP is directly dependent on changes in molecular weights, and this technique does not require any washing or separation step (26Nasir M.S. Jolley M.E. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 1999; 2: 177-190PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, any release of the labeled peptide from the heterotrimer can be recorded and immediately translated into lower FP values. The complex between the fluorescent peptide (GRAFVTIK*K) and B*2705 is remarkably stable at 26 °C as shown by the FP time course of the corresponding complex at 26 °C (Fig. 5). Upon C67S mutation, the same labeled peptide dissociates faster. This result is in agreement with the thermal denaturation experiments, again showing a higher stability for the HLA-B*2705 WT complex. In the current study we investigated the influence of the amino acids of the B pocket (Thr-24, Glu-45, Cys-67, Tyr-99) that are relevant for peptide binding (11Colbert R.A. Rowland-Jones S.L. McMichael A.J. Frelinger J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6879-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) on the thermodynamic stability of several MHC-peptide complexes. Mutation of any of these amino acids resulted in loss of stability of up to 22 °C, which reflects an extreme influence of even a single amino acid mutation. There are no evident relationships between the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds lost upon mutation and the observed destabilization. For example, the most destabilizing change (T24V) is the consequence of a single H-bond loss, according to the crystal structure of HLA-B*2705 (27Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The Y99F mutation resulting in the loss of one direct and two water-mediated H-bonds is also very destabilizing and illustrates the importance of a bound water molecule in the B pocket (27Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, modification of the polarity of the B pocket upon E45M mutation did not alter refolding of the B*2705 HC in the presence of Arg-2-containing peptides, although Arg-2 has been shown by x-ray diffraction to make a salt bridge to Glu-45, and despite the lack of evidence for an Arg-2 motif after pool sequencing, the peptide pool naturally bound to this mutant (28Villadangos J.A. Galocha B. Garcia F. Albar J.P. Lopez de Castro J.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2370-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Among the three peptides evaluated, the S9 complex was always the one that induced the least stable complexes. It has to be noted that the WT complexes loaded with S9 already have a low stability (20Dedier S. Reinelt S. Reitinger T. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27055-27061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that until a certain threshold of stability (Tm of ∼36 °C) has been reached, the mutation of such weakly stable complexes will have little influence on their thermodynamic properties. However, it should be stated that lower in vitrothermodynamic stability might not always be related to lower in vivo stability, because some potentially weakly stable complexes are not refolded in vivo, or the corresponding peptide is presented in very low amounts. Interestingly, the C67S mutant destabilized the complex less drastically than the other three mutants of the B pocket. Some recent publications give great importance to Cys-67, because this residue is implicated in the formation of heavy chain homodimers. For this reason, we decided to focus our experiments on the C67S mutant. Our data show a significant difference between thermal unfolding of HLA-B*2705 and HLA-A*0201 complexes with regard to response to variation of pH. Shifting the pH toward alkaline conditions induces a two-step thermal unfolding. The first one is clearly peptide-dependent and is probably the consequence of peptide release from the heterotrimer. The second one, which appears at basic pH, is significantly increased for MHC proteins bearing a free cysteine (HLA-B*2705 WT, HLA-A*0201 V67C mutant). A simple explanation for these different unfolding processes can be clearly attributed to the amino acid at position 67 of HC with Cys-67 responsible for an increased final degree of unfolding after the second transition. Mutation of the amino acid at position 67 of the HC is reflected by almost complete interchange of the unfolding profiles of HLA-B*2705 and HLA-A*0201/peptide complexes. It is already known that Cys-67 is more acidic than expected, because it can be alkylated by an aziridine-containing peptide ligand whereas free Cys in solution cannot (15Weiss G.A. Valentekovich R.J. Collins E.J. Garboczi D.N. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10945-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, any increase in the pH would favor the existence of Cys-67 as a very nucleophilic thiolate anion promoting oligomerization of the B*2705 HC. Our hypothesis is supported by size exclusion chromatography of unfolded intermediates of B*2705 and its C67S mutant, obtained at basic pH. It clearly indicates that the mutation of Cys-67 results in the loss of high molecular weight unfolded states that characterize the unfolded B*2705 WT heavy chain. Surprisingly, the observed destabilization of the heterotrimer upon Cys-67 mutation is not reflected by a decreased affinity of peptide ligands to the mutant (Table II). We have shown that IC50 values for three analogous peptides are not significantly affected by mutation of Cys-67 to Ser. These data are contradictory to previous results (29Morgan C.S. Holton J.M. Olafson B.D. Bjorkman P.J. Mayo S.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1771-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) for which a correlation between the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD)and thermal stability (Tm) of the complex is described. They can however easily be explained by the different experimental protocols used in both studies. Whereas Morgan et al. (29Morgan C.S. Holton J.M. Olafson B.D. Bjorkman P.J. Mayo S.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1771-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) correlatesKD values obtained from equilibrium dialysis experiments using a refolded peptide-free HC (29Morgan C.S. Holton J.M. Olafson B.D. Bjorkman P.J. Mayo S.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1771-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), our assay includes the refolding of the heterotrimer in the presence of the peptide and therefore does not lack the important contributions of protein-peptide interactions for complex refolding. Furthermore, as peptide loading of class I MHC complexes occurs in vivo during folding of the proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (30Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), our assay is more likely to mirror physiological conditions and therefore is more suited to compare peptide selection of complexes containing different heavy chains subtypes. The different contributions of Cys-67 to thermal stability and peptide binding suggest that Cys-67 is not directly involved in MHC-peptide interactions participating in the refolding of the HC-β2m-peptide heterotrimer. However, once the MHC-peptide complex has been formed, Cys-67, as well as any amino acid of the B pocket, plays an important role in maintaining a stable heterotrimer. Regarding these findings, our study strongly suggests that the nature of the selected peptide repertoire is not sufficient to explain the different associations of HC subtypes with autoimmune diseases (31Alvarez I. López de Castro J.A. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2000; 12: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Whereas the unfolding behavior of HLA-B*2705 is clearly different from that of HLA-A*0201 because of the presence of a free cysteine, it is still not clear why the expression of several alleles has not been associated with high susceptibility to autoimmune disorders, Cys-67 being conserved in all 20 HLA-B27 alleles reported to date (10Khan M.A. J. Rheumatol. 2000; 27: 1110-1114PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the results presented here confirm the important role of Cys-67 for in vitro properties of HLA-B*2705 complexes. This observation is an interesting example of the enormous influence of a single amino acid on the unfolding process of a protein. This finding is even more important in regard to the recently reported theory that postulates that misfolded MHC-proteins are causative for the association of HLA-B*2705 and autoimmune diseases (7Allen R.L. Bowness P. McMichael A. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Our data show that the HLA-B*2705 complex unfolds in a subtype-specific manner upon thermal denaturation. This observation suggests that not only heavy chain dimers (18Allen R.L. O'Callaghan C.A. McMichael A.J. Bowness P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5045-5048PubMed Google Scholar) but also abnormally unfolded complexes may be the species responsible for autoimmune disease. Dimerization of class I MHC-HC seems to be a general property of HC containing unpaired Cys-residues (32Capps G.G. Robinson B.E. Lewis K.D. Zuniga M.C. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 159-169PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore it cannot explain the peculiar association of B*2705 expression with autoimmune diseases. Triggering could either occur by altered TCR recognition or endoplasmic reticulum stress due to an increased level of protein aggregation (4Colbert R.A. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 224-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 33Aridor M. Balch W.E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It will be important to evaluate whether these specific properties of the complex are relevant for activation of CTL resulting in autoreactivity. However, the peculiar structural influence of Cys-67 on the thermodynamic property of HLA-B*2705 does not explain why the expression of a few B27 alleles is not associated with autoimmune disorders (10Khan M.A. J. Rheumatol. 2000; 27: 1110-1114PubMed Google Scholar) even though Cys-67 is conserved for all B27 alleles. Rats transgenic for the C67S HLA-B*2705 mutant still develop arthritis, albeit with less severity than WT B*2705 rats (34Taurog J.D. Maika S.D. Satumtira N. Dorris M.L. McLean I.L. Yanagisawa H. Sayad A. Stagg A.J. Fox G.M. Le O'Brien A. Rehman M. Zhou M. Weiner A.L. Splawski J.B. Richardson J.A. Hammer R.E. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 169: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether only Cys-67 has the described influence or if mutation of further B pocket amino acids specific for HLA-B*2705 can induce similar effects.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4231-4239Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar).Initially, studies of rRNA processing reported a split processing scheme for the independent maturation of the large and small subunit RNAs (5Van Nues R.W. Venema J. Planta R.J. Raue H.A. Neirhaus K.H. Franceschi F. Subramanian A.R. The Translation Apparatus. Plenum Press, New York1993: 151-162Google Scholar). Indeed, some mature rRNA is observed when the sequences are not linked genetically (6Liang W.Q. Fournier M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2864-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). More recent studies, however, have begun to demonstrate interdependences that dramatically affect the efficiency of maturation and/or the stability of the products. For example, an extended hairpin structure in the 3′-ETS has been shown to be critical not only to the processing of the 3′-end in the large subunit rRNA but also to the maturation of the 5.8 S RNA some 3000 nucleotides upstream of it (7Melekhovets Y.F. Good L. Abou Elela S. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, the deletion of the ITS2 sequence has been shown to be critical to the maturation of the large subunit but also to have severe effects on the level of 18 S rRNA production (8Good L. Intine R.V.A. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 782-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and as already indicated, a U3snoRNA·5′-ETS complex appears to be essential for the initiation of pre-rRNA processing overall. Because the pre-rRNA is fully transcribed and assembled into a large 80–90 S nucleolar precursor particle before rRNA processing is initiated (9Kumar A. Warner J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 63: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), these observations pose intriguing questions about the nature and role of the nucleolar precursor ribonucleoprotein particle. Apparently, at least in part, these processes contribute to a quality control mechanism that helps ensure that only functional RNA is incorporated into mature ribosomal particles (8Good L. Intine R.V.A. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 782-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).In search of structural features that underlie the interdependences as well as possible roles of the transcribed spacers in rRNA maturation, we initially looked for interactions between the spacer regions and soluble cellular constituents (10Lalev A.I. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Lalev A.I. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Using gel retardation studies we were able to demonstrate specific interactions between individual transcribed spacer sequences and cellular proteins (10Lalev A.I. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and using ITS1 RNA we were able to isolate a complex of proteins that interacted specifically with this spacer sequence (12Lalev A.I. Abeyrathne P.D. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This complex, a ribosome assembly chaperone (RAC), contained at least 20 proteins ranging in size from 20 to 200 kDa. Mass spectroscopy and computer analyses suggested that many of the proteins contained RNA binding motifs or were nuclear in localization. Additional RNA components were not evident. In the present study, proteins interacting with the ITS2 region also were isolated for further characterization. Subsequent comparative analyses now indicate that a single protein complex has independent binding sites for all the transcribed spacers in the pre-rRNA.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn a previous study (11Lalev A.I. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), gel retardation analyses indicated that the extended hairpin in the S. pombe ITS2 sequence interacted specifically with one or more soluble proteins. In the present study, the ITS2 region of the S. pombe pre-rRNA was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase (13Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4048) Google Scholar) and used as a ligand in affinity chromatography (12Lalev A.I. Abeyrathne P.D. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to isolate and further characterize the ITS2-specific spacer binding proteins from a cellular extract. The ITS2 sequence first was fused to a polyguanylic acid cluster that permitted the preparation of RNA with a poly(G) tail, which subsequently was used to immobilize the RNA on a poly(C)-agarose matrix (12Lalev A.I. Abeyrathne P.D. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Protein was applied in low salt buffer (14Neupert B. Thompson N.A. Meyer C. Kuhn L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with calf liver RNA to eliminate nonspecific binding. After an extensive wash with 0.133 m KCl, the bound protein was eluted sequentially with buffer containing 0.3 and 1.0 m KCl. As shown in Fig.1 (left), the 0.3m fraction contained the majority of protein that effectively formed a stable ribonucleoprotein complex with ITS2 RNA (+). When this band was excised and polymerized into the stacking layer of a standard SDS-acrylamide protein analysis gel and the protein components were electrophoretically fractionated, a diverse group of proteins was evident (Fig. 1, right). Despite the surprisingly large number of proteins, most bands were present in similar amounts, consistent with a homogeneous protein complex (RAC).Because an equally large number of proteins also was isolated in the earlier study using ITS1 RNA (12Lalev A.I. Abeyrathne P.D. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the ITS1- and ITS2-associated proteins were compared directly. In each case the fraction containing the majority of the spacer binding protein was used, the 1.0m fraction for ITS1 and the 0.3 m fraction for ITS2. As shown in Fig. 2, despite differences in the RNA ligands and in the elution conditions, the protein components that formed a ribonucleoprotein complex were found to be largely or completely identical. The fact that the same protein complex was eluted at different salt concentrations (1.0versus 0.3 m KCl) raised the possibility that each ITS region interacted with a separate binding site in the protein complex.Figure 2Comparison of RAC complex proteins purified with alternate ITS sequence ligands. Ribonucleoprotein was prepared with labeled S. pombe ITS1 and ITS2 RNA, and the protein constituents were fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel as described in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Earlier studies already had suggested limited sequence equivalence in the ITS sequences, but some competition for protein was evident when large excesses of competing RNA were present (10Lalev A.I. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Lalev A.I. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This raised the alternate possibility that the two internal spacers competed for a common binding site, a possibility that also is consistent with the similarities in the protein components (Fig. 2). To evaluate these possibilities further, a complex formation was examined under more competitive conditions. As illustrated in Fig.3 A (lane b) with ITS2 RNA, in these studies the amount of affinity-purified protein was limited to allow ∼80% of the labeled RNA to be incorporated into a ribonucleoprotein complex. As also shown in Fig. 3 A, when an equal amount of ITS1 RNA was included (lane c), the amount of ITS2 RNA in the complex was not reduced and ∼80% of the ITS1 molecules were incorporated into the ribonucleoprotein complex as well (lane c). This observation indicated that the two sequences were not directly competing for the same site; rather, they were equally bound in two separate sites. Such a model was further supported when an equal amount of ITS2 sequence was added instead of ITS1. As shown in Fig. 3 B, under these conditions ITS1 was efficiently incorporated into the complex (lane c), but further ITS2 RNA was not incorporated (lane d) and ∼60% of the total or all of the extra ITS2 RNA remained unbound.Figure 3Distinct ITS binding sites in the S. pombe RAC complex. A, in vitrosynthesized and labeled ITS2 RNA (a) was incubated with affinity-purified protein (RAC) in the absence (b) or presence (c) of an equal amount of labeled ITS1 RNA (d). B, in vitro synthesized and labeled ITS2 RNA (a) was incubated with affinity-purified protein (RAC) in the absence (b) or presence (c) of an equal amount of labeled ITS1 RNA or an equal amount (total = 2 ×) of labeled ITS2 RNA (d). Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) formation was assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Equal amounts of ITS1 and ITS2 RNA are bound in two distinct sites (c); extra ITS1 is not bound in the ITS2 site (B, lane d).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous studies on the 3′-ETS region in the S. pombepre-rRNA based on gel retardation analyses have indicated that a conserved, extended hairpin structure in this transcribed spacer also forms a stable ribonucleoprotein complex with cellular protein, a complex that has been experimentally linked with rRNA maturation (15Hitchen J.H. Ivakine E. Melekhovets Y.F. Lalev A.I. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Studies on the 5′-ETS (16Intine R.V.A. Good L. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 695-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) again have identified an extended hairpin structure that is critical to rRNA maturation. Competition studies between the 3′-ETS and either unlabeled internal transcribed spacer did not show a relationship in protein-binding sites, although a limited sequence homology appeared present and raised the possibility of a structural equivalence (11Lalev A.I. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that the RAC complex also contained binding sites for the external spacers, ribonucleoprotein formation again was examined using the affinity-purified protein. As shown in Fig.4 A, the results with the 3′-ETS were strikingly similar to those observed with the two internal spacers (Fig. 2). The 3′-ETS-derived RNA (lane e) was able to form a stable complex (lane d). More importantly, in the presence of ITS1-derived RNA (lane c) both RNAs were incorporated equally into the complex whereas the amount of complex-bound 3′-ETS remained constant. This observation again supported comparable but distinct binding sites for both spacer regions. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the 5′-ETS-derived RNA also formed a stable ribonucleoprotein complex (lane d) with ITS-purified protein. Again, in the presence of ITS1-derived RNA (lane c) both RNAs were equally incorporated and no 5′-ETS was displaced.Figure 4Distinct ETS binding sites in the S. pombe RAC complex. A, in vitrosynthesized and labeled ITS1 (a) or 3′-ETS (e) RNA was incubated with affinity-purified protein (RAC) individually (b and d, respectively) or together (c). B, in vitro synthesized and labeled ITS1 (a) or 5′-ETS (e) RNA was incubated with affinity-purified protein (RAC) individually (b andd, respectively) or together (c). Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) formation was assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The protein binds an equal amount of each spacer in distinct sites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The specific nature of this interaction was further demonstrated when complex formation was reexamined in the presence of excess unlabeled spacer RNA (Fig. 5). When ITS1 binding was compared with the 5′-ETS (Fig. 5 A) in the presence of unlabeled ITS1-derived RNA (lane d), only labeled ITS1-derived RNA was displaced and in the presence of unlabeled 5′-ETS-derived RNA (lane e), only labeled 5′-ETS-derived RNA was displaced. These observations again were entirely consistent with separate and specific spacer binding sites. Similarly, when ITS1 binding was compared with ITS2 (Fig. 5 B), equivalent results were obtained. In the presence of unlabeled ITS1-derived RNA (lane c), only labeled ITS1 RNA was displaced and in the presence of unlabeled ITS2-derived RNA (lane d), only labeled ITS2 RNA was displaced. Once more these results strongly supported separate and specific binding sites.Figure 5Spacer-specific binding sites in the S. pombe RAC complex. A, in vitrosynthesized and labeled ITS1 (a) and 5′-ETS (b) RNA were incubated together with affinity-purified protein (RAC) individually (b and d, respectively) or together (c–e) in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ITS1 (d) or 5′-ETS (e) RNA.B, in vitro synthesized and labeled ITS1 and ITS2 RNAs (a) were incubated together with affinity-purified protein (RAC) (c and d) in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ITS1 (c) or ITS2 (d) RNA. Excess unlabeled RNA displaces only equivalent labeled RNA.RNP, ribonucleoprotein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Taken together, the results of this study provided experimental evidence for a model of rRNA maturation (Fig.6) that we first suggested to explain distant effects in rRNA processing (17R. N. Nazar L. Good R. V. A. Intine Y. Lee Y. F. Melekhovets RNA'96. the First Annual Meeting of the RNA Society, Madison, WI,May-30-1996Google Scholar). The model proposes that as ribosomal proteins assemble on the mature ribosomal RNA sequences, nucleolar constituents simultaneously assemble on the spacer regions basically forming a nucleolar pre-rRNA particle consisting of three domains; two of those domains correspond with the ribosomal subunits and one domain is composed of spacers and nucleolar proteins or RNAs, comprising a common processing domain. The RAC complex described in this study would represent the core of this domain with spacer sequences and transacting factors appropriately organized on this core. Normally this particle fully forms before rRNA cleavages are initiated (9Kumar A. Warner J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 63: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and appears to be essential for an efficient maturation of the ribosomal RNA (7Melekhovets Y.F. Good L. Abou Elela S. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Kumar A. Warner J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 63: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Hitchen J.H. Ivakine E.

Biol. 1999; 286: 695-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our past studies on the RNA spacer sequences are entirely consistent with such a model. For example, mutations in the known protein-binding site of the 3′-ETS (15Hitchen J.H. Ivakine E. Melekhovets Y.F. Lalev A.I. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or ITS1 RNA (12Lalev A.I. Abeyrathne P.D. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) also have been shown to dramatically affect RNA maturation with comparable effects on protein binding. Furthermore, mutations in the protein-binding regions in the ITS2 (11Lalev A.I. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and 5′-ETS (16Intine R.V.A. Good L. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 695-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) sequences have been shown to critically affect RNA maturation, and equivalent regions in the internal spacers of the preribosomal RNA ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae also have been shown to be essential for rRNA processing (18Van Nues R.W. Rientjes J.M.J. Morre S.A. Mollee E. Planta R.J. Venema J. Raue H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Figure 6A model for the assembly of a nucleolar 80–90 S preribosomal particle. Ribosomal proteins assemble on the rRNA sequences to form the ribosomal subunits whereas the nucleolar RAC proteins assemble on the spacer sequences to form a common processing domain that is acted on by nucleases and other nucleolar factors or RNAs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As noted earlier, in many ways the particle described in this study resembles the spliceosomal complexes associated with mRNA processing. As in the case of spliceosomes, the roles of individual proteins in the present complex remain unclear. Our attempts to demonstrate specific cleavages with the affinity-purified RAC protein have failed (results not shown), but various alternate enzymatic activities associated with rRNA maturation previously have been reported (19Venema J. Tollervey D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the affinity-purified protein acts not to cleave the RNA but to organize it in a way that allows its precise and efficient cleavage by other peptides such as the RNase III-like enzymes (20Abou Elela S. Igel H. Ares Jr., M. Cell. 1996; 85: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 21Rotondo G. Frendewey D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2377-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the Rrp4p protein, and the related “exosome” (22Allmang C. Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Nucleic. Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1684-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In this respect the new complex would act as a ribosome assembly chaperone or a kind of “rack” on which the maturing structures are organized. The protein complex may even act by sterically hindering the processing enzymes, allowing complexes such as the “exosome” to act only in a limited and defined fashion. Whatever the case, the new particle (RAC) raises a very different picture of ribosome maturation and provides an explanation for the previously described distant interdependences in rRNA maturation that, at least in part, serve as a “quality control” mechanism for ribosome biogenesis (8Good L. Intine R.V.A. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 782-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17R. N. Nazar L. Good R. V. A. Intine Y. Lee Y. F. Melekhovets RNA'96. the First Annual Meeting of the RNA Society, Madison, WI,May-30-1996Google Scholar). The introns of eukaryotic mRNA precursors interact with snRNAs1 and many proteins to form a large “spliceosome” complex (1Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar) that catalyzes both the excision of the intron and the splicing of the remaining RNA to produce the mature coding sequence (2Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R. Atkins J. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-357Google Scholar). Ribosomal RNA transcripts also represent large precursor molecules from which transcribed spacers are excised to form the RNA components of the mature ribosomal subunits. Although RNA splicing is not necessary in this process, several snoRNAs also have been implicated in the cleavage of the pre-rRNA (3Morrissey J.P. Tollervey D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 78-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and a U3 snoRNA·5′-ETS complex has been postulated to be essential for the initiation of rRNA processing (4Hughes J.M. Ares Jr., M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4231-4239Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar).

In the present study we have investigated the role of cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2) and AA in acetylcholine (ACh)- and bombesin-induced Ca2+ signaling. Inhibition of cPLA2 caused acceleration of ACh-induced Ca2+waves, whereas bombesin-evoked Ca2+ waves were unaffected. When enzymatic metabolization of AA was prevented with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or the lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid, ACh-induced Ca2+ waves were slowed down. Agonist-induced activation of cPLA2involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. An increase in phosphorylation of p38MAPK and p42/44MAPK within 10 s after stimulation could be demonstrated for ACh but was absent for bombesin. Rapid phosphorylation of p38MAPK and p42/44MAPK could also be observed in the presence of cholecystokinin (CCK), which also causes activation of cPLA2. ACh-and CCK-induced Ca2+waves were slowed down when p38MAPK was inhibited with SB 203580, whereas inhibition of p42/44MAPK with PD 98059 caused acceleration of ACh- and CCK-induced Ca2+waves. The spreading of bombesin-evoked Ca2+ waves was affected neither by PD 98059 nor by SB 203580. Our data indicate that in mouse pancreatic acinar cells both ACh and CCK receptors couple to the cPLA2 pathway. cPLA2 activation occurs within 1–2 s after hormone application and is promoted by p42/44MAPK and inhibited by p38MAPK. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that secondary (Ca2+-induced) Ca2+ release, which supports Ca2+ wave spreading, is inhibited by AA itself and not by a metabolite of AA.

Furthermore, the data demonstrate that secondary (Ca2+-induced) Ca2+ release, which supports Ca2+ wave spreading, is inhibited by AA itself and not by a metabolite of AA. acetylcholine arachidonic acid cytosolic phospholipase A2 bombesin nordihydroguaiaretic acid mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase cholecystokinin Ca2+-induced Ca2+release protein kinase C arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone Stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells with the secretagogues acetylcholine (ACh),1cholecystokinin (CCK), or bombesin evokes cytosolic Ca2+waves that initiate within the secretory cell pole and subsequently spread toward the basal cell membrane (1Kasai H.

Ca2+ wave propagation has been explained by sequential Ca2+ release from stores in series involving Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) (4Schulz I. Krause E. González A. Göbel A. Sternfeld L.

Physiol. 2000; 116: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The speed of Ca2+waves depends on the type of agonist used for stimulation and to some extent also on the agonist concentration (6González A. Schmid A. Sternfeld L. Krause E. Salido G.M. Schulz I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The propagation rate can be modified by application of arachidonic acid (AA) or by activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol esters (6González A. Schmid A. Sternfeld L. Krause E. Salido G.M. Schulz I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Pfeiffer F. Sternfeld L. Schmid A. Schulz I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C663-C672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both application of AA and activation of PKC leads to inhibition of CICR and thereby slows down spreading of Ca2+ signals. Analysis of the propagation rate of secretagogue-evoked Ca2+ waves in pancreatic acinar cells can therefore be used to investigate coupling of hormone receptors to intracellular signal cascades that lead to endogenous production of AA and/or to activation of PKC. In previous studies we could demonstrate that in mouse pancreatic acinar cells bombesin receptors couple to phospholipase D (7Pfeiffer F. Sternfeld L. Schmid A. Schulz I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C663-C672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which produces diacylglycerol and thereby activates PKC, whereas high affinity CCK receptors couple to cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (6González A. Schmid A. Sternfeld L. Krause E. Salido G.M. Schulz I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), an enzyme that leads to release of AA from membrane phospholipids. Bombesin-induced activation of PKC via phospholipase D-dependent diacylglycerol production, as well as CCK-induced formation of AA by cPLA2, takes place within the very first seconds after hormone application, before or during development of the initial inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ signal in the luminal cell pole.In the present study we investigated the role of cPLA2 in ACh- and bombesin-evoked Ca2+ signaling. Our data indicate that in pancreatic acinar cells activation of cPLA2 is an early event in ACh- but not in bombesin-evoked intracellular signaling. ACh- and CCK-induced activation of cPLA2 involves MAP kinase activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that secretagogue-induced Ca2+ signaling in pancreatic acinar cells is modified by AA itself and not by metabolites of AA.RESULTSIt has been shown that stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells with low doses of CCK causes rapid activation of cPLA2 and thereby formation of AA, which slows down spreading of cytosolic Ca2+ signals (6González A. Schmid A. Sternfeld L. Krause E. Salido G.M. Schulz I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To test whether ACh and bombesin receptors also couple to the signal cascade involving cPLA2activation we analyzed the propagation rate of ACh- and bombesin-evoked Ca2+ waves in the presence of AA, the product of cPLA2 activity, or the cPLA2 inhibitor arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) (Fig.1 A). Preincubation of acinar cells with 5 μm AA for 5 min caused slow-down of both ACh- and bombesin-evoked Ca2+ waves. This observation is consistent with the idea that AA inhibits secondary CICR from intracellular stores and therefore causes slower spreading of cytosolic Ca2+ signals (4Schulz I. Krause E. González A. Göbel A. Sternfeld L. Schmid A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1999; 380: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The two concentrations of ACh were chosen as a typical physiological and a supramaximal agonist concentration. The concentration dependence of the propagation rate of ACh-evoked Ca2+ waves is presented in Fig. 1 B. For a reproducible initiation of Ca2+ waves at least 20 nm ACh were necessary. ACh concentrations above 500 nm did not significantly further increase the spreading speed of Ca2+ waves. Fitting of the data with a Hill equation yielded a half-maximal propagation rate at 108 nmACh. On the other hand, bombesin-evoked Ca2+ waves had more or less the same propagation rate (∼ 5 μm/s) over a wide concentration range (100 pm to 5 nm) (Fig.1 C). Only at very low bombesin concentration (30 pm) a slightly decreased propagation rate (3.7 μm/s) and at supramaximally high concentration (10 nm) a slightly increased propagation rate (6.4 μm/s) could be measured. For all further experiments we used bombesin at a concentration of 1 nm.When cells were preincubated with the cPLA2 inhibitor AACOCF3 (10 μm) for 5 min and then stimulated with ACh, a faster propagation of Ca2+ waves could be observed at low (50 nm), as well as high (10 μm), ACh concentrations. In contrast, when bombesin was used for stimulation, AACOCF3 had no effect on Ca2+ wave spreading. The experiments with AACOCF3 indicate a rapid activation of cPLA2 in the presence of ACh but not in the presence of bombesin. Because AACOCF3 did not affect bombesin-evoked Ca2+ waves an unspecific effect of AACOCF3 on cytosolic Ca2+ signaling is unlikely.The enzymatic metabolization of AA produces a large number of regulatory active metabolites. To investigate whether AA itself or one of its metabolites exerts the inhibitory effect on sequential Ca2+ release we stimulated pancreatic acinar cells in the presence of either the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 μm, 5 min preincubation) or the lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA; 30 μm, 5 min preincubation). Both indomethacin and NDGA slowed down spreading of Ca2+ waves elicited at low or high ACh concentrations (Fig.2 A). This demonstrates that AA itself and not a metabolite of AA slows down spreading of cytosolic Ca2+ waves by down-regulation of secondary Ca2+release. Ca2+ waves elicited by bombesin were affected neither by indomethacin nor by NDGA indicating that these substances do not nonspecifically change Ca2+ signaling (Fig.2 A).Figure 2The effects of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (indo.) and of the lipoxygenase inhibitor NDGA on the propagation rate of ACh-, bombesin- and CCK-evoked Ca2+ waves are shown. Indomethacin (10 μm) and NDGA (30 μm) were added to the bath solution 5 min before the respective agonist was added. n.s., not significant; *, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is known that in pancreatic acinar cells stimulation of high affinity CCK receptors leads to strong activation of cPLA2(10Tsunoda Y. Owyang C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G435-G444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and rapid formation of AA, which causes slow spreading of cytosolic Ca2+ waves (6González A. Schmid A. Sternfeld L. Krause E. Salido G.M. Schulz I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The propagation rate of Ca2+ waves at low CCK concentration (20 pm) could not further be reduced by addition of exogenous AA (6González A. Schmid A. Sternfeld L. Krause E. Salido G.M. Schulz I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This was explained by production of already saturating endogenous AA concentrations in the presence of low CCK concentrations. Therefore, it is not surprising that now, in a new series of experiments, indomethacin and NDGA had no or only a small effect, respectively, on the propagation rate of Ca2+ waves elicited by activation of high affinity CCK receptors (Fig. 2 B). However, when low affinity CCK receptors were stimulated by application of CCK at supramaximal concentration (10 nm), indomethacin and NDGA significantly reduced the propagation rate of Ca2+ waves (Fig. 2 B). The differences in the effect of indomethacin and NDGA on Ca2+ waves elicited by low and high concentrations of CCK, respectively, might be because of different delays between hormone application and the initial rise in [Ca2+]cyt. The delay in the Ca2+response to 50 pm CCK was 8.7 s longer than in the response to 10 nm CCK. The short latency in the presence of high CCK concentrations allows only very little production of AA, which is reflected by a fast spreading of Ca2+ waves. In this case, inhibition of AA metabolization by indomethacin and NDGA increases the amount of AA and therefore slows down the propagation of Ca2+ waves. On the other hand, the long latency between application of 50 pm CCK and the initial Ca2+ signal in the cytosol gives time for production of high AA concentrations. Spreading of Ca2+waves in the presence of low CCK concentrations is therefore slow and, if AA reaches saturating concentrations, cannot be further slowed down by inhibition of AA metabolization.There is growing evidence that the MAP kinases p42/44MAPKand p38MAPK can regulate the activity of cPLA2(11Kramer R.M.

To investigate whether in mouse pancreatic acinar cells p42/44MAPK and p38MAPK are also involved in agonist-induced activation of cPLA2 we analyzed the propagation rate of cytosolic Ca2+ waves in the presence and absence of the specific MAP kinase inhibitors PD 98059 and SB 203580. Inhibition of p42/44MAPK by preincubation of cells with 10 μm PD 98059 for 5 min significantly accelerated the speed of CCK-induced Ca2+ waves at low and high agonist concentration, whereas a slower spreading of CCK-induced Ca2+ waves could be observed when cells were preincubated with the p38MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 (10 μm) for 5 min (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, neither PD 98509 nor SB 203580 had any significant effect on Ca2+ waves elicited with bombesin (Fig. 3 A). When ACh was used for stimulation, preincubation of the cells with the p38MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 (10 μm) caused a significant slow-down of Ca2+ waves at both low and high ACh concentrations. On the other hand, inhibition of p42/44MAPK with PD 98059 produced a faster spreading of Ca2+ waves only when 50 nm ACh was used for initiation of Ca2+ waves but had no significant effect on Ca2+ waves elicited by 10 μm ACh. A possible explanation for this observation might be that in pancreatic acinar cells, similar as in other cell types, several parallel pathways exist that activate cPLA2 (16Lin W.W. Chen B.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1601-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Li W.H. Llopis J. Dennis E.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5398-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the experiments with high ACh the inhibitory effect of p38MAPK could prevail over the stimulatory effect of p42/44MAPK. Nevertheless, activation of cPLA2 could be accomplished by a parallel pathway bypassing the p42/44 MAP kinase pathway. In consequence, we would have little effect of PD 98059 that might be overlooked in our experiments, whereas inhibition of p38MAPK with SB 203580 (Fig.3 A) or inhibition of cPLA2 with AACOCF3 (Fig. 1 A) would produce clear effects. The data suggest that in mouse pancreatic acinar cells activation of p42/44MAPK and p38MAPK is an early event in stimulus-secretion coupling that already occurs before cytosolic Ca2+ signals are generated. Furthermore, the data suggest that there is a regulatory cross-talk between p42/44MAPKand p38MAPK. cPLA2 activation is promoted by p42/44MAPK whereas p38MAPK has an inhibitory effect.Figure 3The effect of MAP kinase inhibitors PD 98059 and SB 203580 on the propagation rate of ACh-, bombesin- and CCK-evoked Ca2+ waves is shown.

Stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells with either CCK or ACh caused a significant increase in p42/44MAPK phosphorylation within 10 s after hormone application (Fig.4 A). When bombesin was used instead, after 10 s there was no significant increase in p42/44MAPK phosphorylation compared with control experiments without agonist (Fig. 4 A). Stimulation of acinar cells with ACh and CCK also caused an increase in phosphorylation of p38MAPK, whereas no increase in p38MAPKphosphorylation could be found 10 s after addition of bombesin (Fig. 4 B). Agonist-dependent activation of MAP kinases could be demonstrated in in vitro experiments using exogenously added PHAS-I as MAP kinase phosphorylation substrate (Fig.4 C) (9Haystead T.A. Haystead C.M. Hu C. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A significantly higher amount of phosphorylated PHAS-I could be detected when cells were stimulated with ACh or CCK for 10 s, whereas there was no significant increase in PHAS-I phosphorylation in experiments with bombesin. MAP kinase activation in the presence of bombesin could only be observed when cells were stimulated for more than 1 min (Fig. 4 C). However, this late activation of MAP kinases in the presence of bombesin occurs when the agonist-evoked cytosolic Ca2+ wave had already traveled through the cell, and it is therefore not surprising that MAP kinase inhibitors could not affect the propagation rate of bombesin-elicited Ca2+ waves.Figure 4Stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells with ACh or CCK for 10 s causes a significant increase in the phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK (A) and p38MAPK(B). No increase in MAP kinase phosphorylation could be found when bombesin was applied for 10 s. MAP kinase phosphorylation was detected with antibodies against the phosphorylated form of p42/44MAPK and p38MAPK (middle panels). Antibodies raised against the non-phosphorylated form were used as control (upper panels). MAP kinase activation is demonstrated using PHAS-I as substrate (C). In a 10-s period after ACh and CCK application MAP kinase activity increased about 40% compared with control experiments. Short term stimulation with bombesin had no effect on MAP kinase activity. However, when bombesin was present for more than 1 min this agonist caused MAP kinase activation. Negative regulation of p42/44MAPK by p38MAPK could be demonstrated when p42/44MAPK-dependent PHAS-I phosphorylation was measured after cell lysis and immunoprecipitation of p42/44MAPK (D). Inhibition of p38MAPK activity with SB 203580 during cell stimulation with ACh caused a significantly higher p42/44MAPK activity than in the absence of SB 203580. n.s., not significant; *,p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm a regulatory cross-talk between p38MAPK and p42/44MAPK we stimulated pancreatic acinar cells with ACh in the presence and absence of MAP kinase inhibitors and measured p42/44MAPK-dependent PHAS-I phosphorylation after cell lysis and immunoprecipitation of p42/44MAPK. Stimulation of acinar cells with 1 μm ACh for 30 s produced an ∼2-fold increase in p42/44MAPK-dependent PHAS-I phosphorylation compared with control experiments without ACh (Fig. 4 D). More or less the same p42/44MAPK-dependent PHAS-I phosphorylation as under control conditions could be found when cells were treated with either 10 μm PD 98059 or 10 μm SB 203580 for 5 min prior to cell lysis. Activity of p42/44MAPK was measured after immunoprecipitation of p42/44MAPK and removal of PD 98059 and SB 203580, respectively. When cells were preincubated with PD 98059 and then stimulated with ACh in the presence of PD 98059 (Fig. 4 D,4th column), about the same increase in p42/44MAPK activity could be detected as in stimulation experiments without PD 98059 (Fig. 4 D, 2nd column). This is not astonishing, because the presence of PD 98059 during stimulation of the cells with ACh inhibits p42/44MAPK activity but not ACh-dependent p42/44MAPK activation. For the measurement of p42/44MAPK activity PD 98059 was removed by immunoprecipitation of p42/44MAPK. On the other hand when cells were stimulated with ACh in the presence of the p38MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 a much higher p42/44MAPK activity could be observed after immunoprecipitation of p42/44MAPK. These experiments indicate that stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells with ACh causes rapid activation of both p42/44MAPK and p38MAPK. Activation of p42/44MAPK is negatively controlled by simultaneous activation of p38MAPK.DISCUSSIONThe propagation rate of agonist-evoked Ca2+ waves in mouse pancreatic acinar cells is modulated by activation of PKC- and cPLA2-dependent formation of AA (7Pfeiffer F. Sternfeld L. Schmid A. Schulz I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C663-C672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of the propagation speed of Ca2+ waves can therefore be used to demonstrate agonist-dependent activation of PKC and cPLA2 in single cells within the first seconds after hormone application. By measurements of Ca2+ waves we could show in a previous study that in pancreatic acinar cells high affinity CCK receptors couple to a signal cascade that leads to activation of cPLA2 (6González A. Schmid A. Sternfeld L. Krause E. Salido G.M. Schulz I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Activation of cPLA2 and formation of AA occurred before the CCK-evoked Ca2+ wave spread from the luminal to the basal cell pole. In the present study we show that preincubation of cells with the cPLA2 inhibitor AACOCF3 also accelerates ACh-evoked Ca2+ waves whereas bombesin-evoked Ca2+ waves were unaffected. We therefore conclude that ACh receptors activate the same signal cascade as high affinity CCK receptors, whereas in bombesin-induced Ca2+ signaling the cPLA2 pathway is not involved. The fact that Ca2+ waves evoked by 10 μm ACh are traveling much faster than Ca2+ waves elicited by low ACh concentrations might be because of the different delays between agonist binding and initiation of cytosolic Ca2+ waves. Ca2+ waves elicited by 10 μm ACh started 1.8 ± 0.2 s (n = 94) after hormone application, whereas Ca2+ signals elicited by 50 nm ACh had a delay of 4.7 ± 0.5 s (n = 86). Therefore, the amount of AA produced before initiation of Ca2+ waves might be higher in the presence of 50 nm ACh. This means stronger inhibition of secondary Ca2+ release and slower spreading of Ca2+ waves in the presence of 50 nm ACh compared with experiments with 10 μm ACh.In a previous study we showed that the inhibitory effects of activated PKC and AA on Ca2+ wave spreading are not additive, suggesting that both signal pathways converge to the same Ca2+ release mechanism (6González A. Schmid A. Sternfeld L. Krause E. Salido G.M. Schulz I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which AA inhibits Ca2+ release is still unclear. Because inhibition of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase with indomethacin and NDGA slowed down CCK- and ACh-evoked Ca2+waves, we can conclude that AA itself and not a metabolite exerts the inhibitory effect on Ca2+ wave spreading. With electrophysiological methods an inhibitory effect of AA has also been shown on inositol polyphosphate-evoked long term Ca2+signaling in mouse (18Rowles S.J. Gallacher D.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and rat (19Maruyama Y. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1993; 463: 729-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) pancreatic acinar cells. As in our experiments this long term effect of AA could not be abolished by inhibition of AA metabolization with indomethacin and NDGA (19Maruyama Y. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1993; 463: 729-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells with CCK causes activation of p42/44MAPK and p38MAPK (20Bragado M.J. Groblewski G.E.

Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 1731-1739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that in pancreatic acinar cells due to the tissue isolation procedure cytokine expression can be up-regulated by p38MAPK (23Blinman T.A. Gukovsky I. Mouria M. Zaninovic V. Livingston E. Pandol S.J. Gukovskaya A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1993-C2003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our experiments indicate that besides this long term effect on protein synthesis MAP kinases are also part of feedback mechanisms that control agonist-evoked Ca2+signaling. With biochemical methods we could demonstrate that there is a significant phosphorylation of both p42/44MAPK and p38MAPK within 10 s after ACh and CCK application. Furthermore, the analysis of the propagation rate of Ca2+waves in the presence and absence of MAP kinase inhibitors gives evidence that MAP kinase activation already occurs within the delay between agonist application and initiation of cytosolic Ca2+ signals. This means that there is already significant MAP kinase activation within less than 1.8 s after ACh (10 μm) or CCK (10 nm) application. p42/44MAPK and p38MAPK exert antagonizing effects on Ca2+ wave spreading; p42/44MAPKactivation causes slower propagation of Ca2+ waves whereas activation of p38MAPK causes faster Ca2+ wave spreading. This might be explained by a regulatory cross-talk between p38MAPK and p42/44MAPK. Inhibition of the p42/44MAPK signaling cascade by p38MAPK has been shown in a study on the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 (24Singh R.P. Dhawan P. Golden C. Kapoor G.S. Mehta K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19593-19600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The rapid activation of p38MAPK might also be involved in reorganization of actin cytoskeleton (21Schäfer C. Ross S.E. Bragado M.J. Groblewski G.E. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24173-24180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and regulation of enzyme secretion.Our data indicate that analysis of the propagation rate of agonist-evoked Ca2+ waves is a powerful tool to study coupling of different hormone receptors to intracellular signal cascades. In the present study we demonstrate that in pancreatic acinar cells not only high affinity CCK but also ACh receptors couple to the cPLA2 pathway. cPLA2-dependent formation of AA is an early event in intracellular signaling and exerts a negative control on Ca2+ wave spreading. Stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells with the secretagogues acetylcholine (ACh),1cholecystokinin (CCK), or bombesin evokes cytosolic Ca2+waves that initiate within the secretory cell pole and subsequently spread toward the basal cell membrane (1Kasai H.
