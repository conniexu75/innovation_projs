https://openalex.org/W1603878868,"Since S-nitrosylation of protein thiols is one of the cellular regulatory mechanisms induced by nitric oxide (NO), and since protein kinase C (PKC) has critical thiol residues which influence its kinase activity, we have determined whether NO could regulate this enzyme. Initial studies were carried out with purified PKC and the NO-generating agent S-nitrosocysteine. This agent decreased phosphotransferase activity of PKC in a Ca(2+)- and oxygen-dependent manner with an IC50 of 75 microM. Phorbol ester binding was affected partially only at higher concentrations (> 100 microM) of S-nitrosocysteine. This inactivation of PKC was blocked by the NO scavenger oxyhemoglobin or reversed by dithiothreitol. It is likely that NO initially induced an S-nitrosylation of vicinal thiols, which were then oxidized to form an intramolecular disulfide. Other NO-generating agents such as S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine and sodium nitroprusside, as well as authentic NO gas, induced similar types of PKC modifications. In intact B16 melanoma cells treated with S-nitrosocysteine a rapid decrease in PKC activity in both cytosol and membrane was observed. Unlike in experiments with purified PKC, in intact cells treated with S-nitrosocysteine the phorbol ester binding also decreased to a rate equal to that of PKC activity. These modifications were readily reversed by treating the homogenates with dithiothreitol in test tubes or by removing the NO-generating source from intact cells. To determine whether the limited amounts of NO generated within the intact cells could induce this type of PKC modification, the macrophage cell line IC-21 was treated with lipopolysacharide and Ca2+ ionophore A23187 to induce the NO production. With an increase in generation of NO (3-12-h period) in these cells, a parallel and irreversible decrease in PKC activity and phorbol ester binding was observed. A specific inhibitor for NO synthase, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, inhibited both the production of NO and PKC inactivation. In experiments using purified enzyme or intact cells there was no decrease in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Conceivably, NO production for limited time induces a reversible inactivation of PKC due to the formation of a disulfide bridge(s), whereas the chronic production of NO could induce irreversible inactivation of PKC. The reversible or irreversible inactivations of PKC may in part influence NO-mediated cytoprotective or cytotoxic actions, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1587842387,"Tissue factor pathway inhibitor is a multivalent, Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor. It directly inhibits factor Xa and, in a factor Xa-dependent fashion, produces feedback inhibition of the factor VIIa/tissue factor catalytic complex which is responsible for the initiation of coagulation. Human recombinant TFPI (rTFPI) produced in Escherichia coli was used to define the kinetic constants describing the human factor Xa:TFPI interaction. The inactivation of factor Xa by E. coli-rTFPI is indistinguishable from that of rTFPI produced in mammalian SK-hepatoma cells, suggesting that post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation do not play a major role in the inhibitory process. The slow, tight-binding inhibition of factor Xa follows the scheme: [formula: see text] Where the enzyme (E) and inhibitor (I) form an initial, immediate collision complex (EI) that then isomerizes slowly to a tightened final EI* complex. In the absence of other additions, the initial Ki (=k2/k1) and final Ki* for the inhibition of factor Xa by E. coli-rTFPI are 1.24 nM and 26.4 pM, respectively. In the presence of calcium ions (5 mM) the interaction between factor Xa and rTFPI is substantially weaker, with a Ki of 42.7 nM and Ki* of 85.2 pM. The addition of other components of the prothrombinase complex produces enhanced factor Xa inhibition predominantly through an effect on the initial Ki. In the presence of calcium ions and saturating concentrations of phospholipids and factor Va, the Ki and Ki* for factor Xa inactivation are 2.04 nM and 52.3 pM. The enhancing effect of heparin on the inhibitory process is concentration dependent and exhibits an optimum, reminiscent of the template model for heparin's acceleration of thrombin and factor IXa inhibition by antithrombin III. At optimal concentrations, the major mechanism of heparin action is also a reduction in the Ki of the initial encounter complex between factor Xa and rTFPI."
https://openalex.org/W2102328628,"All polyprenyl synthases catalyze the condensation of the allylic substrate, isopentenyl diphosphate, with a specific homoallylic diphosphate substrate. Polyprenyl synthases from Homo sapiens, Ratus rattus, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa, and Erwinia herbicola contain two conserved aspartate-rich (Ashby, M.N., and Edwards, P.A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 4128-4136). In order to determine the importance of these domains in catalysis, the conserved aspartates or arginines in domains I and II of rat farnesyl diphosphate synthase were individually mutated to glutamate or lysine, respectively. The putative active site arginine (Brems, D.N., Breunger, E., and Rilling, H. C. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 3711-3718) was mutated to lysine. Each mutant enzyme was overexpressed in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. Detailed kinetic analyses of the wild type and mutant enzymes indicated that mutagenesis of Asp104, Asp107, Arg112, Arg113, and Asp243 resulted in a decreased Vmax of approximately 1000-fold compared to wild type. However, no significant change in the Km values for either the isopentenyl diphosphate or geranyl diphosphate substrate were observed. The results strongly suggest that these amino acids, and to a lesser extent Asp244, are involved in either the condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate and geranyl diphosphate to form farnesyl diphosphate and/or the release of the farnesyl diphosphate product from farnesyl diphosphate synthase. The conservation of these amino acid residues in different enzymes from several species suggests that these domains play a similar role in other polyprenyl synthases."
https://openalex.org/W1565618785,"Recombinant vaccinia virus vectors were used to coexpress mouse prohormone convertase 1 (mPC1), mPC2, or human furin together with human proenkephalin in GH4C1 cells (rat pituitary somatomammotrophs) to examine the proteolytic processing of proenkephalin by these enzymes. Radioimmunoassays performed on high pressure gel permeation size-fractionated extracts obtained from GH4C1 cells and corresponding conditioned media revealed distinct profiles of immunoreactivity for products generated by each enzyme. PC1 produced intermediate sized processing products (3-10 kDa); the major immunoreactive enkephalin-containing species observed eluted at the positions of peptide B, the 5.3-kDa fragment, and free Leu5-enkephalin. PC2 exhibited a more complete processing profile. The major immunoreactive enkephalins produced were free Met5-enkephalin-Arg-Phe, free Met5-enkephalin-Arg-Gly-Leu, free Leu5-enkephalin, and free Met5-enkephalin. Thus PC2 appears to be more capable of generating active opioid units from proenkephalin than is PC1. Finally, furin cleaved proenkephalin to generate peptide B, an unidentified peak between the 18- and 5.3-kDa fragments, and a small amount of the 5.3-kDa fragment. Radiosequencing data verified that the production of the 5.3-kDa fragment by PC1 occurred as a result of a Lys-Lys cleavage. The ability of PC1 to cleave proenkephalin (but not proopiomelanocortin) at a Lys-Lys site implies that the structural context of the paired basic cleavage site may be more important in the determination of cleavage specificity than the particular pair of basic residues at the site."
https://openalex.org/W1603561844,"Rabphilin-3A is a putative target molecule for rab3A p25/smg p25A, which is a member of a ras p21-related small GTP-binding protein and implicated in neurotransmitter release from the synapse. Rabphilin-3A has two copies of an internal repeat that are homologous to the C2 domains of protein kinase C, synaptotagmin, and phospholipase A2, which are known to bind to phospholipid in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. In the current study, we have investigated the functional domains or rabphilin-3A by use of three recombinant proteins as follows: full rabphilin-3A (1-704 amino acids), an N-terminal fragment (1-280 amino acids), and a C-terminal fragment containing the C2 domains (281-704 amino acids). Both rabphilin-3A and the C-terminal fragment bound to phospholipid in the presence of Ca2+, but the N-terminal fragment did not bind to phospholipid. 45Ca2+ bound to rabphilin-3A and the C-terminal fragment only in the presence of phospholipid but did not bind to the N-terminal fragment. The GTP gamma S-bound form of rab3A p25 bound to both rabphilin-3A and the N-terminal fragment but did not bind to the C-terminal fragment. These results indicate that rabphilin-3A has at least two functionally different domains, the N-terminal rab3A p25-binding and C-terminal phospholipid- and Ca(2+)-binding domains."
https://openalex.org/W1567178433,"The presence of a CACGTG element within a region of the human ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) promoter located at -491 to -474 base pairs 5' to the start site of transcription suggested that the c-Myc.Max protein complex may play a role in the regulation of ODC expression during growth. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and methylation interference analysis showed that the nuclei of WI-38 cells expressing ODC contained proteins that bound to this region of the ODC gene in a manner that correlated with growth-associated ODC expression. Also, use of antibodies against c-Myc and Max and purified recombinant c-Myc and Max protein in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed that these proteins can specifically bind this portion of the human ODC promoter. Transient transfection studies showed that increase in the level of c-Myc and/or Max led to a significant enhancement of expression of a human ODC promoter-CAT reporter construct. Moreover, treatment of actively growing WI-38 cells with an antisense oligomer to c-Myc reduced the amount of endogenous protein complex formed and the amount of endogenous ODC mRNA expressed. These studies show that the c-Myc.Max protein complex plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of human ODC in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1540141309,"The -1389 to +588 region of the human genomic glutathione peroxidase gene (hgpx1) was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction. This DNA fragment was cloned and sequenced, and various deletion constructs derived from the hgpx1 5'-flanking region were fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. These reporter genes were analyzed in transient transfection assays using primary cultured human ventricular cardiomyocytes obtained from patients with tetralogy of Fallot. Two distinct regions upstream from the transcription start site, which was determined using S1 nuclease analysis, were identified to be responsive to the oxygen tension in culture (pO2 values of 150 or 40 mm Hg). Methylation interference footprinting assays revealed proteins closely apposed to two sequences located at -1232 to -1213 and -282 to -275. We have designated these oxygen responsive elements ORE1 and ORE2, respectively. Gel mobility shift assays using double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to each site have demonstrated the formation of specific complexes using both cultured human cardiomyocyte and HeLa nuclear extracts. ORE1 and ORE2 bind disparate proteins with equal precision as bound complexes could be competed away with identical sequences but not with either the other ORE or an unrelated sequence. Insertion of these oxygen responsive elements into a reporter gene governed by a SV40 promoter similarly regulated chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity according to the oxygen tension in culture."
https://openalex.org/W1525006850,"Abstract We have recently isolated a renal cDNA clone (rBAT) that induces amino acid transport in oocytes either as a component or as a specific activator of a system bo,(+)-like transporter. (Bertran, J., Werner, A., Moore, M. L., Stange, G., Markovich, D., Biber, J., Testar, X., Zorzano, A., Palacin, M., and Murer, H. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 5601-5605. In order to obtain additional information on the rBAT protein, we have investigated the cellular localization of rBAT and its expression during development in rat kidney. A polyclonal antibody raised against rBAT recognizes a specific protein band of approximately 90 kDa, which is highly enriched in rat renal brush border membranes. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy studies demonstrated that rBAT is expressed in the microvilli domain of S3 epithelial cells (i.e. straight tubules). The onset of rBAT mRNA expression in kidney was detected during late fetal life. In keeping with this, induction in oocytes of L-cystine uptake due to fetal rBAT-related mRNA was approximately 10% of the induction obtained with rBAT-related mRNA from adult kidneys. rBAT mRNA levels were low in early postnatal life, and only at the end of lactation did they increase steeply, attaining approximately 50% of adult values after weaning. rBAT protein was undetectable in total membrane preparations of kidneys from fetuses and early neonates, weakly detected during lactation, and represented < 15% of adult values after weaning. The postnatal expression of rBAT and its specific location in the microvilli of epithelial cells from the S3 segment of the proximal tubule coincide with postnatal maturation of cystine resorption and with the site of high affinity resorption of cysteine in kidney. This is consistent with the involvement of rBAT in a b(o,+)-like high-affinity resorption system for cysteine in the proximal straight tubule of the nephron."
https://openalex.org/W1583485085,"Single turnover and equilibrium binding measurements on the interaction of Gly-12 and Pro-12 Ras.GTP with the catalytic domains of the GTPase-activating proteins, p120-GAP and neurofibromin, have been made utilizing fluorescent 2'(3')O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-nucleotides. These have enabled the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for their initial binding and the rate constants of the hydrolysis step to be measured. p120-GAP binds to both Ras proteins with a Kd of 17 microM, whereas neurofibromin binds to both Ras proteins with a Kd of 1 microM. Both p120-GAP and neurofibromin increased the rate constant of the GTP hydrolysis step of Pro-12 Ras, but the maximal activation at 30 degrees C was 120-fold and 560-fold, as compared with 70,000- and 52,000-fold, with Gly-12 Ras. The affinity with which p120-GAP and neurofibromin binds to either Gly-12 or Pro-12 Ras protein was decreased dramatically by increasing ionic strength caused by addition of NaCl. The rate constant of the cleavage step of hydrolysis catalyzed by neurofibromin increases with increasing ionic strength, whereas that catalyzed by p120-GAP appears to be unaffected. The high ionic strength within the cell might result in a much lower overall GTPase-activating protein activity than is measured under conditions of low ionic strength in vitro, with p120-GAP being more severely inhibited. The GTP hydrolysis rate of Pro-12 Ras is 2-fold faster than that of normal Ras. The low oncogenicity of Pro-12 ras is explained by a model in which the intrinsic rates of hydrolysis and exchange, as well as GTPase-activating protein- and exchange factor-stimulated rates, are determinants of the biological activity of Ras proteins in fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1551633927,"Bovine factor Va inactivation by activated protein C (APC) was evaluated in the presence and absence of phospholipid vesicles and protein S. Following a 30-min incubation with APC (10 nM), membrane-bound factor Va (200 nM) is completely inactivated, whereas in the absence of phospholipid vesicles, after a 2-h incubation, the cofactor retains 60% of its initial cofactor activity. The complete loss of activity of membrane-bound factor Va is associated with the appearance of M(r) 40,000, 28,000, and 20,000 fragments derived from the heavy chain of the cofactor which correspond to cleavage at Arg306, Arg505, and Arg662. In the absence of a lipid bilayer, cleavage at Arg505 and Arg662 results in a cofactor with reduced activity. No difference is observed in the cleavage of the light chain of the cofactor by APC in the presence or absence of phospholipid vesicles. The rate of the cleavage of factor Va heavy chain at Arg306, Arg505, and Arg662 as well as the rate of the membrane-bound cofactor inactivation by APC were enhanced in the presence of protein S. Our data demonstrate that the anionic lipid-dependent cleavage of factor Va by APC at Arg306 is required for the complete inactivation of the cofactor."
https://openalex.org/W2110841019,"In populations of fura-2-loaded chromaffin cells, caffeine caused a concentration-dependent increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), in the presence or absence of external Ca2+ ([Ca2+]o), that was saturable, reversible, and inhibited in a use-dependent fashion by ryanodine. These data confirm that caffeine mobilizes Ca2+ from the ryanodine-sensitive intracellular stores in chromaffin cells. In nominally Ca(2+)-free medium, sustained stimulation of cell populations or single cells with low caffeine concentrations failed to completely empty the caffeine-sensitive stores. In each case, there was a transient [Ca2+]i elevation, but a subsequent challenge with a higher caffeine concentration evoked a further [Ca2+]i rise, indicating that Ca2+ stores within individual cells were heterogeneous in their sensitivities to caffeine and that caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was quantal. The heterogeneous sensitivity was also demonstrated using ryanodine; pretreatment of cell populations with increasing caffeine concentrations with a constant ryanodine concentration, caused a dose-dependent irreversible inhibition of the response to the subsequent addition of a maximal caffeine concentration. We conclude that, within single chromaffin cells, intracellular Ca2+ stores are heterogeneous in their sensitivity to caffeine and the fraction of Ca2+ stores mobilized by caffeine increases in direct proportion to the caffeine concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1540212359,"Yeast fatty acid synthase consists of two independent polypeptide strains, alpha and beta. The functional multienzyme complex, composed of six alpha- and six beta-subunits, is rather stable against proteolysis in vivo. Mutations in one of the subunits or deletion of one subunit lead to degradation of the nonmutated remaining fatty acid synthase protein. We show that the unassembled alpha-subunit of this enzyme is short-lived, and degradation depends on the presence of active cytoplasmic proteinase yscE, the yeast proteasome. The unassembled beta-subunit is degraded by a nonvacuolar proteolytic system under vegetative growth conditions. However, starvation of a vacuolar proteinase mutant strain, which lacks the alpha-subunit of fatty acid synthase, leads to appearance of the unassembled beta-subunit is isolated vacuoles. This indicates that the major vacuolar peptidases proteinase yscA and yscB are at least partly involved in degradation of the beta-subunit of fatty acid synthase. In a proteinase yscA and yscB double mutant strain wild type for fatty acid synthase both subunits of fatty acid synthase, alpha and beta, are detectable in vacuoles. In addition, under the same starvation conditions other cytoplasmic proteins are found in the vacuole of a proteinase yscA and yscB double mutant strain. The experiments in conjunction with the previous finding of the appearance of vesicles in vacuoles of starved cells (Simeon, A., van der Klei, I.J., Veenhuis, M., and Wolf, D. H. (1992) FEBS Lett. 301, 231-235) indicate that transport of these tested cytoplasmic proteins into the vacuole is an unselective bulk process induced by nutritional stress."
https://openalex.org/W1574162466,"The cellulase complexes of two cellulolytic bacteria, Clostridium thermocellum and Bacteroides cellulosolvens, were subjected to extensive Pronase digestion. Glycopeptide fractions were isolated by gel permeation and fast protein liquid chromatography and analyzed by monosaccharide analysis, amino acid analysis, methylation analysis, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Alkaline borohydride-induced deglycosylation/amino acid conversion and periodate oxidation studies on the glycopeptide fraction of the C. thermocellum cellulosome demonstrated that the earlier established collection of carbohydrate moieties with 3-O-Me-D-GlcpNAc-alpha (1-->2)-[D-Galp-alpha (1-->3)]-D-Galf-alpha (1-->2)-D-Gal (where 3-O-Me-D-GlcpNAc is 3-O-methyl-N-acetylglucopyranosamine, Galp is galactopyranose, and Galf is galactofuranose) as the major component, is O-linked to threonine via galactopyranose. Using the same approach for the glycopeptide fraction of the cellulase complex of B. cellulosolvens, it was found that the reported collection of carbohydrate moieties with D-Galf-alpha (1-->3)-D-GlcpNAc-alpha (1-->2)-D-Galf-alpha (1-->2)-[D-Galf-beta (1-->3)]-D-Gal as the major component, is O-linked mainly to threonine and partly to serine via galactopyranose. In both species, the hydroxyamino-acid-bound galactopyranose residue has probably an alpha-configuration. The carbohydrate chains appear as clusters located in highly Thr/Pro-rich peptide regions of the glycoproteins. The results are consistent with the notion that the glycosylation sites are localized in linker sequences which connect the various binding domains of the noncatalytic S1 subunit of the cellulosome."
https://openalex.org/W1567098607,"S-Lac lectins are a family of soluble lactose-binding animal lectins, some of which have been implicated in modulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions through specific carbohydrate-mediated recognition. We report here the x-ray crystal structure of a representative member of this family, the human dimeric S-Lac lectin, L-14-II, in complex with lactose, at 2.9-A resolution. The two-fold symmetric dimer is made up of two extended anti-parallel beta-sheets, which associate in a beta-sandwich motif. Remarkably, the L-14-II monomer shares not only the same topology, but a very similar beta-sheet structure with that of the leguminous plant lectins, suggesting a conserved structure-function relationship. Carbohydrate binding by L-14-II was found to involve protein residues that are very highly conserved among all S-Lac lectins. These residues map to a single DNA exon, suggesting a carbohydrate binding cassette common to all S-Lac lectins."
https://openalex.org/W1607395669,"GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) modulate the activity of the ras superfamily of proteins by converting active GTP-bound to inactive GDP-bound p21s. Employing a novel GAP overlay assay (Manser, E., Leung, T., Monfries, C., Teo, M., Hall, C., and Lim, L. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16025-16028), we demonstrated a diversity of proteins with GAP activities in different tissues. Using a polymerase chain reaction strategy exploiting conserved residues in the GAP domains of n-chimaerin and the product of the breakpoint cluster region gene (BCR), we isolated a human brain 5.3-kilobase cDNA containing a 486-base pair region with complete identity to a previously reported active BCR-related (ABR) gene sequence on human chromosome 17. The brain cDNA encoded a 98-kDa protein (ABR) resembling BCR (68% identity), containing both the oncogene dbl-related domain at the N terminus and the GAP domain at the C terminus; however, it lacks the N-terminal BCR protein kinase domain. The ABR GAP domain expressed as an Escherichia coli fusion protein was active against Rac1 and Cdc42 of the rho subfamily. The ABR mRNA is highly enriched in the brain. ABR probably corresponds to the brain-enriched 100-kDa GAP for Rac and Cdc42Hs previously detected. The relationship of ABR to Miller-Dieker syndrome, a neurological disorder co-mapping to 17p13.3, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1530517085,"DNA polymerase exonucleolytic proofreading is important in attaining high fidelity DNA replication. One of the most well characterized proofreading activities is the 3'-->5'-exonuclease activity of bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase. We have used genetic analyses and protein sequence comparisons to Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I to identify amino acids in the N-terminal region of T4 DNA polymerase that are required for exonucleolytic proofreading. Mutant DNA polymerases with amino acid substitutions D112A/E114A, D219A, or D324A reduced 3'-->5'-exonuclease activity 10(2)-10(4)-fold in various in vitro assays and decreased DNA replication fidelity in vivo. DNA replication activity was also reduced for the exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerases in vitro and in vivo. Reduction in DNA replication appeared to be due primarily to the interdependence of T4 DNA polymerase replication and proofreading activities; T4 DNA polymerase requires 3'-->5'-exonuclease activity to repair primer termini that are not suitable substrates for extension. Observations reported here provide further evidence in support of the proposal that DNA polymerases have distinct 3'-->5'-exonuclease and polymerase active sites."
https://openalex.org/W1608534752,"To elucidate the functional role of the lysyl residue highly conserved in NAD(P)(+)-dependent amino acid dehydrogenases, Lys-80 of leucine dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been mutated into Ala, Arg, or Gln. All of the mutant enzymes had markedly reduced activities in the oxidative deamination, whereas the Michaelis constants for substrate and coenzyme did not change significantly upon the mutation, except for a 10-30-fold increase in Km values for alpha-keto-iso-caproate in the Ala and Gln mutants. The pH profiles of kinetic parameters of the mutants considerably differed from those of the wild type, in which two ionizable groups with pKa values of 8.9 and 10.7 must be unprotonated for catalysis and protonated for substrate binding, respectively. Combined with the analyses of solvent isotope effect and inhibition by substrate analogs, these results unequivocally show that the epsilon-amino group of Lys-80 participates in catalysis as a general base, assisting the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule to the substrate alpha-carbon atom. Furthermore, the Ala mutant was markedly stimulated by primary amines depending on the pKa and molecular volume, suggesting that in the Ala mutant the added amines can partially replace the general base function of Lys-80 in the wild type enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1562376100,"Pinoresinol/lariciresinol reductase catalyzes the first known example of a highly unusual benzylic ether reduction in plants; its mechanism of hydride transfer is described. The enzyme was found in Forsythia intermedia and catalyzes the presumed regulatory branch-points in the pathway leading to benzylaryltetrahydrofuran, dibenzylbutane, dibenzylbutyrolactone, and aryltetrahydronaphthalene lignans. Using [7,7'-2H2]-pinoresinol and [7,7'-2H3]lariciresinol as substrates, the hydride transfers of the highly unusual reductase were demonstrated to be completely stereospecific (> 99%). The incoming hydrides were found to take up the pro-R position at C-7' (and/or C-7) in lariciresinol and secoisolariciresinol, thereby eliminating the possibility of random hydride delivery to a planar quinone methide intermediate. As might be expected, the mode of hydride abstraction from NADPH was also stereospecific: using [4R-3H] and [4S-3H]NADPH, it was found that only the 4 pro-R hydrogen was abstracted for enzymatic hydride transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1594337634,"The helicase and primase activities of bacteriophage T7 are distributed between the 56- and 63-kDa gene 4 proteins. The 63-kDa protein catalyzes both helicase and primase activities. The 56-kDa gene 4 protein lacks the 63 amino acids at the N terminus of the colinear 63-kDa protein and catalyzes only helicase activity. Helicase activity is dependent on the hydrolysis of a nucleoside 5'-triphosphate. Sequence analysis reveals a single A-type nucleoside 5'-triphosphate binding site near the center of each gene 4 protein. We have examined the essential role of nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis both in vivo and in vitro by using site-directed mutagenesis to alter the conserved, adjacent Gly and Lys residues within this nucleotide binding site. The mutant gene 4 proteins, expressed from plasmids carrying the cloned genes, do not complement a T7 phage lacking gene 4. Moreover, the mutations are dominant-lethal: they block productive infection by wild-type T7 phage. A nucleotide binding site mutant 56-kDa gene 4 protein, purified to homogeneity from cells over-expressing the gene, binds but lacks the ability to hydrolyze nucleotides and cannot bind to single-stranded DNA. Consequently, this mutant gene 4 protein also lacks helicase activity. The mutant gene 4 proteins inhibit the nucleotide hydrolysis activity of wild-type gene 4 proteins in a stoichiometric manner. The apparent inhibition constant (Ki = 22 +/- 4.5 nM) of this interaction may reflect the gene 4 oligomer dissociation constant in the presence of nucleotide and single-stranded DNA. Analysis of the inhibition reaction indicates that this is a linear mixed-type inhibition, indicating that the mutant protein binds the wild-type protein to form an inactive complex on single-stranded DNA. Furthermore, the mutant 56-kDa gene 4 protein has the same affinity for both the wild-type 63- and 56-kDa gene 4 proteins, suggesting that there is no preference for the formation of homo-oligomeric complexes. The ability of the mutant proteins to inhibit the activity of the wild-type gene 4 proteins indicates that nucleotide hydrolysis is coordinated and cooperative among the members of the gene 4 protein complex as it binds and translocates on single-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2145278725,"The bacteriophage PBS2 uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor (Ugi) inactivates Escherichia coli uracil-DNA glycosylase (Ung) by forming an Ung.Ugi protein complex with 1:1 stoichiometry. Stability of the Ung.Ugi complex was demonstrated by the inability of free Ugi to exchange with Ugi bound in preformed complex. Ung was reacted with fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate to produce fluorescent-Ung (F-Ung), which retained full uracil-DNA glycosylase activity and susceptibility to Ugi inactivation. Addition of Ugi to F-Ung under steady-state conditions resulted in saturable (15%) fluorescence quenching at a F-Ung.Ugi ratio of 1:1.4. Dissociation constants determined for the F-Ung interaction with M13 DNA, uracil-containing DNA, and poly(U) equaled 600, 220, and 190 microM, respectively. While F-Ung associated with nucleic acid polymers was able to bind Ugi efficiently, F-Ung bound in the F-Ung.Ugi complex could no longer effectively bind nucleic acid. Stopped-flow kinetic analysis suggested the F-Ung/Ugi association was described by a two-step mechanism. The first step entailed a rapid pre-equilibrium distinguished by the dissociation constant Kd = 1.3 microM. The second step led irreversibly to the formation of the final complex and was characterized by the rate constant k = 195 s-1. We infer Ugi inactivates Ung through the formation of an exceptionally stable protein-protein complex."
https://openalex.org/W1492410406,"Retinol bound to cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP) was found to be oxidized to retinoic acid by a soluble activity from calf liver. Cytosolic retinoic acid synthesis from retinol-CRBP was strictly dependent on the exogenous supply of either NAD or NADP. NAD-supported reactions carried out in the presence or in the absence of dimethyl sulfoxide yielded apparent Km and Vmax values for the retinol-CRBP complex of 3.5 +/- 0.6 microM, 611 +/- 49 pmol h-1 (mg of protein)-1, and 0.84 +/- 0.12 microM, 601 +/- 38 pmol h-1 (mg of protein)-1, respectively. The corresponding values for the oxidation of free retinol, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, were 7.1 +/- 0.3 microM and 948 +/- 47 pmol h-1 (mg of protein)-1. Since the dissociation constant of the bovine retinol-CRBP complex is less than 10(-8) M, whereas the Km for retinol-CRBP is of the same order as the Km for free retinol, synthesis of retinoic acid from retinol-CRBP does not rely on prior dissociation of retinol. ApoCRBP proved to be a specific inhibitor of retinoic acid synthesis from CRBP-bound retinol. Its inhibitory effect was indistinguishable from the dilution of the radioactive retinol-CRBP substrate that was obtained by the addition of unlabeled holoCRBP. In contrast, the oxidation of CRBP-bound retinol was not inhibited by the addition of other retinoid binding proteins nor by the addition of either free retinol or retinol complexed with proteins distinct from CRBP. These results indicate that the protein moiety of holoCRBP is specifically recognized by the cytosolic enzyme system that catalyzes retinoic acid synthesis from CRBP-bound retinol."
https://openalex.org/W1589326884,"Plants convert lipid-bound cis-n-9 monoenoic to polyenoic fatty acid residues without involvement of corresponding CoA-thioesters. To provide additional evidence for this type of lipid-linked desaturation we incubated sn-1-O- and 2-O-(cis-9)octadecenylglycerol isomers with photoautotrophic cell cultures from tomato. After 14 days the fractions of phosphatidylcholine and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol were isolated and the incorporated glycerol ether backbones released by treatment with LiAlH4 (reduction of ester bonds) and short acid hydrolysis (cleavage of enol ether bonds). High performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy of the products in appropriately derivatized form showed that the (cis-9)octadecenyl group in the sn-1 position of the phospholipid was nearly completely desaturated to a (cis-9,12)octadecadienyl residue having the same double bond arrangement as linoleic acid. In the galactolipid fraction the desaturation had progressed to octadecatrienyl residues. Similarly, the octadecenyl residue in the sn-2 position of the phospholipid was nearly completely desaturated to an octadecadienyl group. These results are unambiguous proof for lipid-linked desaturation by both microsomal and plastidial desaturase systems of plants."
https://openalex.org/W1480097114,"A region of the plasmid RK2 has been shown to stabilize plasmid replicons in a broad host-range manner. This region encodes two divergently transcribed operons: parCBA and parDE. The parCBA operon specifies a multimer resolution system, while the parDE operon alone is capable of stabilizing an RK2-derived minireplicon under defined growth conditions in several different Gram-negative bacteria. The observed autoregulation of the parDE operon is most likely the result of ParD protein binding within the PparDE region. The characteristics of ParD binding to this region and the role of such binding in plasmid stabilization were examined with purified ParD protein. The results indicate that the binding of a single dimer of ParD protein to the promoter region most likely blocks interaction of RNA polymerase holoenzyme with the promoter. DNase I protection experiments indicate that ParD binds to a discrete sequence of 48 base pairs in length. While the binding of ParD to PparDE is essential for proper regulation of expression of the ParD and ParE proteins in vivo, the analyses of binding properties of mutant ParD proteins suggest that binding to this region does not play a direct role in plasmid stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W1545929915,"The M-->N transition in the photocycle of bacteriorhodopsin involves the transfer of a proton from Asp96 to the retinylidene Schiff base, possibly through a network of hydrogen-bonded amino acid residues and water molecules (Rothschild, K. J., He, Y. W., Sonar, S., Marti, T., and Khorana, H. G. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 1615-1622). A conformational change of the protein backbone is also observed during this transition. In this work, we have investigated the effects of replacing the residue Thr46, which might be part of this chain, with an aspartic acid. Both Fourier transform infrared and resonance Raman spectroscopy show that the chromophore structure of this mutant (T46D) is normal. However, N formation is accelerated and N decay is significantly slowed compared to wild-type bacteriorhodopsin. This effect causes the N intermediate to accumulate under steady-state illumination thereby facilitating spectroscopic studies under normal pH conditions. Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy reveals that like native bacteriorhodopsin, N formation in T46D involves deprotonation of Asp96, reprotonation of the Schiff base, and a change in the backbone secondary structure. However, in contrast to bacteriorhodopsin, bands assigned to the C = O stretch mode of the carboxylic acid group of Asp96 are upshifted by 10 cm-1 reflecting a change in the Asp96 environment and a drop in its effective pKa throughout the photocycle. This change in the pKa can directly account for changes in the photocycle kinetics and indicates that Asp96 deprotonation/protonation are the rate limiting steps in the formation and decay of the N intermediate. By studying the effects of H/D exchange, evidence is found that the backbone structural changes involve transmembrane alpha-helices. It is proposed that these structural changes serve to modulate the local environment and protonation state of Asp96 during the photocycle and are also essential for formation of the proton conducting hydrogen bonded network which functions during Schiff base reprotonation."
https://openalex.org/W1550734176,"The androgen-regulated 20-kDa protein gene consists of four exons that code for a major secretory protein of rat ventral prostate. Analysis of its potential cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements revealed that a large intron 1 region (In-1) had stronger androgen response element (ARE) activity than did the 5'-flanking DNA. In cotransfected CV1 cells, In-1 and its most active subfragment In-1c functioned as AREs but not glucocorticoid response elements (GRE). Nevertheless several ARE/GRE-like partial palindromic sequences are present in In-1c, and it bound both androgen receptors and glucocorticoid receptors in mobility shift assays. A cluster of three ARE/GRE-like sequences contained within a 39-base pair sequence of In-1c had both ARE and GRE activities when analyzed as an isolated oligonucleotide, suggesting that other elements within In-1c determined its ARE specificity. In addition to ARE/GRE-like sequences, In-1c contains putative response elements for the transcription factors AP1, CREB, AP2, OCT-1, C/EBP, and a number of inverted and direct repeats. The ARE specificity of In-1c observed in CV1 cells was diminished in PC3 and HeLa cells transiently cotransfected with an androgen receptor or glucocorticoid receptor expression vector together with an In-1c reporter vector; however, the ARE activity of In-1c was greater than its GRE activity in these cell lines. Interestingly, a 131-base pair subfragment of In-1c retained ARE specificity in all three cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1604223977,"Abstract The mannose transporter of the bacterial phosphotransferase system consists of two transmembrane subunits (IICMan and IIDMan) and a hydrophilic subunit (IIABMan). IIABMan has two flexibly linked domains containing one phosphorylation site each and occurs as a dimer. Substrate transport is coupled to phosphorylation. The phosphoryl group is transferred from a phosphoryl carrier protein to His10 on IIA, hence to His175 on IIB and finally to the substrate. IIABMan mutants were analyzed in vitro for complementation, negative dominance, cysteine cross-linking and reactivity. Conclusions: (i) His10, Trp12, Lys48, and Ser72 form a functional unit (phosphorylation site 1); (ii) His86 on the IIA domain and His175 on the IIB domain of the same subunit form a functional unit (phosphorylation site 2); (iii) phosphoryl transfer can occur between His10 and His175 of the same as well as of different subunits and His86 is necessary for this transfer; (iv) the subunits in the dimer are interdependent; (v) The phosphorylation site mutant H175C is highly reactive toward thiol reagents and it forms extensive homo- and heterocross-links with other surface-exposed cysteines. The phosphorylation site mutant H10C is 1000-fold less reactive. The two residues might be in complementary locations, His10 buried in a concave, His175 exposed on a convex surface."
https://openalex.org/W1590372519,"To analyze the mechanism of the cell type-specific expression of rat angiotensin II type 1a receptor (AT1a-R) gene, we isolated the 5'-portion of the gene and identified multiple positive and negative regulatory sequences that regulate its transcription. Primer extension and S1 mapping identified a transcriptional initiation site at 33 (position +1) base pairs (bp) downstream of TATA sequence. The transcriptional activities of various 5'-deletion mutants of the AT1a-R gene upstream region, fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, were examined using rat vascular smooth muscle cells (A10) and glial cells expressing AT1a-R mRNA predominantly or PC12 cells expressing AT2-R and very small amounts of AT1a-R mRNA. A 980-bp 5'-flanking sequence contained at least three positive elements, P1 (-560 to -489), P2 (-331 to -201), and P3 (-201 to -61). P1 and P3 were active in the tested three cells, and P2 was functional only in glial and PC12 cells. In addition to these positive elements, there was negative element, N1 (-489 to -331), which was active only in PC12 cells. These elements, when cotransfected with the AT1a-CAT fusion gene, had competitive effects against its promoter activity. The present study suggests the presence of multiple trans-acting factors that act on these positive and negative cis-acting elements and regulate the cell type-specific expression of the rat AT1a-R gene."
https://openalex.org/W1490990707,"Membrane immunoglobulins (mIg) serve as the recognition components of B lymphocyte antigen receptors. Binding of antigen to these receptors leads to dramatic effects on B cell growth and viability. We have examined the structural elements of mIgM that are involved in antigen receptor assembly and function. Expression of transfected wild-type mIgM in a B cell line led to assembly with the other two known components of the antigen receptor, Ig-alpha and Ig-beta, expression on the cell surface, and when cross-linked by anti-IgM antibodies, stimulation of signal transductin reactions, including tyrosine protein phosphorylation, inositol phosphate production, and increases in cytoplasmic calcium concentration. Replacement of the highly conserved COOH-terminal 41 amino acids of mIgM heavy chain (mu m) with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of human CD8 alpha resulted in a molecule which was expressed on the B cell surface at levels comparable to wild-type mIgM, but which did not form a complex with Ig-alpha or Ig-beta and did not stimulate any of the signaling reactions mentioned above. Replacement of the basic three-amino-acid cytoplasmic domain of mu m with a different but similarly charged sequence had no effect on cell-surface expression or signaling function. On the other hand, removal of the entire cytoplasmic domain resulted in a molecule which did not bind Ig-alpha and Ig-beta and which did not transduce signals. This effect is probably due to altered post-translational processing of this mutant molecule. Finally, a series of eight single-amino-acid substitutions in the transmembrane domain was constructed. Most of these resulted in the removal of hydroxyl groups from conserved residues postulated to be important for interactions with other components. Each of these mutant molecules was capable of transducing signals when cross-linked by anti-IgM, but one was partially defective. Since alteration of any single residue was not sufficient to disrupt signaling completely, the interactions required for signaling are likely to involve multiple residues, so that elimination of one hydroxyl group does not prevent the interaction. We propose that the cytoplasmic domain of mu m does not play a critical role in receptor function but that the transmembrane domain specifies interactions with other components, probably Ig-alpha and Ig-beta, required for proper antigen receptor signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1592937675,"The alkenyl and aromatic glucosinolates in oilseed rape (Brassica napus) are biosynthesized from chain-extended homologues of protein amino acids, including methionine and phenylalanine. Homologues of these two amino acids, homophenylalanine (2-amino-4-phenylbutyric acid) and dihomomethionine (2-amino-6-methylthiohexanoic acid) were synthesized both with and without a 1-14C label. Microsomal preparations from oilseed rape leaves were shown to contain enzyme systems which metabolize these compounds, with loss of 14CO2, and produce the aldoxime intermediates possible in the biosynthetic pathway utilizing homophenylalanine. These were characterized by comparison with authenticated synthetic compounds. Potential intermediates on the pathway between homophenylalanine and its corresponding aldoxime, the N-hydroxyamino- and the oximino acids, were synthesized and their possible role in the pathway investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1654738121,"A new DNA polymerase activity was identified and purified to near homogeneity from extracts of mitotic and meiotic cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This activity increased at least 5-fold during meiosis, and it was shown to be associated with a 68-kDa polypeptide as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This new DNA polymerase did not have any detectable 3'-->5' exonuclease activity and preferred small gapped DNA as a template-primer. The activity was inhibited by dideoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates and N-ethylmaleimide but not by concentrations of aphidicolin which completely inhibit either DNA polymerases I (alpha), II (epsilon), or III (delta). Since no polypeptide(s) in the extensively purified DNA polymerase fractions cross-reacted with antibodies raised against yeast DNA polymerases I, II, and III, we called this enzyme DNA polymerase IV. The DNA polymerase IV activity increased at least 10-fold in a yeast strain overexpressing the gene product predicted from the YCR14C open-reading frame (identified on S. cerevisiae chromosome III and provisionally called POLX), while no activity was detected in a strain where POLX was deleted. These results strongly suggest that DNA polymerase IV is encoded by the POLX gene and is a probable homolog of mammalian DNA polymerase beta."
https://openalex.org/W1546263121,"Gene 4 of bacteriophage T7 encodes two co-linear proteins, the 56- and 63-kDa gene 4 proteins. The 56-kDa protein translocates 5' to 3' on single-stranded DNA using nucleotide hydrolysis for energy and is a helicase. The 63-kDa gene 4 protein catalyzes all of the activities of the 56-kDa gene 4 protein and, in addition, catalyzes the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides on single-stranded DNA. Two conserved residues in a putative nucleotide binding site of the 63-kDa gene 4 protein were mutated by substituting Val and Met for wild-type residues Gly and Lys, at positions 317 and 318, respectively. The mutant 63-kDa gene 4 protein lacks the ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of a nucleoside 5'-triphosphate in a single-stranded DNA-dependent reaction and inhibits nucleotide hydrolysis by wild-type gene 4 proteins. The mutant primase contains 0.4% of the primase activity of the 63-kDa gene 4 protein on M13 single-stranded DNA and 12% of the wild-type primase activity on an oligonucleotide with a single primase recognition site. Addition of wild-type 56-kDa gene 4 protein stimulates the mutant primase activity over 50-fold on M13 single-stranded DNA and 8-fold on oligonucleotides. This increase in primase activity correlates with an increase in the affinity of the mutant primase-wild-type helicase complex for single-stranded DNA template."
https://openalex.org/W1651947609,"The cytochrome bo complex is a terminal ubiquinol oxidase in the aerobic respiratory chain of Escherichia coli and is encoded by the cyoABCDE operon. Recently, we have demonstrated that heme O at the high-spin heme-binding site is essential for redox-coupled proton pumping by the oxidase and suggested that the cyoE gene encodes a novel enzyme for heme O biosynthesis, protoheme IX farnesyltransferase (heme O synthase) (Saiki, K., Mogi, T., and Anraku, Y. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 189, 1491-1497). This study was focused to define the catalytic domain(s) of the CyoE protein via a site-directed mutagenesis approach. We have individually substituted 40 amino acid residues including 22 invariant residues with alanines and found that 23 mutant oxidases were nonfunctional and exhibited a specific loss of the CO binding activity at the site of the high-spin heme. Characterizations of the purified D65A, Y120A, and W172A mutant oxidases, which represent the mutations of different topological domains, revealed that their defects are attributable to substitution of protoheme IX for heme O present in the high-spin heme-binding site. Based on the above observations, we suggest that the conserved amino acid residues present in the cytoplasmic loops II/III and IV/V are part of the catalytic center of heme O synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1537305348,"N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) inhibited transiently the entry of Ca2+ and Mn2+ induced by emptying with thapsigargin the Ca2+ stores of HL60 cells differentiated toward granulocytes. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) produced a permanent inhibition of this store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway (SOCP), suggesting that inhibition was due to protein phosphorylation mediated by protein kinase C (PKC). Inhibition by PDB was prevented by the PKC inhibitors staurosporin and chelerythrine. Inhibition by fMLP was prevented by chelerythrine but only partially by staurosporin. The characteristics of the inhibition were similar to those reported in human neutrophils (Montero, M., Alvarez, J., and Garcia-Sancho, J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 13055-13061). Neither fMLP nor PDB inhibited significantly SOCP in undifferentiated HL60 cells. Single-cell [Ca2+]i measurements at different stages of differentiation showed that inhibition by fMLP and PDB developed independently, suggesting different inhibitory mechanisms. The simplest explanation would be that inhibition by fMLP takes place through activation of a protein kinase distinct from PKC and that the PDB-activated PKC isoform necessary to phosphorylate and inhibit SOCP is expressed only along differentiation. Additionally, inhibition by both fMLP and PDB developed gradually. At intermediate stages of differentiation, PDB was able to produce a partial and maintained inhibition and fMLP a partial and short-lived inhibition of SOCP."
https://openalex.org/W1669077057,"The GTP cyclohydrolase I gene of Drosophila melanogaster, the Punch locus, encodes alternative transcripts of 1.7 and 1.75 kilobases (kb). These transcripts are differentially expressed throughout Drosophila development. cDNA clones representing these transcripts, corresponding genomic regions and polymerase chain reaction-amplified primer extensions of the 5' ends of the RNAs were sequenced. Both RNAs contain five exons and derive from primary transcripts that extend over approximately 8 and 4 kb for the 1.7- and 1.75-kb RNAs, respectively. Their 5'-most exons are unique and spliced onto common 3' exons. The cDNAs each contain a single long open reading frame, which can be translated into a polypeptide of 273 amino acids for the 1.7-kb mRNA and 308 amino acids for the 1.75-kb mRNA. The unique exons confer distinct N-terminal domains to each predicted protein. Sequence comparisons reveal that the Drosophila GTP cyclohydrolase isoforms encoded by the multiple transcripts are highly similar to GTP cyclohydrolases from humans, rodents, and bacteria, with one significant exception. The N-terminal domains encoded by the transcript-specific 5' exons cannot be aligned with the N termini of any other GTP cyclohydrolases. These domains are predicted to confer distinct physical characteristics to the alternate isoforms, and it is hypothesized that they aid in regulating the expression of the enzyme in diverse cellular environments."
https://openalex.org/W1575577551,"Abstract In vivo gene transfer into various organs of postnatal animals has recently been demonstrated. We applied this technique in order to map the promoter element of the protooncogene c-fos in the myocardium that responds to left ventricular pressure overload in vivo. Beating rat hearts were directly injected with a recombinant plasmid containing a 356-base pair upstream regulatory element of the mouse c-fos gene fused to a reporter gene. Two days after the injection, the hearts were excised and buffer-perfused. Acute pressure overload was applied for 2 h by inflating an intraventricular balloon. Pressure overload increased the myocardial reporter gene activity by 3-8-fold (p < 0.01). Deletion and point mutations in the serum response element (SRE) of the c-fos promoter resulted in loss of pressure-induced reporter gene expression, indicating that the SRE is necessary for pressure response. The SRE alone was sufficient to confer pressure responsiveness to the minimal c-fos promoter, confirming that the pressure response element coincides with the SRE. A construct containing a point mutation at the p62TCF binding site of the SRE did not respond to pressure overload or to a protein kinase C activator but retained responsiveness to a calcium ionophore. This suggests that pressure overload may activate the c-fos promoter by a protein kinase C-dependent pathway. Thus, a directly injected gene can be regulated in the host cells by a physical stimulus to the intact organ. The in vivo DNA injection technique is a useful method to study complex organ physiology at the molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W1591802672,"A labile selenium donor compound, selenophosphate, is formed from selenide and ATP by selenophosphate synthetase. A cysteine residue (Cys-17) that is essential for catalytic activity of the enzyme (Kim, I.Y., Veres, Z., and Stadtman, T. C. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 19650-19654) is located in a glycine-rich segment near the N terminus of the protein. The possibility that this peptide sequence (HGAGCGCK) defines the ATP-binding site of the enzyme, as does a conserved ATP or GTP binding sequence (GXXXXGKS/T) found in several other proteins, was tested by site-specific mutagenesis. Thus His-13 and Gly-18 were changed to Asn and Val, respectively, and Lys-20 to Arg or Gln. Catalytic activity was markedly decreased by mutation of Lys-20 to Arg and abolished by mutation of Lys-20 to Gln. The mutation of Cys-19 and His-13 did not substantially alter the ATP Km and Vmax values, whereas the Gly-18 mutation resulted in a 4-fold increase in the ATP Km value compared with that of the wild type. ATP binding properties of the mutant enzymes were determined using Mn-[32P]ATP or Mn-[14C]ATP and gel filtration. Photoaffinity labeling of the proteins with [gamma-32P]8-azido-ATP showed that all mutant enzymes could be labeled with the ATP analog except those in which Cys-17 or Cys-19 were replaced with serine."

This enzyme has been purified to about 125,000-fold with a 0.2% yield from calf serum. The purification was achieved by ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose, DEAE-Toyopearl, SP-Toyopearl, Sephacryl S-200, AF-Blue-Toyopearl, and Mono Q columns. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a single band corresponding to an apparent M(r) of 70,000. This component was specifically photoaffinity-labeled with 4-thiouridine diphosphate. Exoglycosidase digestion and methylation analysis of the reaction products demonstrated that the enzyme catalyzed the transfer of one N-acetylglucosamine to position C-3 of the terminal galactosyl residue of lactose or N-acetyllactosamine in the beta linkage. The enzyme required Mn2+ ions for its activity and showed a broad pH optimum around 7.0. Apparent Km values for lactose, N-acetyllactosamine, and UDP-GlcNAc were 18.2, 19.6, and 0.129 mM, respectively. Acceptor specificity was tested using several oligosaccharides. The results indicated that terminal Gal beta 1-4Glc(NAc) sequences (type II chains) were preferred substrates for the enzyme. Terminal Gal beta 1-3GlcNAc sequences (type I chains), Lewis X trisaccharides (Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc), and monosaccharides (galactose) did not serve as substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1561253970,"A host-inducible lacZ fusion was mapped down-stream of the nodYABCSUIJ operon in Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain USDA110. Sequencing of this region identified three novel genes, nolMNO. RNA dot blot analysis showed that nolO transcription is nodD1-dependent and that a polar mutation in nodS, located 5 kilobases upstream of nolO, blocks the transcription of nolO. Coupled with the host-inducible nature of nolO expression, these results indicate that nolMNO are part of a 9-kilobase operon, nodYABCSUIJnolMNO. The lipo-oligosaccharide nodulation signals produced by strains SL67 (nolO-) and SL65(nolNO-) were purified, and their chemical structures were determined. In addition to the wild-type signal molecules, both mutants produced modified compounds that are not produced by the parent strain USDA110. The most prevalent difference observed was the absence of the 2-O-methylfucosyl residue from the mutant structures. In addition, metabolites were found in which the N-acetylglucosamine residue at the reducing end was glycosidically linked to glycerol. These alterations in the profiles of nodulation signals produced by strains SL67 and SL65 were accompanied by reduced nodulation efficiency on all hosts tested."
https://openalex.org/W2140918723,"Previous studies had indicated that recombinant and natural human sickle hemoglobin had similar chemical properties (Martin de Llano, J. J., Schneewind, O., Stetler, G., and Manning, J. M. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 918-922). In the present study, additional biochemical and physiological characterization of some primary through quaternary structural features of recombinant sickle hemoglobin are described. The molecular weight of the purified recombinant sickle hemoglobin was identical to natural sickle hemoglobin as determined by mass spectrometry, thus excluding extensive post-translational modification in the yeast system. Carboxypeptidases A and B together catalyzed the release of COOH-terminal amino acids at the same rate for recombinant and natural hemoglobin S, consistent with identity in their primary and secondary structures in this region of the molecule. The tryptic peptide maps of natural and recombinant hemoglobins were practically indistinguishable, indicating the same internal protein sequences for recombinant and natural hemoglobins. As a probe of the secondary structure of recombinant sickle Hb, the reactivity of the SH group of Cys-93(beta) was investigated for the glutathione sickle hemoglobin adduct, which has significant anti-gelling and anti-sickling properties. The position of glutathione at Cys-93(beta) was established by direct mass spectrometric analysis of enzyme digests; reduction of this derivative to the unmodified chains was also observed by mass spectrometry and by isoelectric focusing. The oxygen equilibrium curves of recombinant and natural sickle hemoglobin at high protein concentration were superimposable with identical Hill coefficients of 3.3. The response of recombinant sickle hemoglobin to chloride with respect to a lowered oxygen affinity was identical to that of natural sickle hemoglobin. The gelation properties of recombinant and natural sickle hemoglobins were identical at the high hemoglobin concentrations that occur in the red cell. Therefore, the yeast expression system synthesizes a completely functional recombinant sickle hemoglobin with the same biochemical and physiological properties as natural sickle hemoglobin with respect to features characteristic of its primary through quaternary structures."
https://openalex.org/W1548779076,"The object of this study was to examine the effects of extracellular amino acids on hepatic apoB100 metabolism using a transformed human liver cell line (HepG2) as a hepatocyte model. The data demonstrate that reduced extracellular amino acids resulted in marked increases in apoB100 concentrations in the medium (87 +/- 10% increase; p < 0.002). These data contrast with the effects of amino acids on secretion of total hepatic protein into the medium, which increased by 541 +/- 83% at 5.5 mg/ml amino acids compared to the low (0.5 mg/ml) amino acid medium (p < 0.01), pointing to a positive relationship between the concentration of amino acids in the medium and overall secretion of protein by the HepG2 cells. No significant effect of medium amino acid concentration on intracellular synthesis of cholesterol ester, cholesterol, triglyceride, or apoA1 secretion was evident. Amino acids also affected the activity of the low density lipoprotein pathway: at lower medium amino acid concentration, specific cell-associated radioactivity and cellular degradation were increased (117 +/- 24 and 233 +/- 13% at 0.5 versus 5.5 mg/ml amino acids, respectively). Pulse-chase analysis demonstrated that there was no difference in secretion efficiency of apoB (36 +/- 6 versus 46 +/- 8% in low versus high amino acid medium, respectively), but that the initial amount of [3H]apoB synthesized was greater in the low amino acid medium (10.5 +/- 3.8 versus 5.7 +/- 1.7 x 10(3) dpm [3H]apoB/mg of cell protein; p < 0.05). In contrast, the initial amount of [3H]albumin synthesized was much greater in the high amino acid medium (26.6 +/- 5.0 versus 54.6 +/- 19.0 x 10(3) dpm [3H]albumin/mg of cell protein in low versus high amino acid medium, respectively; p < 0.05). Slot blot analysis of apoB mRNA was 87 +/- 22% higher in lower amino acid medium as compared to the high amino acid medium (p < 0.01). These results demonstrate that amino acids have a profound negative regulatory effect on apoB synthesis and secretion and may shed light on the pathogenesis of some clinical dyslipidemias such as the increased plasma apoB levels in patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis."
https://openalex.org/W1607725326,"The reactions of a beef heart cytochrome c1 preparation containing the hinge protein with horse cytochrome c derivatives labeled at specific lysine amino groups with (dicarboxybipyridine)(bisbipyridine)ruthenium(II) (Ru(II)) were studied by flash photolysis. All of the ruthenium-cytochrome c derivatives formed complexes with cytochrome c1 in low ionic strength buffer (5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7). Excitation of Ru(II) to Ru(II*) with a 0.4-microseconds laser flash resulted in rapid electron transfer to the ferric heme group in cytochrome c, followed by electron transfer from the ferrous heme group of cytochrome c to the ferric heme group of cytochrome c1. The kinetic difference spectra displayed maxima at 546 nm and minima at 554 nm characteristic of electron transfer between the two cytochromes. The rate constants were independent of concentration at low ionic strength, indicating intracomplex electron transfer. The rate constants were 4,800, 6,800, 22,000, and 22,000 s-1 for cytochrome c derivatives modified at lysines 13, 27, 25, and 72, respectively. The observed rate constants were independent of ionic strength up to about 50 nM and then decreased progressively with further increases in ionic strength indicating dissociation of the complex. Second-order kinetics were observed at 310 mM ionic strength, with rate constants of 1.0 x 10(6), 1.6 x 10(7), 1.2 x 10(8), and 3.0 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 for the derivatives modified at lysines 13, 27, 25, and 72, respectively. The ionic strength dependence of the second-order rate constants is comparable to that involving native horse cytochrome c and is consistent with electron transfer reactions between oppositely charged proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1529503534,"We previously reported that a subpopulation of asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGP-Rs), designated State 2 ASGP-Rs, can be inactivated in digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes in the absence of cytosol by a process that is temperature- and ATP-dependent (Medh, J. D., and Weigel, P. H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 8771-8778). Here we show that these inactivated ASGP-Rs are reactivated by the sole addition of fatty acyl-CoA. Of the derivatives tested (acyl chain length 4-18), palmitoyl-CoA was the most effective, although stearoyl-CoA (C18) and myristoyl-CoA (C14) were also active. Lauroyl-CoA (C12) was about half as effective as palmitoyl-CoA, and decanoyl-CoA (C10) and butyl-CoA (C4) were inactive. ASGP-R reactivation did not take place in the presence of free palmitate and coenzyme A, but did occur if low levels of ATP were also added to drive palmitoyl-CoA synthesis by the permeable cells. Addition of ATP after ASGP-R reactivation with palmitoyl-CoA again resulted in a rapid inactivation of these receptors. The extent and rate of this second ASGP-R inactivation process were proportional to ATP concentration; half-maximal effects occurred at approximately 0.5 mM ATP. ATP also rapidly reversed the ASGP-R reactivation seen with the other fatty acyl-CoAs. The results demonstrate the existence of a previously unrecognized pathway that regulates the activity of the ASGP-R population responsible for the majority of ligand endocytosis and processing in hepatocytes. This novel receptor inactivation/reaction cycle could ensure the high efficiency of segregating ligand and receptor during endocytosis and receptor recycling."
https://openalex.org/W1595564496,"Fibronectin binds to platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa in Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-dependent and -independent manner. We have isolated and characterized the 29-kDa dispase fragment of fibronectin. Binding of 125I-fibronectin to thrombin-stimulated platelets was inhibited by the 29-kDa fragment and the GRGDSPA peptide with IC50 values of 1.5 +/- 0.4 and 8.1 +/- 0.9 microM, respectively. The NH2-terminal sequence of this fragment gave this result: Ala-Val-Thr-Thr-Ile-Pro-Ala-Pro-Thr-Asp. This established the position of this peptide within fibronectin as beginning with the residue tentatively designated 1597. Neither the RGDS sequence nor the RGD-independent binding domain of fibronectin (Bowditch, R. D., Halloran, C. E., Aota, S., Obara, M., Plow, E. F., Yamada, K. M., and Ginsberg, M. H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 23323-23328) was contained in this fragment. The 29-kDa fragment inhibited ADP-induced aggregation of platelets and binding of fibrinogen to activated platelets. The fragment bound to immobilized GPIIb-IIIa. The 125I-labeled 29-kDa fragment directly bound to thrombin-stimulated platelets with 98,000 +/- 4,600 molecules/platelet (Kd = 4.6 +/- 0.5 x 10(-6) M). Direct binding was inhibited by the unlabeled 29-kDa fragment but was not blocked by either the GRGDSPA peptide or the monoclonal anti-GPIIb-IIIa antibody. These results indicate that the additional RGD-independent binding domain(s) to GPIIb-IIIa are present on fibronectin. This additional binding domain(s) on fibronectin may prevent thrombus formation by interfering with the interaction of fibrinogen with GPIIb-IIIa."
https://openalex.org/W1599254089,"Identification of the substrate activation site of beta-trypsin by a 1:1 reaction with p-diazoniumbenzamidine chloride was confirmed by spectral analysis. Proteolysis of Cm-p-benzamidino-azo-beta-trypsin provided peptides containing modified tyrosine residues. The major product, Ser-146 to Lys-156, which corresponded to labeling at Tyr-151, was recovered in 35% yield, and its structure was demonstrated by amino acid analysis, Edman degradation, and mass spectrometry. Yields of labeled Tyr-151, Tyr-39, and Tyr-172, identified by peptide analysis, were in the proportion of 100:7:3. Tyr-151-(p-benzamidino)-azo-beta-trypsin is permanently activated, but can be further activated by substrates. Values of kcat, Ks', and kcat' vary from two to three times the equivalent values for trypsin. Berenil (4,4'-diazoamino-bis-benzamidine), a parabolic competitive inhibitor of beta-trypsin, was a hyperbolic competitive inhibitor of azo-beta-trypsin. Thus, Tyr-151, part of subsite S'2, affects the catalytic process and, when modified covalently, permanently activates trypsin. Equilibrium binding with berenil supported the kinetic data obtained with substrates. This permits the integration of protein modification, kinetics, equilibrium binding, and crystallographic data to demonstrate a fine interaction between subsites S1-S3 and S'2 in trypsin and azo-beta-trypsin, resulting in subtle structural changes when the native enzyme is covalently modified at Tyr-151."
https://openalex.org/W1549559739,"Both positive and negative regulatory elements responsive to the product of the adenovirus type 12 E1A gene are located in the promoter region of the gene for mouse H-2Kbm1 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen (1). We have analyzed the negative regulatory element that is affected by E1A and identified a target CAA repeated motif, CAA(A)CAAA, within -1725 to -1705 and -1591 to -1568 in a 316-bp sequence located in the far upstream region of H-2Kb promoter (-1837 to -1522; +1 refers to the cap site). The extent of cell surface expression of the MHC class 1 antigen was significantly decreased in the case of transfectants obtained by introducing an expression plasmid that included MHC class 1 cDNA with the CAA repeated element, as compared with that of a plasmid with mutated CAA repeats. We have also characterized the nuclear proteins that bind to this motif. The analysis of the effects of mutations during competition assays of in vivo and gel retardation competition assays demonstrated that the CAA repeated element is essential not only for E1A-dependent repression of transcription but also for the cell surface expression of the product of the mouse H-2Kb class I gene, presumably through nuclear proteins that specifically bind to it."
https://openalex.org/W1577759296,"Limited proteolysis of the triose-phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.1) by subtilisin generates peptides that remain noncovalently attached and catalytically active. Edman degradation of the peptides showed that the primary proteolytic sites for yeast triose-phosphate isomerase are the Leu174-Ala175 bond followed by Ser52-Leu53. The Leu174-Ala175 site is of particular interest, since it forms part of the hinged lid that closes over the catalytic center, and this bond is only 12.2 A (open) or 9.8 A (closed) from the catalytic residue Glu165. The higher Km, kcat, and kcat/Km values exhibited by the catalytically active peptide complex suggest that the substrate is not bound as tightly to the catalytic center. In addition, increased methylglyoxal formation by the cleaved enzyme indicates that the enzyme-substrate complex is less protected from the solvent. Circular dichroic and fluorescence spectra show that the overall structure of the peptide complex is similar to the native enzyme but with local structural perturbations around the tryptophans. Also, the peptide complex is more susceptible to denaturation by guanidine and exhibits lower Tm values, indicating a loose interaction between the fragments. Unfolding, dissociation, and refolding experiments suggest that the fragments have strong inherent secondary structural features and can reassociate into catalytically active structures."
https://openalex.org/W1549846923,"The intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is necessary for ligand-induced signaling. To determine whether cellular protein tyrosine kinases are substrates for EGF-activated receptors, phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were isolated from EGF-treated cells and assayed for tyrosine kinase activity using peptide substrates. A tyrosine kinase activity that is distinct from the EGF receptor was adsorbed to monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody columns and eluted with phenyl phosphate. Near-maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of this kinase occurred within 1 min of cell stimulation with an ED50 for EGF of 2.5 nM. The kinase was deactivated by incubation with purified CD45 tyrosine phosphatase in vitro, but activity could be restored by incubation with purified EGF receptor and Mn2+ ATP. These results suggest a cascade of tyrosine kinase signaling analogous to well characterized serine/threonine kinase cascades."
https://openalex.org/W1606978339,"The adult bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) has two major tetrameric hemoglobins, B and C, which share a common beta chain but have different alpha chains. Components B and C associate upon deoxygenation to form a complex of the form BC2, a trimer of tetramers that depends on contacts between the alpha B and alpha C chains. Nucleotide sequences of cDNA transcripts for these chains have been determined. Transcripts were identified by analysis of the amino acid compositions of the tryptic peptides of the components and by partial amino acid sequencing. These results, together with the amino acid sequence of the beta chain (Tam, L.-T., Gray, G. P., and Riggs, A. F. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 8290-8294), permit an analysis of the structures of the alpha 2 beta 2 tetramers of hemoglobins B and C. Molecular modeling suggests possible residues at the alpha B-alpha C interfaces in the BC2 trimer and additional alpha C-alpha C contacts that would form a closed ring of six alpha chain subunits that would further stabilize the BC2 trimer. Phylogenetic analysis of the alpha B sequence suggests that it may be a tadpole chain, the temporal expression of which has shifted from larva to adult."
https://openalex.org/W1527153344,"Hemolysates from the adult bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, show an unusually high degree of cooperativity of oxygen binding with Hill coefficients greater than 4. The principal components of the tetrameric hemoglobin, B and C, do not show this high cooperativity when isolated, but it reappears when the components are mixed. Sedimentation velocity measurements show that the unusual behavior results from the mixed association of components B and C to form complexes larger than tetramers. Computer simulation of the sedimentation behavior of mixtures of deoxygenated B and C components shows that the gradient profiles can be satisfactorily described in terms of an equilibrium between the B and C tetramers and a BC2 trimer. The simplest model consistent with the results is the mixed association: B + C BC and BC + C BC2, with the second binding constant being higher than the first, indicating significant cooperativity. The extent of association is highest at low pH and low temperature. The dissociation of the B.C complex with low oxygen affinity to higher affinity B and C molecules during oxygenation results in greatly increased cooperativity of oxygen binding with higher Hill coefficients than possessed by either component alone in equilibria measured between 5 and 25 degrees C and between pH 6 and 8."
https://openalex.org/W1515569689,"Abstract Short hydrophobic N-carbobenzoxy oligopeptides are known to inhibit the infectivity of several enveloped viruses. Recently, it was shown that they inhibited the fusion of Sendai virus with N-methyl-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (N-methyl-DOPE) liposomes as well as the low pH-induced fusion of these liposomes with each other (Kelsey, D.R., Flanagan, T. D., Young, J. E., and Yeagle, P. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 12178-12183). Therefore it was concluded that the peptides inhibit membrane fusion, an important step in viral infectivity. Here, it is shown that this peptide and a series of similar peptides did not inhibit influenza virus fusion with N-methyl-DOPE or other liposomes. In fact, some peptides enhanced the overall rate of fusion of influenza virus with N-methyl-DOPE liposomes. In our hands, the peptides did not inhibit influenza infectivity in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells or influenza-induced hemolysis either. They also did not inhibit the Ca(2+)-induced fusion between cardiolipin or phosphatidylserine liposomes. However, the inhibitory effect of one of the peptides on the fusion of Sendai virus with N-methyl-DOPE liposomes and on N-methyl-DOPE liposome-liposome fusion could be reproduced. These data indicate that the peptides do not, as had been suggested (Yeagle, P.L., Young, J.E., Hui, S.W., and Epand, R. M. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 3177-3183), act by preventing the formation of lipid structures with small radii of curvature, such as the inverted phase intermediates that are thought to be involved in N-methyl-DOPE fusion. The results also suggest that the mechanism of inhibition of Sendai virus infection and N-methyl-DOPE fusion by the peptides may be different after all."
