https://openalex.org/W2116516144,"Acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) is the central biosynthetic precursor for fatty-acid synthesis and protein acetylation. In the conventional view of mammalian cell metabolism, AcCoA is primarily generated from glucose-derived pyruvate through the citrate shuttle and ATP citrate lyase in the cytosol. However, proliferating cells that exhibit aerobic glycolysis and those exposed to hypoxia convert glucose to lactate at near-stoichiometric levels, directing glucose carbon away from the tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty-acid synthesis. Although glutamine is consumed at levels exceeding that required for nitrogen biosynthesis, the regulation and use of glutamine metabolism in hypoxic cells is not well understood. Here we show that human cells use reductive metabolism of α-ketoglutarate to synthesize AcCoA for lipid synthesis. This isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1)-dependent pathway is active in most cell lines under normal culture conditions, but cells grown under hypoxia rely almost exclusively on the reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived α-ketoglutarate for de novo lipogenesis. Furthermore, renal cell lines deficient in the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein preferentially use reductive glutamine metabolism for lipid biosynthesis even at normal oxygen levels. These results identify a critical role for oxygen in regulating carbon use to produce AcCoA and support lipid synthesis in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2092152920,"Mitochondrial metabolism provides precursors to build macromolecules in growing cancer cells. In normally functioning tumour cell mitochondria, oxidative metabolism of glucose- and glutamine-derived carbon produces citrate and acetyl-coenzyme A for lipid synthesis, which is required for tumorigenesis. Yet some tumours harbour mutations in the citric acid cycle (CAC) or electron transport chain (ETC) that disable normal oxidative mitochondrial function, and it is unknown how cells from such tumours generate precursors for macromolecular synthesis. Here we show that tumour cells with defective mitochondria use glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation rather than oxidative metabolism as the major pathway of citrate formation. This pathway uses mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms of NADP(+)/NADPH-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, and subsequent metabolism of glutamine-derived citrate provides both the acetyl-coenzyme A for lipid synthesis and the four-carbon intermediates needed to produce the remaining CAC metabolites and related macromolecular precursors. This reductive, glutamine-dependent pathway is the dominant mode of metabolism in rapidly growing malignant cells containing mutations in complex I or complex III of the ETC, in patient-derived renal carcinoma cells with mutations in fumarate hydratase, and in cells with normal mitochondria subjected to acute pharmacological ETC inhibition. Our findings reveal the novel induction of a versatile glutamine-dependent pathway that reverses many of the reactions of the canonical CAC, supports tumour cell growth, and explains how cells generate pools of CAC intermediates in the face of impaired mitochondrial metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2060813891,"All homeotherms use thermogenesis to maintain their core body temperature, ensuring that cellular functions and physiological processes can continue in cold environments. In the prevailing model of thermogenesis, when the hypothalamus senses cold temperatures it triggers sympathetic discharge, resulting in the release of noradrenaline in brown adipose tissue and white adipose tissue. Acting via the β(3)-adrenergic receptors, noradrenaline induces lipolysis in white adipocytes, whereas it stimulates the expression of thermogenic genes, such as PPAR-γ coactivator 1a (Ppargc1a), uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (Acsl1), in brown adipocytes. However, the precise nature of all the cell types involved in this efferent loop is not well established. Here we report in mice an unexpected requirement for the interleukin-4 (IL-4)-stimulated program of alternative macrophage activation in adaptive thermogenesis. Exposure to cold temperature rapidly promoted alternative activation of adipose tissue macrophages, which secrete catecholamines to induce thermogenic gene expression in brown adipose tissue and lipolysis in white adipose tissue. Absence of alternatively activated macrophages impaired metabolic adaptations to cold, whereas administration of IL-4 increased thermogenic gene expression, fatty acid mobilization and energy expenditure, all in a macrophage-dependent manner. Thus, we have discovered a role for alternatively activated macrophages in the orchestration of an important mammalian stress response, the response to cold."
https://openalex.org/W2053984526,"Stem cell-based regenerative medicine is a promising approach in tissue reconstruction. Here we show that proinflammatory T cells inhibit the ability of exogenously added bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) to mediate bone repair. This inhibition is due to interferon γ (IFN-γ)-induced downregulation of the runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx-2) pathway and enhancement of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) signaling in the stem cells. We also found that, through inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), TNF-α converts the signaling of the IFN-γ-activated, nonapoptotic form of TNF receptor superfamily member 6 (Fas) in BMMSCs to a caspase 3- and caspase 8-associated proapoptotic cascade, resulting in the apoptosis of these cells. Conversely, reduction of IFN-γ and TNF-α concentrations by systemic infusion of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, or by local administration of aspirin, markedly improved BMMSC-based bone regeneration and calvarial defect repair in C57BL/6 mice. These data collectively show a previously unrecognized role of recipient T cells in BMMSC-based tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W1986696487,"Antiviral T cells are thought to regulate whether hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections result in viral control, asymptomatic persistence or severe disease, although the reasons for these different outcomes remain unclear. Recent genetic evidence, however, has indicated a correlation between certain natural killer (NK)-cell receptors and progression of both HIV and HCV infection, implying that NK cells have a role in these T-cell-associated diseases. Although direct NK-cell-mediated lysis of virus-infected cells may contribute to antiviral defence during some virus infections--especially murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infections in mice and perhaps HIV in humans--NK cells have also been suspected of having immunoregulatory functions. For instance, NK cells may indirectly regulate T-cell responses by lysing MCMV-infected antigen-presenting cells. In contrast to MCMV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice seems to be resistant to any direct antiviral effects of NK cells. Here we examine the roles of NK cells in regulating T-cell-dependent viral persistence and immunopathology in mice infected with LCMV, an established model for HIV and HCV infections in humans. We describe a three-way interaction, whereby activated NK cells cytolytically eliminate activated CD4 T cells that affect CD8 T-cell function and exhaustion. At high virus doses, NK cells prevented fatal pathology while enabling T-cell exhaustion and viral persistence, but at medium doses NK cells paradoxically facilitated lethal T-cell-mediated pathology. Thus, NK cells can act as rheostats, regulating CD4 T-cell-mediated support for the antiviral CD8 T cells that control viral pathogenesis and persistence."

https://openalex.org/W2139051378,"Several lines of evidence indicate that prefibrillar assemblies of amyloid-β (Aβ) polypeptides, such as soluble oligomers or protofibrils, rather than mature, end-stage amyloid fibrils cause neuronal dysfunction and memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that reducing the prevalence of transient intermediates by small molecule-mediated stimulation of amyloid polymerization might decrease toxicity. Here we demonstrate the acceleration of Aβ fibrillogenesis through the action of the orcein-related small molecule O4, which directly binds to hydrophobic amino acid residues in Aβ peptides and stabilizes the self-assembly of seeding-competent, β-sheet-rich protofibrils and fibrils. Notably, the O4-mediated acceleration of amyloid fibril formation efficiently decreases the concentration of small, toxic Aβ oligomers in complex, heterogeneous aggregation reactions. In addition, O4 treatment suppresses inhibition of long-term potentiation by Aβ oligomers in hippocampal brain slices. These results support the hypothesis that small, diffusible prefibrillar amyloid species rather than mature fibrillar aggregates are toxic for mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2020423861,"Reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) resets the epigenome to an embryonic-like state. Vitamin C enhances the reprogramming process, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we show that the histone demethylases Jhdm1a/1b are key effectors of somatic cell reprogramming downstream of vitamin C. We first observed that vitamin C induces H3K36me2/3 demethylation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts in culture and during reprogramming. We then identified Jhdm1a/1b, two known vitamin-C-dependent H3K36 demethylases, as potent regulators of reprogramming through gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Furthermore, we found that Jhdm1b accelerates cell cycle progression and suppresses cell senescence during reprogramming by repressing the Ink4/Arf locus. Jhdm1b also cooperates with Oct4 to activate the microRNA cluster 302/367, an integral component of the pluripotency machinery. Our results therefore reveal a role for H3K36me2/3 in cell fate determination and establish a link between histone demethylases and vitamin-C-induced reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W1995984781,"The Src family kinase Lyn is identified as a physiological redox sensor that mediates the initial attraction of leukocytes to wounds in zebrafish larvae. It is known that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) — often an ingredient in over-the-counter medicines for cleaning cuts — is generated at injured tissue and that it attracts immune cells (neutrophils) that promote wound healing. How immune cells sense the H2O2 secreted from wounds was not known. This study identifies an Src family kinase, Lyn, as a redox sensor that mediates initial neutrophil recruitment. Exposure to H2O2 directly oxidizes a single cysteine residue is indispensable in Lyn, and inhibition of Lyn attenuates neutrophil wound recruitment. Tissue wounding induces the rapid recruitment of leukocytes1. Wounds and tumours—a type of ‘unhealed wound’2—generate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through an NADPH oxidase (NOX). This extracellular H2O2 mediates recruitment of leukocytes, particularly the first responders of innate immunity, neutrophils, to injured tissue3,4,5,6. However, the sensor that neutrophils use to detect the redox state at wounds is unknown. Here we identify the Src family kinase (SFK) Lyn as a redox sensor that mediates initial neutrophil recruitment to wounds in zebrafish larvae. Lyn activation in neutrophils is dependent on wound-derived H2O2 after tissue injury, and inhibition of Lyn attenuates neutrophil wound recruitment. Inhibition of SFKs also disrupted H2O2-mediated chemotaxis of primary human neutrophils. In vitro analysis identified a single cysteine residue, C466, as being responsible for direct oxidation-mediated activation of Lyn. Furthermore, transgenic-tissue-specific reconstitution with wild-type Lyn and a cysteine mutant revealed that Lyn C466 is important for the neutrophil wound response and downstream signalling in vivo. This is the first identification, to our knowledge, of a physiological redox sensor that mediates leukocyte wound attraction in multicellular organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2157384708,"The T cell receptor (TCR) orchestrates immune responses by binding to foreign peptides presented at the cell surface in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Effective immunity requires that all possible foreign peptide-MHC molecules are recognized or risks leaving holes in immune coverage that pathogens could quickly evolve to exploit. It is unclear how a limited pool of <10(8) human TCRs can successfully provide immunity to the vast array of possible different peptides that could be produced from 20 proteogenic amino acids and presented by self-MHC molecules (>10(15) distinct peptide-MHCs). One possibility is that T cell immunity incorporates an extremely high level of receptor degeneracy, enabling each TCR to recognize multiple peptides. However, the extent of such TCR degeneracy has never been fully quantified. Here, we perform a comprehensive experimental and mathematical analysis to reveal that a single patient-derived autoimmune CD8(+) T cell clone of pathogenic relevance in human type I diabetes recognizes >one million distinct decamer peptides in the context of a single MHC class I molecule. A large number of peptides that acted as substantially better agonists than the wild-type ""index"" preproinsulin-derived peptide (ALWGPDPAAA) were identified. The RQFGPDFPTI peptide (sampled from >10(8) peptides) was >100-fold more potent than the index peptide despite differing from this sequence at 7 of 10 positions. Quantification of this previously unappreciated high level of CD8(+) T cell cross-reactivity represents an important step toward understanding the system requirements for adaptive immunity and highlights the enormous potential of TCR degeneracy to be the causative factor in autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2072262638,"Using a multisensory cue-conflict task, the authors report that monkeys employ the optimal strategy of weighting each cue in proportion to its reliability, and that population decoding of neural responses from area MSTd predicts behavioral cue weighting. This behavior is further linked to the specific computations by which single neurons combine their inputs, consistent with recent theories of optimal probabilistic neural computation. Integration of multiple sensory cues is essential for precise and accurate perception and behavioral performance, yet the reliability of sensory signals can vary across modalities and viewing conditions. Human observers typically employ the optimal strategy of weighting each cue in proportion to its reliability, but the neural basis of this computation remains poorly understood. We trained monkeys to perform a heading discrimination task from visual and vestibular cues, varying cue reliability randomly. The monkeys appropriately placed greater weight on the more reliable cue, and population decoding of neural responses in the dorsal medial superior temporal area closely predicted behavioral cue weighting, including modest deviations from optimality. We found that the mathematical combination of visual and vestibular inputs by single neurons is generally consistent with recent theories of optimal probabilistic computation in neural circuits. These results provide direct evidence for a neural mechanism mediating a simple and widespread form of statistical inference."
https://openalex.org/W2088578081,"This report identifies oncogenic fusions in individuals with breast cancer involving the genes encoding NOTCH and MAST, recurring in approximately 5–7% of studied cases. The fusions show growth-promoting properties that suggest that they may represent targetable events in a subset of people with breast cancer. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that has a wide range of molecular aberrations and clinical outcomes. Here we used paired-end transcriptome sequencing to explore the landscape of gene fusions in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and tissues. We observed that individual breast cancers have a variety of expressed gene fusions. We identified two classes of recurrent gene rearrangements involving genes encoding microtubule-associated serine-threonine kinase (MAST) and members of the Notch family. Both MAST and Notch-family gene fusions have substantial phenotypic effects in breast epithelial cells. Breast cancer cell lines harboring Notch gene rearrangements are uniquely sensitive to inhibition of Notch signaling, and overexpression of MAST1 or MAST2 gene fusions has a proliferative effect both in vitro and in vivo. These findings show that recurrent gene rearrangements have key roles in subsets of carcinomas and suggest that transcriptome sequencing could identify individuals with rare, targetable gene fusions."
https://openalex.org/W1983541741,"Using a systems biology approach, we discovered and dissected a three-way interaction between the immune system, the intestinal epithelium and the microbiota. We found that, in the absence of B cells, or of IgA, and in the presence of the microbiota, the intestinal epithelium launches its own protective mechanisms, upregulating interferon-inducible immune response pathways and simultaneously repressing Gata4-related metabolic functions. This shift in intestinal function leads to lipid malabsorption and decreased deposition of body fat. Network analysis revealed the presence of two interconnected epithelial-cell gene networks, one governing lipid metabolism and another regulating immunity, that were inversely expressed. Gene expression patterns in gut biopsies from individuals with common variable immunodeficiency or with HIV infection and intestinal malabsorption were very similar to those of the B cell-deficient mice, providing a possible explanation for a longstanding enigmatic association between immunodeficiency and defective lipid absorption in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2112765785,"Glycoconjugate vaccines have provided enormous health benefits globally, but they have been less successful in some populations at high risk for developing disease. To identify new approaches to enhancing glycoconjugate effectiveness, we investigated molecular and cellular mechanisms governing the immune response to a prototypical glycoconjugate vaccine. We found that in antigen-presenting cells a carbohydrate epitope is generated upon endolysosomal processing of group B streptococcal type III polysaccharide coupled to a carrier protein. In conjunction with a carrier protein-derived peptide, this carbohydrate epitope binds major histocompatibility class II (MHCII) and stimulates carbohydrate-specific CD4(+) T cell clones to produce interleukins 2 and 4-cytokines essential for providing T cell help to antibody-producing B cells. An archetypical glycoconjugate vaccine that we constructed to maximize the presentation of carbohydrate-specific T cell epitopes is 50-100 times more potent and substantially more protective in a neonatal mouse model of group B Streptococcus infection than a vaccine constructed by methods currently used by the vaccine industry. Our discovery of how glycoconjugates are processed resulting in presentation of carbohydrate epitopes that stimulate CD4(+) T cells has key implications for glycoconjugate vaccine design that could result in greatly enhanced vaccine efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2140951889,"The accumulation of data on structural variation in cancer genomes provides an opportunity to better understand the mechanisms of genomic alterations and the forces of selection that act upon these alterations in cancer. Here we test evidence supporting the influence of two major forces, spatial chromosome structure and purifying (or negative) selection, on the landscape of somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) in cancer. Using a maximum likelihood approach, we compare SCNA maps and three-dimensional genome architecture as determined by genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (HiC) and described by the proposed fractal-globule model. This analysis suggests that the distribution of chromosomal alterations in cancer is spatially related to three-dimensional genomic architecture and that purifying selection, as well as positive selection, influences SCNAs during somatic evolution of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2003159754,"Tideglusib is a GSK-3 inhibitor currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Sustained oral administration of the compound to a variety of animal models decreases Tau hyperphosphorylation, lowers brain amyloid plaque load, improves learning and memory, and prevents neuronal loss. We report here that tideglusib inhibits GSK-3β irreversibly, as demonstrated by the lack of recovery in enzyme function after the unbound drug has been removed from the reaction medium and the fact that its dissociation rate constant is non-significantly different from zero. Such irreversibility may explain the non-competitive inhibition pattern with respect to ATP shown by tideglusib and perhaps other structurally related compounds. The replacement of Cys-199 by an Ala residue in the enzyme seems to increase the dissociation rate, although the drug retains its inhibitory activity with decreased potency and long residence time. In addition, tideglusib failed to inhibit a series of kinases that contain a Cys homologous to Cys-199 in their active site, suggesting that its inhibition of GSK-3β obeys to a specific mechanism and is not a consequence of nonspecific reactivity. Results obtained with [35S]tideglusib do not support unequivocally the existence of a covalent bond between the drug and GSK-3β. The irreversibility of the inhibition and the very low protein turnover rate observed for the enzyme are particularly relevant from a pharmacological perspective and could have significant implications on its therapeutic potential.

Alzheimer disease (AD) 3The abbreviations used are: ADAlzheimer diseaseAβamyloid β peptideDTEdithioerythritolGSK-3βglycogen synthase kinase-3βTDZDthiadiazolidindioneGdnHClguanidine hydrochloride. is the most prevalent form of dementia. Around 26 million people worldwide suffer from this withering disorder according to the World Health Organization, and it is believed that this figure will grow to reach nearly 80 million cases by 2050 (1Alzheimer's Association 2011 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures.Alzheimers Dement. 2011; 7: 208-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). There currently is no effective treatment that delays the onset or slows the progression of AD. Despite extensive research efforts over the past decades to identify the precise cause of the disease and to understand the mechanisms leading to this pathological state, they still remain elusive, although significant progress has been achieved and many aspects of the biology of AD have been unveiled. Alzheimer disease amyloid β peptide dithioerythritol glycogen synthase kinase-3β thiadiazolidindione guanidine hydrochloride. The “amyloid hypothesis” has become the leading hypothesis to explain AD pathophysiology. It suggests that the accumulation of the amyloid β peptide is the primary factor that triggers a cascade of pathogenic events leading to alterations in Tau protein, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal death (2Hardy J. A hundred years of Alzheimer's disease research.Neuron. 2006; 52: 3-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Despite recent clinical failures of several drug candidates targeted towards the key steps of the amyloid cascade, the critical role of amyloid in the pathogenesis of AD is still widely accepted, and many efforts are currently being directed to establish how the oligomers formed in the initial steps of amyloid aggregation affect the neurodegenerative process characteristic of this condition and influence the pernicious events that characterize the pathology (3Haass C.

As a consequence, drug discovery efforts against AD over the past two decades have primarily focused on targets defined by the amyloid cascade hypothesis, so far with disappointing results. These failures underscore the need for novel therapeutic approaches to successfully halt or reverse the pathology and cognitive decline in AD. By contrast, strategies focused on the alterations suffered by Tau protein have received relatively little attention until recently despite the fact that the presence of extensive Tau pathology is central to the disease. In this context, glycogen synthase kinase-3β has recently been proposed as a link between the two major pathological pathways in AD, amyloid and Tau (6Muyllaert D. Kremer A. Jaworski T. Borghgraef P.

Amyloid-β and Tau–a toxic pas de deux in Alzheimer's disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 12: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar), leading to the “GSK-3 hypothesis of AD” (9Hooper C. Killick R. Lovestone S. The GSK3 hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease.J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 1433-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Thus, GSK-3β inhibition has emerged as one of the most promising therapeutic strategies in AD. Originally discovered because of its role in the regulation of glucose metabolism, GSK-3β appears to be a cellular hub, integrating several signaling systems. The regulation of its activity occurs by complex mechanisms that are each dependent upon specific signaling pathways (reviewed in Ref. 10Medina M. Wandosell F. Deconstructing GSK-3: The fine regulation of its activity.Int. J. Alz. Dis. 2011; 2011: 479249Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). GSK-3β has been identified as the main kinase responsible for the hyperphosphorylation of Tau, leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in AD brains (11Hanger D.P. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R.

Consequently, the enzyme has been recognized as a relevant player not only in the pathogenesis of AD but in other tauopathies as well (10Medina M. Wandosell F. Deconstructing GSK-3: The fine regulation of its activity.Int. J. Alz. Dis. 2011; 2011: 479249Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Besides having been identified as the major Tau protein kinase, GSK-3β also mediates Aβ neurotoxicity, plays an essential role in synaptic plasticity and memory, might be involved in Aβ formation, and has an important role in inflammation and neuronal death, all key features of AD neuropathology (reviewed in Ref. 17Medina M. Avila J. The role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) in Alzheimer's disease.Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis: Core Concepts, Shifting Paradigms, and Therapeutic Targets. Intech Open Access Publisher, Rijeka, Croatia2011: 197-222Crossref Google Scholar). Indeed, GSK-3β is believed to induce neuronal mortality by prompting the degradation of β-catenin, hence avoiding the transcription of genes involved in cell survival, and also by promoting apoptosis (18Turenne G.A.

Chem. 2009; 284: 32619-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GSK-3β impairs axonal transport through a mechanism triggered by Aβ oligomers and mediated by NMDA receptors (20Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. CREB DNA binding activity is inhibited by glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta and facilitated by lithium.J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). GSK-3β has also been confirmed as a key player in the process of memory impairment, one of the characteristic symptoms of AD; it negatively affects neuronal plasticity by promoting the inactivation of cAMP-response element-binding protein, a transcription factor involved in synaptic plasticity. GSK-3β also contributes to the dysfunction of APC (adenomatous polyposis coli gene product) and CRMP2 (collapsin response mediator protein-2), two structural proteins implicated in synaptic remodeling (21Yoshimura T. Kawano Y. Arimura N. Kawabata S. Kikuchi A. Kaibuchi K.

In addition, recent results demonstrate that GSK-3β is directly involved in the long term potentiation inhibition caused by Aβ oligomers (23Jo J. Whitcomb D.J. Olsen K.M. Kerrigan T.L. Lo S.C.

Therefore, the discovery of small molecule inhibitors of GSK-3 has attracted significant attention both as a therapeutic agent and as a means to understand the molecular basis of AD and other tauopathies. A significant effort has been made in the past few years to synthesize highly selective, potent GSK-3 inhibitors. Some of them have shown in vivo efficacy in various animal models of AD (28Gentles R.G. Hua S. Dubowchik G.M.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitors reach the clinic.Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2008; 11: 533-543PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, the thiadiazolidindiones (TDZDs) were the first non-ATP competitive inhibitors of GSK-3 that were reported (31Martinez A. Alonso M. Castro A. Pérez C. Moreno F.J. First non-ATP competitive glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK-3β) inhibitors: thiadiazolidinones (TDZD) as potential drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 1292-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Members of this family have been tested in a number of animal models of AD. Remarkably, sustained oral administration of tideglusib (NP-12, NP031112; chemical structure shown in supplemental Fig. 1) to amyloid precursor protein/Tau transgenic mice led to an improvement in cognitive and behavioral deficits; a significant decrease in the levels of Tau phosphorylation, amyloid deposition and plaque-associated astrocytic proliferation and reduced neuronal loss (32Serenó L. Coma M. Rodríguez M. Sánchez-Ferrer P. Sánchez M.B. Gich I. Agulló J.M. Pérez M. Avila J. Guardia-Laguarta C. Clarimón J. Lleó A. Gómez-Isla T. A novel GSK-3beta inhibitor reduces Alzheimer's pathology and rescues neuronal loss in vivo.Neurobiol Dis. 2009; 35: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, tideglusib is the only GSK-3 inhibitor currently in clinical development for the treatment of AD; it is presently being tested in phase II clinical trials for both AD and progressive supranuclear palsy (33del Ser T. Phase IIA clinical trial on Alzheimer's Disease with NP-12, a GSK-3 inhibitor.Alzheimers and Dement. 2010; 6: S147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the successful results obtained for tideglusib in vivo, no data have been reported so far on the in vitro activity of the drug. Indeed, the only published data for compounds of the TDZD series show modest potencies on GSK-3β inhibition, with IC50 values in the micromolar range (31Martinez A. Alonso M. Castro A. Pérez C. Moreno F.J. First non-ATP competitive glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK-3β) inhibitors: thiadiazolidinones (TDZD) as potential drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.J. Med.

Therefore, we have undertaken enzymological studies on the inhibition of GSK-3β by tideglusib, and this paper describes the results obtained, which show an irreversible inhibition of the enzyme. The potential pharmacodynamic implications of this mechanism are discussed accordingly. Tideglusib was prepared in house at the Medicinal Chemistry Department. [35S]Tideglusib (2.28 GBq/mmol on the day the experiment was run) was prepared by Huntingdon Life Sciences (Huntingdon, UK). N-terminal His6-tagged human recombinant GSK-3β expressed by baculovirus in infected Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 cells was purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Sephadex G-25 (PD-10 columns) was from GE Healthcare. Z'-LYTETM reagents, expression vectors, and mouse monoclonal anti-GSK-3α/β antibody were from Invitrogen. β-Tubulin antibody was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). HRP-conjugated polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins were from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark) Alsterpaullone and hypothemycin were from Calbiochem. CT99021 was from Selleck (Houston, TX). All other reagents were of the highest purity available from Sigma unless otherwise stated. The mutant version of GSK-3β C199A was generated by using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) using a human GSK-3β cDNA from a commercial cDNA library in pcDNA4/HisMaxB and a suitable primer (5′-TATTAAAACTCGCTGACTTTGGAAGTG-3′) prepared in house. Constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 competent cells, and plasmid DNA was extracted with the Wizard® Miniprep kit (Promega, Madison, WI), the mutation being confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Large scale expression and purification was done at Protein Alternatives S.L. (Tres Cantos, Spain). The plasmid DNA with the mutation was subsequently engineered into pFastBac-Dual with a His6 tag, and MAX Efficiency® DH10BacTM competent cells (Invitrogen) were used to produce recombinant baculovirus molecules. Recombinant bacmid was then transfected into baculovirus-infected S. frugiperda Sf9 insect cells using Cellfectin® II reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions, resulting in the production of infectious recombinant baculovirus particles. The protein was expressed at 27 °C in a Wave Bioreactor system (GE Healthcare) using the transfected insect cells with a multiplicity of infection of 1. After 72 h, the cells were harvested, and extracts were prepared by sonication with 0.5% Triton X-100 in His-binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). After removing cellular debris by centrifugation, the protein was purified from the cleared supernatant by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography on a HiTrapTM column using an ÄKTATM system (GE Healthcare) with a 40–500 mm imidazole gradient in the same buffer over 10 column volumes. Purity and identity of the obtained protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and peptide mass fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF/TOF. Final material was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 25% glycerol and finally aliquoted, frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath, and stored at −80 °C. The activity of GSK-3β (both wild-type and C199A versions) was measured with the FRET-based Z′-LYTETM technology from Invitrogen using as peptide substrate the so-called “Ser/Thr-9,” a fluorescein- and coumarin-double-labeled 11-mer based on the sequence of human glycogen synthase I containing Ser-641. The assay was carried out at 25 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions in a final volume of 10 μl in 384-well low volume round bottom black plates (Corning Glass) with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.01% Brij-35 as assay buffer. Enzyme concentration ranged from 2 to 5 nm as determined by active-site titration with the well known inhibitor CT99021 (35Ring D.B. Johnson K.W. Henriksen E.J. Nuss J.M. Goff D. Kinnick T.R. Ma S.T.

Unless otherwise stated, ATP and peptide concentrations were 12.5 and 2 μm, respectively, corresponding to their respective previously determined Km values. Typically, the assays were run for 1 h in the presence or absence of compounds in a final DMSO concentration of 1%, and samples were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. When time courses were evaluated, the reactions were stopped at the intended times and processed as above. The final readout (emission ratio between coumarin and fluorescein) was obtained in an EnVision® Xcite plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the resulting values were converted to the amount of product formed using a standard curve with phosphorylated and intact peptides. When concentration responses of the compounds were evaluated, their potencies were determined as the negative logarithm of the IC50 in molar units (i.e. the pIC50) as the experiments were carried out by performing serial dilutions, and therefore the range of concentrations was evenly distributed in a logarithmic rather than a linear scale. pIC50 values were calculated by fitting the resulting data to Equation 1, using the nonlinear regression function of Prism® 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA).Percentage inhibition=Min+Min−Max1+10log⁡[I]+plC50n(Eq. 1) Equation 1 is a modified version of the classic isotherm equation, where Min and Max are the lower and higher asymptotes of the resulting sigmoid curve, [I] is the concentration of inhibitor in molar units, and n is the Hill coefficient. Percentage inhibition was calculated from the ratio of the enzyme activity in the presence and absence of compound. The mean pIC50 values from duplicate experiments were finally calculated, and these mean values were converted to IC50 values by taking the antilog. Likewise, the range of IC50 values defined by both duplicates was calculated by taking the antilog of the pIC50 range; the resulting value corresponds to the factor that must multiply or divide each IC50 to define such a range. When double titrations of ATP and tideglusib were performed, the assay was carried out as described above for 15 min (after having proved that linearity was kept during that time and a reasonably good approximation to initial rates was obtained), varying both ATP and tideglusib concentrations while keeping the concentration of peptide substrate fixed. Data analysis was performed by fitting the experimental data to the appropriate equations for competitive, uncompetitive, and non-competitive inhibition. The best results (as judged by F-test) were obtained when fitting to the non-competitive model described by Equation 2,v0=V⋅[S]Km⋅1+[l]Ki+[S]⋅1+[l]α⋅Ki(Eq. 2) where v0 is the initial rate, α is the parameter showing how the binding of the substrate and the inhibitor are mutually affected, Ki is the inhibition constant, Km is the Michaelis constant for ATP, V is the maximum velocity, and [I] and [S] are tideglusib and ATP concentrations, respectively. The reversibility of GSK-3β inhibition was tested by filtration through Amicon Ultra-0.5 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore) with a cut-off of 30 kDa followed by dilution of the concentrated retentate. Samples of 20 nm GSK-3β in the assay buffer described above were incubated with 1% DMSO or with a 1 μm concentration of the tested compounds in 1% DMSO for 30 min and then filtered by centrifugation according to the manufacturer's instructions. The retentate sample was diluted 20-fold with assay buffer to recover the original volume. This procedure was repeated twice (i.e. total dilution was 400-fold), and finally, the diluted retentate was used to measure the GSK-3β activity as described above. To further investigate the interaction of tideglusib with GSK-3β, binding studies with radioactive compound were performed. [35S]tideglusib (207 Bq/nmol) at 55 μm was incubated with 5 μm GSK-3β for 1 h at 25 °C in 315 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm EGTA. The incubation was extended for another 30 min after having added 35 μl of the same buffer with or without 100 mm DTE. Samples were then processed in three different ways. First, an aliquot of 125 μl of each sample was mixed with 375 μl of 8 m GdnHCl in H2O and heated at 80 °C for 5 min. A second aliquot of 125 μl was diluted up to 500 μl with H2O and left at room temperature for 5 min. In both cases, the free drug was removed afterwards by gel filtration through Sephadex G-25, and the amount of bound drug was determined by liquid scintillation counting on a 1450-MicroBeta TriLux counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Finally, a third 40-μl aliquot of each original sample was mixed with 10 μl of denaturing electrophoresis sample buffer without reducing agents, and 35 μl of this mixture was loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to SDS-PAGE (again in the absence of reducing agents except for the DTE already included in the corresponding sample), followed by fluorography of the dried gel. To determine the turnover rate of GSK-3β, cortical neurons were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, and the total GSK-3β concentration was measured at the indicated times by immunoblotting. Cortical neurons from CD-1 mouse embryos of 18-day gestation were obtained and maintained following procedures already described (37Gimenez-Cassina A. Lim F. Cerrato T. Palomo G.M. Diaz-Nido J. Mitochondrial hexokinase II promotes neuronal survival and acts downstream of glycogen synthase kinase-3.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3001-3011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After 4 days in vitro, the cells were treated with 50 μm cycloheximide, and at the intended time, they were lysed with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm PMSF, and the CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, resuspended in denaturing electrophoresis sample buffer, submitted to electrophoresis in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). Membranes were then blocked with 10% nonfat milk and incubated overnight with the mouse monoclonal anti-GSK-3α/β antibody (1:1000 dilution) and β-tubulin antibody (1:500) as the loading control. Finally, they were treated with the corresponding HRP-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin, and the immunoreactive proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare). The relative levels of GSK-3β were quantified by densitometry of the scanned images of the immunoblot. The half-life of the enzyme was calculated by fitting the time course of GSK-3β disappearance to a single exponential decay equation. Cell viability was monitored in parallel (LDH cell cytotoxicity kit from Roche Applied Science) to ensure that cell survival was above 90%. The inhibitory activities of tideglusib and hypothemycin on a panel of selected kinases were evaluated in the Invitrogen"

Critical to its function is the production of a specialized, mechanocompetent extracellular matrix controlled by master regulator transcription factor SOX9. Mutations in SOX9 cause campomelic dysplasia, a haploinsufficiency disorder resulting in severe skeletal defects and dwarfism. Although much is understood about how SOX9 regulates cartilage matrix synthesis and hence joint function, how this master regulator is itself regulated remains largely unknown. Here we identify a specific microRNA, miR-145, as a direct regulator of SOX9 in normal healthy human articular chondrocytes. We show that miR-145 directly represses SOX9 expression in human cells through a unique binding site in its 3′-UTR not conserved in mice. Modulation of miR-145 induced profound changes in the human chondrocyte phenotype. Specifically, increased miR-145 levels cause greatly reduced expression of critical cartilage extracellular matrix genes (COL2A1 and aggrecan) and tissue-specific microRNAs (miR-675 and miR-140) and increased levels of the hypertrophic markers RUNX2 and MMP13, characteristic of changes occurring in osteoarthritis.

https://openalex.org/W2074990437,"The authors show that rats trained with overlapping complex odorant mixtures have improved behavioral discrimination ability and enhanced cortical ensemble pattern separation. Training to disregard normally detectable differences between overlapping mixtures impairs cortical pattern separation and behavioral discrimination. These results show that the balance between pattern separation and completion is experience dependent. Learning to adapt to a complex and fluctuating environment requires the ability to adjust neural representations of sensory stimuli. Through pattern completion processes, cortical networks can reconstruct familiar patterns from degraded input patterns, whereas pattern separation processes allow discrimination of even highly overlapping inputs. Here we show that the balance between pattern separation and completion is experience dependent. Rats given extensive training with overlapping complex odorant mixtures showed improved behavioral discrimination ability and enhanced piriform cortical ensemble pattern separation. In contrast, behavioral training to disregard normally detectable differences between overlapping mixtures resulted in impaired piriform cortical ensemble pattern separation (enhanced pattern completion) and impaired discrimination. This bidirectional effect was not found in the olfactory bulb; it may be due to plasticity within olfactory cortex itself. Thus pattern recognition, and the balance between pattern separation and completion, is highly malleable on the basis of task demands and occurs in concert with changes in perceptual performance."

https://openalex.org/W2129034320,"Cachexia is characterized by inexorable muscle wasting that significantly affects patient prognosis and increases mortality. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis of this muscle wasting is of significant importance. Recent work showed that components of the forkhead box O (FoxO) pathway are increased in skeletal muscle during cachexia. In the current study, we tested the physiological significance of FoxO activation in the progression of muscle atrophy associated with cachexia. FoxO-DNA binding dependent transcription was blocked in the muscles of mice through injection of a dominant negative (DN) FoxO expression plasmid prior to inoculation with Lewis lung carcinoma cells or the induction of sepsis. Expression of DN FoxO inhibited the increased mRNA levels of atrogin-1, MuRF1, cathepsin L, and/or Bnip3 and inhibited muscle fiber atrophy during cancer cachexia and sepsis. Interestingly, during control conditions, expression of DN FoxO decreased myostatin expression, increased MyoD expression and satellite cell proliferation, and induced fiber hypertrophy, which required de novo protein synthesis. Collectively, these data show that FoxO-DNA binding-dependent transcription is necessary for normal muscle fiber atrophy during cancer cachexia and sepsis, and further suggest that basal levels of FoxO play an important role during normal conditions to depress satellite cell activation and limit muscle growth.—Reed, S.

The incremental utility of measuring regional fat deposition in association with metabolic syndrome (MS) has not been well described particularly in an elderly population.As part of the Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging, which is a community-based cohort study of people aged more than 65 years, subjects (287 male, 75.9±8.6 years and 278 female, 76.0±8.8 years) with regional body composition data using Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry for android/gynoid area, computed tomography for visceral/subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT/SAT), and cardiometabolic markers including adiponectin and high-sensitivity CRP were enrolled. We investigated the relationship between regional body composition and MS in multivariate regression models. Mean VAT and SAT area was 131.4±65.5 cm(2) and 126.9±55.2 cm(2) in men (P = 0.045) and 120.0±46.7 cm(2) and 211.8±65.9 cm(2) in women (P<0.01). Mean android and gynoid fat amount was 1.8±0.8 kg and 2.5±0.8 kg in men and 2.0±0.6 kg and 3.3±0.8 kg in women, respectively (both P<0.01). VAT area and android fat amount was strongly correlated with most metabolic risk factors compared to SAT or gynoid fat. Furthermore, android fat amount was significantly associated with clustering of MS components after adjustment for multiple parameters including age, gender, adiponectin, hsCRP, a surrogate marker of insulin resistance, whole body fat mass and VAT area.Our findings are consistent with the hypothesized role of android fat as a pathogenic fat depot in the MS. Measurement of android fat may provide a more complete understanding of metabolic risk associated with variations in fat distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2008818829,"After its release, the endocannabinoid anandamide is taken up from the synaptic cleft by internalization by neurons and astrocytes. Although several lines of evidence suggest that the anandamide uptake itself is a carrier-mediated diffusion process, the molecular identity of the transporter was unknown until now. Here Fu et al. show that anandamide uptake is mediated by a novel protein named FAAH-like anandamide transporter (FLAT) that is generated as an alternative splicing product of the fatty acid amide hydrolase-1 (Faah) mRNA. The endocannabinoid anandamide is removed from the synaptic space by a selective transport system, expressed in neurons and astrocytes, that remains molecularly uncharacterized. Here we describe a partly cytosolic variant of the intracellular anandamide-degrading enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase-1 (FAAH-1), termed FAAH-like anandamide transporter (FLAT), that lacked amidase activity but bound anandamide with low micromolar affinity and facilitated its translocation into cells. Known anandamide transport inhibitors, such as AM404 and OMDM-1, blocked these effects. We also identified a competitive antagonist of the interaction of anandamide with FLAT, the phthalazine derivative ARN272, that prevented anandamide internalization in vitro, interrupted anandamide deactivation in vivo and exerted profound analgesic effects in rodent models of nociceptive and inflammatory pain, which were mediated by CB1 cannabinoid receptors. The results identify FLAT as a critical molecular component of anandamide transport in neural cells and a potential target for therapeutic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2127762602,"Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) activates unfolded protein response (UPR) transducers, such as PERK and OASIS, in osteoblast cells. ATF6, a bZIP transcription factor, is also a UPR transducer. However, the involvement of ATF6 in BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, BMP2 treatment was shown to markedly induce the expression and activation of ATF6 with an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and OC expression in MC3T3E1 cells. In contrast, ATF6 activation by BMP2 was not observed in the Runx2(-/-) primary calvarial osteoblasts, and Runx2 overexpression recovered BMP2 action. BMP2 stimulated ATF6 transcription by enhancing the direct binding of Runx2 to the osteoblast-specific cis-acting element 2 (OSE2, ACCACA, -205 to -200 bp) motif of the Atf6 promoter region. In addition, the overexpression of ATF6 increased the Oc promoter activity by enhancing the direct binding to a putative ATF6 binding motif (TGACGT, -1126 to -1121 bp). The inhibition of ATF6 function with the dominant negative form of ATF6 (DN-ATF6) blocked BMP2- or Runx2-induced OC expression. Interestingly, OASIS, which is structurally similar to ATF6, did not induce Oc expression. ALP and Alizarin red staining results confirmed that BMP2-induced matrix mineralization was also dependent on ATF6 in vitro. Overall, these results suggest that BMP2 induces osteoblast differentiation through Runx2-dependent ATF6 expression, which directly regulates Oc transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2122684024,"The polarized distribution of neuronal proteins to axons and dendrites relies on microtubule-binding proteins such as CRMP, directed motors such as the kinesin UNC-104 (Kif1A) and diffusion barriers such as ankyrin. The causative relationships among these molecules are unknown. We show here that Caenorhabditis elegans CRMP (UNC-33) acts early in neuronal development, together with ankyrin (UNC-44), to organize microtubule asymmetry and axon-dendrite sorting. In unc-33 and unc-44 mutants, axonal proteins were mislocalized to dendrites and vice versa, suggesting bidirectional failures of axon-dendrite identity. unc-44 directed UNC-33 localization to axons, where it was enriched in a region that resembled the axon initial segment. unc-33 and unc-44 were both required to establish the asymmetric dynamics of axonal and dendritic microtubules; in their absence, microtubules were disorganized, the axonal kinesin UNC-104 invaded dendrites, and inappropriate UNC-104 activity randomized axonal protein sorting. We suggest that UNC-44 and UNC-33 direct polarized sorting through their global effects on neuronal microtubule organization."
https://openalex.org/W2120655184,"Somatic copy-number alterations (SCNA) are a hallmark of many cancer types, but the mechanistic basis underlying their genome-wide patterns remains incompletely understood. Here we integrate data on DNA replication timing, long-range interactions between genomic material, and 331,724 SCNAs from 2,792 cancer samples classified into 26 cancer types. We report that genomic regions of similar replication timing are clustered spatially in the nucleus, that the two boundaries of SCNAs tend to be found in such regions, and that regions replicated early and late display distinct patterns of frequencies of SCNA boundaries, SCNA size and a preference for deletions over insertions. We show that long-range interaction and replication timing data alone can identify a significant proportion of SCNAs in an independent test data set. We propose a model for the generation of SCNAs in cancer, suggesting that data on spatial proximity of regions replicating at the same time can be used to predict the mutational landscapes of cancer genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2123595291,"The endocannabinoid system is known to regulate neural progenitor (NP) cell proliferation and neurogenesis. In particular, CB2 cannabinoid receptors have been shown to promote NP proliferation. As CB2 receptors are not expressed in differentiated neurons, CB2-selective agonists are promising candidates to manipulate NP proliferation and indirectly neurogenesis by overcoming the undesired psychoactive effects of neuronal CB1 cannabinoid receptor activation. Here, by using NP cells, brain organotypic cultures, and in vivo animal models, we investigated the signal transduction mechanism involved in CB2 receptor-induced NP cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Exposure of hippocampal HiB5 NP cells to the CB2 receptor-selective agonist HU-308 led to the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, which, by inhibiting its downstream target p27Kip1, induced NP proliferation. Experiments conducted with the CB2 receptor-selective antagonist SR144528, inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 axis, and CB2 receptor transient-transfection vector further supported that CB2 receptors control NP cell proliferation via activation of mTORC1 signaling. Likewise, CB2 receptor engagement induced cell proliferation in an mTORC1-dependent manner both in embryonic cortical slices and in adult hippocampal NPs. Thus, HU-308 increased ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation and 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine incorporation in wild-type but not CB2 receptor-deficient NPs of the mouse subgranular zone. Moreover, adult hippocampal NP proliferation induced by HU-308 and excitotoxicity was blocked by the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. Altogether, these findings provide a mechanism of action and a rationale for the use of nonpsychotomimetic CB2 receptor-selective ligands as a novel strategy for the control of NP cell proliferation and neurogenesis.

Likewise, CB2 receptor engagement induced cell proliferation in an mTORC1-dependent manner both in embryonic cortical slices and in adult hippocampal NPs. Thus, HU-308 increased ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation and 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine incorporation in wild-type but not CB2 receptor-deficient NPs of the mouse subgranular zone. Moreover, adult hippocampal NP proliferation induced by HU-308 and excitotoxicity was blocked by the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. Altogether, these findings provide a mechanism of action and a rationale for the use of nonpsychotomimetic CB2 receptor-selective ligands as a novel strategy for the control of NP cell proliferation and neurogenesis. The endocannabinoids (eCBs) 5The abbreviations used are: eCBendocannabinoidKAkainic acidmTORC1mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1NSCneural stem cellNPneural progenitorp70S6K70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinaseS6ribosomal protein S6SGZsubgranular zoneVZ/SVZventricular/subventricular zone. 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide are lipid signaling messengers involved in the homeostatic control of a large variety of functions of the nervous system (1Katona I. Freund T.F. Endocannabinoid signaling as a synaptic circuit breaker in neurological disease.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Thus, eCBs are produced on demand by activated postsynaptic cells and, by acting as retrograde messengers, control neurotransmitter release through presynaptic CB1 cannabinoid receptors (2Heifets B.D. Castillo P.E. Endocannabinoid signaling and long term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2009; 71: 283-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). CB1 constitutes the most abundant neuronal G-protein-coupled receptor in some areas of the nervous system and is also involved in the control of neural cell proliferation/survival decision (3Galve-Roperh I. Aguado T. Palazuelos J. Guzmán M. Mechanisms of control of neuron survival by the endocannabinoid system.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2008; 14: 2279-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CB1 receptors exert a neuroprotective action, at least in part by controlling excessive glutamate release and excitotoxicity (4Marsicano G. Goodenough S. Monory K. Hermann H. Eder M. Cannich A.

In addition, they contribute to long term neuronal plasticity by promoting NP proliferation and excitotoxicity-induced neurogenesis (5Aguado T. Monory K. Palazuelos J. Stella N. Cravatt B. Lutz B.

The other type of cannabinoid G protein-coupled receptor, the CB2 cannabinoid receptor, is very abundant in some peripheral cells (e.g. lymphocytes and macrophages) and organs (e.g. spleen and thymus), and in the nervous system it is basically restricted to infiltrating immune cells and resident microglia/macrophages (8Stella N. Endocannabinoid signaling in microglial cells.Neuropharmacology. 2009; 56: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), oligodendrocyte progenitors (9Molina-Holgado E. Vela J.M.

Nonpsychoactive CB2 cannabinoid agonists stimulate neural progenitor proliferation.FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2405-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). CB2 receptors control the pro-inflammatory status of immune cells by modulating their Th1/Th2 phenotype, and this activity has important implications for neuronal survival under neuroinflammatory conditions occurring in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and Huntington disease, and upon acute ischemic brain injury (11Fernández-Ruiz J.

Endocrinol. 2008; 286: S91-S96Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because of the lack of undesired psychoactive effects of CB2-selective ligands, therapeutic approaches aimed at targeting CB2 receptors rather than CB1 receptors are likely candidates to promote neuroprotection and neurorepair (12Mackie K. Cannabinoid receptors as therapeutic targets.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 101-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). CB2 receptors are present in embryonic stem cells (13Jiang S. Fu Y. Williams J. Wood J. Pandarinathan L. Avraham S. Makriyannis A. Avraham S. Avraham H.K. Expression and function of cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 and their cognate cannabinoid ligands in murine embryonic stem cells.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e641Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) as well as in bone marrow-derived myeloid progenitors, in which they regulate cell proliferation and trafficking to the nervous system under neuroinflammatory conditions (14Palazuelos J.

CB1 and CB2 receptors are coupled to heterotrimeric Gi proteins, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (16Pertwee R.G.

In addition, CB1 receptors have recently been shown to modulate mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, which is in turn responsible for the cognitive impairment induced by Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the major active constituent of marijuana (17Puighermanal E. Marsicano G. Busquets-Garcia A. Lutz B. Maldonado R. Ozaita A. Cannabinoid modulation of hippocampal long term memory is mediated by mTOR signaling.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1152-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). mTORC1 is involved in the control of a plethora of cell functions by acting, for example, through the regulation of protein synthesis via phosphorylation of its downstream targets 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) (18Foster K.G.

Klann E. mTOR signaling: at the crossroads of plasticity, memory and disease.Trends Neurosci. 2010; 33: 67-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). In addition, mTORC1 is a major target of the PI3K/Akt pathway and thus also plays a central role in neural cell survival/death decision (18Foster K.G. Fingar D.C. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR): conducting the cellular signaling symphony.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14071-14077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). For example, status epilepticus activates mTORC1, and this is required for the hippocampal alterations that contribute to the development of epilepsy, including mossy fiber sprouting, neuronal cell death, and neurogenesis (20Zeng L.H.

The endocannabinoid system and neurogenesis in health and disease.Neuroscientist. 2007; 13: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), here we investigated the signaling mechanism by which CB2 receptors control NP cell proliferation and, in particular, the potential role of mTORC1 in this process. We show that CB2 receptors present in NPs exert a proliferative effect that relies on the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 axis and its downstream target p27Kip1. Furthermore, this CB2 receptor-induced NP proliferation via mTORC1 is relevant in pathophysiological conditions such as NP proliferation during cortical development and excitotoxicity-induced adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Founders of the CB2 receptor knock-out mice colony were kindly donated by Nancy Buckley (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) and were obtained by disrupting the CB2 receptor gene by using homologous recombination in the embryonic stem cell line 129 (23Buckley N.E.

The CB2 receptor-selective agonist HU-308 was kindly donated by Raphael Mechoulam (The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel) and the HiB5 cells by Zaal Kokaia (Lund Stem Cell Center, Sweden). The antibodies employed in this study are detailed in supplemental Table 1. Multipotent self-renewing progenitors were obtained from embryonic E14.5 wild-type and nestin-GFP mice and grown as described previously (5Aguado T. Monory K. Palazuelos J. Stella N. Cravatt B.

Clonal neurospheres were derived from nonadherent dissociated cultures of NPs (1000 cells/ml), and experiments were carried out with early (up to 10) passage neurospheres. The HiB5 hippocampal progenitor cell line was grown as described (24Renfranz P.J. Cunningham M.G. McKay R.D. Region-specific differentiation of the hippocampal stem cell line HiB5 upon implantation into the developing mammalian brain.Cell. 1991; 66: 713-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. HiB5 cell cultures were incubated in 5% CO2 at 33 °C, the proliferation-permissive temperature of the oncogenic tsA58 allele of the SV40 large T antigen. Incubation at 37 °C results in loss of proliferative capacity and neural differentiation. For Western blot and immunostaining analyses, HiB5 cells were pretreated with SR144528 (2 μm), LY-294,002 (5 μm), Akt inhibitor 1 (5 μm), rapamycin (50 nm), or PD98059 (10 μm) (10Palazuelos J.

Stock solutions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. No significant influence of dimethyl sulfoxide on any of the parameters determined was observed at the final concentration used (0.1% v/v). Control incubations included the corresponding vehicle content. Neurosphere generation experiments were performed in 96-well dishes with 100 μl of medium. Neurospheres were pretreated with rapamycin (50 nm) for 30 min and then cultured in the continuous presence of HU-308 (50 nm) for 3 days. Subsequently the number of neurospheres per well was quantified. HiB5 cells were passaged, maintained, and analyzed at 33 °C. HiB5 cells were pretreated with SR144528 (2 μm) or rapamycin for 30 min, cultured in the continuous presence of HU-308 (50 nm) for 16 h, and with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 100 μg/ml) for 30 min followed by immunostaining. For cell cycle exit experiments, HiB5 cells were incubated with BrdU (100 μg/ml) for 30 min, treated with the indicated drugs for 48 h, and followed by immunostaining with rat monoclonal anti-BrdU and rabbit polyclonal anti-Ki-67 antibodies (supplemental Table 1). For flow cytometry analysis, HiB5 cells were trypsinized, permeabilized, and fixed in 1% (w/v) of bovine serum albumin and 30% ethanol/PBS and labeled with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Fluorescence intensity was analyzed by using an LSR flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Ten thousand cells per analysis were recorded. HiB5 cells were transiently transfected 1 day after plating with 1 μg of pCMV6 mouse CB2 receptor-expressing vector or empty vector (Origene, Rockville, MD) by using Lipofectamine 2000 following the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Cortical brain slices were obtained from E14.5 mice and cultured under semidry conditions in neurobasal medium, B27 (1%), N2 (1%), glutamine (1%), penicillin/streptomycin (1%), fungizone (1%), and ciprofloxacine (5 μg/ml) as described previously (25Mulder J.

Brain slices were treated with the indicated drugs for 1 or 16 h and subsequently incubated with BrdU for 1 h. At the end of the experiment, brain slices were processed in 10-μm sections, and slice sections from equivalent regions of the rostral to caudal axis were analyzed by immunofluorescence. RNA was obtained with the RNeasy Protect kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using the RNase-free DNase kit and cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science). Amplification of cDNA was performed with the specific primers indicated in supplemental Table 2. CB2 receptor PCRs were performed using the following conditions: 1 min at 95 °C and 35 cycles (30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C). Finally, after a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min, PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels. The rest of the transcripts were detected as described previously (6Aguado T. Romero E.

Cleared cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After incubation with the correspondent primary antibodies (supplemental Table 1), blots were developed with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit. Loading controls were performed with an anti-α-tubulin antibody. Densitometric quantification of the luminograms was performed using a GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad) and MultiAnalyst software (Bio-Rad). Animal procedures were performed according to the European Union guidelines (86/609/EU) for the use of laboratory animals. Mice were housed (five per cage) with food and water available ad libitum and maintained in a temperature-controlled environment on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Adult CB2 receptor knock-out mice (8 weeks old) and their respective wild-type littermates were obtained from heterozygote crosses (26Palazuelos J. Aguado T. Pazos M.R. Julien B. Carrasco C. Resel E.

Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 mg/kg BrdU and vehicle (150 μl of PBS supplemented with 0.5 mg of defatted bovine serum albumin and 4% dimethyl sulfoxide) or 15 mg/kg HU-308, either alone or in combination with vehicle (150 μl PBS), or 6 mg/kg rapamycin (injected 30 min before vehicle/HU-308) daily for 5 days and perfused at either day 1 or 30 days later. For short term experiments, wild-type mice were administered a single intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg BrdU and vehicle (150 μl PBS) or HU-308 (15 mg/kg) and perfused 3 h later. Kainate-induced excitotoxicity experiments were performed as described previously (6Aguado T. Romero E. Monory K. Palazuelos J. Sendtner M. Marsicano G. Lutz B. Guzmán M. Galve-Roperh I.

Animals were given a single injection of vehicle (150 μl PBS) or kainic acid (KA; 15 mg/kg) on the 1st day of treatment, alone or together with rapamycin, and sacrificed after 5 or 30 days. Fixed cell cultures, embryonic organotypic cortical sections (10 μm) attached to poly-l-lysine-coated slides, and adult coronal free-floating brain sections (30 μm) were processed as described (26Palazuelos J.

Briefly, after a 1-h blockade with PBS supplemented with 0.25% Triton X-100 and 10% goat serum, brain sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated primary antibodies (supplemental Table 1), followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies. The appropriate mouse, rat, and rabbit highly cross-adsorbed AlexaFluor 488, AlexaFluor 594, and AlexaFluor 647 secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were used. Confocal fluorescence images were acquired by using Leica TCS-SP2 software (Wetzlar, Germany) and SP2 microscope with two passes by Kalman filter and a 1024X1024 collection box. In slices, the number of BrdU+, phospho-p27Kip1+, and phospho-S6 highly immunoreactive positive cells present in the VZ/SVZ of the developing cortex was quantified, after image conversion to grayscale, in ImageJ by using the threshold tool and normalized to the total area selected for quantification. In adult mice, BrdU- and phospho-S6-positive cells were quantified in the SGZ of the hippocampus in a minimum of five coronal sections per animal. A 1-in-10 series of hippocampal sections located between 1.3 and 2.5 mm posterior to bregma were analyzed, and positive cells were normalized to the SGZ area determined with ×10 objective. The absolute number of positive cells was calculated considering the total hippocampal volume as determined by the sum of the areas of the sampled sections multiplied by the distances between them. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Significant differences between the groups were evaluated using an analysis of variance test followed by a Bonferroni post hoc comparison in the case of parametric population and Mann-Whitney test in the case of nonparametric populations. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. NP cells have been shown to express CB2 receptors in both neurosphere-derived progenitor cells and human/murine NSC lines (10Palazuelos J. Aguado T. Egia A. Mechoulam R. Guzmán M. Galve-Roperh I.

Neurosci. 2007; 25: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To investigate the signal transduction mechanism of CB2 receptors in NP cell proliferation, we first employed the HiB5 rat NP line (24Renfranz P.J. Cunningham M.G. McKay R.D. Region-specific differentiation of the hippocampal stem cell line HiB5 upon implantation into the developing mammalian brain.Cell. 1991; 66: 713-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). HiB5 cells cultured in proliferating conditions (33 °C) express CB2 receptors, and after differentiation for 3 days at the restrictive temperature (37 °C), their expression was significantly reduced (supplemental Fig. 1). CB1 receptors were also present in HiB5 cells but with an opposite pattern of expression, as CB1 transcript levels increased with neural differentiation. In addition, transcripts of the putative eCB receptor GPR55 were also present in HiB5 cells, but their levels did not change with the differentiation status of the cells. CB2 receptors are known to be coupled to PI3K/Akt and ERK activation (9Molina-Holgado E. Vela J.M. Arévalo-Martín A. Almazán G. Molina-Holgado F. Borrell J. Guaza C.

Nonpsychoactive CB2 cannabinoid agonists stimulate neural progenitor proliferation.FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2405-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed their functional coupling to downstream signaling in proliferating HiB5 cells by treatment with the CB2-selective agonist HU-308 (27Hanus L. Breuer A. Tchilibon S. Shiloah S. Goldenberg D. Horowitz M. Pertwee R.G. Ross R.A. Mechoulam R. Fride E. HU-308: a specific agonist for CB(2), a peripheral cannabinoid receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 14228-14233Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). HU-308 (50 nm) induced a rapid Akt activation as evidenced by Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-Ser-473-Akt antibody, and this effect was prevented by the CB2-selective antagonist SR144528 (2 μm) (Fig. 1A). Likewise, HU-308 induced a time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of downstream targets of PI3K/Akt signaling, including p70S6K and its substrate the ribosomal protein S6, as well as 4E-BP1 (Fig. 1B). Phosphorylation of p70S6K at Thr-389 indicated the involvement of mTORC1 activity in HU-308 signaling, in agreement with the observed phosphorylation of S6 at Ser-235/236 and 4E-BP1 at Ser-37/46 (18Foster K.G.

https://openalex.org/W2019054821,"Entorhinal grid cells have periodic, hexagonally patterned firing locations that scale up progressively along the dorsal-ventral axis of medial entorhinal cortex. This topographic expansion corresponds with parallel changes in cellular properties dependent on the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih), which is conducted by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. To test the hypothesis that grid scale is determined by Ih, we recorded grid cells in mice with forebrain-specific knockout of HCN1. We find that, although the dorsal-ventral gradient of the grid pattern was preserved in HCN1 knockout mice, the size and spacing of the grid fields, as well as the period of the accompanying theta modulation, was expanded at all dorsal-ventral levels. There was no change in theta modulation of simultaneously recorded entorhinal interneurons. These observations raise the possibility that, during self-motion-based navigation, Ih contributes to the gain of the transformation from movement signals to spatial firing fields. Entorhinal grid cells have periodic, hexagonally patterned firing locations that scale up progressively along the dorsal-ventral axis of medial entorhinal cortex.

HCN1 channels set the scale for the brain's grid map Loss of HCN1 increases grid field size and grid spacing The proportion of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex is independent of HCN1 Increases in grid scale are accompanied by longer theta periods in stellate cells Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are place-modulated neurons with multiple firing fields covering the environment in a grid-like hexagonal array (Fyhn et al., 2004Fyhn M.

Burgess N. Evidence for grid cells in a human memory network.Nature. 2010; 463: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Despite frequent variation in the animal's speed and direction, the firing locations of the grid cells remain rigidly periodic, pointing to the MEC circuit as a possible neural element for path integration-based spatial navigation (Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T.

Consistent with this possibility, the spatial phase offset of neighboring grid cells remains constant across environments, and grid cells preserve their periodic structure in complete darkness (Fyhn et al., 2007Fyhn M.H.

In all environments, the spatial scale of the grid cells is organized topographically along the dorsal-ventral axis of the MEC (Brun et al., 2008Brun V.H. Solstad T. Kjelstrup K.B. Fyhn M.

Grid scale is characterized by the size of the individual firing fields as well as the distance, or spacing, between the grid vertices. Both grid field size and grid spacing increase progressively from dorsal to ventral MEC. The potential substrate underlying the topographical expansion of grid scale has remained unresolved. Grid patterns are thought to reflect the integration of position from instantaneous changes in the animal's velocity and direction (Burgess et al., 2007Burgess N. Barry C. O'Keefe J.

If this is true, the incoming velocity signals themselves or the transformation of these inputs to spatial signals must be anatomically graded. Recent in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp studies have found several dorsal-ventral gradients in properties of entorhinal stellate cells that may be candidates for a differential transformation. Resonant properties of these cells, such as the membrane-potential oscillation frequency, change from high frequencies in the dorsal part of MEC to low frequencies in the ventral part (Giocomo and Hasselmo, 2008aGiocomo L.M.

In addition, multiple temporal-integrative time constants of these cells increase from dorsal to ventral, such as the time constants of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and the spike after-hyperpolarization (Boehlen et al., 2010Boehlen A.

These observations point to resonant and temporal-integrative properties of postsynaptic stellate cells as candidate mechanisms for graded transformation of velocity signals along the dorsal-ventral axis of MEC. Resonance and temporal integration in entorhinal stellate cells share a common feature in their dependence on the hyperpolarization-activated cation current Ih, a current known to change topographically from dorsal to ventral MEC (Garden et al., 2008Garden D.L.

We used these physiological changes in HCN1 knockout mice to test the idea that changes in resonance or temporal summation determine grid scale in the MEC. To examine the contribution of h current-dependent single-cell properties to grid spacing, we recorded neural activity in the MEC of forebrain-restricted HCN1 knockout mice (KO) and matched littermate control mice (Nolan et al., 2004Nolan M.F.

The experimenters remained blind to the identity of the mouse group (KO versus control) until the data collection and preliminary analysis were completed. We obtained data from a total of 965 well-separated cells in layers II and III of MEC (434 in KO and 531 in control). Cells from these two layers were distinguished by the denser staining in layer II compared to layer III. The border between MEC and other cortical regions was determined from Nissl-stained sagittal brain sections (Figure S1 available online) and based on Menno Witter's atlas for the hippocampal and parahippocampal cortex (Kjonigsen et al., 2011Kjonigsen L.J. Leergaard T.B. Witter M.P. Bjaalie J.G. Digital atlas of anatomical subdivisions and boundaries of the rat hippocampal region.Front. Neuroinform. 2011; 5: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), as well as the Allen Brain Atlas. The average distance from the recording location to the dorsal border of MEC was 609 ± 16 μm in the KO group and 702 ± 10 μm in the control group (means ± SEM, range 1,000 and 1,100 μm, respectively; all data from the 100 cm box). KO and control mice were trained to run randomly in a 100 × 100 cm or 50 × 50 cm open field. Trials lasted 20–40 min in the 100 cm box and 10–20 min in the 50 cm box, allowing the mouse enough time to cover the environment sufficiently. The 50 cm box provided sufficient conditions for identifying head direction and border cells, but the box was too small for visualizing the periodicity of grid fields at all dorsal-ventral MEC levels (Figure S2). Further analysis of grid cells was therefore carried out in the 100 cm box (333 cells in KO and 319 in control). On average, for trials with grid cells, HCN1 KO mice ran slightly faster than control mice (KO = 11.84 ± .21 cm/s, control = 9.57 ± .28 cm/s), but the speed difference did not affect the group difference in grid spacing (Figure S3).Figure S3Speed Did Not Affect the Group Difference in Grid Spacing, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Scatterplots show grid spacing (left) and grid field size (right) as a function of running speed.

Even so, KO mice still showed significantly higher grid spacing and grid field size, compared to controls at all overlapping speeds. When a regression line was fit to the scatterplots for each group, the regression lines for both grid spacing and grid field size had a higher Y-intercept in HCN1 KO compared to control mice (grid field size: F(1,130) = 34.67, p < 0.001, η2 = .21; grid spacing: F(1,124) = 44.29 p < 0.001, η2 = .26), indicating a difference in grid scale regardless of speed differences.(B) Scatterplots showing that speed did not affect the preservation of a gradient in grid spacing in HCN1 KO mice.

Targeted mutation of HCN1 subunits did not reduce the number of grid cells. Grid cells were abundant in superficial layers of MEC (Figure 1). Spatial autocorrelation analysis confirmed the regularity and hexagonal pattern of the firing fields in these cells (Figures 1A and 1B). To estimate the proportion of grid cells, we performed a shuffling analysis on a cell-by-cell basis (Boccara et al., 2010Boccara C.N. Sargolini F. Thoresen V.H. Solstad T. Witter M.P. Moser E.I.

Grid cells were defined as cells with a grid score higher than the 99th percentile of shuffled data for the respective group, layer, and box size (Figures 1C and 1D). Using this criterion, in layers II and III of MEC we found 48 grid cells in control mice (15% of all cells) and 86 grid cells in KO mice (26% of all cells). The number of observed grid cells was significantly larger than expected by random selection from the shuffled distribution in both KO mice (layer II, Z = 42.88, p < 0.001; layer III, Z = 17.80, p < 0.001; binomial test with expected p value of 0.01) and control mice (layer II, Z = 21.95, p < 0.001; layer III, Z = 13.02, p < 0.001) (Figures 1C and 1D). There were significantly more grid cells in HCN1 KO compared to control (Z = 3.40, p < 0.001; layer II Z = .88, p = 39; layer III, Z = 2.53, p < 0.05; binomial test), but this was most likely due to uneven sampling within MEC across animals (Figure S4). There was no significant difference in the average firing rate of the grid cells in KO and control animals (2.09 ± .16 Hz and 2.16 ± .26 Hz, respectively; t(132) = .34, p = 0.73) or in the magnitude of their periodicity (grid scores of .66 ± .03 and .71 ± .03, respectively; t(132) = −1.04, p = 0.30).Figure S4Proportions of Cell Type for Control and Knockout Mice, Related to Figure 7Show full captionIndividual control (left) and KO mice (right) showed different proportions of grid cells, border cells and head direction cells, most likely due to slightly different coordinates sampling clusters of particular cell types.

Entorhinal cells in HCN1 KO mice had increased grid field size and grid spacing at all dorsal-ventral locations examined (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). To estimate the impact of the loss of HCN1 subunits, we fit a linear regression line to scatterplots showing either grid spacing (Figure 2B) or grid field size (Figure 2C) as a function of dorsal-ventral position in MEC. Both regression lines had a significantly higher Y intercept in HCN1 KO mice than in control mice, as determined by an analysis of covariance (grid spacing: F(1,124) = 83.71, η2 = .40, p < 0.001; grid field size: F(1,130) = 68.97, η2 = .35, p < 0.001), suggesting that grid scale is increased after loss of HCN1. To compare the steepness of the dorsal-ventral gradient in grid scale, we next determined the slope of the regression lines for the two groups. In the HCN1 KO mice, the correlation with grid spacing was r (77) = .47 (p < 0.001; Figure 2B) and the correlation with field size was r (84) = .44 (p < 0.001; Figure 2C). In the control mice, the respective correlations were r (46) = .45 (p = 0.001; Figure 2B) and r (46) = .44 (p < 0.01; Figure 2C). The slope of the gradient in grid spacing was not significantly different between the two groups (grid spacing: F(1,123) = 1.56, η2 = .01, p = 0.21; grid field size: F(1,129) = 3.57, η2 = .03, p = 0.06). The ratio between grid spacing and grid field size (spacing/field size) did not differ significantly between control and KO mice (3.26 ± .07 and 3.32 ± .06, respectively, t(124) = .68, p = 0.50), indicating that spacing and size scaled up proportionately with loss of HCN1. Separate analysis of layer II cells gave an identical result (Y intercept for grid spacing: F(1,91) = 81.68, η2 = .47, p < 0.001 and for grid field size: F(1,95) = 69.01, η2 = .42, p < 0.001; slope for grid spacing: F(1,90) = .07, η2 = .001, p = 0.79 and for grid field size: F(1,94) = .87, η2 = .01, p = 0.35). The number of cells and the spatial range of dorsal-ventral locations were too small to conduct a similar analysis on grid cells in layer III. The significant increase in the Y intercept and the lack of change in the slope indicate that HCN1 plays a specific role in determining the range of the gradient in grid scale.Figure 3Examples of Grid Field Size and Grid Spacing from Individual Control and HCN1 Knockout MiceShow full caption(A and B) Four different grid cells recorded from two control (A) and two HCN1 knockout (B) mice.

The increase in grid scale in HCN1 KO mice raises the possibility of an accompanying increase in the interspike interval.

Theta modulation of individual neurons was determined from the fast Fourier transform-based power spectrum of the spike train autocorrelation functions of the cells. A cell was defined as being theta modulated if the mean power within 1 Hz of each side of the peak in the 4–5 to 10–11 Hz frequency range was at least 3-fold greater than the mean spectral power between 0 Hz and 125 Hz. We observed theta modulation in 43.0% of grid cells in KO mice and 38.3% of grid cells in control mice. In grid cells, the interspike interval in the theta frequency range was significantly higher in KO mice than in control mice (control: 108.1 ± 2.4 ms, KO: 114.4 ± 1.6 ms; t(53) = 2.28, p < 0.05; Figure 5), indicating that larger grid spacing occurred in conjunction with a lower “intrinsic firing” frequency. This difference was most pronounced at higher speeds (20–30 cm/s; control: 101.4 ± 2.4 ms, KO: 112.4 ± 2.0 ms, t(53) = 2.53, p < 0.05; Figure 5B). The group difference in interspike intervals was observed only in principal cells; interspike intervals for theta-modulated entorhinal interneurons (71% of control and 79% of KO interneurons) were not different (control: 106.2 ± 2.3 ms, KO: 108.8 ± 3.3 ms; t(36) = .59, p = 0.56; 20–30 cm/s: control: 99.5 ± 3.12 ms, KO: 102.9 ± 3.5 ms, t(36) = .69, p = 0.50). The difference between principal cells and interneurons was not caused by differences in the size of the cell samples (55 versus 38 cells, respectively). The effect of sample size was addressed by repeated subsampling from the principal cell population, such that the number of cells (n = 38) was identical in the populations that were compared. Subsampling from the principal cell population yielded a larger effect size than in the interneuron population in 999 out of 1,000 permutations. As expected, theta rhythmicity was observed in the local field potential in both control and KO mice. The power percentage of theta was numerically higher in KOs compared to control mice, consistent with previous analysis of hippocampal theta in HCN1 KO mice (Nolan et al., 2004Nolan M.F. Malleret G.

The exact mechanisms as to how platelets influence blood-borne metastasis, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we used murine B16 melanoma cells to observe functional aspects of how platelets contribute to the process of hematogenous metastasis. We found that platelets interfere with a distinct step of the metastasis cascade, as they promote adhesion of melanoma cells to the endothelium in vitro under shear conditions. Constitutively active platelet receptor GPIIb/IIIa (integrin αIIbβ3) expressed on Chinese hamster ovary cells promoted melanoma cell adhesion in the presence of fibrinogen, whereas blocking antibodies to aνβ3 integrin on melanoma cells or to GPIIb/IIIa significantly reduced melanoma cell adhesion to platelets. Furthermore, using intravital microscopy, we observed functional platelet-melanoma cell interactions, as platelet depletion resulted in significantly reduced melanoma cell adhesion to the injured vascular wall in vivo. Using a mouse model of hematogenous metastasis to the lung, we observed decreased metastasis of B16 melanoma cells to the lung by treatment with a mAb blocking the aν subunit of aνβ3 integrin. This effect was significantly reduced when platelets were depleted in vivo. Thus, the engagement of GPIIb/IIIa with aνβ3 integrin interaction mediates tumor cell-platelet interactions and highlights how this interaction is involved in hematogenous tumor metastasis."

A role of ChlR1 helicase in sister chromatid cohesion was first evidenced by studies of the yeast homolog Chl1p; however, its cellular functions in DNA metabolism are not well understood. We carefully examined the DNA substrate specificity of purified recombinant human ChlR1 protein and the biochemical effect of a patient-derived mutation, a deletion of a single lysine (K897del) in the extreme C terminus of ChlR1. The K897del clinical mutation abrogated ChlR1 helicase activity on forked duplex or D-loop DNA substrates by perturbing its DNA binding and DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Wild-type ChlR1 required a minimal 5′ single-stranded DNA tail of 15 nucleotides to efficiently unwind a simple duplex DNA substrate. The additional presence of a 3′ single-stranded DNA tail as short as five nucleotides dramatically increased ChlR1 helicase activity, demonstrating the preference of the enzyme for forked duplex structures. ChlR1 unwound G-quadruplex (G4) DNA with a strong preference for a two-stranded antiparallel G4 (G2′) substrate and was only marginally active on a four-stranded parallel G4 structure. The marked difference in ChlR1 helicase activity on the G4 substrates, reflected by increased binding to the G2′ substrate, distinguishes ChlR1 from the sequence-related FANCJ helicase mutated in Fanconi anemia.

The biochemical results are discussed in light of the known cellular defects associated with ChlR1 deficiency. Superfamily 2 DNA helicases that contain an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) motif within the conserved helicase core domain have attracted considerable interest because they are implicated in the maintenance of genomic stability and genetically linked to human diseases (1Wu Y.

Among this group of Fe-S domain proteins, the XPD helicase is a component of the transcription factor IIH complex and required for nucleotide excision repair and transcription.

Interestingly, a newly discovered member of the Fe-S domain helicase family is the ChlR1 (also named DDX11) helicase genetically linked to Warsaw breakage syndrome (WABS) (12van der Lelij P. Chrzanowska K.H. Godthelp B.C. Rooimans M.A. Oostra A.B. Stumm M. Zdzienicka M.Z. Joenje H. de Winter J.P.

Genet. 2010; 86: 262-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The single patient with Warsaw breakage syndrome was observed to display severe microcephaly, pre- and postnatal growth retardation, and abnormal skin pigmentation. The WABS patient displayed a compound heterozygous K897del mutation in trans with a maternally inherited splice site mutation in intron 22 that leads to a premature stop codon in exon 23. This would lead to nonsense-mediated decay of the maternal allele and monoallelic expression of the K897del-containing allele. Thus, the only functional allele would be the K897del mutation that was inherited from the father and appears recessive (father was asymptomatic). Cells from the patient exhibit chromosomal instability characterized by sister cohesion defects, chromosomal breakage, and sensitivity to the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin and topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin (12van der Lelij P. Chrzanowska K.H. Godthelp B.C. Rooimans M.A. Oostra A.B. Stumm M. Zdzienicka M.Z. Joenje H. de Winter J.P.

Based on the cellular phenotypes, it was suggested that WABS represented a unique disease with cellular features of both Fanconi anemia and the cohesinopathy Roberts syndrome. A role of the ChlR1 helicase in sister chromatid cohesion was first evidenced by studies of the yeast homolog Chl1p. chl1 genetically interacts with two genes (CTF7/ECO1 and CTF18/CHL12) that function in sister chromatid cohesion (13Skibbens R.V. Chl1p, a DNA helicase-like protein in budding yeast, functions in sister-chromatid cohesion.Genetics. 2004; 166: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition to Chl1p, budding yeast require a specialized replication factor C (Ctf18/Dcc1/Ctf8) and DNA polymerase-associated Ctf4 to maintain sister chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods during mitosis (14Petronczki M. Chwalla B. Siomos M.F. Yokobayashi S. Helmhart W. Deutschbauer A.M. Davis R.W. Watanabe Y. Nasmyth K. Sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the alternative RF-CCtf18/Dcc1/Ctf8, the helicase Chl1 and the polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 is essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis II.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3547-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). chl1 was identified as a high copy suppressor of ctf18Δ spore lethality, and CHL1 was found to be essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis II (14Petronczki M. Chwalla B. Siomos M.F. Yokobayashi S. Helmhart W. Deutschbauer A.M. Davis R.W. Watanabe Y. Nasmyth K. Sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the alternative RF-CCtf18/Dcc1/Ctf8, the helicase Chl1 and the polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 is essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis II.J.

A dosage increase of chl1+ rescued the sensitivity of swi1Δ, a mutant of the “replication fork protection complex,” to agents that induce replicational stress, pointing toward a role of Chl1p in the maintenance of replication forks as a component of the S phase stress response.

Depletion of human (h) ChlR1 by RNA interference resulted in abnormal sister chromatid cohesion and a prometaphase delay leading to mitotic failure (17Parish J.L. Rosa J. Wang X. Lahti J.M. Doxsey S.J. Androphy E.J. The DNA helicase ChlR1 is required for sister chromatid cohesion in mammalian cells.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4857-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Consistent with its role in sister chromatid cohesion, hChlR1 was found to reside in a complex with cohesion factors (17Parish J.L. Rosa J. Wang X. Lahti J.M. Doxsey S.J. Androphy E.J. The DNA helicase ChlR1 is required for sister chromatid cohesion in mammalian cells.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4857-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Subsequent RNA interference studies with human cells showed that hChlR1 is required for proper chromosome cohesion at both the centromeres and along the chromosome arms and tight binding of cohesion complexes to chromatin (18Inoue A. Li T. Roby S.K. Valentine M.B. Inoue M. Boyd K. Kidd V.J. Lahti J.M.

Other studies showed a role of hChlR1 in the maintenance of replicating papillomavirus viral episomes by loading the E2 protein onto mitotic chromosomes (19Parish J.L. Bean A.M. Park R.B.

Cell. 2006; 24: 867-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To examine the potential importance of ChlR1 during development, a Ddx11 knock-out mouse was made (18Inoue A. Li T. Roby S.K. Valentine M.B. Inoue M. Boyd K. Kidd V.J. Lahti J.M. Loss of ChlR1 helicase in mouse causes lethality due to the accumulation of aneuploid cells generated by cohesion defects and placental malformation.Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1646-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Loss of ChlR1 in the mouse resulted in embryonic lethality. The authors concluded that the aneuploidy apparent in Ddx11−/− embryos was a consequence of sister chromatid cohesion defects and placental malformation; however, the precise molecular pathways whereby ChlR1 maintains genomic stability are not well understood. Compared with the wealth of genetic information, only limited biochemical studies of ChlR1 have been performed to date. Hirota and Lahti (20Hirota Y. Lahti J.M. Characterization of the enzymatic activity of hChlR1, a novel human DNA helicase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 917-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) purified recombinant hChlR1 from insect cells and showed that it is a DNA-dependent ATPase and that it unwinds partial duplex DNA substrates with low processivity and a preferred 5′ to 3′ directionality. More recently, Hurwitz and co-workers (21Farina A. Shin J.H. Kim D.H. Bermudez V.P. Kelman Z. Seo Y.S. Hurwitz J. Studies with the human cohesin establishment factor, ChlR1. Association of ChlR1 with Ctf18-RFC and Fen1.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20925-20936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) purified a recombinant FLAG-tagged hChlR1 expressed in human 293 cells and confirmed its DNA-dependent ATPase activity and 5′ to 3′ helicase directionality. In the presence of replication protein A or the Ctf18-replication factor C complex, hChlR1 could unwind longer duplexes of 500 base pairs. hChlR1 was shown to interact with Ctf18-replication factor C, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and FEN-1, and hChlR1 stimulated FEN-1 endonuclease activity on an equilibrating flap DNA structure, a model substrate intermediate that forms during lagging strand synthesis (21Farina A. Shin J.H. Kim D.H. Bermudez V.P. Kelman Z. Seo Y.S. Hurwitz J. Studies with the human cohesin establishment factor, ChlR1. Association of ChlR1 with Ctf18-RFC and Fen1.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20925-20936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the involvement of ChlR1 in lagging strand processing during cellular DNA replication may be important for sister chromatid cohesion. The Timeless-Tipin protein complex that is implicated in replication fork stabilization and sister chromatid cohesion also interacts with ChlR1 (22Leman A.R. Noguchi C. Lee C.Y. Noguchi E. Human Timeless and Tipin stabilize replication forks and facilitate sister-chromatid cohesion.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 660-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), supporting the notion that the DNA helicase collaborates with other factors to maintain a fork structure conducive to establishment of cohesion. To better understand the molecular functions of hChlR1 that might be relevant to its roles in sister chromatid cohesion or resistance to agents that induce replication stress, we carefully examined its substrate specificity on a variety of DNA structures. These efforts revealed novel aspects of hChlR1 helicase function pertaining to its tail length requirements for unwinding simple duplex DNA and its ability to efficiently unwind a recombination intermediate D-loop structure as well as G4 DNA, the latter of which is proposed to affect normal cellular DNA metabolic processes such as replication. A WABS patient-derived ChlR1 mutation residing in the extreme C terminus of the protein negatively affected its biochemical functions including its ability to unwind simple duplex or G-quadruplex DNA, suggesting that the helicase function of ChlR1 is likely to be important in vivo. The biochemical findings will be discussed in light of the known cellular defects associated with ChlR1 deficiency. Human ChlR1 cDNA in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), kindly provided by Dr. Jill M. Lahti (Department of Genetics and Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN), was subjected to PCR amplification using primers ChlR1-F-HindIII and ChlR1-R-XhoI (supplemental Table S1). The PCR product, which includes an extra His6 sequence at the N terminus and 3× FLAG tag at the C terminus, was cloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of pcDNA3. The K50R and K897del mutations were generated by a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions using the designed mutagenic primers shown in supplemental Table S1 and the plasmid pcDNA3–6XHis-ChlR1–3XFLAG. All plasmids were sequenced to verify that no undesired mutations were introduced during PCR and cloning. Expression and purification of hChlR1 protein was based on the procedure of Hurwitz and co-workers (21Farina A. Shin J.H. Kim D.H. Bermudez V.P. Kelman Z. Seo Y.S. Hurwitz J.

Briefly, pcDNA3–6XHis-ChlR1–3XFLAG was transfected into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Six 10-cm plates of cells (∼1 × 107 cells/plate) were transfected. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection by trypsinization and centrifugation. Pelleted cells were washed with cold PBS and cold PBS with proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) sequentially, resuspended in 5 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), proteinase inhibitors), and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization (20 strokes), and the mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 2,400 × g. The supernatant (cytosol fraction) was collected and kept on ice; the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of nuclear buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, proteinase inhibitors) and incubated with rocking at 4 °C for 30 min. The cytosolic and nuclear fractions were combined together and centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 43,500 × g. The supernatant (∼10 ml) was incubated with 0.5 ml of FLAG M2-agarose resin (Sigma) in FLAG buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, proteinase inhibitors) at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was then washed twice with high salt FLAG buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, proteinase inhibitors) followed by one washing with FLAG buffer. ChlR1 protein was eluted with 4 μg/ml 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) in elution buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, proteinase inhibitors) for 1 h at 4 °C. The FLAG-tagged ChlR1 protein was then dialyzed at 4 °C for 2 h against elution buffer using a dialysis tube with a 50-kDa molecular mass cutoff (Tube-O-DIALYZERTM). Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Purified recombinant ChlR1 proteins were analyzed for purity by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie staining. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay using BSA as a standard.

Reactions were quenched with the addition of 20 μl of 2× stop buffer (17.5 mm EDTA, 0.3% SDS, 12.5% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 0.02% xylene cyanol). For standard duplex DNA substrates, a 10-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide with the same sequence as the labeled strand was included in the quench to prevent reannealing. Unlabeled oligonucleotide was omitted in the quench for helicase reactions with the HJ(X12) and D-loop substrates. The products of the helicase reactions for duplex DNA substrates and D-loop substrate were resolved on non-denaturing 12% (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gels. Products of G4 unwinding reactions were resolved on 8% (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gels with 10 mm KCl in the gel and the running buffer. Radiolabeled DNA species in polyacrylamide gels were visualized using a PhosphorImager and quantitated using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). The percentage of helicase substrate unwound was calculated by using the following formula: Percent unwinding = 100 × (P/(S + P)) where P is the product and S is the substrate. The values of P and S were corrected after subtracting background values in the no-enzyme and heat-denatured substrate controls, respectively. Protein/DNA binding mixtures (20 μl) contained the indicated concentrations of ChlR1 and a 0.5 nm concentration of the specified 32P-end-labeled DNA substrate in the same reaction buffer as that used for helicase assays (see above) containing 1 mm ATPγS or no nucleotide. The binding mixtures were incubated on ice for 30 min after the addition of hChlR1. After incubation, 3 μl of loading dye (74% glycerol, 0.01% xylene cyanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) was added to each mixture, and samples were resolved on native 5% (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gels at 200 V for 2 h at 4 °C. For G4 DNA binding experiments, 5% polyacrylamide gels were used, and running buffer contained 10 mm KCl. The radiolabeled species were visualized using a PhosphorImager and analyzed with ImageQuant software. The dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated by Scatchard analysis using Prism (GraphPad Software). ATP hydrolysis was measured using [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and analysis by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Mallinckrodt Baker). The standard reaction mixture (20-μl total volume) contained 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 25 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 250 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and 60 nm hChlR1 protein and was incubated at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched with 50 mm EDTA (final concentration). The reaction mixture was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate and resolved by using 0.5 m LiCl, 1 m formic acid as the carrier solvent. The TLC plate was exposed to a phosphorimaging cassette for 1 h, visualized using a PhosphorImager, and analyzed with ImageQuant software. For experiments to determine Km(ATP), M13mp18 ssDNA was 2.1 nm, the concentration of ATP ranged from 31 to 8000 μm, and the reaction was incubated for 30 min. For determination of kcat, the concentration of ATP was 8.5 mm. Five-microliter aliquots were removed and quenched with 5 μl of 0.1 m EDTA at 0, 7.5, 15, 30, and 45 min, respectively. For determination of Keff, the M13mp18 ssDNA concentration ranged from 0 to 10.6 nm, and the reaction was incubated for 30 min. The kinetic parameters were calculated by Enzyme Kinetics 1.3 (SigmaPlot, Systat Software Inc.) using the Michaelis-Menten equation. All experiments were repeated at least three times with standard deviation (S.D.) indicated by error bars. The ATP binding assay (30 μl) was performed in the same reaction buffer as for the helicase or ATPase assay described above with 5μCi of [α-32P] ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Assays were initiated by adding hChlR1 protein to a final concentration of 230 nm followed by incubating for 30 min at the indicated temperature. Reactions were then applied to Bio-Spin P30 Tris chromatography columns (Bio-Rad), which had been pre-equilibrated in a reaction buffer. One-drop (∼45 μl) fractions were collected as flow-through under gravity from the column that was eluted with Tris-EDTA. The specific radioactivity of each fraction was determined by a liquid scintillation counter (MicroBeta TriLux, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The first peak (three to four drops) was considered as protein-bound ATP, and the second peak was considered as unbound ATP. Streptavidin displacement reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 25 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, 10 fmol of the specified DNA substrate (0.5 nm), and the indicated concentrations of hChlR1 protein. For streptavidin displacement reactions, 10 fmol of DNA substrate was preincubated with 100 nm streptavidin (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C. Streptavidin bound to the DNA substrate was detected by a slower migrating gel-shifted species on nondenaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel. Reactions were initiated by adding hChlR1"
https://openalex.org/W2085423949,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) into myofibroblasts contributes to the establishment of fibrosis that leads to end stage renal disease. FGF-2 induces EMT in PTECs. Because the interaction between FGF-2 and its receptor is mediated by heparan sulfate (HS) and syndecans, we speculated that a deranged HS/syndecans regulation impairs FGF-2 activity. Heparanase is crucial for the correct turnover of HS/syndecans. The aim of the present study was to assess the role of heparanase on epithelial-mesenchymal transition induced by FGF-2 in renal tubular cells. In human kidney 2 (HK2) PTEC cultures, although FGF-2 induces EMT in the wild-type clone, it is ineffective in heparanase-silenced cells. The FGF-2 induced EMT is through a stable activation of PI3K/AKT which is only transient in heparanase-silenced cells. In PTECs, FGF-2 induces an autocrine loop which sustains its signal through multiple mechanisms (reduction in syndecan-1, increase in heparanase, and matrix metalloproteinase 9). Thus, heparanase is necessary for FGF-2 to produce EMT in PTECs and to sustain FGF-2 intracellular signaling. Heparanase contributes to a synergistic loop for handling syndecan-1, facilitating FGF-2 induced-EMT. In conclusion, heparanase plays a role in the tubular-interstitial compartment favoring the FGF-2-dependent EMT of tubular cells. Hence, heparanase is an interesting pharmacological target for the prevention of renal fibrosis."

Temporal difference (TD) learning models posit that these signals should be modulated by predictions, not only of magnitude but also timing of reward. Here we show that BOLD activity in the VTA conforms to such TD predictions: responses to unexpected rewards are modulated by a temporal hazard function and activity between a predictive stimulus and reward is depressed in proportion to predicted reward. By contrast, BOLD activity in ventral striatum (VS) does not reflect a TD RPE, but instead encodes a signal on the variable relevant for behavior, here timing but not magnitude of reward. The results have important implications for dopaminergic models of cortico-striatal learning and suggest a modification of the conventional view that VS BOLD necessarily reflects inputs from dopaminergic VTA neurons signaling an RPE.

Reward-related activity in VTA is modulated by time as predicted by TD models VS activity does not encode this TD reward prediction error VS codes variables that are specific to the task at hand—here time, and not reward Our findings have important implications for theories of reward-guided behavior Systems-level neuroscience has progressively advanced from descriptive approaches toward those that provide a more mechanistic understanding of the relationship between neural activity and behavior. A paradigmatic example is the characterization of a reward prediction error (RPE) emitted by dopaminergic activity, which provides the strongest link yet between computational explanations of behavior and neural data (Schultz et al., 1997Schultz W. Dayan P. Montague P.R. A neural substrate of prediction and reward.Science. 1997; 275: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (5993) Google Scholar). RPE theory derives from computational accounts of reinforcement learning that specify how an agent comes to learn the values of different actions and stimuli in a complex environment (Sutton and Barto, 1998Sutton R.S. Barto A.G. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998Google Scholar). One such account, temporal difference (TD) learning, describes how predictive stimuli are associated with later rewards via the propagation of an error function through successive states, or time steps. This error function, the RPE, reports the difference between observed and predicted rewards at that particular time. Strikingly, recordings from single dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) report activity that resembles this precise error function (Schultz et al., 1997Schultz W. Dayan P. Montague P.R. A neural substrate of prediction and reward.Science. 1997; 275: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (5993) Google Scholar, Waelti et al., 2001Waelti P. Dickinson A. Schultz W. Dopamine responses comply with basic assumptions of formal learning theory.Nature. 2001; 412: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Dopamine neurons signal unpredicted rewards but are silent when rewards are fully predicted, instead firing at the occurrence of the earliest predictive stimulus. When an expected reward is omitted, dopamine neurons depress their activity at the precise time that this reward should have occurred. Hence, when stimulus-outcome associations are precise in time, dopaminergic activity, like the TD error function, is precise in time (Hollerman and Schultz, 1998Hollerman J.R. Schultz W. Dopamine neurons report an error in the temporal prediction of reward during learning.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). By comparison, little is known about dopaminergic activity when the time between predictive event and resulting reward is imprecise. When the occurrence of reward is fully predicted, dopamine neurons show differential firing for equal rewards occurring at different times (Hollerman and Schultz, 1998Hollerman J.R. Schultz W. Dopamine neurons report an error in the temporal prediction of reward during learning.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, Fiorillo et al., 2008Fiorillo C.D. Newsome W.T. Schultz W. The temporal precision of reward prediction in dopamine neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 966-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). A similar dependence of an RPE on the precise time of reward delivery in the case of unpredicted or partially predicted rewards would have implications for the role of dopamine in learning. More specifically, such a signal would be most relevant in situations where the goal is to learn not only how much, but also precisely when, a reward will ensue. A temporal dependence for a dopaminergic RPE signal would also have implications for understanding striatal activity as measured by BOLD fMRI, where numerous studies report a correlation between the BOLD signal and RPE in learning studies (O'Doherty et al., 2003O'Doherty J.P.

BOLD responses reflecting dopaminergic signals in the human ventral tegmental area.Science. 2008; 319: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), technical limitations imaging this region have meant that it is consistently easier to test for such signals in the striatum. Indeed, a large VTA/SNc projection to the striatum has fostered an implicit assumption that activity here reflects a dopaminergic input (O'Doherty et al., 2004O'Doherty J. Dayan P. Schultz J.

Comparing the neural basis of monetary reward and cognitive feedback during information-integration category learning.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This temporal jitter has in all cases been ignored in the computation of the prediction error, subsequently found to correlate with striatal BOLD signal. Furthermore, even in cases where reward timings are fixed, recent observations suggest that the VS signal codes for a behavioral update as opposed to a value prediction error (Li and Daw, 2011Li J. Daw N.D. Signals in human striatum are appropriate for policy update rather than value prediction.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Consequently, these data raise an intriguing possibility that the striatum encodes a signal that is most relevant to the task at hand, even in situations where this does not correspond to a reward prediction error. Here, we used BOLD fMRI to test these ideas while human subjects performed a classical conditioning experiment where we introduced two crucial manipulations. First, we compared a situation in which the time-interval between conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US) was fixed, against a situation in which this time-interval was drawn randomly from a learned distribution. Subjects had no influence over the US (reward/no reward) in either type of trial. Second, we included instrumental trials where the subject was asked to guess when the US would be delivered. These were the sole trials where a subject's behavior could influence their eventual payment, but no immediate feedback was given on these trials. Hence, throughout the experiment the relevant variable for optimizing behavior was the timing, and not magnitude of the US. To maximize their accuracy on instrumental trials, subjects had to covertly track US timings during the classical conditioning trials, and compare their internal timing predictions with the experienced US timings. The variable relevant for future behavior was therefore divorced from immediately experienced reward magnitude. This allowed us to test two independent predictions. We hypothesized that the VTA would code for the time-dependent reward prediction error, as predicted by TD theory. By contrast, because in our task subjects had to learn when, but not how much, reward would occur, we hypothesized that striatal responses would code for timing information, independent of reward, that is informative in subsequent instrumental trials. Thirty subjects (17 females, 20–35 years of age, mean age 26.8 years), of which 28 were included in the analysis (see Experimental Procedures), performed a classical conditioning experiment (Figure 1) while undergoing BOLD fMRI. Subjects were pretrained that three abstract shapes (CS) signaled an outcome (US) of (a), 40p with 100% chance; (b), 0p with 100% chance; or (c), an uncertain outcome of either 40 or 0p with a 50:50 chance. Crucially, the color of the CS indicated whether the US would be delivered after a fixed or variable CS-US interval. Fixed CS-US intervals were always 6 s; variable intervals were drawn from a γ distribution with a mean of 6 s and a standard deviation of 1.5 s (range, 3–10 s). Overall 25% of trials were fixed and 75% of trials were variable. On one trial in seven (randomly interspersed—equally often on fixed and variable timing predicting trials), subjects were asked to press a button at the time they expected the outcome to appear. Subject's accuracy rate at predicting this time (to within 1 s) was multiplied by the free reward they received on all other trials in order to determine their overall final payment. Hence, although positive outcomes were rewarding, it was only through accurately estimating outcome delivery time that subjects could themselves exert a degree of control over their future payment. Subject's mean time estimate on instrumental test trials was close to the mean CS-US interval of 6 s (6.03 s ± 0.09 grand average over all test trials; 5.85 s ± 0.11 in test trials with variable timing CS; 6.22 s ± 0.09 in test trials with fixed timing CS), showing that participants had acquired an accurate representation of outcome timings and exploited the most rewarding policy. Average timing estimates did not differ significantly from 6 s (p > 0.7 across all test trials). As expected, in test trials with fixed timing CS, time estimates were less variable than in trials with variable timing CS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: p < 0.001, k = 0.23; see Figure S1 available online). Furthermore, time estimates were on average shorter in variable timing compared to fixed timing trials (t27 = 5.27, p < 0.001; Table S1). After careful preprocessing steps to minimize effects of subject motion and physiological artifacts (see Experimental Procedures and Figure S2), we identified a midbrain region in the vicinity of the VTA using a functional contrast. Our aim here was to test whether the VTA BOLD response coded for reward prediction errors in the fixed timing trials, and whether these responses were modulated by outcome time in variable timing trials. Consequently, we chose to identify the VTA using a contrast that was orthogonal to both these effects of interest and in so doing we avoided a potential selection bias. We contrasted unexpected rewards against unexpected zero outcomes in the variable timing trials, averaged across delivery times, in an anatomically restricted region of interest (ROI) around VTA (see Experimental Procedures). Using this ROI, we proceeded to test whether the VTA response for fixed trials showed the hallmarks of reward prediction error activity. Consistent with the profile seen in dopaminergic single unit recordings, we found that the BOLD response to the CS increased in proportion to the predicted reward magnitude of the trial (t test on regression slopes: t27 = 1.77; p = 0.05; pairwise one-tailed comparisons: 0p versus 0/40p: t27 = −2.44, p = 0.01; 0p versus 40p: t27 = −4.19, p < 0.001; 0/40p versus 40p: t27 = −2.47, p = 0.01), whereas the BOLD response to the US showed a marked increase for unexpected rewards (t27 = 4.30, p < 0.001, main effect of 40p US in 50:50 trials), and a difference between unexpected positive and zero outcomes (one-tailed t test: 40p versus 0p US in 50:50 trials: t27 = 1.75, p = 0.046; Figure 2). Next, we investigated VTA responses to variable CS-US timings. These should depend on the hazard function, namely, the probability that a reward will occur at a particular time given that it has not already occurred. In order to provide a strong test of this prediction, subjects were divided into two groups. In both groups, 40p outcomes were signaled at the time of delivery. In groupS (signaled group), 0p outcomes were also signaled. Hence, each successive time-step after the CS was more likely to contain an outcome (and thus a reward) as the subject knew that the outcome had not yet been delivered. The hazard function thus increased monotonically through the trial (Figure 3B ; inverted function shown in green). In groupU (unsignaled group), 0p outcomes were unsignaled. In this group, the passage of time initially increased the chances of imminent reward (as the peak delivery time approached), and then decreased these chances as it became increasingly likely that the crucial time had passed, resulting in a hazard function that was approximately quadratic and peaking at 6 s (Figure 3B; inverted function shown in red). Because of these group differences in hazard functions, we predicted different BOLD responses to an unexpected reward in the two groups (Figure 3B). We tested the two hazard functions on the BOLD response to unexpected rewards (for details regarding the general linear model [GLM] see Experimental Procedures). Parameter estimates for both hazard functions were extracted from the VTA ROI. In both groups, VTA data conformed to predictions: the monotonic hazard function predicted data from groupS (t13 = 2.60, p = 0.022), and the quadratic hazard function predicted data from groupU (t13 = 4.22, p = 0.001), but not vice versa (both p > 0.05; Figure 3C). Furthermore, this difference survived the stringency of a formal between-group comparison (ANOVA group × hazard function, F1,52 = 5.18, p = 0.027). Hence, in both groups an unexpected reward delivered early leads to a stronger response than an unexpected reward delivered at an expected time; however, an unexpected late reward only leads to a strong response in groupU, where the temporal hazard function decreases late in the trial. This effect can be seen in the raw BOLD time courses extracted from the VTA, plotted separately for short, middle and long CS-US intervals (Figure S3). Although we found that the BOLD response to the CS increased in proportion to the expected reward for fixed timing trials, there was no such effect for variable timing trials. There was a general increase in BOLD signal in response to variable cue onset (p < 0.001, t27 > 4.0) but this increase did not distinguish between the three reward conditions (p > 0.3; Figure S3). Overall, effects of variable timing cues showed a trend toward being smaller than those of fixed timing cues (t27 = 1.99, p = 0.057, comparing responses to any fixed timing CS to those evoked by any variable timing CS), rendering it possible that any effects were too small for such a scaling to be detectable. We note that some TD theories of dopaminergic function make the precise prediction that the cue effect will be diminished under conditions of variable timing (Daw et al., 2006Daw N.D. Courville A.C. Touretzky D.S. Representation and timing in theories of the dopamine system.Neural Comput. 2006; 18: 1637-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). If, in our task, BOLD signals in VS were simply a reflection of VTA output, then this signal should also bear the hallmarks of reward prediction error activity. We therefore first defined a region of interest in VS exactly as we had for VTA, by contrasting unexpected rewards against unexpected zero outcomes in the variable timing trials, averaged across delivery times. Strikingly, in the entire striatum there was not a single voxel that showed a significant increase to an unexpected reward across both groups (Figure S4B). This stood in distinct contrast to the large overlap of significant regions observed in the midbrain (Figure S4A) and was already suggestive of fundamental differences in processing between the two structures, a difference we now examine in detail. In defining a VS ROI, we therefore selected voxels that responded significantly to any fixed timing cue, and intersected these voxels with an anatomically-defined VS (Figure 4A , see Experimental Procedures). As was the case in the VTA, this functional contrast was selected to be orthogonal to every test performed in our study, hence eliminating the possibility of selection bias when performing statistical tests within and between regions. Note that the results reported below hold for alternative ROI definitions that are either anatomical or functionally identical across the two structures (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Unlike the VTA, our analysis of ventral striatal BOLD signal revealed significant differences between groups in responses to fixed timing trials. In groupU, responses to the CS scaled in proportion to predicted reward magnitude (t test on regression slopes fitted to the responses to a CS predicting 0p, 0/40p, or 40p: t13 > 5, p < 0.001), but this was not the case in groupS (p > 0.9). These differences held up when formally comparing the regression slopes between groups within the striatum (two-sample t test: t13 = 4.50, p < 0.001), and when comparing between VTA and striatum ROI (ANOVA ROI × group, F1,52 = 5.64, p = 0.021). These effects can be seen graphically in Figure 4B. Crucially, in groupU, a 40p reward was the only event that contained information about US timings and consequently a CS that was predictive of the occurrence of reward was also predictive of the occurrence of timing information. By contrast, in groupS, timing information was provided on every trial. Thus, across the two groups, ventral striatal activity was greatest to cues that best predicted information about event timing, whereas VTA activity was greatest to cues that best predicted greater reward. At the time of the US, there was no evidence for an RPE signal in either group (main effect of 40p US in 50:50 trials: p > 0.7; one-tailed t test 40p versus 0p US in 50:50 trials: p > 0.15; Figure 4B). Formal comparison with the RPE responses observed in VTA in fixed timing trials revealed a 2-way interaction (ROI × 40-versus-0p response: F1,108 = 4.58, p = 0.035). The absence of an RPE response was likewise observed in a ROI defined in the dorsal striatum and ventral putamen (see Figures S4F–S4K and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). As with the VTA, we next assessed the extent to which ventral striatal BOLD fluctuations to unexpected rewards depended upon a group-specific temporal hazard function. However, in the case of the VS, we could also assess the degree to which unexpected rewards elicited a larger response than unexpected zero outcomes on average across all variable timing trials. We could not perform this analysis for the VTA because this very contrast had been used to define the VTA ROI, and so would be subject to selection bias. In GroupU, where unexpected rewards also carry unexpected timing information, unexpected rewards led to an increase in VS activity (t27 = 3.69, p = 0.001, response to 40p versus 0p in 50:50 trials; Figure 4D). By contrast in groupS, where all events carry the same timing information, there was no difference in the average VS responses between rewarded and unrewarded variable timing trials (t27 < 1, p > 0.3; Figure 4D). Direct comparison between the effects observed in the two groups showed larger differences between responses to 40p versus 0p in groupU compared to groupS (2-way interaction: group × 40p-versus-0p response: F1,52 = 5.18, p = 0.026). Again, whereas the VTA responded to unexpected rewards, the VS responded to unexpected information about event timing. Furthermore, unlike in VTA, the BOLD signal to unpredictable rewards in variable timing trials did not conform with the group-relevant temporal hazard function (Figure 4C and Figure S4E) (ANOVA group × hazard function, F1,52 = 1.68, p = 0.28). Formal comparison with the VTA data revealed a three-way interaction (ROI × group × hazard function, F1,104 = 4.72, p = 0.032). The absence of an effect of the temporal hazard function was also true for dorsal striatum and ventral putamen (see Figures S4F–S4K and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In summary, at US time in variable timing trials, the only event that elicited a significant increase in VS activity was an unexpected reward in groupU—the only event that revealed unexpected timing information. To examine whether this response to unexpected timing information at US time was related to subject behavior, we performed two further analyses on BOLD responses to unexpected rewards in groupU. We assumed that, in order to perform well on test trials, subjects would covertly time the outcome in each trial. It is therefore conceivable that the VS response to the US in classical conditioning trials might reflect the accuracy of subjects' internal timing estimates and drive behavioral change. If the VS signal is monitoring task-performance then trials where the subject's prediction is more accurate than expected should elicit a large BOLD response at US time. By analogy, unexpectedly successful outcomes lead to high VS BOLD signal in many tasks. Here, the key measure of success is the subject's accuracy in predicting the US time. To test this hypothesis, we used each subject's mean timing estimate from instrumental test trials as an index of his or her internal prediction of outcome timing. We then examined the classical conditioning trials where the experienced US timing was closest (1/3 trials) to this internal US timing prediction (more accurate trials), and compared VS responses in these trials against those in all other trials (less accurate trials). As predicted, we found larger responses to more accurate trials (t13 = 2.76, p = 0.016; Figure 5A ). Furthermore, such a signal was not present in the VTA (p = 0.919) and direct comparison between VTA and VS revealed a trend for an interaction (ROI × accuracy: F1,52 = 3.57, p = 0.064). Second, if this VS response is a measure of covert timing performance then, after large VS responses, subjects should not change their timing estimates on subsequent test trials. Again, by analogy to more conventional tasks, high VS BOLD responses are associated with reselecting the same option on the following trial (Li and Daw, 2011Li J. Daw N.D. Signals in human striatum are appropriate for policy update rather than value prediction.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we calculated the change in subjects' timing guesses between one test trial and the next. We then examined VS responses in the classical conditioning trials that occurred between these test trials. Again we examined trials that led to the smallest (1/3 trials) behavioral change (smaller update trials), and compared VS responses in these trials against those in all other trials (larger update trials). As expected, we found larger responses to smaller update trials (t13 = 2.20, p = 0.046; Figure 5B). Again, such a signal was not present in the VTA (p = 0.22). Our data show that the BOLD signal from the VTA, but not the VS, is consistent with TD reward prediction errors both to conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. However, in situations with uncertain reward timing, TD theory also predicts that activity in the waiting period between CS and US will be depressed by continual small negative prediction errors, as each successive time bin fails to deliver a reward. This depression should be proportional to the predicted reward level and be more depressed for larger or higher probability predicted rewards. To examine this hypothesis, we modeled a constant ongoing negative reward prediction error in the time between CS and US in our variable timing trials (Figure 6A ). In the VTA, parameter estimates were both negative on average (one sample t test: t27 = −4.4, p < 0.001) and exhibited a trend toward being more negative in proportion to the CS reward probability (t27 = −1.5, p = 0.08; Figure 6B). Neither of these effects held true in the VS (p = 0.23, 0.75). Formal testing between structures revealed that this ongoing depression of activity was significantly greater in the VTA than the VS (two sample t test: t27 = −2.4, p = 0.01), and was modulated by the CS reward probability significantly more strongly in VTA than VS (t27 = −2.2, p = 0.02). Hence activity in the VTA alone, but not the VS, conformed with predictions from TD theory at cue time, while waiting for an outcome and at outcome time. H"

This process controls receptor-effector communication. However, the relationship between receptor endocytic trafficking and cell physiology is unclear. In MDA-MB-468 cells, cell surface EGF receptors (EGFRs) promote cell growth, whereas intracellular EGFRs induce apoptosis, making these cells an excellent model for studying the endocytic regulation of EGFR signaling. In addition, MDA-MB-468 cells have limited EGFR degradation following stimulation. Here, we report that in MDA-MB-468 cells the phosphorylated EGFR accumulates on the limiting membrane of the endosome with its carboxyl terminus oriented to the cytoplasm. To determine whether perturbation of EGFR trafficking is sufficient to cause apoptosis, we used pharmacological and biochemical strategies to disrupt EGFR endocytic trafficking in HeLa cells, which do not undergo EGF-dependent apoptosis. Manipulation of HeLa cells so that active EGF·EGFRs accumulate on the limiting membrane of endosomes reveals that receptor phosphorylation is sustained and leads to apoptosis. When EGF·EGFR complexes accumulated in the intraluminal vesicles of the late endosome, phosphorylation of the receptor was not sustained, nor did the cells undergo apoptosis. These data demonstrate that EGFR-mediated apoptosis is initiated by the activated EGFR from the limiting membrane of the endosome."
https://openalex.org/W2021958153,"Most excitatory synaptic terminals in the brain impinge on dendritic spines. We and others have recently shown that dynamic microtubules (MTs) enter spines from the dendritic shaft. However, a direct role for MTs in long-lasting spine plasticity has yet to be demonstrated and it remains unclear whether MT-spine invasions are directly influenced by synaptic activity. Lasting changes in spine morphology and synaptic strength can be triggered by activation of synaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and are associated with learning and memory processes. To determine whether MTs are involved in NMDAR-dependent spine plasticity, we imaged MT dynamics and spine morphology in live mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons before and after acute activation of synaptic NMDARs. Synaptic NMDAR activation promoted MT-spine invasions and lasting increases in spine size, with invaded spines exhibiting significantly faster and more growth than non-invaded spines. Even individual MT invasions triggered rapid increases in spine size that persisted longer following NMDAR activation. Inhibition of either NMDARs or dynamic MTs blocked NMDAR-dependent spine growth. Together these results demonstrate for the first time that MT-spine invasions are positively regulated by signaling through synaptic NMDARs, and contribute to long-lasting structural changes in targeted spines."

https://openalex.org/W2016996974,"Ample evidence suggests that almost all polypeptides can either adopt a native structure (folded or intrinsically disordered) or form misfolded amyloid fibrils. Soluble protein oligomers exist as an intermediate between these two states, and their cytotoxicity has been implicated in the pathology of multiple human diseases.

Proteins are the most abundant biological macromolecules present in all types of cells. They occur in a great variety of sizes, structures, and post-translational modifications, and fulfill an enormous range of important biological functions when in their native forms. However, misfolded proteins may arise by germline mutation, erroneous transcription, or translation, failure to fold properly, spontaneous denaturation, or physical damage (1Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3758) Google Scholar). More than two dozens aberrant polypeptides have been implicated in numerous human pathological conditions broadly referred as protein misfolding diseases (2Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 3Schnabel J. Nature. 2010; 464: 828-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Goldberg A.L. Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). The terminal misfolded proteins accumulate as amyloid fibrils, the insoluble stable aggregates that occur extracellularly or intracellularly. Despite the implication of specific proteins in certain diseases, increasing evidence supports the notion that all polypeptides have intrinsic properties that enable amyloid transformation. A recent genome-wide sequence survey identified the “amylome,” by which fibril-forming proteins constitutes roughly 15% of all coding polypeptides from Escherichia coli to humans (5Goldschmidt L. Teng P.K. Riek R. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 3487-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In fact, most proteins can be converted experimentally into amyloid under defined in vitro conditions (3Schnabel J. Nature. 2010; 464: 828-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Stefani M.

Bacteria assemble amyloids to form biofilm and spore structures that are critical for their survival and pathogenesis (8Fowler D.M. Koulov A.V. Balch W.E. Kelly J.W. Trends Biochem.

Moreover, peptide hormones form amyloid deposits during storage within mammalian secretory granules before being released, further implying that the protein amyloid form can serve beneficial biological functions (8Fowler D.M.

Therefore, the two states, i.e. native (folded or intrinsically disordered) and amyloid, can in principle be adopted by almost any protein under the appropriate conditions. The breakthrough discovery of soluble proteins oligomers provided a critical link between native proteins and their corresponding amyloid fibrils (14Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F.

Soluble protein oligomers are partially misfolded intermediates that are the precursors of insoluble amyloid. Two unique features of soluble protein oligomers distinguish them from nonspecific or other types of protein aggregates: first, they display inherent cytotoxicity toward live cells (14Bucciantini M.

In accordance with the notion that every protein can have two states, native proteins were shown to form oligomers under specific in vitro conditions where cytotoxicity is elicited (14Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). Therefore, soluble protein oligomers represent an intermediate stage of protein misfolding and are critically important, both biologically and pathologically. There is however limited information about how soluble protein oligomers participate in the process of amyloid formation. Assembly of natural soluble protein oligomers is seemingly an unfavorable and rating limiting event for eventual amyloid deposition, evidenced by high variability in the mostly late on-set protein misfolding diseases. These intermediates are believed to serve as the seed of nucleation to propagate the misfolding process of native proteins, which promotes the development of amyloid fibrils (2Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 20Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

Although natural amyloidogenic polypeptides, such as Aβ, can form oligomers in vitro, conversion of Aβ peptide to amyloid takes place spontaneously with an intrinsic kinetics (14Bucciantini M.

Soluble protein oligomers form transiently and co-exist with native and amyloid species. Therefore, it is difficult to conduct detailed mechanistic study on soluble protein oligomers without analyzing stable oligomeric species. A series of recent investigations indicate the potential involvement of non-proteinaceous cofactors with amyloidogenic proteins and related diseases.

In other experiments, CellTiter-Blue® dye was added to the cultures (1/5) for 4 h and fluorescence (560Ex/590Em) was measured by a spectrofluorometer (Jasco FP-6500), using the fluorescence of non-treated cells as 100% fluorescence. Native or oligomeric HSA (500 μg/ml) were mixed with PBS, heparin (500 μg/ml) or salmon sperm DNA (500 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were then deposited in wells of a positive charged Teflon printed slide, 8 well 6 mm diameter (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and air dried. Samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in water and stained with 1% Congo Red in 80% ethanol, 100 mm NaOH. Slide was washed in 80% ethanol, air dried, and analyzed microscopically in bright and polarized light using Olympus BX41 microscope. The secondary and tertiary structures of native and oligomeric HSA and IgG were probed by the analysis of their CD spectrum (Jasco J-810). Dialyzed proteins (200 μg/ml) in PBS were analyzed using near-UV (250–350 nm) and far-UV CD (200–260 nm) in a 1 mm path length quartz cuvette. Experimental data were corrected for buffer contributions. 5 μg of native or EDC-crosslinked HSA was incubated with 1 μg of trypsin for 60 min at 50 °C in PBS buffer containing 1 mm DTT. Samples were then separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with SimplyBlue™ SafeStain buffer. For positive control, HSA proteins were pre-boiled for 10 min in the digestion buffer prior to addition of trypsin. Different proteins were incubated with 0.5 μg of either circular plasmid DNA, genomic DNA or total RNA in TE buffer (10 μm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 and 1 μm EDTA) for 60 min. The samples were then loaded onto 1% agarose gel and subjected to electrophoresis separation. To demonstrate enzymatic protection, samples were treated with DNase I (40 ng/ml, Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min prior to electrophoresis. Protein samples (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated with either 0.2 mg/ml of DNA or 0.8 mg/ml of heparin (Lovenox, Sanofi-Aventis) in PBS for 24 h at 4 °C. The samples were placed on single-slot Formvar coated copper grids for 1 h. Excess samples were blotted with filter paper, the samples were stained with filtered 2% uranyl acetate for 1 min. Samples were allowed to dry before being examined under a JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA, Inc.) at an accelerated voltage of 80 kV. Digital images were obtained using the AMT Imaging System (Advanced Microscopy Techniques). Biotinylated IgG oligomer (5 μg/ml) was mixed with 5 μg/ml Alexa647-labeled DNA or Alexa647-labeled RNA for 30 min at 23 °C. The complexes were laid on poly-l-lysine precoated 1.5-mm round coverslips for 15 min, fixed in 5% formaldehyde for 15 min, washed three times in PBS, and then stained with Alexa488-labeled avidin diluted 1:100 in 0.1% saponin plus 10% FBS for 1 h at 23 °C. The complexes were washed three more times for 30 min with PBS, and the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides in ProLong® Gold antifade reagent. Slides were analyzed and images acquired using a confocal microscope (model TCS SP2, Leica) with a ×63 oil immersion objective. For a control in an independent project, we prepared bovine serum albumin (BSA) crosslinked with 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethyl-aminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). Surprisingly, EDC-crosslinked BSA induced profound cell death when added to cultured mammalian cells (supplemental Fig. S1). After repeated confirmation and a similar observation made with EDC-crosslinked mouse immunoglobulin, we decided to investigate the underlying mechanism. To do that, we crosslinked two common and abundant human proteins, human serum albumin (HSA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), with EDC. EDC is a zero-length crosslinking agent that effectively couples carboxyl groups to primary amines in acidic pH. After terminating the crosslinking reaction, HSA and IgG proteins were fully dialyzed against pH-neutral phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The protein preparations were soluble and contained a mixture of multimers that can be separated by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S2). We also prepared control protein samples of HSA and IgG proteins incubated at 65 °C in the buffer used for EDC crosslinking prior to dialysis against PBS. Heat treatment resulted in the visible precipitation of proteins in solution and the formation of multimeric aggregates (supplemental Fig. S2). When incubated with RPMI 8226 cells, a human plasmacytoma line, EDC-crosslinked HSA, but not native or 65 °C-aggregated HSA, induced severe cell death, as determined by the positive Trypan Blue staining (Fig. 1A). We further performed a CellTiter-Blue® cell viability assay to measure the metabolic capacity of the cells (Fig. 1B), and also stained the treated cells with PI (Fig. 1C) to confirm that the cytotoxicity was exclusively associated with EDC-crosslinked HSA. This protein preparation is also toxic to HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, A and B), Jurkat cells, CHO cells, and primary human peripheral mononuclear cells (data not shown). EDC-crosslinked human IgG displayed a similar effect on the viability of cultured cells (data not shown). To test the possibility that residual EDC in the protein preparation was responsible for the observed cellular effects, we incubated RPMI cells directly with EDC or the crosslinking buffer at a dose corresponding to their levels before sample dialysis but did not observe significant cytotoxicity (Fig. 1C). To examine the effect of EDC conjugation per se on the proteins, we further crosslinked HSA proteins that had been preincubated at either 65 or 100 °C with EDC. None of these preparations displayed significant cytotoxicity (Fig. 1C). To discern the factors in EDC-crosslinked proteins that mediate the cytotoxic effect, we performed size-fractionation of crosslinked HSA by chromatography (Fig. 1, D and E). Fractions containing monomer, dimer, trimer or higher oligomers were added to RPMI 8226 cell culture. HSA dimer (fraction 16) and a mixture of HSA trimer and tetramer (fraction 14) induced significant cytotoxicity (Fig. 1F). Fraction 12 with the highest cytotoxicity contains HSA multimers of high molecular weight (>250 kDa). In contrast, monomeric HSA isolated from EDC-crosslinked samples demonstrated limited cytotoxicity. Fractions with molecular weight significantly higher than fraction 12 somehow exerted less cell killing. These results suggest that the cytotoxic effect we observed with EDC-crosslinked samples is primarily mediated by the multimeric forms of proteins in the preparation. Given the fact that EDC-crosslinked proteins are soluble mixtures of multimeric polypeptides, we hypothesized that they may mimic soluble protein oligomers involved in amyloid formation with certain structural properties. Soluble oligomers of amyloidogenic proteins, such as Aβ, prion, lysozyme, and polyglutamine, commonly express a conformational structure that differs from that of both native proteins or amyloid fibrils (16Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3437) Google Scholar). We obtained an anti-Aβ oligomer antibody, A11, which is widely used to detect soluble protein oligomers, and found that it recognized EDC-crosslinked HSA, but not native HSA, by dot blot analysis (Fig. 2A). We further coated native, EDC-crosslinked or 65 °C-treated HSA on plastic surface in different doses and performed ELISA using the A11 antibody. Consistently, A11 dose-dependently bound to the EDC-crosslinked sample, but not to native or heat-aggregated HSA (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained with EDC-crosslinked human IgG (data not shown). To further understand the structural changes in EDC-crosslinked proteins, we employed a fluorescent dye, 4,4′-bis(1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulfonate) (bis-ANS), which preferentially binds to hydrophobic areas of a given structure. Both EDC-crosslinked and 65 °C-aggregated IgG, but not the native form, generated prominent fluorescent emission profiles with bis-ANS (Fig. 2C), indicating the presence of exposed hydrophobic regions in these protein preparations that are otherwise buried in natively folded structures. Comparison of native and EDC crosslinked proteins by far-UV (supplemental Fig. S3) and near-UV CD (supplemental Fig. S4) did not reveal significant change in the characteristic shapes of the spectra, suggesting that the proteins maintain somewhat native secondary as well as tertiary structures. Difference in the magnitude of CD signal upon crosslinking is likely due to slight differences in protein concentration. Nevertheless, when being compared with native HSA, EDC-crosslinked HSA was highly sensitive to trypsin digestion, albeit both proteins when fully denatured were equally susceptible to this protease (Fig. 2D). Together with bis-ANS binding, EDC-crosslinked proteins seemingly display features of structure misfolding. To reveal the relevance of EDC-cross-linked proteins to amyloid fibrils, we stained different IgG preparations with ThT, a fluorescent dye specifically reactive to β-sheet-rich amyloid (29LeVine 3rd, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). EDC-crosslinked IgG did not bind significantly to ThT, nor did native IgG. However, 65 °C-aggregated human IgG, which forms precipitant in solution, displayed strong ThT binding, indicating the presence of β-sheet-rich structure (supplemental Fig. S5). In short, EDC-crosslinked proteins are soluble, multimeric, have strong cytotoxicity, display a common conformational structure shared with other protein oligomers, exhibit structural alterations; but are not amyloid per se. Therefore, we consider them stabilized protein oligomers, which closely resemble the intermediate protein aggregates implicated in protein misfolding diseases. The soluble HSA oligomers we obtained by EDC crosslinking remained stable in PBS buffer, without any sign of spontaneous amyloid formation. We were intrigued by the reports that non-proteinaceous polyanionic cofactors, such as RNA and sulfated glycans, play an essential role in the infectivity of prions (30Rönnblom L.E. Alm G.V. Oberg K.E. J. Intern. Med. 1990; 227: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and hypothesized that these factors may somehow interact with misfolded proteins formed along the amyloid development pathway. As a positive control for our investigation, we obtained a prion fragment containing aa 106–126 that is both neurotoxic and amyloidogenic (31De Gioia L. Selvaggini C. Ghibaudi E. Diomede L. Bugiani O. Forloni G. Tagliavini F. Salmona M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7859-7862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The prion peptide readily bound to dsDNA in a gel shift assay (Fig. 3A), an interaction that conveys protection of DNA from DNase digestion (supplemental Fig. S6). However, a scrambled control peptide failed to bind or protect the DNA under the same conditions. Similarly, Aβ peptide, in contrast to a control peptide with reversed sequence, demonstrated the capacity to interact with DNA in vitro (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we confirmed the direct interaction between DNA and the prototypic amyloidogenic peptides, as previously published (32Silva J.L. Lima L.M. Foguel D. Cordeiro Y. Trends Bioc"
https://openalex.org/W2051263360,"There is increasing evidence that in several fungi, rhamnose-containing glycans are involved in processes that affect host-pathogen interactions, including adhesion, recognition, virulence, and biofilm formation. Nevertheless, little is known about the pathways for the synthesis of these glycans. We show that rhamnose is present in glycans isolated from the rice pathogen Magnaporthe grisea and from the plant pathogen Botryotinia fuckeliana. We also provide evidence that these fungi produce UDP-rhamnose. This is in contrast to bacteria where dTDP-rhamnose is the activated form of this sugar. In bacteria, formation of dTDP-rhamnose requires three enzymes. Here, we demonstrate that in fungi only two genes are required for UDP-Rha synthesis. The first gene encodes a UDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase that converts UDP-glucose to UDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose. The product was shown by time-resolved (1)H NMR spectroscopy to exist in solution predominantly as a hydrated form along with minor amounts of a keto form. The second gene encodes a bifunctional UDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose-3,5-epimerase/-4-reductase that converts UDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose to UDP-rhamnose. Sugar composition analysis and gene expression studies at different stages of growth indicate that the synthesis of rhamnose-containing glycans is under tissue-specific regulation. Together, our results provide new insight into the formation of rhamnose-containing glycans during the fungal life cycle. The role of these glycans in the interactions between fungal pathogens and their hosts is discussed. Knowledge of the metabolic pathways involved in the formation of rhamnose-containing glycans may facilitate the development of drugs to combat fungal diseases in humans, as to the best of our knowledge mammals do not make these types of glycans."
https://openalex.org/W2132676017,"Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by the loss of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) that features neurodegeneration and liver disease. Because ASMase-knock-out mice models NPD and our previous findings revealed that ASMase activates cathepsins B/D (CtsB/D), our aim was to investigate the expression and processing of CtsB/D in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) from ASMase-null mice and their role in liver fibrosis. Surprisingly, HSCs from ASMase-knock-out mice exhibit increased basal level and activity of CtsB as well as its in vitro processing in culture, paralleling the enhanced expression of fibrogenic markers α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), TGF-β, and pro-collagen-α1(I) (Col1A1). Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of CtsB blunted the expression of α-SMA and Col1A1 and proliferation of HSCs from ASMase-knock-out mice. Consistent with the enhanced activation of CtsB in HSCs from ASMase-null mice, the in vivo liver fibrosis induced by chronic treatment with CCl4 increased in ASMase-null compared with wild-type mice, an effect that was reduced upon CtsB inhibition. In addition to liver, the enhanced proteolytic processing of CtsB was also observed in brain and lung of ASMase-knock-out mice, suggesting that the overexpression of CtsB may underlie the phenotype of NPD. Thus, these findings reveal a functional relationship between ASMase and CtsB and that the ablation of ASMase leads to the enhanced processing and activation of CtsB. Therefore, targeting CtsB may be of relevance in the treatment of liver fibrosis in patients with NPD.

ASMase works optimally at acidic pH and is located mainly in the endo/lysosomal compartments (1Jenkins R.W. Canals D. Hannun Y.A. Roles and regulation of secretory and lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase.Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 836-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Besides its important participation as key structural component of biological membranes, ceramide is recognized as a critical second messenger that regulates many cell functions (2Morales A. Lee H.

In particular, ceramide generation by ASMase is rapid and transient and plays a proapoptotic role in response to many different stimuli (2Morales A. Lee H. Goñi F.M. Kolesnick R. Fernandez-Checa J.C.

NPD type A and B, the most common subtypes of this disease, share features such as the accumulation of sphingomyelin, cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and bis-(monoacylglycerol) phosphate in the visceral organs such as liver, spleen, and lung. The subsequent formation of foam cells is the main cause of hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary insufficiency, and cardiovascular disease (6Schuchman E.H.

NPD type A patients typically exhibit almost a total loss of ASMase activity and suffer neurological degeneration that reduces their lifespan to about 3 years of age. NPD type B patients, however, frequently survive into adulthood and exhibit a milder phenotype with little or no neurodegeneration depending on the remaining percentage of ASMase activity (7Schuchman E.H. The pathogenesis and treatment of acid sphingomyelinase-deficient Niemann-Pick disease.Int. J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2009; 47: S48-S57PubMed Google Scholar).

Moreover, recent studies have revealed that ASMase controls the proteolytic processing of CtsB/D, and hence ASMase down-regulation impairs CtsB/D processing resulting in decreased hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation in vitro and lower in vivo fibrogenesis (17Moles A.

However, because many cathepsins are proteolytically processed by other members of the family and due to the hierarchical relationship between ASMase and CtsB/D (17Moles A. Tarrats N. Morales A.

To test this hypothesis we addressed the regulation of CtsB/D in ASMase-knock-out mice and examined the activation of HSCs in vitro and liver fibrosis in vivo as a potential contributory mechanism for enhanced liver disease observed in many NPD patients (18Labrune P.

Moreover, because the NPD phenotype is not restricted to liver, we addressed the regulation of CtsB/D in other commonly affected organs of ASMase-knock-out mice. Our findings revealed an increased proteolytic processing of CtsB/D in HSC from ASMase-null mice and that the pharmacological inhibition of CtsB prevents in vitro HSC activation and proliferation. Consequently, ASMase-knock-out mice exhibit increased in vivo liver fibrosis induced by CCl4 challenge, which is reduced upon CtsB inhibition. Similar findings regarding enhanced basal levels and increased processing of CtSB/D were observed in brain and lung from ASMase-knock-out mice.

Cathepsins B and D drive hepatic stellate cell proliferation and promote their fibrogenic potential.Hepatology. 2009; 49: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Culture purity, assessed routinely by retinoid autofluorescence at 350 nm, was >95%. Lack of staining for F4/80 confirmed the absence of Kupffer cells. Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Wild-type or ASMase KO mice were treated with CCl4 at a dose of 5 μl (10% CCl4 in corn oil)/g of body weight, by intraperitoneal injection twice a week for 4 weeks. Control animals received corn oil alone. Ca074Me (Sigma-Aldrich) was administered 30 min before CCl4, for the last 3 week of the study. Ca074Me was given intraperitoneally in a dosage according to CtsB expression in liver (0.25–1.0 mg/mouse). ASMase activity from cellular extracts was determined using a fluorescent sphingomyelin analog (NBD C6-sphingomyelin). Samples were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in incubation buffer containing 10 μmol/liter NBD C6-sphingomyelin (250 mmol/liter sodium acetate, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 5.0). Lipids were extracted, dried under N2, and separated by TLC (chloroform:ethanol: 20% NH4OH; 70:30:5, v/v). NBD-ceramide was visualized under UV light, and images were acquired and analyzed using a Gel Doc XR System with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Furthermore, ASMase activity in tissue lysates was performed as described (17Moles A. Tarrats N. Morales A. Domínguez M. Bataller R. Caballería J. García-Ruiz C. Fernández-Checa J.C. Marí M.

Pathol. 2010; 177: 1214-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). CtsB activity was assayed fluorometrically with Z-Arg-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin hydrochloride (60 μmol/liter) at pH 7.4 and 37 °C as described previously (10Moles A. Tarrats N. Fernández-Checa J.C. Marí M. Cathepsins B and D drive hepatic stellate cell proliferation and promote their fibrogenic potential.Hepatology. 2009; 49: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). CtsD was assayed using a Cathepsin D Activity Assay kit (catalog ab65302; Abcam) following the manufacturer's instructions. Results were expressed as cathepsin activity (slope of fluorescence emission after 40 min) per milligram of protein. Cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100 plus proteinase inhibitors). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay, and samples containing 10–30 μg were separated by 8–10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After membranes were blocked in 8% nonfat milk or 5% BSA in 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with different primary antibodies and developed with the ECL-peroxidase system. Proliferation was estimated as the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated into TCA-precipitable material as described previously (17Moles A. Tarrats N. Morales A. Domínguez M. Bataller R. Caballería J. García-Ruiz C. Fernández-Checa J.C. Marí M. Acidic sphingomyelinase controls hepatic stellate cell activation and in vivo liver fibrogenesis.Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 177: 1214-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Hepatic hydroxyproline content was determined by the method of Jamall et al. (23Jamall I.S. Finelli V.N. Que Hee S.S. A simple method to determine nanogram levels of 4-hydroxyproline in biological tissues.Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), as described previously (10Moles A. Tarrats N. Fernández-Checa J.C. Marí M. Cathepsins B and D drive hepatic stellate cell proliferation and promote their fibrogenic potential.Hepatology. 2009; 49: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Data were normalized to wet liver weight. Total RNA was isolated from HSCs with TRIzol reagent. Real-time RT-PCR was performed with an iScript™ One-Step reverse transcription-PCR kit with SYBR® Green following the manufacturer's instructions. The primers sequences used were: mouse α-SMA forward, 5′-ACTACTGCCGAGCGTGAGAT-3′ and reverse, 5′-AAGGTAGACAGCGAAGCCAA-3′ (GenBank accession number NM_007392); mouse TGF-β forward, 5′-GTCAGACATTCGGGAAGCAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-GCGTATCAGTGGGGGTCA-3′ (GenBank accession number NM_011577); mouse Col1A1 forward, 5′-ACTTCACTTCCTGCCTCAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGACTCAGGCTCTTGAGGGT-3′ (GenBank accession number NM_007742); mouse β-actin forward, 5′-GACGGCCAGGTCATCACTAT-3′ and reverse, 5′-CGGATGTCAACGTCACACTT-3′ (GenBank accession number NM_007393). Paraffin molds containing liver sections were cut into 5-μm sections and mounted on HistoGrip-coated slides. The sections were deparaffinized in xylene and dehydrated in graded alcohol series. Endogenous peroxidase (3% H2O2) and avidin and biotin were blocked. Slides were incubated with primary antibody overnight in a wet chamber at 4 °C. After rinsing with PBS 1×, the slides were incubated with a biotinylated antibody for 45 min in a wet chamber and developed with the ABC kit with peroxidase substrate (DAB) and peroxidase buffer. After rinsing the slides with tap water they were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with Aquatex. Livers were fixed, included in paraffin, and sections of 7 μm were routinely stained with H&E, periodic acid-Schiff, Nissl staining, or with a 0.1% Sirius Red-picric solution following standard procedures. All images display representative data from at least three independent observations. The experiments were repeated at least three times. The statistical significance of differences was performed using the unpaired, nonparametric Student's t test. Given the functional relationship between ASMase and cathepsins recently reported in liver fibrosis (17Moles A. Tarrats N. Morales A. Domínguez M. Bataller R. Caballería J. García-Ruiz C. Fernández-Checa J.C. Marí M. Acidic sphingomyelinase controls hepatic stellate cell activation and in vivo liver fibrogenesis.Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 177: 1214-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we analyzed the expression of CtsB and CtsD in HSCs from ASMase−/− mice. HSCs were isolated and cultured in plastic to follow their activation process in vitro from quiescent HSCs to myofibroblasts like cells responsible for the fiber deposition. As shown in Fig. 1A we observed an up-regulation of CtsB and CtsD expression and processing compared with wild-type HSCs. In particular, CtsB expression was remarkably induced, as shown by the enhanced activity of CtsB in ASMase−/− HSCs compared with wild-type HSCs (Fig. 1B). Kinetic analyses revealed enhanced expression of CtsB/D at the early phase in the activation of HSC (Fig. 1, A and B). Genetic deficiency of ASMase also resulted in elevated expression of the activation markers α-SMA and Col1A1 at the protein (Fig. 1A) and mRNA level (Fig. 1, C and D), which was further accompanied by overexpression of other markers of HSC activation such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) (Fig. 1E). Considering the difference in -fold increase of mRNA levels for α-SMA and Col1A1, the corresponding increase at the protein level at day 8 of culture was more apparent for Col1A1 than for α-SMA. In parallel with these observations, the proliferation rate of HSC from day 2 after isolation to day 8 of culture was significantly increased in ASMase−/− HSCs compared with wild-type HSCs (Fig. 1F). Thus, HSCs from ASMase−/− mice exhibit increased fibrogenic potential, which correlated with enhanced CtsB/D levels and processing. According to our observations in the knock-out mice, complete absence of ASMase up-regulates CtsB and CtsD. Because in previous studies we have already disclosed the importance of CtsB in liver fibrosis and that the use of a selective CtsB inhibitor (Ca074Me) reduced HSC activation in an experimental liver fibrosis model (10Moles A. Tarrats N. Fernández-Checa J.C. Marí M. Cathepsins B and D drive hepatic stellate cell proliferation and promote their fibrogenic potential.Hepatology. 2009; 49: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we decided to test whether the up-regulation of CtsB observed in ASMase−/− HSCs plays a causal role in their enhanced fibrogenic potential, evaluating the effect of inhibiting CtsB using the specific inhibitor Ca074Me. In analyzing the expression of α-SMA and Col1A1 in 7-day-old HSC cultures, we observed an increased expression of these markers of HSC transdifferentiation that was prevented after Ca074Me treatment, both in wild-type and ASMase−/− HSCs (Fig. 2A). Moreover, proliferation was also significantly diminished under these conditions, even in ASMase−/− HSCs (Fig. 2B). As previously observed in wild-type HSCs (10Moles A. Tarrats N. Fernández-Checa J.C. Marí M. Cathepsins B and D drive hepatic stellate cell proliferation and promote their fibrogenic potential.Hepatology. 2009; 49: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), AKT phosphorylation induced by PDGF was enhanced in HSC from ASMase-knock-out mice and blocked by Ca074Me (data not shown). Ca074Me did not cause any noticeable cell death or toxicity at the doses and time utilized. Hence, these results suggest that CtsB is responsible for the enhanced fibrogenic features observed in ASMase-knock-out HSCs. Our previous studies indicated that heterozygous ASMase mice are less sensitive to in vivo liver fibrosis due to impaired CtsB activation. However, the preceding findings indicate that the complete loss of ASMase leads to increased CtsB expression, which is known to contribute to liver fibrosis and is a marker of disease progression in NASH patients (17Moles A. Tarrats N. Morales A. Domínguez M. Bataller R. Caballería J. García-Ruiz C. Fernández-Checa J.C. Marí M. Acidic sphingomyelinase controls hepatic stellate cell activation and in vivo liver fibrogenesis.Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 177: 1214-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, to analyze whether CtsB overexpression sensitizes to liver fibrosis we decided to administer CCl4 to ASMase−/− and wild-type mice. We chose CCl4 instead of bile duct ligation because the degree of liver damage is independent of ASMase (17Moles A. Tarrats N. Morales A. Domínguez M. Bataller R. Caballería J. García-Ruiz C. Fernández-Checa J.C. Marí M. Acidic sphingomyelinase controls hepatic stellate cell activation and in vivo liver fibrogenesis.Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 177: 1214-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). CCl4 challenge for 4 weeks increased serum alanine transaminase levels in wild-type and ASMase deficient mice to a similar extent (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, basal levels of CtsB activity were increased in ASMase−/− livers and were further enhanced upon induction of liver fibrosis with CCl4 only in ASMase-deficient livers. In addition, enhanced levels of CtsD were also detected in ASMase-deficient livers that were further increased after CCl4 challenge (Fig. 3C). Moreover, in CCl4-treated animals enhanced levels of CtsB and CtsD correlated with an elevated α-SMA expression, as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3C) and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3E), indicating that ASMase-deficient animals have increased number of activated HSCs. Analysis of the hydroxyproline content in the liver revealed a significant increase in collagen accumulation in ASMase-deficient animals compared with wild-type animals after CCl4 administration (Fig. 3D), which correlated with the increased detection of collagen fibers in the livers of ASMase−/− mice that received CCl4, as detected by Sirius Red staining (Fig. 4A). The Sirius Red staining, as well as the α-SMA expression, observed in the ASMase−/− livers did not follow the typical pattern along the collagen fibers but displayed a characteristic arrangement surrounding foam cells, lipid-accumulating macrophages also known as Niemann-Pick cells. This atypical distribution was observed only in ASMase-deficient livers that received CCl4; this particular cell type, however, was not observed in ASMase−/− animals receiving only vehicle (Fig. 4A). On histological examination we observed mild sinusoidal dilatation, by H&E staining (Fig. 4B), and moderate neutrophilic infiltration, as detected by myeloperoxidase immunostaining (Fig. 4C) in wild-type livers upon CCl4 challenge. These parameters were exacerbated in ASMase−/− animals that presented noticeable infiltration of neutrophils especially adjacent to foam cells, clearly visible by H&E staining. Collectively, these results indicate that liver fibrosis is significantly increased in ASMase-KO mice.FIGURE 4Fiber deposition, presence of foam cells, and inflammation were decreased in ASMase−/− livers after CtsB inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W2092537891,"Background Despite significant protection in preclinical studies, cellulose sulfate (CS) failed to protect women against HIV-1/2 and was associated with a trend toward increased HIV-1 acquisition in one of the clinical trials. These results highlight the need for preclinical tests more predictive of clinical outcomes. The objective of this study was to test coded vaginal gels, including CS, in murine models of safety and efficacy to determine the models' utility for evaluating future products. Methods Four coded formulations, including 6% CS, 2% PRO 2000 and two placebo gels, were administered intravaginally to medroxyprogesterone-treated mice and their ability to prevent genital herpes (efficacy) or to alter the susceptibility to low dose HSV challenge (safety) was determined. Nonoyxnol-9 served as a positive toxicity control. Results CS and PRO 2000 significantly protected mice from genital herpes following infection with a laboratory or clinical isolate of HSV-2 introduced in buffer (p<0.001). However, protection was reduced when virus was introduced in seminal plasma. Moreover, mice were significantly more susceptible to infection with low doses of HSV-2 when challenged 12 h after the 7th daily dose of CS or nonoxynol-9 (p<0.05). The increased susceptibility was associated with alterations in epithelial architecture. Conclusions CS prevented genital herpes when present at the time of viral challenge, but increased the rate of infection when gel was applied daily for 7 days with a vaginal wash prior to viral inoculation. The findings presumably reflect altered epithelial architecture, which may have contributed to the trend towards increased HIV observed clinically."

Neither of the two MED1 LXXLL motifs is required for AR binding, whereas loss of the intramolecular AR N/C interaction decreases MED1 binding. We further demonstrate that mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation of MED1 enhances the AR-MED1 interaction in prostate cancer cells.

The physiological actions of these androgenic hormones are mediated primarily through the androgen receptor (AR), a 110-kDa member of the nuclear receptor (NR) family of ligand-activated transcription factors (1Claessens F.

Similar to other members of the NR family, the AR has a modular structure, including a large, poorly conserved N-terminal domain (NTD), a highly conserved DNA binding domain, a C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD), and a hinge region connecting the DNA binding domain with the LBD. For most NRs, the predominant transcriptional activation domain (termed activation function 2 or AF2) resides in the LBD and facilitates ligand-dependent transcriptional activation (3Glass C.K.

Yet for the AR, the major transcriptional activation domain resides almost entirely in the NTD and can be subdivided into two distinct regions: transactivation unit-1 (Tau-1) (residues 100–360) and transactivation unit-5 (Tau-5) (residues 360–528) (1Claessens F.

While AR also contains a C-terminal AF2 domain capable of binding LXXLL-bearing polypeptides in the presence of ligand (9Zhou X.E. Suino-Powell K.M. Li J. He Y. Mackeigan J.P. Melcher K. Yong E.L. Xu H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9161-9171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the AR-AF2 domain differs from that of other NRs in that it more strongly binds to signature FXXLF motifs such as the 23FQNLF27 motif found at the AR-NTD (10Dubbink H.J. Hersmus R. Verma C.S. van der Korput H.A. Berrevoets C.A. van Tol J. Ziel-van der Made A.C. Brinkmann A.O. Pike A.C. Trapman J. Mol.

PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E274Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The resulting intramolecular N/C interaction is thought to generate alternative coactivator binding sites at the AR NTD and hinge region (1Claessens F. Denayer S. Van Tilborgh N. Kerkhofs S. Helsen C. Haelens A. Nucl. Recept Signal. 2008; 6: e008Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 2Dehm S.M. Tindall D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 2855-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). For example, members of the p160/SRC family of coactivators directly bind to the Tau-5 domain of the AR NTD via conserved Gln-rich regions in a manner that is independent of their intrinsic LXXLL motifs (14Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 15Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell.

Coactivator complexes shown to interact with the AR hinge region include the BAF57-containing SWI/SNF complex and the p300/PCAF complex (17García-Pedrero J.M. Kiskinis E. Parker M.G. Belandia B. J.

Haelens A. Claessens F. Revelo M.P. Knudsen K.E. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4551-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutational analyses of the AR NTD have also implicated the Tau-1 domain as a potential coactivator binding surface (19Callewaert L. Van Tilborgh N. Claessens F. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), yet the identity of the corresponding interacting coregulatory factors remain unclear. Mediator is an evolutionarily conserved multisubunit complex that plays an essential coregulatory role in eukaryotic transcription of protein-encoding genes (reviewed in Ref. 20Kornberg R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 235-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The complex can facilitate multiple functions in transcription, including recruitment of RNA polymerase II, activation of the pre-initiation complex, regulation of distinct chromatin modification events, and promotion of transcriptional elongation (21Malik S. Roeder R.G. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Mediator is composed of over 30 subunits, several of which interact with different signal-activated gene-specific transcription factors (22Knuesel M.T. Taatjes D.J. Transcription. 2011; 2: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In human cells, Mediator was initially isolated as a coactivator activity bound to NRs in the presence of ligand (23Belakavadi M. Fondell J.D. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 156: 23-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A single subunit of Mediator, termed MED1 (also known as TRAP220, PBP, and DRIP205), can directly target the complex to the AF2 domain of DNA-bound NRs via two signature LXXLL motifs (24Ren Y. Behre E. Ren Z. Zhang J. Wang Q. Fondell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5433-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Despite its functional importance as the binding target for most NRs, MED1 is only variably associated with Mediator existing in a small subpopulation (∼20%) of steady-state Mediator complexes (25Taatjes D.J. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 675-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Zhang X. Krutchinsky A. Fukuda A. Chen W. Yamamura S. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Notably in this regard, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) regulates MED1 activity via phosphorylation by promoting its association with Mediator and enhancing its NR-dependent transcriptional coactivator activity (27Belakavadi M. Pandey P.K. Vijayvargia R. Fondell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Pandey P.K. Udayakumar T.S. Lin X. Sharma D. Shapiro P.S. Fondell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10695-10710Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The MED1-Mediator complex plays a key coregulatory role for AR-dependent transcription in prostate cells (29Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A. Nelson C.A. Welsbie D. Chen C. Sawyers C.L. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3100-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Jin F. Fondell J.D.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2146-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Moreover, MED1 expression is enriched in the prostate epithelium (34Vijayvargia R. May M.S. Fondell J.D. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4034-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), a tissue whose growth and development are dependent on androgen signaling (2Dehm S.M. Tindall D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 2855-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In a comparative study of the requirement of different AR coactivators, MED1 was found to be indispensible for androgen-dependent, prostate-specific transcription of the well characterized AR target gene prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (31Wang Q. Carroll J.S. Brown M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Loss of MED1 expression in prostate cancer cells was accompanied by a significant reduction in RNA polymerase II and basal transcription factor recruitment at the PSA gene promoter (31Wang Q. Carroll J.S. Brown M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). More recent studies utilizing androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells have revealed that MED1 is required for robust transcription of other AR target genes and further suggest that amplification or hyper-activation of MED1 promotes prostate oncogenesis (34Vijayvargia R. May M.S. Fondell J.D. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4034-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35Chen Z. Zhang C. Wu D. Chen H. Rorick A. Zhang X. Wang Q.

Cell. 2009; 138: 245-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Although these studies clearly implicate functional interactions between AR and MED1, their respective binding domains have surprisingly remained poorly defined. Previous reports suggested that the two signature MED1 LXXLL motifs facilitate a very weak interaction with an isolated GST-AR AF2 fusion (9Zhou X.E. Suino-Powell K.M. Li J. He Y. Mackeigan J.P. Melcher K. Yong E.L. Xu H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9161-9171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32Wang Q. Sharma D. Ren Y. Fondell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42852-42858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), yet the physiological relevance of these data is unclear in light of the much stronger N/C interaction that takes place between the AR N-terminal 23FQNLF27 motif and its core AF2 domain. In an effort to better understand how MED1 coactivates AR activity, we utilized a broad array of deletion and point mutants to investigate how the two proteins bind to one another in the presence of ligand. We report here that MED1 binds to the AR N-terminal Tau-1 domain via two tandem α-helices located between MED1 residues 505 and 537. Surprisingly, neither of MED1's two LXXLL motifs is required for this association, whereas loss of the AR N/C interaction inhibits AR binding with MED1. Our results also reveal that ERK1/2 phosphorylation of MED1 promotes its binding to AR in prostate cancer cells by directly stabilizing the AR-MED1 interaction and by stabilizing MED1 cellular expression, which in turn drives its interaction with AR. Together our data reveal a novel AR-MED1 binding mechanism that may have clinical implications for AR-mediated gene expression in prostate cancer.

The PCR fragments were then ligated into pGEX-2TK (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). pSG5-HA-MED1Δα1,α2 was created via PCR-generated mutagenesis by deletion of amino acid residues from 501 to 541 from the parental pSG5-HA-MED1wt template. pSG5-HA-MED1-LXXAA(A/B) was generated by using the parental pSG5-HA-MED1-LXXAA(A) template together with a specific mutant oligonucleotide (LL residues 648 and 649 to AA). pGEX-2TK-RBD1-Δα1 and pGEX-2TK-RBD1-Δα2 were generated by using mutagenic oligonucleotides deleting residues 506–517 for Δα1 and residues 523–533 for Δα2, respectively. LNCaP, DU145, 1532T, and COS cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. LNCaP and 1532T cells were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gemini Bioproducts) along with penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). COS and DU145 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. In the androgen starvation experiments, cells were grown in phenol red-free medium containing 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS (CDS-FBS, Gemini Bioproducts). All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. DHT and R1881 were from Sigma. EGF was from Invitrogen. U0126 was from Alexis Biochemicals. Smart pool small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for MED1 was from Dharmacon Research as previously described (28Pandey P.K. Udayakumar T.S. Lin X. Sharma D. Shapiro P.S. Fondell J.D. Mol. Cell.

LNCaP cells were grown to 60% confluency in 10% CDS-FBS containing RPMI 1640 and transfected with MED1-specific or control siRNA at the final concentration of 100 nm using the Lipofectamine and Plus reagents (Invitrogen). Three hours post-transfection, medium was replaced with fresh medium containing or lacking DHT (10 nm final) for an additional 48 h. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 1 h at 4 °C. One milligram of protein from each sample was combined with 1 μg of anti-AR antibodies and 10 μl (packed) of protein A-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times in lysis buffer, and the precipitated immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was then processed for Western blotting analyses. LNCaP cells were cultured in CDS-FBS containing media for 3 days and then seeded (1 × 105 cells) in 12-well plates and cotransfected with 100 ng of MMTV-Luc and pSG5-HA-MED1 (0.5 μg) or pSG5-HA-MED1Δα1,α2 (0.5 μg) using Lipofectamine and Plus reagents (Invitrogen). For competition assays, pSG5-HA-MED1Δ454 (50 ng), pSG5-HA-MED1Δ918 (0.2 μg), or pSG5-empty vector were cotransfected with 100 ng of MMTV-Luc and 0.5 μg of pSG5-HA-MED1. Three hours post-transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh media containing or lacking R1881 (10 nm final) for an additional 24 h. Cells were harvested, and equivalent amounts of protein were assayed for luciferase activity using an assay kit (Promega) and a luminometer. Luciferase values were normalized by using a β-galactosidase (pSV-β-gal, Promega) expression vector as internal control. Generation of recombinant baculovirus and purification of recombinant proteins from infected Sf9 cells were carried out as previously described (27Belakavadi M. Pandey P.K. Vijayvargia R.

A double-stranded biotinylated androgen response element (ARE) corresponding to the androgen-responsive unit in the first intron of the C3(1) gene (40Celis L. Claessens F. Peeters B. Heyns W.

After 90 min, 10–50 ng of bv-MED1 or bv-MED1 mutants was added to the binding reactions, and the mixture was incubated for another 2 h at 4 °C. Each sample was washed 5× with binding buffer, resolved on an 8% SDS-PAGE, and then detected by immunoblotting using antibodies against HA, MED1, and AR. Transient transfections were carried out in 6-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). COS-7 cells were first cultured in 10% CDS-FBS medium for 48 h to starve cells of androgen. For AR deletion mutant analyses, 5 × 105 COS cells were transfected with pSG5-FLAG-ARΔNTD (1.25 μg), pSG5-FLAG-ARΔTau5 (1 μg), pSG5-FLAG-ARΔTau1 (1.25 μg), pSG5-FLAG-ARΔcTau1 (1.5 μg), pSG5-FLAG-AR (2 μg), pSG5-FLAG-AR-ΔF (2 μg), or pSG5-FLAG-AR-G21E (2 μg) along with 2 μg of pSG5-HA-MED1. For the analyses of MED1 mutants, pSG5-HA-MED1 (2 μg), pSG5-HA-MED1Δ454 (0.25 μg), pSG5-HA-MED1Δ690 (0.5 μg), pSG5-HA-MED1Δ918 (1 μg), pSG5-HA-MED1Δ1215 (1.5 μg), pSG5-HA-MED1Δ1233 (0.25 μg), pSG5-HA-MED1-LXXAA(A) (2 μg), pSG5-HA-MED1-LXXAA(B) (2 μg), pSG5-HA-MED1-LXXAA(A/B) (2 μg), pSG5-HA-MED1-ERKmut (2 μg), or pSG5-HA-MED1Δα1,α2 (2 μg) were transfected, along with pSG5-FLAG-AR (2 μg). Three hours post-transfection, cells were then treated with or without 10 nm R1881 for another 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein lysate were then incubated with 5 μl of packed anti-HA-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight and then washed three times with lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated protein was fractioned by 6% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting as indicated in the text. For MED1 phosphorylation studies, 1 μg of pCMV-ERK2-L73P/S151D, pMCL-HA-MKK1–8E, or pMCL-HA-MKK1-NΔ4 was transfected as indicated in the text. Cell lysate was prepared 24 h post-transfection in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Equal amounts of protein lysate were resolved on a 6% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-MED1 antibody. LNCaP cells were cultured for 3 days in CDS-FBS-containing medium and then treated with or without DHT (10 nm) for 4 h and with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) or U0126 (50 μm) for 30 min. Antibodies specific for AR and Mediator subunits were used to immunoprecipitate formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin-protein complexes as outlined in detail previously (30Jin F. Fondell J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed via semi-quantitative PCR using primers spanning the enhancer region of the PSA gene or promoter region of Cdc6 gene as described previously (30Jin F. Fondell J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Wang Q. Sharma D. Ren Y. Fondell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42852-42858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). All ChIP experiments were carried out at least three times. Image processing and quantitation of the semi-quantitative PCR data were performed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). LNCaP cells were androgen-starved in phenol red-free RPMI 1640/10% CDS-FBS for 2 days and then treated with or without DHT (10 nm) for 4 h and with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) or U0126 (50 μm) for additional 30 min. Total RNA was then isolated using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was generated using 1 μg of total RNA via MuMLV-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 20 μl.

MMP-13 expression is strongly up-regulated in arthritis, largely because of stimulation by inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β. Treatment of chondrocytes with IL-1β induces transcription of MMP-13 in vitro. IL-1β signaling converges upon the activator protein-1 transcription factors, which have been shown to be required for IL-1β-induced MMP-13 gene expression. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we detected activator protein-1 binding within an evolutionarily conserved DNA sequence ∼20 kb 5′ relative to the MMP-13 transcription start site (TSS). Also using ChIP, we detected histone modifications and binding of RNA polymerase II within this conserved region, all of which are consistent with transcriptional activation. Chromosome conformation capture indicates that chromosome looping brings this region in close proximity with the MMP-13 TSS. Finally, a luciferase reporter construct driven by a component of the conserved region demonstrated an expression pattern similar to that of endogenous MMP-13. These data suggest that a conserved region at 20 kb upstream from the MMP-13 TSS includes a distal transcriptional response element of MMP-13, which contributes to MMP-13 gene expression.

Of particular importance in arthritis is MMP-13, a member of the collagenase subgroup of MMPs. The degradation of type II collagen, the major type of collagen in cartilage, is considered a key step in the irreversible destruction of joint tissues. Although another collagenase, MMP-1, also degrades type II collagen, MMP-13 is the more efficient of the two (3Mitchell P.G. Magna H.A. Reeves L.M. Lopresti-Morrow L.L. Yocum S.A. Rosner P.J.

However, the transcriptional induction of MMP-13 in rheumatoid arthritis is mediated by inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, which induces the expression of MMP-13 largely via the activator protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-κB family of transcription factors (4Mengshol J.A.

A puzzling aspect of these studies, however, is that reporter constructs driven by the MMP-13 proximal promoter often do not mimic the expression pattern of endogenous MMP-13 (5Mengshol J.A.

We speculate that perhaps this is due to the lack of other sequence elements outside of the proximal promoter, which are required for tissue-specific regulation of MMP-13 expression in chondrocytes in response to IL-1β. In this study, our goal was to identify novel AP-1 response elements more distal to the proximal promoter. These response elements may be necessary for appropriate regulation of MMP-13, and this may be reflected in the ability of these elements to confer an endogenous expression pattern to MMP-13 promoter-driven reporter constructs. Using ChIP, we identified Fos and Jun binding at an evolutionarily conserved region ∼20 kb upstream from the MMP-13 transcription start site (TSS). This region also bears histone modifications consistent with those of a transcription response element. Furthermore, chromosome conformation capture (3C) data demonstrated that chromosome looping places this distal region in close proximity to the TSS. In addition, a reporter assay established this region as a response element of MMP-13 expression, and notably, expression of the response element-driven reporter construct mimicked expression of endogenous MMP-13. Thus, our data identify a novel mechanism by which IL-1β induces MMP-13 gene expression. SW-1353 human chondrosarcoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM (HyClone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 5% FBS (HyClone), and 2 mm glutamine. The cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and passaged 1:10 using 0.25% trypsin (Mediatech). Recombinant human IL-1β (Promega, Madison WI) was solubilized in sterile H2O, stored in 10 μg/ml aliquots at −80 °C, and added to media at a final concentration of 1 ng/ml. For experiments, SW-1353 cells were grown to ∼90% confluence in 15-cm plates or 6-well plates and washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Two-ml (6-well plates) or 25-ml (15-cm plates) of serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.2% lactalbumin hydrolysate, with or without IL-β was added for varying periods of time. SW-1353 cells were grown to 90% confluence in 150-mm plates (∼107 cells). Cross-linking was performed by adding 40 μl of 37% formaldehyde/ml of cell culture medium directly to the culture medium, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1× PBS with HALT protease inhibitors (Fisher), scraped, and collected in 15-ml conical tubes on ice. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 1 ml of ChIP buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors, and lysed on ice for 10 min. Chromatin was sonicated on ice with fifteen 15-s pulses at power setting 40 on a Sonics Vibra-Cell VC 130PB-1 ultrasonic processor. The debris was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was split into 200-μl aliquots in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes for immunoprecipitation. Two μg of specific antibodies to AcH4, H3K4me2 (antibodies 06-866 and 07-030; Millipore, Temecula, CA), pan-Fos, or pan-Jun (antibodies sc-253 and sc-44; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or RNA Pol II (antibody ab5408; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) were added to each tube, and the tubes were rotated overnight at 4 °C. A 1:1 mix of protein A and protein G Dynabeads (10001D and 10003D; Invitrogen) per immunoprecipitation was washed three times and then resuspended 1:1 with ChIP buffer and distributed (40 μl/immunoprecipitation) to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Immunoprecipitation reactions were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and then 180 μl of supernatant was transferred to the protein A/G tubes and rotated for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were collected by a magnetic rack and then washed five times by removing supernatant and resuspending in ice-cold ChIP buffer. After washing, the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 10% Chelex-100 (Fisher), boiled for 10 min, and then cooled on ice. One μl of proteinase K (20 μg/μl) was added to the cooled solution, vortexed, incubated at 55 °C for 30 min, then boiled for 10 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min. Eighty μl of supernatant were transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube; 120 μl of water was added back to the original tube, vortexed, and centrifuged as before; and 120 μl of supernatant was transferred to the previous 80 μl. The samples were stored at −20 °C or immediately quantified using real time PCR with primers as indicated in Fig. 1 and Table 1, and immunoprecipitated DNA amounts were normalized to inputs and are expressed as the relative enrichment.TABLE 1PrimersForward primer (5′ → 3′)Reverse primer (5′ → 3′)ChIP Primers ChIP1GGGCTGTGAAGCAGCTGAGTATTTTGGCCAGGATGATGTTACAGTGGT ChIP2AGGGCATGACTCACAAACTCTCCTGTCATGTTCTCTGGCTTCAACCCT ChIP3GTGCCCTGTGCAGTTCAAAGACATAAGAAATGGGTCCCAGAAACCGCT ChIP4CCCAAAGTCGGGCAAATGTGGAATTTGATTCAGCAAGCCATCAGGCAG ChIP5CCTGTTCCTTTGTGCTGTGCTCATTGAAGGAGAAGAAAGGTCCAGCCA ChIP6ATACGACACCCGAAGCAAGTCACATTGAGGGCAGCATCTCAGTCTTCA TSSGTCGCCACGTAAGCATGTTTACCTCTGTTGTCTTTCCGCAGAGATTACC ChIP7AGAGCATGGCGACTTCTACCCATTTCTCCTCCATAATTTGGCCCAGGA ChIP8AGGTTGGTGGTGAAAGTGAGATCCTACCACAGGCCACTTGAGAGGTTT ChIP9AGGCCATGAGACCATGGAAGACATGCAAATGTGCCAGGCATTGTGTTG3C PrimersPrimer (5′ → 3′) AnchorCCTGATATGACTCATTCTGAAGTCGAAAAGGC 1GACTTCAGACCATATTTCAAGGAAGGATGGG 2GGCAGATGAGGTAGAAATCAGTGAACTGG 3GGGCTGTGAAGCAGCTGAGTATTT 4GGAAGTGAGACCACAGCAGTCTAGATTTAC Open table in a new tab We used 3C to test for looping interactions between the transcription start site and distal upstream regions. The cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, using the same procedures described in our ChIP methods (above). Digestion and ligation were performed using established procedures (12Dekker J.

Briefly, the cells were cross-linked, and then the cross-linking reaction was quenched with glycine, and cells were harvested by scraping. We then homogenized cell pellets in a Dounce homogenizer B with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). The cell pellet was aliquoted into twenty 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, ∼5 × 106 cells each. The cell pellets were digested in restriction enzyme buffer specific to BspHI, and the cells were incubated in 0.3% SDS. We chose BspHI because it resulted in a suitable digestion pattern at the proximal promoter and distal regions. The cells were digested with 400 units BspHI/5 × 106 cells for 36 h at 37 °C. The digested samples were then ligated with 4000 units of T4 DNA ligase for 2 h at 16 °C. The samples were then incubated overnight in proteinase K to reverse cross-links, and DNA was purified by two rounds of phenol chloroform extraction and then five rounds of ethanol precipitation. The DNA pellet was dissolved in Tris-EDTA and quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. To control for PCR and primer efficiencies, PCR products were first made for all primer pairs spanning the region of interest (data not shown). Primers were chosen within the region from the TSS to −25 kb relative to the TSS, and the primers were designed such that the annealing temperatures were uniformly 58 ± 1 °C. Final PCR products were analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis. Luciferase reporter plasmids incorporating 1.6 kb of the MMP-13 proximal promoter (5Mengshol J.A. Vincenti M.P. Brinckerhoff C.E. IL-1 induces collagenase-3 (MMP-13) promoter activity in stably transfected chondrocytic cells: requirement for Runx-2 and activation by p38 MAPK and JNK pathways.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4361-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) or 1.6 kb of the proximal promoter plus 1.5 kb flanking the ChIP-2 locus inserted immediately 5′ to the promoter were constructed using the pGL3-basic plasmid (Promega). Empty pGL3-basic vector was used as a control. SW-1353 cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well. The next day, the cells were transiently transfected in 6-well plates with 2 μg/well of each plasmid, using 5 μl/well of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per manufacturer's instructions. Four to six h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution followed by the addition of 2 ml of DMEM/lactalbumin hydrolysate medium, with or without IL-1β for 24 h. The cells were then washed three times with cold 1× PBS, and lysates were harvested using 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, and equal amounts of total protein were loaded for each sample. Luciferase activity was measured in relative light units using an Lmax II luminometer (Molecular Devices). All of the p values were calculated from triplicate samples for the difference from the IL-1β sample as indicated in the figures, using the Student's t test. Previous studies of MMP-13 transcriptional regulation have focused on a relatively narrow window of the MMP-13 promoter in the search for AP-1 binding sites (5Mengshol J.A. Vincenti M.P. Brinckerhoff C.E. IL-1 induces collagenase-3 (MMP-13) promoter activity in stably transfected chondrocytic cells: requirement for Runx-2 and activation by p38 MAPK and JNK pathways.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4361-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 15Tardif G. Pelletier J.P. Dupuis M. Hambor J.E. Martel-Pelletier J. Cloning, sequencing and characterization of the 5'-flanking region of the human collagenase-3 gene.Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study, we expanded the search window to potentially identify more distal binding sites. To avoid bias, the region under examination (the transcribed region plus 25 kb upstream) was divided arbitrarily into 1-kb segments, and primers were designed for every third segment. When primers failed or we were unable to find suitable primers for a segment, we designed primers in a neighboring segment. Thus, we designed nonoverlapping primers (Fig. 1 and Table 1) tiling 25 kb upstream from the transcription start site (TSS), as well as the transcribed region of MMP-13, to scan the region for possible AP-1-binding sites. We then conducted a time course experiment, using ChIP coupled with qPCR, with pan-Jun and pan-Fos antibodies to determine where and when AP-1 family members were binding to this 25-kb region. We added IL-1β to the cells in serum-free medium for 30 min, 4 h, or 24 h and included untreated cells as a negative control. Cells for all conditions were cross-linked and processed simultaneously, as described above and under “Experimental Procedures.” Both MMP-13 and another collagenase, MMP-1, are similarly induced by inflammatory stimuli via the AP-1 transcription factors and have a nearly identical expression profile in SW1353 cells stimulated with IL-1β (9Burrage P.S. Huntington J.T. Sporn M.B. Brinckerhoff C.E. Regulation of matrix metalloproteinase gene expression by a retinoid X receptor-specific ligand.Arthritis Rheum. 2007; 56: 892-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For this reason, we expected the binding kinetics of Fos and Jun to be similar to those described in a previous study of AP-1 binding to the MMP-1 promoter (16Martens J.H. Verlaan M. Kalkhoven E. Zantema A. Cascade of distinct histone modifications during collagenase gene activation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1808-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the untreated control, constitutive levels of both Fos and Jun binding are relatively low across the region (Fig. 2). Our data show that IL-1β treatment leads to a significant (p < 0.01) increase in Fos and Jun family members binding most prominently near the ChIP-1 primer pair. Binding was detected at 30 min and 4 h after treatment with IL-1β and returned to control levels by 24 h. There was also an increase in Fos binding at the ChIP-6 locus at 30 min and 4 h, and an increase in the Jun-binding region-wide at the 4-h time point. However, there was no definitive increase in Jun binding at ChIP-6, and because the two bind to form the AP-1 heterodimeric transcription factor, this suggests that binding of Fos at the ChIP-6 site may not be functional. Furthermore, detection of both Fos and Jun serves as an internal control for the experiment, and both are involved in the IL-1β induction of MMP-13 expression (17Tardif G. Reboul P. Pelletier J.P. Martel-Pelletier J. Ten years in the life of an enzyme: the story of the human MMP-13 (collagenase-3).Mod. Rheumatol. 2004; 14: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). DNA sequence alignment data from the University of California, Santa Cruz genome browser, shows that ChIP-1, -2, and -3 are within a region that contains conserved sequence among vertebrates (Fig. 3A) (18Blanchette M. Kent W.J. Riemer C. Elnitski L. Smit A.F. Roskin K.M. Baertsch R. Rosenbloom K. Clawson H. Green E.D. Haussler D. Miller W. Aligning multiple genomic sequences with the threaded blockset aligner.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 708-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar) and that this region contains several consensus AP-1 sites (Fig. 3B), suggesting a biologically relevant role (see below). The ChIP-6 locus does not appear to be conserved (data not shown). Although this does not rule out a potential role for this site in the regulation of MMP-13 gene expression, we chose to focus instead on the more distal region. The sequence conservation and the binding of AP-1 transcription factors determined by ChIP (Fig. 2) led us to consider the presence of a functional element near the ChIP-1 locus. Therefore, we sought to determine whether this region bore other hallmarks of a transcriptional response element, such as the presence of the histone modifications, acetylated histone H4 (AcH4) and dimethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me2), which are indicative of both actively transcribed regions and transcriptional response elements (19Heintzman N.D. Stuart R.K. Hon G. Fu Y. Ching C.W. Hawkins R.D. Barrera L.O. Van Calcar S. Qu C. Ching K.A. Wang W. Weng Z. Green R.D. Crawford G.E. Ren B. Distinct and predictive chromatin signatures of transcriptional promoters and enhancers in the human genome.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar). Using the same approach as in our previous AP-1 ChIP, we scanned the transcribed and upstream regions of MMP-13 for H3K4me2- and AcH4-enriched sites. The cells were left untreated or treated with IL-1β for 24 h and then analyzed by ChIP for enrichment of H3K4me2 and AcH4. The AcH4 modification was induced by IL-1β throughout the entire region, but a clear increase can be seen within the transcribed region (Fig. 4A, ChIP loci 7–9), as expected for an actively transcribed gene. Importantly, however, a significant (p < 0.01) increase in AcH4 levels was also detected at the ChIP-2 and ChIP-3 loci (Fig. 4A), in agreement with our hypothesis that this region contains an active IL1-β response element (see below). The transcribed region was also enriched for the H3K4me2 modification (Fig. 4B), consistent with the histone modification profile of a transcriptionally active gene. In addition, the levels of H3K4me2 were significantly (<0.01) elevated at ChIP-2, with or without stimulation with IL-1β, in agreement with previous observations associating an increase in H3K4me2 with transcriptional response elements (19Heintzman N.D. Stuart R.K. Hon G. Fu Y. Ching C.W. Hawkins R.D. Barrera L.O. Van Calcar S. Qu C. Ching K.A. Wang W. Weng Z. Green R.D. Crawford G.E. Ren B.

We confirmed and extended these findings by delineating AcH4 and H3K4me2 marks in a time course experiment (supplemental Fig. S1). The data agree with those presented in Fig. 4 and indicate that these regions are engaged early in the transcriptional activation of MMP-13, coincident with the recruitment of Fos and Jun binding. However, neither the AcH4 nor the H3K4me2 modifications were substantially enriched at ChIP-1. The lack of AcH4 and H3K4me2 at ChIP-1 does not rule out this locus as a component of the response element, because the resolution of these ChIP experiments is such that the precise AP-1 binding site(s) and boundaries of the AcH4/H3K4me2-enriched region cannot be determined. In agreement with our AcH4 and H3K4me2 ChIP results, data from the University of California, Santa Cruz genome browser and the ENCODE Project indicate the presence of Fos/Jun binding site(s) as determined by ChIP-seq within the ChIP-2 locus (Fig. 3B) (20NCODE Project Consortium Birney E.

The University of California, Santa Cruz/ENCODE Project data do not coincide precisely with our Fos/Jun ChIP findings, as shown in Fig. 2; perhaps this discrepancy is due to differences in the resolution with our ChIP methodology compared with the ChIP-seq method used to generate the Fos/Jun site from the ENCODE Project (see “Discussion” below) (20NCODE Project Consortium Birney E.

Nonetheless, our data highlight a region that is involved in transcriptional regulation of MMP-13 and that contains several AP-1 consensus sites (Fig. 3B). Regulatory regions such as response elements are often conserved (21Sakabe N.J. Nobrega M.A. Genome-wide maps of transcription regulatory elements.Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Systems Biology and Medicine. 2010; 2: 422-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and sequence analysis indicates that the ChIP-2 and ChIP-3 loci (along with ChIP-1 as previously mentioned), are conserved among vertebrates (Fig. 3A). Thus, the AcH4/H3K4me2 ChIP data suggest, along with the previous AP-1 ChIP data and sequence conservation, that the region around ChIP-1–3 is important for the regulation of MMP-13 expression. The data presented thus far support a role for the ChIP-1–3 region in regulating transcription of MMP-13. However, if direct interaction between response element-bound transcription-regulating factors and the transcription start site is required for regulating transcription, the large distance between this region and the transcription start site must be overcome. This would necessitate chromatin looping in order for regulatory factors bound at"
https://openalex.org/W2035636647,"Recently, a putative ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system was identified in Bifidobacterium longum NCC2705 that is highly up-regulated during growth on fructose as the sole carbon source. Cloning and expression of the corresponding ORFs (bl0033-0036) result in efficient fructose uptake by bacteria. Sequence analysis reveals high similarity to typical ABC transport systems and suggests that these genes are organized as an operon. Expression of FruE is induced by fructose, ribose, or xylose and is able to bind these sugars with fructose as the preferred substrate. Our data suggest that BL0033-0036 constitute a high affinity fructose-specific ABC transporter of B. longum NCC2705. We thus suggest to rename the coding genes to fruEKFG and the corresponding proteins to FruE (sugar-binding protein), FruK (ATPase subunit), FruF, and FruG (membrane permeases). Furthermore, protein-protein interactions between the components of the transporter complex were determined by GST pulldown and Western blot analysis. This revealed interactions between the membrane subunits FruF and FruG with FruE, which in vivo is located on the external side of the membrane, and with the cytoplasmatic ATPase FruK. This is in line with the proposed model for bacterial ABC sugar transporters."
