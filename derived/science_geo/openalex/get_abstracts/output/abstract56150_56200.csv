https://openalex.org/W2060710842,"Turnover of the rat liver tyrosine transaminase in vivo was measured by a label and chase procedure under conditions where the amount of enzyme undergoes no change. Half-life of the (14)C-labeled enzyme in this basal condition was found to be 1.5 +/- 0.3 hours. Inhibitors of protein synthesis (cycloheximide or puromycin) do not appreciably influence the basal enzyme level over a 5-hour period, although these drugs will block hormonal induction of this enzyme. In pulse-labeling experiments, cycloheximide blocked transaminase synthesis almost completely. The conclusion that enzyme degradation, as well as synthesis, must be blocked when protein synthesis is stopped was confirmed in experiments showing that labeled enzyme is stable in the liver of rats treated with cycloheximide The participation of a continuously synthesized polypeptide in the degradative phase of transaminase turnover is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1595514319,"Components of the electron transport system involved in steroid 11β-hydroxylation in pig adrenal cortex are a flavoprotein (adrenodoxin reductase), a non-heme iron protein (adrenodoxin), and possibly cytochrome P450. Reconstitution of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate cytochrome P450 reductase was achieved from soluble components. Adrenodoxin contains 2 iron atoms and 2 moles of labile sulfide per mole, has a molecular weight of approximately 20,000, and has a high oxidation-reduction potential. The iron atoms, which are ferric in the oxidized form, play a dual role: as a chromophore and as a center of asymmetry. Upon reduction, the environment of the iron of adrenodoxin is changed greatly as judged by spectral and optical rotatory properties."
https://openalex.org/W1523504920,"Abstract Pigeon liver malic enzyme (malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating), EC 1.1.1.38) was purified and crystallized from ammonium sulfate solution as its triphosphopyridine nucleotide complex. The crystalline protein is homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge, in gradient centrifugation, and in gradient chromatography. A constant specific activity of 28 units per mg of protein is obtained. The crystalline enzyme has an s20 of 10.0, an apparent diffusion coefficient of 3.17 x 10-7 cm2 per sec, and an apparent partial specific volume of 0.74. Its molecular weight is 2.8 x 105. Purified malic enzyme has an ultraviolet absorption maximum at 278 mµ. The extinction coefficients for the purified enzyme and the crystalline TPN complex are 0.86 and 0.92, respectively, for a 0.10% protein solution. The purified enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of oxalacetate at a rate comparable to the decarboxylation of malate. Reversible inactivation of these activities occurs upon storage of the enzyme. Reactivation is obtained by incubation with dithiothreitol."
https://openalex.org/W2110950236,"Abstract The properties of bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase with respect to the effects of purine nucleotides have been examined over a wide range of enzyme concentrations. Kinetic studies, with enzyme concentration up to 1 mg per ml have been performed with both guanosine triphosphate and diphosphate as inhibitors and adenosine diphosphate as an activator of the enzyme. Direct binding experiments have been performed to examine GTP binding in the presence of reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide over the range of 0.1 to 14.7 mg per ml. Both the kinetic and direct binding studies support the conclusion that, in the presence of coenzyme, GTP and GDP bind less tightly to the associated polymeric form (which has a molecular weight of 1.6 to 2 x 106 and is formed as a result of a concentration-dependent association reaction) than they do to the monomeric form of the enzyme (molecular weight, 4 x 105). The preferential binding of these nucleotides to monomer gives rise to an apparent cooperative interaction between inhibitor sites (either GTP or GDP) at enzyme concentrations greater than 0.1 mg per ml. No such effects exist at lower enzyme levels (l0.01 mg per ml), presumably because no polymer is present. In contrast to these results, ADP, which activates the reaction, has been found in the presence of reduced pyridine nucleotide to bind preferentially to the polymer rather than to the monomer. It is postulated that DPNII and reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide alone behave in the same manner as ADP. Experiments have been performed to evaluate the effect of both ADP and GTP (or GDP) simultaneously on the kinetic properties at high enzyme concentrations. Kinetic data and theory are presented for the situation where the enzyme concentration is larger than the dissociation constant for one of the ligands (that is, where the free and total ligand concentration cannot be considered to be equivalent) as is the case for inhibition by GTP. The theory is shown to be valid for a chemically modified glutamate dehydrogenase which is enzymatically normal in all respects but which cannot undergo association hat high enzyme concentrations. The theory presented here, however, is not adequate for native glutamate dehydrogenase presumably because of the preferential binding of GTP to the monomeric form of the enzyme. The consequence of preferential binding of purine nucleotides to different molecular weight species is discussed. It is noted that the ability of an enzyme to undergo association may be an important factor in relation to the effect of substrate or allosteric ligands on enzyme activity. Finally, it is shown by stop flow experiments that the specific activity of the enzyme in the absence of purine nucleotides is essentially independent of enzyme concentration."

The enzyme appears to be homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge, on starch gel electrophoresis and on polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the enzyme as determined by Sephadex chromatography is 80,000 to 100,000. The kinetics of the reaction was examined and found to be consistent with a double displacement mechanism involving formation of a glucose-enzyme complex and a subsequent reaction of this complex with acceptor to form the reaction products. Further evidence of the formation of a glucose-enzyme complex was obtained by isolating a denatured form of the complex. This complex contained 1 mole of glucose per mole of enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1608799015,"Abstract The enzyme tryptophan pyrrolase, which catalyzes the first irreversible step in the degradative metabolism of tryptophan in mammalian liver, has been purified by a new procedure which is simple and affords relatively high yields. The highly purified enzyme has been found to be strongly inhibited by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, which may be considered as the ultimate distal product of the conversion of tryptophan to functional nicotinyl derivatives. Kinetic analysis of the inhibition of tryptophan pyrrolase by NADPH indicates a type of allosteric inhibition. Other nicotinyl derivatives such as NADH, nicotinamide mononucleotide, nicotinamide, or nicotinic acid, are inhibitory to the enzyme, but only at considerably higher concentrations. Mild heating of purified tryptophan pyrrolase in the presence of tryptophan results in an enzyme which is no longer inhibited by NADPH but which still possesses a significant degree of tryptophan pyrrolase activity. Two fractions of tryptophan pyrrolase have been separated from each other on Sephadex G-200 columns. The highly active form of the enzyme, which is eluted with the void volume, is sensitive to NADPH inhibition, whereas the relatively inactive form, eluting well after the void volume, appears to be virtually insensitive to this inhibitor. On the basis of these studies the effect of NADPH upon tryptophan pyrrolase is postulated as conversion of a polymeric form of the enzyme to the monomeric, or relatively inactive, form by its action at a specific inhibitory site on the enzyme."

The toxicity of certain of these rotenoids to mice is of the same order as that of rotenone."
https://openalex.org/W1602459890,"Abstract The kinetics of tyrosine-α-ketoglutarate aminotransferase induction and subsequent inactivation has been studied in individual animals by a serial liver biopsy technique. A 15-fold increase in enzyme activity followed the administration of cortisol (30 mg per kg) to adrenalectomized rats. Peak levels occurred about 6 to 7 hours after hormone injection. The induced tyrosine aminotransferase activity then rapidly subsided to basal levels, with a half-time of 1.7 hours. During this inactivation phase the liver was not refractory to further cortisol stimulation, since a second dose of hormone at this time was capable of initiating another induction cycle. Puromycin inhibited enzyme synthesis when it was given during the initial phase of induction. However, it unexpectedly caused a rapid reappearance of enzyme activity following its administration during the inactivation phase. This potentiated response is consistent with other observations which lead to the idea that a repressor is formed about 4 hours after hormone administration and that inhibition of repressor synthesis allows, at least temporarily, continued synthesis of enzyme. Puromycin had little effect on basal tyrosine aminotransferase levels, and these findings suggest that the turnover of the enzyme under basal conditions may be much slower than the rate of inactivation of the induced enzyme. Administration of actinomycin during the early stages of induction (1 to 3 hours after hormone injection) curtailed further enzyme synthesis and prevented inactivation of the enzyme already induced. However, administration of actinomycin during the latter phase of induction (inactivation phase) had little effect and did not prevent the disappearance of induced tyrosine aminotransferase activity. From these data it appears that an inactivating system is formed during the induction cycle which is responsible for the removal of the induced enzyme. This suggestion is supported by the finding that the enzyme is stable when liver slices are prepared early in the induction cycle, but disappears rapidly from slices removed during the latter phase of induction. Although the nature of the inactivator is not known, its effects are dependent on pituitary function, since adrenalectomized and hypophysectomized animals showed little or no inactivation phase following hormone administration."
https://openalex.org/W1559910246,"Abstract When mice received injections twice daily of sodium phenobarbital there was a 2- to 4-fold increase in microsomal reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-cytochrome c reductase within 4 days. In order to measure the turnover of the enzyme, tritiated l-leucine was injected 24 hours prior to treatment. The half-time for loss in vivo of radioactivity from enzyme protein averaged 2.8 days in controls, but there was no loss of radioactivity from the enzyme in phenobarbital-treated animals. There was little change in specific activity, since decreased breakdown in treated animals was balanced by increased synthesis of unlabeled protein. The 90-min incorporation of l-leucine-3H into microsomal NADPH-cytochrome c reductase was increased 2- to 3-fold in mice pretreated for 2 or more days with sodium phenobarbital. The accumulation of microsomal NADPH-cytochrome c reductase in animals treated with barbiturates seems to result from both a decreased rate of breakdown and an increased rate of synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1515562537,"Abstract Phosphorylase b kinase was assayed in extracts prepared from perfused rat hearts treated with epinephrine. The amine produced modest but significant activation of the enzyme in extremely small doses. The activation was never as great as would be expected from studies in vitro of the purified enzyme. Increase in activity in proportion to the controls was greater when the assays were conducted at pH 6.8 than at pH 8.2, so that pH 6.8 to 8.2 ratios were increased. Isopropylnorepinephrine also activated the enzyme in perfused hearts, but methoxamine was without effect. Activation produced by a maximal dose of epinephrine (0.1 µg) was blocked by treatment of the hearts with the adrenergic blocking agents, dichloroisoproterenol and nethalide. When the dose of epinephrine was varied, activation of the enzyme closely paralleled the inotropic response. When a maximal dose (0.1 µg) of epinephrine was administered, phosphorylase b kinase was maximally activated in 1 sec, well ahead of the inotropic response which reached a peak in 10 sec. Activation of phosphorylase b kinase was almost identical in time with the rise in adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate levels. The levels of this cyclic nucleotide increased 9-fold in 1 sec after 0.1 µg of epinephrine was administered."
https://openalex.org/W1562621556,"Abstract 1. The C polysaccharide from pneumococci has been fractionated by gel filtration and by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl Sephadex. The results show that this material is composed of fractions ranging in molecular weight from 65,000 to over 200,000. Furthermore it was noted that all fractions contained the same hexosamine and amino acid components, but in markedly different proportions. 2. When the C polysaccharide is treated with trichloracetic acid it is cleaved into two main fractions, one of which is a 95% polymer of N-acetylgalactosamine phosphate. A similar polymer has been isolated in pure form from the detritus of autolyzed pneumococcal cells. This polymer is the major serological determinant of the pneumococcal C polysaccharide, and reacts with the human C-reactive protein. 3. By treatment of the C polysaccharide with periodate it has been possible to obtain a polymer containing only the components of mucopeptide. This mucopeptide is an active but minor pneumococcal antigen. It has been shown that there exists in human pleural and peritoneal fluids an enzyme or a set of enzymes capable of selectively removing the peptide from the pneumococcal mucopeptide. By the action of this enzyme it has been possible to prepare a polymer which on acid hydrolysis yields only muramic acid, muramic acid phosphate, and glucosamine, but no amino acids. This polymer fails to react with the pneumococcal antiserum studied, suggesting that the specificity of the antiserum is directed to the peptide moiety of the mucopeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1552245034,"A method for the purification of glutamate dehydrogenase from dogfish liver has been presented. The molecular weight of the enzyme has been determined and the sedimentation constant has been found to be invariant over a wide range of concentrations, in contrast to the bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase. Upon electrophoresis the dogfish enzyme has been observed to migrate further than the beef or chicken enzymes under all conditions studied. The kinetic parameters of the enzymatic reaction with the triphosphopyridine nucleotides have been explored; they indicate a sequential order of substrate addition analogous to that found for other glutamate dehydrogenases. The maximum velocities obtained by extrapolation of reciprocal plots of specific activities against low concentrations of reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide have been found to be virtually identical for bovine, chicken, and dogfish liver glutamate dehydrogenases."
https://openalex.org/W1540839643,"Abstract A relatively quick and simple assay method for the formation of 14C-mevalonic acid from 3-14C-β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl coenzyme A is described. The method has made possible demonstration of this biosynthetic reaction in vitro by a rat liver enzyme system. It has been shown that the reaction is quantitative, assuming only one biologically active isomer of the coenzyme A ester. For enzymatic activity there is an absolute requirement for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate as well as the presence of a reduced thiol. The location of the reductase activity has been found to be in the microsomal fraction. The particulate microsomal reductase has been solubilized by preparation of an acetone powder. This solubilization resulted in increased demonstrable activity. The solubilized material exhibited approximately the same requirements for reduction as did the original microsomes."
https://openalex.org/W1484365178,"Abstract Inhibition of the crystallized hog kidney flavoenzyme, d-amino acid oxidase, by tetraethylthiuram disulfide (disulfiram, TETD) has been found to involve the sulfhydryldisulfide exchange reaction; primary products of the interaction between oxidase and reagent are diethyldithiocarbamate ion and a derived protein carrying mixed disulfide linkages, each of which consists of an enzyme thiol sulfur atom linked to a diethyldithiocarbamyl residue. Evidence for this conclusion includes the following observations. One mole (taken as 105 g) of d-amino acid oxidase contains 6 to 8 immediately reactive sulfhydryl groups of a total of 12 such residues. The extent of of the oxidase is a linear function of the amount of TETD added; complete is attained with 6 to 8 mole eq of TETD. Studies with 35S-TETD reveal, in association with the inhibition, the liberation of 6 to 8 mole eq of diethyldithiocarbamate ion and the fixation to oxidase protein of 6 diethyldithiocarbamyl residues. If the native enzyme is denatured with detergent, 12 mole eq of diethyldithiocarbamate ion are produced directly. The disulfide character of TETD is requisite for its inhibitory action on d-amino acid oxidase. Related compounds without a disulfide bond, such as tetramethylthiuram monosulfide, do not inhibit the oxidase, whereas a variety of other disulfide reagents, including tetramethylthiuram disulfide, tetrathionate, oxidized glutathione, formamidine disulfide, and 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) are inhibitors. The stoichiometry of reaction between 35S-TETD and human oxyhemoglobin, in both the native and the denatured state, was found to compare favorably with predictions based on the sulfhydryl character of the protein and a comparable sulfhydryl-disulfide exchange reaction. The of d-amino acid oxidase by TETD, acting as a sulfhydryl-characterizing reagent, is time-dependent and irreversible; there is an associated conformational change of the oxidase protein. Flavin adenine dinucleotide retards the inhibitory process, whereas GSH prevents, but does not reverse, the inhibition. The over-all inhibitory process conforms to the criteria set forth earlier for the selective inhibition of polysulfhydryl enzymes by sulfhydryl-characterizing reagents."
https://openalex.org/W1494975527,"Abstract The role of pyridoxine and its coenzymically active derivatives in determining the stability of rat liver tyrosine α-ketoglutarate transaminase in vitro and in vivo was studied. Incubation of crude or purified holoenzyme preparations with cysteine and other amino acids causes removal of the coenzyme and subsequent inactivation of the inherently unstable apoenzyme; under these conditions the relatively stable glutamic-pyruvic transaminase retains its coenzyme and remains active. Inactivation of tyrosine transaminase is prevented by small amounts of 5'-phosphate derivatives of pyridoxine; the enzyme is also stabilized in solutions of high ionic strength. Evidence is presented that protection by coenzyme involves its reaction with enzymically active sites. The induction of tyrosine transaminase by pyridoxine administration does not reflect stabilization in vivo. Induction involves an increased rate of transaminase synthesis, determined immunochemically, and is inhibited by actinomycin D, and is thus similar to the inductions of this enzyme brought about by hydrocortisone and other hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1481161231,"Abstract Purified pigeon liver malic enzyme (malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating), EC 1.1.1.38) fluoresces strongly with excitation and emission maxima at 293 mµ and 350 mµ, respectively. Binding of reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide by malic enzyme was studied by the fluorescence technique. The purified enzyme binds TPNH strongly and causes a blue shift in the emission maximum of TPNH from 465 to 440 mµ, and an enhancement of fluorescence intensity. Titration of malic enzyme with TPNH yields a binding weight of 76,400 g of protein per mole of TPNH and a site dissociation constant of 7.5 x 10-7 m. l-Malate binds to the enzyme-TPNH complex in the presence of Mn++, but at a site other than the TPNH-binding site. The binding of enzyme with l-malate or TPNH is specific, and is not observed with either d-malate or reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide. TPN binds to malic enzyme in competition with TPNH. The ratio of site dissociation constants was determined, and from this, the dissociation constant for TPN is calculated to be 9.7 x 10-7 m."
https://openalex.org/W1541499770,"Abstract 1. Among the earliest and most sensitive consequences of glucocorticoid action are acceleration in the rate of purine nucleotide biosynthesis in liver and inhibition of this metabolic pathway in the thymus and spleen. 2. Hepatic tyrosine-α-ketoglutarate transaminase induction occurs concurrently with the accelerated hepatic purine nucleotide biosynthesis; these metabolic alterations in the liver precede inhibited thymic purine nucleotide and protein metabolism. 3. The product of tyrosine transaminase catalysis, glutamic acid, administered parenterally to adrenalectomized rats, mimics cortisone in stimulating in liver and inhibiting in thymus the rates of purine nucleotide and protein biosyntheses. These facts are compatible with the hypothesis that augmented gluconeogenesis and hepatic transaminase induction following glucocorticoid administration result in enhanced glutamate formation, which influences hepatic and thymic purine nucleotide and protein biosynthesis. Thus, hepatically generated glutamate may serve as an amplifying mechanism by which glucocorticoids influence metabolic processes in various target organs. 4. Analytically demonstrable liver glycogen deposition occurs only after impairment of thymic metabolism and following elevation of the blood sugar levels. Thus, glycogen deposition is a relatively secondary and late consequence of glucocorticoid action. 5. Orotate-5-3H incorporation into liver acid-soluble uridine monophosphate is only slightly influenced by cortisone, whereas its incorporation into ribonucleic acid is significantly elevated, thus providing isotopic evidence for hormonally enhanced generalized hepatic ribonucleic acid biosynthesis."

An oxidation-reduction potential of -0.28 volt has been calculated for flavodoxin from spectrophotometric measurements of the equilibrium reaction of reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide and flavodoxin catalyzed by spinach triphosphopyridine nucleotide reductase. Flavodoxin has been shown to replace bacterial ferredoxin in the reduction of TPN by extracts of Clostridium pasteurianum and to replace plant ferredoxin in the reduction of TPN by illuminated chloroplasts."

Drug-injected rats did not avoid the foot shock more frequently than controls, although the experi mental rats did have shorter response latencies fn the active avoidance task. In sub sequent experiments which measured activity changes and response to the buzzing sound alone, it was found that magnesium pemoline caused a lesser decrease in activity level and a more sustained responsivity to the buzzer's. sound than did control injections of tragacanth. This may account for the latency differences observed in the avoidance task."

https://openalex.org/W1623108667,Abstract The radiolabeled protein derivative obtained after treatment with sodium borohydride of a suitable reaction mixture permitting interaction of crystallized d-amino acid oxidase and the substrate d-alanine-1-14C has been identified as a reduction product of an enzyme-substrate intermediate involving the e-amino group of a lysyl residue of the enzyme protein. Acid hydrolysis of the protein and appropriate resolution of the hydrolysate have provided evidence of the identity of the labeled fragment with e-N-(1-carboxyethyl)-l-lysine which has been synthesized and characterized in this work. Initial intermediate combination of the substrate with the isoalloxazine ring of the flavonucleotide had been postulated in interpretation of the results of studies leading to the current investigation. It is of interest that a stable linkage of the amino acid skeleton with flavin adenine dinucleotide was found to be absent as a component of the final reduced protein product when d-alanine had been used as substrate. Our earlier hypothesis concerning the mechanism of catalysis by d-amino acid oxidase has been amplified with suggestions regarding the possible role in the enzymatic process of a particular lysyl residue of the enzyme-protein.
https://openalex.org/W1662591199,"Abstract Glutamate dehydrogenase, purified 160-fold by ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose and Bio-Gel P-300, was characterized as a catalyst of both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduction and NADPH oxidation at the optimal pH of each reaction (8.7 and 7.7, respectively). In the pH range 7.5 to 8, the rate of enzyme-catalyzed NADPH oxidation is 10 to 15 times greater than the rate of NADP+ reduction. The enzyme is specific for NADPH (Km, 4.9 x 10-5 m), α-keto-glutarate (Km, 4.3 mm), NADP+ (Km, 7.9 x 10-6 m), and glutamate (Km, 6.7 mm). The Km for NH4Cl is 16 mm. The oxidation of NADPH was 50% inhibited by 0.5 m NaCl or NH4Cl, 20 mm d-glutamate, 2 x 10-4 m NADH, 10-3 m NADP+, 4.4 x 10-4 m NADPH, and 5 µm p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. The reduction of NADP+ was 50% inhibited by 1 mm NH4Cl, 20 mm d-glutamate or β-alanine, 4 x 10-4 m NADH, and 3 x 10-5 m NADPH. Enzyme activity was not affected by 2 x 10-4 m adenosine or guanosine triphosphate. It appears that in Nitrosomonas the enzyme catalyzes the reaction primarily in the direction of glutamate formation and has a high enough activity to account for all cellular amino nitrogen."

https://openalex.org/W1543128480,"Abstract The properties of a 100-fold purified preparation of rat liver galactose dehydrogenase are presented. Optimum activity occurs at pH 8.3. The enzyme is relatively stable to dialysis, heat treatment, and storage at -30°, but is quite unstable below pH 5. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, but not galactose, protects from heat inactivation. Heat inactivation kinetics suggests that one enzyme is responsible for galactose oxidation. Activity is strongly inhibited by sulfhydryl group inhibitors, Cu++, Zn++, and Fe++, yet sulfhydryl reagents do not enhance activity or protect from inactivation. Activity was not inhibited by cyanide, arsenate, or ethylenediaminetetraacetate. The Km for galactose is 2.6 x 10-2 m and for NAD is 1.7 x 10-4 m. The Vmax is 0.57 µmole per min per mg of protein. The reaction product, NADH, is a strong competitive inhibitor of galactose dehydrogenase (Ki, 3.4 x 10-5 m). The cofactor NADP is less than 1% as effective as NAD, and it competitively inhibits (Ki, 6.6 x 10-3 m). NADPH is also a competitive inhibitor (Ki, 1.2 x 10-3 m). The enzyme preparation has a very broad specificity for sugar substrates, reduction of NAD (but not of NADP) occurring in the presence of various aldohexoses, aldopentoses, aldoheptoses, and disaccharides. The specificity patterns suggest the presence of at least three aldose dehydrogenases with very specific steric requirements for substrates. Studies with combinations of sugars, heat inactivation, and starch gel electrophoresis were more consistent with the presence of a single enzyme of unusual substrate specificity. Heat inactivation kinetics suggests two maltoseoxidizing enzymes. The NAD-reduction reactions occurring with l-aldohexoses, aldoheptoses, maltose, and cellobiose suggest novel reactions hitherto unrecognized in mammalian tissues. Some keto sugars behave as substrates, probably by isomerization to corresponding aldo sugars, but an unusual direct oxidation was not excluded. Developmental changes in rat liver galactose dehydrogenase show that activity is barely detectable until birth, when a sudden increase occurs, reaching a maximum in animals 5 days old and falling slowly to the adult level in animals 30 days of age."
https://openalex.org/W1552144563,"Abstract Diphosphopyridine nucleosidases (DPNases) were solubilized from acetone powders prepared from some mammalian tissues. Solubilization was effected by the action of porcine pancreatic lipase on DPNases that are resistant to solubilization by trypsin and which heretofore had not been solubilized. Molecular weight estimates made on DPNases obtained from porcine, bovine, sheep, dog, horse, mouse, rabbit, and human tissues, as well as mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor cells indicate that these enzymes fall into three size classes: porcine, bovine, and sheep, ∼25,000; dog, ∼50,000; and the remainder between 70,000 and 90,000. The electrophoretic characteristics of the DPNases indicate that with the exception of the sheep brain material all the low molecular weight enzymes migrate toward the cathode at pH 7.0. The sheep DPNase as well as the enzymes from all the other sources studied migrate in the opposite direction. The mouse ascites cell, rat, rabbit, and sheep preparations are particularly interesting in that they show a number of multiple forms that are enzymatically active. Notwithstanding the variability in molecular weight and electrophoretic mobility, the solubilized mammalian DPNases exhibit similar although not identical catalytic properties in their sensitivity to nicotinamide inhibition, specificity to DPN+ and TPN+, and formation of the 3-acetylpyridine analogue of DPN+. A new catalytic stain is described that is specific for DPNases which carry out the exchange reaction with pyridine bases."

The purified material appeared to be homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge; an s20,w value of 2.5 and a molecular weight of 26,000 were derived for the enzyme. The protein gave one precipitin band, indicative of one species of antigen, to a specific rabbit antibody. Less than 5% contaminant was present in the purified material as determined by cellulose acetate electrophoresis. Amino acid composition of the pig brain enzyme differed significantly from that of Bacillus subtilis diphosphopyridine nucleosidase. The purified enzyme and the acetone powder exhibited identical catalytic properties with respect to hydrolysis of diphosphopyridine nucleotide, 3-acetylpyridine exchange, and specificity for DPN+ and TPN+, as well as identical pH profiles. The trypsin-solubilized enzyme, and material solubilized with lipase, had molecular weights of 26,000 and 25,000 (±1,000), respectively, on Sephadex G-100. Both solubilized forms of the enzyme had the same electrophoretic mobility as determined by a staining technique developed to test for catalytic properties of mammalian diphosphopyridine nucleosidases. These results indicate that the purified material possesses the same catalytic properties present in the acetone powder and that solubilization with trypsin does not alter the native protein since it is identical with lipase-solubilized material."

https://openalex.org/W1538050338,"Abstract Neurospora nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-specific glutamate dehydrogenase is predominantly in an inactive form at pH 7.2, is fully active above pH 8.0, and is partially active at intermediate pH values. Between pH 7.0 and 7.4, and in the absence of NADPH, the enzyme is activated by the substrates 2-oxoglutarate and glutamate, as well as by the nonsubstrates citrate, isocitrate, succinate, malate, fumarate, oxalacetate, or ethylenediaminetetraacetate. Curves relating activation to activator or substrate concentration were found to be sigmoid, indicating cooperation between activating molecules. At lower pH values the addition of NADPH results in nearly complete inactivation. Under these conditions activation requires 2-oxoglutarate specifically; glutamate or nonsubstrate acids have no activating effect. However, 2-oxoglutarate activates even better than in the absence of NADPH. NADP+ causes some activation by itself and enhances activation by 2-oxoglutarate, glutamate, and succinate. It is concluded that the enzyme has allosteric properties, the possible regulatory significance of which is briefly discussed. Properties previously reported for certain mutant varieties of this enzyme obtained from amination-deficient (am) mutants and their partial revertants are now seen as distorted manifestations of the normal allosteric interactions reported here for the enzyme obtained from a wild type strain."
https://openalex.org/W1565454738,The enzymatic synthesis of uridine diphospho-N-acetyl muramic acid by cell-free preparations from Aerobacter cloacae NRC 492 has been demonstrated. The results suggest the following sequence of reactions for the biosynthesis of UDP-muramic acid. UDP-GlcNAc + P-enolpyruvate ⇌ UDP-GlcNAc-pyruvate + Pi (1) UDP-GlcNAc-pyruvate + NADPH ⇌ UDP-muramic acid + NADP+ (2)
https://openalex.org/W2140118460,"Abstract Highly purified commercial alkaline phosphatase preparations from Escherichia coli have been shown to catalyze the transfer of a phosphoryl group of inorganic pyrophosphate to the hydroxyl group attached to carbon atom 6 of glucose. Phosphotransferase activity also was detected with relatively crude chicken intestinal alkaline phosphatase preparations. The E. coli enzyme was further characterized relative to catalytic properties. Adenosine 5'-phosphate, diphosphate, and triphosphate, cytidine 5'-phosphate and diphosphate, guanosine triphosphate, and mannose 6-phosphate functioned as alternate phosphoryl donors. Activity with PPi as substrate was observed between pH 5 and 9, with a maximum at pH 7.9. Km (PPi), 0.83 mm, was independent of glucose concentration. Maximal activity was observed with 1.25 m glucose; higher concentrations of this hexose inhibited both phosphotransferase and phosphohydrolase activities of the enzyme. Maximally, in the presence of 1.25 m glucose, the phosphotransferase activity involved the participation of 9% of reacting inorganic pyrophosphate; the remaining 91% of the reacted phosphoanhydride substrate was hydrolyzed. The phosphotransferase activity resembled inorganic pyrophosphatase activity of the preparation with respect to effects of pH, pyrophosphate concentration requirement, and thermolability at 30° in the absence of substrates. Glucose 6-phosphatase and AMPase activities of the preparation also were progressively inactivated by mild heating in a manner similar to that of phosphotransferase and inorganic pyrophosphatase activities; however, β-glycerol phosphate hydrolysis was more stable, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis activity was considerably more labile to this treatment than were the other four activities studied. A number of alternative explanations for differences in stability of these hydrolytic activities attributed to alkaline phosphatase are presented. While the high glucose requirement and relatively low ratio of phosphotransferase to phosphohydrolase activity of the enzyme make a biologically significant role for the synthetic activity questionable, it is suggested that the phosphotransferase reaction may provide a tool for further studies relating to the reaction mechanism of alkaline phosphatase."

https://openalex.org/W1496776835,"Abstract Comparison of electron spin resonance signals of mitochondria, microsomes, and mitochondrial subfractions from the bovine adrenal cortex with the signals from rabbit liver microsomes have been made at temperatures near that of liquid helium. No evidence for the existence of an iron protein with g = 1.94 in liver microsomes could be obtained, whereas the presence of this component in adrenal cortical particles was confirmed. It was not possible to distinguish between the mitochondrial iron proteins of Beinert and those concerned with mixed function oxidation of steroids, and the relationship between mitochondrial electron transport and mixed function oxidation of steroids in the adrenal cortex remains uncertain."
https://openalex.org/W1673119122,"Abstract The synthesis of unlabeled and tritium-labeled cholest-5-ene-3β,7α,12α-triol is described. The formation of cholest-5-ene-3β,7α,12α-triol was shown in incubations of cholesterol and cholest-5-ene-3β,7α-diol with the 20,000 x g supernatant fluid of rat liver homogenates and of cholest-5-ene-3β,7α-diol with the microsomal fraction fortified by addition of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Cholest-5-ene-3β,7α,12α-triol was found to be converted to 7α,12α-dihydroxycholest-4-en-3-one in the presence of mitochondrial or microsomal fraction fortified with NAD or NADP. The microsomal fraction was more active than the mitochondrial fraction and NAD was several times more active than NADP."
https://openalex.org/W1543410520,"Abstract Halogenated tyrosine transaminase has been purified 30-fold from a sonic extract of rat kidney mitochondria. Purification involves ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose and hydroxylapatite. The purified enzyme is highly specific for tyrosine analogues with halogen substituents in positions 3 or 3 and 5, for thyroid hormones, and, to a lesser extent, for naturally occurring aromatic amino acids such as tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine. The identity of the enzyme and thyroid hormone transaminase has been confirmed. Halogenated tyrosine transaminase requires pyridoxal 5'-phosphate as a coenzyme and α-ketoglutarate as amino acceptor. Inhibition studies indicate that a sulfhydryl group is essential for enzyme activity. 3,5-Diiodo-4-hydroxyphenylacetate has been found to be a powerful inhibitor of the enzyme, functioning as a mixed type of inhibitor. The reaction catalyzed by this enzyme is: halogenated tyrosine + α-ketoglutarate → halogenated p-hydroxyphenylketo acid + glutamate."
https://openalex.org/W1542306754,"Abstract Extraction of freeze-dried chloroplasts for 4 hours with heptane at 22° removes up to 90% of the plastoquinones without significant extraction of chlorophyll. Photoreduction of indophenol and of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate is decreased after extraction. The photoreduction of NADP with ascorbate and indophenol as electron donor is restored by plastoquinone C, whereas photoreduction of indophenol or NADP with water as electron donor requires both plastoquinones A and C for restoration. The restoration of NADP photoreduction with ascorbate and tetramethylphenylenediamine as electron donor is not restored by plastoquinones A and C, but is restored by a red protein, rubimedin, which is released from the chloroplasts during the extraction treatment. Other lipid material from the heptane extract may also be necessary to complement the rubimedin effect. Rubimedin also increases the amount of NADP reduction by water above the restoration obtained with plastoquinones A and C. A split pathway of electron transport is proposed, part going through plastoquinones A and C and part through rubimedin. Indophenol would react with the electron transport chain at plastoquinone C."
https://openalex.org/W1577368534,"Abstract A polarographic technique suitable for kinetic studies of either isolated or bound pyridine nucleotide-linked dehydrogenases was used to investigate the isocitrate dehydrogenases of yeast mitochondria. Intact mitochondria were found to contain both triphosphopyridine nucleotide- and diphosphopyridine nucleotide-linked isocitrate dehydrogenases with properties very similar to those which have been reported for the isolated dehydrogenases. The DPN-linked enzyme in situ exhibits a nonclassical, sigmoid substrate against activity relationship with respect to isocitrate and is activated by adenosine 5'-monophosphate. The TPN-linked enzyme in situ exhibits a hyperbolic substrate against activity relationship which is unaffected by AMP. The DPN-linked dehydrogenase also shows another non-classical increase in activity that occurs in response to high isocitrate concentrations or to heat treatment. This activation is characteristic only of untreated, intact mitochondria and may be secondary to an alteration of the mitochondria themselves."

https://openalex.org/W173824089,"Abstract Rabbit antibody prepared against native bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase is not a competitive inhibitor of coenzyme at active sites or of nucleotides at modifier (allosteric) sites. The antibody, indeed, activates glutamate dehydrogenase at the active sites of both bovine and frog liver enzymes. At modifier sites the antibody is antagonistic to the effects of purine nucleotides. For example, the antibody partially inhibits the activating effects of adenosine diphosphate and the inhibitory effects of guanosine triphosphate on glutamate dehydrogenase activity. Immunochemical and kinetic experiments indicate that there is a great deal of antigenic similarity between the bovine and frog liver enzymes. These results suggest that the antigenic sites are quite similar in both the bovine and frog enzymes and are not active or allosteric sites. It is possible that antibody is bound to a part of the enzyme molecule which contains neither active nor allosteric sites and which is structurally similar from species to species, while active and allosteric sites differ from species to species."
https://openalex.org/W1542448467,"Abstract Crude extracts of Salmonella typhi catalyze the conversion of cytidine diphosphate d-glucose to CDP-tyvelose. Two intermediates in this reaction sequence have been identified as CDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose and CDP-paratose. The enzyme catalyzing the conversion of CDP-d-glucose to CDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose (CDP-d-glucose oxidoreductase) has been purified approximately 50-fold from these extracts, and its properties have been studied. The product of the reaction, CDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose, was characterized by chemical reduction. Mild acid hydrolysis of the reduced nucleotide yielded two 6-deoxyhexoses which were identified as d-fucose (6-deoxygalactose) and 6-deoxy-d-glucose by chromatographic, chemical, and enzymatic methods CDP-d-glucose oxidoreductase has been shown to require nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. The enzyme was not activated by NADP+. However, the over-all reaction from CDP-d-glucose to CDP-tyvelose has been shown to require NADPH, indicating that this cofactor is involved at a later step in the reaction sequence."
